4048,0.015,15.0,"The government of Zimbabwe began providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in public institutions in 2004. In Midlands province two clinics constituted the most active HIV care service points, with patients being followed up through a comprehensive patient monitoring and tracking system which captured specific patient variables and outcomes over time. The data from 2006 to 2011 were subjected to analysis to answer specific research questions and this case study is based on that analysis. The goal of this case study is to build participants' capacity to undertake secondary data analysis and interpretation using a dataset for HIV antiretroviral therapy in Zimbabwe and to draw conclusions which inform recommendations. Case studies in applied epidemiology allow students to practice applying epidemiologic skills in the classroom to address real-world public health problems. Case studies as a vital component of an applied epidemiology curriculum are instrumental in reinforcing principles and skills covered in lectures or in background reading. The target audience includes Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programs (FELTPs), university students, district health executives, and health information officers."
8438,0.014,14.0,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy era, medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) have become critical issues for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). The purpose of this study was to test explanatory models of how patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction are related to medication adherence and HRQOL for PLWH. A total of 344 PLWH receiving health-care services from a federally funded clinic in the southwest USA completed a survey questionnaire about their perception of interactions with providers, their satisfaction with services, their medication adherence, and their HRQOL. Comparing four latent variable structural equation models of direct and mediated effects of patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction, the findings illustrate that the best model is one in which patient-provider interaction has a direct and positive effect on patient satisfaction, medication adherence, and HRQOL. These findings suggest that quality patient-provider interaction is a critical element of health-care services for PLWH, while patient satisfaction is an outcome measure and not a mediating factor for medication adherence and HRQOL.

5673,0.013,13.0,"Initiation of efavirenz-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is associated with Vitamin D deficiency, but the risk factors including efavirenz pharmacokinetics for cART-induced severe vitamin D deficiency (SVDD) and the impact of anti-tuberculosis (TB) cotreatment are not explored. We investigated the prevalence of SVDD in HIV and TB-HIV coinfected patients and associated risk factors for treatment-induced SVDD.Treatment-naïve Ethiopian HIV patients with (n = 102) or without (n = 89) TB co-infection were enrolled prospectively and received efavirenz-based cART. In TB-HIV coinfected patients, rifampicin-based anti-TB treatment was initiated 4 or 8 weeks before starting cART. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D), cholesterol and 4-beta hydroxycholesterol concentrations were measured at baseline, 4, 16, and 48 week of cART. Plasma efavirenz concentrations were determined at 4 and 16 weeks of cART.TB-HIV patients had significantly lower plasma 25 (OH)D3 levels than HIV-only patients at baseline. TB co-infection, low Karnofsky score, high viral load, and high CYP3A activity as measured by plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratios were significant predictors of low 25 (OH)D3 levels at baseline. In HIV-only patients, initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVVD from 27% at baseline to 76%, 79%, and 43% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively. The median 25 (OH)D3 levels declined from baseline by -40%, -50%, and -14% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively.In TB-HIV patients, previous anti-TB therapy had no influence on 25 (OH)D3 levels, but the initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVDD from 57% at baseline to 70% and 72% at the 4 and 16 weeks of cART, respectively. Median plasma 25 (OH)D3 declined from baseline by -17% and -21% at week 4 and 16 of cART, respectively.Our results indicate low plasma cholesterol, high CYP3A activity, and high plasma efavirenz concentrations as significant predictors of early efavirenz-based cART-induced vitamin D deficiency. Low plasma 25 (OH)D3 level at baseline is associated with TB co-infection and HIV diseases progression. Initiation of efavirenz-based cART is associated with high incidence of SVDD, whereas rifampicin based anti-TB therapy co-treatment has no significant effect. Supplementary vitamin D during cART initiation may be beneficial for HIV patients regardless of TB coinfection. "
5402,0.012,12.0,"Routine military screening identified human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in an asymptomatic dentist who had three prior negative antibody tests. A look-back investigation evaluated the provider and the practice and provided notification, counseling, and HIV testing for patients. Test results were linked to dental procedures categorized by levels of invasiveness. Of 1631 patients tested, all were negative for antibody to HIV. Analysis of 12,164 procedures on 876 patients determined 20.5% of patients had procedures from the highest stratum of invasiveness; 42% had only low-risk exposure. Stratification of the degree of invasive exposure and clinical evaluation of disease stage in the infected health care worker are important in look-back investigations. The early stage of disease in the provider, the adherence to infection control precautions, and the low percentage of invasive procedures may have contributed to the lack of transmission. These results are consistent with current assessment that risk of transmission of HIV during invasive medical procedures is low."
4248,0.012,12.0,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) usually have an unfavorable clinical outcome in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients. In Egypt, data about epidemiology, the spectrum of disease, and impact of HDV on HBV infection are rare. To assess the prevalence, clinical and virological characteristics of HDV infection among Egyptian patients with chronic HBV. Adult patients with Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive were evaluated for the presence of HDV using anti HDV-IgG and HDV RNA by RT-PCR. Routine laboratory investigations, genotypes and subtypes for both HBV and HDV, abdominal sonography, and transient elastography (TE) were done. Liver biopsy was performed only in whenever indicated. One hundred and twenty-one treatment-naïve chronic HBV patients were included. Wild HBV genotype-D2 was found in 98.2% and 81.9% were HBeAg negative. Prevalence of HDV was 8.3% by anti-HDV IgG and 9.9% by RT-PCR. Wild HDV genotype-IIb was reported in 83.3%. HDV infection was more common in males, 90.9% of delta patients were HBeAg negative. Compared to the mono-infected HBV, concomitant HBV/HDV infection was not associated with more derangment in ALT nor advanced stage of fibrosis. 66.7% of HDV patients had significantly lower HBV-DNA level compared to the non-delta patients (P < 0.001). HDV is not uncommon in Egypt. HBV genotype-D was associated with HDV genotype-IIb. Delta infection was associated with negative HBeAg status, reduction of HBV replication, but neither influenced the clinical course nor increased significant liver damage risk."
9923,0.012,12.0,"The recent expansion of antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage in middle/low-income countries has been associated with increasing prevalence of HIV pre-ART drug resistance (PDR). We assessed PDR prevalence, patterns, and trends in Guatemala. Blood samples from 1,084 ART-naive individuals, enrolled from October 2010 to December 2013 at the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala City, were obtained. PDR was evaluated using the WHO mutation list for transmitted drug resistance (TDR) surveillance. An overall PDR prevalence of 7.3% (95% CI 5.8-9.0%) was observed for the whole study period. TDR to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) was the highest (4.9%, p<0.001), followed by nucleoside RT inhibitors (1.8%) and protease inhibitors (1.0%). No significant trends in PDR prevalence were observed during the study period. However, higher NNRTI PDR levels were found in individuals with >500 and 350-500 CD4(+) T cells/μl (7.4% and 8.7%, respectively) compared to individuals with <350 CD4(+) T cells/μl (3.7%; p=0.039 and p=0.007, respectively), as well as a tendency of higher levels of NNRTI transmitted drug resistance (DR) in individuals with recent infection determined by HIV incidence tests (9.7%), suggesting increasing trends in time. Clusters of viruses with NNRTI PDR suggesting complex transmission networks were observed. No associations between PDR and demographic variables were found. PDR in Guatemala remains at an intermediate level. Nevertheless, we have shown evidence suggesting increasing trends in NNRTI PDR, which need to be taken into account in national HIV management policies."
4563,0.012,12.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection alters the epidemiology of mycobacterial infections. In the industrialised world, this has led to an increase in severe illness associated with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and, in the developing world, to doubling of tuberculosis cases in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The interaction with Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs when the CD4 count is relatively high (> 200) and tuberculosis (TB) is now the commonest presenting AIDS defining disease in Africa. In international public health terms the interaction between TB and HIV infection has led to the World Health Organisation declaring TB to be a global emergency. Both TB and HIV are diseases of poverty and the key to the reduction of incidence of both diseases is the improvement of socio-economic conditions. Other control methods are case finding and treatment, chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccination. Finding active (sputum positive) case of tuberculosis and treating them is the function of TB control programmes in all countries, but poor adherence to medication has lead to low cure rates and increasing development of drug resistance. Resources are needed to improve adherence to medication and for research to improve diagnostic methods and treatment."
8267,0.012,12.0,"It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that efforts to optimize nutritional status through individualized medical nutrition therapy, assurance of food and nutrition security, and nutrition education are essential to the total system of health care available to people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection throughout the continuum of care. Broad-based efforts to improve health care access and treatment have stabilized HIV prevalence levels in many parts of the world and led to longer survival for people living with HIV infection. Confounding clinical and social issues, such as medication interactions, comorbidities, wasting, lipodystrophy, food insecurity, aging, and other related conditions further complicate disease management. With greater understanding of the mechanisms of HIV disease and its impact on body function, development of new treatments, and wider ranges of populations affected, the management of chronic HIV infection continues to become more complex and demanding. Achievement of food and nutrition security and management of nutrition-related complications of HIV infection remain significant challenges for clients with HIV infection and health care professionals. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, should integrate their efforts into the overall health care strategies to optimize their clinical and social influence for people living with HIV infection."
6463,0.011,11.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapies potentially suppress HBV viral load to an undetectable level reducing the risk of progressive liver disease and the development of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Adherence to antiviral therapies is imperative to achieve and maintain viral suppression. To date, there has been limited research on adherence to HBV therapies. Our study aimed to explore factors influencing adherence to antiviral therapy. A total of 29 participants consented to in-depth qualitative interviews at three outpatient clinics in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were initially classified as adherent or nonadherent and thematic analysis was used to identify dominant themes. Adherent behavior was reported by 59% (n = 17) of participants. Several themes influenced adherence including routine, fear of HBV-related disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, and forgetfulness. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to explore adherence to HBV antiviral therapy. An interplay of several dominant themes emerged from our data including fear of chronic HBV disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, routine, and forgetfulness. Study findings have the potential to change nursing clinical practice, especially the way nurses and other clinicians target key HBV treatment messages and education, while monitoring adherence."
3236,0.011,11.0,"The value of CD4 lymphocyte counts as a surrogate marker in persons with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection during antiretroviral treatment was assessed using longitudinal models and data from the Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS didanosine/zalcitabine trial of 467 HIV-infected patients. Patients with AIDS or two CD4 counts of < or = 300 who fulfilled specific criteria for zidovudine intolerance or failure were randomized to receive either 500 mg didanosine (ddl) daily or 2.25 mg zalcitabine (ddC) per day. Absolute CD4 counts were recorded at study entry and at as many as four visits. Patients were followed for clinical disease progression and survival. At 2 months, the difference in mean CD4 count from baseline was +15.4 cells/mm3 in the ddI group but -1.3 cells/mm3 in the ddC group. Patients assigned to ddI had a greater chance of a CD4 response at 2 months than those on ddC, yet only those in the ddC group with a response showed significant improvement in progression of disease or survival compared with ddC nonresponders, ddI responders, and ddI nonresponders (p = 0.03). We conclude that a CD4 response does not necessarily correlate with improved outcome and is therefore not a useful surrogate marker in these patients."
6768,0.01,10.0,"Cases of tuberculosis identified during 1992-1994 through an active tuberculosis surveillance network among six hospitals that serve New York City (the TBNetwork) were analyzed according to the occupational status of the patients. Clinical data were obtained by review of medical records, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was performed. No known nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred at these hospitals in the study period. Occupational status was known for 142 of 201 patients whose isolates were available for strain typing. Patients infected by organisms with a clustered strain typing pattern, as determined by RFLP analysis, were presumed to have recently acquired disease. RFLP typing revealed that isolates from 13 (65%) of 20 health care workers and 50 (41%) of 122 non-health care workers had a clustered RFLP pattern. The strains infecting eight (89%) of nine health care workers seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had a clustered RFLP pattern. Multivariate analysis of 75 patients with known HIV and occupational status revealed that HIV status (P = .03) and health care worker status (P = .02; RR = 2.77) were independent risk factors for a clustered RFLP strain. These findings suggest that many of the apparently sporadic cases of tuberculosis among health care workers may be due to unrecognized occupational transmission."
2359,0.01,10.0,"There is growing international concern that food insecurity may negatively impact antiretroviral (ARV) treatment outcomes, but no studies have directly evaluated the effect of food insecurity on viral load suppression and antiretroviral adherence. We hypothesized that food insecurity would be associated with poor virologic response among homeless and marginally housed HIV-positive ARV-treated patients."
355,0.01,10.0,"HIV increases the risk of liver disease as do two common coinfections, hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV). However, whether combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) reverses or exacerbates hepatic fibrosis remains unclear.This was an observational retrospective study. cART-naïve HIV-infected subjects without a history of substance abuse (including alcohol) had liver disease stage determined by aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio indices (APRIs) and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) before and 24 and 48 weeks after cART. All the data were retrieved from previously established cohorts. Values before and after cART were compared using Wilcoxon test for paired samples. Regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with moderate-to-severe liver disease.Of the 1105 HIV-infected subjects, 120 were HBV coinfected and 64 were HCV coinfected. About 20% of HIV monoinfected participants had APRI and FIB-4 scores consistent with moderate-to-significant fibrosis compared to ∼36% of HIV-HBV coinfected and 67% to 77% of HIV-HCV coinfected participants. In adjusted analyses compared with HIV monoinfection, HBV coinfection was associated with 1.18-fold higher APRI (P < 0.001) and a 1.12-fold higher FIB-4 (P = 0.007) prior to cART; while HCV coinfection was associated with 1.94-fold higher APRI (P < 0.001) and a 1.43-fold higher FIB-4 (P < 0.001). After 48 weeks of cART, both fibrosis scores decreased in all subjects; however, HCV coinfection was still associated with higher fibrosis scores at week 48 compared to HIV monoinfection.cART was associated with improvement in hepatic fibrosis scores in the majority of HIV-hepatitis coinfected and HIV-monoinfected Chinese participants."
6369,0.01,10.0,"As of October 2006, 6 medications are approved in the United States for the management of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection: 2 formulations of interferon and 4 oral nucleos(t)ide analogues. For the treating practitioner, tailoring the pharmaceutical regimen according to patient features and clinical circumstances can be a challenge. First-line therapeutic regimens for the management of HBV infection include monotherapy with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agent that has potent on-treatment viral response and low rates of resistance; in the future, these regimens may include a combination of more than one nucleos(t)ide analogue or a combination of a nucleos(t)ide analogue and pegylated interferon. The oral nucleos(t)ide analogues are generally better tolerated than interferon; however, they can be expensive when administered for lengthy periods and can also lead to medication resistance. Lamivudine, the first approved nucleoside analogue for the treatment of HBV infection, has a very high resistance profile; in fact, lamivudine exposure increases viral resistance to other commercially available nucleos(t)ide analogues: entecavir, telbivudine, and adefovir. For these reasons, the 2007 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines no longer recommend lamivudine as first-line therapy for the management of HBV infection. A satellite symposium conducted during the 57th Annual Meeting of the AASLD in Boston, Massachusetts, presented approaches to customizing the management of chronic HBV infection. The presentation highlighted recent findings suggesting that early, profound, and sustained viral suppression improves the probability of sustained virologic response and reduces the likelihood of nucleos(t)ide resistance."
9178,0.01,10.0,"This study aimed to determine the prevalence and species of Cryptosporidium among HIV/AIDS patients in southwest of Iran. Two hundred fifty faecal samples from HIV patients were examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts using a conventional coproscopic approach. Such oocysts were detected in 18 (7.2%) out of 250 faecal samples. Genomic DNAs from 250 samples were then subjected to a nested-PCR-RFLP technique targeting different loci of 18S rRNA gene for species identification. Out of 250 samples, 27 (10.8%) were positive for different Cryptosporidium spp; Restriction patterns resulting from the digestion of the nested amplicon with restriction endonucleases VspI and SspI showed that C. parvum (70.38%) was the most prevalent species, followed by C. hominis (25.92%) and C. meleagridis (3.7%), respectively. The mean CD4+ T-cell count was 215 cells/μL. There was a strong association between cryptosporidiosis and CD4+ T-cell count (P = 0.000) with the highest prevalence recorded among patients with CD4+ T-cell count < 200 cells/μL. This confirms that there is a low opportunity for this parasite to get established as the patients CD4+ T-cell count increases. Also HIV infection increased the risk of having Cryptosporidium. Our epidemiological findings are useful for any preventive intervention to control disease diffusion."
8417,0.01,10.0,"HIV-positive refugees confront a variety of challenges in accessing and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and attaining durable viral suppression; however, there is little understanding of what these challenges are, how they are navigated, or how they may differ across humanitarian settings. We sought to document and examine accounts of the threats, barriers and facilitators experienced in relation to HIV treatment and care and to conduct comparisons across settings. We conducted semi-structured interviews among a purposive sample of 14 refugees attending a public, urban HIV clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (July-September 2010), and 12 refugees attending a camp-based HIV clinic in Kakuma, Kenya (February-March 2011). We used framework methods and between-case comparison to analyze and interpret the data, identifying social and environmental factors that influenced adherence. The multiple issues that threatened adherence to antiretroviral therapy or precipitated actual adherence lapses clustered into three themes: ""migration"", ""insecurity"", and ""resilience"". The migration theme included issues related to crossing borders and integrating into treatment systems upon arrival in a host country. Challenges related to crossing borders were reported in both settings, but threats pertaining to integration into, and navigation of, a new health system were exclusive to the Malaysian setting. The insecurity theme included food insecurity, which was most commonly reported in the Kenyan setting; health systems insecurity, reported in both settings; and emotional insecurity, which was most common in the Kenyan setting. Resilient processes were reported in both settings. We drew on the concept of ""bounded agency"" to argue that, despite evidence of personal and community resilience, these processes were sometimes insufficient for overcoming social and environmental barriers to adherence. In general, interventions might aim to bolster individuals' range of action with targeted support that bolsters resilient processes. Specific interventions are needed to address locally-based food and health system insecurities. "
6073,0.01,10.0,"Immune mechanisms that may control Cryptosporidium parvum infection remain unknown. The role of T cell-mediated immunity is suggested by the chronic disease observed in AIDS patients and in athymic or CD4+ T cell-depleted mice. The role of specific antibodies is also unclear. This study sought to determine serum and secretory antibodies to C. parvum in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with or without chronic cryptosporidiosis. C. parvum-specific antibodies and specific secretory antibodies were determined by ELISA in saliva and sera from 50 HIV-1-infected patients, 27 healthy adults, and 21 healthy children. Despite lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts, patients with chronic cryptosporidiosis had increased levels of C. parvum-specific antibodies in saliva and serum and higher specific secretory antibody levels in saliva than did controls. Persistence of protracted diarrhea despite high levels of both serum and secretory antibodies suggests that specific secretory antibodies are not sufficient to control this protozoan parasite infection of intestinal mucosa."
1917,0.01,10.0,"HIV-seropositive, active injection-drug users (IDUs), compared with other HIV populations, continue to have low rates of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use, contributing to disparities in their HIV health outcomes. We sought to identify individual-level, interpersonal, and structural factors associated with HAART use among active IDUs to inform comprehensive, contextually tailored intervention to improve the HAART use of IDUs. Prospective data from three semiannual assessments were combined, and logistic general estimating equations were used to identify variables associated with taking HAART 6 months later. Participants were a community sample of HIV-seropositive, active IDUs enrolled in the INSPIRE study, a U.S. multisite (Baltimore, Miami, New York, San Francisco) prevention intervention. The analytic sample included 1,225 observations, and comprised 62% males, 75% active drug users, 75% non-Hispanic blacks, and 55% with a CD4 count <350; 48% reported HAART use. Adjusted analyses indicated that the later HAART use of IDUs was independently predicted by patient-provider engagement, stable housing, medical coverage, and more HIV primary care visits. Significant individual factors included not currently using drugs and a positive attitude about HAART benefits even if using illicit drugs. Those who reported patient-centered interactions with their HIV primary care provider had a 45% greater odds of later HAART use, and those with stable housing had twofold greater odds. These findings suggest that interventions to improve the HIV treatment of IDUs and to reduce their HIV health disparities should be comprehensive, promoting better patient-provider engagement, stable housing, HAART education with regard to illicit drug use, and integration of drug-abuse treatment with HIV primary care."
3712,0.009,9.0,"We describe five compliant patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated tuberculosis (TB) that relapsed, with acquisition of resistance by the original Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Both the first and second isolates from each patient had the same IS (insertion sequence) 6110-based DNA fingerprint patterns. Three of the five patients developed TB that was resistant to rifampin alone; no mutation in the region of the rpoB gene was detected by a line probe assay in two of the isolates from these patients. We discuss several factors presumably associated with acquired drug resistance in HIV-infected patients, including exogenous reinfection, drug interactions, malabsorption of drugs, and the presence of a large organism burden."
2991,0.009,9.0,"HIV-related stigma remains a persistent global health concern among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWA) in developing nations. The literature is lacking in studies about healthcare students' perceptions of PLWA. This study is the first effort to understand stigmatizing attitudes toward HIV-positive patients by healthcare students in Mwanza, Tanzania, not just those who will be directly treating patients but also those who will be indirectly involved through nonclinical roles, such as handling patient specimens and private health information. A total of 208 students were drawn from Clinical Medicine, Laboratory Sciences, Health Records and Information Management, and Community Health classes at the Tandabui Institute of Health Sciences and Technology for a voluntary survey that assessed stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. Students generally obtained high scores on the overall survey instrument, pointing to low stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA and an overall willingness to treat PLWA with the same standard of care as other patients. However, there are gaps in knowledge that exist among students, such as a comprehensive understanding of all routes of HIV infection. The study also suggests that students who interact with patients as part of their training are less likely to exhibit stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. A comprehensive course in HIV infection, one that includes classroom sessions focused on the epidemiology and routes of transmission as well as clinical opportunities to directly interact with PLWA-perhaps through teaching sessions led by PLWA-may allow for significant reductions in stigma toward such patients and improve clinical outcomes for PLWA around the world."
6581,0.009,9.0,"Vitamin D regulates bone metabolism but has also immunoregulatory properties. In HIV-infected patients bone disorders are increasingly observed. Furthermore, low 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) levels have been associated with low CD4(+) counts, immunological hyperactivity, and AIDS progression rates. Few studies have examined the vitamin D status in HIV-infected patients. This study will specifically focus on the effects of antiretroviral agents on vitamin D status. Furthermore, the effect of vitamin D status on CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART will be evaluated. Among 252 included patients the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<35 nmol/liter from April to September and <25 nmol/liter from October to March) was 29%. Female sex, younger age, dark skin, and NNRTI treatment were significant risk factors in univariate analysis, although in multivariate analyses skin pigmentation remained the only independent risk factor. Median 25(OH)D(3) levels were significantly lower in white NNRTI-treated patients [54.5(27.9-73.8) nmol/liter] compared to white PI-treated patients [77.3 (46.6-100.0) nmol/liter, p = 0.007], while among nonwhites no difference was observed. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients had significantly higher blood PTH levels than patients without treatment. Moreover, NNRTI treatment puts patients at risk of elevated PTH levels (>6.5 pmol/liter). Linear regression analysis showed that vitamin D status did not affect CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART. In conclusion, 29% of the HIV-1-infected patients had vitamin D deficiency, with skin color as an independent risk factor. NNRTI treatment may add more risk for vitamin D deficiency. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients showed higher PTH levels and might therefore be at risk of bone problems. Evaluation of 25(OH)D(3) and PTH levels, especially in NNRTI-treated and dark skinned HIV-1-infected patients, is necessary to detect and treat vitamin D deficiency early."
9347,0.009,9.0,"Type and prevalence of zidovudine (ZDV) resistance mutations in HIV-1-infected children in clinically stable condition and on ZDV monotherapy were analyzed to evaluate the effect of switching to didanosine (ddI) monotherapy or to ZDV plus ddI on the pattern of mutations and on the clinical outcome. Monthly clinical and laboratory controls for HIV-1 infection status were performed; at enrollment and every 4 to 6 months after treatment randomization mutant proviral sequences were evaluated in all the children, whereas viral burden was performed only in a small subgroup of patients randomly selected in each of the three treatment groups. ZDV resistance-associated proviral DNA mutations were defined as low-level resistance (LLR) mutations or medium/high-level resistance (MHLR) mutations; clinical outcome was considered as stable or deteriorating. Results showed that at entry into the study the duration of ZDV therapy was significantly correlated with the presence of mutations, and that the level of resistance given by mutations was associated with the severity both of symptoms and immunodeficiency. After randomization to treatment, in patients with mutations that confer LLR a better clinical outcome with ddI monotherapy than with ZDV plus ddI and ZDV alone was observed in the subsequent 6 months, whereas in patients with mutations that confer MHLR no significant difference among the three treatment groups was found. Data showed also that levels of viral burden at the time of changing therapy are related to clinical outcome if measured by plasma viral load. These results suggest that genotypic resistance assays, together with viral load, may prove useful for rational treatment decisions both at the start of therapy and with failure."
1796,0.009,9.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has emerged as a sexually transmitted infection among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income countries. Little is reported about HCV awareness among MSM, although this is essential for developing targeted prevention strategies. We, therefore, studied HCV awareness and knowledge among HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS). During two visits, 1 year apart and starting in October 2007, MSM from the ACS answered questions regarding HCV awareness, knowledge of HCV transmission (7 items), complications (8 items) and sexual risk behaviour. We examined the percentage of HCV awareness and correctly answered knowledge items, and whether awareness and knowledge improved significantly over time. Using logistic regression, we studied whether HIV status and sexual risk behaviour were associated with awareness. Seventy percent (312/444) of HIV-negative and 80% (74/92) of HIV-positive MSM reported to have ever heard of HCV on the first visit. Overall, awareness increased with 9% between the first and second visit (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis the association of group sex with HCV awareness was borderline significant (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.97-2.30). Compared with knowledge of transmission routes, knowledge of complications appeared to be limited. In the ACS, awareness of HCV is high, particularly among those reporting group sex, an important risk factor for HCV transmission. The majority of participants had good knowledge of transmission routes, but limited knowledge of complications of chronic HCV infection. HCV prevention messages could be strengthened, therefore, by further addressing the complications of HCV infection. "
8772,0.009,9.0,"Individuals with serious mental illness are at higher risk for HIV than are members of the general population. Although studies have shown that individuals with serious mental illness experience less adequate care and worse physical health outcomes than comparable patients without serious mental illness, little is known about HIV care among individuals with serious mental illness who become infected with HIV. In the present study, we describe patterns of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) use and physician monitoring received by 154 patients with serious mental illness infected with HIV. Participants were recruited from mental health agencies in Los Angeles, California. Data from 762 HIV-only patients from a separate Western U.S. probability sample were used for comparison. High proportions of serious mental illness patients with HIV in our sample appeared to be receiving adequate HIV care. Fifty-one percent of all serious mental illness patients with serious mental illness with HIV were taking HAART, and the majority received close monitoring of their CD4 counts (84%) and viral loads (82%) throughout a 1-year period. HAART use and patterns of CD4 count and viral load monitoring did not differ significantly between patients with both serious mental illness and HIV, and patients with HIV only (all p > 0.05). Specialized programs providing assistance to serious mental illness populations with HIV may be helping to narrow health care disparities as a result of having serious mental illness."
5966,0.009,9.0,"Reports of in vitro resistance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to zidovudine (AZT) have raised concerns about the development of resistance to other dideoxynucleosides in clinical use. To address this, we have developed a screening assay which supports the growth of clinical isolates and have applied this to a series of paired isolates from patients entered into a phase I trial of didanosine (DDI). Thirteen patients (10 with AIDS, 3 with AIDS-related complex) who had been exposed to AZT for a mean of 6.5 months (range, 1 to 13 months) were treated with DDI at 750 mg/day. Paired isolates were obtained pretherapy and after a mean of 58 weeks (range, 21 to 90) of DDI therapy by coculture of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBLs) with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs. Isolates were passaged only one additional time in PBLs and then tested in parallel in a microtiter assay with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs as targets. PBLs were infected with 10(5) 50% tissue culture infectious doses per 10(7) cells and exposed to DDI (1 to 50 microM) or AZT (0.01 to 100 microM), and supernatants were assayed for the HIV p24 antigen at 7 days postinfection. Control AZT-susceptible and resistant isolates were included. The median pre- and posttherapy DDI susceptibilities of the 13 pairs of isolates were 10.0 microM (range, 1 to 25 microM) and 17.5 microM (range, 2.5 to 50 microM), respectively (P = 0.036; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These studies thus indicated that (i) the susceptibility to DDI tends to mildly decrease with drug exposure; (ii) the susceptibility to AZT improves with time off AZT; (iii) baseline susceptibilities to DDI have a wide range, and the CD4 response may correlate with the initial susceptibility; and (iv) a PBL-based microtiter assay is useful for screening clinical isolated for dideoxynucleoside susceptibility profiles."
8959,0.009,9.0,"Transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne viruses in hospitals is discussed, and the infection control system and worker protection and education plan at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) are described. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic has led to increased concern about occupationally acquired infections in health-care workers. As the number of HIV-infected persons increases, so does the risk of infection. Occupationally acquired HIV infection of health-care workers occurs principally in nurses, phlebotomists, and laboratory technicians through accidental subcutaneous injection of contaminated blood; splashing of blood onto open skin lesions, the eyes, and mucous membranes represents another route of exposure. The risk of infection from a single needle-stick exposure to HIV-infected blood is about 0.4%. Other blood-borne viruses to which employees are vulnerable include hepatitis B virus and human T-cell lymphotropic viruses, which may cause leukemia and lymphoma. SFGH has a comprehensive infection control system. Specimen containers are enclosed in transparent secondary containers, the worker is encouraged to wear protective clothing when necessary, and specific needle-stick precautions are promoted. There is also a health-care worker protection and education plan. The employee health services department provides immunizations, keeps records on accidental exposures, and operates a hot line. The education committee disseminates educational materials and arranges lectures. Infection control and education provide simple but effective measures for protecting hospital employees against HIV and other occupationally acquired infections."
4831,0.009,9.0,"To better understand whether potent antiretroviral therapies can modify the natural history of HIV-1-associated microsporidiosis and cryptosporidiosis, the response to antimicrobial treatment of these opportunistic infections was evaluated in patients with or without antiretroviral treatment. Fifty patients with diarrhoea, all positive for Cryptosporidium parvum or Enterocytozoon bieneusi, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected concerning demographics, clinical and microbiological characteristics of the parasitic infection, antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Faecal samples were prepared using the Richie formalin-ethyl acetate method and stained using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for detection of Cryptosporidium parvum and Isospora belli, the modified trichrome and calcofluor white technique for detection of Enterocytozoon spp., and iodine for detection of ova, cysts or vegetative forms. Diarrhoea was defined as an abnormal increase in stool liquidity, an abnormal increase in stool frequency and a daily stool weight of more than 250 g for a period of at least 4 days. Patients treated with double antiretroviral therapy or protease inhibitors demonstrated an excellent response and a sustained therapeutic effect after follow-up (range, 5-36 months). The relapse of cryptosporidiosis in two patients who discontinued antiretroviral therapy suggests that the infection might remain in a latent stage. The resolution of the diarrhoea seems to be related to an increased CD4+ cell count rather than to the viral load. In conclusion, these data strongly support the hypothesis that combination antiretroviral therapy is able to greatly modify the course of cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis in patients infected with HIV-1."
4481,0.009,9.0,"Public safety and the right of the health care worker to practise without prejudice based on underlying illness may be at odds for those affected by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Nevertheless, HBV does not preclude entry into a health care profession, and the risk of transmission from health care worker to patient is not uniform across the spectrum of health care fields. In the present article, the authors present an overview of the literature regarding transmission of HBV from the health care worker to the patient, and the current recommendations that vary from province to province within Canada. The establishment of national guidelines to standardize monitoring of HBV infection among health care workers would improve health care workplace safety and patient care."
3945,0.008,8.0,"The State of Amazonas in the Brazilian Amazon region is an area of high prevalence of hepatitis B and D virus (HBV and HDV) infection. The aim of this study was to identify epidemiological patterns and risk factors of HBV and HDV infections in Barcelos, in the basin of the Negro river. A random sample (798 in all) of the total population in the urban area and in 2 rural villages was surveyed. A standardized questionnaire was used and blood samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: 1.63% had hepatitis B surface antigen, 12.9% had anti-hepatitis B surface antibody and 21.4% had anti-hepatitis B core antigen. The overall prevalence of HBV infection was 24.6%. Anti-hepatitis D was present in 5 subjects, all of them non-natives, and hepatitis B e antigen in 2. A positive association between history of dental treatment with an unqualified dental surgeon was found (P < 0.05). These results suggest a low prevalence of HVB and HDV infection, in contrast with other parts of the Amazon area."
80,0.008,8.0,"We estimated prevalence and incidence of liver condition outcomes, and costs to the health service of diagnosed hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Tayside, UK. HBV patients were identified from electronic virology data between 1989 and 2003. The health resource costs of HBV for surface antigen-positive (HBsAg+) patients and HBV (HBsAg+ or immune, i.e. recovered) patients were calculated. A total of 633 patients had HBV (275 HBsAg+), and were more likely to be male (62% vs. 48%), older (mean age 42.6 vs. 39 . 2 years) and deprived than the general population. The prevalence of immune individuals increased steadily. Post-HBV diagnosis, 24% of immune and 13% of HBsAg+ patients were diagnosed with a liver condition. The median cost per immune patient (£3023) was greater than per HBsAg+ patient (£1498) (P=0.02). While increasing prevalence of immune HBV patients highlights an increase in screening and treatment, the costs associated with this group are high."
7773,0.008,8.0,"Fever of unknown origin (FUO) poses a major diagnostic challenge in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this retrospective study, we sought to assess the clinical utility of percutaneous liver biopsy as a diagnostic aid for FUO in HIV-infected patients and identify the factors associated with a greater likelihood of a positive diagnostic yield form this procedure. A total of 101 HIV-infected patients with FUO, who had undergone percutaneous liver biopsy in an HIV care hospital, served as the study population. The results obtained from percutaneous liver biopsy were categorized into three groups: (i) diagnostic, (ii) helpful, and (iii) not helpful. Diagnostic and helpful results were classified as useful. The mean (SD) age of patients was 37.6 (6.9) years, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) CD4 count was 18 (3-62) cells/mm(3). The median (IQR) duration of fever was 20 (8-30) days. Percutaneous liver biopsy was diagnostic in 51 patients (50.5%), helpful in 12 (11.9%) and not helpful in 38 (37.6%) patients. On multivariate analyses, elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase level (OR 1.27 per one time elevation from the upper normal range; 95% CI, 1.03-1.57; P = 0.023), and fever duration of less than 3 weeks (OR 3.82; 95% CI, 1.03-14.18; P = 0.046) was significantly associated with the likelihood of the biopsy findings being classified as useful. Our study supports the case for percutaneous liver biopsy as a useful diagnostic aid in HIV-infected patients with FUO. "
4890,0.008,8.0,"There is limited information available about the prevalence and pattern of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance mutations (DRMs) among antiretroviral therapy (ART) experienced patients from northern India. Results of genotypic drug resistance testing were obtained from plasma samples of 128 patients, who had presented with clinical or immunological failure to treatment after at least six months of ART. Major DRMs associated with any of the three classes of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI), were seen in 120 out of 128 patients (93.8% prevalence). NRTI and NNRTI DRMs were each seen in 115/128 (89.8%) patients, with M184V, M41L, D67N and T215Y being the most frequent among NRTI associated mutations, and K103N, G190A, Y181C and A98G among NNRTI associated ones. PI DRMs were observed in 14/128 (10.9%) patients, with L10I, V82A and L89V being the commonest. These results present a high prevalence of DRMs among ART experienced patients from northern India with clinical or immunological failure of therapy. It emphasizes the need for regular testing of plasma samples of such patients for DRMs in order to detect and replace a failing regimen early, and also the use of HIV drug resistance genotyping of ART naive individuals prior to initiating first line ART for possible transmitted resistance. It is very important to enhance the access of patients to ARV drugs so that their compliance could be improved and hence development of DRMs be minimized."
2104,0.008,8.0,"Barriers to retention in HIV care are detrimental to patients' progress along the HIV continuum of care. Previous literature has focused on individual, client-level barriers, and interventions to address them. In contrast, less work has examined the role of system-level barriers on HIV care outcomes. This study seeks to understand how individual and systemic barriers individually are associated with clinic appointment attendance and virologic suppression in HIV-infected patients attending the largest HIV clinic in Miami-Dade, FL. In addition, we examined the synergistic effects of these barriers as potential syndemic factors on these health outcomes. Barriers to clinic attendance were determined in a face-to-face study interview with 444 HIV-infected outpatients (187 regular attenders, 191 irregular attenders, and 66 nonattenders) identified from electronic medical records. Compared with the other attendance groups, nonattenders had higher viral loads, were less likely to be virologically suppressed, had lower CD4 counts, had higher depressive symptoms, life chaos, lower quality of life, and higher rates of food insecurity, and recent drug use. Additionally, nonattenders compared with regular attenders had lower physician relationship ratings, had lower medical information clarity and more often reported transportation as a barrier to clinic attendance. When viewed as a syndemic, compared with patients not reporting any barriers, patients with 3 or more individual-level barriers were more likely to have a detectable viral load (odds ratio = 3.60, 95% CI: 1.71 to 7.61). Our findings suggest that patients presenting to the clinic with multiple barriers should be prioritized for assistance and future interventions to improve retention in care. Interventions should address multiple individual and system-level barriers simultaneously with particular attention to addressing depressive symptoms, organizational skills, relationship with the physician, and HIV-related health education.

609,0.008,8.0,"Cryptosporidium spp. and Cystoisospora belli are monoxenic protozoa that have been recognized as the causative agents of chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals, especially HIV-infected subjects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of these intestinal protozoa in HIV-positive patients in the Triângulo Mineiro region of Brazil and to correlate the presence of these infections with clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data of the patients. Oocysts were detected in stool samples of 10 (16.9%) of the 59 patients studied, while Cryptosporidium spp. were present in 10.1% (6/59) and C. belli in 6.7% (4/59). The frequency of these parasites was higher among patients with diarrheic syndrome and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts < 200 cells/mm 3 , demonstrating the opportunistic characteristic of these infections. A significant association was observed between the lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy and the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and/or C. belli. Parasitism with Cryptosporidium spp. was more frequent in February and April, the months following the period of high rainfall. The same was not observed for C. belli. Genetic characterization of two isolates led to the identification of Cryptosporidium parvum, one of the main species associated with the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis."
3108,0.008,8.0,"The study investigated the impact of xerostomia on oral health and quality of life (QoL) among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who were attending for routine HIV monitoring in Australia. This cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey and oral screening (OS) included 100 subjects who were HIV positive. The OS was conducted by a dentist blinded to the subject's survey responses. Xerostomia was determined by asking the subjects a single question. Subjects with xerostomia were found to have increased caries activity and poorer QoL, especially in the psychological dimensions of the oral health impact profile. Age and duration of HIV infection were associated with xerostomia. Early diagnosis of xerostomia and intervention with preventive dental care would potentially reduce caries and improve QoL among patients infected with HIV-1. Ongoing chronic inflammation of salivary glands despite the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapy may play a role in the etiology of xerostomia in patients infected with HIV and requires further study."
2503,0.008,8.0,"Many oral lesions are strongly associated with HIV infection. Along with the HIV-infected individual's T helper cell count (CD4 + cell count), they indicate the severity of immune suppression. It is important for dental professionals to recognize these lesions early, as it alerts patients to their HIV status, and allows them to receive appropriate and prompt treatment for their HIV infection and related oral conditions. An atlas of the oral lesions commonly associated with HIV infection is presented. To update dental providers and assist them in the recognition and diagnosis of these conditions, the recent criteria for diagnosis suggested by the European Economic Community (EEC) Clearinghouse on Oral Problems Related to HIV Infection and the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre on Oral Manifestations of the Immunodeficiency virus are also presented."
7469,0.008,8.0,"Molecular mechanisms related to occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, particularly those based on genotype C infection, have rarely been determined thus far in the ongoing efforts to determine infection mechanisms. Therefore, we aim to elucidate the mutation patterns in the surface open reading frame (S ORF) underlying occult infections of HBV genotype C in the present study. Nested PCRs were applied to 624 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative Korean subjects. Cloning and sequencing of the S ORF gene was applied to 41 occult cases and 40 control chronic carriers. Forty-one (6.6%) of the 624 Korean adults with HBsAg-negative serostatus were found to be positive for DNA according to nested PCR tests. Mutation frequencies in the three regions labeled here as preS1, preS2, and S were significantly higher in the occult subjects compared to the carriers in all cases. A total of two types of deletions, preS1 deletions in the start codon and preS2 deletions as well as nine types of point mutations were significantly implicated in the occult infection cases. Mutations within the ""a"" determinant region in HBsAg were found more frequently in the occult subjects than in the carriers. Mutations leading to premature termination of S ORF were found in 16 occult subjects (39.0%) but only in one subject from among the carriers (2.5%). In conclusion, our data suggest that preS deletions, the premature termination of S ORF, and ""a"" determinant mutations are associated with occult infections of HBV genotype C among a HBsAg-negative population. The novel mutation patterns related to occult infection introduced in the present study can help to broaden our understanding of HBV occult infections."
6893,0.008,8.0,"Lamivudine is a major drug approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Emergence of drug-resistant mutants with amino acid substitutions in the YMDD motif is a well-documented problem during long-term lamivudine therapy. Here we report a novel lamivudine-resistant strain of HBV with an intact YMDD motif, which included an amino acid substitution, rtA181T, in the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of HBV polymerase. The substitution also induced a unique amino acid substitution (W172L) in the overlapping hepatitis B surface (HBs) protein. The YMDD mutant strains were not detected even by using the sensitive peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR clamping method. The detected nucleotide substitution was accompanied by the emergence of an additional nucleotide substitution that induced amino acid change (S331C) in the spacer domain. The rtA181T mutant strain displayed a threefold decrease in susceptibility to lamivudine in in vitro experiments in comparison with the wild type. In vivo analysis using human hepatocyte-chimeric mice confirmed the resistance of this mutant strain to lamivudine. We developed a method to detect this novel rtA181T mutation and a previously reported rtA181T mutation with the HBs stop codon using restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR and identified one patient with the latter pattern among 40 patients with lamivudine resistance. In conclusion, although the incidence is not high, we have to be careful regarding the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutant strains with intact YMDD motif."
6426,0.008,8.0,"Europe is currently observing a significant rise in non-B subtypes. Consequently, the effect of genetic variability on therapy response or genotypic resistance interpretation algorithms is an emerging concern. The purpose of this study is to investigate the amino acid substitutions selected under drug pressure in the protease of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes B and G, and determine if there are any significant differences. We investigated therapy-related and subtype-related substitutions in the protease, considering subtype, overall protease inhibitor treatment and individual drug exposure. Many mutations were significantly related to protease inhibitor (PI) therapy, with mutations exclusive to subtype B or subtype G. Some mutations are at positions related to resistance in both subtypes, but the amino acid substitution is different. Other mutations were significantly associated with subtype and PI selective pressure (p<0.05), pointing towards a differential selective pressure in both subtypes. We confirmed previous reports on the subtype-dependent selection of D30N and 89I, and identified a new mutation with such differential selective pressure: 37D was preferentially selected by lopinavir in subtype B. Other novel mutations found under therapy pressure were 13A, 35N, K55R, I66F, I72L/T, T74S, 82M and 89I/V. Our study indicates that even though in general, drug selective pressure and resistance pathways are relatively similar between subtypes B and G, some differences do occur, leading to subtype-dependent substitutions."
2231,0.008,8.0,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been associated with increased rates of single- and multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis in the New York City area. In order to examine the relationship of HIV infection to drug-resistant tuberculosis in other selected regions of the United States, we established a registry of cases of culture-proven tuberculosis. Data were collected from sites participating in an NIH-funded, community-based HIV clinical trials group. All cases of tuberculosis, regardless of HIV status, which occurred between January 1992 and June 1994 were recorded. Overall, 1,373 cases of tuberculosis were evaluated, including 425 from the New York City area, and 948 from seven other metropolitan areas. The overall prevalence of resistance to one or more drugs was 20.4%, and 5.6% of isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (MDR). In the New York City area, HIV-infected patients were significantly more likely than persons not known to be HIV-infected, to have resistance to at least one drug (37% versus 19%) and MDR (19% versus 6%). In other geographic areas, overall drug resistance was 16%, and only 2.2% of isolates were MDR. In multiple logistic regression analyses, HIV infection was shown to be a risk factor for drug-resistant tuberculosis, independent of geographic location, history of prior therapy, age, and race. We concluded that HIV infection is associated with increased rates of resistance to antituberculosis drugs in both the New York City area and other geographic areas. MDR tuberculosis is occurring predominantly in the New York City area and is highly correlated with HIV infection."
9760,0.008,8.0,"The prevalence of serum markers of delta hepatitis was determined prospectively in 82 intravenous drug abusers at various stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Seventeen were HIV negative, 30 were HIV positive without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 35 had been diagnosed as having AIDS. Antihepatitis D virus (HDV) in serum was measured by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and also by solid phase capture radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HDV. HDV antigen and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA were also measured. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBs were determined by using a commercially available RIA. Anti-HDV (RIA) was only detected in serum that contained HBsAg. These anti-HDV (RIA) positive samples also tested positive with the commercial anti-HDV electroimmunoassay. In addition, the commercial anti-HDV ELISA detected anti-HDV in some serum samples that were negative for HBsAg; these anti HDV-positive HBsAg-negative samples were frequently lipemic or contained rheumatoid factor. The prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBs did not differ significantly with the stage of HIV disease. HBsAg was detected in 3 of 13 (23%) HIV-negative, 5 of 29 (17%) HIV-positive, and 4 of 18 (22%) patients with AIDS. IgG and IgM anti-HDV (RIA) was positive in 2 of 3 HIV-negative and 4 of 5 HIV-positive pre-AIDS HBsAg-positive subjects. However, none of 4 AIDS patients had anti-HDV. The difference between AIDS and non-AIDS patients was statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.03). HDV antigen was detected in serum from one AIDS patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The aim of the present study was to investigate hepatitis B (HB) knowledge and vaccination acceptance among health care personnel in southwestern Greece, using the Hepatitis B Vaccine Knowledge and Acceptance Questionnaire. One hundred eighty-three employees participated (71 males). Occupation (p < .001), higher education (p < .001), and vaccination (p = .007) were significantly related to HB knowledge. The rate of HBV vaccination coverage was 70.9%. Participants considering themselves at high risk for HBV infection did not report significantly increased vaccination rates. In the multivariate analysis, university personnel (p = .002), occupational category (p < .001), and HB knowledge (p = .049) were significantly associated with vaccination. In conclusion, 29% of hospital personnel were not vaccinated mainly due to negligence. Occupation, education, and knowledge about HB seem to be associated with HBV vaccination."
5629,0.008,8.0,"Treatment with antiretroviral agents (ARVs) during pregnancy is important to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but their use has been associated with low bone mineral density in adult patients. Currently, there are no data regarding the bone status of HIV-infected women who received ARV during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to evaluate cortical bone status at delivery in a group of HIV-infected women who received ARV during pregnancy and to monitor the changes occurring during the first year postpartum. We studied 33 HIV-infected and 116 HIV-uninfected healthy Caucasian women within 4 days from delivery. Follow-up measurements were performed at 4 and 12 months postpartum in 17 HIV-infected and 55 healthy women. Cortical bone status was evaluated by quantitative ultrasonography at the mid-tibia, and bone measurements were expressed as the speed of sound (SOS). HIV-infected women after delivery had a median SOS of 3,985 (3,567-4,242) m/s, while the median SOS of healthy women was 4,025 (3,643-4,250) m/s. The difference was not significant (t = 0.39, P = 0.69). No significant differences were observed between ARV-exposed and control subjects at 4 and 12 months. Our data suggest that ARV during pregnancy and the first year after delivery does not affect negatively cortical bone status."

4806,0.008,8.0,"Medication adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is currently a topic of major importance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome care. HAART has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV infection. Many people with HIV now live active and productive lives, with the disease itself having minimal impact on their lifespan. Unlike treatment for other chronic diseases, achieving the full benefit of HAART requires an extremely high level of adherence to potent antiretroviral combinations that is often difficult to achieve given the high pill burdens, drug interactions and adverse events associated with treatment. In this paper, the present knowledge regarding antiretroviral medication adherence is summarized with a focus on understanding the importance of adherence, the relationship between adherence and treatment response, the challenges and barriers facing patients trying to achieve optimal adherence, reasons for nonadherence, and the current directions and issues relevant to future adherence research."
1718,0.008,8.0,"Nonadherence to combination antiretroviral (ARV) therapies (cART) is highly prevalent and significantly increases the risk of adverse human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease outcomes. The current study evaluated the hypothesis that prospective memory-a dissociable aspect of episodic memory describing the ability to execute a future intention-plays an important role in successful cART adherence. Seventy-nine individuals with HIV infection who were prescribed at least one ARV medication underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuromedical evaluation prior to completing a 1-month observation of their cART adherence as measured by electronic medication monitoring. Nonadherent individuals (n = 31) demonstrated significantly poorer prospective memory functioning as compared to adherent persons (n = 48), particularly on an index of time-based ProM (i.e., elevated loss of time errors). Deficits in time-based prospective memory were independently predictive of cART nonadherence, even after considering the possible influence of established predictors of adherence, such as general cognitive impairment (e.g., retrospective learning and memory) and psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression). These findings extend a nascent literature showing that impairment in time-based prospective memory significantly increases the risk of medication nonadherence and therefore may guide the development of novel strategies for intervention.

7643,0.008,8.0,"The objective of this study is to measure HIV/AIDS knowledge among patients with mental illness in Brazil and to examine individual and treatment setting predictors of knowledge. We conducted a cross-sectional national multicenter study among 2,475 patients in 26 randomly selected mental health institutions throughout Brazil. We used Item Response Theory to standardize knowledge scores and multilevel multiple linear regression to determine the effect of individual and treatment setting characteristics on standardized knowledge score. Schizophrenia was the main diagnosis (48%) of participants. Mean knowledge score was 6.78 (range 1-10). Treatment setting characteristics were not associated with knowledge scores. Higher HIV/AIDS knowledge scores were significantly associated with a history of sexually transmitted disease (STD), previous HIV testing and consistent condom use; lower HIV/AIDS knowledge scores were significantly associated with specific sociodemographic, psychiatric, and HIV risk-perception factors. Psychiatric patients in Brazil lag behind the general population with knowledge scores comparable to those of nearly a decade ago. The mental health system in Brazil and elsewhere must consider strategies beyond dispensing information, for preventing HIV/AIDS transmission in the psychiatric population."
2192,0.008,8.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are thought to play a major role in the immune response to HIV infection. The HIV-specific CTL response is much stronger than previously documented in an infectious disease, yet estimates of CTL frequency derived from limiting-dilution analysis (LDA) are relatively low and comparable to other viral infections. Here we show that individual CTL clones specific for peptides from HIV gag and pol gene products are present at high levels in the peripheral blood of three infected patients and that individual CTL clones may represent between 0.2% and 1% of T cells. Previous LDA in one donor had shown a frequency of CTL precursors of 1/8000, suggesting that LDA may underestimate CTL effector frequency. In some donors individual CTL clones persisted in vivo for at least 5 years. In contrast, in one patient there was a switch in CTL usage suggesting that different populations of CTLs can be recruited during infection. These data imply strong stimulation of CTLs, potentially leading some clones to exhaustion."
5669,0.008,8.0,"The demand for dental treatment by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals is rising. Some professionals are still reluctant to treat these patients, despite the extremely low likelihood of professional transmission, which increases only in patients with a very elevated viral load. The complications rate after dental intervention is very low, even in patients with considerable immunologic deterioration. The dentist should pay special attention to the general clinical situation and immunologic and HIV virologic status of the seropositive patient, and to the presence of hemostasis alterations or of other concomitant diseases. Antiretroviral or any other drug treatments must also be recorded, in order to avoid possible interactions with clinician-prescribed drugs. Tooth extraction is the most common dental treatment and requires no antibiotic therapy except in cases of neutropenia or severe immunosuppression. Other dental treatments do not require special precautions, and the complications index among these patients is similar to that among the uninfected patient population. With this background, there is a need to make the clinician-in-training aware of the importance of regular dental health checkups as part of the health care routine of HIV-infected patients and to familiarize the clinician with their management, while not disregarding the unquestionable requirement to carry out the general and specific prevention measures to be adopted in all cases."

There are few published studies concerning cryptosporidiosis and Cryptosporidium genotypes in Iranian immunocompromised patients and none of them describe risk factors. This study was undertaken to identify prevalence, genotypes and risk factors for cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised patients. Three fecal samples were obtained at two day intervals from each of the 183 patients and processed with modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining methods and 18S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. The overall infection prevalence was 6%. Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in isolates from five HIV-infected patients, one patient who had undergone bone marrow transplantation and one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cryptosporidium hominis was identified in isolates from two HIV-infected patients and two patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. According to univariate analysis, the statistically significant factors were diarrhea (OR = 21.7, CI = 2.83-78.4, P= 0.003), CD4 + lymphocytes less than 100 cells/mm(3) (OR = 41.3, CI = 13.45-114.8, P < 0.0001), other microbial infections (OR = 7.1321.7, CI = 1.97-25.73, P = 0.006), weight loss (OR = 73.78, CI = 15.5-350, P < 0.0001), abdominal pain (OR = 10.29, CI = 2.81-37.74.4, P= 0.001), dehydration (OR = 72.1, CI = 17.6-341.5, P < 0.0001), vomiting (OR = 4.87, CI = 1.4-16.9, P= 0.015), nausea (OR = 9.4, CI = 2.38-37.2, P < 0.001), highly active antiretroviral therapy (OR = 0.089, CI = 0.01-0.8, P= 0.015) and diarrhea in household members (OR = 7.37, CI = 2.04-26.66, P= 0.001). After multivariate analysis and a backward deletion process, only < 100 CD4 + T-lymphocytes/mm(3) maintained a significant association with infection. The authors recommend that this infection should be suspected in patients with diarrhea, weight loss and dehydration in general and in diarrheal individuals with < 100 CD4 + T-lymphocytes/mm(3)."
7294,0.008,8.0,"In 1989 the prevalence of hepatitis B virus markers was studied by radioimmunoassay in a sample of 1,426 healthy children, 3 to 11 years old, attending kindergarten and the primary schools in a large urban area of the Apulia Region in Southern Italy, where the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence among pregnant women is 5.6%. The overall prevalence of any hepatitis B virus marker was 3.4%, increasing from 1.7% in 3- to 5-year-old children to 5% in 10- to 11-year-old children (P less than 0.002). Prevalence was not associated with the father's years of schooling (odds ratio, 1.98; confidence interval, 95% (0.9 to 4.6] or with the family size (odds ratio, 2.96; confidence interval, (0.7 to 11.8]. The overall HBsAg prevalence was 0.8, a rate that was lower than the 5.6% found in pregnant women. The finding of only 12 HBsAg-positive children of the 1,426 tested, despite 80 of them being born to HBsAg-positive carrier mothers (on the basis of the 5.6% HBsAg prevalence among pregnant women), is probably attributable to the low proportion (5%) of hepatitis B e antigen positivity among the HBsAg-positive carrier mothers in the study area. The observed low HBV infection rate in younger age groups, which confirms recent studies in other areas of Italy, appears to be the result of several factors: improved socioeconomic conditions; decreased family size; and increased use of disposable syringes in the last few years."
6727,0.008,8.0,"In the battle against acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), focusing treatment on early intervention of its underlying condition, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, may help reduce the disability associated with AIDS. A comprehensive care hospital unit featuring physicians with expertise in HIV treatment, clinical research activities, and home health services may offer the most effective care for HIV patients. The preventive nature of comprehensive care also can reduce costs through decreased hospitalization, integrated hospital revenue centers, patients' minimized lost work time, and reduction of medical disability."
1150,0.008,8.0,"Substantial changes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related sexual behavior have been reported by virtually every survey of homosexual/bisexual men in the last decade. This paper uses a behavior-based simulation to examine how such changes are likely to affect the long-term future of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic among homosexual men. Data from the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project in New York City are used to estimate age-specific patterns of unprotected anogenital contact and behavioral change from 1980 to 1991. Model projections are validated using New York City surveillance data on AIDS incidence from 1981 to 1991. The current levels of unsafe sex reported in the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project are shown to be almost exactly on the epidemic threshold. If this behavior were maintained, HIV prevalence would slowly decline in the population, but with just one additional unsafe sexual partner per year HIV would instead become endemic, with seroprevalence of about 65% in the oldest group and about 25% in the youngest. Transmission dynamics in the youngest group are analyzed in detail. For this group, the assortative age-matching bias in partner selection patterns raises the unsafe behavior threshold slightly in the long run."
9717,0.008,8.0,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can improve immune system function through suppression of HIV-1 replication. However, paradoxical immune response may develop in some patients as a result of effective therapy followed by immune restoration. The phenomena is known as IRS, immune reconstitution syndrome/immune recovery syndrome. IRS can develop within weeks to months after cART is commenced and the time is related to the type of the disease. There are but scant reports concerning IRS-NHL (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) in HIV-1 positive subjects. We observed 4 (33%) cases of IRS-NHL out of 12 patients in whom NHL was diagnosed. As a result of potent cART they reached viral suppression in a mean time of 15 weeks followed by a rise in CD4(+) T cells within 16.5 weeks. The diagnosis of NHL was established at a mean time of 36 weeks after cART was introduced and 20 weeks after the CD4 T cell increase was achieved. This may indicate that the immune reconstitution as a result of cART was a predisposing factor for the development of NHL in our patients. There was prompt progression of the disease and the outcome was fatal in all cases. IRS-NHL should be suspected in any case of lymphadenopathy, generalized or limited to the abdomen or periphery, which develops after immune recovery due to potent cART within a few months."
7248,0.008,8.0,"A cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-discordant couples was established to evaluate risk factors associated with heterosexual viral transmission. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to document the HIV-uninfected status among members of discordant heterosexual couples and to rule out immunosilent infection. HIV DNA PCR specific for a gag gene region was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 203 HIV antibody-negative adults who have long-term heterosexual relationships with HIV-infected partners. The results were negative for 200 but consistently positive in three individuals. More extensive evaluation of these three individuals with an additional primer pair specific for the envelope gene, quantitative DNA PCR, multiple additional time points, and variable nucleotide tandem repeat analyses revealed specimen processing problems in two cases but an apparent true positive PCR assay in the third case. This subject remains antibody and PCR negative for a 32-month follow-up period. These results confirm previous studies that document a negligible incidence of occult HIV infection as delineated by PCR in antibody negative heterosexual partners of HIV-infected individuals. Specimen processing errors occur at a low rate (1% in this study) and require careful evaluation. The possibility of transient, aborted infection versus successful infection with a long immunosilent period was observed in a single individual. Definitive resolution of infection status will require long-term evaluation."
2394,0.008,8.0,"Food insecurity is increasingly reported as an important barrier of patient adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in both resource-poor and rich settings. However, unlike in resource rich-settings, very few quantitative studies to date have investigated the association of food insecurity with patient adherence to ART in Sub-Saharan Africa. The current study examines the association between food insecurity and adherence to ART among HIV-infected adults in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)."
952,0.008,8.0,"Studies were conducted to determine if there is a mechanistic basis for reports of suboptimal virologic responses and concerns regarding the safety of regimens containing the combination of tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and didanosine (ddI) by assessing the pharmacokinetic consequences of coadministration of these drugs on intracellular nucleotides. This was a prospective and longitudinal study in HIV-1-infected patients of adding either TDF or ddI to a stable antiretroviral regimen containing the other drug. Intracellular concentrations of the nucleotide analogs TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP) and ddATP and the endogenous purine nucleotides dATP and 2'-dGTP in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured. A total of 16 patients were enrolled into the two study arms and a study extension. Intracellular TFV-DP concentrations (median, 120 fmol/10(6) cells) and ddATP concentrations (range, 1.50 to 7.54 fmol/10(6) cells in two patients) were unaffected following addition of ddI or TDF to a stable regimen containing the other drug. While coadministration of ddI and TDF for 4 weeks did not appear to impact dATP or dGTP concentrations, cross-sectional analysis suggested that extended therapy with ddI-containing regimens, irrespective of TDF coadministration, may decrease dATP and ddATP concentrations. Addition of TDF or ddI to a stable regimen including the other drug, in the context of ddI dose reduction, did not adversely affect the concentration of dATP, dGTP, TFV-DP, or ddATP. The association between longer-term ddI therapy and reduced intracellular nucleotide concentrations and this observation's implication for the efficacy and toxicity of ddI-containing regimens deserve further study."
3642,0.007,7.0,"We conducted a large-scale survey to determine the frequency and clinical significance of mutations in the pre-core region of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sera from 263 patients with chronic HBV infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified HBV DNA. Four major missense/nonsense mutations (M) were found: (M1) C-->T at nucleotide position 1856, Pro-->Ser at codon 15; (M2) G-->A at position 1896, Trp-->stop at codon 28; (M3) G-->A at position 1898, Gly-->Ser at codon 29; and (M4) G-->A at position 1899, Gly-->Asp at codon 29. The commonest conserved mutation was M0: T-->C at position 1858, Pro-->Pro at codon 15. We found that M1 and M2 were mutually exclusive, M3 was only found in association with M1, and M4 was predominantly found in association with M2. All patients with M1 but none of those with M2 had M0. The invariable coexistence of certain mutations in codon 15 and codons 28 and 29 and the mutual exclusion of other mutations in these two noncontiguous regions is related to the stem-loop structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence located in the precore/core region. M2 and M4 enhance the stability of the stem by providing two additional paired sites. M1 destroys an existing base pair. However, M1 only occurred in the presence of M0, which provides an extra paired site, and 50% of patients with M1 had M3, a compensatory mutation that restores base pairing at this site. Our data support the proposed secondary structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence. The primary function of the mutations in the pre-core region is to enhance stability of this secondary structure to ensure perpetuation of viral replication."
6234,0.007,7.0,"Despite the use of antiretroviral medications during the antenatal/perinatal period, 280 to 370 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected infants are born each year in the United States. Women who might transmit the virus to their infants are (1) those not offered antenatal testing due to perceived low risk; (2) those who are noncompliant with their antiretroviral regimen; (3) those with prophylaxis failures despite good compliance; and (4) those who present late to delivery without prenatal care. The Centers for Disease Control and prevention sponsored MIRIAD (mother-infant rapid intervention at delivery) to study rapid testing of women who present late in pregnancy and/or to labor and delivery with unknown HIV status. MIRIAD was implemented in 18 hospitals in 6 American cities. In Atlanta, GA, the 2 participating hospitals had institutional differences that created different models of implementation. Hospital 1 is large and publicly funded, practicing team nursing and utilizing laboratory-based testing. Hospital 2 is a medium-sized nonprofit, whose primary nursing model allowed for specially trained staff to do point-of-care (POC) testing. Regardless of hospital type, nursing care paradigms, or testing model, facilities interested in successfully implementing a similar protocol must formulate policies for testing, notification, and treatment as well as consider dedicating a staff member to the program."
6501,0.007,7.0,"Hepatitis B infection affects two billion people worldwide and 350 million of these are chronically infected. Chronic hepatitis B virus is one of the most important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. If it is left untreated, about one-third of affected people will develop progressive and possibly fatal liver disease, like hepatic cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, five nucleos(t)ide analogs are approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. They are: lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, telbivudine, entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In this work, we developed and validated an UPLC-Tandem mass spectrometry assay method capable of monitoring lamivudine, telbivudine, tenofovir and entecavir plasma concentrations. Both standards and quality controls (high, medium and low) were prepared in human plasma. Each sample was added with internal standard (5'amino-5'deoxy-thymidine) and then drugs were extracted through a protein precipitation protocol with acetonitrile+0.1% formic acid and then dried. The extracts were resuspended in water and then injected into the chromatographic system. The chromatographic separation was performed on an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 1.8 μm 2.1 × 150 mm column, with a gradient of water and acetonitrile, both added with formic acid (0.05%). Accuracy, intra-day and inter-day precision at quality controls levels fitted all FDA guidelines for all analytes, while matrix effects and recoveries resulted stable between samples for each analyte. Finally, we tested this method by monitoring plasma concentrations in 30 HBV+ patients with good results. This simple analytical method could represent a useful tool for the management of anti-HBV therapy."
2468,0.007,7.0,"The dental health of 94 HIV-positive patients was investigated by the sum of carious, missing and filling teeth (DMF index), plaque (Silness and Löe) and bleeding point indices (Lenox and Kopczyk). Blood parameters were evaluated, including total lymphocytes, CD4+ lymphocytes, beta-2-microglobulin, platelets, the Quick index, and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA). Patient oral parameters were contrasted with risk group (intravenous drug users homo- and heterosexuals) and controls. An evaluation was also made of differences in dental condition as a function of CD4+ cell number, according to the latest CDC classification (1992). HIV-positive intravenous drug users were found to present poorer DMF, plaque and bleeding point indices than the rest of the patients. No relationship was observed between CD4+ cell numbers in blood and dental condition, thus suggesting that the deteriorated dental health observed is a consequence of factors inherent to the risk groups involved rather than of the altered blood parameters."
1576,0.007,7.0,"Dentists in the Philippines were surveyed for evidence of past hepatitis A and B virus infections. Of the 234 dentists examined, 201 (85.9 per cent) were found to have been infected by HA virus and 137 (58.5 per cent) had been infected by HB virus. The proportion with evidence of past HB virus infection increased as the years in dental practice increased. This increment with age was not found in the general population of the Philippines. It is considered that the incremental pattern could be attributed to the summation of risk during many years of providing dental treatment. Comparing the proportion of dentists with HBV antibodies (anti-HBs/c) in the Philippines, Japan, USA and Denmark, the Philippine dentists were found to be more frequently infected than dentists in the other countries. However, the increment in the proportion positive for HBV as the years in practice advanced was consistent with that found in Japan. The prevalence of post HA virus infection in Philippine dentists was higher than the proportion for dentists in Japan but in both countries it is probable that dentists are infected at the same rate as the general population."
5770,0.007,7.0,"The first HIV-infected patients were treated in 1986, however, at that time medicines inhibiting HIV replication were not available. Solely the complications of AIDS and opportunistic infections could be treated. The HIV replication inhibition capacity of antiretroviral nucleoside and ribavirin were tested in Hungary in 1987, an early date even in international practice. The first nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), azidothymidine, presently called zidovudine (ZDV), was introduced in 1989. By giving patients the appropriate dosage of this, the progression of the disease could be delayed by approximately 6 months to one year. In 1991, the application of two new NRTI was commenced, namely zalcitabine (DDC) and didanosine (DDI). These medicines were applied partly in case of ZDV intolerance and as a part of the sequential monotherapy. In 1994 and 1995 two new NRTI's were introduce, namely stavudine (d4T) and lamivudine (3 TC). At that same time, to obtain a more effective replication inhibition method, a double NRTI combination became part of the therapeutic protocol. The year 1996 resulted in significant changes. At the beginning of the year, two compounds belonging to two new therapeutic procedures. These are saquinavir (SQV) and delavirdine (DLV) belonging to the groups of protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase, respectively. The so-called virus cocktails and the effective active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were applied and, later, to monitor the efficiency of the treatment, the opportunity was provided to measure the copy number of HIV-RNS. The treatment of the HIV disease entails a number of unanswered questions. The maximum result that can be achieved by using today's therapeutic methods is to prolong that particular phase of the HIV disease, which secures the patient a fairly good quality of life. The new combination of the antiretroviral compounds produced by the pharmaceutical industry provides better changes to prolong said period by years, sometimes decades. However, the real solutions to the problem are only theoretically known treatment procedures (gene therapy, cytokins) today."
2586,0.007,7.0,"The level of genetic variation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a member of the lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family, is high relative to that of retroviruses in some other genera. The high error rates of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in cell-free systems suggest an explanation for this high genetic variation. To test whether the in vivo rate of mutation during reverse transcription of HIV-1 is as high as predicted by cell-free studies, and therefore higher than that rates of mutation of retroviruses in other genera, we developed an in vivo assay for detecting forward mutations in HIV-1, using the lacZ alpha peptide gene as a reporter for mutations. This system allows the rates and types of mutations that occur during a single cycle of replication to be studied. We found that the forward mutation rate for HIV-1 was 3.4 x 10(-5) mutations per bp per cycle. Base substitution mutations predominated; G-to-A transition mutations were the most common base substitution. The in vivo mutation rates for HIV-1 are three and seven times higher than those previously reported for two other retroviruses, spleen necrosis virus and bovine leukemia virus, respectively. In contrast, our calculated in vivo mutation rate for HIV-1 is about 20-fold lower than the error rate of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, with the same target sequence. This finding indicates that HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo is not as error prone as predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase in cell-free studies. Our data suggest that the fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may not accurately reflect the level of genetic variation in a natural infection."
6550,0.007,7.0,Hepatitis B virus (HBV) affects people worldwide but the local burden especially in pregnant women and their new born babies is unknown. In Rwanda HIV-infected individuals who are also infected with HBV are supposed to be initiated on ART immediately. HBV is easily transmitted from mother to child during delivery. We sought to estimate the prevalence of chronic HBV infection among pregnant women attending ante-natal clinic (ANC) in Rwanda and to determine factors associated with HBV and HIV co-infection.
9794,0.007,7.0,"Viral liver diseases are frequent comorbidities and major contributors to death in HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Although cure of hepatitis C and control of hepatitis B with antivirals avert liver disease progression in most HIV-coinfected patients, the lack of satisfactory treatment for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection remains a major threat for developing cirrhosis and liver cancer in this population. In the European Union (EU) and North America, sexual contact has replaced injection drug use that has been the major transmission route for HDV in HIV-positive persons. PegIFNα is the only approved HDV therapy; however, sustained HDV-RNA clearance is achieved by less than 25%. The recent discovery of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide as the key hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV cell entry receptor has opened the door to a new therapeutic era. Indeed, promising results have been released using Myrcludex-B, a sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide inhibitor. More encouraging are data with new classes of HDV blockers, such as prenylation inhibitors (i.e. lonafarnib) and nucleic acid polymers. At this time, sustained suppression of HDV replication is the primary goal of HDV therapy, as it is associated with normalization of liver enzymes and histological improvement. Of note, the use of specific antivirals for HDV must be given along with anti-HBV agents to prevent HBV rebounds following removal of viral interference. The lack of persistent forms of HDV-RNA could provide a unique opportunity for curing hepatitis delta, even without eliminating HBV circular covalently closed DNA. Ultimately, suppression of HDV replication along with hepatitis B surface antigen clearance once drugs are off would be the best reflect of hepatitis delta cure."
9162,0.007,7.0,"We present health and demographic surveillance system data to assess associations with health care utilization and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) service receipt in a high HIV prevalence area of western Kenya. Eighty-six percent of 15,302 residents indicated a facility/clinician for routine medical services; 60% reported active (within the past year) attendance. Only 34% reported a previous HIV test, and self-reported HIV prevalence was 6%. Active attendees lived only slightly closer to their reported service site (2.8 versus 3.1 km; P < 0.001) compared with inactive attendees. Multivariate analysis showed that younger respondents (< 30 years of age) and active and inactive attendees were more likely to report an HIV test compared with non-attendees; men were less likely to report HIV testing. Despite traveling farther for HIV services (median distance = 4.4 km), 77% of those disclosing HIV infection reported HIV care enrollment. Men and younger respondents were less likely to enroll in HIV care. Socioeconomic status was not associated with HIV service use. Distance did not appear to be the major barrier to service receipt. The health and demographic surveillance system data identified patterns of service use that are useful for future program planning."
3845,0.007,7.0,"Adherence to treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with the successful eradication of infection. However, patients often have difficulty adhering to HCV treatment because of factors such as the psychiatric side effects of regimens and social disadvantage. Commonly, health professionals including specialist physicians, nurses, social workers and psychologists work together under a multidisciplinary model of shared-care to support patients' adherence to HCV treatment. In some HCV treatment clinics, shared-care is not always available, or only partially implemented and this has implications for patient adherence. To explore the facilitators of adherence, an interview-based study was conducted in 2012 with a purposive sample of Australian physicians and nurses (N = 20). The findings reveal that when comprehensive shared-care was limited or unavailable, physicians and nurses filled in the gaps by assuming roles outside of their expertise to help patients adhere to HCV treatment. Physicians and nurses applied instrumental support strategies based on psychosocial interventions, namely patient advocacy, pragmatic problem-solving, treatment engagement and emotional support. These strategies were provided by dedicated physicians and nurses to address shortfalls in multidisciplinary shared-care. Although these interventions were reported to assist adherence, there is an increased risk of complications when physicians and nurses move beyond the bounds of their disciplinary training, for example, to assess and manage patients' psychiatric side effects or advocate on their behalf for social services. Future research should measure the effectiveness of instrumental support strategies on HCV treatment adherence, and explore the costs associated with physicians and nurses providing instrumental support in the absence of comprehensive multidisciplinary shared-care."
2071,0.007,7.0,"To assess the association between support group membership, socio-demographic and HIV related factors including knowledge and attitude of illness in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs). Seventy-six participants with HIV who were on follow-up management at three non-governmental care and treatment agencies in south western, Nigeria were asked to complete a questionnaire detailing their demographic characteristics, duration of awareness of HIV status, medication status, membership of a support group, HIV-related knowledge (including number of workshops/seminars attended, reading of literature), and attitude toward their illness and treatment. Compared to those who did not belong to a support group, (34, 45%), those who did (42, 55%) were significantly more knowledgeable about HIV-related (t=4.02, p=0.00) and also reported more favorable attitudes toward the illness and its treatment (t=3.38, p=0.005). A multiple regression analysis indicated that group membership and a longer period of awareness of HIV infection contributed significantly to illness knowledge and attitudes. Age, sex, years of education, medication status, and employment status did not contribute significantly to these outcome variables. Individuals living with HIV/AIDS who belonged to a support group and had availed themselves of relevant literature were more knowledgeable and positive about their illness than those who did not belong to support groups. HIV/AIDS support group membership is an important component of psycho-social care in HIV/AIDS patients in Nigeria and should be encouraged."
5243,0.007,7.0,"In Waorani communities of the Amazon basin of Ecuador, hepatitis B (HB) surface antigen was found in 14% of asymptomatic persons. The aim of this study was to identify the Waorani population in Ecuador and obtain an epidemiologically adequate coverage of vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) among them. Between February and September 2010, three vaccination campaigns were completed as part of a collaborative activity between the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health and the community leaders in the intervention areas. In addition, in 10 of the 22 Waorani communities, during first contact, a questionnaire about risk factors for HBV infection was administered. A total of 16 Waorani communities were registered before the beginning of this intervention, but during the actual process, six additional communities were identified. In total, 1,251 community members were registered, 92.7% of which received all three doses of the vaccine. Among them, 83% of survey respondents reported having been vaccinated, but only 22% were able to show proof. Only 1% of respondents were intravenous drug users, whereas 22% had at least one tattoo. All self-identified as heterosexual, but only 32% reported using condoms during sexual intercourse. By March 2015, no new cases of HB were been reported in any of the Waorani communities. Herein, we report the importance of intersectoral collaboration to strengthen health interventions in an isolated population like the Waorani area."
3781,0.007,7.0,"Poor adherence remains a major barrier to achieving the clinical and public health benefits of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs). A systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis was conduct to evaluate how ARV adverse drug reactions may influence ARV adherence. Thirty-nine articles were identified, and 33 reported that ARV adverse drug reactions decreased adherence and six studies found no influence. Visually noticeable adverse drug reactions and psychological adverse reactions were reported as more likely to cause non-adherence compared to other adverse drug reactions. Six studies reported a range of adverse reactions associated with EFV-containing regimens contributing to decreased adherence. Informing HIV-infected individuals about ARV adverse drug reactions prior to initiation, counselling about coping mechanisms, and experiencing the effectiveness of ARVs on wellbeing may improve ARV adherence."
4564,0.007,7.0,"In HIV-infected individuals, coinfection with HBV and/or HCV is common because of shared modes of transmission. It is known that HIV accelerates progression of liver disease and results in increased morbidity and mortality associated with viral hepatitis, but it is less clear if viral hepatitis has a direct effect on HIV. Treatment of viral hepatitis improves outcomes and should be considered in all HIV-infected patients. Treatment of HBV without concurrent treatment of HIV is risky because resistance can occur in both viruses if regimens are not carefully chosen. "
7450,0.007,7.0,"The remarkable advances in interferon-sparing, all-oral hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment were a highlight of the 2014 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). The backbone of the nucleotide inhibitor sofosbuvir and the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor ledipasvir with an additional third agent (HCV protease inhibitor or HCV nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) led to a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate 12 weeks after cessation of treatment of 95% to 100% after only 6 weeks of treatment. These results demonstrate the potential of combination directacting antiviral (DAA) therapy for abbreviated, well-tolerated, and highly effective HCV treatment. Two triple-drug regimens that comprised 12 weeks of an NS5A inhibitor, an HCV protease inhibitor, and a nonnucleoside inhibitor also resulted in SVRs of more than 90% in patients with HCV genotype 1. HIV coinfection does not appear to negatively impact response to DAA-based HCV therapy, as evidenced by similar response rates in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients receiving interferonsparing or -containing regimens. There was continued emphasis at CROI 2014 on non-AIDS complications of HIV infection, specifically cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, and bone and endocrine disorders that persist among patients with treated HIV disease and contribute to morbidity and mortality. Finally, new data on novel drugs and combinations for treatment of tuberculosis (TB), patient outcomes using new rapid TB diagnostics, and a short-course TB prevention strategy were presented. "
8318,0.007,7.0,"The relevance of CD4+T-cells, viral load and age in the immunological response to influenza infection and vaccination in HIV-1 infected individuals has previously been pointed out. Our study aimed at assessing, in the setting of 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza vaccination, whether quantification of activation-induced deaminase (AID) expression in blood B-cells may provide additional indications for predicting antibody response to vaccination in HIV-1 infected patients with similar CD4+T-cell counts and age. Forty-seven healthy controls, 37 ART-treated and 17 treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients were enrolled in the study. Blood was collected prior to A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination and at 1, 3 and 6 months after vaccination. Antibody titers to A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay while the mRNA expression levels of AID were measured by quantitative real time PCR. Upon B-cell activation in vitro, AID increase correlated to antibody response to the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine at 1 month after vaccination in all individuals. In addition, the maximum expression levels of AID were significantly higher in those individuals who still carried protective levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies after 6 months from vaccination. No correlation was found between CD4+T-cell counts or age at vaccination or HIV-1 viral load and levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies. Assessing AID expression before vaccination may be an additional useful tool for defining a vaccination strategy in immune-compromised individuals at risk of immunization failure."
3505,0.007,7.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) is entering into its third decade affecting more than 40 million persons on the plane, with an extraordinary incidence in the underdeveloped world, especially in the African continent where more than 25 million are affected, with more than 3 million new yearly infections and where the life expectancy is at 47 years. Although the vaccination is still far away, the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy in the middle of the 90's was an important advance that contributed to converting an infection that previously had a very high rate of short-term mortality into a chronic disease. The neurological complications of this infection vary enormously. They affect any location of the neuroaxis and can appear at any stage of infection. It is not rare that more than one neurological complication exists. Such complications may be a consequence of the infection itself (primary) or related with immune depression accompanying it (secondary). Among the former, dementia associated to HIV and peripheral polyneuropathy stand out. Among the latter, opportunistic viral and fungal infections and lymphoma of the nervous systems stand out. In recent years different tests that help to establish the diagnoses of these entities have been developed, a necessary step to initiate adequate therapies. The immune state of the patient, reflected by the peripheral count of CD4 lymphocytes and serum viral load, helps us to establish the most likely causes of the neurological problems that appear in the context of this infection. We briefly review the most outstanding characteristics of each one of them in this work."
4018,0.007,7.0,"Although HAART has resulted in improved health outcomes for most HIV-infected individuals, liver failure has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). In HBV mono-infected individuals, core deletion mutants are associated with more aggressive liver disease. As HIV accelerates HBV liver disease progression, we hypothesized that HIV-HBV co-infected individuals have increased frequency of core mutations including deletions. To test this hypothesis, we have analysed genome-length sequences of HBV DNA from patients both prior to and during antiviral therapy."
3951,0.007,7.0,"To determine the current risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in multiply transfused thalassemia patients, we tested sera from such patients in New York City for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and its antibody (anti-HBs) using radioimmunoassay techniques. Altogether 48 per cent of the patients had either HBsAg (4.5%) or anti-HBs (43.9%) positive sera. The prevalence of these HBV markers was related to both the number of units transfused and the year blood transfusion therapy was begun, although evidence suggested that the latter factor had the greatest influence. Donor HBsAg screening began in New York in 1969, and only one patient first transfused since that time had HBV marker positive serum. Thus, multiply-transfused thalassemia patients now appear to be at little risk of HBV infection from transfusions. Sera were also tested for antibody to the hepatitis A virus (anti-HA) using immune adherence hemaglutination. Anti-HA prevalence was only 4.9 per cent, no greater than rates reported among nontransfused children, providing evidence against a significant role for blood transfusions in hepatitis A virus transmission."
8668,0.007,7.0,"To compare the seroprevalence of and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) among patients attending a public sexually transmitted disease clinic, the authors conducted both voluntary and blinded seroprevalence surveys between June 1989 and August 1990. For the voluntary survey, every twenty-fifth patient attending the clinic for a new problem was invited to receive anonymous testing for HIV antibody. For the blinded survey, sera obtained for syphilis serologies from 2,297 (86%) of the 2,682 patients attending the clinic for a new problem were tested for HIV antibody after all personal identifiers were removed. Of the 946 eligible patients, 631 (66.7%) agreed to participate in the voluntary survey. Black men were significantly less likely to participate than other men and women (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of HIV antibody was 25% greater in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey (15.2% and 11.4%, respectively, p < 0.05). This difference was due primarily to black homosexual/bisexual men, who had a 12.7-fold greater risk of HIV infection in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey. These results suggest that blinded seroprevalence surveys may provide a better prevalence estimate of HIV infection than voluntary surveys. The greater risk for HIV infection observed among homosexual and bisexual black men, who were tested only in the blinded serosurvey, suggests that efforts to increase voluntary testing for HIV infection in this group should be developed."
7542,0.007,7.0,"Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is an important public health issue, because it may affect the outcome of antiretroviral treatment. The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with TDR mutations defined according to the list of the World Health Organization was investigated among 53 therapy-naïve persons with confirmed recent HIV-1 infection diagnosed in Poland, in the years 2008-2010. Proviral DNA was amplified, sequenced, and screened for the TDR mutations in the pol gene fragments coding for the whole protease and the initial 256 residues of the reverse transcriptase. The frequency of sequences with at least one TDR mutation was 11.3%. In four (7.5%) sequences at least one resistance mutation related to reverse transcriptase inhibitors was identified, and in further two (3.8%) sequences one mutation related to protease inhibitors' resistance was present. The moderate rate of TDR highlights the need for a continuous surveillance and resistance testing among treatment-naïve individuals to optimize treatment effects within a country. "
1495,0.007,7.0,"Minimizing death and ensuring high retention and good adherence remain ongoing challenges for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment programs. We examined whether the addition of community-based accompaniment (characterized by daily home visits from a community health worker, directly observed treatment, nutritional support, transportation stipends, and other support as needed) to the Rwanda national model for antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery would improve retention in care, viral load suppression, and change in CD4 count, relative to the national model alone."
4293,0.007,7.0,"In order to evaluate the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the etiology of chronic liver diseases, paired sera of 143 patients with biopsy-documented chronic hepatitis were tested for HBsAg and anti-HBs by radioimmunoassay method. HBsAg was detected in 67.3% of patients with a preceding verified eipsode of acute hepatitis, and in 26.7% of patients with a cryptogenic form of chronic hepatitis. HBsAg was not found in any of patients with alcoholic chronic hepatitis and in only two of 18 patients with other forms of chronic liver disease. No significant difference in the incidence of anti-HBs was observed in all groups of patients. According to previous studies our results confirm the higher prevalence of HBV infection in etiology of chronic persistent and aggressive hepatitis and indicate that this prevalence may be observed especially in Middle and South Italy. The presence of HBsAg in the serum of 37.2% of our patients with cirrhosis compared with 9% of reported cases in North Italy suggest that HBV plays an important role in the etiology of cirrhosis of the liver in our area."

This study investigated the impact of this funding policy on the society and health care system."
1939,0.007,7.0,"Improving health literacy is a necessary intervention for people with chronic health conditions to ensure adherence with long or life therapies and increase participation in self-care. While adherence is a multifactorial process, increasing health literacy among HIV-infected patients at all stages of living with HIV has been shown to improve treatment outcomes. In the era of rapid scale up of HIV care and treatment, little has been done to evaluate the utility of information, education, and communication (IEC) materials for increasing patient health literacy and how patients perceive such materials. Four patient-oriented print IEC brochures in Kiswahili were designed to be read at the clinic waiting areas and also carried home by patients to supplement the knowledge received from routine counselling during clinic visits. Brochures detail antiretroviral therapy and address common myths, side effects, types and management of opportunistic infections, and prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV. We conducted focus group discussions with HIV-infected patients to explore patient perceptions of IEC materials in the urban congested HIV care setting of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Groups of participants were recruited from eight public PEPFAR-supported HIV care and treatment centres in the city (N = 50). In this paper we present the results of those focus group discussions and introduce the print IEC materials as a pilot intervention in a Kiswahili-speaking setting where a need for additional health literacy exists. Further evaluation of these materials will follow as the data becomes available."
8433,0.007,7.0,"In order to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in Royal Australian Navy personnel and to formulate policies for their education, screening and vaccination, a voluntary survey was undertaken. Seven hundred and forty-eight subjects completed a questionnaire that provided details of age, sex, rank, ethnic origin, service abroad, length of service, history of tattooing, liver disease and blood transfusions. Serum was assayed by radioimmunoassay for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (antiHBs) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (antiHBc). The presence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection was correlated with ""risk factors"" by means of the chi 2 test of independence. Fourteen (74%) of 19 personnel from the Pacific Islands, Asia and Africa who were excluded from analysis showed one-or-more such markers. The prevalence of any marker of hepatitis B virus infection was 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9%-5.9%). The individual markers HBsAg, antiHBs and antiHBc were found in 0.4% (95% CI, 0.1%-1.2%), 3.6% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.9%) and 3.9% (95% CI, 2.5%-5.3%) of subjects, respectively. The annual attack rate was estimated to be less than 1%. Factors which had a significant correlation with an increased prevalence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection included tattooing (especially if this had been performed in Asia), age, the duration of service and service abroad. Based on these data, and given the reduced cost of hepatitis B vaccines, vaccination now is considered worth while. A policy of vaccinating all personnel who may be required for service at sea, and others at risk, now is in effect. Educational programmes that are aimed at minimizing the risk of exposure to hepatitis B and other viral infections have been instituted."
1710,0.007,7.0,"The clinical and laboratory features of six human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with atypical mycobacterial skeletal infections, seen at a county outpatient HIV facility or university outpatient clinic, are reviewed and compared with other reported cases. Atypical mycobacterial skeletal infections are a manifestation of advanced HIV disease, with most cases having CD4 counts < 100/mm3 at the time these infections become clinically apparent. Multiple sites are frequently involved, and concomitant skin infection with the same organism is common, especially with Mycobacterium haemophilum. The incidence of atypical mycobacterial skeletal infection in HIV-infected individuals was significantly higher than in the general county hospital district patient population, whereas the frequency of Myobacterium tuberculosis skeletal infection did not differ significantly between the two populations. The clinician therefore should maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical mycobacteria in a patient presenting with skeletal infection in the setting of a markedly depressed CD4 count."
242,0.007,7.0,"To assess the epidemiology of infection with the delta agent associated with hepatitis B virus, sera from 1314 carriers of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 687 patients with hepatitis B collected in 1978-1981 from different regions of Italy were tested for delta antigen and antibody to the antigen (anti-delta), and the characteristics of delta-positive patients were analyzed. Anti-delta was found in each center participating in the study, indicating that delta infection has spread throughout Italy. Its prevalence was higher in carriers in southern Italy and in those with chronic hepatitis. In northern Italy, delta infection predominated among southern emigrants in industrial towns but also among parenteral drug addicts with hepatitis B virus infection. The prevalence of delta markers was variable and generally low in acute hepatitis B, suggesting that in Italy self-limited forms of delta infection occur sporadically or by limited outbreaks. Delta infection appears to be endemic in southern Italy but a new epidemiologic event in northern Italy, where it was probably introduced by southern emigrants and is presently exceeding its ethnic confinement to spread selectively in communities of drug addicts. Presumably, the endemicity of delta is maintained by transmission of this agent from carrier to carrier of the HBsAg."
5380,0.007,7.0,"Although zidovudine (ZDV) is effective in HIV-1-infected patients, the duration of its efficacy may be short when treatment is started in advanced HIV disease. This pilot prospective case-control study was designed to evaluate the combination of ZDV plus didanosine [ddI] compared with ZDV monotherapy as an initial therapeutic strategy. 'Control' patients (ZDV monotherapy) were matched with 'case' patients (ZDV plus ddI combination therapy) according to the presence or absence of AIDS-defining criteria at entry and CD4 cell count. The case patient group consisted of 35 consecutive HIV-1-infected individuals with < or = 300 CD4 cells/mm3, no previous experience of antiretroviral therapy and who accepted treatment with a combination of ZDV plus ddI. The control patient group consisted of 35 consecutive patients with similar characteristics, but who preferred to start treatment with ZDV alone. Control patients received 250 mg ZDV bid and case patients received ZDV at the same dose plus ddI (200 mg bid). Primary study endpoints were virological (serum HIV-1 RNA) and immunological (CD4 cell count) responses. Viral phenotype (syncytium-inducing (SI) or non-syncytium-inducing (NSI)), development of mutations at codons 215, 41 and 74 and clinical progression (new AIDS-defining event or death) were also assessed. Virological and CD4 cell count responses were significantly greater and more sustained in the group treated with ZDV plus ddI than in the control group, with peak responses of -1.2 +/- 0.7 log10 versus -0.3 +/- 0.4 log10 at 1 month (P = 0.0003) and 61 +/- 52 cells/mm3 versus 19 +/- 25 cells/mm3 at 2 months (P = 0.001), respectively. In both groups the percentage of patients developing a mutation at codon 215 was around 80 per cent at 12 months. A mutation at codon 74 was detected in 30 per cent of case patients at 12 months. Five case patients (14 per cent) versus 12 control patients (34 per cent) showed signs of clinical progression (P = 0.09). In a multivariate model, clinical progression was significantly associated with a baseline"
8094,0.007,7.0,"There is a high prevalence of substance abuse and psychiatric disorders among HIV-infected individuals. Importantly, drug and alcohol-use disorders are frequently co-morbid with depression, anxiety and severe mental illness. Not only do these disorders increase the risk of contracting HIV, they have also been associated with decreased highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) utilisation, adherence and virological suppression. The literature evaluating the relationship between substance abuse and HIV outcomes has primarily focused on injection drug users, although there has been increasing interest in alcohol, cocaine and marijuana. Similarly, the mental health literature has focused largely on depression, with a lesser focus on severe mental illness or anxiety. To date, there is little literature evaluating the association between co-occurring HIV, substance abuse and mental illness on HAART uptake, adherence and virological suppression. Adherence interventions in these populations have demonstrated mixed efficacy. Both directly observed therapy and pharmacist-assisted interventions appear promising, as do integrated behavioural interventions. However, the current intervention literature has several limitations: few of these studies are randomised, controlled trials; the sample sizes have generally been small; and co-occurring substance abuse and mental illness has not specifically been targeted in these studies. Future studies examining individual substances of abuse, psychiatric disorders and co-occurring substance abuse and psychiatric disorders on HIV outcomes will inform targeted adherence interventions."
2679,0.007,7.0,"Since expression of both interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2-receptor-alpha (IL-2R-alpha) by lymphocytes is inhibited by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro, we hypothesized that HIV-co-infection among persons with tuberculosis (TB) might impair T-lymphocyte responses to TB via this mechanism. We measured soluble IL-2R-alpha (sIL-2R-alpha), a surrogate marker of T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation, and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor I (sTNF-RI) in sera from West African patients categorized into 4 groups: those with TB alone (TB+ HIV-, n = 55), CD4-matched groups with TB and HIV co-infection (TB+ HIV+, n = 50) or HIV infection alone (TB- HIV+, n = 35), and patients with neither disease (TB- HIV-, n = 35). The median level of sIL-2R-alpha was markedly greater in the TB+ HIV- group (1580 U/mL) compared to the TB- HIV- (670 U/mL; P < 0.001) and TB- HIV+ (880 U/mL; P < 0.01) groups. More importantly, the median concentration of sIL-2R-alpha was much lower in the TB+ HIV+ group (855 U/mL) compared to the TB+ HIV- group (1580 U/mL; P < 0.01) despite similar levels of sTNF-RI. These results suggest that T-lymphocyte activation in TB patients is impaired by HIV co-infection and, furthermore, this suppressive effect was independent of numerical depletion of CD4 lymphocytes. Impairment to IL-2-signalling might contribute to the profound impact that HIV has had on both the incidence and the clinicopathological manifestations of TB."
1691,0.007,7.0,"Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) infections remain major public health issues globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Impairment of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity by HIV and/or TB infections may limit the host's defences against other pathogens, including the diarrheagenic protozoan Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia intestinalis, and Entamoeba histolytica. During September-December 2015 a cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence and molecular diversity of these enteric parasites among HIV- and/or TB-infected patients at a medical reference centre in Chowke district, southern Mozambique. A total of 99 stool specimens were initially screened by direct microscopy and further confirmed and characterised by molecular methods. DNA sequence analyses of the genes encoding the small subunit ribosomal RNA and the 60-kDa glycoprotein were used for the typing and sub-typing of Cryptosporidium isolates, respectively. G. intestinalis-positive isolates by real-time PCR were subsequently typed at the glutamate dehydrogenase locus. Differential diagnosis of E. histolytica/dispar was achieved by real-time PCR. G. intestinalis (8.1%) was the enteric protozoan more frequently detected, followed by Cryptosporidium spp. (7.1%), and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (6.1%). Two HIV-infected (but not TB-infected) patients harbour G. intestinalis and Cryptosporidium spp. co-infections. Two (29%) G. intestinalis isolates were successfully characterised, revealing the presence of known AII and novel BIV genotypes. Four (57%) Cryptosporidium isolates were unmistakeable assigned to C. hominis, identifying two (IbA10G2 and IdA22) sub-types. Cryptosporidium infections were not associated to diarrhoea in HIV-positive patients, probably because improved immune function in the affected individuals due to antiretroviral therapy. G. intestinalis was considered a non-opportunistic pathogen, whereas the presence of E. histolytica could not be confirmed by molecular methods. Based on their common presence in the studied clinical population, we recommend the effective diagnosis and treatment of these enteropathogens for improving the management of HIV and TB patients."
2628,0.007,7.0,"In the era of antiretroviral therapy, HIV infection has become a chronic illness with associated multimorbidity, and practitioners are faced with an emerging population of HIV-infected patients with evolving needs for advance care planning (ACP), defined as communication between individuals and their proxies to plan for future health care decisions. This article provides a review of original research studies on ACP in HIV-infected adults in the era of antiretroviral therapy (1996-present) from PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Eleven studies conducted between 1996 and 2015 met the selection criteria, with study sizes ranging from 9 to 2864 participants. Most studies consisted of white men in outpatient settings and had poorly defined definitions of ACP. Prevalence of ACP was variable (36%-54% had end-of-life communication, 8%-47% had advance directives). Lack of ACP was most commonly associated with low income, followed by lower severity of illness, low education level, black or Hispanic race, female sex, younger age, injection drug use, and social isolation. Practitioners reported limited time or energy and inadequate preparation or training as barriers to ACP. Existing literature on ACP in the era of antiretroviral therapy is limited, but shows that ACP prevalence in HIV-infected individuals is variable depending on socioeconomic factors, severity of illness, and practitioner resources and training. More research is needed to increase ACP among HIV-infected individuals. "
5876,0.007,7.0,"Many physicians, dentists, and allied health personnel sustain occupational exposures to blood and other body fluids that increase their risk of contracting type B viral hepatitis. Overall, the risk of hepatitis B among persons employed in health-related fields is estimated to be approximately four times that in the general adult population. Studies on the incidence of infection and the prevalence of hepatitis B serologic markers have further defined risk in specific occupational categories and work activities. Physicians and dentists are five to ten times more likely than the general adult population to experience hepatitis B infection. Infection rates ten or more times above the average have often been characteristic of surgeons, patient care personnel in dialysis units and institutions for the mentally handicapped, and clinical laboratory workers having frequent contact with blood samples."
4821,0.007,7.0,"Evaluation of resistance pattern in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Retrospective study of hepatitis B virus (HBV) resistance mutations in patients found viraemic after first-line treatment. HBV viral load was determined by a real-time polymerase chain reaction and the substitutions in HBV-DNA were studied by polymerase sequencing test. First line treatment had failed in 12 out of 33 patients (36%) receiving anti-HBV drugs. The 12 patients with persistent viraemia were all lamivudine (LAM) experienced and 7 had a polymerase sequencing test available. LAM substitution mutations L180M + M204V/I were found in six out of seven cases, with an accompanying V173L mutation in three cases. These mutations were also related with changes in HBsAg. The use of potent drugs in the first line anti-HBV therapy may reduce the resistance mutations in the future."
9700,0.007,7.0,"An assay, specifically optimized to evaluate the anti-HIV activity of antiretrovirals by flow cytometry analysis, is described. As widely used anti-HIV agents, zidovudine (AZT), abacavir (ABC), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (DDI), lamivudine (3TC), nevirapine (NVP), and efavirenz (EFV), and as drugs of recent approval raltegravir (RAL), etravirine (ETR), and rilpivirine (RPV), were utilized as reference drugs. HIV-1 NL4-3 virus was prepared by transfection of HEK293T cells with purified plasmid DNA and quantified by p24 antigen-capture assay. For infection, CEM-GFP cells were exposed to vehicle or to several concentrations of the drugs for 2 hr at 37 °C before HIV-1 NL4-3 was added to each sample. The adsorption was prolonged for 3 hr at 37 °C. After 72 hr of incubation, HIV-induced GFP expression in infected CEM-GFP cells was assessed by flow cytometry analysis and expressed as % positive cells. For comparison, p24 production in supernatants was assessed by a commercial ELISA kit. On the basis of IC50 values, the anti-HIV activity, as assayed by this method, was EFV > 3TC > AZT > NVP > DDI > ABC and ETR > RPV > RAL. The comparison between the IC50 values calculated through flow cytometry and p24 production revealed overlapping results, showing that the optimized protocol of CEM-GFP infection with HIV NL4-3 is a suitable method to perform quantitative, rapid and low-expensive screening tests to evaluate the in vitro effect of new candidate anti-HIV drugs."
6626,0.007,7.0,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of two-gene locus cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) +49 and CD86 +1057 were previously reported to influence the outcome of liver transplantation (LT) with respect to allograft acceptance. SNP at CTLA-4 +49 was also suggested to be associated with the individual difference in the clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, their influence on the incidence of post-LT HBV reinfection was not clear. With the increasing knowledge of costimulatory mechanisms on LT and host immune response, we designed this study to investigate the relationship between different alleles as well as genotypes at these two locations and HBV reinfection after LT."
2495,0.007,7.0,"To estimate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) among parturients in an area with a high cumulative incidence of AIDS, an HIV seroprevalence study was conducted in 1988 in Los Angeles County. Test results were available from 8485 (86.1%) of the 9860 women delivering at four public hospitals. The test results were linked to demographic and medical information available from routinely collected delivery records. Three specimens were HIV-positive, for a seroprevalence of 3.5 per 10,000. The seropositive women were all Latina. The prevalence of HIV among women delivering at all hospitals in Los Angeles County has been shown to be relatively low compared with that of other metropolitan areas with a high number of AIDS cases, such as New York city, but appears to be even lower among women delivering at public hospitals during this time period. This low prevalence is attributed to the predominance of Latinas, who may have lower levels of infection, among public hospital parturients. The relatively low prevalence of HIV among injection drug users in Los Angeles County may contribute to the overall lower prevalence among women in Los Angeles County compared with those in New York city. This study supplements county-specific data obtained from statewide blinded neonatal testing by providing details on HIV seroprevalence among the catchment populations of public hospitals in Los Angeles County."
4360,0.007,7.0,"Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) used against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) need to be activated intracellularly to their triphosphate moiety to inhibit HIV replication. Intracellular concentrations of these NRTI triphosphates, especially zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP), are relatively low (low numbers of femtomoles per 10(6) cells) in HIV-infected patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Recently, several methods have used either high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with radioimmunoassay to obtain in vivo measurements of ZDV-TP. The limit of detection (LOD) by these methods ranged from 20 to 200 fmol/10(6) cells. In this report, we describe the development of a method to determine intracellular ZDV-TP concentrations in HIV-infected patients using SPE and HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry for analysis. The LOD by this method is 4.0 fmol/10(6) cells with a linear concentration range of at least 4 orders of magnitude from 4. 0 to 10,000 fmol/10(6) cells. In hispanic HIV-infected patients, ZDV-TP was detectable even when the sampling time after drug administration was 15 h. Intracellular ZDV-TP concentrations in these patients ranged from 41 to 193 fmol/10(6) cells. The low LOD obtained with this method will provide the opportunity for further in vivo pharmacokinetic studies of intracellular ZDV-TP in different HIV-infected populations. Furthermore, this methodology could be used to perform simultaneous detection of two or more NRTIs, such as ZDV-TP and lamivudine triphosphate."
9755,0.007,7.0,"Four hundred and fifty-nine Ethiopian volunteer blood donors were prospectively studied for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Delta agent infections. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was 11%, anti-HBs and only anti-HBc 66% and 2%, respectively. Thus, the total HBV infection rate was 79%. There was a single donor with antibody against Delta antigen. The rarity of HBeAg among HBsAg carriers, the lack of occurrence of factors favouring transmission and risk calculations using the available data indicate that post-transfusion hepatitis due to HBV is unlikely to be common in this highly endemic country with very limited financial resources allocated for health services. Thus, we question the validity of indiscriminate screening of all donated blood and we suggest that health policies should emphasize the need for preventive measures."
3241,0.007,7.0,"The resuscitation of a trauma patient is a very hectic and seemingly chaotic situation. The nature of the situation increases the likelihood that a health care worker will receive an accidental needle stick while caring for the patient. There is also a common belief that there is a higher prevalence of communicable bloodborne diseases in the trauma population, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes the greatest amount of fear. This belief of higher prevalence communicable diseases in the trauma population is supported by the literature. We sent blood from our Code One (life-threatening) trauma population for analysis for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies. We found that 0.52% of our trauma population had HIV. We also found that 1.5 per cent had hepatitis B surface antigen, and 13.8 per cent had hepatitis C antibodies. Our prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B is similar to that found in other studies of the trauma populations and higher than the general population. Our hepatitis C prevalence is surprising, considering the very low reported prevalence in the general population. Hepatitis C may be a more significant threat to the health of medical personnel than previously believed."
4117,0.007,7.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates of 8 Ethiopian and 8 Swedish untreated AIDS-patients were examined for their sensitivity to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) and leukocyte-derived interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). No significant difference in drug sensitivity was found between Ethiopian and Swedish isolates, which all were sensitive to AZT, ddI and IFN-alpha except for one Swedish isolate. This isolate exhibited a mutation at amino acid position 215. These results suggest that it should be possible to perform clinical trials in Ethiopia using the same dose regimens as in Sweden."
7695,0.007,7.0,"Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy is an important intervention to prevent the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV and to promote maternal health. Early initiation of ART is particularly important to achieve viral suppression rapidly before delivery. However, current approaches to start ART in pregnancy may be problematic in many settings, with referrals between antenatal care (ANC) and ART services, and delays for patient preparation before ART initiation. These steps contribute to a sizable proportion of women failing to receive adequate duration of ART before delivery, increasing the risk of MTCT. To address these limitations, we developed the rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy (RAP) programme. The programme featured the use of point-of-care CD4 testing to identify ART-eligible women with CD4 cell counts ≤ 350 cells/µl; immediate ART initiation in women on the same day that eligibility was determined, if possible; and intensive counselling and support for ART initiation during the first few weeks on ART. We implemented RAP in an antenatal clinic setting in Cape Town South Africa. Between February and August 2011, a total of 221 HIV-infected women were referred to the programme for CD4 cell count testing and 101 (46%) were eligible for ART. Of these, 98 women (97%) started therapy during pregnancy, 89 (91%) on the day of referral to the service. In-depth interviews suggested that although there were substantial challenges facing HIV-infected women initiating ART in pregnancy, the availability of immediate services and counselling support played an important role in addressing these. While further research is needed, this evaluation demonstrates that a novel service delivery approach may facilitate rapid ART initiation in pregnancy."

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in relation to anaemia and CD4 counts among HIV-infected patients in Benin City, Nigeria. Using a serial sampling method, a total of 2000 HIV-infected patients were recruited on their first visit prior to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital from August 2007 to August 2009. Stool and blood samples were collected from each patient. The stool samples were processed using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique to microscopically identify the oocysts of Cryptosporidium species, Isospora belli, Cyclospora species and spores of Microsporidium species while saline and iodine preparations were used for identifying the ova, cysts and parasites of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Taenia spp and other parasites. The blood specimens were equally analyzed using the flow cytometry for CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and autoanalyzer - sysmex kx - 21 for haemoglobin concentration. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 93.3% while 18% had parasitic infections. There was a significant relationship between CD4 count <200cells/microL and anaemia (P<0.0001). Cryptosporidium species (P= 0.005), A. lumbricoides (P=0.035), hookworm and Taenia species (P=0.014) were associated with anaemia. Anaemia was associated with CD4 count while Cryptosporidium species, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species were the intestinal parasitic agents associated with anaemia. In conclusion the prevalence of anaemia in HIV-infected patients is high low CD4 count is a significant risk factor of acquiring anaemia. Except for isosporiasis, cryptosporidiosis, A. lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species in HIV infected individuals are parasitic agents associated with anaemia. Routine screening for intestinal parasites and holistic management of anaemia is advocated."

No large scale U.S. studies have investigated the association between food insecurity and severity of HIV disease or the mechanism of this possible association. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of food insecurity on HIV disease outcomes in a large cohort of HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral medications.
8908,0.007,7.0,"Following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration into host cell DNA, the viral promoter can become transcriptionally silent in the absence of appropriate signals and factors. HIV-1 gene expression is dependent on regulatory elements contained within the long terminal repeat (LTR) that drive the synthesis of viral RNAs and proteins through interaction with multiple host and viral factors. Previous studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and Sp site III (3T, C-to-T change at position 3, and 5T, C-to-T change at position 5 of the binding site, respectively, when compared to the consensus B sequence) that are low affinity binding sites and correlate with more advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. Stably transfected cell lines containing the wild type, 3T, 5T, and 3T5T LTRs were developed utilizing bone marrow progenitor, T, and monocytic cell lines to explore the LTR phenotypes associated with these genotypic changes from an integrated chromatin-based microenvironment. Results suggest that in nonexpressing cell clones LTR-driven gene expression occurs in a SNP-specific manner in response to LTR activation or treatment with trichostatin A treatment, indicating a possible cell type and SNP-specific mechanism behind the epigenetic control of LTR activation.

9746,0.007,7.0,"When faced with the ever-increasing demand for the rapid laboratory diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), as well as a variety of fungal, parasitic, and bacterial opportunistic infections in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals, the Chest Service and the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at San Francisco General Hospital developed a coordinated plan for the collection and rapid examination of specimens to allow presumptive diagnoses to be made as quickly as possible. Clinical studies have been performed to determine the efficacy of different specimens and diagnostic systems for the provision of clinically useful information. Our approach has been to provide medical care on an outpatient basis using less invasive diagnostic systems that do not require direct physician participation. Direct laboratory examination of a single specimen submitted to microbiology often yielded presumptive or final diagnoses that were directly communicated to the physician. The evolution of PCP diagnosis in AIDS patients is described. Our current procedure of examining mucolysed, concentrated induced sputum stained with a rapid Giemsatype stain, Diff-Quik (Baxter/Scientific Products, McGaw, IL), has a sensitivity for P carinii detection of 74% to 77%. We have found that the use of commercially available immunofluorescence staining diminishes screening time and increases the sensitivity of P carinii detection in mucolysed concentrated induced sputum. We also describe the appearance of bacterial, fungal, and parasitic agents seen on direct examination and the usefulness of antigen detection, serology, and various microbiologic culture systems for diagnosing infections caused by these organisms."
2946,0.007,7.0,"Vitamin D plays role in bone health and the regulation of the immune system. A cross-sectional study of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels was conducted among HIV-1-infected Thai patients to determine the prevalence and associated factors of low vitamin D levels (25[OH]D <30 ng/mL) in tropical setting. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D was measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Of 178 patients, 58% received antiretroviral therapy at median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of 7.4 (5.9-8.5) years. The prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) and insufficiency (20-29.9 ng/mL) was 26.8% and 44.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that receiving efavirenz (EFV) was significantly associated with low vitamin D status (odds ratio = 3.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-12.15, P <.05). The mean (±standard deviation) level of 25(OH)D in patients receiving and not receiving EFV was 22.9 (6.6) and 28.6 (10.7) ng/mL, respectively, (P <.05). Low vitamin D status is common and needs to be assessed among HIV-infected patients including tropical residents especially when EFV is used."
8189,0.007,7.0,"The purpose of this report is to determine the influence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic on medical students' training and career plans through a prospective, anonymous self-administered survey of 10 Likert-scaled (1 strongly agree to 5 strongly disagree) responses to statements assessing attitude toward patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adequacy of knowledge and experience with HIV, and influence of HIV on career choices. The study was done at a major AIDS referral university teaching hospital. The participants were first- through fourth-year medical students in spring 1990. A 72% (of 451 students) response revealed that both surgery and emergency medicine were perceived as high risk of exposure specialties. Students indicated an overall willingness to care for HIV-positive patients (mean, 2.54) and a general adequacy of knowledge and experience (mean 2.54). The AIDS epidemic has had little influence for training, future career, and practice locations (mean, 4.06). Responses differed by class year. The later class years were more willing to care for HIV patients (P < .001) and indicated more knowledge and experience with HIV (P < .001). Influence on career, training and practice location choices were without class trend. In contrast to some studies, this group of medical students had relatively positive attitudes toward patients with HIV and were not particularly influenced by the AIDS epidemic regarding career choices."
8594,0.007,7.0,"The U.S. military represents a unique population within the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) pandemic. The last comprehensive study of HIV-1 in members of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps (Sea Services) was completed in 2000, before large-scale combat operations were taking place. Here, we present molecular characterization of HIV-1 from 40 Sea Services personnel who were identified during their seroconversion window and initially classified as HIV-1 negative during screening. Protease/reverse transcriptase (pro/rt) and envelope (env) sequences were obtained from each member of the cohort. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on these regions to determine relatedness within the cohort and calculate the most recent common ancestor for the related sequences. We identified 39 individuals infected with subtype B and one infected with CRF01_AE. Comparison of the pairwise genetic distance of Sea Service sequences and reference sequences in the env and pro/rt regions showed that five samples were part of molecular clusters, a group of two and a group of three, confirmed by single genome amplification. Real-time molecular monitoring of new HIV-1 acquisitions in the Sea Services may have a role in facilitating public health interventions at sites where related HIV-1 infections are identified."
596,0.007,7.0,"Little information exists on the frequency, severity, and timing of first-line anti-tuberculosis drug-related adverse events (TB-AEs) in HIV-tuberculosis coinfected (HIV-TB) patients in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. This matched-cohort study included HIV-TB patients as cases and HIV-uninfected tuberculosis (non-HIV-TB) patients as controls. Tuberculosis was culture-confirmed in both groups. Cases were matched to controls in a 1:4 ratio on age, sex, and year of diagnosis. TB-AEs were defined as Grade 2 or higher requiring drug discontinuation/regimen change. From 2003 to 2015, 94 cases and 376 controls were analyzed (95% men, 98% Asians). Standard four-drug combination therapy was initiated in 91% of cases and 89% of controls (p = 0.45). Cases had a higher frequency of TB-AE [51% (48/94) vs. 10% (39/376), p < 0.001]. Their major TB-AEs were fever (19%), rash (11%), and neutropenia (11%). TB-AEs were more severe in cases [Grade 3 or higher: cases (71%, 34/48) vs. controls (49%, 19/39), p < 0.001]. The time from treatment initiation to TB-AE was shorter in cases [median 18 (interquartile range 12-28) vs. 27 (15-57) days, p = 0.027], and 73% of TB-AEs in cases occurred within 4 weeks of starting anti-tuberculosis treatment. HIV infection was an independent risk factor for TB-AEs in the multivariate Cox analysis [adjusted HR (aHR): 6.96; 95% confidence interval: 3.93-12.3]. TB-AEs occurred more frequently in HIV-TB than in non-HIV-TB patients, and were more severe. The majority of TB-AEs occurred within 4 weeks of initiating anti-tuberculosis treatment. Because TB-AEs may delay ART initiation, careful monitoring during this period is warranted in coinfected patients."
1912,0.006,6.0,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is characterized by the presence of HBV DNA in serum and/or in the liver of patients negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Occult infection may impact in several different clinical contexts including the risk of HBV transmission with transfusion or transplantation, and endogenous viral reactivation. The gold standard test for detection of occult infection is the amplification of HBV DNA. However, the serological assay for the long-lasting antibody response to the highly immunogenic HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) represents a qualified candidate as a surrogate for DNA amplification, or for increasing overall sensitivity when assessing the risk of occult hepatitis in peripheral blood. The risk of occult hepatitis associated with anti-HBc seropositivity has been demonstrated extensively, and the presence of antibody response to HBc can be considered a sentinel marker of occult HBV infection."
6947,0.006,6.0,"The importance of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in the progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a subject of debate. This study sought to identify independent risk factors involved in development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly in patients with chronic HBV infection who have normal ALT values. Data from 381 consecutive hepatitis B patients were analyzed with average ALT integration values < or = 40 IU/L and follow-up periods of > 3 years. Integration values were calculated from biochemical tests, and serological markers associated with the cumulative incidence of HCC were analyzed. HCC developed in 17 of the 381 patients (4.5%) during the follow-up period. Male sex (hazard ratio, 6.011 [95% confidence interval: 1.353-26.710], P = 0.018), high HBV-DNA levels (> or = 5.0 log copies/ml; 5.125 [1.880-13.973], P = 0.001), low platelet counts (< 15.0 x 10(4)/mm(3); 4.803 [1.690-13.647], P = 0.003), and low total cholesterol levels (< 130 mg/dl; 5.983 [1.558-22.979], P = 0.009) were significantly associated with greater incidence of HCC development. High HBV-DNA levels and low platelet counts are associated with the development of HCC in patients infected with hepatitis B who have normal ALT values. Therefore, maintenance of low HBV-DNA levels is important for the prevention of HCC in patients with low platelet counts, particularly in patients whose ALT values fall within the current normal range."
720,0.006,6.0,"The scarcity of liver donors requires consideration of grafts from sources not previously used. Allografts from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-carriers without a significant liver disease have been proposed for liver transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Combination prophylaxis schemes against HBV post-liver transplantation (LT) recurrence are currently available; the efficacy of those schemes in HBV-related cirrhosis and HCC must be assessed. This report describes the allocation of HBsAg-positive grafts in three HBsAg-positive recipients, with HBV-related cirrhosis and evolving HCC lesions, two of them with hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) coinfection. Patients were administered anti-hepatitis B immunoglobulins (HBIGs) and lamivudine in order to prevent HBV recurrence. In spite of anti-HBV prophylaxis, HBV infection did persist after LT in all patients (no serum clearance of HBsAg). HBV replication assessed by serum HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) presence was detected in the first month after LT in the 3 recipients. A prompt HDV reinfection with a clinical and histological pattern of hepatitis was observed in the 2 HBV / HDV coinfected recipients. In 1 of them, an evolving chronic hepatitis required a second LT. The non-HDV-infected patient showed an uneventful follow-up, but the lack of the neutralizing effect of HBIGs and the high risk of escape mutants forced the addition of adefovir-dipivoxil to lamivudine, in order to prevent viral variants and hepatitis recurrence. In conclusion, allografts from HBsAg-positive donors in HBsAg-positive recipients are associated with the persistence of the HBsAg after LT due to the failure of HBIG prophylaxis, even if lamivudine does inhibit virion production. This condition favors HDV replication and HDV hepatitis recurrence in coinfected patients. The allocation of HBsAg-positive grafts in HBsAg-positive recipients could be justified only in recipients without HDV coinfection and a combined prophylaxis with lamivudine and adefovir-dipivoxil is currently the best way to manage escape mutants in these recipients."

A cure for the fully developed AIDS related to HIV infection remains elusive, and HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death among adults between the ages of 25 and 44. Life expectancy, however, has gradually increased over the years, resulting in a concern for a potential increase in the incidence of secondary psychiatric manifestations. Knowledge of the neuropathology of HIV-CNS dysfunction and familiarity with its clinical presentation can aid clinicians in a determination of the appropriate therapy inclusive of psychiatric care that may be useful for a specific individual in their treatment."

The objectives of this study were to determine factors associated with interest in an app to self-manage drinking and to identify differences in baseline mobile technology use among PLWH by drinking level."
7024,0.006,6.0,"Oligonucleotide fingerprinting of genomic DNA from oral isolates of four different Candida species other than C. albicans and atypical chlamydospore-positive isolates from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals and AIDS patients was investigated as a means for differentiating between isolates within individual species. Oligonucleotides composed of simple repetitive sequence motifs, including (GACA)4, (GATA)4, (GGAT)4, (GTG)5, and (GT)8, all yielded fingerprints suitable for strain segregation of 8 C. tropicalis isolates, 12 Torulopsis (Candida) glabrata isolates, 8 atypical Candida isolates, and, except for (GATA)4, 2 C. krusei probe in turn and so generate several distinct DNA fingerprints of the same DNA sample. However, none of the probes yielded fingerprints suitable for strain segregation with three C. parapsilosis isolates. The (GATA)4 probe was also used to detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms among a genetically closely related group of atypical Candida isolates on primary isolation from an additional HIV-infected patient. These chlamydospore-positive atypical Candida isolates were sucrose positive, were of C. albicans serotype A, hybridized weakly with the C. albicans-specific mid-repeat sequence probe 27A, and yielded fingerprint profiles by random polymorphic DNA analysis that were distinct from those derived from C. albicans isolates. The C. stellatoidea ex-type strain NCPF 3108 was indistinguishable from the atypical Candida isolates in all these tests and also yielded an identical carbohydrate and nitrogen source assimilation profile by using the ID 32C yeast identification system."
6928,0.006,6.0,"The authors examined sexual behaviors, the seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and condom use among 2,314 homosexual and bisexual men tested during 1988-1989 at the AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) National Center in Mexico City. Bisexuals constituted 24% of the sample; the seroprevalence rate was lower for bisexuals than homosexuals (21 vs. 34%). In logistic regressions, HIV-1 seropositivity was independently related to age, education, pattern of insertive/receptive behavior in anal sex, lifetime number of male sex partners, having sex with someone with AIDS, homosexual versus bisexual behavior, and a history of condyloma. The same logistic regressions were found to fit bisexuals and homosexuals. The rate of HIV-1 was reduced in individuals who indicated always requiring their partners to use a condom when practicing receptive anal sex (1% of the total). The most common practice for both homosexuals and bisexuals was ""mixed"" behavior (i.e., both insertive and receptive anal sex); this was also the practice with the highest risk. Bisexuals practiced both vaginal and anal sex with women and reported little condom use. The substantial seroprevalence among bisexuals, their frequent sexual contact with women, and their low rate of condom use imply a continuing role as a bridge of infection to females. Whether this risk will lead to a sustained heterosexual epidemic remains to be determined."
8709,0.006,6.0,"The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with HIV infection among specific population subgroups and complement the HIV surveillance system in Cameroon. Five subgroups (truck drivers, female-sex-workers, university students, health service providers, and residents along Chad-Cameroon petroleum pipeline) were targeted in 2004. Potential participants were approached at their geographically diverse areas and consented to participate in the study. Anonymous blood samples were collected. 4,011 participants were surveyed (35% students, 25% sex-workers, 20% pipeline residents, 12.5% health service providers, 7.5% truck drivers). HIV prevalence was highest among sex-workers [26.4%, (95% CI, 23.6-29.2)], pipeline residents [19.9% (95% CI, 17.1-22.7)] and truck drivers [16.3% (95% CI, 12.3-20.9)] and lowest among health service providers [5.2% (95% CI, 3.4-7.5)] and university students [3.8% (95% CI, 2.9-5.0)]. Risky sexual behaviours were practiced in all subpopulations. Multivariable analysis shows in female-sex-workers that; older age, residing in the grassland region (Northwest and West Provinces) and inconstant condom use were significantly associated with HIV infection. Despite a moderate HIV prevalence in the general Cameroonian population, some subgroups are at much higher risk for HIV transmission and practicing risky sexual behaviours. There is need for expanded prevention and care programs with emphasis on truck drivers, sex-workers and pipeline residents."
3595,0.006,6.0,"The results of a study of screening recommendations for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by family physicians are reported. Of 209 family practice residents and clinical faculty from the four UCLA-affiliated family practice residency programs surveyed, 110 (53%) responded. Each physician was presented with an identical set of five clinical scenarios and asked to make an HIV screening decision in each case. The physicians were also asked to choose from a list of 11 physician roles the one role that best described why they chose to recommend or not recommend an HIV screening test in each particular scenario. Marked variation was observed among the physicians' HIV screening recommendations. The degree of variation was similar between residents and clinical faculty. The physicians predominantly cited concern for the patient's well-being over concern for the public's well-being in making their HIV screening decisions. Three physician roles, (1) to protect the patient from mental suffering, (2) to protect the unborn from disease, and (3) to optimize the patient's future health care, were the roles most cited when an HIV screening test was recommended. Two physician roles, (1) to protect the patient from mental suffering, and (2) to allocate limited health resources properly, were the roles most cited when an HIV screening test was not recommended."
7981,0.006,6.0,"We examined attitudinal and demographic correlates of antiretroviral acceptance and adherence among incarcerated HIV-infected women. Structured interviews were conducted with 102 HIV-infected female prisoners eligible for antiretroviral therapy. Three quarters of the women were currently taking antiretroviral agents, of whom 62% were adherent to therapy. Satisfaction was very high with the HIV care offered at the prison; 67% had been first offered antiretroviral agents while in prison. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed acceptance of the first offer of antiretroviral therapy to be associated with trust in medication safety, lower educational level, and non-black race. Current acceptance of therapy was associated with trust in the medication's efficacy and safety. Medication adherence was correlated with the patient-physician relationship and presence of emotional supports. Nearly one half of these HIV-seropositive women were willing to take experimental HIV medications in prison. This was correlated with satisfaction with existing health care, the presence of HIV-related social supports, and perceived susceptibility to a worsening condition. Acceptance and adherence with antiretroviral agents appear to be significantly associated with trust in medications, trust in the health care system, and interpersonal relationships with physicians and peers. Development of models of care that encourage and support such relationships is essential for improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy, especially for populations that have historically been marginalized from mainstream medical care systems."
4852,0.006,6.0,"To investigate the influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection on preexisting long-term chronic C hepatitis (HCV) 68 liver biopsies from 22 HIV/HCV-coinfected, 13 HIV- and 33 HCV-monoinfected patients and 71 livers obtained at autopsy from 26 HIV/HCV-coinfected and 45 HIV-monoinfected patients were studied by histo- and immunohistochemistry. All HIV patients had reached the advanced stage of immunodeficiency (stage III CDC), except for 3 haemophilias (stage II CDC). HCV infection was associated with a higher degree of portal, periportal and lobular inflammation-regardless of whether there was concurrent HIV infection. HIV/HCV coinfection was associated with a significantly higher rate of granulocytic cholangiolitis than HCV and HIV monoinfection (P < 0.05), a histological feature uncommon in C hepatitis. In HIV/HCV coinfection cholestasis was a predominant histological feature. HCV monoinfection and HCV/HIV coinfection were associated with the highest fibrosis index. In HIV/HCV coinfection centrilobular fibrosis was significantly more marked than in HCV monoinfection (P < 0.05), suggesting an HIV-associated fibrogenic effect. Patients with chronic C hepatitis showed a significantly increased rate of posthepatitic cirrhosis compared with the patients without HCV infection (P < 0.05). At autopsy, 10 of the 20 HIV/HCV-coinfected haemophiliacs had developed cirrhosis because of chronic C hepatitis, whereas cirrhosis was found in only 2 of 6 HIV/HCV-coinfected non-haemophiliacs (1 case of chronic B and C hepatitis, and 1 case of chronic alcohol abuse). No cirrhosis was observed in the 45 autopsy patients with HIV monoinfection. The findings suggest that HIV coinfection aggravates the course of preceding long-term chronic C hepatitis by a more marked (centrilobular) fibrosis. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients are threatened by a higher rate of posthepatitic cirrhosis-particularly in multitransfused haemophiliacs-and cholestatic hepatopathy."

3490,0.006,6.0,"Viral quasispecies analysis is important for basic and clinical research. This study was designed to detect hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome-wide mutation profiling with detailed variant composition in individual patients, especially quasispecies evolution correlating with liver disease progression. We characterized viral populations by massively parallel pyrosequencing at whole HBV genome level in 17 patients with advanced liver disease (ALD) and 30 chronic carriers (CC). An average sequencing coverage of 2047× and 687× in ALD and CC groups, respectively, were achieved. Deep sequencing data resolved the landscapes of HBV substitutions and a more complicated quasispecies composition than previously observed. The values of substitution frequencies in quasispecies were clustered as either more than 80% or less than 20%, forming a unique U-shaped distribution pattern in both clinical groups. Furthermore, quantitative comparison of mutation frequencies of each site between two groups resulted in a spectrum of substitutions associated with liver disease progression, and among which, C2288A/T, C2304A, and A/G2525C/T were novel candidates. Moreover, distinct deletion patterns in preS, X, and C regions were shown between the two groups. In conclusion, pyrosequencing of the whole HBV genome revealed a panorama of viral quasispecies composition, characteristics of substitution distribution, and mutations correlating to severe liver disease.

5074,0.006,6.0,"HIV-1 resistance mutations to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, NRTI; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, NNRTI; and protease inhibitors, PI) represent a challenge for sustainable virologic and immunologic responses. HIV-1 phylogenetic diversity and ARV resistance mutations associated with protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) were assessed among 48 ARV-experienced patients from Goiania/Goias, central west Brazil. The gp41 resistance mutations to the fusion inhibitor (T-20) were analyzed among multidrug-resistant (MDR) patients. PR, partial RT, and gp41 genes were amplified and sequenced from plasma RNA. HIV-1 subtype was assigned by phylogenetic analysis. ARV mutations in PR/RT were analyzed by the Stanford Database. T-20 resistance mutations in gp41 were identified by Stanford, the Los Alamos Database, and other sources. Subtype B represented 79.2% (38/48), subtype F1 4.2% (2/48), subtype C 2.1% (1/48), F1(PR)/B(RT) 8.3% (4/48), and B(PR)/F1(RT) 6.3% (3/48). Secondary drug resistance was observed in 79% (38/48): NRTI resistance (n = 1), NNRTI resistance (n = 1), PI + NRTI or NRTI + NNRTI resistance (n = 20), and PI + NRTI +NNRTI resistance, considered MDR (n = 16). Almost half of the MDR patients had viral loads below 10,000 copies/ml. The gp41 sequences from 14 MDR revealed one F1(PR)/B(RT)/F1(ENV) recombinant and 13 subtype B(PR)/B(RT)/B(ENV) isolates. G36E, N42T, and N43S T-20 resistance mutations were observed in three MDR patients, two of them previously treated with T-20 and the other who had never used T-20. Our data among ARV-experienced patients showed a high proportion of drug-resistance mutations and MDR. T-20 resistance mutations were detected among MDR patients corroborating the importance of T-20 genotyping for clinical management and salvage therapy."
5427,0.006,6.0,"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens have recently been used in HIV-1 infected children in resource-limited settings. Treatment failure with this regimen has become more common. A second regimen needs to be prepared for the Thai national program. Genotypic resistance testing was conducted among HIV-1 infected children who experienced virological failure with antiretroviral therapy (ART) using NNRTI-based regimens. Patterns of resistance mutations were studied and options for a second regimen were determined. There were 21 patients with a median (IQR) age of 4.1 (1.9-7.7) years. Sixteen patients were males. The median CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA at the time of virological failure were 647 cells/mm3 and 5.3 log copies/ml, respectively. The prevalences of patients with > or =1 major mutation conferring resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs were 52% and 43%, respectively. Thymidine analoque mutations, M184V/I, and Q151M were observed in 38%, 33%, and 5%. The patterns of resistance mutations suggest that 48% of patients need a protease inhibitor-based regimen for the second regimen and didanosine+lamivudine is the most required nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone."
1795,0.006,6.0,"Wasting and food insecurity are commonly seen in patients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, and supplementary feeding is often offered in conjunction with ART. Evidence for the effectiveness of such supplementary feeding is scant. A randomised, investigator-blinded, controlled clinical trial of two types of supplementary food, corn/soy blended flour and a ready-to-use peanut butter-based lipid paste, in wasted adults in Blantyre, Malawi is described and the results summarised. A historical control group who did not receive supplementary food is described as well. Provision of about half of the daily energy requirement as a supplementary food for 14 weeks resulted in more rapid restoration of a normal BMI; and the energy-dense, ready-to-use paste was associated with more rapid weight gain than the blended flour. Survival was similar among the 3 groups. The strong association between lower BMI and survival indirectly suggests that there may well be clinical benefit from supplementary feeding in this population. No differences were seen in ART adherence or quality of life with more rapid restoration of BMI. Further research is urgently needed concerning the widespread practice of supplementary feeding in HIV/AIDS care to most effectively utilize this intervention."
2462,0.006,6.0,"Six Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-1/2 immunoassays, including five enzyme immunoassays and one rapid test, were challenged with up to 250 serum samples collected from various global sites. The serum samples were from individuals known to be infected with variants of HIV-1 including group M subtypes A, B, B', C, D, E, F, and G and group O. All immunoassays detected the vast majority of samples tested. Three samples produced low signal over cutoff values in one or more tests: a clade B sample, an untypeable sample with a low antibody titer, and a group O sample. It is concluded that HIV-1 immunoassays used in the United States are capable of detecting most HIV-1 group M variants."
921,0.006,6.0,"Cellular responses against hepatitis C virus (HCV) are impaired in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients showing uncontrolled viral replication and immune suppression. Very few studies have explored to what extent HCV-specific response improves as a consequence of control of HIV replication by highly active antiretroviral therapy. We compared HCV-specific T-cell responses between HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, showing complete viral suppression, and HCV-monoinfected patients."
4941,0.006,6.0,"Outcomes of chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) are varied, with increased morbidity reported in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. The factors driving different outcomes are not well understood, but there is increasing interest in an HLA class I effect. We therefore studied the influence of HLA class I on HBV in an African HIV-positive cohort. We demonstrated that virologic markers of HBV disease activity (hepatitis B e antigen status or HBV DNA level) are associated with HLA-A genotype. This finding supports the role of the CD8(+) T-cell response in HBV control, and potentially informs future therapeutic T-cell vaccine strategies. "
1962,0.006,6.0,"Several infectious agents have been associated with development of lymphoproliferative disorders. Among these is hepatitis C virus (HCV), which infects more than 200 million people worldwide. HCV infection has been linked to progression of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) syndrome and has also been suggested to contribute to development of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Mechanisms responsible for development of lymphoproliferative disorders among HCV-positive patients remain unclear. Accumulating evidence supports a model in which chronic stimulation of B-cells by antigens associated with HCV infection causes nonmalignant B-cell expansion that may evolve into B-cell NHL. The course of disease among HCV-positive B-cell NHL patients may be complicated by coinfection with other infectious agents. This possibility has been explored by studies that have investigated potential interactions between HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as well as between HCV and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Further characterization of the mechanisms by which HCV promotes development of lymphoproliferative disorders may improve diagnosis, classification, and treatment of these conditions."
1165,0.006,6.0,"Physical function limitations have been associated with poor health outcomes, which have a negative impact on quality of life of older individuals. This study examined the association between depression, viral load, and acculturation with physical function among Latino men living with HIV. A secondary data analysis was performed using a cross-sectional data of 146 Latino immigrant men living with HIV in New York City and Washington, DC. Physical function was measured using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Uncontrolled HIV infection and depression were associated with worse physical function, thus implying the importance of adequate health care to address these conditions. Preserving physical function should start during middle adulthood, particularly among people living with HIV because of their greater risk of developing age-related challenges such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases among others. This study informs future interventions to preserve physical function and achieve the goal of successful aging."
3377,0.006,6.0,"Osteoporosis is increasingly reported in the aging HIV-positive population, and co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) may further increase the risk of osteoporosis. However, it remains unclear whether HCV-related increased fracture risk is a function of the severity of liver disease. We calculated the time-updated alanine aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) score (an indirect marker of hepatic fibrosis) in all HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Veterans Affairs' Clinical Case Registry between 1984 and 2009. The association between HCV co-infection and incident osteoporotic fracture (defined as closed wrist, vertebral, or hip fracture) was assessed in univariate and multivariate Cox survival models adjusting for traditional risk factors for osteoporosis and APRI score or the presence of cirrhosis. A total of 772 osteoporotic fractures were identified among 56,660 HIV-infected patients (98.1% male; 31.3% HCV co-infected; median age 44.0 years) contributing 305,237 patient-years of follow-up. Fracture rates were significantly higher among HIV/HCV patients than HIV-only patients (2.57 versus 2.07/1000 patient-years, relative risk = 1.24, p < 0.0001). In a Cox multivariable model including age, race, smoking, drug use, body mass index, and antiretroviral therapy, HCV co-infection remained an independent predictor of osteoporotic fractures after controlling for presence of cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.32; p <0.001) or APRI score (HR = 1.30; p = 0.003). Among HIV/HCV co-infected patients, cirrhosis strongly predicted osteoporotic fractures (HR = 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-2.44; p = 0.012), but APRI score was a weaker predictor (HR = 1.008; 95% CI 1.002-1.014; p = 0.015). In conclusion, among HIV-infected patients, severity of liver disease partly explains the HCV-associated increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Other determinants of this increased risk remain to be defined."
8178,0.006,6.0,"In the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART), liver disease has emerged as an important cause of death among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. The objective of this study was to estimate the burden of liver disease and evaluate determinants of liver fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity among HIV/HCV coinfected patients receiving ART. We studied 112 randomly selected and 98 referred HCV-infected patients undergoing care in the Johns Hopkins University HIV clinic. Liver disease was characterized clinically and histologically. Of the 210 individuals studied--64% of whom had received ART within 2 years of liver disease assessment--33% had no fibrosis (F0), and 26% had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (> or =F3). The median necroinflammatory activity score was 3 (range, 0-9 of 18). ART was not associated with fibrosis; however, significantly less hepatic necroinflammatory activity was observed among persons who had received highly active antiretroviral therapy longer (P = .02) and more effectively (defined by HIV RNA suppression; P < .01). Twelve percent of individuals had previous ART-associated liver enzyme elevations (grades 3-4), but liver fibrosis was not more severe if the liver enzyme elevation resolved. On the other hand, liver fibrosis was more severe in persons with persistent liver enzyme elevations (grades 1-4). In conclusion, despite widespread exposure to ART and documented instances of ART-related hepatitis, we found no evidence that ART caused serious histological liver disease. Recognition of bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis in some but not most patients underscores the importance of identifying and treating liver disease in HIV/HCV coinfected persons."
7356,0.006,6.0,"The characteristics of intra-host human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) env evolution were evaluated in untreated HIV-1-infected subjects with different patterns of disease progression, including 2 normal progressor [NP], and 5 Long term non-progressor [LTNP] patients. High-resolution phylogenetic analysis of the C2-C5 env gene sequences of the replicating HIV-1 was performed in sequential samples collected over a 3-5 year period; overall, 301 HIV-1 genomic RNA sequences were amplified from plasma samples, cloned, sequenced and analyzed. Firstly, the evolutionary rate was calculated separately in the 3 codon positions. In all LTNPs, the 3rd codon mutation rate was equal or even lower than that observed at the 1st and 2nd positions (p = 0.016), thus suggesting strong ongoing positive selection. A Bayesian approach and a maximum-likelihood (ML) method were used to estimate the rate of virus evolution within each subject and to detect positively selected sites respectively. A great number of N-linked glycosylation sites under positive selection were identified in both NP and LTNP subjects. Viral sequences from 4 of the 5 LTNPs showed extensive positive selective pressure on the CD4-binding site (CD4bs). In addition, localized pressure in the area of the IgG-b12 epitope, a broad neutralizing human monoclonal antibody targeting the CD4bs, was documented in one LTNP subject, using a graphic colour grade 3-dimensional visualization. Overall, the data shown here documenting high selective pressure on the HIV-1 CD4bs of a group of LTNP subjects offers important insights for planning novel strategies for the immune control of HIV-1 infection."
1910,0.006,6.0,"Few empirical studies have evaluated the mediating effects of quality of life (QoL) among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The purposes of this study were to identify the predictors of QoL and to test the mediating effects of social support on depression and QoL among patients enrolled in an HIV case-management program in Taiwan. A cross-sectional, descriptive correlation design collected data from 108 HIV-infected individuals. Individuals were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II, the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support between September 2007 and April 2010. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (including age, gender, and mode of transmission) and clinical information (including CD4 count and time since diagnosis with HIV), the study findings showed that QoL was significantly and positively correlated with both social support and the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and was negatively correlated with depression and time since diagnosis with HIV. The strongest predictors for QoL were depression followed by the initiation of HAART and social support, with an R(2) of 0.40. Social support partially mediated the relationship between depression and QoL. Health professionals should enhance HIV-infected individuals' social support to alleviate the level of depression and further increase the QoL among PLWHA."
4794,0.006,6.0,"Treatment strategies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive active injecting drug users (IDUs) must take into account their lifestyles, that often result in low adherence to therapy. The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) offer simpler treatment regimens, but the appearance of drug resistance during treatment failure may cause high levels of cross-resistance to all NNRTIs. We adopted a combination therapy of two NRTIs and nevirapine (NVP) for treatment of IDU patients to evaluate its feasibility in such patients. From October 1998 to December 1999, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 80 IDUs on this regimen were collected. Fisher's exact test, Kaplan Meier method, and Cox model were used for statistical analysis. Overall, 20 IDUs discontinued the treatment because of side effects and 20 IDUs experienced treatment failure. Considering the treatment failure as an end point, 55.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.9%-72.6%) of patients was still undergoing treatment after 12 months compared to 44.6% (31.8%-58.6%) when discontinuation was also taken into account. An increasing trend over time was observed in the CD4+ lymphocyte count, among failing and nonfailing IDUs. By multivariate analysis, baseline HIV-RNA, treatment breaks and low adherence and active injecting drug use turned out to be significantly associated with treatment failure. Our results show that continuing injecting drug use and treatment breaks are the main factors that can lead to treatment failure in IDUs and easily to NNRTI class resistance."
255,0.006,6.0,"A patient with HIV infection developed the first episode of AIDS-defining opportunism (severe Candida albicans esophagitis) with an underlying CD4+ lymphocyte count of 1,025 cells/microL. After treatment with a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), taken with insufficient compliance and leaving a residual viral load, our patient suffered from two relapses of esophageal candidiasis, which occurred three months and seven years later, when his CD4+ lymphocyte count was 930 and 439 cells/microL, respectively, and a viral load slightly above 10(4) copies/mL was still present. Also in the HAART era, Candida esophagitis remains one of the most common AIDS-defining diseases, but a presentation with a concurrent CD4+ count above 1,000 cells/microL remains a rare exception, as well as the two isolated, subsequent relapses, occurred with a CD4+ count ranging from 439 to 930 cells/microL, and a residual HIV viremia due to insufficient adherence to the prescribed HAART regimens. Our case report represents the opportunity to revisit the epidemiology and, especially, the pathogenesis of this opportunistic fungal complication in HIV-infected patients and in other subjects at risk, on the ground of an extensive literature review, and to explore possible alternative supporting factors other than the crude absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count, with emphasis on the possible role of a persisting HIV viremia, and other potential contributing factors. Clinicians engaged with immunocompromised patients and subjects with HIV disease, should be aware that a Candida esophagitis may occur and relapse also when the cell-mediated immunity, as measured by a simple CD4+ cell count, do not show relevant abnormalities."
896,0.006,6.0,"In February and in June 1998, two people developed acute hepatitis B following in-patient care in a district general hospital. Initial enquiries indicated their infections were not attributable to staff undertaking exposure-prone procedures (EPPs). We report the findings and implications of the subsequent investigation: a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency investigation, including molecular epidemiological analysis. Occupational Health records showed that staff involved in EPPs with the patients were HBsAg negative. No contact between the patients was identified nor were there failures in sterilization. The patients' HBV strains were identical, indicating a common source. A total of 231 out of 232 staff who might have treated either patient were tested for HBsAg; the remaining doctor, working abroad, was HBsAg- and HBeAg-positive and had the same HBV strain as the patients. On two occasions the doctor's hand had been cut while breaking glass vials, but there was no documentation linking these events to the two patients. The doctor had been vaccinated in 1993 and tested for anti-HBs prior to commencing work in 1997. The doctor was recalled to Occupational Health but did not attend and was not followed up. In total, 4948 patients potentially treated by the doctor received an explanatory letter and 3150 were tested for HBsAg. Only one was positive, and HBV sequencing showed no link to the doctor. Occasionally transmission of HBV from heath-care workers can occur in a non-EPP setting and the implications of this require examination by those setting national policy. Occupational Health Services should investigate clinical heath-care workers who do not respond to vaccination. They should ensure HBV carriers are identified and offer them appropriate advice to prevent transmission to patients."
2510,0.006,6.0,"HIV-2 infection is confined mostly to West Africa. Seven HIV-2 subtypes have so far been described; only HIV-2 subtypes A and B are prevalent, the others being considered self-limiting infections at the epidemiological level. The main limitation for the HIV-2 DNA proviral quantification is the lack of HIV-2 DNA standard. We designed and tested a new HIV-2 primer couple that amplifies both the HIV-2 ROD strain and HIV-1 LAV/BRU strain. These HIV-2 primers were used to quantified an HIV-2 standard comparatively to a standard widely used in proviral DNA HIV-1 quantification, i.e., the 8E5 cell line transfected by a single defective integrated provirus of HIV-1 BRU/LAV by cell. The primers and probe used to quantify HIV-2 DNA are located in a long terminal repeat (LTR) region with low variability. These primers amplify both HIV-2 subtypes A and B. The relevance of the follow-up of the infected patients by the quantification of the proviral DNA HIV-2 is currently studied."
8861,0.006,6.0,"In 1994, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) recommended the use of zidovudine (ZDV) to reduce perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission; in 1995, USPHS recommended universal prenatal HIV counseling and voluntary testing. Widespread implementation of these recommendations, together with increased use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and scheduled cesarean delivery, has resulted in substantial declines in perinatal HIV transmission. However, perinatal HIV transmission continues to occur. To identify missed prevention opportunities, CDC analyzed the incidence of perinatal HIV infection among a cohort of HIV-exposed infants born during 1997-2000 at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, Georgia. This report describes the results of that analysis and underscores the challenges to universal prevention of infant HIV infections. Efforts to reduce perinatal HIV transmission should focus on increasing prenatal care rates, promoting adherence to recommended treatment regimens during pregnancy, and increasing prenatal HIV testing, particularly in areas where missed opportunities for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission persist."
6098,0.006,6.0,"We carried out a cross-sectional survey in Shiraz to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 1 444 individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We also determined the risk factors for this coinfection. Demographic and behavioural data were obtained using a standard questionnaire. The prevalence of HIV-HCV coinfection was 78.4% (95% CI: 76.3-80.5). Intravenous drug use (OR = 7.2; 95% CI: 4.9-10.6), imprisonment (OR = 6.9; 95% CI: 4.6-10.4), tattooing in prison (OR = 2.61; 95% CI: 1.4-4.8), tattooing out of prison (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.3-3.1) and age (OR = 1.02 with increasing each year of life; 95% CI: 1.0-1.04) were significantly associated with HCV-HIV coinfection. Prevalence of HCV-HIV coinfection is high in Shiraz. Intravenous drug use and imprisonment are the main risk factors for this coinfection. Therefore, serious implementation of HIV and HCV testing, education, prevention, care and treatment programmes and evaluation of harm reduction programmes in prisons are very important."
4476,0.006,6.0,"Retroviral genomes with a high frequency of G-->A mutations are thought to originate during reverse transcription (RT). Here we present a case report of an AIDS patient infected with a subtype F variant where extensive G-->A hypermutation (G-->A Hypm) sequences were found in the protease gene. This patient was failing HAART at the time the hypermutation was found. These sequences were basically encountered in the proviral compartment on two occasions and were persistently absent in the plasma viral population. The patient's viral genotype showed several mutations related to antiretroviral drug resistance in RT (T69N, M184V, T215F, K219Q) and protease (M36I, G48V, I54V, T63L, V82A) genes. The drug regimen was changed and the viral load dropped 0.9 Logs and CD4 count increased by 200 cells/ml. The hypermutation was not found any more in a 1-year follow up. The patient's wife was infected with a similar virus strain and G-->A Hypm sequences were also detected in the RT gene. This is the first report of sexual transmitted G-->A Hypermutation in HIV-1 and suggest that this phenomenon can be genetically coded by the viral RT molecule."

3307,0.006,6.0,"During the last 5 years, considerable scientific and financial efforts have been made in the development of quantitative nucleic acid detection technology. For detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), quantitative culture is time consuming, cumbersome and requires appropriate laboratory safety equipment. Quantitative determination of p24 antigen by enzyme immunoassay is of limited value due to its relatively poor sensitivity. Therefore, quantitative determination of viral load using nucleic acid amplification techniques is the most accurate, prognostic marker for HIV type 1 infection, independently of the CD4+ cell count. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is not cultivable in vitro. Serological assays allow an accurate diagnosis and follow-up of acute or chronic infection. Quantification of HBV DNA is used for the monitoring of antiviral therapy, determination of infectivity and for resolution of unclear serological profiles, e.g. isolated anti-HBc reactivity, as well as for patients in which HBV mutants are suspected. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can only be detected by molecular based assays because no cell culture system, which permits a reliable isolation of clinical specimens, is currently available. Furthermore, early diagnosis and follow-up of infection cannot be achieved with antibody serology. The prognostic relevance of quantitative HCV RNA determination is of limited value for the long-term prognosis of chronic hepatitis C. However, viral load may predict the outcome of antiviral therapy. Genetic diversity is another challenge for HCV RNA quantification."
9090,0.006,6.0,"A synthetic peptide, RPI 312, that specifically inhibits the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) showed a potent inhibition on virus production, maturation, and infectivity. Treatment with this agent prevented the cleavage of Gag protein at the site between p17 and p24 in HIV-1 chronically infected MOLT-4 cells as well as in the released virus. Passage of HIV-1 in the presence of gradually increasing concentrations of this protease inhibitor resulted in emergence of a variant that could evade the drug effects. In the resistant variant the maturation of Gag proteins appeared normal, but its infectivity was reduced compared with that of the parent virus. The nucleotides coding the amino acids at and around the cleavage site between Gag proteins p17 and p24 were not changed. One point mutation (A-->G) at site 2082 of the pol gene that resulted in one amino acid change at site 84 of the protease from isoleucine to valine (I-84-->V) could be detected in the resistant variant. An HIV-1 infectious DNA clone with the I-84-->V mutation also showed reduced sensitivity to this protease inhibitor. The findings that the resistant variant had lower infectivity and was still affected by higher doses of the drug support the speculation that resistance to protease inhibitors may not be as problematic as other drug resistance."
5432,0.006,6.0,"Clinical observation shows pregnant women under antiretroviral therapy present bleeding episodes at delivery, although this therapy promotes a decrease in fibrinolysis in nonpregnant patients, suggesting a prothrombotic state in the former. Since these drugs provoke hepatic disorders, they can cause bleeding disturbances. We investigated effects of antiretroviral therapy on hemostasis in pregnant women. Two groups were studied: pregnant women with HIV (n = 11), and (control) pregnant women without HIV (n = 7). Four blood samples were collected from each individual in both groups: one at the beginning of pregnancy before treatment, two during pregnancy and therapy, and one 6 weeks after delivery. Treatment was performed according to recommendations of the Brazilian Health Department for the evaluation of the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, factors VII, X, and XII, fibrinogen concentration, protein C, protein S, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and fibrin degradation products (FbDPs). Statistical analysis demonstrated pregnancy caused increased factor VII (P = 0.0313), factor X (P = 0.0156) and factor XII (P = 0.0156) activity, fibrinogen concentration (P = 0.0156), t-PA (P = 0.0313), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (P = 0.0156) and FbDP levels (P = 0.0313). HIV infection caused increased factor XII (P = 0.0114), t-PA (P = 0.0346) and FbDPs (P = 0.0003), and decreased protein S levels (P = 0.0441). Antiretroviral therapy reduced the activated partial thromboplastin time (P = 0.0114) and protein S (P = 0.0012), and increased t-PA (P = 0. 0204) and FbDP levels (P = 0.0154). The results suggest a prothrombic state developing during pregnancy, maintenance of hemostatic equilibrium in HIV infection and occurrence of hyperfibrinolysis, not due to hepatotoxicity, during antiretroviral therapy, causing the clinically observed bleeding episodes."
4844,0.006,6.0,"A major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 infection is the presence of a pool of long-lived, latently infected CD4+ memory T-cells. The search for treatments to re-activate latent HIV to aid in clearance is hindered by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that lead to transcriptional silencing of viral gene expression in host cells. Here we identify a previously unknown role for RUNX1 in HIV-1 transcriptional latency. The RUNX proteins, in combination with the co-factor CBF-β, are critical transcriptional regulators in T-cells. RUNX1 strongly modulates CD4 expression and contributes to CD4+ T-cell function. We show that RUNX1 can bind DNA sequences within the HIV-1 LTR and that this binding represses transcription. Using patient samples we show a negative correlation between RUNX1 expression and viral load. Furthermore, we find that pharmacologic inhibition of RUNX1 by a small molecule inhibitor, Ro5-3335, synergizes with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) to enhance the activation of latent HIV-1 in both cell lines and PBMCs from patients. Our findings indicate that RUNX1 and CBF-β cooperate in cells to modulate HIV-1 replication, identifying for the first time RUNX1 as a cellular factor involved in HIV-1 latency. This work highlights the therapeutic potential of inhibitors of RUNX1 to re-activate virus and aid in clearance of HIV-1. "
4789,0.006,6.0,"Two very rare case reports of bladder transitional cell carcinoma associated with HIV infection in patients treated with combined antiretroviral therapy are described, and discussed on the ground of the most relevant and updated literature resources. Only 13 cases of vesical carcinoma have been reported to date in the setting of HIV infection, but only 3 anecdotal single reports (the last in the y 2001) described clinical, therapeutic, and outcome issues of this rare disease association in some detail. In our patients, micro- or macro-haematuria was the clue for in-depth diagnosis and prompt treatment, which was limited to multiple local interventions in 1 case, but finally required a radical cystectomy in the second patient. No relationship was found with the very favourable underlying HIV-related virological and immunological status, and the present 8-12-month follow-up did not show disease relapses."
6193,0.006,6.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants may either emerge in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) as a result of positive selection pressure exerted by their own immune response, or during therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). Naturally occurring HBV variants with primary antiviral resistance are rarely observed. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the (eventual) circulation of HBV variants with natural resistance to NAs currently used as therapy for CHB in Argentina. This study reports 13 cases of CHB-infected patients with natural antiviral resistance to at least one NA. Five of them were also carriers of S-variants that might escape the humoral immune system recognition with potential resistance to adefovir. In addition to the already reported A2 HBV subgenotype association to NAs natural resistance, E and F genotypes association to such resistance is described for the first time. These findings suggest that sequence analysis of the HBV reverse transcriptase might be an essential tool before starting antiviral therapy, in order to choose the proper NAs for optimizing the therapeutic management of chronically infected patients. Moreover, the circulation and transmission of S-mutants with resistance to such antiviral drugs should be of public health concern as they may represent an additional risk for the community."
9895,0.006,6.0,"Previous studies have suggested that hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants may account for the presence of HBV DNA in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative patients (occult HBV infection). However, it is not known how widespread these variants are and how they influence the course of liver disease. To determine the prevalence of variants within the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBsAg, we investigated 2,565 subjects, including subjects with chronic hepatitis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hemodialysis patients, and blood donors. Fifty-one of them had occult HBV infection. The entire S gene from 46 of these patients was sequenced from amplified serum HBV DNA. Forty-three percent (20 of 46) had mutations in the MHR of HBsAg. Thirty-two amino acid substitutions between positions 100-160 of the MHR of HBsAg were detected in 18 patients, and these ranged from 1 to 4 per patient. These changes involved 11 positions inside and 5 outside of the historical first and second loops of the ""a"" determinant, and included the following: Q101K, T115A, K122N, T123A, T126N, Q129N, G130R, T131I, M133T, F134L, C138Y, K141E, P142S, G145R, N146S, and C147F/R. Combinations of mutations were detected in 9 patients, and 7 of these have not been described before. Two further patients had insertion mutations immediately before the ""a"" determinant. Monoclonal antibody binding tests with the Royal Free hepatitis B surface (RFHBs) panel of antibodies revealed decreased immunoreactivity in 6 novel variants of HBsAg. The existence of patients with occult HBV infection caused by HBsAg variants, therefore, has implications for their possible transmission through sexual contact and by blood transfusion."
5087,0.006,6.0,"Live virus vaccines can cause serious adverse reactions when administered to immunocompromised patients. Because children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be immunosuppressed, immunization of these children with live virus vaccines is a potential problem. A retrospective survey was conducted by the New York City Department of Health, with consultation from the Centers for Disease Control, to evaluate the frequency of serious adverse events following receipt of live vaccines among children with HIV infection receiving pediatric care in New York City and New Jersey. Outpatient records of 319 children being cared for by 16 participating physicians were reviewed. Of the 319 charts, 221 (69%) contained vaccination histories. Perinatal transmission of HIV infection was suspected for 208 (94%) of the 221 cases and infection via transfusion for the remaining 13 (6%). Of the 221 for whom immunization histories were available, 180 (81%) had received at least one dose of live oral polio vaccine and 70 (32%) had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. There were 120 children for whom a temporal relationship between immunization and onset of symptoms of immunodeficiency could be seen; 46/120 had received at least one dose of oral polio vaccine and 23/45 had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine after onset of symptoms. Although follow-up of this population has been limited, there were no reports of serious adverse events such as typical or atypical measles, paralytic poliomyelitis, or aseptic meningitis in the month following vaccination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5413,0.006,6.0,The increasing impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the health care delivery system requires surveillance of current patterns of HIV-related health care utilization to adequately plan for future needs.

1408,0.006,6.0,"RNA virus population dynamics are complex, and sophisticated approaches are needed in many cases for therapeutic intervention. One such approach, termed lethal mutagenesis, is directed at targeting the virus population structure for extinction or error catastrophe. Previous studies have demonstrated the concept of this approach with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by use of chemical mutagens [i.e., 5-azacytidine (5-AZC)] as well as by host factors with mutagenic properties (i.e., APOBEC3G). In this study, these two unrelated mutagenic agents were used concomitantly to investigate the interplay of these distinct mutagenic mechanisms. Specifically, an HIV-1 was produced from APOBEC3G (A3G)-expressing cells and used to infect permissive target cells treated with 5-AZC. Reduced viral infectivity and increased viral mutagenesis were observed with both the viral mutagen (i.e., G-to-C mutations) and the host restriction factor (i.e., G-to-A mutations); however, when combined, they had complex interactions. Intriguingly, nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that concomitant HIV-1 exposure to both 5-AZC and A3G resulted in an increase in G-to-A viral mutagenesis at the expense of G-to-C mutagenesis. A3G catalytic activity was required for the diminution in G-to-C mutagenesis. Taken together, our findings provide the first demonstration for potentiation of the mutagenic effect of a cytosine analog by A3G expression, resulting in concomitant HIV-1 lethal mutagenesis."
2549,0.006,6.0,"The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection and risk factors associated to it. Three hundred sixty-one HBsAg chronic carriers from southern Italy were studied and 13.8% of them resulted anti-delta positive. 80% of these subjects were less than 50 years old. When anti-delta positive subjects were compared with anti-delta negative ones, a lower number of healthy HDV carriers and a higher frequency of cirrhotics were noted among anti-delta positive. Of lower than 50 years, imprisonment, sexual contacts with drug abusers and male homosexuality were risk factors of HDV infection. No association was found with sex, household contacts with HBV or HDV carriers, number of family members and transfusion of blood products. These data confirm the high prevalence of HDV infection in southern Italy."
1020,0.006,6.0,"In addition to development or selection of resistance, failure to continuously suppress HIV-1 production while still using initially effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) may result from super-infection with a drug-resistant strain. Both transmission of drug resistant HIV and super-infection have been demonstrated. We analysed HIV pol genes obtained before start of initially successful cART and during failure while still on cART in 101 patients. Difference in precART and cART failure sequences were explained by evolution and not by super-infection."
9396,0.006,6.0,"Recent studies have shown that a single-nucleotide polymorphism upstream of the interleukin-28B (IL28B) gene plays a major role in predicting therapeutic response in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin. We sought to investigate the mechanism of the IL28B polymorphism, specifically as it relates to early HCV viral kinetics, IFN pharmacokinetics, IFN pharmacodynamics, and gene expression profiles. Two prospective cohorts (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected) completing treatment with IFN/ribavirin were enrolled. Patients were genotyped at the polymorphic site rs12979860. In the HIV/HCV cohort, frequent serum sampling was completed for HCV RNA and IFN levels. DNA microarray of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and individual expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were quantified on IFN therapy. The IL28B-favorable (CC) genotype was associated with improved therapeutic response compared with unfavorable (CT or TT) genotypes. Patients with a favorable genotype had greater first- and second-phase viral kinetics (P = 0.004 and P = 0.036, respectively), IFN maximum antiviral efficiency (P = 0.007) and infected cell death loss (P = 0.009) compared with unfavorable genotypes. Functional annotation analysis of DNA microarray data was consistent with depressed innate immune function, particularly of natural killer cells, from patients with unfavorable genotypes (P <0.004). Induction of innate immunity genes was also lower in unfavorable genotypes. ISG expression at baseline and induction with IFN was independent of IL28B genotype."
6042,0.006,6.0,"Increased concentrations of neopterin, a marker for cell-mediated immune activation, and decreased numbers of CD4+ T cells, are predictors for progression of disease after infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Previous studies have demonstrated different rates of onset of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) for groups of patients, defined by laboratory marker values, who were initially symptom-free. By re-analysis of one such study, we demonstrate how for an individual patient, the individual marker values, together with a prior risk estimate, can be converted into current or accumulated post-test probability of onset of AIDS at a certain time. We used a statistical technique suggested by Albert et al. (Clin Chem 1984;30:69-76), which allows incorporation of fixed and time-dependent covariates. Besides allowing individual projections, the method shows that the predictive abilities of CD4+ T cell numbers and of neopterin concentrations do not vary greatly with regard to time of observation; both laboratory markers independently modulate the underlying prior probability of AIDS onset, which is significantly increased with the passage of time."
6181,0.006,6.0,"Maraviroc (Pfizer's UK-427857, Selzentry or Celsentri outside the USA) is the first agent in the new class of oral HIV-1 entry inhibitors to acquire approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency. Considering the mechanism of action, it is expected that this drug will be effective only in a subpopulation of HIV-1-infected people, namely those harbouring the R5 virus. The favourable toxicity profile of the drug has been demonstrated in Phase III clinical trials in treatment-naive (MERIT) and treatment-experienced (MOTIVATE) patients. In the latter population, maraviroc showed a superior antiviral efficacy and immunological activity compared with optimized backbone therapy + placebo. However, in MERIT, a prospective double-blind, randomized trial in treatment-naive patients, maraviroc + zidovudine/lamivudine failed to prove non-inferiority to efavirenz + zidovudine/lamivudine as standard of care regimen in the 48 week intention-to-treat analysis. Using an assay with higher sensitivity for minority CXCR4-using (X4) HIV variants (the enhanced Trofile assay-Monogram), non-inferiority was reached for the maraviroc- versus efavirenz-based combination. These data indicate the important impact of the sensitivity of tropism testing on treatment outcome of maraviroc-containing regimens. This paper discusses both the prospective and retrospective analyses of the MERIT data and highlights the impact of these results on daily practice in HIV care."
3793,0.006,6.0,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are among the major public health challenges in Cameroon. This paper determined the effect of men's sex-related behaviors and HIV knowledge on reported STIs. The data came from the 2012 Cameroon's Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) that were collected from 7191 respondents in 2012. Descriptive and logistic regression methods were used for data analysis. Results showed that majority of the respondents were aware of STIs and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), while 3.96% reported STIs. Also, 49.45% of the men had no wife, while 75.58% and 84.58% noted that condoms and keeping of one partner could be used to prevent HIV transmission, respectively. Wrong impressions that mosquito bites and sharing of food could lead to HIV infection were held by 31.94% and 12.44% of the men, respectively. Among those that reported STIs, 33.33%, 30.18% and 13.33% respectively used condom during sex with most recent partner, second to most recent partner and third to most recent partner, compared to 24.69%, 15.04% and 4.17% among those that did not report STIs. Logistic regression results showed that probability of STI increased significantly (p < 0.05) with condom use with third most recent partners, being married, wrong knowledge that mosquito bites cause HIV and being away for more than one month, while it significantly reduced (p < 0.05) with number of children, knowledge that having one partner prevents STIs. It was concluded that policy initiatives and programmes to enhance right sexual knowledge and behavior among men would go a long way in reducing STI incidence in Cameroon."
9188,0.006,6.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates from Iranian patients around the country were characterized. Eighty-one complete genomes from HBV isolates were sequenced and analyzed. The studied population was grouped into three categories including inactive carriers, patients with chronic hepatitis, and patients with liver cirrhosis. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses revealed that Iranian patients were infected with HBV genotype D and subgenotype D1. The most common subtype was ayw2, followed by ayw3 and ayw4. Several deletions and insertions that had no correlation with disease outcome were observed in the HBV genomes. The most frequent mutation in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was sP120S. Almost half of the patients studied carried precore (PC) mutant variants and one-third of the studied population was infected with variants carrying basal core promoter (BCP) mutations. PC and BCP mutations were observed in older patients, especially in those with chronic liver disease. Sixty-seven patients (82.7%) were HBeAg negative, and the prevalence of precore mutant isolates (G1896A) was higher in this group than in HBeAg-positive patients. Lamivudine drug resistance mutations were detected after 1 year of treatment in about 30% of lamivudine-treated patients. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that HBV subgenotype D1 is the only subgenotype circulating in Iran, and there is no evidence of any exotic genotype in the region. The HBV PC (G1896A) mutation may play an important role in the clinical outcome of the disease by increasing the risk of progressive liver disease among Iranian patients infected with HBV."
9487,0.006,6.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is one of the most prominent health care challenges world wide. In Western industrialized countries where common access to antiretroviral drugs exists, HIV infection is a well treatable disease in the long-term for most patients. However, given the possible evolution of drug-resistance, the right combination of antiretroviral drugs in first-line therapy is crucial for maintaining long-term success. For each individual patient, the ideal time to start antiretroviral therapy must be carefully selected. The individual risk of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on the one hand, and the risks of long-term toxicity and adherence problems under therapy on the other hand must be taken into account. Each patient should be counseled according to present treatment guidelines on when and how to start HAART, taking into account the surrogate markers CD4-cell count and HIV-RNA as well as clinically apparent HIV-associated disease."
5434,0.006,6.0,"Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was used to characterize the precore region of HBV from Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis. Two types of mutually exclusive variants were found in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative patients. The first (M1) contains a substitution from proline to serine at codon 15. A second group were infected with a previously described mutant (M2) containing a translational stop codon. HBeAg-positive patients were infected with the wild-type virus or the M1-containing strain. M2 emerged in patients with wild-type infection after seroconversion to anti-HBe, whereas M1 was present during the HBeAg-positive phase. In those with fluctuating HBe status, there was no correlation between prevailing HBe serology and sequence. There was an association between infection with variants and severe chronic hepatitis. Patients infected with strains containing M1 while HBeAg positive had a worse prognosis after seroconversion to anti-HBe."

4623,0.006,6.0,"Wasting remains a significant condition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection despite antiretroviral treatment. Early identification requires the measurement of various body composition parameters, particularly body cell mass (BCM). Anthropometry may provide some useful information. Cost and complexity issues make many body composition techniques unsuitable for the clinical setting. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) may be the best method available to caregivers for monitoring serial changes in BCM over time and for determining the occurrence of wasting. It is not useful, however, for detecting body composition changes in patients with fat redistribution syndromes. Portability, low cost, ease of use, and patient acceptance make anthropometry and BIA ideally suited for the clinical setting."
5566,0.006,6.0,"Early studies of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use in clinical practice suggested suboptimal rates of viral suppression. HAART regimens and expertise in the use of HAART have since evolved, and we sought to determine how virologic response to HAART has changed in clinical practice. We compared all patients who started a first HAART regimen from 1996 through 2002 in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected patients in care in Baltimore. There were significant improvements in suppressing HIV RNA to < 400 copies/mL, ranging from 43.8% (1996) to 72.4% (2001-2002) by 6 months and from 60.1% (1996) to 79.9% (2001-2002) by 12 months (both P < 0.01 for trend). There were also significant improvements in CD4 cell response. Over time, there was a significant increase in the use of a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen compared with a single PI as well as an increase in the number of patients who were antiretroviral (ARV) naive. There was also a significant temporal trend from 1996 through 2002 in achieving a suppressed HIV RNA level, adjusting for being ARV naive, specific HAART regimen, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, and demographic factors. This suggests that improved virologic response may also be attributable to other factors such as a greater focus on medication adherence, improved ARV tolerability, and ease of dosing."
5890,0.006,6.0,"We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of neopterin, a putative marker of activated macrophages, in 97 subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 who had a spectrum of neurological complications. The highest CSF neopterin concentrations occurred in those with neurological opportunistic infections, primary central nervous systems lymphoma, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex. In general, the CSF concentration of neopterin was independent of CSF cell count and blood-brain barrier disruption to albumin. In the patients with AIDS dementia complex, CSF neopterin concentrations correlated with severity of disease and decreased in conjunction with clinical improvement following treatment with zidovudine. These results suggest that CSF neopterin, although not disease-specific, may be useful as a surrogate marker for the presence of AIDS dementia complex and its response to antiviral therapy."
7023,0.006,6.0,"At least one-third of the 34 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide are infected with latent tuberculosis (TB). The aim of this study was to determine the rate of HIV infection in TB patients and its determinants in Wuxi City, China. TB patients attending health institutions (12 selected sites) for TB diagnosis and treatment were enrolled in this study. TB diagnosis, treatment and HIV testing were done according to the national guidelines. Blood samples were collected for anonymous HIV testing. Among the TB patients, the HIV prevalence was 13.66% (1493/10,926). Multivariate analysis showed that gender, age, education, marital status, per capita monthly income, patient residence, family size, distance from a health institution, knowledge of HIV-TB co-infection, and knowledge of HIV may be risk factors for HIV-TB co-infection (all: odds ratio > 1, p < 0.05). The prevalence of TB in those with HIV was higher among the study participants. Improving public awareness of HIV-TB co-infection, regularly screening and improving follow-up can reduce the occurrence of HIV-TB co-infection."
1433,0.006,6.0,"Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a possible treatment for acute or chronic liver failure due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but reinfection of the graft can be a serious complication. The aim of this study was to monitor HBV markers, to analyse pre-core-/core-mutations as well as to identify the viral population causing reinfection after OLT, and to investigate the emergence or disappearance of these mutants in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Fifty-four pre-and posttransplant serum samples of 17 patients were analysed. All patients underwent OLT for HBV-related liver disease and had HBV-DNA before and after OLT. Total DNA was extracted from all sera and a 240 bp fragment comprising the pre-core region of HBV was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pre-core mutants of HBV were determined by direct sequencing of these PCR products and by sequencing of PCR clones. Eight of 17 patients were infected with pre-core wildtype HBV before OLT (group A). Seven of eight patients of group A were reinfected by pre-core wildtype HBV after OLT. In one of eight patients in addition to wildtype HBV a mutant strain (nt. 1899 G-->A) was detected. Nine of 17 patients were infected with pre-core mutant HBV before OLT (group B). Six of nine patients of group B were reinfected with the same mutant population; in one, an additional pre-core mutation emerged; two patients lost pre-core mutant HBV (nt. 1896 and 1899 G-->A). In one of the latter two, a pre-core start-codon mutant (nt. 1816 G-->T), not detectable before OLT, emerged, in the other a nt. 1897 G-->A stop-codon mutant persisted. Five patients of each group were followed-up for more than 24 (25 to 58) months on immunosuppressive therapy. In all five patients of group A, pre-core wildtype of HBV persisted during long-term follow up. Two of five patients of group B were infected stably with a stop-codon HBV-mutant nt. 1896. In three patients, the nt. 1896 stop-codon mutant disappeared during immunosuppressive therapy. However, in one of the latter three, an HBV stop-codon mutant nt. 1897 persisted. In conclusion, most patients who underwent OLT for HBV-related disease were reinfected with the same virus population that existed before OLT. In rare cases, new mutants emerged after OLT or preexisting mutants were lost. During long-term follow-up on immunosuppressive therapy, in the majority of patients pre-core mutants disappeared and wildtype HBV became the predominant virus strain."
2450,0.006,6.0,"The risk for dental hygienists to contract HIV and hepatitis B infection at work was studied in an international cohort of 167 dental hygienists from 13 countries. A significant proportion of the hygienists had taken care of HIV-positive patients or patients known to be at risk for contracting HIV infection. None of the hygienists had antibodies to HIV. Five hygienists who came from or worked in high-endemic areas for hepatitis B infection had antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen, consistent with previous infection with hepatitis B virus. The study is in agreement with previous reports on blood-borne infections among health care workers, concluding that the risk for dental hygienists of contracting HIV and hepatitis B infection is minimal."
398,0.006,6.0,"Unmet needs for services, such as housing and psychiatric treatment, are relatively common among HIV-infected individuals; however, the effects of different types of unmet needs on health-care outcomes are not well understood. This study describes unmet psychosocial needs and their relationship with health-care outcomes among individuals receiving HIV care in the southeastern US (n=526). We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association of seven categories of unmet needs with HIV medication use and adherence. Most participants (84.5%) reported at least one service need in the past year. Nearly half (47%) of participants with service needs reported that at least one need was not met. Participants with one or more unmet needs were less likely to be taking any HIV medications (p = 0.007) and reported poorer medication adherence (p=0.013). The specific unmet needs for benefits (including Social Security, health insurance and prescription coverage) (p = 0.006) and a support group (p=0.040) were associated with being less likely to be taking any HIV medications. Unmet need for mental health-related counseling was associated with poorer medication adherence (p=0.003). Study findings regarding the high level of unmet need and the association of unmet need with poorer outcomes illustrate the importance of interventions to address these needs."
3943,0.006,6.0,"There is evidence that the life expectancy (LE) of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, mortality rates in recent years in HIV-positive individuals appear to have remained higher than would be expected based on rates seen in the general population. A low CD4 count, whether due to late HIV diagnosis, late initiation of cART, or incomplete adherence to cART, remains the dominant predictor of LE, and thus the individual's disease stage at initiation of cART (or thereafter) certainly contributes to these higher mortality rates. However, individuals with HIV also tend to exhibit lifestyles and behaviors that place them at increased risk of mortality, particularly from non-AIDS causes. Thus, although mortality rates among the HIV population may indeed remain slightly higher than those seen in the general population, they may be no higher than those seen in a more appropriately matched control group. Thus, further improvements in LE may now only be possible if some of the other underlying issues (for example, modification of lifestyle or behavioral factors) are tackled."
9306,0.006,6.0,"The treatment costs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients continue to rise as patients survive longer because of advances in antiretroviral therapy and effective chemoprophylaxis. Medication costs per patient increase in proportion to progressive immunodeficiency. We retrospectively studied medication costs for 196 HIV-infected patients with stratification by CD4-lymphocyte count. Medication costs per patient-month were correlated with CD4-lymphocyte count (linear regression, r = -.53, P < 0.01), with higher costs associated with lower CD4 counts. The medication cost for patients with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3 averaged $1043 per month. Medication costs per patient increase with the development of each new opportunistic infection or other AIDS-associated condition. Costs can be expected to increase as new therapeutic agents are introduced, as treatment is initiated at earlier stages of HIV infection, and as more patients survive to the point of severe CD4-lymphocyte depletion."

7308,0.006,6.0,"Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used in a rural hospital of Cameroon to assess how much nursing personnel know about and practise in regard to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), and to determine health service factors that influence knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). Participants included 107 nursing and laboratory staff and 62 patients with AIDS. Self-administered questionnaires were used for nurses, and close-ended questionnaires were administered to patients with AIDS (as a verification tool for staff responses). Focus group discussions (FGD) held with nurse supervisors evaluated health service factors that influence KAP. Overall, 70.1% of the nurses who responded scored highly in the knowledge section compared to 50.5% in the attitude and practice section. There were several outstanding misconceptions and malpractices about HIV/AIDS. Knowledge, but not attitude, was significantly influenced by the grade of the staff (P< 0.001 and P = 0.17, respectively). Approximately 15% of 62 patients with AIDS indicated that they were attended to with signs of disgust and/or hatred. The major health service factors thought to influence KAP, confirmed by many in all the FGD, included: the lack of adequate information; the lack of commitment to alter attitudes and practices; the lack of in-service promotions; and the ongoing fear of becoming infected with the virus through caring for patients with AIDS. Low income also seemed to have an influence on KAP. Therefore, it is imperative that ongoing education programmes are provided for nurses to enable them to meet the needs of the increasing HIV prevalence in our community. Information, education and communication, and compliance with international working norms, remain essential tools in the control of HIV/AIDS spread in our hospital settings."

Pre-exposure hepatitis B vaccination and the use of standard precautions to prevent exposure to blood are the most effective strategies for preventing DHCP from occupational infection with HIV, HBV or HCV. Each dental health care facility should develop a comprehensive written program for preventing and managing occupational exposures to blood that: (1) describes the types of blood exposures that may place DHCP at risk for infection; (2) outlines procedures for promptly reporting and evaluating such exposures; and (3) identifies a health care professional who is qualified to provide counseling and perform all medical evaluations and procedures in accordance with the most current USPHS recommendations. Finally, resources should be available that permit rapid access to clinical care, testing, counseling, and PEP for exposed DHCP and the testing and counseling of source patients."

The study objective was to evaluate the quality of laboratory performance in testing for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibody. After identifying relevant variables in univariate analyses, multivariate analyses were performed using stepwise logistic models. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibody test performance was independently associated with analytic variables such as commercial test kit used and with nonanalytic variables such as experience, training, and degree requirements of laboratory personnel. These results validate the importance of nonanalytic variables to the quality of outcomes in laboratory testing."
4611,0.006,6.0,"In the United States, transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) from health care exposures has been considered uncommon. However, a review of outbreak information revealed 33 outbreaks in nonhospital health care settings in the past decade: 12 in outpatient clinics, 6 in hemodialysis centers, and 15 in long-term care facilities, resulting in 448 persons acquiring HBV or HCV infection. In each setting, the putative mechanism of infection was patient-to-patient transmission through failure of health care personnel to adhere to fundamental principles of infection control and aseptic technique (for example, reuse of syringes or lancing devices). Difficult to detect and investigate, these recognized outbreaks indicate a wider and growing problem as health care is increasingly provided in outpatient settings in which infection control training and oversight may be inadequate. A comprehensive approach involving better viral hepatitis surveillance and case investigation, health care provider education and training, professional oversight, licensing, and public awareness is needed to ensure that patients are always afforded basic levels of protection against viral hepatitis transmission."
1679,0.006,6.0,"The epidemic of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) poses a major ethical question: How can we control the epidemic and the harm that it causes without unjustly discriminating against particular social groups and without unnecessarily infringing on the freedom of individuals? This question pertains to three spheres of public policy in the United States: public health, the delivery of health care, and research. In the public health sphere, vigorous educational efforts will be required, as will modified approaches to intravenous drug use, prostitution, and homosexual and bisexual sexual activity. Carefully targeted, voluntary testing and screening programs should be coupled with counseling and with guarantees of confidentiality and nondiscrimination where these are appropriate. Both health care workers and the health care system have a moral obligation to provide care to people with HIV infection, but heroic self-sacrifice should not be required provided that infection control precautions are observed. Patients with neurological involvement and terminally ill patients will benefit from statutes allowing recognition of advance directives about preferred modes of care or nontreatment. There is a moral imperative to perform intensive research directed toward the understanding, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection and AIDS. The research process will raise challenging ethical questions."
6467,0.006,6.0,"A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate HIV seroprevalence among infectious (smear positive) cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and to describe the relation between antituberculosis drug resistance and infection with human immunodeficiency virus. A total of 418 smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients who attended the out patient departments of Harar Tuberculosis Centre and two general hospitals were studied from October 1994 through January 1995. The majority (94%) of these patients were from the tuberculosis centre. Sputum cultures were positive for 338/418 (80.9%) patients. HIV seroprevalence was 92/418 (22.0%) among smear positive and 69/338 (20.4%) among culture positive patients. HIV positive patients were more likely to be from urban than rural areas (p < 0.001). Initial resistance was not affected by HIV seropositivity. Secondary drug resistance was significantly higher in HIV positive patients than HIV negatives (p < 0.05). Although not significant, HIV positive patients were more defaulters than HIV negatives. Significantly higher numbers of HIV positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients were cases of relapse and treatment failure (p < 0.05). Other studies are required in order to assess the impact of HIV infection on the spread of anti-tuberculosis resistance. Supervised and appropriate treatments with follow up are required in order to minimise the spread of drug resistant tubercle bacilli among HIV infected patients."

Three out of 63 studied samples (4.8%) were positive in a qualitative test for total antibodies to HDV antigen. Five samples (7.9%) turned out to be HDV-RNA-positive by RT-PCR, four of them were sequenced in the region of L-HDAg, and phylogenetic analysis was performed. All four examined samples belonged to genotype I. Two RNA-positive/anti-HD-negative samples possessed a few uncommon nucleotide substitution sites within the L-HDAg sequence, which could suggest unique variants in the Polish population of HDV-infected patients."

Similar to previous reports of hyperthyroidism due to IRD, all of our patients experienced a rapid early recovery in total CD4 count, but developed symptoms of hyperthyroidism on average 3 years (38 months) after beginning cART, which represents a longer time frame than previously reported. Awareness and recognition of this potential complication of cART, which may occur years after treatment initiation, will allow patients with immune restorative hyperthyroidism to receive timely therapy and avoid the long-term complications associated with undiagnosed thyroid disease."
2286,0.006,6.0,"The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, is an important immunoregulatory hormone [1]. Its effects are exerted by interaction with the vitamin D receptor, which is present on human monocytes and activated T and B lymphocytes. Variation in the vitamin D receptor gene was typed in 2015 subjects from large case-control studies of three major infectious diseases: tuberculosis, malaria, and hepatitis B virus. Homozygotes for a polymorphism at codon 352 (genotype tt) were significantly underrepresented among those with tuberculosis (chi2=6.22, 1 df, P=. 01) and persistent hepatitis B infection (chi2=6.25, 1 df, P=.01) but not in subjects with clinical malaria compared with the other genotypes. Therefore, this genetic variant, which predisposes to low bone mineral density in many populations, may confer resistance to certain infectious diseases."

Between 2005 and 2009, we enrolled patients ≥ 18 years of age with suspected histoplasmosis at a hospital-based HIV clinic in Guatemala City. A case of suspected histoplasmosis was defined as a person presenting with at least three of five clinical or radiologic criteria.

4892,0.006,6.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an occupational risk of surgeons especially in developing countries where asymptomatic carrier rate is about 15%. Despite better knowledge about mode of transmission and methods of prevention including use of active immunization, it still remains a threat. In this study, a questionnaire survey of Nigerian surgeons was conducted to ascertain their knowledge, and immunization status against HBV infection. Our study showed a 9.3% incidence of clinical HBV infection, poor perception of risk of infection, poor local availability of vaccines, and low uptake where same was available. Reasons cited for non-immunization are lack of awareness, cost, inertia and non-availability of vaccines. Only 10.2% of our respondents always used barrier methods, and 77.7% of our respondents do not check the immune status of their patients after sustaining an intraoperative sharp injury. The overall level of knowledge about HBV infection was deemed poor. We conclude with recommendations on how to improve knowledge about HBV infection and uptake of vaccines."
8678,0.006,6.0,"The severe complications of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome represent the final phase of a prolonged course of immune system destruction during the infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Many of these complications can be predicted by measuring the depletion of CD4 positive lymphocytes. The CD4 positive lymphocyte counts are now widely accepted as a surrogate marker to assess the stage of disease and to determine immune response in major clinical trials. Other lymphocyte subsets are candidate surrogate markers for antiretroviral therapy. Our laboratory has utilized flow cytometry to perform lymphocyte subset testing, including CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8 ratio, and others for more than three years on persons with suspected immune deficiency. Results from our laboratory are presented to illustrate the use of these procedures in an urban, predominantly inner city population. The role of flow cytometry in monitoring patients with HIV infection is discussed."
6815,0.006,6.0,"This study aims to determine the relationship among cerebral metabolite concentrations (on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy or (1)H MRS), cognitive function, and clinical variables (CD4, plasma and CSF viral loads, and lipids) in antiretroviral medication-nai;ve HIV patients. We hypothesized that the probable glial markers myo-inositol [MI] and choline compounds [CHO] would correlate with cognitive function, CD4 count, and viral loads, but not with serum lipids. Forty-five antiretroviral-drug-nai;ve HIV patients and 25 control subjects were evaluated. Frontal lobe [MI], [CHO], and total creatine [CR] were elevated, while basal ganglia [CR] were decreased, with increasing dementia severity. As a group, HIV patients showed slowing on fine motor (Grooved Pegboard) and psychomotor function (Trails A & B), and deficits on executive function (Stroop tasks). Lower CD4 counts and elevated plasma viral loads were associated with elevated frontal white matter [MI], which in turn correlated with the Stroop tasks. These findings suggest that systemic factors (resulting from suppressed immune function and higher plasma viral load) may lead to glial proliferation (elevated [MI], [CHO], and [CR]) in the frontal white matter, which in turn may contribute to deficits on executive function in HIV. Studying antiretroviral-nai;ve patients minimized the confounding effects of antiretroviral treatment on the clinical, MRS, and neuropsychological variables, and allowed for a more accurate assessment of the relationships among these measurements. Metabolite concentrations, rather than metabolite ratios, should be measured since [CR], a commonly used reference for metabolite ratios, varies with disease severity in both frontal lobe and basal ganglia."

The frequency of drug resistance mutations (DRM) and the genetic variability of HIV-1 isolates from newly diagnosed HIV-infected pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics of the Lucrecia Paim and Augusto N'Gangula maternities, Luanda-Angola, were determined. Thirty five out of 57 samples (61.4%) were sequenced and one mutation associated with resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was detected. Additionally, two mutations associated with resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were also detected. No primary mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PI) were found. Subtypes A1, C, D, F1, G, H, CRF 13, CRF 37, and other mosaics were detected."

Health professionals conducted face-to-face interviews and collected data from patients' electronic medical records regarding patients' demographic, clinical, and medication information, as well as their social support and perceived health status. We classified all HIV/AIDS patients into HIV monoinfected and TB coinfected, at a ratio of 2:1.Compared with the HIV monoinfected, patients with HIV/TB coinfection were more likely to be older, male, less educated, unemployed, carrying health insurance, having advanced stage of HIV infection, longer history with HIV, and other opportunistic infections. Patients coinfected with TB were also more likely to hold a negative belief that their HIV treatment could prevent exacerbations, and reported significantly worse emotional/informational support, social interaction, and perceived health status. Better social support and better self-efficacy to the HIV treatment adherence was significantly associated with better perceived health status among patients with HIV and TB coinfection.Having HIV/TB coinfection was associated with poorer perceived general well-being and mental health, particularly in those undergoing TB therapy. Our findings suggest the need for mental health referrals and medication management for coinfected individuals, as well as further efforts and policies to improve coordinated care."
9567,0.005,5.0,"2346 liver samples from 17 areas in China were investigated for intrahepatic hepatitis D antigen (HDAg) by direct enzyme-labelled technique. HDAg was detected in 167 out of 1764 samples of HBsAg positive individuals with the detection rate of 9.47%. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection existed in all the examined areas without any significant difference regarding HDAg detection rate. A relationship of intrahepatic HDAg to the pathologic type of the liver disease was observed. The HDAg detection rate in chronic liver diseases and severe hepatitis was higher than in other liver diseases. It suggested that HDV infection was associated with the progression and chronicity of the liver disease. Studies on the relationship between HDV infection and HBV replication showed that HBV replication might be suppressed by HDV infection. Both HDV and HBV, however, could replicate in the same hepatocyte simultaneously."
5760,0.005,5.0,"Several of the common viral agents that can cause hepatitis have been detected in body fluids, including saliva and blood, which may both form important routes for transmission of disease. The viruses most commonly implicated include hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) can be found in persons positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and presumably follows the same routes of transmission as HBV. Herpes simplex and echo viruses can cause hepatitis on rare occasion. Other agents, not yet positively identified but collectively referred to as non-A, non-B are also believed to follow the same routes as HBV and/or HAV. The aim of this reviews is twofold. First, we will discuss hepatotropic viruses other than HBV that may be spread via saliva and blood and, therefore, should be considered along with HBV as a potential health hazard to dental personnel and also to dental patients. The second aim is to highlight the epidemiology and the risk of transmission of these viral infections. The potential hazards are discussed in relation to those associated with HBV and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), implicated in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)."
2722,0.005,5.0,": To date, the relation between the CD8 antiviral factor (CAF) and clinical indicators of disease progression in HIV-1 infection (CD4 T-cell counts and viral load [VL]) is inconclusive. Particularly, the effect of antiretroviral therapy and immune recovery on CAF production remains unclear. Using a transient transfection assay and a reporter gene activated by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), we analyzed CAF production in CD8 T cells of HIV-1-positive individuals divided into 3 groups: patients on protease inhibitor (PI)-based therapy, patients on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapy, and patients receiving no therapy. We found that within the untreated group, CAF activity inversely correlated with VL and high CAF was associated with lower VLs over a period of 0.5 to 3 years. Furthermore, patients who were drug-naive demonstrated significantly higher CAF than untreated patients who had previously undergone antiretroviral therapy. CAF activity in treated patients was similar to CAF in drug-naive patients and higher than in off-treatment patients. There seemed to be a trend toward higher CAF in patients on NNRTI-based therapy compared with those on PI-based therapy. These results suggest that immune recovery after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) contributes to the normalization of CAF levels in HIV-1-positive individuals. Furthermore, we have distinguished between CD8 T-cell-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication and gene transcription."
636,0.005,5.0,"Despite advances in antiretroviral therapy and in the treatment and prevention of opportunistic infections, oncological and consequent hematologic complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection continue to occur and are of significant clinical importance. Virus-related tumors (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma, induced by human herpesvirus 8; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, linked to Epstein-Barr virus; and anogenital tumors, linked to human papillomavirus) are frequent in patients with HIV-induced immune deficiency. The incidence of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma has declined among homosexual men, but this tumor remains problematic in many patients. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is 60 times more prevalent in HIV-positive persons than in others and typically presents as advanced-stage, high- or intermediate-grade B cell lymphoma, with frequent extranodal involvement. Primary central nervous system lymphoma is also common. Cervical carcinoma in HIV-positive women is also usually advanced at diagnosis. Anal carcinoma is increasing in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative populations. Chemotherapy for these tumors can result in dose-limiting cytopenia that can be well-controlled with hematopoietic growth factors, allowing patients to avoid transfusions and maintain the dose intensity of their chemotherapy regimens."
5894,0.005,5.0,"Approximately 1 million people are infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Malawi. Despite efforts aimed at changing individual risk behaviors, HIV prevalence continues to rise among rural populations. Both previous research and the Political Economy of Health framework suggest that community-based socio-economic factors and accessibility may influence HIV transmission; however, these community factors have received little empirical investigation. To fill this gap, this research uses data from a nationally representative probability sample of rural Malawians combined with small area estimates of community socio-economic and accessibility data in logistic regression models to: 1) reveal relationships between community factors and individual HIV status; 2) determine whether these relationships operate through individual HIV risk behaviors; and 3) explore whether these associations vary by gender. Community socio-economic factors include relative and absolute poverty; community accessibility factors include distance to roads, cities, and public health facilities. Individual HIV risk behaviors include reported condom use, sexually transmitted infections, multiple partnerships, and paid sex. Results show that higher community income inequality, community proximity to a major road, and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV for women. For men, community proximity to a major road and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV infection. These direct relationships between community factors and individual HIV status are not mediated by individual HIV risk behaviors. The Political Economy of Health frames the discussion. This study provides evidence for expanding HIV prevention efforts beyond individual risk behaviors to consideration of community factors that may drive the HIV epidemic in rural Malawi."

A convenience sample of 287 clients (220 men and 67 women) was given a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Overall, complementary therapy use was 31%. Patients who used complementary therapy were more likely to be white (O.R., 2.5), female (O.R. 3.3), a high school graduate (O.R. 2.9), and to know another complementary therapy user (O.R. 7.8). Age, sexual orientation, CD4 cell count, injection drug use, living with another HIV-infected person, having pain, and HIV support group membership were not associated. Men were more likely than women, and whites were more likely than nonwhites, to use vitamins/minerals, imagery/meditation, and dietary regimens. Nonwhites were more likely than whites, and women more likely than men, to use spiritual healing. Of those using complementary therapy, men were more likely than women, and whites more likely than nonwhites, to get information about complementary therapy from HIV organizations, friends, and homosexual-oriented media. Doctors and nurses were the most frequently cited source of complementary therapy information for women. Frequency, type of therapies used, and source of information about complementary therapy among HIV-infected persons vary by race and gender. Clinicians should be educated about complementary therapies so that they can provide information to their patients and be aware of self-treatment behavior."
3966,0.005,5.0,"Assiduous measures are taken to prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to infants; it is unclear whether the mothers receive appropriate care for their chronic HBV. We sought to assess the quality of HBV care in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers following pregnancy. HBsAg-positive women (n = 243) who had sought prenatal care at Massachusetts General Hospital were retrospectively identified and charts reviewed. The primary outcome was adherence to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines. Over one-third (37%) of women were first diagnosed with HBV infection at a prenatal visit. One-third (32%) did not undergo timely liver function test measurements. HBV DNA was never measured in 26% and was untimely in 34% of patients. One-third (34%) of the women were at high-risk for HCC based on AASLD criteria, yet only 33% of these women underwent timely imaging. Nearly half (49%) never saw a liver specialist for their HBV care. In multivariate analysis, women were 3.7 times more likely to have a timely ALT and 8.1 times more likely to have a timely HBV DNA if they were followed by a liver specialist (P = 0.001, <0.001). We demonstrate remarkably inadequate and discontinuous HBV care for chronically infected mothers following pregnancy. As HBV infection is already being identified prenatally, quality improvement measures encompassing obstetricians, primary care providers and hepatologists are needed to ensure that HBV-infected women are linked to care postpregnancy."
7973,0.005,5.0,"Drug resistance is an increasing problem in the treatment of HIV infection. Tenofovir has been shown to inhibit HIV replication even with thymidine-associated resistance mutations (TAMs) if they are limited to two or less. Double-dose of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (600 mg QD) was used to determine weather the drug could be virologically effective in patients harbouring HIV-strains resistant to nucleoside analogues (NRTI). A pilot, open, non-comparative add-on study, where patients failing a current antiretroviral regimen, with at least two TAMs, and naive for tenofovir, were given tenofovir 600 mg once-daily for 4 weeks, in addition to their current failing antiretroviral regimen. The primary end-point was the percentage of patients with plasma viral load (VL) reduction of at least 0.8 log(10) between baseline and week 4 (W4). Ten patients were enrolled. At baseline, the median viral load was 3.66 log(10) copies/ml (range 3.13-4.03) and the median CD4 cell count was 407/mm(3) (range 136-1102). The percentage of patients with reduction the viral load > or =0.8 log(10) was 40% at W4. After 4 weeks of treatment with tenofovir 600 mg, the median decrease in the viral load was -0.61 log(10) (range -0.05; -0.88) and the median gain of CD4 was +109/mm(3). Despite a twofold increase tenofovir plasma concentrations, no serious drug-related adverse event were recorded except for one patient experiencing an de Fanconi syndrome at week 2. This add-on pilot study supports the concept of double dose tenofovir to virologically overcome the decreased sensitivity of NRTI-resistant viruses. However, the safety of this regimen needs to be considered carefully."

The association of insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis was also investigated."
5323,0.005,5.0,"In epidemiologic studies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at higher risk of incident diabetes mellitus compared with women with similar treatment histories. We used metabolomics to determine whether a sex difference in plasma amino acids, acylcarnitines, and organic acids predictive of diabetes and impaired energy metabolism is present in HIV-infected persons on long-term ART.We enrolled 70 HIV-infected adults (43% women) on efavirenz, tenofovir, and emtricitabine (Atripla) with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for over 2 years. Half of the HIV-infected subjects were obese, and these were matched with 30 obese HIV-negative controls. All subjects had no history of diabetes, statin use, or heavy alcohol use. Fasting insulin sensitivity was measured using homeostatic model assessment 2 (HOMA2), and adipose tissue was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to quantitate fasting plasma branched chain and aromatic amino acids predictive of incident diabetes, and C3 and C5 acylcarnitinines and organic acids indicative of impaired energy metabolism.HIV-infected women had more baseline risk factors for insulin resistance: women were older (46 vs 44 years) and had a longer ART duration (8.4 vs 5.1 years, P < 0.05 for both) compared with men but had similar CD4+ count (median 701 cells/μL), smoking and hepatic C prevalence, and body mass index (BMI) (median 30.3 kg/m). However, women had higher insulin sensitivity compared with men (P < 0.01), and lower plasma levels of isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine (P < 0.01 for all), and lower C3 and C5 acylcarnitines (P < 0.01 for all), in multivariable regression models after adjusting for DEXA fat mass index, age, race, CD4+ count, smoking, and ART duration. In the obese HIV-infected subjects and HIV-negative controls, the relationship of sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status.HIV-infected women on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART had superior glucose tolerance and lower plasma metabolites associated with the development of diabetes compared with men with similar metabolic disease risk profiles. The relationship between sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status among obese subjects, suggesting the observed sex-differences may not be specific to HIV infection.

1456,0.005,5.0,"In untreated, asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, elevated serum concentrations of soluble receptors for tumor necrosis factor (sTNFR) types I and II are associated with progression to AIDS. To assess the utility of sTNFRs as markers for the assessment of antiretroviral treatment, sTNFRs were sequentially determined in 47 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected men, who participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Progression to AIDS or severe AIDS-related complex occurred in six zidovudine (ZDV)- and six placebo-treated subjects. During ZDV treatment (n = 28) both types of sTNFRs declined compared with baseline and placebo, whereas they increased during placebo treatment (n = 19). A sustained decline of sTNFRs occurred only in subjects who experienced no disease progression. During the first 3 months of ZDV treatment, the hazard ratio for disease progression when sTNFR type II rose above the baseline value plus 5% was significantly increased (hazard ratio: approximately 25; 95% confidence interval: approximately 1.5-400; p < 0.03). Simultaneously determined CD4+ counts and serum neopterin levels showed a similar pattern in progressors and nonprogressors. Thus, in contrast to CD4+ counts and neopterin levels, sTNFR concentrations, especially those of the type II STNFR, appear to be valuable surrogate markers for monitoring the efficacy of ZDV treatment in asymptomatic HIV-1 infection."
2022,0.005,5.0,"Intracellular delivery of novel macromolecular drugs against human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), including antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, ribozymes and therapeutic genes, may be achieved by encapsulation in or association with certain types of liposomes. Liposomes may also protect these drugs against nucleases. Low-molecular-weight, charged antiviral drugs may also be delivered more efficiently via liposomes. Liposomes were targeted to HIV-1-infected cells via covalently coupled soluble CD4. An HIV-1 protease inhibitor encapsulated in conventional negatively charged multilamellar liposomes was about 10-fold more effective and had a lower EC90 than the free drug in inhibiting HIV-1 production in human monocyte-derived macrophages. The drug encapsulated in sterically stabilized liposomes was as effective as the free drug. The EC50 of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) was reduced by an order of magnitude when delivered to HIV-1-infected macrophages in pH-sensitive liposomes. A 15-mer antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against the Rev response element was ineffective in free form against HIV-1 replication in macrophages, while delivery of the oligonucleotide in pH-sensitive liposomes inhibited virus replication. The oligodeoxynucleotide encapsulated in sterically stabilized pH-sensitive liposomes with prolonged circulation in vivo, which were recently developed in the laboratories of the authors, was also highly effective. A ribozyme complementary to HIV-1 5'-LTR delivered in pH-sensitive liposomes inhibited virus production by 90%, while the free ribozyme caused only a slight inhibition. Cationic liposome-mediated co-transfection of the HIV-regulated diphtheria toxin A fragment gene and a proviral HIV clone into HeLa cells completely inhibited virus production, while the frame-shifted mutant gene was ineffective. Co-transfection of the proviral genome and a gene encoding a Rev-binding aptamer into HeLa cells via transferrin-associated cationic liposomes inhibited virus production. These studies indicate that liposomes can be used to facilitate the intracellular delivery of certain anti-HIV agents and to enhance their therapeutic effects. These properties may be particularly advantageous in the development of novel macromolecular drugs, which may be necessary because of the emergence of virus strains resistant to the currently available drugs."
3726,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV-DNA) was studied by Southern blot analysis in liver biopsy specimens from 75 HBsAg-positive patients with chronic liver disease living in southern Italy. Twenty-seven of the patients were hepatitis delta virus (HDV) superinfected. Intrahepatic HBV-DNA was detected in 54 (72%) patients, 32 (59%) of them with replicative forms. The presence of replicative forms was directly related to liver HBcAg and inversely related to liver HDAg, as shown by multivariate analysis. However, 14 patients with intrahepatic HBV-DNA non-replicative pattern and about half of HDV-infected patients were liver HBcAg and/or serum HBV-DNA positive, mostly in low amounts. Histological inflammatory activity was strongly related to liver HBcAg expression regardless of HDV superinfection, as confirmed by multivariate analysis. Our results confirm previous studies about the concordance between intrahepatic HBV-DNA replicative pattern and liver HBcAg expression and about inhibition by HDV of high-level HBV replication. However, they suggest that low-level HBV replication may have an important role in causing liver damage also among HDV-infected patients, in a population where the spreading of HBV and HDV is a naturally occurring event."
6100,0.005,5.0,"It has been hypothesized that naturally occurring mutations in HBV may play a role in the pathogenesis of HBV-related disease. We determined the molecular characteristics of naturally occurring HBV isolates and performed a functional analysis of full-length hepatitis B virus quasispecies from a patient with chronic hepatitis B. The 10 HBV clones isolated were identified as HBV genotype B4 and subtype adw. In most clones, amino acid substitutions and nucleotide changes occurred in a specific region of the core protein, X protein and in the core promoter. In the core protein, cI3L, cL60M, and cI97L were detected in 8 of 10 clones and cP130T was detected in all 10 clones. In the X protein, xI127M was detected in 5 clones. In the basal core promoter, the A1762T/G1764A mutation was found only in 1 clone. An 11-bp nucleotide insertion between nucleotides 1772 and 1773, was found in 2 clones. Six clones that were replication-competent exhibited variation in the level of replicating capacity in vitro even though the average genetic distance between the HBV clones was only 0.5% (range: 0.3-0.7%). Among the replication-competent 6 clones, 5 clones showed higher replication competency compared with clone B9 (reference clone used in this study) in Huh7 cells. However, 4 clones showed lower replication competency compared with clone B9 in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the HBV virus exhibits genetic variation in the form of quasispecies with different mutation patterns, and these quasispecies may be recognized by distinct viral replication patterns even in patients with subtle genetic mutation."

The objective is to describe the standard of care received by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH/A) at enrollment into one of five Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Sites located along the U.S.-Mexico border. This cross-sectional study describes the presence of opportunistic infections (OIs), AIDS status and two types of standard of care received by 707 PLWH/A participating in SPNS. Patients receiving care through SPNS in one of the five sites between June 1, 2002 and December 31, 2003 were invited to participate to the medical chart review component of the study. The association between sociodemographic variables and the prevalence of OIs and AIDS at enrollment was estimated using multivariate hierarchical logistic models. More than one quarter of the 707 participants had at least one OI recorded and 58% of new and 60% of existing patients had AIDS at enrollment in SPNS. The association between being Hispanic and having higher prevalence of OI and AIDS at entry varied by SPNS site. Standard of care was well followed overall. This is the first study describing HIV stage and OI prevalences and standard of care in PLWH/A in all U.S.-Mexico bordering states. Being of Hispanic ethnicity may not fully explain discrepancy in access to care along the border."

We identified 15 case patients during a 4-month period. Among inmates with a CD4 count of <100 cells/mm(3), case patients were more likely than control subjects to spend >/=20 hours per week in a communal day room (odds ratio, 42; P=.002) and were less likely to have a television in their single-person room (odds ratio, 0.10; P=.003). The communal day room was a likely site of transmission. Successful collaboration between the correctional system and public health departments halted the outbreak."

The Antiretroviral Treatment and Access Studies included a mail survey of 176 HIV medical care facilities in four US inner cities on clinic characteristics, services and practices, and patient characteristics. Characteristics of 143 (85%) responding Ryan White (RW) funded and non-RW funded facilities are described. RW funded facilities reported offering more services than non-funded facilities including evening/weekend hours (49% vs. 18%), transportation (71% vs. 22%), and on-site risk reduction counselling (88% vs. 55%). More RW funded facilities reported offering on-site adherence support services, such as support groups (44% vs. 12%), formal classes (20% vs. 2%), and pillboxes (83% vs. 43%), and served a larger proportion of uninsured patients (41% vs. 4%) than non-funded facilities. Our analysis showed that the RW funded HIV care facilities offered more clinic, non-clinic, and adherence support services than non-RW funded facilities, indicating that the disparities in services were still related to CARE Act funding, controlling for private-public facility type."

To determine whether individuals to whom variants with isolated NNRTI-associated drug resistance were transmitted are at increased risk of virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen, we identified minority variant resistance mutations in 33 individuals with isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance and 49 matched controls. We found similar proportions of overall and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated minority variant resistance mutations in both groups, suggesting that isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance may not be a risk factor for virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen."

All patients naïve to antiretrovirals who had > or =1 genotypic resistance testing at the Institute of Infectious Diseases (Brescia, Northern Italy) between 2001 and 2006 were analyzed. Primary resistance mutations were defined using epidemiological and clinical criteria. Mutations were interpreted using the Stanford University Algorithm. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess possible predictors of primary resistance mutations. Among 569 patients, 11% presented > or =1 mutation. Prevalence of primary resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), and protease inhibitors (PI) was 6.3%, 6%, and 1.6%, respectively. The most frequent mutations to NRTI were substitutions at position 215 (215Y in 3 patients, and 215 revertants in 16), 41L (13), 219Q (12), and 210W (10). Among mutations to NNRTI, 103N was found in 21 patients, while 181C, 188L, and 190A/S in 8, 3, and 4 patients, respectively. Fifty-one patients (9%) had high-to-intermediate resistance to > or =1 antiretroviral drug before starting the treatment. Regarding the new generation drugs, nine patients had intermediate resistance to etravirine, five patients had intermediate resistance to tipranavir, while five, one, and seven patients had low resistance to etravirine, tipranavir, and darunavir. Homosexuals were more likely to harbor a virus with primary resistance mutations (OR:2.68; 95% CI:1.44-5.00; P = 0.002) while non-Italian nationality was protective (OR:0.38; 95% CI:0.17-0.86; P = 0.020). Prevalence of primary resistance mutations suggests that genotypic resistance testing should be performed before starting treatment in naïve patients in Italy, particularly when NNRTI are prescribed."
7159,0.005,5.0,The effect of universal hepatitis B vaccination on the prevalence of serologically negative hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) and the emergence of HBsAg variants is unknown. We prospectively studied two different cohorts of 12--24 month old children in South Africa. They consisted of the unvaccinated children (n=459) born before the introduction of universal vaccination and the vaccinated children (n=1213) between 1 and 2 years after the introduction of the vaccination program. The frequency of detecting HBV DNA by PCR was reduced from 6.5% in unvaccinated children to 0.3% in vaccinated children (P<0.00001). There were no unique amino acid substitutions within the major hydrophilic region of the S sequence in both pre- and post-vaccination samples. Universal childhood vaccination reduced the frequency of serologically negative HBV infection and did not necessarily lead to selection of escape variants.

The specific aims of the current analysis were to determine (1) the prevalence of HCV infection in a large cohort of patients undergoing retransplantation, (2) define the impact of HCV infection on patient survival, and (3) determine the predictors of outcome of HCV-positive patients undergoing retransplantation for graft failure not caused by primary nonfunction."

Symptomatic raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure can be treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion (VPS). In HIV-infected patients however, there is a concern that VPS might be associated with unacceptably high rates of mortality. We aim to systematically review and appraise published literature to determine reported outcomes and identify predictors of outcome following VPS in relevant subgroups of HIV-infected adults."
8334,0.005,5.0,"Medication adherence is a complex behaviour with multiple determinants. Understanding the barriers and facilitators of adherence is invaluable for programme improvement, which assists the foundation of adherence intervention strategies. A qualitative study was conducted in six selected hospitals of Addis Ababa in 2008, to explore barriers and facilitators to antiretroviral medication adherence among HIV-infected paediatric patients. Twelve caregivers of adherent and non-adherent children and 14 key informants in five hospitals were included in the study. The findings revealed that over-dosage (heavy pill burden), fear of stigma and discrimination, cost and access to transportation, lack of understanding of the benefit of taking the medication, economic problems in the household, and lack of nutritional support were the barriers to adherence to HAART. The presence of mobile/wall alarm, the presence of follow-up counselling, improved health of the child, ART clinic setups, and disclosure of HIV serostatus were among the facilitators. This study indicated that paediatric adherence to antiretroviral therapy faces a huge challenge. It suggests the provision of income-generating schemes to caregivers for assisting HIV-infected children. Health care providers should address proper usage of medication reminders."
7435,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) share overlapping, large worldwide distribution. The implications of coinfection are being explored because of the importance of these viruses and demographic factors that favor coinfection. The nervous system is affected by HIV in a variety of ways resulting in significant disease of all levels of the nervous system. Emerging evidence that HCV can also impact the nervous system raises concerns that detrimental interactions might occur. Several reports addressing the manifestations of coinfection support independent contributions for both HIV and HCV on central nervous system performance, but not on distal sensory neuropathy. Neuropsychological testing reveals independent contributions resulting in poorer performance in coinfection in several drug-abusing cohorts. Motor physiologic testing substantiates performance deficits from HCV in coinfected subjects as does testing in treatment naive coinfected subjects. Although ongoing deficits attributed to HCV may be seen during HIV treatment, these deficits may be less apparent in advanced HIV disease. Current evidence supports independent contributions of HCV and HIV to neurological impairment. Preliminary evidence suggests that coinfection-related impairment does not appear to accelerate HIV-1-associated cognitive disease."
9870,0.005,5.0,"Human antibody response to Cryptosporidium parvum has been previously shown as involving immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG isotypes. The interest in anti-cryptosporidial IgA antibody response has been recently stimulated by studies on the therapeutic effects of secretory IgA antibodies to Cryptosporidium in animal models and in patients. In the present study, isotypes of serum anti-Cryptosporidium antibodies have been characterized in donors of the following categories: (a) healthy adults, (b) healthy children, (c) immunocompetent children with transient cryptosporidial diarrhea, (d) HIV-infected patients without clinical and parasitological evidence of Cryptosporidium infection and (e) AIDS patients with cryptosporidial diarrhea. Antibodies were detected using C. parvum oocysts purified by density gradient centrifugation from bovine faeces. The IgA antibodies were revealed using alpha-chain specific antibodies. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis with oocysts was used as control. Although high levels of serum antibodies of the IgA class were detected in some donors in the group of healthy adults, elevated values were consistently found in HIV-infected patients. Higher values were found in HIV patients with clinical cryptosporidiosis. The presence of a secretory component in serum IgA antibodies in these patients has been documented. Data indicate that IgA serum antibodies are produced as well as IgM and IgG antibodies upon contact with the parasite, and suggest that elevated IgA serum antibodies to Cryptosporidium are not associated with protection in HIV patients."
9473,0.005,5.0,"In order to verify the occurrence of intestinal parasitic infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, 100 HIV/AIDS patients (Group 1) and 85 clinically healthy individuals (Group 2) were submitted to coproparasitological examination. Intestinal parasites were detected in 27% of patients from Group 1 and in 17.6% from Group 2. In Group 1 the most frequent parasites were Strongyloides stercoralis (12%), with 2 cases of hyperinfection; Isospora belli, 7%; Cryptosporidium sp., 4%; with 1 asymptomatic case and hookworm, 4%. Of the infected patients from Group 1 who reported to be chronic alcoholics, 64.3% had strongyloidiasis. Only 6 of the 27 infected patients from Group 1 were on highly antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In Group 2 the most frequent parasites were S. stercoralis, 7.1%; hookworm, 7.1% and Giardia lamblia, 3.5%. In conclusion, diagnosing intestinal parasites in HIV/AIDS patients is necessary especially in those who report to be chronic alcoholics or are not on antiretroviral treatment."
6407,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects have increased levels of oxidative stress which could impair immunological function and therefore contribute to the progression of AIDS. These characteristics are usually evaluated at rest and responses to exercise have yet to be evaluated. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of a bout of aerobic exercise followed by resistance exercises on antioxidant system in HIV-infected and non-HIV subjects. There were included 14 cases (HIV-positive) and 14 controls (HIV-negative). The exercise protocol consisted of a single session of 20 minutes on a cycloergometer followed by a set of six resistance exercises. The activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase were measured in plasma samples, total glutathione (TGSH) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured in erythrocytes. T CD4+ cells, T CD8+, viral load, complete blood count, and white blood count were also assessed. All measurements were performed at three times: baseline, after aerobic exercise, and after resistance exercises. At baseline, the HIV group had lower GST activity than controls, but after the exercise session GST values were similar in both groups. Compared to the control group TGSH was significantly lower in the HIV group at baseline, after aerobic and resistance exercises. The control group presented higher TBARS values after aerobic exercise compared to the HIV group. The neutrophil count was lower in the HIV group after aerobic and resistance exercises. These data indicate that HIV-infected subjects had lower antioxidant activity at rest. Physical exercise stimulated the enzymatic activity similarly in both groups."
5107,0.005,5.0,"Cryptosporidium spp. are a major cause of diarrheal disease in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient individuals. They also cause waterborne disease in both the United States and United Kingdom. Studies on the mechanisms of immunity to cryptosporidiosis indicate the importance of the T-cell response. The spectrum and severity of disease in immunocompromised individuals with cryptosporidiosis reflect this importance since the most severe disease is seen in individuals with defects in the T-cell response. The most commonly studied group is that of patients with AIDS. These patients suffer from more severe and prolonged gastrointestinal disease that can be fatal; in addition, body systems other than the gastrointestinal tract may be affected. The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy does appear to be having a beneficial effect on recovery from cryptosporidiosis and on the frequency of infection in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients. Other diseases that are associated with increased risk of severe cryptosporidiosis, such as primary immunodeficiencies, most notably severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, are also predominantly associated with T-cell defects. Of the remaining groups, children with acute leukemia seem to be most at risk from cryptosporidiosis. There is less evidence of severe complications in patients with other malignant diseases or in those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy."
8784,0.005,5.0,"Pigtailed macaques infected with a virulent human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) strain develop renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which morphologically resembles aspects of human HIV-associated TMA. Apoptotic cell death of microvascular endothelial cells might be a pathogenetic clue to this disease. For defining further the pattern of cellular injury in this model, serial kidney sections of 58 macaques infected with HIV-2 and 7 uninfected controls were studied by routine microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, and immunohistochemistry for single-stranded DNA, p53, the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1 peptide product, caspase-3, and the proliferation marker Ki67. Selected cases were further evaluated by in situ end labeling and transmission electron microscopy. Kidneys of 13 HIV-2-infected animals contained a pattern of cellular injury, which was characterized by (1) nuclear swelling with an ultrastructural morphology different from apoptotic nuclei, (2) sharply demarcated areas of renal cells with chromatin nicks (TUNEL positive) and single-stranded DNA, (3) absence of an inflammatory or proliferative response, (4) upregulation of p53 and loss of at least one cellular differentiation marker (Wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1), (5) a tight correlation with the diagnosis of renal TMA, and (6) a contrast between profound changes in the renal cellular morphology and the apparently unaffected clinical condition of the host. This pattern of injury, which shares some features of both apoptotic and oncotic necrosis, might be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated renal TMA in this model."
8624,0.005,5.0,"The aim of our study was to determine a minimum threshold CD4 count for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation in HIV-infected patients. A schema using longitudinal data from a clinical cohort was designed. The presenting CD4 counts of asymptomatic HIV-infected patients in Hong Kong were evaluated in relation to their progression to AIDS within 1 year of diagnosis of HIV infection. A graph was generated to depict the changes in the percentage of cumulative AIDS diagnoses for every 10 cell/microL increase in presenting CD4 count. Of 181 patients, 24 had developed AIDS within 1 year of diagnosis of HIV infection. Setting the CD4 count threshold at 150 cells/microL gave a good balance between the number of preventable AIDS-defining events and the number of non-AIDS patients initiating HAART. No extra AIDS-defining events occurred when the CD4 count threshold was reduced from 200 to 150 cells/microL, despite the addition of 13 more patients. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, presenting CD4 count was a significant predictor for AIDS occurrence. The relative hazard for AIDS occurrence of patients with presenting CD4 counts <or=150 cells/microL was 27-fold greater. We suggest a CD4 count of 150 cells/microL as the minimum threshold for HAART initiation in a cohort of Chinese HIV-infected patients. At this level, 20.8% of the AIDS-defining events could be prevented. While a cut-off of 200 cells/microL remains a standard for considering HAART initiation, the minimum threshold signifies a critical moment for timely intervention to be introduced."
2221,0.005,5.0,"Sequences from the nef/LTR overlap region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) genome were amplified from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 40 HIV-2-infected individuals in The Gambia, West Africa. Additional sequences from the plasma of three blood donors were also derived. Analysis of HIV-2 U3 LTR transcription factor elements (PuB-1, p-ets, PuB-2, peri-kappa B, and NF-kappa B sites) indicated a relatively high level of conservation in vivo. The region immediately 3' of the nef termination codon, which exhibits clade-dependent specificity, was targeted by PCR to differentiate HIV-2 subtype A from subtype B infections, the two principal clinical HIV-2 subtypes. All clinical samples analyzed (n = 43) from The Gambia were identified as HIV-2 subtype A by a combination of LTR sequence analysis and subtype-specific amplification of subtypes A and B. Differential PCR amplification of the HIV-2 U3 LTR region represents a rapid means of differentiating subtype A from subtype B infections, the two dominant HIV-2 subtypes that are important in human disease."
1278,0.005,5.0,"HLA and other genetic variants, playing an important role in innate and adaptive immunity, are known to influence tuberculosis (TB) development in HIV-1-positive (HIV+) patients. Because inflammasome genes contribute to HIV-1 susceptibility, we investigated the possible association between polymorphisms in inflammasome genes with HIV-1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis coinfection (HIV+TB+) in a case/control cohort of Brazilian individuals. Nineteen single-nucleotide polymoprhims in 8 inflammasome genes (NLRP1, NLRP3, AIM2, CARD8, CASP1, IL1B, IL1R, and HSP90) were analyzed in HIV+TB+ Brazilian patients (from Recife, Pernambuco). CARD8 rs6509365 polymorphism was associated with HIV+TB+ (P = 5 × 10(-5)), suggesting a predisposing role of this variant in M. tuberculosis susceptibility in HIV+ subjects (odds ratio = 2.45). This effect is even strong when this allele is combined to CARD8 rs2043211 single-nucleotide polymoprhim. The results of this study support the novel association between CARD8 gene and HIV+TB+ coinfection, demonstrating that inflammasome genetics could influence HIV-1 infection and the development of opportunistic infection."
4699,0.005,5.0,"During the earlier years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, initial reports described sensorineural hearing loss in up to 49% of individuals with HIV/AIDS. During those years, patients commonly progressed to advanced stages of HIV disease and frequently had neurological complications. However, the abnormalities on pure-tone audiometry and brainstem-evoked responses outlined in small studies were not always consistently correlated with advanced stages of HIV/AIDS. Moreover, these studies could not exclude the confounding effect of concurrent opportunistic infections and syphilis. Additional reports also have indicated that some antiretroviral medications may be ototoxic; thus, it has been difficult to make conclusions regarding the cause of changes in hearing function in HIV-infected patients. More recently, accelerated aging has been suggested as a potential explanation for the disproportionate increase in complications of aging described in many HIV-infected patients; hence, accelerated aging-associated hearing loss may also be playing a role in these patients."
4573,0.005,5.0,"Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) used for the treatment of HIV-1 inhibit the replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which may contribute to severe mitochondrial toxicity including lipodystrophy, through the inhibition of polymerase gamma (POLG). Polymorphisms of POLG could explain the variation in mitochondrial toxicity in HIV-1-infected patients. We explored the relationship between selected polymorphisms of POLG and lipodystrophy related to NRTIs. We studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at three amino acid residues (R1142, E1143 and R1146) and the CAG repeats of POLG in a case-control study including HIV-1 treated patients with lipodystrophy (n=69) and 2 controls (without lipodystrophy) per case matched by age, race and sex (n=138). Compared with matched controls, the polymorphisms in E1143 were significantly more frequent in case patients with lipodystrophy (aOR=4.7; p=0.048), and this was associated with a significant decrease of mtDNA in PBMC. In addition, among the parameters tested, the conditional logistic regression showed that the lipodystrophy has a strong link with E1143 polymorphisms, associated with D4T treatment (aOR=9.29, p=0.002). In conclusion, patients harbouring the changes of E1143 in the catalytic site of POLG exhibit a 4-fold increased risk to develop lipodystrophy than HIV-1 treated patients who do not have changes in E1143 and this risk can increase if the patient presenting the SNP received D4T. These could be due to decreased content of mtDNA in PBMC in these patients. Therefore, the toxicity of NRTIs leading to lipodystrophy in some HIV-1 infected patients could be explained in part by the occurrence of POLG polymorphisms."
6917,0.005,5.0,"In a recent randomized controlled trial, the use of protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) was associated with a significantly lower incidence of malaria compared with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus-infected Ugandan children living in an area of high malaria transmission intensity. In this report, we compared the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia and gametocytemia using data from the same cohort. The prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia did not differ between the two ART treatment arms. The PI-based arm was associated with a lower risk of gametocytemia at the time of diagnosis of malaria (6.6% versus 14.5%, P = 0.03) and during the 28 days after malaria diagnosis (3.4% versus 6.5%, P = 0.04). Thus, in addition to decreasing the incidence of malaria, the use of PI-based ART may lower transmission, as a result of a decrease in gametocytemia, in areas of high malaria transmission intensity."
10012,0.005,5.0,"The aim of this study was to analyse the lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected adults to compare them with four patients with acute EBV infection. Lymphocyte subsets in 15 healthy controls, 40 HIV-1-infected adults and 4 EBV-infected patients with infectious mononucleosis were analysed by flow cytometry. The immunophenotyping of HIV-1-infected patients in different stages of disease showed a significant reduction in the percentage and absolute count of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, significantly increased percentage of CD8+ T-lymphocytes, inverted CD4/CD8 ratio and an increase in the expression of activation marker HLA-DR compared to controls. The immuno-phenotyping profiles of HIV and EBV infection share some similarities as they both result in the decreased percentage of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, increased CD8+ T-lymphocytes and an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio. Patients with HIV infection could be distinguished from patients with EBV infection by the absolute lymphocytosis and increased expression of HLA-DR seen in the patients with infectious mononucleosis. In conclusion, both HIV-1 and EBV profoundly change the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood. It is our opinion that flow cytometry could be an aid in the rapid distinguishing of patients with suspected primary HIV-1 infection from those with infectious mononucleosis (before serology data are available)."
9302,0.005,5.0,"Both HCV and HIV are common in haemophiliacs previously treated with non-viral-inactivated clotting factor concentrates. Because of increased bleeding risks, little data are available on the safety of percutaneous outpatient liver biopsy (LBx) and impact of HIV coinfection in this population. This study aims at reporting our experience with percutaneous LBx in a cohort of haemophiliacs infected with HCV and describe the spectrum of disease and impact of HIV coinfection. A retrospective review of consecutive patients with haemophilia and HCV who underwent percutaneous LBx was performed. All patients were positive for HCV RNA by commercial assay and received factor concentrate prior to biopsy. A total of 29 male patients (mean age 36, 24 haemophilia A, five haemophilia B, and 44% coinfected with HIV) underwent successful outpatient percutaneous LBx without bleeding complication. Histologic activity index was 6.44 with advanced fibrosis (bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis) in 31%. When patients were stratified by HIV positive (n = 13) vs. HIV negative (n = 16), coinfected patients had higher fibrosis scores and higher proportion advanced fibrosis (54% vs. 12%; P = 0.0167) with no differences in age, demographic or other laboratory parameters. Multivariate logistic regression found that HIV positivity was independently associated with advanced fibrosis (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.17-11.8; P = 0.026). Outpatient percutaneous LBx can be safely performed in patients with haemophilia. Despite similar age, HIV coinfection was an independent predictor of advanced fibrosis. These data support the hypothesis that HIV accelerates fibrosis progression in those coinfected with HCV and highlights the importance of liver histology in this population."
4589,0.005,5.0,"After the identification of HIV-2 in 1986, most of the cases reported have been concentrated in West Africa. We identified a case of HIV-2 infection in São Paulo, Brazil of a 45-year-old female who presented with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, with a CD4 count of 22 cells/ml. DNA samples from this patient were subjected to end-point PCR amplification of the LTR region. Clones were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. All clones were subtype A related, and four presented an insertion, corresponding to an extra NF-kappaB site. This is the first confirmed case report of an HIV-2-infected subject identified in Brazil whose transmission occurred within the country. Furthermore, the NF-kappaB duplication would potentially be associated with an increase in viral cytopathogenicity. This raises concern for the need for permanent monitoring of the spread of HIV-2 in different areas of the world, even considering its lower rate of transmission and pathogenicity when compared to HIV-1."
7009,0.005,5.0,"IgM, IgG, and HBsAg containing circulating immune complexes (CIC) were determined, by conglutinin (K) and C1q assays, for assessing the role of CIC in hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in 54 HBsAg-negative controls and 85 HBsAg-positive patients with chronic hepatitis. The prevalence of HDV markers (HDV antigen and anti-HD) was 24.70% (21/85). CIC were a common feature of HDV infection with 95.24% of patients having at least one abnormal test result. The prevalence of elevated IgM-K, IgG-K, IgM-C1q, and IgG-C1q CIC were 85.71, 85.71, 57.14, and 85.71%, respectively. The prevalence of IgM class CIC were statistically higher in patients with HDV infection than in those without (P = .001 for the K assay and P = .023 for the C1q assay). There was no difference in the prevalence of IgG class CIC. Patients with HDV infection also have significantly higher median levels of IgM K-CIC (P = .002), IgG K-CIC (P = .049), and IgG C1q-CIC (P = .008). In patients with HDV infection, there was positive correlation between IgM C1q-CIC and transaminase levels (r = .519, P = .016 for AST; r = .500, P = .021 for ALT). There was no difference in the prevalence of HBsAg containing CIC between patients with HDV infection (76.19%) and those without (74.60%). In conclusion, IgM class CIC are the major CIC and correlate with disease activity in HDV infection. CIC may play a role in the pathogenesis of HDV infection."
8443,0.005,5.0,A complementarity-determining region (CDR) of the mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) F58 was constructed with specificity to a neutralization-inducing region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The mAb has its major reactivity to the amino acid sequence I--GPGRA in the V3 viral envelope region. All CDRs including several framework amino acids were synthesized from the sequence deduced by cloning and sequencing mAb F58 heavy- and light-chain variable domains. Peptides derived from the third heavy-chain domain (CDR-H3) alone or in combination with the other CDR sequences competed with F58 mAb for the V3 region. The CDR-H3 peptide was chemically modified by cyclization and then inhibited HIV-1 replication as well as syncytium formation by infected cells. Both the homologous IIIB viral strain to which the F58 mAb was induced and the heterologous SF2 strain were inhibited. This synthetic peptide had unexpectedly potent antiviral activity and may be a potential tool for treatment of HIV-infected persons.
5786,0.005,5.0,"Patients with treated HIV-1-infection experience earlier occurrence of aging-associated diseases, raising speculation that HIV-1-infection, or antiretroviral treatment, may accelerate aging. We recently described an age-related co-methylation module comprised of hundreds of CpGs; however, it is unknown whether aging and HIV-1-infection exert negative health effects through similar, or disparate, mechanisms. We investigated whether HIV-1-infection would induce age-associated methylation changes. We evaluated DNA methylation levels at >450,000 CpG sites in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of young (20-35) and older (36-56) adults in two separate groups of participants. Each age group for each data set consisted of 12 HIV-1-infected and 12 age-matched HIV-1-uninfected samples for a total of 96 samples. The effects of age and HIV-1 infection on methylation at each CpG revealed a strong correlation of 0.49, p<1 x 10(-200) and 0.47, p<1 x 10(-200). Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified 17 co-methylation modules; module 3 (ME3) was significantly correlated with age (cor=0.70) and HIV-1 status (cor=0.31). Older HIV-1+ individuals had a greater number of hypermethylated CpGs across ME3 (p=0.015). In a multivariate model, ME3 was significantly associated with age and HIV status (Data set 1: βage=0.007088, p=2.08 x 10(-9); βHIV=0.099574, p=0.0011; Data set 2: βage=0.008762, p=1.27 x 10(-5); βHIV=0.128649, p=0.0001). Using this model, we estimate that HIV-1 infection accelerates age-related methylation by approximately 13.7 years in data set 1 and 14.7 years in data set 2. The genes related to CpGs in ME3 are enriched for polycomb group target genes known to be involved in cell renewal and aging. The overlap between ME3 and an aging methylation module found in solid tissues is also highly significant (Fisher-exact p=5.6 x 10(-6), odds ratio=1.91). These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection is associated with methylation patterns that are similar to age-associated patterns and suggest that general aging and HIV-1 related aging work through some common cellular and molecular mechanisms. These results are an important first step for finding potential therapeutic targets and novel clinical approaches to mitigate the detrimental effects of both HIV-1-infection and aging."
7777,0.005,5.0,"CCR5 is an important chemokine receptor involved in the recruitment of specific anti-viral immune cells (e.g., NK cells and T cytotoxic cells) to the liver. Previous studies indicated that the Δ 32 mutation in CCR5 gene led to inactivation of CCR5. Several conflicting studies have suggested that this mutation may be associated with either recovery or persistence of HBV infection. The main purpose of this study was to compare the frequency of the Δ 32 mutation within the CCR5 gene in a group of patients infected chronically with HBV with healthy individuals from South-East of Iran. Sixty patients with chronic HBV infection as well as 300 age-, and sex-match healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Gap-PCR was applied to determine the frequency of CCR5 Δ 32 mutation in both groups. The results demonstrated that none of the patients infected with HBV carried the CCR5 Δ 32 mutation while, 3 (1%) of the healthy individuals were found to be heterozygotic for this mutation. The CCR5 Δ 32 mutation is not a prevalent mutation in either the patients infected chronically with HBV or their health counterparts in the South-East region of Iran. This may be attributed to either different genetic settings of the investigated population or lack of any significant correlation between this mutation and HBV pathogenicity."
321,0.005,5.0,"Nosocomial multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people is recognized in Europe and America. We report the first such outbreak in South Africa. Six hospitalized women, identified by DNA fingerprinting, were infected with an outbreak strain of MDR-TB while receiving treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis. The putative source case was identified as an HIV-positive woman who underwent prolonged hospitalization for chronic cavitary tuberculosis. Compared with other HIV-positive patients in the hospital, outbreak patients were more immunocompromised, had fewer cavitary lung changes, and were less likely to have been treated before. They had high fevers, infiltrative patterns on chest radiographs, and a mean survival of 43 days. When individual isolation is not possible, separating highly immunocompromised patients with first-time tuberculosis from previously treated patients with cavitary lesions and from those with established drug resistance may reduce nosocomial transmission."

9709,0.005,5.0,"The HIV and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemics are closely linked. In Thailand as part of a sentinel surveillance system, we collected data prospectively about pulmonary TB cases treated in public clinics. A subset of HIV-infected TB patients identified through this system had additional data collected for a research study. We conducted multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with MDR-TB. Of 10,428 TB patients, 2,376 (23%) were HIV-infected; 145 (1%) had MDR-TB. Of the MDR-TB cases, 52 (37%) were HIV-infected. Independent risk factors for MDR-TB included age 18-29 years old, male sex, and previous TB treatment, but not HIV infection. Among new patients, having an injection drug use history was a risk factor for MDR-TB. Of 539 HIV-infected TB patients in the research study, MDR-TB was diagnosed in 19 (4%); the only significant risk factors were previous TB treatment and previous hepatitis. In Thailand, HIV is common among MDR-TB patients, but is not an independent risk factor for MDR-TB. Populations at high risk for HIV-young adults, men, injection drug users - should be prioritized for drug susceptibility testing."

We investigated sub-optimal adherence according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill assessment methods, and their associated factors among HIV-infected adults receiving cART in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Eight-hundred seventy patients who initiated cART between May 2009 and April 2012 were randomly selected, and 664 patients who were alive, had remained in clinical care and were receiving cART for at least six-months were included. Sub-optimal adherence was defined as patients' response of less than ""all-of the time"" to the self-report adherence question, or any clinician-recorded poor adherence during the six most recent clinic visits, or a pharmacy-refill of <95% medication possession ratio (MPR). Logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with sub-optimal adherence. The average adherence level to cART, expressed as MPR, was nearly 97%. However, sub-optimal adherence occurred in 12%, 4%, and 27% of patients according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill measures, respectively. More satisfaction with social support was significantly associated with less sub-optimal adherence according to self-report and clinician-record. Younger age, lower educational level, and lower CD4 cell count at cART initiation were significantly associated with sub-optimal refill-based adherence. Findings from our large multi-center study suggest that sub-optimal adherence was present in up to a quarter of the patients, despite a high degree of average adherence to cART. Interventions aimed at preventing sub-optimal adherence should focus on improving social support, on younger patients, on patients with lower educational level, and on those who started cART at a lower CD4 cell count."
1255,0.005,5.0,"Fluconazole inhibits cytochrome P-450-mediated enzymatic metabolism of several drugs. Since hepatic metabolism is partially responsible for 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (didanosine or ddI) elimination, fluconazole therapy may lead to increased ddI concentrations in serum and subsequent concentration-dependent adverse effects. The purpose of this study was to determine if ddI pharmacokinetics are influenced by a 7-day course of oral fluconazole. Twelve adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had received a constant dosage of ddI for at least 2 weeks were investigated. On study day 1, multiple serum samples for determination of ddI concentrations were obtained over 12 h. Then subjects received a 7-day course of oral fluconazole (200 mg every 12 h for two doses and then 200 mg once daily for 6 days) while ddI therapy continued. Following the last dose of fluconazole, serum samples for determination of ddI concentrations were again obtained over 12 h. ddI concentrations in serum were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. In contrast to previously published data, there was marked between-subject variability in ddI areas under the concentration-time curve, even when the dose was normalized for weight. No significant differences were found between mean ddI areas under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h on study day 1 (1,528 +/- 902 ngx.hr/ml) and following fluconazole treatment (1,486 +/- 649 ngx.hr/ml) . There were no significant differences in other pharmacokinetic parameters, such as ddI peak concentrations in serum (971 +/- 509 and 942 +/- 442 ng/ml) or half-lives (80 +/- 32 and 85 +/- 21 min.) before and after fluconazole treatment, respectively. We conclude that a 7-day course of oral fluconazole does not significantly alter ddI pharmacokinetics in adults that are infected with human immunodeficiency virus."
3509,0.005,5.0,"There are approximately 240 million patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection worldwide. Up to 40% of HBV-infected patients can progress to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or chronic end-stage liver disease during their lifetime. This, in turn, is responsible for around 650000 deaths annually worldwide. Repeated hepatitis flares may increase the progression of liver fibrosis, making the accurate diagnosis of the stage of liver fibrosis critical in order to make antiviral therapeutic decisions for HBV-infected patients. Liver biopsy remains the ""gold standard"" for diagnosing liver fibrosis. However, this technique has recently been challenged by the development of several novel noninvasive tests to evaluate liver fibrosis, including serum markers, combined models and imaging techniques. In addition, the cost and accessibility of imaging techniques have been suggested as additional limitations for invasive assessment of liver fibrosis in developing countries. Therefore, a noninvasive assessment model has been suggested to evaluate liver fibrosis, specifically in HBV-infected patients, owing to its high applicability, inter-laboratory reproducibility, wide availability for repeated assays and reasonable cost. The current review aims to present the status of knowledge in this new and exciting field, and to highlight the key points in HBV-infected patients for clinicians. "
2964,0.005,5.0,"An important driving force behind the sequence diversity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is viral adaptation to host immune responses. To gain an insight into the impact of host immunity on genetic diversification and properties of HBV, we characterized HBV of genotype D from treatment-naive hepatitis B e antigen-positive (EP) and hepatitis B e antigen-negative (EN) patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), where HBV is under stronger immune pressure, with that of HBV derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV-coinfected individuals, where HIV infection has significantly weakened the immune system. Full-length sequence analysis showed that HBV heterogeneity was most extensive in EN-CHB followed by EP-CHB and HIV/HBV coinfection. The relative magnitude of non-synonymous changes within B-cell epitopes was greater than that in T-cell epitopes of HBV open reading frames (ORFs) in both EP-CHB and EN-CHB. Nine amino acid substitutions were identified in B-cell epitopes and one in a T-cell epitope of HBV in EN-CHB, most of which resulted in altered hydrophobicities, as determined using the Kyte and Doolittle method, relative to wild-type residues found in HBV from the HIV-positive group. Additionally, 19 substitutions occurred at significantly higher frequencies in non-epitope regions of HBV ORF-P in EN-CHB than HIV/HBV-coinfected patients. In vitro replication assay demonstrated that the substitutions, particularly in reverse transcriptase and RNaseH domains of ORF-P, resulted in a decline in replication capacity of HBV. Hence, our results indicate that HBV adapts to increasing immune pressure through preferential mutations in B-cell epitopes and by replicative attenuation. The viral epitopes linked to immune response identified in this study bear important implications for future HBV vaccine studies."
3566,0.005,5.0,"In 1994, the US Public Health Service published guidelines for the use of zidovudine to decrease the risk of perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1995, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the US Public Health Service recommended documented, routine HIV education and testing with consent for all pregnant women in the United States. Widespread incorporation of these guidelines into clinical practice has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the rate of perinatal HIV transmission and has contributed to more than a 75% decrease in reported cases of pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) since 1992. Substantial advances have been made in the treatment and monitoring of HIV infection; combination antiretroviral regimens that maximally suppress virus replication are now available. These regimens are recommended for pregnant and nonpregnant individuals who require treatment. Risk factors associated with perinatal HIV transmission are now better understood, and recent results from trials to decrease the rate of mother-to-child HIV transmission have contributed new strategies with established efficacy. However, perinatal HIV transmission still occurs; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 300 to 400 infected infants are born annually. Full implementation of recommendations for universal, routine prenatal HIV testing and evaluation of missed prevention opportunities will be critical to further decrease the incidence of pediatric HIV infection in the United States. This technical report summarizes recent advances in the prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV relevant to screening of pregnant women and their infants."
4323,0.005,5.0,"Fitness disadvantage of the transitional intermediates compared to the initial R5 viruses has been suggested to constitute one of the blockades to coreceptor switching, explaining the late appearance of X4 viruses. Using a simian model for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor switching, we demonstrate in this study that similar molecular evolutionary pathways to coreceptor switch occur in more than one R5 simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)(SF162P3N)-infected macaque. In infected animals where multiple pathways for expansion or switch to CXCR4 coexist, fitness of the transitional intermediates in coreceptor usage efficiency influences their outgrowth and representation in the infecting virus population. Dualtropic and X4 viruses appear at different disease stages, but they have lower entry efficiency than the coexisting R5 strains, which may explain why they do not outcompete the R5 viruses. Similar observations were made in two infected macaques with coreceptor switch, providing in vivo evidence that fitness disadvantage is an obstacle to X4 emergence and expansion."
615,0.005,5.0,"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a key molecule of the innate immune system and a competent to bind carbohydrates of a variety of microorganisms, resulting in complement activation and opsonophagocytosis against various pathogens. However, there is no systemic investigation on the MBL's role in innate immune responses against HIV-1 infection among northern Han Chinese. This study investigated the association between MBL and HIV-1 infection susceptibility among northern Han Chinese. A total of 91 HIV-1 infected patients and 91 HIV-1 seronegative healthy individuals were recruited. Six polymorphisms of MBL2 gene were genotyped by pyrosequencing. The quantitative measurement of serum MBL concentration and MBL complex activity were performed by ELISA. The CD4+ T-cell counts were determined by flow cytometry. The plasma viral loads of 91 HIV-1 infected patients were determined by bDNA method. The results show that there is an association between MBL and HIV-1 infection susceptibility among northern Han Chinese. The individuals with B variant, low serum MBL concentration and low MBL complex activity are more susceptible to HIV-1 infection."
6558,0.005,5.0,"The identification of various risk factors of vertical human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission resulted in the development of strategies whose aim was to decrease the mother's viral load, to reduce her child's exposure to it during delivery, and to avoid the subsequent viral exposure due to breastfeeding. The administration of antiretroviral treatment during pregnancy, delivery and to the neonate (PACTG 076) proved to be useful. At a first stage, zidovudine was used. A triple combination therapy was then administered. Initially, the viral transmission in mothers who were enrolled in protocols for vertically transmitted HIV prophylaxis was reduced to 9.5%, whereas the last measurement carried out between 1998 and 2005, the initial figure was brought down to 2%. Nevertheless, the delivery of infected children whose mother's HIV status was unknown is still considered likely to happen. The main step to be taken to reduce HIV infection among children is to perform universal HIV tests during pregnancy, so that HIV positive pregnant patients conveniently receive proper prophylaxis. We look forward to achieving this by following the new prevention guidelines of vertically-transmitted HIV infection, developed by the Comisión Nacional del SIDA of the Chilean Health Ministry."
2776,0.005,5.0,"We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of a PCR-based qualitative test for the rapid diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare complex (MAC) bacteremia in patients with AIDS disease. Eleven subjects with newly culture-proven MAC bacteremia had the following tests performed at biweekly intervals during the first 8 weeks of therapy: blood culture, Mycobacterium-specific PCR, and quantitative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral-load testing. Mycobacterium genus-specific biotinylated primers were used to amplify a sequence of approximately 582 nucleotides within the 16S rRNA genes of M. avium and M. intracellulare. Detection of the amplified product was performed with an oligonucleotide probe-coated microwell plate combined with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase-tetramethylbenzidine conjugate-substrate system. While not as sensitive as BACTEC culture, PCR detected 17 of 18 specimens which grew >/=40 organisms/ml (94.4% sensitivity) and 9 of 16 specimens which grew </=40 organisms/ml (56.3% sensitivity). No clear change in HIV viremia occurred in response to successful treatment of patients' MAC bacteremia. Use of the PCR test allowed detection of MAC bacteremia in 1 day, with a sensitivity similar to those of quantitative blood culture techniques, and it may prove useful for rapid screening of suspected cases. HIV viremia was unaffected by 8 weeks of MAC therapy."
7444,0.005,5.0,"The objective of this study was to assess the performance of 4 biologic tests designed to detect recent HIV-1 infections in estimating incidence in West Africa (BED, Vironostika, Avidity, and IDE-V3). These tests were assessed on a panel of 135 samples from 79 HIV-1-positive regular blood donors from Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, whose date of seroconversion was known (Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA et les Hépatites Virales 1220 cohort). The 135 samples included 26 from recently infected patients (< or =180 days), 94 from AIDS-free subjects with long-standing infection (>180 days), and 15 from patients with clinical AIDS. The performance of each assay in estimating HIV incidence was assessed through simulations. The modified commercial assays gave the best results for sensitivity (100% for both), and the IDE-V3 technique gave the best result for specificity (96.3%). In a context like Abidjan, with a 10% HIV-1 prevalence associated with a 1% annual incidence, the estimated test-specific annual incidence rates would be 1.2% (IDE-V3), 5.5% (Vironostika), 6.2% (BED), and 11.2% (Avidity). Most of the specimens falsely classified as incident cases were from patients infected for >180 days but <1 year. The authors conclude that none of the 4 methods could currently be used to estimate HIV-1 incidence routinely in Côte d'Ivoire but that further adaptations might enhance their accuracy."
446,0.005,5.0,"The paper describes some preliminary attempts to formulate simple mathematical models of the transmission dynamics of HIV infection in homosexual communities. In conjunction with a survey of the available epidemiological data on HIV infection and the incidence of AIDS, the models are used to assess how various processes influence the course of the initial epidemic following the introduction of the virus. Models of the early stages of viral spread provide crude methods for estimating the basic reproductive rate of the virus, given a knowledge of the incubation period of the disease (AIDS) and the initial doubling time of the epidemic. More complex models are formulated to assess the influence of variation in the incubation period and heterogeneity in sexual activity. The latter factor is shown to have a major effect on the predicted pattern of the epidemic; high levels of heterogeneity decrease its magnitude. Areas of biological uncertainty, future research needs, and public health implications are discussed."
2383,0.005,5.0,"We review studies examining the quality and quantity of social relationships as potential risk factors for differential progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Several well-conducted prospective studies suggest that the health effects associated with the presence of supportive social relationships vary according to disease stage and mode of transmission. For gay or bisexual males in the early stages of infection, the presence of supportive social relationships appears to be a risk factor for accelerated disease progression. For individuals in the later stages of infection and those who acquire HIV via intravenous drug use or transfusion, supportive social relationships appear to be associated with health protective effects similar to those observed in other disease settings. We consider a variety of potential explanations for accelerated disease progression in gay men with extensive networks of personal relationships."
9519,0.005,5.0,"Aging with HIV poses unique and complex challenges, including avoidance of neurocognitive disorder. Our objective here is to identify the prevalence and predictors of successful cognitive aging (SCA) in a sample of older adults with HIV. One hundred three HIV-infected individuals aged 50 and older were recruited from the Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic in Italy. Participants were treated with combination antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year and had suppressed plasma HIV viral load. SCA was defined as the absence of neurocognitive impairment (as defined by deficits in tasks of episodic learning, information processing speed, executive function, and motor skills) depression, and functional impairment (instrumental activities of daily living). In cross-sectional analyses, odds of SCA were assessed in relation to HIV-related clinical data, HIV-Associated Non-AIDS (HANA) conditions, multimorbidity (≥2HANA conditions), and frailty. A frailty index was calculated as the number of deficits present out of 37 health variables. SCA was identified in 38.8% of participants. Despite no differences in average chronologic age between groups, SCA participants had significantly fewer HANA conditions, a lower frailty index, and were less likely to have hypertension. In addition, hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, p = .04), multimorbidity (OR = 0.35, p = .05), and frailty (OR = 0.64, p = .04) were significantly associated with odds of SCA. Frailty is associated with the likelihood of SCA in people living with HIV. This defines an opportunity to apply knowledge from geriatric population research to people aging with HIV to better appreciate the complexity of their health status."

1383,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection during pregnancy is a condition that requires multidisciplinary care. Care must be rendered that is appropriate for both the mother and the fetus. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is of paramount concern. To prevent transmission, universal testing for HIV infection in pregnant women is ideal. In the United States and other developed countries, great strides have been made toward decreasing the risk of HIV transmission to infants to <2% with use of a combination of highly active antiretroviral therapy during the antepartum period and during labor and delivery, scheduled cesarean section when appropriate, avoidance of breast-feeding, and 6 weeks of zidovudine prophylaxis for infants. The continuation of antiretroviral therapy after delivery depends on the needs of the mother with regard to treatment of her own health. In resource-limited countries, where simplified and shortened courses of antiretroviral regimens have been used, reduction in mother-to-child transmission has also been shown, although not as effectively as that with highly active antiretroviral therapy. In these settings, exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months is recommended to reduce the risk of postnatal transmission."
6570,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation during immunosuppressive therapy is common in patients with solid tumor or hematological malignancies. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to hepatitis flare and/or hepatic decompensation. These consequences arising from HBV reactivation are, however, largely preventable. Routine screening for HBV serologic status is recommended for all cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or biologics. By recognizing different serological patterns (which represent either overt or occult HBV infection) and the types of immunosuppressive therapies prescribed, a risk-adapted approach can be established. Prophylactic therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues (prior to or concomitantly with the commencement of immunosuppressive therapies) is more effective than pre-emptive therapy (starting antiviral when HBV DNA level is rising) in high-risk individuals. Entecavir has been proven to be more effective than lamivudine according to recent studies. Close monitoring of serum HBV level is the preferred strategy in low-risk patients. However, the optimal interval of DNA monitoring and the duration of therapy remain unknown. "

7846,0.005,5.0,"The rapidity of HIV-RNA suppression after initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) may impact immune reconstitution in developing countries, where patients initiate cART at low CD4 T cell counts. One hundred and thirty-five HIV-1 Mozambican adults initiating cART were prospectively followed over 16 months within a larger observational study. Plasma HIV-RNA, CD4 counts, and CD8 T cell activation were monitored at the pre-cART visit and at 4, 10, and 16 months during cART. Of the 89 patients with available HIV-RNA data at pre-cART and 4 and 10 months post-cART, 68% (60/89) suppressed HIV-RNA at 4 months and were defined as ""early virological controllers""(EC). Twenty of the 29 remaining patients who did not control HIV-RNA at 4 months did so at 10 months and were classified as ""late virological controllers""(LC). Nine (10%) patients did not control HIV-RNA at either time point. Both initiating an EFV-containing cART regimen and having pre-cART tuberculosis were significantly associated with early HIV-RNA suppression if locked into a multivariate model [EFV OR: 13.6 (95% CI 1.7; 108.1) p = 0.014) tuberculosis OR: 11.0 (95% CI 1.4; 87.9) p = 0.024]. EC demonstrated significantly lower median activated CD8 T cells at 4, 10, and 16 months post-cART than did LC. Approximately 63% (12/19) of LC experienced reappearance of detectable HIV-RNA at 6 months postcontrol as compared to 15% (2/60) of EC (p = 0.001). This study suggests that rapid suppression of HIV-RNA may lead to a lower rate of reappearance of HIV-RNA, which could impact CD8 T cell activation levels in patients initiating cART at low CD4 counts."

Significant associations were found between HAV and HBV infection, HAV and HCV infection, and HBV and HCV infection. Predictors of total co-infections included age of first injection, lifetime years in jail, and Hispanic ethnicity. Latinos had the highest proportion of HAV and HBV co-infection with HCV. The total number of co-infections, especially those co-infected with all three of the hepatitis infections, was unexpectedly high."

This article systematically reviews recent research advances in the possible barriers of hepatitis B care in APIAs that can be classified into three major categories, i.e., provider-, patient-, and resource-related barriers. The article also provides an overview of multiple approaches to effectively reduce these barriers so that we can evolve better strategy and deliver appropriate care to this special population and eventually reduce health disparity of CHB in APIAs."
3134,0.005,5.0,"As a result of shared modes of transmission, chronic hepatitis C infection is common in HIV-infected patients, particularly among those who have used injection drugs as well as men who have sex with men (MSMs). In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, HCV infection has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Over the last decade, treatment with peginterferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) has been recommended for coinfected patients who are at the greatest risk for liver disease; however, the effectiveness of HCV treatment in this population has been disappointing. Challenges to the use of HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, patients with HIV/HCV coinfection include the potential for interactions between different drugs, addition of drug toxicities, and the need for therapy with PEG-IFN. Despite these challenges, limited data indicate that telaprevir and boceprevir given in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV increase the rate of viral suppression in coinfected patients with manageable toxicity and drug-drug interaction profile. Accordingly, these agents may be recommended for HCV treatment in carefully selected HIV-infected persons."

Median age at presentation was 67 years, and five were female. Nine were asymptomatic at presentation, six presented with varices, five with malaise, three with abdominal pain, one with pruritus and one with oedema. Risk factors identified were: transfusion (7), haemodialysis (1), health care worker (dentist) (1), and tattoos (2). There was no recognized risk factor for infection in 14, but five of these had done military service in areas of high HCV prevalence. Liver biopsy in 20 showed chronic hepatitis in two, cirrhosis in 12, and cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in six. Three additional patients also developed hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV genotyping was done in 19 and all were type 1 (1a, 4; 1b, 14; 1 untypable, 1).

4239,0.005,5.0,"The progressive loss of immunological memory during aging correlates with a reduced proliferative capacity and shortened telomeres of T cells. Growing evidence suggests that this phenotype is recapitulated during chronic viral infection. The antigenic volume imposed by persistent and latent viruses exposes the immune system to unique challenges that lead to host T-cell exhaustion, characterized by impaired T-cell functions. These dysfunctional memory T cells lack telomerase, the protein capable of extending and stabilizing chromosome ends, imposing constraints on telomere dynamics. A deleterious consequence of this excessive telomere shortening is the premature induction of replicative senescence of viral-specific CD8+ memory T cells. While senescent cells are unable to expand, they can survive for extended periods of time and are more resistant to apoptotic signals. This review takes a closer look at T-cell exhaustion in chronic viruses known to cause human disease: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis B/C/D virus (HBV/HCV/HDV), human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus-1/2(HSV-1/2), and Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV). Current literature linking T-cell exhaustion with critical telomere lengths and immune senescence are discussed. The concept that enduring antigen stimulation leads to T-cell exhaustion that favors telomere attrition and a cell fate marked by enhanced T-cell senescence appears to be a common endpoint to chronic viral infections."
3059,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important cause of human chronic liver diseases and is a major public health problem. Viral load and HBV genotype play critical roles in determining clinical outcomes and response to antiviral treatment in hepatitis B patients. Viral genotype detection and quantification assays are currently in use with different levels of effectiveness. In this study, the performance of a real-time genotyping and quantitative PCR (GQ-PCR)-based assay was evaluated. Through the use of genotype-specific primers and probes, this assay provides simultaneous identification and quantification of genotypes B and C in a single reaction. Our GQ-PCR correctly identified all predefined genotypes B and C, and no cross-reaction between genotypes B and C were observed. The GQ-PCR identified more cases of HBV infections with mixed genotypes B and C than direct sequencing did. Samples from 127 HBV-infected Chinese patients were genotyped with GQ-PCR, revealing 56.7% HBV as genotype B, 13.4% as genotype C, and 29.8% as mixed genotypes B and C. This assay provides a reliable, efficient, and cost-effective means for quantification of the B and C genotypes of HBV in single or mixed infections. This assay is suitable for sequential monitoring of viral load levels and for determining the relationship between the genotype viral load and stage of disease in Asians."
3666,0.005,5.0,"Active TB in HIV-1-infected subjects is associated with increased HIV-1-related immunodeficiency and mortality. We assessed plasma viral load in HIV-1-infected patients with pulmonary TB (HIV/TB) and non-TB symptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (HIV). HIV-1 load was higher in HIV/TB compared with HIV at higher CD4 counts (> 500/microl) (P < 0.01), but not at lower CD4 counts (< 500/microl). We also evaluated the status of HIV-1 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum from HIV/TB and CD4-matched healthy HIV-infected patients (HIV/C) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction over a range of CD4 (> 900/microl to < 200/microl). HIV-1 RNA in serum and PBMC correlated to one another, and both were markedly higher in HIV/TB compared with HIV/C with higher CD4 counts. Also, during a longitudinal study of anti-tuberculous chemoprophylaxis in HIV-1-infected patients, 10 subjects who developed TB had serologies before, at the time, and after the diagnosis of TB. These HIV/TB patients had an increase in viral load (average 2.5-fold) at the time of diagnosis of TB (P < 0.05). Overall, these data indicate that the transcriptional activity of HIV-1 is enhanced in HIV-1-infected patients with active TB, especially during early HIV-1 disease. As TB often is an early HIV-1 opportunistic infection, it may particularly favour early viral replication and dissemination, and therefore contribute to progression of HIV-1 disease."
2984,0.005,5.0,"The objective was to evaluate the association between antiretroviral therapy and AIDS mortality in New York City (NYC). Design was a population-based case-control study. We randomly selected 150 case patients and 150 control patients whose AIDS diagnosis was made during 1994 to 1996 (male:female, 2:1) from among 19,238 persons reported to the NYC Health Department HIV/AIDS Reporting System (HARS). Case patients had died of AIDS-related causes in 1996. Control patients, category matched with case patients on gender, were not known to have died by the end of 1996. Analysis was performed on 279 patients (142 cases and 137 controls). Cases and controls were similar in age, gender, race, HIV transmission category, and health insurance coverage. The median baseline CD4 count was 30 cells/microL for those who died and 103 cells/microL for survivors (p < 0.001). The prescription of HAART (antiretroviral combination that includes at least one protease inhibitor) in 1996 was strongly associated with survival in univariate analysis (OR = 5.1, 95%CI = 2.5-10.2). This association remained in a logistic regression analysis after adjusting for sex, age, race, health insurance status, HIV transmission categories, year of AIDS diagnosis, baseline CD4 count, and other antiretroviral therapy (AOR = 8.6, 95%CI = 3.5-20.7). Prescription of combination therapy other than HAART in 1996 and baseline CD4 count were also associated with survival, but less strongly so. The survival benefit of HAART extends beyond the confines of a few highly selected patients into the ""real world,"" reducing AIDS deaths at the population level. This population-based study supports the likelihood that the introduction of HAART in 1996 played a primary role in the decline in NYC AIDS mortality."
1307,0.005,5.0,"Hemodialysis patients potentially have an increased risk of infection with parenterally transmitted viral agents due to an impaired host immune response and multiple transfusion requirements. Viral hepatitis is considered as a problem for hemodialysis patients because 1.9% of all deaths among this population are related to the consequence of viral hepatitis. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most important causes of transmitted infections by the parenteral route in hemodialysis patients. Occult HBV infection is characterized by presence of HBV infection without detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), which harbors potential risk of HBV transmission through hemodialysis. There are conflicting reports on the prevalence of occult HBV infection (OBI) in hemodialysis patients. Considering the importance of occult HBV infection in hemodialysis patients and the growing evidence on this subject, the purpose of this review is to provide comprehensive information on OBI prevalence in hemodialysis patients and highlight the most important points in this issue."
6839,0.005,5.0,"Nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept, formally AG1343) is a potent and orally bioavailable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor (K(i) = 2 nM) and is being widely prescribed in combination with HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection. The current studies evaluated the presence of metabolites circulating in plasma following the oral administration of nelfinavir to healthy volunteers and HIV-infected patients, as well as the levels in plasma and antiviral activities of these metabolites. The results showed that the parent drug was the major circulating chemical species, followed in decreasing abundance by its hydroxy-t-butylamide metabolite (M8) and 3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxynelfinavir (M1). Antiviral assays with HIV-1 strain RF-infected CEM-SS cells showed that the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of nelfinavir, M8, and M1 were 30, 34, and 151 nM, respectively, and that the corresponding EC50 against another HIV-1 strain, IIIB, in MT-2 cells were 60, 86, and 653 nM. Therefore, apparently similar in vitro antiviral activities were demonstrated for nelfinavir and M8, whereas an approximately 5- to 11-fold-lower level of antiviral activity was observed for M1. The active metabolite, M8, showed a degree of binding to human plasma proteins similar to that of nelfinavir (ca. 98%). Concentrations in plasma of nelfinavir and its metabolites in 10 HIV-positive patients receiving nelfinavir therapy (750 mg three times per day) were determined by a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay. At steady state (day 28), the mean plasma nelfinavir concentrations ranged from 1.73 to 4.96 microM and the M8 concentrations ranged from 0.55 to 1.96 microM, whereas the M1 concentrations were low and ranged from 0.09 to 0.19 microM. In conclusion, the findings from the current studies suggest that, in humans, nelfinavir forms an active metabolite circulating at appreciable levels in plasma. The active metabolite M8 may account for some of the antiviral activity associated with nelfinavir in the treatment of HIV disease."
1516,0.005,5.0,"To achieve global targets for universal treatment set forth by the Joint United Nations Programme on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (UNAIDS), viral load monitoring for HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) must become the standard of care in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) (1). CDC and other U.S. government agencies, as part of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, are supporting multiple countries in sub-Saharan Africa to change from the use of CD4 cell counts for monitoring of clinical response to ART to the use of viral load monitoring, which is the standard of care in developed countries. Viral load monitoring is the preferred method for immunologic monitoring because it enables earlier and more accurate detection of treatment failure before immunologic decline. This report highlights the initial successes and challenges of viral load monitoring in seven countries that have chosen to scale up viral load testing as a national monitoring strategy for patients on ART in response to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Countries initiating viral load scale-up in 2014 observed increases in coverage after scale-up, and countries initiating in 2015 are anticipating similar trends. However, in six of the seven countries, viral load testing coverage in 2015 remained below target levels. Inefficient specimen transport, need for training, delays in procurement and distribution, and limited financial resources to support scale-up hindered progress. Country commitment and effective partnerships are essential to address the financial, operational, technical, and policy challenges of the rising demand for viral load monitoring. "
5219,0.005,5.0,"Important progress has been made in recent years in the development and clinical use of drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Nevertheless, when antiretroviral therapy fails to be fully suppressive, new viral variants emerge, thus allowing HIV-1 to escape from drug pressure by accumulating mutations. Between 50% and 70% of treated patients with virological rebound harbour some form of drug-resistant virus; transmitted drug resistance in drug-naïve populations has reached 5-20% in areas of the world with access to treatment. The emergence of drug-resistant viruses remains the limiting factor in HIV-1 management, being a major cause of treatment failure, and being associated with clinical progression and death. All international guidelines focus on the importance of tailoring antiretroviral therapy to the individual patient, on the basis onf HIV-1 genetic data, integrated with clinical, laboratory and therapeutic information. The aim of this review is to provide useful information to clinicians and virologists about how and when to use genotypic resistance testing in clinical practice, especially in the management of the first stages of HIV-1 patient care and treatment decisions."
4625,0.005,5.0,"Twenty-four of over 24,000 patients genotyped over the past 3 years were found to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates that possess an insert in the protease gene. In this report, we evaluated the spectrum of protease gene insertion mutations in patient isolates and analyzed the effect of these various insertion mutations on viral phenotypes. The inserts were composed of 1, 2, 5, or 6 amino acids that mapped at or between codons 35 and 38, 17 and 18, 21 and 25, or 95 and 96. Reduced susceptibility to protease inhibitors was found in isolates which possess previously reported drug resistance mutations. Fitness assays, including replication and competition experiments, showed that most of the isolates with inserts grew somewhat better than their counterparts with a deletion of the insert. These experiments demonstrate that, rarely, insertion mutations can develop in the HIV type 1 protease gene, are no more resistant than any other sequences which have similar associated resistance mutations, and can provide a borderline advantage in replication."
5796,0.005,5.0,"The molecular epidemiological study of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Indonesia is still limited. This study was aimed to identify the prevalence of HBV pre-S deletion/insertion mutations, and to assess the association of pre-S deletion mutation with liver disease progression in Indonesia. Pre-S mutations were identified by direct sequencing. Of the 265 subjects, 32 samples (12.1%) harbored pre-S deletion/insertion mutations. The prevalence of those pre-S mutations was 2.7% (2/75), 12.9% (8/62), 16.7% (11/66), and 17.7% (11/62) in asymptomatic carrier, chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma groups, respectively. Statistical analysis showed significant difference among them (P = 0.024). In HBV genotype B (HBV/B), pre-S1, pre-S1/S2, and pre-S2 deletion mutations were detected respectively in 3 (17.6%), 4 (23.5%), and 9 (52.9%) of 17 samples. On the other hand, in HBV/C, 12 of 15 samples (80.0%) showed a pre-S2 deletion mutation, and only 2 samples (13.3%) demonstrated a pre-S1/S2 deletion mutation. These results suggest that in HBV/B deletion mutation tends to occur in pre-S1 or pre-S1/S2 region, while in HBV/C the deletion mutation usually occurs in the pre-S2 region. Analysis of complete genome of four viruses confirmed that 3 isolates were classified into HBV/B3, and 1 isolate was HBV/C1. However, SimPlot and BootScan analyses showed that isolate 08.10.002 was an intragenotypic recombinant between HBV/B3 and HBV/B4. As conclusion, the prevalence of HBV pre-S mutations was relatively low in Indonesian patients compared to those from Taiwan, Japan, and other Asian countries. There was a weak association between pre-S deletion mutation and progressive liver disease."
5872,0.005,5.0,"Many HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) continue to use illicit substances despite being in substance use treatment. Substance use is associated with non-adherence to HIV medications; however underlying mechanisms regarding this relation are understudied. The current investigation examined the role of substance use coping in terms of the relation between substance use and HIV medication adherence. Participants were 121 HIV-infected IDUs (41 % female, M age = 47, SD = 7.1) in opioid dependence treatment. Participants completed self-report questionnaires, were administered clinical interviews and oral toxicology screens, and used a medication-event-monitoring-system cap to assess 2 week HIV medication adherence. The use of cocaine and multiple substances were significantly related to decreased medication adherence. Substance use coping mediated these associations. Findings highlight the importance of assessing, monitoring, and targeting ongoing substance use, and ways to increase positive coping for HIV-infected IDUs in substance use treatment to aid in HIV medication adherence."
8508,0.005,5.0,"We and others have shown that in individual human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, the adaptive evolution of HIV-1 is influenced by host immune competence. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that in addition to selective forces operating within the host, transmission bottlenecks have an impact on HIV-1 intrahost evolution. Therefore, we studied the intrahost evolution of the V3 region of the external glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1 during the 3- and 5-year periods following seroconversion after parenteral versus sexual (male-to-male) transmission in 41 participants of the Amsterdam prospective cohorts of homosexual men (n = 31) and intravenous drug users (IVDUs; n = 10) who were AIDS free and had comparable numbers of CD4+ cells. We observed that HIV-1 strains in homosexual men accumulated over 5 years more nonsynonymous substitutions within the V3 loop than HIV-1 strains in IVDUs as a result of lower rates of nonsynonymous evolution in both the initial 3-year period from seroconversion and the following 2-year period as well as a larger proportion of nonsynonymous back substitutions in IVDUs. The mean numbers of synonymous substitutions did not differ between the two risk groups. Since HIV-1 strains in IVDUs could be distinguished from the viruses of homosexual men based on several nucleotide substitutions of which the most conserved is a synonymous substitution at the tip of the V3 loop (GGC pattern), we studied whether the founder virus population itself has an impact on the intrahost evolution of HIV-1. The mean number of nonsynonymous substitutions accumulated over 5 years within the V3 loop was lower in 10 IVDUs infected by the HIV-1 strains with the GGC signature than in 4 IVDUs infected by HIV-1 strains lacking this pattern, while the mean numbers of synonymous substitutions were similar in the two groups."
5450,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global major health problem. Currently, 10 genotypes (A-J) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are identified based on the nucleic acid sequence heterogeneity, and these genotypes have been shown to have distinct geographic distribution. Reports of the previous studies indicated that the genotype D is the predominant type among hepatitis B patients in different regions of Turkey. However, recent studies indicated that other HBV genotypes are also seen with an increasing rate. Although epidemiological and clinical information on genotype E infection is currently limited, it is known that genotype E infection is common in West and Central Africa. In this report, the first case of HBV genotype E infection in Turkey was presented. A 22-year-old Nigerian male employee who resided in Manisa for five years was admitted to Celal Bayar University Hospital Manisa, Turkey, for his routine check-up. Since HBsAg was found positive, other HBV markers were tested with a repeated serum sample. Laboratory findings were as follows; HBsAg (+), anti-HBs (-), HBeAg (-), anti-HBe (+), anti-HBc (+), anti-HCV (-), anti-HIV (-), ALT: 44 U/L and AST: 45 U/L. HBV-DNA level was detected as 700 IU/ml by real-time PCR (Artus HBV QS RGQ Qiagen, Germany). HBV-DNA isolated from the serum sample of the patient was amplified by PCR and polymerase gene segment of HBV was directly sequenced. UPGMA method was used for phylogenetic analysis and Inno-LIPA HBV genotyping method (Innogenetics, Belgium) was performed to determine multiple HBV genotype infection. On the basis of those methods the genotype of the virus was identified as genotype E. The partial sequences of the HBV polymerase gene were loaded to the international DNA data bank (GenBank) for contribution to the global HBV surveillance. This report emphasized that besides genotype D the other HBV genotypes could be found in Turkey. Since the patient was an inactive HBsAg carrier before his residence in Turkey, this case was regarded as an imported HBV genotype E case. In conclusion, detection of different HBV genotypes, their epidemiology and molecular characteristics are important for both national and global HBV surveillance and better clinical approach. "

We report a case of spontaneous recovery of chronic HCV-infection in a HCV-HIV co-infected hemophiliac with the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy and immune restoration. Retrospective analysis of frozen blood samples showed that a decrease in HCV-RNA in parallel with the increase of CD4 and CD8-cell counts, accompanied by a peak of transaminases.

33,0.005,5.0,"We report on the frequency of genetic mutations associated with drug resistance in antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from Martinique (French West Indies), where zidovudine (ZDV) has been available since 1987 and where combination therapy developed simultaneously with its use in continental France. Genotypic resistance was studied in plasma HIV RNA from samples collected between 1988 and 1998 from 70 antiretroviral-naive study subjects, half presenting with either primary infection or documented seroconversion. A line probe assay (LIPA) was used to detect substitutions on the reverse transcriptase (RT) codons 41, 69, 70, 74, 184, and 215. Direct sequencing was used to complete the data for RT codons which were uninterpretable by LIPA. Of these patients, 17 harbored mutated viruses with one or more mutations in the RT gene codons analyzed. ZDV resistance mutations T215Y/F, M41L, and K70R were found in 2, 5, and 12 individuals, respectively. Mutant strains L74V (didanosine [ddI] and dideoxycytidine [ddC]) were detected in 3 patients and M184V (lamivudine/ddI/ddC) in 4 patients. However, pure mutant results at one or more codons of interest were observed in only 5 (7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-13%) patients, all involving ZDV resistance. One carried both mutations T215Y and M41L known to confer a high degree of phenotypic resistance to ZDV. Among a subgroup of 28 patients with a timepoint of infection after 1995, 24 [86%; approximately 95% CI, 73%-99%) presented with a wild-type pattern. The significance of the high prevalence of mixed patterns observed in drug-naive patients remains unclear. However, the frequency of primary mutant genotypes associated with high levels of drug resistance is low in Martinique and in this study we did not observe any currently increased tendency in this frequency."
307,0.005,5.0,"In this observational single-center cohort study outside the clinical trial setting, outcome and predictors of virologic failure of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) containing a protease inhibitor were evaluated in human immunodeficiency (HIV)-infected persons. The study population consisted of 807 protease inhibitor-naive HIV-seropositive patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy with reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors (indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir) between January 1997 and January 1999. Demographic variable, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+ T-cell count, adverse drug reactions, and adherence to HAART were assessed. Virologic treatment response was defined as a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA load from baseline to below 500 copies per milliliter after 12 months of therapy. Levels of HIV-1 RNA were undetectable in 43% of patients at 12 months. Factors associated with failure to suppress viral load included age 40 years or younger, baseline CD4+ T cell count less than 200 x 10(6) per liter baseline viral load greater than 4.3 log(10) per milliliter, and non-adherence to HAART. After adjustment by logistic regression, non-adherence was the only statistically significant variable associated with virologic failure (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.67). Unselected patients in whom protease inhibitor is started in a usual clinical setting achieve viral suppression less frequently than do patients in controlled clinical trials. Failure to adherence to HAART was the strongest predictor of virologic failure."
5487,0.005,5.0,"Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) receive numerous medications from multiple providers. As a result, it is important that medication usage is properly documented in each patient's medical record. Lack of adequate documentation may confound a provider's assessment of drug efficacy, potentially leading to an increased incidence of drug interactions and adverse effects. The objective of this study was to determine if discrepancies exist between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record by healthcare providers. Data were obtained using structured telephone surveys and medical chart review. Study participants were recruited from the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center AIDS Clinic. Results obtained for 41 patients demonstrated discrepancies between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record ranging from 9 to 92 percent, depending on the class of drug. The largest differences were observed with the ""as-needed"" class of drugs: benzodiazepines (92 percent), morphine (60 percent), and codeine (56 percent). Differences were also noted for scheduled medications: ketoconazole (54 percent), clotrimazole (45 percent), acyclovir (38 percent), zidovudine (15 percent), and pentamidine (9 percent). These observed discrepancies reaffirm the need for accurate exchange of information between provider and patient to promote the most effective, rational, and safe drug therapy. Careful reviews of medication usage at each visit and use of pharmacy-based medication profiles are potential mechanisms to improve documentation of medication usage in HIV-infected patients."
2102,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive individuals who adhere to their antiretroviral (ARV) regimens are more likely to achieve suppressed HIV viral load and improved immunologic response; however, for most patients, medication adherence remains a challenge. Prior studies have shown that clinical pharmacists contribute to the management of HIV-infected patients; but due to variability in clinical responsibilities and study limitations, their value has not been fully realized. The objective of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes of an HIV clinical pharmacist's interventions at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, who utilizes medication expertise to provide recommendations for ARV regimen changes. The pharmacist suggests new ARV regimens in order to attain virologic suppression, improve immunologic response, or minimize ARV adverse effects, while aiming to optimize patients' adherence by decreasing pill burden and/or dosing frequency. This retrospective study assessed the effectiveness of the pharmacist's interventions that occurred between 11 September 2006 and 30 September 2008 on pill burden, dosing frequency, and medication adherence. Additionally, CD4+ cell count and HIV viral load pre- and post-intervention were evaluated. Medication adherence was assessed utilizing electronic pharmacy refill records and calculated based on the formula: [(pills dispensed/pills prescribed per day)/days between refills] x 100. From a cohort of 75 patients, mean daily pill quantity and dosing frequency decreased from 7.2 pills/day and 2.0 times/day in the control phase to 5.4 pills/day and 1.5 times/day in the study phase, respectively ( p < 0.001). Medication adherence increased from a mean of 81% in the control phase to 89% in the study phase ( p = 0.003). Clinical outcomes measured by CD4+cell count and CD4% were statistically improved and more individuals achieved undetectable HIV viral loads postintervention ( p < 0.001). In conclusion, HIV clinical pharmacists may play an important role in reducing pill burden and dosing frequency, increasing medication adherence, and improving clinical outcomes."
741,0.005,5.0,"Despite disproportionate rates of HIV among transgender women and evidence that medication adherence is necessary for treatment success and increased likelihood of survival, there has been little investigation into antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence issues among transgender women. This study examined rates of self-reported ART adherence among transgender women on ART (n = 35) and well-established correlates of nonadherence, including depression, adherence self-efficacy, patient perceptions of interactions with their providers, and perceived adverse side effects of ART compared to other respondents (n = 2,770). Transgender women on ART were less likely to report 90% adherence rates or higher and reported less confidence in their abilities to integrate treatment regimens into their daily lives. When transgender women were compared to other respondents, regardless of the current medication regimen, they reported significantly fewer positive interactions with their health care providers. Training for providers and integration of hormone therapy into HIV care is recommended."
6514,0.005,5.0,"Alcohol-antiretroviral therapy (ART) interactive toxicity beliefs reflect perceived adverse outcomes of mixing alcohol and ART. Previous research has shown a significant relationship between alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and ART non-adherence, over and above other correlates of non-adherence such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)symptoms and frequency of alcohol use. Most past studies have collected data over extended periods and have not determined if alcohol use and missed medications occur at the day-level among people holding interactive toxicity beliefs. Previous daily analyses, however, have been limited by self-reported adherence and relatively short periods of observation. To address these gaps in the literature, men and women living with HIV in Atlanta, GA, were enrolled in a 45-day observational cohort study. Daily alcohol use was collected using two-way interactive text message surveys and daily adherence was collected via the Wisepill device. Fifty-seven participants completed a measure of alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and contributed 2565 days of daily data. Participants who endorsed high levels of interactive toxicity beliefs had significantly more days when they missed doses of medication. Alcohol-antiretroviral toxicity beliefs predicted missing doses of medication on days when participants were drinking and on days when they were not drinking. Multilevel multivariate regressions showed that these toxicity beliefs predicted daily missed doses of medication over and above quantity of alcohol consumed, depression and general medication concerns. This study replicates and extends previous literature and indicates the necessity of addressing alcohol-ART toxicity beliefs within adherence interventions."
8240,0.005,5.0,"A survey of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) regarding human immunodeficiency virus infection was performed on 899 students from 3 government-administered high schools located in the Bangkok Metropolitan area. Initially, all students completed a written questionnaire (pre-test) regarding HIV/AIDS. Following this, they attended a slide lecture presentation given by a specialist physician. The same test questionnaire was then completed by the same students six weeks (post-test) later for comparison of their previous KAP. The subjects composed of male to female ratio equal to that of the median age 15-16 years old. Sixty-seven per cent of the subjects were living with their parents, 16.3 per cent with relatives and 15 per cent with friends. Ninety nine per cent of the subjects had received information on HIV/AIDS before enrollment to this study. The source of knowledge ranged from television (89.1%), teachers (81.6%), pamphlets (80.2%), newspapers (75%), radio (55%), health care workers (53.4%), friends (38.6%) and only 32.5 per cent from their parents. The subjects' knowledge about HIV/AIDS and risk factors in the post-test questionnaire was significantly increased (P < 0.001) from the pre-test status. However, their attitudes to an HIV infected person were not significantly changed in the post-test questionnaire: only the ""attending school"" question showed significantly (P < 0.05) increased numbers of agreement. Similarly, the attitudes and practices to prevent HIV infection were not significantly (P > 0.05) different between pre-test and post-test questionnaires. The result of this study is to recommend regular school-based programs of education to increase awareness of preventive strategies for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases."
2353,0.005,5.0,"Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in a significant decrease of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) morbidity and mortality, the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia (HAD) has actually risen, due to the increasing life expectancy of the infected subjects. To date, several aspects of the HAD pathogenesis remain to be dissected. In particular, the viral-cellular protein interplay is still under investigation. Given their specific features, two viral proteins, Tat and Nef, have been mainly hypothesized to play a role in HIV neuropathology. Here we show that HIV-1 Nef has an effect on the transcriptional levels of a cellular protein, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), that is preferentially expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system at late embryonic stages. By its overexpression along with Nef, the authors demonstrate ALK ability to influence, at least in the U87MG astrocytic glioma cells, the mytogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-K)-dependent pathway. Moreover, although in the absence of a physical direct interaction, Nef and ALK activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are likely to contribute to blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage in HAD. Finally, in the in vitro model of glioblastoma cells adopted, Nef and ALK show similar effects by increasing different cytochines/chemokines that may be relevant for HAD pathogenesis. If confirmed in vivo, these data may indicate that, thanks to its ability to interfere with specific cellular pathways involved in BBB damage and in central nervous system (CNS) integrity, Nef, along with specific cellular counterparts, could be one of the viral players implicated in HAD development."

This propensity is more pronounced in AIDS, where opportunistic parasitic infections may cause severe diarrhea, marked absorptive dysfunction, and significant risk of mortality. There are scant data regarding parasitic infections among HIV patients in the developed world; most studies and research come from povertystricken areas of South Africa, India, Iran, and the South Pacific. Although multiple infections with the same or different parasites have been reported, simultaneous infections are rare. We present the case of a 35-year-old man who developed a co-infection with Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides, simultaneously, the diagnosis being made after the judicious evaluation of a stool sample. Given the associated morbidity, prompt diagnosis and treatment are needed to avoid further complications in patients with HIV. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of triple parasitic infection in a patient with HIV. "

The stool samples were processed by water-ether sedimentation method; they were stained with Uvitex-2B technique for microscopic detection of intestinal microsporidium. A portion of all samples were preserved in 200microl PBS containing 2% PVPP ((Polyvinylpolypyrolidone) for confirmation with PCR. 18/105(17.2%) of the cases were positive for intestinal microsporidial infection by at least one method. 8/105 (7.6%) positive both by microscopy and PCR and 10/105 (9.5%) were positive only by PCR. All microsporidia positive cases were also HIV positive. Based on PCR analysis, 15 Enterocytozoon bieneusi and 3 Encephalitozoon intestinalis were identified. This study has shown that intestinal microsporidiosis is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in advanced AIDS patients and this is mainly attributed to Enterocytozoon bieneusi. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of intestinal microsporidiosis in Ethiopia. It has an important implication for the understanding of the aetiology of diarrhoea in HIV/AIDS patients in the country."

Residues 79, 94, and 96 were all found to be phosphorylated, as assessed by alanine mutations. Mutation of Ser-79 to Ala abrogated effects of Vpr on cell cycle progression, whereas mutation of Ser-94 and Ser-96 had no effect.

In this study, using sequences obtained from the HIV sequence database, we compared vpu sequences from 184 preparations of various subtypes of HIV-1 from diverse geographical regions. Our analysis revealed that CRF01_AE isolates had premature stop codon mutations at the vpu gene at a much higher rate (36%) than other subtypes (0-9%). The premature stop codon mutations in vpu existed mostly at two amino acid residues: the methionine initiation codon and the boundary between the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains. The mutations at the latter site were more often detected in CRF01_AE. The higher mutation rates at vpu in CRF01_AE were confirmed by sequence comparison of polymerase chain reaction products newly obtained directly from the DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but not from the RNA from the plasma, in CRF01_AE- and subtype B-infected individuals. This finding may indicate the possibility that the more abundant population of HIV-1 CRF01_AE is able to induce apoptosis in CD4+ T lymphocytes than the populations of other subtypes."

Out of 297 students, 10.8% had one or more serologic markers of HBV infection; none was hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. No significant difference in seropositivity was detected among students in relation to sex, age, or possible risk factors investigated. Out of 526 practitioners, 2.3% were positive for HBsAg, and 37.3% were antibody positive. The seropositivity increased progressively with age and years of professional experience, reaching the highest proportion in dentists with 30 years or more of practice (79.3%). Of those who had suffered from clinical hepatitis during their curriculum, 81.1% were seropositive compared with 34.5% observed in dentists without a prior clinical history of viral hepatitis. The proportion of seropositive dentists did not vary significantly with a history of blood transfusion, size of their practice, presence or absence (or unawareness) of subjects at high risk for HBV infection among their patients. The seropositivity was significantly lower in dentists who routinely adopted mask and gloves (21.1%) compared with those who never and/or occasionally used such barriers (46.3%). The result of the study confirmed that hepatitis B does remain a significant hazard for dental professionals, hence immunization with hepatitis B vaccine should be delivered early in their employment."

From May 15, 1988, to Sept. 30, 1989, physicians from four collaborating centres collected data on the serologic status, demographic characteristics and risk factors for 4209 patients who underwent HIV antibody testing. Of the 3899 subjects included in the study 7.9% were HIV positive. Through logistic regression analysis the following variables were found to be significantly associated with HIV seropositivity: presence of HIV-related symptoms (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 36.5), origin from an endemic area (POR 9.1), homosexuality or bisexuality (POR 8.4), intravenous drug use (POR 4.2), male sex (POR 2.8), previous HIV antibody testing (POR 2.5) and previous sexually transmitted disease (POR 1.8). Over the study period we found a large increase in HIV seroprevalence among intravenous drug users (4.2% in 1988 to 19.0% in 1989) (p = 0.02). This increase might reflect a recent change in the epidemiologic pattern of HIV transmission in Quebec. Surveillance of HIV seropositivity through a network of sentinel physicians may be a reasonable alternative to mandatory reporting."
1806,0.005,5.0,"The Patient Knowledge Assessment Study (PKAS) was conducted among 107 male hemophilic patients, aged 15 to 67 years, at 19 hemophilia treatment centers (HTC). Participants were given a 30-item questionnaire concerning the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the groups at risk, and modes of transmission. The questionnaire included questions on the participant's status in regard to antibody to human T-lymphotropic retrovirus, type III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus (HTLV-III/LAV), and the meaning of this test result. HTC health-care providers were asked to complete a separate questionnaire containing 17 questions about information given patients concerning their HTLV-III/LAV antibody status and its meaning. Overall, patients had a good base of knowledge about AIDS; however, there were gaps in this knowledge. Twenty-nine percent of patients did not know that spouses of AIDS patients were at risk for AIDS; 47% did not know that sexual partners of persons with hemophilia were at risk; and 32% did not know that hemophilic children were at risk. Further, only 69% understood that antibody-positive individuals had had contact with the AIDS virus. Identifying these and other areas of misunderstanding will provide the information needed to design educational strategies and psychosocial support programs appropriate for the hemophilic population, and which may serve as a model for other populations."
7811,0.005,5.0,"Virological data on chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Greece are limited. HBV genotypes, surface antigen (HBsAg) subtypes, and HBsAg ""a"" determinant mutations among patients infected chronically with HBV, were investigated. Serum samples from 135 HBsAg positive patients were tested. Serologic (HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe), virologic (HBV-DNA quantitation) and biochemical markers (serum alanine aminotransferase/ALT and aspartate aminotransferase/AST) were analyzed. HBV genotypes and HBsAg subtypes were determined by partial sequencing of the S gene. Genotyping was performed by using the National Center for Biotechnology Information online Genotyping tool and phylogenetic analysis. Nucleotide sequences were aligned pair wise with ClustalW and phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method. Sequences were also used to predict HBV HBsAg subtypes. In six patients (4%), simultaneous presence of HBsAg and anti-HBs was determined, whereas 47 patients (35%) were HBeAg positive, 84 (62.5%) were anti-HBe positive, and four patients (3%) were characterized by the simultaneous presence of HBeAg and anti-HBe. Mean ALT was 238 IU/L (standard deviation = 576.84), and HBV-DNA levels ranged from 1.02 × 10(5) to 2.2 × 10(7) IU/ml. Genotype D was predominant (98%), with viral groups D/ayw2 (73%) and D/ayw3 (27%). Group A/adw accounted for 1% of cases. Genotypes B and C were found exclusively in the Chinese immigrants (1%). Single or multiple point mutations were found in 35 cases (26%). Some of the most common mutations occurred at amino acid positions 129, 133, 134, 144, 145, including the ""vaccine escape"" mutation G145R. Mutations analysis revealed that amino acid substitutions did not affect detection by commercial immunoassays."
3643,0.005,5.0,"In a retrospective study of 648 persons with HIV infection in Cambodia, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to start antiretroviral treatment based on clinical criteria alone or based on a combination of clinical symptoms and the total lymphocyte count. As a reference test, we used the 2003 WHO criteria, including the CD4 count. The 2003 WHO clinical criteria had a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 57%, and an accuracy of 89% to identify patients who need highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In our clinic, with a predominance of patients with advanced disease, the 2003 WHO clinical criteria alone was a good predictor of those needing HAART. A total lymphocyte count as an extra criterion did not improve the accuracy. Nine percent of patients were wrongly identified to be in need of HAART. Among them, almost 50% had a CD4 count of more than 500 cells/muL, and 73% had weight loss of more than 10% as a stage-defining condition. Our data suggest that, in settings with limited access to CD4 count testing, it might be useful to target this test to patients in WHO stage 3 whose staging is based on weight loss alone, to avoid unnecessary treatment."
7666,0.005,5.0,"National programmes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination are recommended by the World Health Organization for all countries. Countries suffering the highest burden of HBV disease are those most needy of universal vaccination, but are frequently of very low income and resources for health care are scarce. The introduction of HBV vaccination would inevitably stretch these resources further even with support of donor agencies. Thus an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of HBV vaccination is desirable to assist in decision making about resource allocation. We describe here a method for estimating the additional costs of introducing HBV vaccination into the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) at a national level. Of fundamental importance is that this method enables costs to be assessed prior to the introduction of vaccination. We illustrate the method using a study carried out at the sub-national level, in the city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, but which can be expanded countrywide. The method, in brief, involved the use of a number of questionnaires which could be used to estimate the costs associated with the EPI programme from a large sample of the static clinics as well as from central sources. Since unit costs were collected along with the quantities of resources used and estimates of the capacity used for certain facilities (such as refrigerators), the additional cost of introducing HBV vaccine could be estimated largely by extrapolation of the resources used in vaccinating against diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus vaccine (which, similar to HBV vaccine, requires three doses). The estimation of costs is only part of the information required to make decisions on resource allocation, and should be used in association with measures of the burden of disease due to the infection in the community and effectiveness of the control programme at reducing this burden. The prediction of the latter, based upon a sound epidemiological understanding of the infection, is the subject of a forthcoming paper."
3208,0.005,5.0,"While the expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa has reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV/AIDS, it has increased concern about drug resistance. The Microbicide Trials Network 009 study assessed the prevalence of drug-resistance mutations among women at clinical sites in Durban, South Africa who tested seropositive for HIV-1 at screening for the VOICE trial. The objective of this paper was to identify characteristics and behaviors associated with drug resistance. Factors found to be significantly associated with increased resistance were high perceived risk of getting HIV and prior participation in a microbicide trial, a likely proxy for familiarity with the health care system. Two factors were found to be significantly associated with reduced resistance: having a primary sex partner and testing negative for HIV in the past year. Other variables hypothesized to be important in identifying women with resistant virus, including partner or friend on ART who shared with the participant and being given antiretrovirals during pregnancy or labor, or the proxy variable-number of times given birth in a health facility-were not significantly associated. The small number of participants with resistant virus and the probable underreporting of sensitive behaviors likely affected our ability to construct a comprehensive profile of the type of HIV-positive women at greatest risk of developing resistance mutations.

5506,0.005,5.0,"Genetic variation during the course of infection of an individual is a remarkable feature of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease. This variation has been studied for the envelope protein encoding regions of seventeen different sequences from various isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using multiple sequence comparison and calculation of variability. The open regions with little intramolecular base pairing in these envelope sequences are predicted by a recently developed statistical method. The minimum length L for a run of hypervariable sites, conserved sites, or open regions that gives significance at the 1% (or 0.1%) level is then determined by a scan statistical method. The results show that significant clusters of open regions predicted at the RNA levels correlate with significant clusters of hypervariable sites in the HIV envelope gene. Those significant genomic variations in HIVs seem to be manifested mainly in the extracellular portion of the envelope protein. Twelve potential antigenic determinants are predicted using an antigenic index method. Interestingly, the majority of the significant hypervariable regions in the exterior envelope protein (gp120) were predicted potential epitopes."

9785,0.005,5.0,Five hundred and ten inner city adolescent girls requesting reproductive health services were surveyed about their knowledge and beliefs concerning human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Each patient's survey responses were examined in relation to number of sexual partners and history of a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Adolescents with the greatest concerns and fears of contracting acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were those with multiple sexual partners. Those with the joint effects of multiple sexual partners and a history of STD were the most likely to acknowledge their potential for HIV infection and have a behavioral basis for it. Sexual behaviors within this age group are highlighted and programmatic interventions are suggested.

4607,0.005,5.0,"Maternal samples were assessed from 96 women enrolled in Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 076 to determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genotypic zidovudine resistance at entry, if zidovudine resistance developed on study, and the role of zidovudine resistance in vertical transmission of HIV-1 despite zidovudine therapy. Low and high levels of genotypic resistance were assessed by differential hybridization, oligoligation, or direct sequencing of plasma HIV-1 RNA for codons K70R and T215Y/F. None of the women had high-level genotypic resistance to zidovudine at study entry or delivery. For low-level zidovudine resistance, the 95% confidence intervals were 0.3%-6.8% for baseline prevalence and 0.3%-14% for delivery incidence. Low-level zidovudine resistance, adjusted for plasma viral RNA level at delivery, was not strongly associated with an increase in vertical transmission risk (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-131; P = .35)."
4664,0.005,5.0,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic has become a major global public health problem with rising number of cases and associated deaths. Most of the present activities in developing countries, especially in Africa, are aimed at reducing the transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Care for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is essential not only to mitigate the impacts of HIV/AIDS among PLWHA but is also an important component of prevention of the disease. There is now a general recognition that comprehensive care across the continuum should be provided to PLWHA through all the stages of infection, with a crucial role for community-home based care activities. In addition, AIDS orphans need to be supported Although, documented evidences abound on the utility of comprehensive care and community-home based care approaches outside Africa and in some African countries, there is little information on them in Nigeria. This paper therefore reviews the recent epidemiology of HIV infection, the many currently developed initiatives to deliver comprehensive care for PLWHA in the hospital, community and at home, and the issue of AIDS orphans. In addition, measures to effectively integrate them into the mainstream of societal activities are discussed."
6076,0.005,5.0,"The transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was studied in 647 subjects who presented no apparent risk factors for the infection other than having had promiscuous heterosexual relations, heterosexual relations with people with an elevated risk of infection, or heterosexual relations with people infected by human immunodeficiency virus. Thirty subjects were found to be seropositive for anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. The elevated risk factors included being the habitual partner of a person at risk of infection or of a person who was infected by human immunodeficiency virus, or being the partner of a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The transmission of the virus was verified in 13 of 284 subjects (4.57%) who had had heterosexual intercourse three or more times with persons at risk and in 16 of 101 subjects (15.84%) who had had heterosexual intercourse three or more times with persons who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. No significant correlation between human immunodeficiency virus infection and a history of sexually transmitted infections, nor between human immunodeficiency virus infection and female subjects was found. These data suggest that the epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome can also spread through heterosexual relations, even if the possibility of becoming infected in this way seems at the moment limited to particular risk behaviors."
1546,0.005,5.0,"Genomic rearrangements in the 5' part of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) have been involved in multidrug resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTI). We carried out a retrospective, multicenter study to investigate the prevalence, variability, and phenotypic consequences of such rearrangements. Data concerning the HIV-1 RT genotype and the biological and clinical characteristics of NRTI-treated patients were collected from 10 virology laboratories. Sensitivities of the different HIV-1 variants to RT inhibitors were analyzed in a single-cycle recombinant virus assay. Fifty-two of 2,152 (2.4%) RT sequences had a rearrangement in the 5' part of the RT, with an extensive molecular variation. The number of codons inserted between positions 68 and 69 ranged from 1 (3 samples) or 2 (41 samples) to 5 and 11 in one case each. In four cases, codon 67 was deleted. High levels of phenotypic resistance to zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), abacavir (ABC), and didanosine (ddI) were found in 95, 92, 72, 62, and 15% of the 40 samples analyzed, respectively. Resistance to AZT, d4T, and ABC could be found in the absence of the T215Y/F mutations. Resistance to 3TC could develop in the absence of specific mutations. Low-level resistance to ddI was noticed in 40% of the patients. The deletions of codon 67 seemed to have little effect on NRTI sensitivity. Most of the rearrangements were shown to contribute to cross-resistance to NRTI. The results regarding susceptibility to ddI raise the question of the interpretation of the phenotypic data concerning this drug."
5222,0.005,5.0,"There are limited data on the efficacy of T cell-based assays to detect tuberculosis (TB) antigen-specific responses in immune-deficient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in patients with HIV-1 infection, especially in those with advanced disease (CD4 T cell count < 300 cells/microl). An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, which detects interferon (IFN)-gamma secreted by T cells exposed to TB antigens, was used to assess specific immune responses in a prospective study of 201 HIV-1-infected patients with risk factors for TB infection, attending a single HIV unit. The performance of the ELISPOT assay to detect TB antigen-specific immune responses is independent of CD4 T cell counts in HIV-1 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis does not differ significantly from values obtained in immunocompetent subjects. The negative predictive value of the TB ELISPOT test is 98.2%. A positive predictive value of 86% for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis was found when the combined number of early secretory antigen target-6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein-10 (CFP-10) IFN-gamma spots to CD4 T cell count ratio was > 1.5. TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in HIV patients with low CD4 T cell counts using ELISPOT technology in a routine diagnostic laboratory and is a useful test to exclude TB infection in immune-deficient HIV-1 patients. A combination of TB antigen-specific IFN-gamma responses and CD4 T cell counts has the potential to distinguish active tuberculosis from latent infection."
8720,0.005,5.0,"One hundred thirty-four homosexual men from a prospective cohort study of AIDS risk from New York City and Washington D.C. and 139 homosexual men from a similar cohort in Copenhagen and Aarhus, Denmark were questioned regarding their sexual practices and knowledge of their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status over the previous 12 months. Seventy percent of Danish men and 63% of U.S. men participated in anal intercourse during the previous 12 months. Knowledge of one's own HIV status by itself did not have any significant effect on participation in anal intercourse, partner number, or condom use. Only 23% of U.S. men and 24% of Danish men always asked potential partners about their HIV status. However, men who did ask were very unlikely to choose a partner of opposite HIV status (p less than 0.006). Danish men were more likely to practice anal intercourse without a condom than were the U.S. men (p less than 0.0001); however, Danes were more likely to be in a concordant monogamous relationship than were the U.S. men (p less than 0.001). Fourteen percent of U.S. men and 21% of Danish men were not aware of their own HIV status and 52% of the U.S. cohort and 31% of the Danes had anal intercourse with a man whose status was unknown to them. Overall, only 32% of American and 53% of Danish homosexual men were practicing completely safe sex. We suggest that education to promote the need for awareness of one's own and one's partner's HIV status should be stressed."

5574,0.005,5.0,"Eighteen transfusion recipients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were followed prospectively with their 19 long-term sexual partners from 1986 to 1993 in California, Florida, and New York. Follow-up included clinical, behavioral, immunologic, serologic, and virologic evaluations. Two partners were already infected when seen 18 and 34 months after sexual contact began following the infectious transfusion. Four of 17 initially seronegative partners seroconverted during 23 person-years of observation. The recipient's clinical status, mononuclear cell subset variations, and time trend in CD4+ counts had no association with transmission. Individual plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) loads were stable during observation, and sexual transmission was not attributable to an upward trend or transient burst in viremia. However, recipients who transmitted HIV-1 to their sexual partners had higher mean viral RNA levels than did nontransmitting recipients (4.3 vs. 3.6 log10 copies/ml; p = 0.05). Although this series was small, the prospective observations suggest that viral load was the only characteristic in the recipient that contributed to heterosexual infectiousness."

We prospectively assessed 25(OH)D deficiency/insufficiency in a cohort of 352 HIV patients during 2009-2010. Predisposing factors were recorded and their relationship to low levels was assessed by logistic regression; a nutritional survey examined intake, nutritional status, and sunlight exposure in a subgroup of 92 patients. We studied the correlation of 25(OH)D with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) was 44.0% (95% CI, 38.8-49.4%) and insufficiency (<30 ng/ml) was 71.6% (95% CI, 66.9-76.3). Deficiency was 16.4% more prevalent in our sample than in non-HIV-infected Spaniards. Lower sunlight exposure was the only factor related to lower levels in the lifestyle and nutritional survey (p=0.045). In multiple logistic regression, higher body mass index (BMI), black race/ethnicity, lower seasonal sunlight exposure, men who have sex with men (MSM), and heterosexual transmission categories, efavirenz exposure and lack of HIV viral suppression were independently associated with deficiency/insufficiency. These variables predicted 79% of cases [AUC=0.872 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91)]. Patients receiving protease inhibitors (PIs) [OR 4.0 (95% CI, 1.3-12.3); p=0.014] or NNRTI [OR 3.6 (95% CI, 1.7-11.2); p=0.025] had higher odds of increased PTH levels; this was significant only in 25(OH)D-deficient patients (p=0.004). As in less insolated areas, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was high in HIV-infected patients in Spain; among treated patients, levels were higher with PIs than with efavirenz."
9900,0.005,5.0,"Infection with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) always occurs in association with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. We present a case of severe acute HDV infection superimposed on a previously unrecognized HBV infection, in which an interferon-sparing antiviral therapy consisting of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine was initiated and subsequently maintained. Evidence of successful suppression of HDV ribonucleic acid (RNA) was obtained after 65 weeks of TDF-based treatment. This was mirrored by a significant reduction in the levels of HBV DNA and HBV surface antigen. HDV RNA subsequently rebounded after our patient stopped antiviral therapy of his own accord. Interferon-sparing TDF-based antiviral therapy was safe and effective in achieving HDV RNA suppression in acute HDV superinfection. Further research into the utility of interferon-sparing TDF-based regimes in the treatment of acute HDV infection is needed."
3846,0.005,5.0,"Compromised oral health holds significant implications for the general health of medically vulnerable, HIV infected individuals. Past studies have reported that these individuals frequently suffer from oral opportunistic infections and have a tendency to develop severe periodontal disease. This study extends past research by examining the prevalence of oral infections according to patient characteristics and by reporting, for the first time, the level of perceived dental need in a large, multi-site sample of individuals with symptomatic HIV disease. Data for this study come from a survey of 857 clients of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's AIDS Health Services Program in 9 U.S. cities. More respondents (52%) reported a need for dental care than for any other service need. Multivariate analysis showed that clients who were white, in low-income groups, used intravenous drugs, or had a past history of oral opportunistic infections were more likely to report dental need. Relations between age, gender, insurance status, or disease status and perceived need were statistically nonsignificant. Forty-seven percent of the clients reported they had an oral opportunistic infection, the second outcome variable examined in this study. Statistically significant differences (P less than 0.05) were found in the prevalence of oral opportunistic infections among race and disease severity groups. Whites and the more severely ill were more likely to report an infection than their respective counterparts."
6451,0.005,5.0,"To investigate the dynamics of the K103N mutation following the withdrawal of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), we selected the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected patients with the mutation at the time or after the failure of an NNRTI-containing regimen from an observational database. Of 62 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 39 continued antiretroviral treatment without NNRTIs (group A), whereas 23 discontinued all antiretrovirals after NNRTI failure (group B). A total of 149 tests were analysed, with a median (IQR) of two (2-3) tests/patient. The overgrowth of wild-type virus at position 103 was observed in 14 subjects in group A (36%) and nine in group B (39%). No significant trend was found in relation to the disappearance of K103N variants in either group, but patients tested while receiving antiretrovirals had a significantly higher probability of retaining the K103N mutation over 24 months than those tested during treatment interruption (P = 0.007). In conclusion, following NNRTI discontinuation, HIV variants carrying the K103N mutation are not overgrown for long by wild-type quasispecies at this position in the majority of patients, although treatment interruption favours their disappearance. This suggests that the K103N mutation per se has little impact on viral fitness in vivo."
4899,0.005,5.0,"To investigate the process of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution in vivo, a total of 179 HIV-1 V3 sequences derived from cell-free plasma were determined from serial samples in three epidemiologically linked individuals (one infected blood donor and two transfusion recipients) over a maximum period of 8 years. A systematic analysis of pairwise comparisons of intrapatient sequences, both within and between each sample time point, revealed a preponderance and accumulation of nonsynonymous rather than synonymous substitutions in the V3 loop and flanking regions as they diverged over time. This strongly argues for the dominant role that positive selection for amino acid change plays in governing the pattern and process of HIV-1 env V3 evolution in vivo and nullifies hypotheses of purely neutral or mutation-driven evolution or completely chance events. In addition, different rates of evolution of HIV-1 were observed in these three different individuals infected with the same viral strain, suggesting that the degree of positive pressure for HIV-1 amino acid change is host dependent. Finally, the observed similar rate of accumulation in divergence within and between infected individuals suggests that the process of genetic divergence in the HIV epidemic proceeds regardless of host-to-host transmission events, i.e., that transmission does not reset the evolutionary clock."
8266,0.005,5.0,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important outcome measure among HIV-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), but has not been studied extensively in resource-limited settings. Insight in the predictors or correlates of poor HRQoL may be helpful to identify patients most in need of additional support and to design appropriate interventions. A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2012 and April 2013 in 10 healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Patients who were at least 6 months on cART were randomly selected and individual patient data were retrieved from medical records. HRQoL was measured by the WHOQoL-HIVBREF, depressive-symptoms by the Kessler-6 scale, and stigma by the Kalichman internalized AIDS-related stigma scale. Multivariate linear regression analysis was carried-out to examine associations between HRQoL and the other variables. A total of 664 patients (response-rate 95%) participated in the study. A higher level of depressive-symptoms was most strongly and consistently associated with a lower HRQoL, both in terms of the magnitude of the relationship and in the number of HRQoL domains associated with it. Also, a higher level of HIV-stigma was associated with a lower HRQoL except for the physical domain, while obtaining sufficient nutritious food and job opportunity were associated with a better HRQoL except for the spiritual and social domains, respectively. Demographics, clinical, and treatment characteristics yielded few significant associations with HRQoL. Our study findings suggest that interventions to improve HRQoL should focus on reducing depressive-symptoms and HIV-stigma, and on enhancing food security and job opportunity. "
3662,0.005,5.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can suppress HIV-1 replication and normalize the chronic immune activation associated with infection, but restoration of naïve CD4+ T cell populations is slow and usually incomplete for reasons that have yet to be determined. We tested the hypothesis that damage to the lymphoid tissue (LT) fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network contributes to naïve T cell loss in HIV-1 infection by restricting access to critical factors required for T cell survival. We show that collagen deposition and progressive loss of the FRC network in LTs prior to treatment restrict both access to and a major source of the survival factor interleukin-7 (IL-7). As a consequence, apoptosis within naïve T cell populations increases significantly, resulting in progressive depletion of both naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. We further show that the extent of loss of the FRC network and collagen deposition predict the extent of restoration of the naïve T cell population after 6 month of HAART, and that restoration of FRC networks correlates with the stage of disease at which the therapy is initiated. Because restoration of the FRC network and reconstitution of naïve T cell populations are only optimal when therapy is initiated in the early/acute stage of infection, our findings strongly suggest that HAART should be initiated as soon as possible. Moreover, our findings also point to the potential use of adjunctive anti-fibrotic therapies to avert or moderate the pathological consequences of LT fibrosis, thereby improving immune reconstitution."

3257,0.005,5.0,"Numerous host and viral factors likely participate in the onset and progression of HIV-1-associated dementia (HIVD). Previous studies have suggested that viral gene expression in resident central nervous system (CNS) cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage play a central role in the production of neurotoxic viral proteins and infectious virus, deregulation of cellular gene expression, and/or dysfunction of glial and neuronal cell populations. HIV-1 replication is regulated, in part, by interactions between cellular transcription factors and the viral trans-activators, Tat and viral protein R (Vpr), with cis-acting promoter elements within the LTR. We have previously demonstrated that Vpr binds with high affinity to selected sequence configurations within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and downstream sequences immediately adjacent to this site. Studies reported herein establish a correlation between the diagnosis of HIVD and the increased prevalence of HIV-1 LTRs containing a C/EBP binding site I that exhibits high affinity for Vpr. To this end, the interaction of Vpr with C/EBP site I variants in 47 LTRs from three nondemented patients and 96 LTRs from seven demented patients was examined. Competition electrophoretic mobility shift (EMS) analyses were utilized to examine Vpr binding to oligonucleotide probes containing C/EBP site I variants. We demonstrated that 89% of LTRs derived from patients exhibiting clinical dementia contained C/EBP site I configurations that displayed a high relative affinity for Vpr, while only 11% of LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that exhibited a low relative affinity Vpr binding phenotype. In contrast, examination of LTRs derived from patients lacking clinically evident dementia revealed that only 53% of brain-derived LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that displayed a high relative affinity for Vpr, while 47% of LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that exhibited a low relative affinity Vpr binding phenotype. We propose that sequence-specific interactions between cis-acting elements in the LTR, members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, and the virion-associated trans-activator protein Vpr play important roles in the pathogenesis of HIVD."
5502,0.005,5.0,"The contribution of bipolar disorder (BD), a prevalent serious mental illness characterized by impulsivity and mood instability, to antiretroviral (ART) and psychiatric medication adherence among HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals is unknown. We examined medication adherence among 44 HIV+/BD+ persons as compared to 33 demographically- and medically-comparable HIV+/BD- persons. Classification of adherent (≥ 90%) or non-adherent (<90%) based on proportion of correctly taken doses over 30 days was determined using electronic medication monitoring devices. HIV+/BD+ persons were significantly less likely to be ART adherent (47.7%) as compared to HIV+/BD- (90.9%) persons. Within the HIV+/BD+ group, mean psychiatric medication adherence was significantly worse than ART medication adherence, although there was a significant correlation between ART and psychiatric adherence levels. Importantly, 30-day ART adherence was associated with plasma virologic response among HIV+/BD+ individuals. Given the high overlap of HIV and BD, and the observed medication adherence difficulties for these persons, specialized adherence improvement interventions are needed."
4390,0.005,5.0,"Opportunistic infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are common complications of advanced immunodeficiency in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Neurological disease is the first manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 10% to 20% of symptomatic HIV-1 infection. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of such disorders is critical. Also, in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), these disease states have changed in presentation and epidemiology. Therefore, we review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of five common central nervous system disorders in individuals with HIV-1 infection: toxoplasma encephalitis, primary central nervous system lymphoma, cryptococcal meningitis, cytomegalovirus encephalitis, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."
694,0.005,5.0,"HIV-1 infection is characterized by loss of CD4T cells, leading to immunodeficiency. Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) results in suppression of the viral load and increased CD4 counts. Both viral and host factors determine CD4 cell responses to ART with approximately 15-30% of individuals having suboptimal increase of CD4T cell count, most commonly due to lack of compliance to ART. A smaller fraction of patients will have immune reconstitution failure and suboptimal CD4 increase despite suppression of HIV replication, and these individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. We sought to characterize the factors associated with decreased immunological response among Manitoba's HIV patient population. This retrospective case-control study included HIV patients with immune reconstitution failure despite suppression of HIV replication by ART. The immune reconstitution failure was defined by CD4 cell count increase from baseline of less than 100 CD4 cells/mm"
2034,0.005,5.0,"Due to their shared transmission route, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infections can be observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cases and are associated with more severe clinical courses. The detection of HBV DNA despite HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seronegativity is defined as occult HBV infections. According to the current seroepidemiological data, Turkey is classified as an intermediate HBV, low HIV endemic region. Occult HBV infections have previously been reported from Turkey but has not been investigated previously in HIV infected cohorts. The aim of this study was to identify occult HBV infections in HIV-infected persons. Twenty-eight HIV-positive cases followed-up at Hacettepe University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Unit were included in the study after informed consent. For the detection of HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HCV, commercial ELISA tests (Architect System, Abbott Diagnostics, USA) were employed. Absolute CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined via flow cytometry. HIV viral load was calculated via COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA) and the presence of HBV DNA was evaluated via COBAS TaqMan HBV Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA), in addition to a nested PCR assay targeting HBV S gene. The mean age of the study group was 43.2 (range between 27-65) years, 64.3% (18/28) of them were males and the mean duration of HIV infection was 4.2 (2-11) years. Mean CD4+ ve CD8+ T-cell counts were 414 ± 267 cells/mm3 and 854 ± 293 cells/mm3, respectively. Twenty-six (92.8%) cases were under highly-active anti-retroviral therapy at the time of the study, 88.5% of which included HBV-active drugs (lamivudine or tenofovir). HIV RNA were found negative in 11 (39.3%) patients, of those nine (81.8%) were the cases who treated with HBV-active antiretroviral therapy. HBsAg were negative in all of the 28 patients, while the positivity rates of anti-HBs and anti-HCV were 39.3% (11/28) and 3.6% (1/28), respectively. All samples were negative for HBV DNA via the commercial real-time PCR and in-house nested PCR assays. The absence of occult HBV in the study group may indicate the absence of occult HBV or suppression of viral replication due to the anti-retroviral therapy. In conclusion, further large-scale studies are required to fully understand the impact of occult HBV in HIV-infected patients in Turkey."

HBV DNA was particularly frequent in HIV-positive patients. Sequencing of the S gene showed that only two HIV-infected patients harboured mutants in the major hydrophilic loop; the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen detection could not be explained by diagnostic escape mutants.
4996,0.005,5.0,"Depression is associated with poor antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS. This relationship may be moderated by an individual's social network characteristics. Our study sought to examine social network correlates of treatment adherence among HIV-positive men recruited from social service agencies throughout Los Angeles County (N = 150) to inform technology-driven social support interventions for this population. We administered egocentric social network and computer-assisted survey interviews focused on demographic characteristics, health history, depressive symptoms, and ART adherence, where adherence was assessed by the number of reasons participants missed taking their medication, if ever. Significant univariate correlates of adherence were included in a multivariable regression analysis, where the moderating effect of having a network member who reminds participants to take their HIV medication on the relationship between depression and adherence was tested. Over 60% of participants reported clinically significant depressive symptoms; this was significantly associated with lower adherence among those without someone in their social network to remind them about taking their HIV medication, even after adjusting for covariates in an ordinary least squares regression (adjusted mean difference b = -1.61, SE = 0.42, p = 0.0003). Having a network member who reminds participants to take their ART medication significantly ameliorated the negative association between depression and treatment adherence, especially for those reporting greater depressive symptoms (p = 0.0394). Additionally, participants demonstrated high rates of technology use to communicate with social network members. In order to achieve the aims of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, innovative interventions addressing mental health to improve ART adherence are needed. Network strategies that leverage technology may be helpful for improving ART adherence among HIV-positive men with comorbid depressive symptoms."
6532,0.005,5.0,"This study describes the social networks of secondary school students in Moshi Municipality, and their association with self-rated risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 300 students aged 15-24 years in 5 secondary schools in Moshi, Tanzania. Bonding networks were defined as social groupings of students participating in activities within the school, while bridging networks were groups that included students participating in social groupings from outside of the school environs. A structured questionnaire was used to ask about participation in bonding and bridging social networks and self-rated HIV risk behavior. More participants participated in bonding networks (72%) than in bridging networks (29%). Participation in bridging networks was greater among females (25%) than males (12%, p<.005). Of 300 participants, 88 (29%) were sexually experienced, and of these 62 (70%) considered themselves to be at low risk of HIV infection. Factors associated with self-rated risk of HIV included: type of school (p<.003), family structure (p<.008), being sexually experienced (p<.004), having had sex in the past three months (p<.009), having an extra sexual partner (p<.054) and non-condom use in last sexual intercourse (p<.001), but not the presence or type of social capital. The study found no association between bonding and bridging social networks on self-rated risk of HIV among study participants. However, sexually experienced participants rated themselves at low risk of HIV infection despite practicing unsafe sex. Efforts to raise adolescents' self-awareness of risk of HIV infection through life skills education and HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome risk reduction strategies may be beneficial to students in this at-risk group."
5606,0.005,5.0,"Molecular clones of HIV-1 were obtained from isolates cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and directly from uncultured PBMCs from a laboratory worker accidentally infected with the HIV-1 laboratory strain, HIV-1(HTLV-IIIB). Envelope sequences corresponding to the first 752 amino acids of HIV-1(HTLV-IIIB) clone BH10 were obtained from clones of cultured virus and sequenced. Three env clones obtained shortly after infection differed among themselves at only seven nucleotide positions, resulting in one amino acid substitution and one frameshift mutation. These envelope sequences were as similar to the envelope sequences of various IIIB clones as the latter were to each other. env divergence increased over the course of infection. However, the overall diversity in env clones obtained two or more years after infection was still comparable to that among IIIB env clones from the original IIIB culture. Multiple clones of partial env gene sequences containing the V3 loop were also obtained directly from uncultured PBMCs by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The env sequences of these clones were generally similar to those of the cultured viruses. Within the V3 region, the earliest isolates retained the sequence of the HXB2 clone from IIIB. Clones obtained later showed a progressive divergence in V3. An A-to-T substitution within the GPGRAF sequence at the tip of the V3 loop was observed within 1 year after infection, and this mutation predominated in all subsequent isolates. Antibodies against the V3 loops of IIIB and divergent 1987 and 1990 LW isolates appeared simultaneously in laboratory worker serum and persisted with no significant differences in titer. Furthermore, neutralization studies with autologous sequential sera suggested selection for the A-to-T change in V3 was not due to V3-directed antibodies. These results demonstrate a surprising homogeneity among env sequences of HIV-1 from an infected laboratory worker, perhaps because the initial infection originated from a relatively homogeneous population of tissue culture-adapted virus."
8801,0.005,5.0,"The host genetic compound plays a vital role in determining clinical outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor family member-associated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activator (TANK) takes part in the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway and the interferon (IFN)-induction pathways that have relevance to HBV-related liver disease. In this report, we explored whether the intronic polymorphism rs3820998 of the TANK gene was associated with outcomes of HBV infection by binary logistic regression analysis. A total of 1305 unrelated Han Chinese patients recruited from Wuhan, including 180 acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACLF-HBV) patients, 331 HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, 308 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and 486 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsC) were genotyped using the TaqMan probe method. Logistic analysis revealed that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3820998 was significantly associated with susceptibility to ACLF-HBV (dominant model, OR 0.643, 95% CI 0.428,0.964, p=0.033; additive model, OR 0.640, 95% CI 0.414,0.990, p=0.045), and LC (recessive model, OR 0.398, 95% CI 0.164,0.966, p=0.042; additive model, OR 0.379, 95% CI 0.155,0.928, p=0.034). These results indicate that the G > T variant is a protective factor in the development of ACLF-HBV and LC, and that the SNP rs3820998 in the TANK gene may play a role in mediating susceptibility to ACLF-HBV and LC in a Chinese Han population."
2498,0.005,5.0,"The spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has gradually decreased in Italy in the last 5 decades as shown by the steady reduction in the incidence rates of acute hepatitis B, from 10/100000 inhabitants in 1984 to 0.85/100000 in 2012, and by the reduced prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive cases among chronic hepatitis patients with different etiologies, from 60% in 1975 to about 10% in 2001. The prevalence of HBsAg chronic carriers in the general population also decreased from nearly 3% in the 1980s to 1% in 2010. Linked to HBV by its characteristics of defective virus, the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) has shown a similar epidemiological impact on the Italian population over time. The incidence of acute HDV infection decreased from 3.2/100000 inhabitants in 1987 to 0.8/100000 in 2010 and the prevalence of HDV infection in HBsAg chronic carriers decreased from 24% in 1990 to 8.5% in 2006. Before the beneficial effects of HBV mass vaccination introduced in 1991, the decreased endemicity of HBV and HDV infection in Italy paralleled the improvement in screening blood donations, the higher standard of living and impressive reduction in the birth rate associated with a marked reduction in the family size. A further contribution to the decline in HBV and HDV infections most probably came from the media campaigns to prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus infection by focusing the attention of the general population on the same routes of transmission of viral infections such as unsafe sexual intercourse and parenteral exposures of different kinds.

3494,0.005,5.0,"During the period May 1987 to November 1989, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers was determined by ELISA in serum samples of 7405 (55% male, 45% female) apparently healthy persons 3-19 years of age in Italy. Earlier studies of adults there had shown an intermediate degree of HBV endemicity (hepatitis B surface antigen carrier rate greater than 2%). Persons were selected by systematic cluster sampling in five different geographical areas of Italy. The overall prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was 0.6%. The overall prevalence of at least one marker of HBV was 2.8%; it increased from 1.7% among children 3-5 years of age to 4.5% in teenagers 17-19 years of age (P less than 0.001). The prevalence of any HBV marker was higher in southern then in northern areas (3.5% vs. 1.8%, P less than 0.001). A significant association was found with sociodemographic features. Persons whose fathers had less than 6 years of schooling had a 2.3-fold risk (C.I. 95% = 1.5-3.4) while those belonging to a household of six or more under one roof had a 1.7-fold risk (C.I. 95% = 1.2-2.4) of previous exposure to HBV infection. These findings indicate that, today in Italy, exposure to HBV infection at a young age is very low and suggest a shift towards a low degree of endemicity following improvements in socio-economic conditions, decreased family size and increasing use of disposable syringes during recent years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
9196,0.005,5.0,"Because of the increasing availability of antiretroviral (ARV) agents for HIV in low-income countries, many clinicians now need training on their use. This is especially true for clinicians caring for individuals with tuberculosis (TB), given its close relationship with HIV/AIDS. This article summarizes the key decisions facing clinicians who manage HIV-infected persons, with particular reference to issues regarding those dually infected with TB. Health care provider-initiated diagnostic testing using rapid HIV tests should be offered to all individuals with symptoms and signs suggesting HIV infection, including all persons with TB. Issues to be included in pre- and post-test counseling sessions are discussed. HIV-infected patients should be evaluated to determine clinical staging of HIV; certain laboratory examinations should ideally be performed to assess the degree of immunosuppression and to aid decisions about when best to start ARV therapy and preventive therapies. The recommended ARV regimens and guidance on proposed patient follow-up are presented. Good adherence to ARVs is required and factors that induce and reinforce compliance are suggested. The treatment of TB is a high priority, and follows the same principles whether the patient is HIV-infected or not. Suggestions are made about ARV use in patients with TB. A standardized and complementary information system should be developed to monitor management of HIV-TB patients and performance of joint TB and HIV care efforts. By diagnosing and managing additional HIV cases detected through the portal of the TB control programme, clinicians will contribute to diminishing the burden of HIV, and thus, TB."

There are conflicting data on the effect of HCV on the risk of HIV progression and CD4 response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Long-term prospective cohort studies are clearly required to resolve these issues. The optimal management of the co-infected patient is also unclear. For the co-infected patient, the optimal HAART regimen for best immune CD4 recovery and least adverse reactions remains unclear. Unfortunately, current HCV treatment is associated with significant side effects and a considerable proportion of HIV co-infected patients are poor candidates for HCV treatment. Better and more effective treatment for HCV (preferably not based on interferon) is urgently required for this group of patients. Patients with good CD4 cell count and with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 are likely to have a reasonable response to treatment."

2578,0.005,5.0,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis prompted the reintroduction of para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) to protect companion anti-tuberculosis drugs from additional acquired resistance. In sub-Saharan Africa, MDR/XDR tuberculosis with HIV coinfection is common, and concurrent treatment of HIV infection and MDR/XDR tuberculosis is required. Out of necessity, patients receive multiple drugs, and PAS therapy is frequent; however, neither potential drug interactions nor the effects of HIV infection are known. Potential drug-drug interaction with PAS and the effect of HIV infection was examined in 73 pulmonary tuberculosis patients; 22 (30.1%) were HIV coinfected. Forty-one pulmonary MDR or XDR tuberculosis patients received 4 g PAS twice daily, and in a second crossover study, another 32 patients were randomized, receiving 4 g PAS twice daily or 8 g PAS once daily. A PAS population pharmacokinetic model in two dosing regimens was developed; potential covariates affecting its pharmacokinetics were examined, and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted evaluating the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic index. The probability of target attainment (PTA) to maintain PAS levels above MIC during the dosing interval was estimated by simulation of once-, twice-, and thrice-daily dosing regimens not exceeding 12 g daily. Concurrent efavirenz (EFV) medication resulted in a 52% increase in PAS clearance and a corresponding >30% reduction in mean PAS area under the concentration curve in 19 of 22 HIV-M. tuberculosis-coinfected patients. Current practice recommends maintenance of PAS concentrations at ≥1 μg/ml (the MIC of M. tuberculosis), but the model predicts that at only a minimum dose of 4 g twice daily can this PTA be achieved in at least 90% of the population, whether or not EFV is concomitantly administered. Once-daily dosing of 12 g PAS will not provide PAS concentrations exceeding the MIC over the entire dosing interval if coadministered with EFV, while 4 g twice daily ensures concentrations exceeding MIC over the entire dosing interval, even in HIV-infected patients who received EFV.

1303,0.005,5.0,"Health literacy is known to influence medication adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS. People who experience difficulty reading health information may benefit from asking others to assist them with reading, interpreting, and understanding medical information. We examined medical chart-abstracted HIV viral load, medication adherence assessed by unannounced pill counts, and adherence improvement strategies among 245 individuals with lower-health literacy who do not request assistance, and 229 who do request assistance with reading and understanding health information. Participants were people living with HIV who were taking antiretroviral therapy and scored below 90% correct on a standardized test of functional health literacy. After controlling for health literacy scores, requesting informational assistance was associated with strategies used to improve adherence; individuals who asked for assistance were significantly more likely to use multiple adherence strategies. However, despite requesting informational assistance and using more adherence strategies, participants who requested informational assistance evidenced poorer treatment adherence and poorer suppression of HIV replication. Requesting assistance was more common among those with the poorest health literacy and therefore greatest challenges to adherence. People living with HIV who have poor health literacy skills may benefit from medication adherence programs and requests for assistance afford opportunities for social interventions."

Causes (including HIV symptoms, quality of life, depression, herbal treatment and alcohol use) for discontinuing ART follow-up in predominantly rural resource-limited settings are not well understood. This is a prospective study of the treatment-naïve patients recruited from three (one urban, one-semi-urban and one rural) public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal from October 2007 to February 2008. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of loss to follow-up or all caused attrition from an ART programme within a cohort followed up for over 12 months. A total of 735 patients (217 men and 518 women) prior to initiating ART completed a baseline questionnaire and 6- and 12-months' follow-up. At 12-months follow-up 557 (75.9%) individuals continued active ART, 177 (24.1%) were all cause attrition, there were 82 deaths (13.8%), 58 (7.9%) transfers, 7 (1.0%) refused participation, 8 (1.1%) were not yet on ART and 22 (3.0%) could not be traced. Death by 12-months of follow-up was associated with lower CD4 cell counts (risk ratio, RR=2.05, confidence intervals, CI=1.20-3.49) and higher depression levels (RR=1.05, CI=1.01-1.09) at baseline assessment. The high early mortality rates indicate that patients are enrolling into ART programmes with far too advanced immunodeficiency; median CD4 cell counts 119 (IQR=59-163). Causes of late access to the ART programme, such as delays in health care access (delayed health care seeking), health system delays, or inappropriate treatment criteria, need to be addressed. Differences in health status (lower CD4 cell counts and higher depression scores) should be taken into account when initiating patients on ART. Treating depression at ART initiation is recommended to improve treatment outcome."

Two groups were evaluated: those who had achieved HIV-RNA suppression (HIV-RNA <500 copies/mL, group 1, n=21) and those who had achieved incomplete HIV-RNA suppression (HIV-RNA>500 copies/mL, group 2, n=14) at the time of study entry. NFV one-hour pre-dose concentrations were significantly higher in group 1 compared to group 2 (P=0.023). The NFV AUC(0.5-4) for group 1 approached significance (P=0.068). No significant differences in IDV concentrations or AUC(0.5-4) were found between group 1 and group 2. It is feasible to use PI drug level monitoring in the outpatient setting."

Through ethnographic research in São Paulo from 1999 to 2001, the life trajectories of 50 children ages 1-15 living with or affected by HIV were studied. Data were collected via participant observation and semi-structured informal interviews and analyzed using social theories on illness experience and social inequality. Our results demonstrate that AIDS-related stigma occurs within complex discrimination processes that change as children reach adolescence. We found that structural violence in the forms of poverty, racism, and inequalities in social status, gender, and age fuels children's experiences of stigma. We also describe how access to HAART changes the lived experience of children, reduces stigma, and brings new challenges in AIDS care such as adolescents' sexuality and treatment adherence. Based on these results, we propose structural violence as the framework to study stigma and argue that interventions to reduce stigma that solely target the perception and attitudes toward people living with HIV are limited. In contrast universal access to HAART in Brazil is a powerful intervention that reduces stigma, in that it transforms AIDS from a debilitating and fatal disease to a chronic and manageable one, belongs to a broader mechanism to assure citizens' rights, and reduces social inequalities in access to health care."

Peripheral blood iNKT cells from HIV-1+ and TB patients had significantly increased expression of CD69, CD38, HLA-DR, CD16, CD56, and CD62L. The expression of CD25 was significantly increased only on iNKT cells from TB patients.

9509,0.005,5.0,"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a potent trans-activator of transcription from the viral LTR promoter. Previous mutagenesis studies have identified domains within Tat responsible for binding to its TAR RNA target and for transcriptional activation. The minimal Tat activation domain is composed of the N-terminal 48 residues, and mutational analyses identified a cluster of critical cysteines. The importance of four highly conserved aromatic amino acids within the activation domain has not been thoroughly investigated. We have systematically substituted these aromatic residues (Y26, F32, F38, Y47) of the HIV-1 LAI Tat protein with other aromatic residues (conservative mutation) or alanine (nonconservative mutation). The activity of the mutant Tat constructs was measured in different cell lines by transfection with a LTR-CAT reporter plasmid. The range of transcriptional activities measured for this set of Tat mutants allowed careful assessment of the level of Tat activity required for optimal viral replication. To test this, the mutant Tat genes were introduced into the pLAI infectious molecular clone and tested for their effect on virus replication in a T-cell line. We found that a twofold reduction in Tat activity already affects viral replication, and no virus replication was measured for Tat mutants with less than 15% activity. This strict correlation between Tat activity and viral replication demonstrates the importance of the Tat function to viral fitness. Interestingly, a less pronounced replication defect was observed in primary cell types. This finding may correlate with the frequent detection of proviruses with Tat-inactivating mutations in clinical samples."

We assessed whether carriage of the TNF-α gene promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with lipodystrophy and metabolic derangements in HIV-1-infected patients treated with cART. We also assessed variations in TNF-α receptor plasma levels. The study group comprised 286 HIV-1-infected patients (133 with and 153 without lipodystrophy) and 203 uninfected controls (UC). TNF-α -238G > A, -308G > A, and -863 C > A SNP were assessed using PCR-RFLPs on white cell DNA. Plasma sTNF-α R1 and R2 levels were measured by ELISA. Student's t test, the χ(2) test, Pearson correlations, and the logistic regression test were performed for statistical analysis. The TNF-α -308G > A SNP was significantly associated with lipodystrophy in the univariate analysis (p = 0.04). This association, however, was no longer significant in the multivariate analysis. A meta-analysis of the published literature and our own data, which included 284 patients with lipodystrophy and 338 without lipodystrophy, showed that there was no relationship between the TNF-α -238G > A and -308G > A SNP and lipodystrophy (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). HIV-1-infected patients had greater sTNF-α R2 plasma levels than UC (p = 0.001) whereas sTNF-α R1 and R2 levels were not significantly different in both the HIV-1-infected cohorts, lipodystrophy vs. nonlipodystrophy (p = NS). In our cohort of white Spaniards the TNF-α -238G > A, -308G > A, and -863C > A SNP were not associated with lipodystrophy in HIV-1-infected patients treated with cART. This finding was replicated in a meta-analysis of the published data, which showed no associations between the TNF-α -238G > A and -308G > A SNP and lipodystrophy. In HIV-1-infected patients under cART there is a systemic overproduction of sTNF-α R2, which is unrelated to the presence of lipodystrophy."
5915,0.005,5.0,"We describe preliminary molecular characterization of HIV-1 pol from 108 consecutive HIV seropositive users of a Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) site of Porto Alegre city, the major metropolitan area in the south of Brazil. Protease and partial reverse transcriptase regions were retrotranscribed from plasma HIV-1 RNA and sequenced after direct nested PCR. Principal antiretroviral resistance mutations (ARM) were observed in 3% of the samples, two cases with K103N and one with M41L, L210W and T215Y, all in HIV-1 clade B infected men. At protease region, no principal mutations were observed, but polymorphisms at secondary codons were frequent. Contrary to other areas in the country where clade B dominates, HIV-1 clade C genomes predominated in this study (58%), clade B (32%) and clade F1 (3%). Of the genomes clustering in clade C, almost half (43%) had a small clade B segment at reverse transcriptase, forming a sub-cluster within clade C with a similar recombinant structure and carrying new amino acid signatures. Other mosaic genomes were also observed (7%). The low prevalence of resistance mutations is consistent with previous observations at this geographical location but the high frequency of HIV-1 clade C and CB mosaics seems pre-eminent and warns close monitoring."
1096,0.005,5.0,"U.S. AIDS rates have declined among same population groups; however, African-Americans and other ethnic minorities have experienced the least amount of decline. As a result medical and public health authorities are tasked with developing strategies to help eliminate the disparity in HIV/AIDS incidence rate and clinical outcomes. Thus, in 1999, the National Minority AIDS Education and Training Center (NMAETC) was developed to facilitate training, clinical consultation and technical assistance to clinicians that provide care to HIV-infected minority patients. Its initial activities were designed solely to increase providers' clinical capacity to use state-of-art anti-retroviral therapies to treat and manage the disease. However, through focused discussions with target providers and a survey of medical care service sites, the NMAETC confirms that provider' training and assistance needs extend into non-medical domains."
5653,0.004,4.0,"The reasons for the viral persistence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are unknown, but are probably related to host immune factors. Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can regulate an inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MMP-3 and -9 genes on the susceptibility to persistent HBV infection. We studied 489 Korean patients with HBV infection (144 inactive carriers, 182 chronic hepatitis, and 163 liver cirrhosis) and 174 healthy individuals who had recovered from HBV infection. MMP-3 gene SNPs were identified at two polymorphic sites (codon 45 [E45K] and codon 96 [D96D]) and MMP-9 gene SNPs at three polymorphic sites (codon 279 [R279Q], codon 607 [G607G], and codon 668 [Q668R]) in study subjects. The frequency of T allele at third position of codon 96 in the MMP-3 gene was higher in HBV persistence patients when analyzed by co-dominant model (age- and sex-adjusted OR=1.242, 95% CI= 1.001-1.540, p=0.049). In conclusion the T allele at the third position of codon 96 in the MMP-3 gene might be associated with persistent HBV infection."

991,0.004,4.0,"Both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 seroconversions have been considered as outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of needle exchange programs. To assess the relationships between incident HBV and HIV infections among injecting drug users (IDUs), seroconversions were prospectively studied among a cohort of 240 HBV- and HIV- seronegative IDUs. The incidence of HBV seroconversion declined from 24.41/100 person-years in 1988 to 0 seroconversions in 1992. In contrast, HIV seroconversion rates varied little from the overall rate of 3.29/100 person-years. HBV seroconversion predicted subsequent HIV seroconversion among male IDUs (relative incidence [RI]= 4.23) but not among female IDUs (RI=0.86). Because of different transmission dynamics, HBV seroconversion probably has limited utility as a surrogate outcome measure for incident HIV. However, HBV seroconversion itself is an appropriate and important outcome measure for evaluation of prevention programs among IDUs."
455,0.004,4.0,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and shows a propensity to metastasize and infiltrate adjacent and more distant tissues. HCC is associated with multiple risk factors, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which is especially prevalent in China. Here, we used exome sequencing to identify somatic mutations in ten HBV-positive individuals with HCC with portal vein tumor thromboses (PVTTs), intrahepatic metastases. Both C:G>A:T and T:A>A:T transversions were frequently found among the 331 non-silent mutations. Notably, ARID1A, which encodes a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, was mutated in 14 of 110 (13%) HBV-associated HCC specimens. We used RNA interference to assess the roles of 91 of the confirmed mutated genes in cellular survival. The results suggest that seven of these genes, including VCAM1 and CDK14, may confer growth and infiltration capacity to HCC cells. This study provides a view of the landscape of somatic mutations that may be implicated in advanced HCC."
8664,0.004,4.0,"Since some hepatitis viruses and the human immunodeficiency viruses share common modes of transmission, such as the sexual route, we undertook to investigate the prevalence of antibodies to these and other pathogens among 384 rural pregnant women. Our study was intended to form the basis of infection management policies in pregnancy. Antibodies and other markers of the hepatitis A, B, C, and D viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV), the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Treponema pallidum were sought. We tested for antibodies to the viruses using the appropriate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. HCV and HIV-1 infection were confirmed using standard immunoblotting techniques. Regarding HBV, we tested for the surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to the surface antigen (anti-HBs) and antibody to the core antigen (anti-HBc). A non-specific test, the rapid plasma reagin test (RPR), was used for estimating Treponema pallidum (syphilis) infection. We found an overall prevalence of antibodies to HAV of 91.4%, to HCV of 6.8%, to HDV of 0%, and to HIV-1 of 3.5%. We found no IgM antibodies to HAV. The incidence of HBV markers was as follows: 5.4% for HBsAg, 61.3% for anti-HBs, and 84.6% for anti-HBc. RPR reactivity was found in 15.8% of the women. These results will be used to establish appropriate management and preventative policies for women attending the antenatal clinic. Prevention and appropriate early treatment of infections in these women will be considered."
5168,0.004,4.0,"The present study examined the comparative efficacy of intervening at the caregiver/care-recipient dyadic level, versus the individual caregiver level, for caregivers and their care-recipients with HIV/AIDS. Participants were randomly assigned to a Dyad Intervention (DI), a Caregiver Intervention (CI) or Wait List Control group (WLC), and assessed by interview and self-administered scales immediately before treatment and eight weeks later. Participants in the intervention groups also completed a four-month follow-up assessment. Dependent variables included global distress, social adjustment, dyadic adjustment, subjective health status, HIV/AIDS knowledge and target problem ratings. Results showed that caregivers in the DI group showed greater improvement from pre- to post-treatment on global distress, dyadic adjustment and target problems than the CI and WLC caregivers. The CI and DI caregivers showed greater improvement than the WLC group on all dependent variables except social adjustment. Care-recipients in the DI group improved significantly from pre- to post-treatment on dyadic adjustment, social adjustment, knowledge, subjective health status and Target Problem 1, whereas the CI and WLC care-recipients failed to improve on any of these measures. The treatment gains made by the DI caregivers and care-recipients on most dependent variables were maintained at a four-month follow-up. Findings support a reciprocal determinism approach to the process of dyadic adjustment and suggest that intervening at the caregiver/care-recipient level may produce better outcomes for both the caregiver and care-recipient than intervening at the individual caregiver level."
1237,0.004,4.0,"African green monkeys (AGMs) are naturally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) at high prevalence levels and do not progress to AIDS. Sexual transmission is the main transmission route in AGM, while mother-to-infant transmission (MTIT) is negligible. We investigated SIV transmission in wild AGMs to assess whether or not high SIV prevalence is due to differences in mucosal permissivity to SIV (i.e., whether the genetic bottleneck of viral transmission reported in humans and macaques is also observed in AGMs in the wild). We tested 121 sabaeus AGMs (Chlorocebus sabaeus) from the Gambia and found that 53 were SIV infected (44%). By combining serology and viral load quantitation, we identified 4 acutely infected AGMs, in which we assessed the diversity of the quasispecies by single-genome amplification (SGA) and documented that a single virus variant established the infections. We thus show that natural SIV transmission in the wild is associated with a genetic bottleneck similar to that described for mucosal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission in humans. Flow cytometry assessment of the immune cell populations did not identify major differences between infected and uninfected AGM. The expression of the SIV coreceptor CCR5 on CD4+ T cells dramatically increased in adults, being higher in infected than in uninfected infant and juvenile AGMs. Thus, the limited SIV MTIT in natural hosts appears to be due to low target cell availability in newborns and infants, which supports HIV MTIT prevention strategies aimed at limiting the target cells at mucosal sites. Combined, (i) the extremely high prevalence in sexually active AGMs, (ii) the very efficient SIV transmission in the wild, and (iii) the existence of a fraction of multiparous females that remain uninfected in spite of massive exposure to SIV identify wild AGMs as an acceptable model of exposed, uninfected individuals."
204,0.004,4.0,Clinical trials were conducted to assess the feasibility of using a cell phone text messaging-based system to follow up Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected patients on antiretroviral (ARTs) and assess for improved adherence to their medication. However there is need to evaluate the perceptions of the HIV infected patients towards the use of these cell phones in an effort to better aid in the clinical management of their HIV infection. The objective of this study was therefore to determine the perceptions of HIV infected patients on the use of cell phone text messaging as a tool to support adherence to their ART medication.
3379,0.004,4.0,"Antiretroviral treatment nonadherence is complex, implicating more than a patient's ability and motivation to be compliant. The bulk of the research to date focuses on individual level barriers with less emphasis on the many system level factors that potentially impact patients' adherence behaviors. This study examined the effects of system enabling factors in addition to the frequently studied individual predisposing and enabling factors upon nonadherence to treatment. One hundred eighty-two patients from five community-based clinics were interviewed and their medical charts examined. Patients' self-reported nonadherence was correlated with clinicians' assessments of medication and appointment nonadherence. Seven individual predisposing factors (gender, ethnicity, birthplace, years of education, HIV Overview of Problems-Evaluation System [HOPES] psychosocial, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] anxiety, and HADS depression scores) were found to be significantly associated with treatment adherence/nonadherence. Individual enabling factors (hopefulness and access to health care), as well as treatment by clinic staff, a system enabling factor, were significantly associated with adherence/nonadherence. In a multivariate analysis, six factors - age (younger), gender (female), birth outside the United States, level of hopefulness (lower), access to health care (lower), and treatment by clinic staff (poorer) - accounted for 19.3% of the variance in nonadherence. Results of this study indicated that several individual predisposing and enabling factors were potential predictors of treatment nonadherence; however, system enabling factors, e.g., treatment by clinic staff were also associated with treatment nonadherence. Further studies are needed to examine the complex relationships of individual and system related factors in predicting treatment nonadherence."
8329,0.004,4.0,"The duration of HIV infection is usually unknown for most patients entering into HIV care. Data on the frequency at which resistance mutations are detected in these patients are needed to support practical guidance on the use of resistance testing in this clinical situation. Furthermore, little is known about HIV subtype diversity in much of the United States. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence of drug resistance mutations and nonsubtype B strains of HIV among antiretroviral-naïve individuals presenting for HIV care in New York State between September 2000 and January 2004. Sequences were obtained using a commercial HIV genotyping assay. Seventeen of 151 subjects (11.3%; 95% confidence interval 7.2%-17.3%) had at least one drug-resistance mutation, including 5 subjects with fewer than 200 CD4(+) T cells, indicative of advanced infection. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor resistance mutations were detected in 6.6%, 5.3%, and 0.7% of subjects, respectively. Subjects from New York City-based clinics were less likely to have resistant virus than subjects from clinics elsewhere in New York State. Nonsubtype B strains of HIV were detected in 9 (6.0%) individuals and were associated with heterosexual contact. Two nonsubtype B strains from this cohort also carried drug-resistance mutations. These data indicate that drug-resistant virus is frequently detected in antiretroviral-naïve individuals entering HIV care in New York State. Furthermore, a diverse set of nonsubtype B strains were identified and evidence suggests that nonsubtype B strains, including those carrying drug-resistance mutations, are being transmitted in New York State."
1457,0.004,4.0,"Measures of sexual health were assessed during 2008-2009 in a New York City sample of 102 injection and noninjection users of heroin, cocaine, or crack. There was considerable overlap and transitioning between crack smoking and injecting. Crack users were also significantly more likely to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual than other drug users. In multivariate analysis, HIV infection was independently associated with crack use and with being gay or bisexual. In New York City, HIV prevention for drug users has focused on syringe access, safe injection, and drug user treatment, but further progress in HIV control will require strategies to address sexual health among people who use drugs. The study's limitations are noted."

3610,0.004,4.0,"Recent findings suggest bidirectional antagonisms between the K65R mutation and thymidine analogue mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected, treatment-experienced patients, yet little is known about HIV-2 in this regard. This study addressed the effects of innate polymorphisms in HIV-2 on emergent resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. Emergent drug resistance profiles in HIV-2 subtypes A (n = 3) and B (n = 1) were compared to those of HIV-1 subtypes B and C. Drug resistance was evaluated with cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and MT2 cells, using selective pressure with tenofovir (TFV), zidovudine (ZDV), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), abacavir (ABC), lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine (FTC), or various dual-drug combinations. Resistance was evaluated using conventional and ultrasensitive sequencing approaches. In agreement with our previous findings, dual-drug combinations of TFV, ddI, ABC, d4T, ZDV, and 3TC preferentially selected for K65R in HIV-1 subtype C isolates. In HIV-1 subtype B, TFV-3TC and ZDV-3TC selected for M184I and D67N, respectively. In contrast, selections with all four HIV-2 cultures favored the development of M184I in dual-drug combinations that included either 3TC or FTC. Since HIV-2 cultures did not develop K65R, an ultrasensitive allele-specific real-time PCR assay was developed to distinguish the presence of 65R from wild-type K65 after 16 cycles with a discriminatory ability of 0.1% against a population of wild-type virus. These results underscore potential differences in emergent drug resistance pathways in HIV-1 and HIV-2 and show that polymorphisms may influence the development of the resistance pathways that are likely to emerge."
7335,0.004,4.0,"We report a large monocentric case series of 82 patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). No germline mutations of the PPH1 gene (bone morphogenetic protein receptor-II) were found in any of the 19 patients tested. PAH was the direct cause of death in 72% of cases. Survival rates of the overall population at 1, 2, and 3 years were 73, 60, and 47%, respectively. Survival was significantly poorer in patients in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV at the time of diagnosis, as compared with those in functional class I-II with respective rates of 60, 45, and 28% versus 100, 90, 84% at 1, 2, and 3 years (p < 0.0001). Subsequently, we analyzed prognostic factors in patients in functional class III-IV. Univariate analysis indicated that CD4 lymphocyte count of more than 212 cells mm(-3), the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), and epoprostenol infusion were related with a better survival. On multivariate analysis only CD4 lymphocyte count was an independent predictor of survival, presumably because CART and epoprostenol infusion were strongly linked in our patient population. These results suggest that patients with severe human immunodeficiency virus-associated PAH should be considered for long-term epoprostenol infusion in association with CART."

Two HIV-1(LAI) RT regions encompassing mutation M41L, L74V, M184V, and T215Y/F were recognized in 75 and 83% mutated and in 33 and 42% unmutated samples, respectively. A total of 41 new CTL epitopes overlapping these mutations were predicted. Mutations enhanced HLA-binding scores of 17 epitopes, decreased scores of 5, and had no effect in 19. Four predicted epitopes containing mutations 41, 74, and 184 were tested and recognized by CD8 cells from mutated or unmutated samples, with frequencies up to 270 gamma interferon spot-forming cells per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Therefore, RT mutations induced by NRTI can increase the immunogenicity of RT for CTL and might allow a better immune control of resistant viruses in vivo, suggesting that specific immune therapy might help prevent these mutations."

5618,0.004,4.0,"Monocyte activation during HIV-1 infection is associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory markers and increased risk for premature development of age-related diseases. Because activated monocytes primarily use glucose to support cellular metabolism, we hypothesized that chronic monocyte activation during HIV-1 infection induces a hypermetabolic response with increased glucose uptake. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) expression and glucose uptake by monocyte subpopulations in HIV-seropositive (HIV(+)) treatment-naive individuals (n = 17), HIV(+) individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy with viral loads below detection (n = 11), and HIV-seronegative (HIV(-)) individuals (n = 16). Surface expression of Glut1 and cellular uptake of the fluorescent glucose analog 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl) amino)-2 deoxyglucose were analyzed by flow cytometry on monocyte subpopulations. Irrespective of treatment status, monocytes from HIV(+) persons had significantly increased surface expression of Glut1 compared with those from HIV(-) controls. Nonclassical (CD14(+)CD16(++)) and intermediate (CD14(++)CD16(+)) monocyte subpopulations showed higher Glut1 expression than did classical (CD14(++)CD16(-)) monocytes. Intermediate monocytes from treatment-naive HIV(+) individuals also showed increased uptake of 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl) amino)-2 deoxyglucose compared with those from HIV(-) controls. Our results show that HIV infection is associated with increased glucose metabolism in monocytes and that Glut1 expression by proinflammatory monocytes is a potential marker of inflammation in HIV-infected subjects. However, the possibility exists whereby other Gluts such as Glut3 and Glut4 may also support the influx of glucose into activated and inflammatory monocyte populations. "
3760,0.004,4.0,"Liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease is complicated by HBV recurrence and, consequently, poor patient and graft survival. Patients transplanted for hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-related cirrhosis are reported to have a diminished incidence of HBV recurrence and improved graft survival. However, only a few reported HDV-infected patients had active HBV replicative disease before liver transplantation. In our experience, we transplanted two HDV-infected patients, both of whom had active HBV replication before liver transplantation. In one patient, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) recurred four months after transplantation. Two months later, Hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) and HBV-DNA became positive, and the patient died of fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. In the other patient, HBV persisted after transplantation, and 2 months later the patient required retransplantation for fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. With the second graft, the patient remained free of HBV infection for 1 year. Thereafter, the patient experienced HBV recurrence with active replication and died of fulminant hepatitis B and delta recurrence. In the first case and in the second graft of the second case, hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) immunoprophylaxis was administered in an attempt to prevent recurrence of HBV. The literature suggests that an HDV infection inhibits the replication of HBV and therefore plays a role in preventing the recurrence of HBV and improving survival. Our experience with two patients suggests that HDV infection, in the presence of active HBV replication, may not play a protective role."
6449,0.004,4.0,"Epidemiological data on hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in Belgium are lacking. A multicenter questionnaire-based registry on HDV infection was collated between March 1, 2008 and February 28, 2009. It consisted of patients coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV. The data samples were compared to those of a concurrent registry on HBV infection. Prospective data of patients with HBV-HDV coinfection were collected. Active HBV replication is defined as HBeAg positivity or HBV DNA > 2,000 IU/ml. Forty-four patients from 15 centers were registered. A comparison of 29 patients infected with HDV (registered in the concurrent HBV registry) was made against 785 HBV mono-infected patients. The seroprevalence of patients coinfected with HBV and HDV in Belgium is reported to be 3.7% (29/785), consisting solely of the HBV-HDV coinfected patients in the HBV registry. This rises to 5.5% (44/800) if all patients infected with HDV from the two registries combined are included. The patients coinfected with HBV and HDV had higher (P < 0.05) ALT values and more advanced liver disease (Metavir score ≥F2), but had less active HBV replication and lower HBV DNA titers when compared with the patients infected only with HBV. Additionally, the majority of HBV-HDV coinfected patient was male, and 13.6% (6/44) of the patients that were coinfected HBV and HDV were also infected with HCV. In conclusion, this study provided much needed epidemiological data on the current state of HDV infection in Belgium."
2954,0.004,4.0,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection treated with alpha interferon and subsequent loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) eliminate HDV. HDV RNA was detected in 26 of 28 patients with chronic delta hepatitis using the polymerase chain reaction. Seventeen patients in whom HDV RNA was detected were treated with alpha interferon; in 65%, HDV RNA remained detectable during treatment or reappeared after stopping therapy whereas in three patients HDV RNA remained absent (17.5%). HDV RNA became and remained undetectable in serum and liver of two of these three patients who lost HBsAg from serum and in one patient who was intermittently HBsAg negative during therapy. After loss of HBsAg, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was still detectable in the liver, but not HBV RNA, indicating absent or very low HBV replication. Three patients were lost to follow up (17.5%). Two nontreated patients with chronic HDV infection also lost HBsAg during follow up; HDV RNA also became undetectable in their serum. Thus, HDV replication does not persist after the loss of HBsAg. Clearance of HBsAg may be a useful guide to when therapy can be stopped."
1820,0.004,4.0,"One key step of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the integration of its viral cDNA. This process is mediated through complex networks of host-virus interactions that alter several normal cell functions of the host. To study the complexity of disturbances in cell gene expression networks by HIV-1 integration, we constructed a network of human macrophage genes located close to chromatin regions rich in proviruses. To perform the network analysis, we selected 28 genes previously identified as the target of cDNA integration and their transcriptional profiles were obtained from GEO Profiles (NCBI). A total of 2770 interactions among the 28 genes located around the HIV-1 proviruses in human macrophages formed a highly dense main network connected to five sub-networks. The overall network was significantly enriched by genes associated with signal transduction, cellular communication and regulatory processes. To simulate the effects of HIV-1 integration in infected macrophages, five genes with the most number of interaction in the normal network were turned off by putting in zero the correspondent expression values. The HIV-1 infected network showed changes in its topology and alteration in the macrophage functions reflected in a re-programming of biosynthetic and general metabolic process. Understanding the complex virus-host interactions that occur during HIV-1 integration, may provided valuable genomic information to develop new antiviral treatments focusing on the management of some specific gene expression networks associated with viral integration. This is the first gene network which describes the human macrophages genes interactions related with HIV-1 integration."
8848,0.004,4.0,"Using the Southern blot technique and cloned hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA as a probe, we studied the state of HBV DNA in the liver of 13 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 17 patients with chronic hepatitis, and 2 patients with acute hepatitis. The hybridization results were compared with the serological and immunohistological data. Integration of HBV DNA in cellular DNA of the liver from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was demonstrated. In two patients from which tumorous and nontumorous liver tissue samples were available the integration patterns were different. In one patient with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive early hepatocellular carcinoma, free viral DNA was present in the liver. In some patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis, without tumor, integration of HBV DNA in cellular DNA was also demonstrated. This suggests that HBV is not the only factor involved in the development of a tumor. In patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis, free viral DNA was detected in the liver. In the two acute hepatitis patients analyzed, the restriction endonuclease patterns strongly suggested HBV DNA integration. Therefore, viral DNA integration seems to occur early in infection. Whatever the form of the disease, discrete bands were observed, suggesting the existence of limited and specific integration sites in host cellular DNA. The presence of integrated or free DNA sequences has implications for antiviral therapy. In addition, detection of HBV DNA in the liver is another sensitive viral marker that could be useful for diagnostic purposes."
3898,0.004,4.0,"Retroviral integration requires cis-acting sequences at the termini of linear double-stranded viral DNA and a product of the retroviral pol gene, the integrase protein (IN). IN is required and sufficient for generation of recessed 3' termini of the viral DNA (the first step in proviral integration) and for integration of the recessed DNA species in vitro. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IN, expressed in Escherichia coli, was purified to near homogeneity. The substrate sequence requirements for specific cleavage and integration of retroviral DNA were studied in a physical assay, using purified IN and short duplex oligonucleotides that correspond to the termini of HIV DNA. A few point mutations around the IN cleavage site substantially reduced cleavage; most other mutations did not have a drastic effect, suggesting that the sequence requirements are limited. The terminal 15 bp of the retroviral DNA were demonstrated to be sufficient for recognition by IN. Efficient specific cutting of the retroviral DNA by IN required that the cleavage site, the phosphodiester bond at the 3' side of a conserved CA-3' dinucleotide, be located two nucleotides away from the end of the viral DNA; however, low-efficiency cutting was observed when the cleavage site was located one, three, four, or five nucleotides away from the terminus of the double-stranded viral DNA. Increased cleavage by IN was detected when the nucleotides 3' of the CA-3' dinucleotide were present as single-stranded DNA. IN was found to have a strong preference for promoting integration into double-stranded rather than single-stranded DNA."
5570,0.004,4.0,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are reported to have similar risk factors and similar recommendations apply to manage infected cats. However, some contrasting evidence exists in the literature with regard to commonly reported risk factors. In this study, we investigated whether the known risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections have a stronger effect for either infection. This retrospective study included samples from 696 cats seropositive for FIV and 593 cats seropositive for FeLV from the United States and Canada. Data were collected during two cross sectional studies, where cats were tested using IDEXX FIV/FeLV ELISA kits. To compare the effect of known risk factors for FIV infection compared to FeLV, using a case-case study design, random intercept logistic regression models were fit including cats' age, sex, neuter status, outdoor exposure, health status and type of testing facility as independent variables. A random intercept for testing facility was included to account for clustering expected in testing practices at the individual clinics and shelters."
3904,0.004,4.0,"A solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for determining human serum cystatin C is described. In 50 normal samples, cystatin C concentration was 1247 +/- 224 micrograms/L (mean +/- SD) which is in agreement with previously reported levels. Serum levels of cystatin C and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-M) were investigated in a time-course study during the development of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We found a persistent and uniform increase in the beta 2-M concentration (2762 +/- 1239 micrograms/L). In contrast to beta 2-M, on the basis of cystatin C levels, we found two distinct populations, one of which demonstrated an increased concentration (1620 +/- 618 micrograms/L). Interestingly a second group (21% of patients) exhibited an initial significant decrease in cystatin C concentration with a mean value of 377 (range 55-850) micrograms/L, followed by an increase. The biphasic pattern of cystatin C serum, a major cysteine proteinase inhibitor, during the course of HIV infection suggests a possible role for these proteinases (or proteinase inhibitors) in the development of this syndrome."
3876,0.004,4.0,"We assessed the longitudinal changes in blood myeloid dendritic cell (mDC) and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) populations in subjects with primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection undergoing different rates of disease progression. The relative level and degree of maturation of all cell populations decreased significantly in untreated individuals with acute infection. The most dramatic changes were observed in the rapid progressor group, correlating with their rate of clinical progression. Levels of mDCs remained lower than normal throughout follow-up for both rapid progressors who responded to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and untreated normal progressors. In contrast, mDC precursors were restored to normal levels during subsequent phases of infection in both rapid and normal progressors, and these levels were increased in long-term nonprogressors. pDC levels followed the pattern of CD4+ T cell fluctuations. These findings provide evidence for an ongoing process affecting mDCs after successful ART and despite nonprogressing clinical disease following HIV infection."
3503,0.004,4.0,"We have sought to address the problem of the host and tissue specificity of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) by using transgenic mice obtained after injection of head-to-tail dimers of the HBV genome. Viral DNA replication and protein synthesis were obtained in one of nine transgenic mice containing integrated HBV DNA. The RNAs encoding the HBV surface antigen and the core antigen were synthesized in the liver, the kidney, and the heart. In these organs, DNA replicative intermediates similar to those found during normal infection were associated with corelike structures. Large amounts of core polypeptides and capsids were detected in the nuclei in the absence of any pathological effect. These results show that the different steps of HBV multiplication can take place in nonliver nonhuman cells once the problem of entry into the host cell is overcome. In the absence of a small laboratory animal infectable by HBV, such transgenic mice should be helpful for the study of many aspects of viral multiplication."
1297,0.004,4.0,"Cross-sectional analyses have demonstrated an association between use of hormonal contraceptives and shedding of herpes simplex virus (HSV). This prospective study evaluated the effect of initiating use of hormonal contraception on cervical HSV detection. Two hundred women who were seropositive for HSV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 were examined for cervical mucosal HSV by use of quantitative DNA polymerase chain reaction before and after beginning the use of hormonal contraceptives. Cervical HSV was detected in 32 women (16.0%) before initiating and in 25 women (12.5%) after initiating use of hormonal contraception (P=.4). There were no significant differences in HSV shedding among the subgroups of women starting combination oral contraceptives containing both estrogen and progesterone or progesterone-only contraceptives. Among the 54 women who shed HSV at least once, the median change in cervical HSV after initiation of hormonal contraception was -313 copies/swab. In this prospective study, use of hormonal contraceptives did not increase detection of cervical HSV."
9951,0.004,4.0,"A randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted to examine the impact of a semistructured, 10-week, once weekly, 90-min/session bereavement support group intervention on immunological, neuroendocrine, and clinical health status in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-seropositive (HIV-1+) and HIV-1-seronegative (HIV-1-) homosexual men, compared to a standard of care control condition. A total of 119 homosexual men (74 HIV-1+ and 45 HIV-1-) were assessed at baseline, 10 weeks, and 6 months follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up assessment, the intervention groups exhibited significant beneficial effects compared to controls on changes in CD4 cell, total T-lymphocyte, and total lymphocyte counts, when baseline levels, antiretroviral medication use, CDC stage of disease, and other potentially confounding factors were accounted for. There was no statistically significant effect on the CD4/CD8 ratio or on the CD8 cell count. The effect on CD4 cell count was associated with group attendance and with changes in plasma cortisol level. Plasma cortisol levels decreased significantly among intervention subjects, compared to controls. A significantly reduced number of health care visits over the 6-month follow-up period among the intervention subjects supported the clinical relevance of the immunological changes observed for both HIV-1+ and HIV-1- individuals. These results indicate that behavioral interventions may have salutary immunological and clinical health effects following bereavement among HIV-1-infected individuals. The effect in HIV-1- individuals suggests that this bereavement support group intervention might have similar salutary effects in the general population. Potential effects of such interventions on clinical HIV disease progression are of interest and should be studied."
3271,0.004,4.0,"Columbia University's International Centre for AIDS Care and Treatment Programmes (ICAP) supports the establishment of HIV prevention, care and treatment programmes, in resource-limited countries, through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. In South Africa (SA), ICAP has collaborated with the Eastern Cape Department of Health since 2004, to support HIV treatment and care programmes at public healthcare facilities in rural and urban areas. Adherence, psychosocial and other supportive services have been combined into Wellness Programmes that have been situated within hospital-based Wellness Centres in two rural regions, and integrated within primary healthcare facilities in a third. This paper reviews components of wellness services for people living with HIV/AIDS including: voluntary counselling and testing, disclosure and prevention, ongoing counselling, health literacy and peer education, community- and home-based care, adherence support, and associated comprehensive care continuums. It also describes local context in which the Wellness Programmes were established. Finally it describes processes, successes and challenges, with programme development, and useful indicators monitored, lessons learned and strategies to strengthen and expand such programmes. Insights provided may inform other efforts to create sustainable systems of interdisciplinary care and accessible psychosocial support for HIV-infected persons within public facilities in resource-constrained settings."
4601,0.004,4.0,"Patients' adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is important for effective medical treatment of HIV/AIDS. We conducted a qualitative interview study in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia in 2006. The aim of the study was to explore patients' and health care professionals' perceived barriers and facilitators to patients' adherence to ART. Based on data from individual interviews and focus group interviews with a total of 60 patients and 12 health care professionals, we identified barriers and facilitators related to patients' beliefs and behaviours, the health service, and socio-economic and cultural factors. Among the barriers we identified were lack of communication and information about ART, inadequate time during consultations, lack of follow-up and counselling, forgetfulness, stigma, discrimination and disclosure of HIV status, lack of confidentiality in the treatment centres, and lack of nutritional support. Feeling better, prospects of living longer, family support, information about ART, support for income-generating activities, disclosure of HIV status, prayers and transport support were among the facilitators. Our study suggests that several issues need to be considered when providing ART. Further research is needed to study interactions between patients and their health care providers. Our findings can inform interventions to improve adherence to ART."
3709,0.004,4.0,"While community-based mental health services play an important role in caring for persons with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and co-existing mental health disorders, the extent to which their support needs are addressed in this setting is unknown. Accordingly, we examined if HIV infection was associated with unmet support needs among men living with and without HIV receiving community mental health care. This cross-sectional study examined 215 men (135 living with HIV and 80 without HIV) receiving case management services in urban Ontario. Using the Camberwell Assessment of Need, we ascertained the prevalence of support needs in 13 domains grouped into three clusters: Basic needs (accommodation, food, benefits, and money management); self-care/functional needs (daytime activities, self-care, and looking after the home); and health/safety needs (physical, psychological distress, psychotic symptoms, safety to self, and safety to others). We used generalized estimating equations with a logit link to examine the association between HIV and unmet need in each domain. Compared to HIV-negative men, men with HIV were more likely to have mood and concurrent disorders, and intellectual and developmental disabilities. Following multivariable analyses, men with HIV had greater unmet needs related to food (odds ratio + 95% confidence interval: 9.36 (4.03, 21.75), p < 0.001); money (OR: 1.90 (1.04, 3.47), p = 0.036) [basic need domains]; psychological distress (OR: 2.39 (1.68, 3.41), p < 0.001); drug use (OR: 5.10 (2.16, 12.08) p < 0.001); and safety to self (OR: 3.35 (1.51, 7.52), p < 0.003) [health and safety domains]. Despite living in a setting with universal health insurance, men with HIV receiving community mental health support had greater unmet need in basic and health domains than HIV-negative men receiving such support. Further research is required to develop and evaluate interventions to best support community-dwelling persons with HIV and mental health disorders."
2683,0.004,4.0,"The randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III DUET studies enrolled treatment-experienced, HIV-1-infected patients. We examined the genotypic and phenotypic changes at endpoint relative to baseline, including the emergence of individual reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations, in patients who received the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) etravirine and experienced virologic failure by rebound by the time of the Week 96 analysis. Patients received etravirine 200 mg twice-daily in combination with a background regimen containing darunavir/ritonavir, investigator-selected nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and optional enfuvirtide. Virologic failure by rebound occurred in 93 (15.5%) etravirine-treated patients (compared with 170 [28.1%] placebo-treated patients). Patients experiencing virologic failure had more baseline antiretroviral resistance and lower activity of the background regimen relative to those not experiencing failure. Emergence of NNRTI resistance-associated mutations was observed in 55 of 93 patients. The most frequently emerging RT mutations were V179F, V179I, and Y181C, with positions K101 and E138 also showing frequent changes. Mutations usually emerged in a background of multiple other NNRTI mutations and were, in most cases, associated with a decrease in phenotypic sensitivity to etravirine at endpoint. Further analysis is needed to clarify the role of mutations at position 138 as determinants of etravirine resistance."
7432,0.004,4.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis B virus share common routes of transmission, and hence, coinfection with these two viruses is common. Chronic hepatitis B does not influence the progression of HIV disease or the response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. It is clear, however, that HIV infection does impact the course of hepatitis B, as higher rates of chronic carriage, lower seroconversion rates, and accelerated progression towards cirrhosis have been observed. Vaccination against hepatitis B is less effective in HIV-infected individuals. Coinfected subjects have a poor response to interferon therapy. Lamivudine is more effective in coinfected subjects but must not be used as monotherapy because of the risk of resistance developing. Combination therapy with lamivudine and tenofovir has shown promise and is currently being investigated in clinical trials, while new drugs and other combinations are in development."
6179,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains resistant to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) may easily be selected for in vitro and in vivo under a suboptimal therapy regimen. Although cross-resistance is extensive within this class of compounds, newer NNRTIs were reported to retain activity against laboratory strains containing defined resistance-associated mutations. We have characterized HIV-1 resistance to loviride and the extent of cross-resistance to nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, HBY-097, and tivirapine in a set of 24 clinical samples from patients treated with long-term loviride monotherapy by using a recombinant virus assay. Genotypic changes associated with resistance were analyzed by population sequencing. Overall, phenotypic resistance to loviride ranged from 0.04 to 3.47 log10-fold. Resistance was observed in samples from patients who had discontinued loviride for up to 27 months. Cross-resistance to the other compounds was extensive; however, fold resistance to efavirenz was significantly lower than fold resistance to nevirapine. No genotypic changes were detected in three samples; these were sensitive to all of the NNRTIs tested. The most common genotypic change was the K103N substitution. The range of phenotypic resistance in samples containing the K103N substitution could not be predicted from a genotypic analysis of known NNRTI resistance-associated mutations. The Y181C substitution was detected in one isolate which was resistant to loviride and delavirdine but sensitive to efavirenz, HBY-097, and tivirapine. Our data indicate that the available newer NNRTIs which retain activity against some HIV-1 strains selected by other compounds of this class in vitro may have compromised clinical efficacy in some patients pretreated with NNRTI."
2026,0.004,4.0,"We estimate how the effect of antiretroviral treatment depends on the time from HIV-infection to initiation of treatment, using observational data. A major challenge in making inferences from such observational data arises from biases associated with the nonrandom assignment of treatment, for example bias induced by dependence of time of initiation on disease status. To address this concern, we develop a new class of Structural Nested Mean Models (SNMMs) to estimate the impact of time of initiation of treatment after infection on an outcome measured a fixed duration after initiation, compared to the effect of not initiating treatment. This leads to a SNMM that models the effect of multiple dosages of treatment on a time-dependent outcome, in contrast to most existing SNNMs, which focus on the effect of one dosage of treatment on an outcome measured at the end of the study. Our identifying assumption is that there are no unmeasured confounders. We illustrate our methods using the observational Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP) Core01 database on HIV. The current standard of care in HIV-infected patients is Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Treatment (HAART); however, the optimal time to start HAART has not yet been identified. The new class of SNNMs allows estimation of the dependence of the effect of 1 year of HAART on the time between estimated date of infection and treatment initiation, and on patient characteristics. Results of fitting this model imply that early use of HAART substantially improves immune reconstitution in the early and acute phase of HIV-infection."

Review of the literature on leptospirosis in HIV-infected persons showed that all patients were severely ill but responded well to treatment, which highlights the importance of recognizing this potentially life-threatening illness, especially in unusual settings."
1511,0.004,4.0,"With the increasing availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy, vertically infected children have a better chance of surviving into adolescence and adulthood. Additionally, sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a problem, and incidence and prevalence among youth remain high. Therefore, HIV-infected adolescents are becoming a more prominent sub-group in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Experience from the developed world indicates that providing effective care and treatment for adolescents poses unique challenges. This study aimed to identify the experiences and needs of adolescents growing up in care or on treatment for HIV in Cape Town, South Africa. Four focus groups interviews were conducted with a total of 26 young people attending an adolescent infectious diseases clinic at a tertiary hospital. Questions explored participant's perceptions on their present and future lives, and their self-identified needs. Focus groups revealed that adolescents viewed their illness negatively, but that social issues such as violence and poverty were also concerns. Despite these stressors, most respondents remained positive about the present and future, and wanted support for achieving their goals. As increasing numbers of HIV-infected children enter adolescence, healthcare providers and communities must find ways to support these young people to transition into adulthood."
8226,0.004,4.0,"Although HIV positive patients' adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is relatively high in African nations, as compared with industrialized nations, few studies have explored why. In the research presented here we aimed to understand the dynamics of good adherence to ART among patients receiving free ART and HIV-related services from a clinic in Arusha, Tanzania. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 6 health care providers and 36 patients at a health care center in Arusha in 2006. Interviews were conducted in Swahili using interview guides informed by social cognitive theory. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed in Kiswahili, translated into English and coded for themes and patterns with ATLAS.ti. Of the 36 patients interviewed (mean time on ART 9.8 months; range 1-23 months), 32 reported perfect adherence in the previous month. Self-reported adherence was high despite economic hardship, depression, low rates of HIV disclosure and high perceived HIV-associated stigma. Five factors emerged to explain excellent adherence in the face of such barriers. First, all respondents experienced substantial improvements in their health after starting ART; this supported their confidence in the medication and motivated them to adhere. Second, their perceived need to be able to meet their family responsibilities motivated respondents to stay healthy. Third, respondents developed specific strategies to remember to take pills, particularly routinizing pill-taking by linking it with daily activities or events. Fourth, material and emotional support received from others facilitated adherence. Finally, respondents trusted the advice and instructions of their health care providers, who regularly emphasized adherence. The facilitating factors identified were consistent with the constructs of social cognitive theory and highlighted the importance of interventions that address multiple levels of influence on adherence."
6954,0.004,4.0,"We documented HIV-risk behavior and the public health context of AIDS in women living with a severe and persistent mental illness. Sixty-one women were recruited from outpatient clinics and day-treatment programs at a state psychiatric hospital. They completed a survey that included measures of HIV-related risk behavior, the perceived importance of 11 public health and social problems including AIDS, HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, perceived risk, and behavioral intentions. Thirty-eight percent of participants engaged in at least one type of HIV-risk behavior during the 2 months before assessment, 23% reported two or more risk factors, and 16% reported three or more risk factors. Consistent condom use was rare. Participants reporting 1 or more risk factors were more likely than those reporting no risk to report histories of alcohol or drug treatment, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV testing, and more perceived risk of HIV infection. Poverty and unemployment were viewed as more serious problems than HIV infection and AIDS. HIV-prevention interventions that are tailored to the needs and priorities of women with a severe mental illness are urgently needed to prevent further infections."
4240,0.004,4.0,"Highly active antiretroviral treatment is compromised by viral resistance mutations. Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is therefore monitored closely, but follow-up studies of these patients are limited. Virus from 1405 individuals diagnosed with HIV-1 in Denmark between 2001 and 2009 was analyzed for TDR, and molecular-epidemiological links and progression of the infection were described based on data from standardized questionnaires, the prospective Danish HIV Cohort Study, and by phylogenetic analysis. Eighty-five individuals were found to be infected with virus harboring mutations resulting in a prevalence of 6.1%, with no changes over time. The main resistance mutations were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation 215 revertants, as well as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation 103N/S and protease inhibitor (PI) mutations 90M and 85V. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed 12 transmission chains involving 37 TDR individuals. Of these 21 were also documented epidemiologically. The virus included in the transmission chain carried similar resistance mutations to the TDR index case, whereas controls chains from index cases without TDR were generally without resistance mutations. We observed no difference in progression of the infection between individuals infected with TDR and individuals infected with wild-type HIV-1. The prevalence of TDR is low in Denmark and transmission of dual-drug-resistant HIV-1 is infrequent. The TDR isolates were shown to originate from local patients failing therapy."
878,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major issue among dialysis patients. It is associated with a high risk of hepatic complication. The liver disease runs a unique clinical course in dialysis patients, as it can progress with modest hepatic inflammation and prominent fibrosis. The conventional cut-off level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for commencing antiviral therapy may prove too high and inappropriate for dialysis patients, and liver biopsy appears to be the only definitive means to establish the activity of liver disease in dialysis patients. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with a serum ALT level that is persistently greater than 30 IU/L, or 0.75-fold the upper limit of the normal level, and/or other clinical and laboratory findings that suggest active liver disease. For antiviral treatment, preliminary reports have shown that lamivudine is effective and well tolerated in dialysis patients. However, the long-term efficacy of lamivudine and its optimal effective dose in dialysis patients remain unknown. The prevention of nosocomial transmission among dialysis patients is also important. Universal precaution measures should be strictly observed and the segregation of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive hemodialysis patients should be considered. For HBV non-immune patients, the importance of HBV vaccination should not be overemphasized. Until a new generation of highly immunogenic vaccines that are proven to be safe and effective in patients with end-stage renal disease becomes available, early vaccination before the development of end-stage renal failure remains the best way to secure immunological protection against HBV infection in dialysis patients."
904,0.004,4.0,"Adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) is a complex phenomenon and patients do not always adhere for a variety of reasons. The quality of communication and the therapeutic relationship between health professionals and patients have an important influence on adherence, as do contextual and environmental factors. Little qualitative research exists that examines health care interactions in the context of adherence counselling. This article presents a case study of a discussion about nonadherence between a pharmacy assistant and a patient in a South African HIV context. A hybrid analytical approach revealed various themes such as how the topic of nonadherence is addressed, participants' responses to the patient's nonadherence, and the process of negotiating a new commitment to adherence. The case provides insight into the impact of contextual factors on the interaction and challenges involved in discussing nonadherence-in particular, the patient's attempts to save face, the pharmacy assistant's irritation and anger, and the patient's expressed regrets. This case raises questions around issues of patient agency. Health professionals are encouraged to consider the influence of context, lifeworld, and culture on patients' ability to adhere to treatment regimens. By working to improve communication processes and strengthen the therapeutic relationship, patients may be empowered to achieve better adherence levels."
9394,0.004,4.0,"Taken as prescribed, that is, with high adherence, combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has changed HIV infection and disease from being a sure predictor of death to a manageable chronic illness. Adherence, however, is difficult to achieve and maintain. The CAPRISA 058 study was conducted between 2007 and 2009 to test the efficacy of individualized motivational counselling to enhance ART adherence in South Africa. As part of the overall trial, a qualitative sub-study was conducted, including 30 individual interviews and four focus group discussions with patients in the first 9 months of ART initiation. Data were inductively analyzed, using thematic analysis, to identify themes central to ART adherence in this context. Four themes emerged that characterize the participants' experiences and high motivation to adhere to ART. Participants in this study were highly motivated to adhere, as they acknowledged that ART was 'life-giving', in the face of a large amount of morbidity and mortality. They were further supported by techniques of routine remembering, and highlighted the importance of good social support and access to supportive healthcare workers, to their continued success in negotiating their treatment. Participants in the current study told us that their adherence motivation is enhanced by free accessible care, approachable and supportive healthcare workers, broad social acceptance of ART, and past first-hand experiences with AIDS-related co-morbidity and mortality. Programs that include specific attention to these aspects of care will likely be successful in the long term."
8125,0.004,4.0,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) increases the risk of tuberculosis (TB), and HIV TB coinfection is associated with higher mortality. This study aimed to characterize patients coinfected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV in a reference centre for cases involving complications or drug resistance in TB. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a Hospital for Tropical Diseases in the state of Goiás, Midwestern Brazil. Patients' medical records were reviewed between January 2008 and December 2009. Sixty-one cases of TB/HIV coinfection were evaluated, and 54 HIV-seronegative TB cases were selected as controls. The prevalence of TB HIV coinfected patients in 2008/2009 was 23%. Coinfection was more prevalent in men (75.4%), with a mean age of 37.1 years. Pulmonary disease (50.8%) was the most frequent clinical form of TB in coinfected patients, followed by disseminated disease (32.8%). Anaemia, malnutrition and low levels of CD4 T lymphocytes were found in about 80% of coinfected patients. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were the most common radiographic finding in coinfected patients (51.8%), and pulmonary cavitation was the rarest event (5.4%). The mortality rate was 2.8 times higher in the TB HIV coinfected group (39.3%) than in TB patients without HIV (18.5%). Actions targeting the TB HIV-coinfected population, based on national and international recommendations, are necessary to improve prognosis and outcomes in TB and HIV infection in the institution."
5997,0.004,4.0,"We compared the lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses to Cryptosporidium parvum in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and -seronegative patients. The lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses (interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, gamma interferon, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) were assessed for 11 HIV-seropositive, Cryptosporidium-positive (group I) patients; 20 HIV-seropositive, Cryptosporidium-negative (group II) patients; 10 HIV-seronegative, Cryptosporidium-positive (group III) patients, including four post-renal transplant (group IIIa) and 6 presumably immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients; and 20 HIV-seronegative, Cryptosporidium-negative healthy individuals (group IV). No significant difference was observed in the number of patients showing positive lymphoproliferative responses in group I compared to group III (post-renal transplant [group IIIa] or immunocompetent [group IIIb]) patients, while a comparison of the median stimulation indices shows that responses were significantly lower in Cryptosporidium-infected, immunosuppressed (group I and IIIa) patients than in immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients. The number of patients showing positive responses and median stimulation indices was significantly higher for Cryptosporidium-infected (HIV-seropositive and -seronegative) individuals than for uninfected individuals, suggesting that Cryptosporidium induces significant in vitro lymphoproliferative responses in infected individuals. Cytokine levels, except for that of IL-5, were significantly higher in Cryptosporidium-infected (groups I and III) individuals than in uninfected (groups II and IV) individuals. There was no significant difference between the group I and III patients and between Cryptosporidium-infected immunosuppressed (group I or IIIa) and immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients."
9447,0.004,4.0,"Enteroparasites are related to gastrointestinal alterations among patients with HIV/AIDS, some causing severe manifestations in the period before the institution of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The prevalence of enteroparasitoses in patients with HIV/AIDS seen at two hospitals in Ceará , Brazil, was compared in the pre-HAART (Group 1; n = 482) and HAART (Group 2; n = 100) eras. Fecal parasitologic examinations (FPE) were performed using the direct, Lutz, Baermann-Moraes and modified Ziehl-Neelsen methods. The following parasites were detected in Groups 1 and 2, respectively: Strongyloides stercoralis--30.1% and 11% (p<0.0001), Ascaris lumbricoides--15.6% and 2% (p<0.0001), hookworms--3.7% and 2% (p<0.0001), Trichuris trichiura--13.1% and 1% (p<0.0001), Hymenolepis nana--0 and 1% (p = 0.1718), Giardia duodenalis--7.9% and 1% (p = 0.0076), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar--3.3% and 1% (p = 0.3301), Isospora belli--4.8% and 1% (p = 0.0993), Cryptosporidium sp.--8.1% and 0 (p = 0.0007), and non-pathogenic protozoans as well. There was a significant reduction in the prevalence of enteroparasites between the eras (63.9% to 24%; p<0.0001). In the HAART era, the following observations were made: greater frequency of enteroparasites in patients without antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.0575), as in those with AIDS (p = 0.08), and diarrhea (36% of the patients); lack of association with positive FPE (p = 0.626); and non-detection of Cryptosporidium sp. Strongyloides stercoralis showed an elevated prevalence in the two eras and was more frequent in men (32.41%) than women (19.04%) of Group 1 (p = 0.018), a finding suggesting the transmission of the helminth through sodomy. The advent of the HAART modified the profile of opportunistic infections, including parasites, probably due to the reconstitution of cellular immunity and the direct action of HAART on the parasites."
9387,0.004,4.0,"Measurement of quality of life is crucial to assess the full impact of antiretroviral therapy on patient morbidity. No quality of life instruments have been validated in an Asian HIV-infected patient population, but it is important to do so given the increasing involvement of the region in clinical trials. We set out to validate the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) in HIV infected patients in Singapore. Clinically stable outpatients were asked to complete the 30-item MOS-HIV (English or Chinese translation). Patients were also asked about the frequency of selected disease symptoms, and clinical and demographic data were recorded from the case sheet. 163 patients (90% Chinese, 96% male, mean age 38 years, mean CD4 count 159 cells/mm(3)) participated in the study and completed the questionnaire to a satisfactory standard. The questionnaire showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >0.7 in all cases). There were significant differences in quality of life scores between Centers for Disease Control disease stages, and significant correlations with CD4 count and symptom score, confirming the discriminant validity of the MOS-HIV. Factor analysis revealed two components corresponding to physical and mental health which were similar to those of studies in Western countries except that pain was more closely related to mental than physical health. Linear regression analysis identified symptom burden as the major predictor of physical and mental health. We concluded that the MOS-HIV is a valid measure of quality of life in this HIV patient population in Singapore, and is therefore likely to be useful in future clinical trials in the region. In the era of chronic HIV disease, close attention to symptoms (disease or drug-related) is warranted due to their major adverse influence on mental and physical aspects of quality of life."
9415,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is classified into subtypes on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of sequence differences. Inter- and intra-subtype polymorphism extends throughout the genome, including the long terminal repeat (LTR). In this study, the importance of the upstream stimulating factor (USF)-binding site (E-box) in the core-negative regulatory element (NRE) of the LTR of HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D, E and G was investigated. In vivo, USF was found to repress transcription directed from representative HIV-1 LTR sequences of all the subtypes tested in an epithelial cell line, yet activate the same transcription in a T-cell line. Mutation of the core-NRE USF site of the representative subtype B LTR did not affect the cell-specific, subtype-independent, dual role of USF. In vitro binding assays showed that recombinant USF(43) interacts with the core-NRE from subtypes B and C, but not A, D, E or G. Thus, USF affects LTR-directed transcription in a cell-specific manner, independently of both the HIV-1 subtype from which the LTR was derived and the core-NRE USF site sequences."
9892,0.004,4.0,"There is increasing evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections with different genotypes and subgenotypes differ in response to treatment and long-term prognosis. The differences emerge from variability within the genomes that leads to structural deviations at the pregenomic level and to changes at the translational level. Naturally occurring HBV strains covering the four major genotypes A-D were obtained from 393 patients and part of the genome was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequenced, and analyzed for mutational differences in the precore and core promoter regions. The study confirmed that core promoter and precore mutations occur at key positions (A1762T, G1764A, G1896A, and G1899A), and that the proportions of strains with seroconvertion in patients differ between the four HBV genotypes. A rare double mutation (C1857T together with G1897A) was observed, and C1856T was found together with the emerging G1898A mutation, which itself was found to be more widespread geographically than previously described. We found a novel mutation (T1850C), never before observed in human HBV strains but known from woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV). A novel association of mutation C1773T with G1764T, C1766A, and G1757A was also found within a site already suggested to be a putative binding site for HNF-3. This novel association is proposed by us to be of importance for additional binding of HNH-2 to this site and is a better indicator of the emergence of the double mutation G1764T and C1766A than the G1757A mutation proposed previously."
3179,0.004,4.0,"The number of hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier babies has decreased markedly since the introduction in Japan of an ""at-risk"" strategy for preventing HBV infection. However, elimination of HBV infection from our country appears difficult. To clarify the limitations of the at-risk strategy for preventing vertical transmission of HBV, causes of vertical transmission in a single hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The following causes were presumed in 17 carrier pediatric cases: five patients had prenatal HBV infection, HBV infection during/after the immunization program was confirmed in five cases, two patients had prenatal infection or infection during the immunization program and three cases were caused by human error (by the patients' guardians). Because their mothers were HBV-negative at screening and only developed acute hepatitis B in the perinatal period, another two cases (Cases 3 and 10) did not undergo immunization because they were not subjects of the at-risk strategy. Sequence analyses in ten patients revealed genotype C (subgenotype, C2/Ce) in nine cases and genotype A (subgenotype, A2/Ae) in one case (Case 3). In Japan, HBV subgenotype Ae has recently been found more frequently among sexually active men with acute hepatitis. There are concerns that horizontal transmission of HBV from these men to their pregnant partners could increase. These data suggest clear limitations to the at-risk strategy in Japan and the possibility that the increase in genotype A may influence vertical transmission of HBV."
6454,0.004,4.0,"The implementation of antiretroviral therapy demands the need for increased access to viral load (VL) monitoring. Newer real-time VL testing technologies are faster and have larger dynamic ranges and fully automated extraction to benefit higher throughputs in resource-poor environments. The Abbott RealTime human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) assay was evaluated as a new option for testing for HIV-1 subtype C in South Africa, and its performance was compared to the performance of existing assays (the Cobas AmpliPrep-Cobas TaqMan HIV-1, version 1, assay; the AmpliPrep-Cobas Monitor standard HIV-1 assay; and the NucliSENS EasyQ-EasyMag HIV-1 assay) in a high-throughput laboratory. The total precision of the RealTime HIV-1 assay was acceptable over all viral load ranges. This assay compared most favorably with the Cobas AmpliPrep-Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 assay (R(2) = 0.904), with a low standard deviation of difference being detected (0.323 copies/ml). The bias against comparator assays ranged from -0.001 copies/ml to -0.228 copies/ml. Variability in the reporting of VLs for a 20-member subtype panel compared to the variability of other assays was noted with subtypes G and CRF02-AG. The RealTime HIV-1 assay can test 93 samples per day with minimal manual preparation, less staff, and the minimization of contamination through automation. This assay is suitable for HIV-1 subtype C VL quantification in South Africa."
1434,0.004,4.0,"Patients with resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection undergoing chemo- or immunosuppressive therapy are at potential risk for HBV reactivation. To determine whether the host immune response contributes to liver injury, we performed an immunological analysis of a patient with HBV reactivation. Consistent with the detection of HBV DNA in the sera, the number of polyclonal HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) gradually increased; however, the number of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) decreased. The interaction between HBV-specific CTLs and CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg is an important determinant of liver injury during HBV reactivation. Therefore, monitoring the number of these cells might be a useful modality for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis resulting from HBV reactivation. "
7462,0.004,4.0,"The 1990 report of a cluster of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated with a Florida dentist with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome attracted considerable media coverage and legislative attention. A number of polls found that the public favored mandatory HIV-antibody testing of health-care workers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga, conducted a two-phase study to understand how public concerns regarding potential HIV transmission in health-care settings can be addressed by the medical and public health communities."
2010,0.004,4.0,"BACKGROUND In November and December 2012, 6 patients at a hemodialysis clinic were given a diagnosis of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. OBJECTIVE To investigate the outbreak to identify risk factors for transmission. METHODS A case patient was defined as a patient who was HCV-antibody negative on clinic admission but subsequently was found to be HCV-antibody positive from January 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013. Patient charts were reviewed to identify and describe case patients. The hypervariable region 1 of HCV from infected patients was tested to assess viral genetic relatedness. Infection control practices were evaluated via observations. A forensic chemiluminescent agent was used to identify blood contamination on environmental surfaces after cleaning. RESULTS Eighteen case patients were identified at the clinic from January 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013, resulting in an estimated 16.7% attack rate. Analysis of HCV quasispecies identified 4 separate clusters of transmission involving 11 case patients. The case patients and previously infected patients in each cluster were treated in neighboring dialysis stations during the same shift, or at the same dialysis station on 2 consecutive shifts. Lapses in infection control were identified. Visible and invisible blood was identified on multiple surfaces at the clinic. CONCLUSIONS Epidemiologic and laboratory data confirmed transmission of HCV among numerous patients at the dialysis clinic over 6 years. Infection control breaches were likely responsible. This outbreak highlights the importance of rigorous adherence to recommended infection control practices in dialysis settings."

6268,0.004,4.0,"Nine black children aged between 3 months and 30 months of age, with human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) infection are described to draw the attention of health professionals in southern Africa to special clinical characteristics useful for recognising this problem, which has many shared features with common diseases of infancy and childhood in the Third World. The main presenting complaints were chronic cough and persistent diarrhoea and vomiting. These children frequently had diarrhoea (8 of 9 patients), mucocutaneous candidiasis (8), pneumonia (7), hepatosplenomegaly (9), significant lymphadenopathy (5) and wasting (5). All were infected by common bacteria, such as Gram-negative organisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Campylobacter jejuni, or by opportunistic infections such as Candida or cytomegalovirus (CMV), or by both bacterial and opportunistic organisms. A raised total serum globulin level, anaemia, lymphopenia and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis were frequent findings. Incomplete data on parental HIV status suggest perinatal transmission. Three of the children were HIV-antigen positive. The diagnosis of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), using the stringent Centers for Disease Control criteria, is difficult in our situation because of limited diagnostic resources; however, using these criteria, and the clinical case definition for AIDS recommended by World Health Organisation, it is thought that probably 4 of these children could be considered as having AIDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
6065,0.004,4.0,"Blood transfusion is an important mode of transmission of infections to the recipient. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections and the possible risk factors among blood donors. During the study period (1994-99) donor samples were screened for HBsAg, HIV, HCV and Syphilis. The relevant donor history was examined to identify the risk factors leading to transfusion transmissible infections. The prevalence of infection was 3.1% among donors, with HBsAg constituting 1.3%, HCV 1.4%, HIV 0.2% and RPR 0.2%. In a classification based on occupation, class III donors (drivers, Businessmen & men in uniform) showed a significantly higher incidence of transfusion transmissible infections for HIV (0.38%) and Syphilis (0.36%). Health care workers constituted only a small fraction of the study; prevalence of infections was low among them. History of jaundice or hospitalization was not associated with higher incidence of seropositivity. Seropositivity for HIV is relatively low compared to similar studies conducted in other regions of the country. This finding is attributed to the pre donation counseling in donor selection. An important outcome of the study is that Class III donors form a high-risk group for transfusion transmissible infections."

10005,0.004,4.0,"North American mission boards (N = 82) with programs in sub-Saharan Africa were surveyed to identify practices affecting risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection among international staff. Thirty-four percent of participating boards thought risk for HIV-1 infection in missionaries in Africa was greater than it was for the general US population, and 53% considered it greater for overseas medical staff serving in the region than for domestic health care workers. Nevertheless, only 24% of boards had formal AIDS education programs for overseas health care workers, and 19% for nonmedical personnel going abroad. Medical care provision and acquisition were considered high-risk activities; 42% of boards with a known policy acknowledged that disposable injection equipment was routinely reused, 68% indicated that immunizations were provided abroad, and 60% admitted that inoculations were administered by indigenous health care workers. The most frequently cited specific suggestion for decreasing the risk of HIV-1 infection overseas was the implementation of a walking blood bank program. We conclude that current practices and logistic constraints make HIV-1 transmission possible. Risk reduction strategies include more comprehensive health education programs, greater adherence to universal precautions, less dependence on the indigenous Third World health care system, and implementation of innovative programs for health care delivery."
5762,0.004,4.0,"The worldwide implementation of free antiretroviral therapy (ART) raised great hopes among policy makers and health organisations about the positive changes it would bring about in attitudes and behaviours towards HIV and AIDS, as well as for infected people's lives. A change in illness perception was anticipated, leading to the hypothesis of a possible change in disclosure rates, patterns and the choice of significant others to inform. In the era of free treatment availability in the United Republic of Tanzania, we examined reasons for disclosure and non-disclosure among HIV-seropositive women enrolled on ART and their choice of significant others to inform. In so doing, we contribute to the necessary yet neglected debate about the social impact of ART on the lives of infected women. The study, for which an ethnographic cross-sectional pilot approach was chosen, was conducted at the Care and Treatment Center (CTC) at Bombo Regional Hospital (BRH) in Tanga city, Tanzania. Data presented here derive from participant observation, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews conducted with 59 HIV-seropositive women on ART. Interestingly, and despite treatment availability, the choice of significant others to inform, as well as reasons for disclosure and non-disclosure, mirror findings from previous studies conducted before the introduction of free ART. The main reason for non-disclosure was fear of discrimination. The hope for social, economic or health support was the main motivation for disclosure, followed by the need for a 'clinic companion' in order to receive ART, as requested by hospital staff. Nevertheless, healthcare staff were not unanimous in thinking that disclosure is always beneficial, thus the recommended extent of disclosure varied. ART and concomitant factors were raised as an entirely new and significant reason for disclosure by interviewees. Finally, findings confirm that despite ART, disclosure remains a highly stressful event for women. "
4724,0.004,4.0,"Knowledge about epidemiological distribution patterns of HIV infection in different geographic regions is relevant to understand the dynamics of the disease in Brazil. This study aims to characterize the epidemiological and clinical profile of HIV-infected patients from Southwestern Goias State, from 2005 to 2015. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect clinical-epidemiological, virological, and immunological data from the medical records of all HIV-infected patients (n=539) who were followed at the regional reference center of Jatai, Goias State, Brazil, from 2005 to 2015. We detected the prevalence of male patients and the heterosexual route of transmission, as well as an expressive number of young women infected with HIV. The HIV infection was more prevalent in reproductive ages (55.3%). Most patients presented clinical manifestations related to HIV infection at the time of diagnosis. Twenty-four patients presented coinfection with hepatitis C virus, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, leprosy or Chagas disease. Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii was the most common opportunistic infection, followed by neurotoxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and neurocryptococcosis. Combined antiretroviral therapy improved CD4+ T-cell counts: the mean CD4+ T-cell counts after treatment was twice as high as those found at the first medical appointment; and highly active antiretroviral therapy promoted viral suppression in a significant number of patients. Considering the increasing distribution of HIV infection to the interior of Brazil, this descriptive study outlines the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of HIV infection in Southwestern Goias and contributes to develop local prevention strategies and public service plans."
166,0.004,4.0,"To determine whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains in the lungs of infected individuals are derived from proviral forms contemporaneously present in the peripheral blood or whether they evolve independently as an autonomous pool of viral quasispecies, HIV-1 envelope V3 domain structures at these sites were analyzed and compared. The V3 loop proviral nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequences from lung bronchoalveolar lavage, where HIV-1 is primarily found in macrophages, were more homogeneous within individuals than those from unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where virus is predominantly in T cells. Comparison between individuals revealed that strains from bronchoalveolar lavage, but not from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, contained V3 domain nucleotide sequences with a great degree of homogeneity in the C-terminal region and a highly conserved, negatively charged amino acid motif. This V3 loop C-terminal structure could be important in the ability of HIV-1 to infect alveolar macrophages. Phylogenetic analyses of V3 domain nucleotide sequences in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage at both sites revealed the strains in lung macrophages to have evolved further from a presumed ancestral species than those in blood monocytes and to differ considerably in the inferred V3 loop amino acid structures. These results show that, as disease progression occurs, viral strains in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells within the lung and blood microenvironments are not in a state of unrestricted bidirectional traffic but, instead, evolve independently."

This process may evolve with adverse clinical phenomena, known as the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). In the HIV population, non-tuberculous mycobacteria are a common cause of IRIS. However, only a few cases of Mycobacterium xenopi associated IRIS have been described. This paper concerns a case of M. xenopi pulmonary infection resulting in self-limited immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in an HIV-1 infected patient."
5992,0.004,4.0,"In HIV-infected patients a low CD4:CD8 ratio can persist despite CD4 recovery with long-term antiretroviral treatment (ART). As CD4:CD8 inversion is considered a marker of immune-senescence, we aimed to assess if it was associated with the chronic inflammation state in aging patients with HIV. A total of 112 patients with a >15 year history of HIV infection and ART were included, 85 of whom were suppressed. All subjects were tested for interleukin (IL)-6, high-sensitivity (hs)-PCR, and D-dimer levels. Complete clinical, therapeutic, and hematochemical data were retrieved. Coreceptor tropism based on HIV-DNA gp120 genotyping was also available within the past 6 months. A progressive increase in the CD4:CD8 ratio over time was observed without reaching a plateau. Based on the CD4:CD8 ratio at the time of testing, patients were classified into group A (normal ratio ≥0.9) and group B (<0.9). A normal ratio was observed in 37% of patients. Variables associated with an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio were older age, nadir CD4, and detectable HIV viremia. No association between HIV subtype, coreceptor tropism, cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfections and CD4:CD8 ratio was observed. Group B patients showed a trend for a higher frequency of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia compared to group A patients, but they did not differ in IL-6, hs-PCR, and D-dimer levels or in frequency of severe non-AIDS-associated events. In conclusion, CD4:CD8 ratio normalization occurs rarely, even after several years of ART. Chronic inflammation in patients aging with HIV does not seem to be directly dependent on the CD4:CD8 ratio. However, the persistent immune dysregulation expressed by a CD4:CD8 inversion might be linked to a higher risk of non-AIDS events, especially metabolic disorders."
1865,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) infects about two million people worldwide. HIV-2 has fewer treatment options than HIV-1, yet may evolve drug resistance more quickly. We have analysed several novel drugs for anti-HIV-2 activity. It was observed that 5-azacytidine, clofarabine, gemcitabine and resveratrol have potent anti-HIV-2 activity. The EC50 values for 5-azacytidine, clofarabine and resveratrol were found to be significantly lower with HIV-2 than with HIV-1. A time-of-addition assay was used to analyse the ability of these drugs to interfere with HIV-2 replication. Reverse transcription was the likely target for antiretroviral activity. Taken together, several novel drugs have been discovered to have activity against HIV-2. Based upon their known activities, these drugs may elicit enhanced HIV-2 mutagenesis and therefore be useful for inducing HIV-2 lethal mutagenesis. In addition, the data are consistent with HIV-2 reverse transcriptase being more sensitive than HIV-1 reverse transcriptase to dNTP pool alterations. "
4382,0.004,4.0,"We have been investigating a long-term nonprogressor who was found to be human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositive in 1985 and has survived with stable CD4+ T-cell counts (>1,000 CD4 cells/microl) without any AIDS-related illness. We have previously reported that repeated attempts to measure HIV-1 RNA in the peripheral mononuclear cells obtained from this subject have invariably failed. In the present study, we have analyzed the molecular nature of the HIV-1 quasispecies infecting this patient by PCR amplification of two proviral regions, the 5' long terminal repeat (5'LTR)/gag leader and the nef gene, directly from fresh uncultured peripheral mononuclear cells, followed by length polymorphism analysis (with 1994, 1995, and 1996 samples) and sequencing (with a 1996 sample). Only proviral forms with nef deletions were revealed by length polymorphism analysis in samples from all three time points. Sequence analysis of the nef gene from the 1996 sample confirmed the presence of similar proviral quasispecies characterized by the presence of several deletions located in the nef-alone and the nef/U3 overlapping regions. Length polymorphism analysis of the 5'LTR/gag leader region suggested the existence of two major quasispecies populations, one characterized by the presence of forms carrying deletions in the U3 region and the other showing a completely intact, full-length 5'LTR. Evidence of the role of nef gene defects in long-term survival of HIV-1-infected patients has been provided so far in two independent investigations involving patients infected with HIV through blood transfusion. Here we show the existence of a similar condition in a subject who acquired HIV-1 seropositivity through the sexual route."

Sixty-six patients with CHB were enrolled. Hepatitis markers and hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV-Ab) were tested using micro particle enzyme immunoassay kits. Viral load was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the mutation was analyzed by nested PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Most of CHB patients were HBeAg (-ve). The HBeAg status did not have an influence on the presence or absence of T1762/A1764 mutation. HBV-DNA serum level was not significantly different in patients with core mutation and patients without core mutation in HBeAg (-ve) group, while in HBeAg (+ve) group HBV-DNA serum level was significantly higher in patients with core mutation.

Forty two of the patients (65%) and 25 controls (36%) were HBsAg positive. Anti-HBc was demonstrated in over 80% and in 84% of the study groups respectively. Over 70% of hepatitis B infection was anicteric and traditional surgical intervention correlated with prevalence of PLC. The data provide support for the etiological role of HBV in Nigerian patients with PLC; this is the first report that the incidence of PLC is highest in the northern Savannah region of Nigeria.
2430,0.004,4.0,"As thymocyte infection may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for CD4+ T lymphocyte depletion in HIV-1-infected individuals, we studied the occurrence of HIV-1 infection in the thymus in vivo. Thymus (THYPD) and peripheral blood (PBLPD) primary viral isolates were obtained from an HIV-1-infected patient; restriction pattern analysis revealed the presence of a viral variant (THY) in the thymus isolate, from which biological viral clones containing this variant were obtained by limiting dilution infection of Molt-3 cells. The biological phenotype of the viral isolates and THY clones was studied in different cell lines and primary cultures. PBLPD, THYPD, and THY clones could efficiently infect T cell lines; the thymic variant showed a higher cytopathic activity in T cell lines, and a higher replication capacity in both unfractionated and CD4+CD8(+)-enriched primary thymocytes. Sequence analysis of the viral population patterns in vivo confirmed the presence of the THY variant in the thymic compartment, and revealed that the degree of V3 loop heterogeneity was higher in the thymocytes of the patient than in the peripheral blood lymphocytes. In addition to confirming thymocyte infection in vivo, our data also indicate that a differential distribution of viral variants may occur among different body compartments in a single individual; the emergence of cytopathic and tissue-specific variants in the thymus may play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease."
2509,0.004,4.0,"CD8+ T lymphocytes of HIV-1-infected individuals can efficiently suppress HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T lymphocytes. To elucidate the molecular events underlying this suppression, we have used the HIV-1 LTR directing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT) in transient transfection assays using human Jurkat T cells. In addition to supernatants of patient CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD4+ > 350/microliters), supernatant of a T cell clone derived by Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-mediated transformation of CD8+ T lymphocytes of a patient demonstrating inhibition of virus replication were examined. Similar levels of inhibition of LTR-mediated gene expression in response to Tat or mitogenic activation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore were observed by supernatants of both sources. The inhibitory effect of CD8+ T lymphocytes was not exclusive to lentiviral LTRs since transcription of both the HTLV-I LTR and RSV LTR in response to mitogen was effectively inhibited. In examination of the influence of CD8+ T cell-derived supernatant on NF kappa B-mediated activation, a dimer of the HIV-1 NF kappa B elements directing CAT was markedly inhibited by supernatants of both patient CD8+ lymphocytes and the HVS-derived CD8+ clone. Thus the inhibitory nature of CD8+ T lymphocytes appears not to be specific to lentiviral promoters and may mediate an inhibitory effect via the NF kappa B element."
5453,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and tuberculosis (TB) are overlapping epidemics that cause an immense burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa. This region is home to the majority of the world's co-infected patents, who have higher TB case fatality and recurrence rates than patients with TB alone. A World Health Organization interim policy has been developed to reduce the joint burden of TB-HIV disease, an important component of which is provision of HIV care to co-infected patients. This review focuses on HIV testing of TB patients and, for those who are HIV-positive, the administration of adjunctive cotrimoxazole preventive treatment (CPT) and antiretroviral treatment (ART). HIV testing has moved from a voluntary, client-initiated intervention to one that is provider-initiated and a routine part of the diagnostic work-up. The efficacy and safety of CPT in HIV-infected patients is now well established, and this is an essential part of the package of HIV care. ART scale-up in Africa can substantially improve outcomes in co-infected patients. However, the clinical and programmatic challenges of combining ART with anti-tuberculosis treatment need to be resolved to realise the full potential of this benefit. These include the optimal time to start ART, how best to combine rifampicin-containing regimens with first-line and second-line ART regimens, management of immune reconstitution disease, the role of isoniazid preventive treatment with ART after TB treatment completion, and where and how to provide combined treatment to best suit the patient. Clinical and operational studies in the next few years should help to resolve some of these issues."

This study characterized the prevalence of cigarette smoking among HIV-infected Russian women and examined the association between smoking frequency and quantity and HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. HIV-infected Russian women (N = 250; M age = 30.0) in St. Petersburg, Russia, completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview survey assessing cigarette use, antiretroviral medication adherence, and provided blood samples assayed for HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. The majority (60.4%) reported cigarette smoking in the past month; 49.0% of recent smokers were classified as moderate or heavy smokers, defined as smoking ≥10 cigarettes daily. Viral load status did not differ between infrequent smokers and regular smokers. However, moderate/heavy smokers (relative to light smokers) were more likely to have a detectable viral load (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.1). There were no significant differences in CD4+ lymphocyte counts by smoking frequency or quantity of cigarettes smoked. Results highlight the need for additional research to examine the association between cigarette smoking and virologic suppression and markers of HIV disease progression. Adverse health consequences of cigarette smoking coupled with a potential link between heavy smoking and poor virologic suppression highlight the need for assessment of cigarette use and provision of evidence-based smoking-cessation interventions within HIV medical care."

Subjects were contacted prior to a scheduled appointment and asked to bring all their medications to the visit. Daily total pill burden and medication type were recorded. 151 subjects were recruited: 76% male, 58% African American, 97% receiving antiretrovirals (ARVs). Median age was 48 (IRQ: 42-54) years. The median number of medications per subject was 8 (IQR: 6-11), and the median individual daily pill burden was 8 pills (IQR: 5-15): 3 pills (range: 2-5) for ARVs and 6 (range: 3-12.5) pills for non-ARVs. Duration of ART (per 2 years increase) and more than 3 co-morbidities was significantly associated with high pill burden (over 10 pills per day) with adjusted OR of 2.09 (95% CI, 1.14-3.84) and 8.04 (95% CI, 2.30-28.15), respectively.

1553,0.004,4.0,"Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and C virus (HCV) are common in patients with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB). This is a cross-sectional study with patients infected with HIV/AIDS and active TB in Recife, Brazil, aiming to verify the prevalence of markers for HBV: antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc); and HCV: antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) by chemiluminescence, and to identify the frequency of associated factors. Data were collected through questionnaires, and blood was drawn from patients for analysis. We used the chi-square test and the Fisher exact test when necessary. We conducted a bivariate logistic regression analysis and the magnitude of the associations was expressed as odds ratio (OR) with a confidence interval of 95%. Among 166 patients studied with HIV/AIDS and active TB, anti-HBc was positive in 61 patients [36.7%; 95%CI (29.4-44.6%)] and anti-HCV in 11[6.6%; 95%CI (3.4-11.5%)]. In the logistic regression analysis, male sex, and age ≥40 years were independent factors associated with the occurrence of anti-HBc. In conclusion, we verified a high frequency of HBV contact marker and a low frequency of HCV markers in patients with HIV/AIDS and TB in Recife."
8847,0.004,4.0,Recent studies have suggested that host genetics may be useful for predicting drug response and have supported the recommendation that single polynucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL28B should be investigated when treating hepatitis C virus (HCV)-1 infected patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether a single IL-28B genotype SNP rs8099917 or rs12979860 determination is sufficient to predict treatment failure in patients with chronic HCV.
4469,0.004,4.0,"Hospital infection control measures are crucial to tuberculosis (TB) control strategies within settings caring for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, as these patients are at heightened risk of developing TB. Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a potent drug that effectively sterilizes persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli. However, PZA resistance associated with mutations in the nicotinamidase/pyrazinamidase coding gene, pncA, is increasing. A total of 794 patient isolates obtained from four sites in Lima, Peru, underwent spoligotyping and drug resistance testing. In one of these sites, the HIV unit of Hospital Dos de Mayo (HDM), an isolation ward for HIV/TB coinfected patients opened during the study as an infection control intervention: circulating genotypes and drug resistance pre- and postintervention were compared. All other sites cared for HIV-negative outpatients: genotypes and drug resistance rates from these sites were compared with those from HDM. HDM patients showed high concordance between multidrug resistance, PZA resistance according to the Wayne method, the two most common genotypes (spoligotype international type [SIT] 42 of the Latino American-Mediterranean (LAM)-9 clade and SIT 53 of the T1 clade), and the two most common pncA mutations (G145A and A403C). These associations were absent among community isolates. The infection control intervention was associated with 58-92% reductions in TB caused by SIT 42 or SIT 53 genotypes (odds ratio [OR] = 0.420, P = 0.003); multidrug-resistant TB (OR = 0.349, P < 0.001); and PZA-resistant TB (OR = 0.076, P < 0.001). In conclusion, pncA mutation typing, with resistance testing and spoligotyping, was useful in identifying a nosocomial TB outbreak and demonstrating its resolution after implementation of infection control measures."
3524,0.004,4.0,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified host genetic variation to be critical for predicting treatment response and spontaneous clearance in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). These important new studies are reviewed and their future clinical implications discussed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the region of the IL28B gene on chromosome 19, coding for the interferon (IFN)-λ-3 or IL28B gene, are strongly associated with treatment response to pegylated IFN and ribavirin in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. The good response variant is associated with a twofold increase in the rate of cure. Allele frequencies differ between ethnic groups, largely explaining the observed differences in response rates between Caucasians, African Americans and Asians. IL28B polymorphism is also strongly associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV. The biological mechanisms responsible for these genetic associations remain unknown and are the focus of ongoing research. Knowledge of a patient's IL28B genotype is likely to aid in clinical decision making with standard of care regimens. Future studies will investigate the possibility of individualizing treatment duration and novel regimens according to IL28B type."
1501,0.004,4.0,"Administering and monitoring therapy is crucial to the battle against HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Electronic medical records (EMRs) can aid in documenting care, monitoring drug adherence and response to therapy, and providing data for quality improvement and research. Faculty at Moi University in Kenya and Indiana and University in the USA opened adult and pediatric HIV clinics in a national referral hospital, a district hospital, and six rural health centers in western Kenya using a newly developed EMR to support comprehensive outpatient HIV/AIDS care. Demographic, clinical, and HIV risk data, diagnostic test results, and treatment information are recorded on paper encounter forms and hand-entered into a central database that prints summary flowsheets and reminders for appropriate testing and treatment. There are separate modules for monitoring the Antenatal Clinic and Pharmacy. The EMR was designed with input from clinicians who understand the local community and constraints of providing care in resource poor settings. To date, the EMR contains more than 30,000 visit records for more than 4000 patients, almost half taking antiretroviral drugs. We describe the development and structure of this EMR and plans for future development that include wireless connections, tablet computers, and migration to a Web-based platform."
9930,0.004,4.0,"Protection of older persons, particularly those with diabetes, against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is of growing concern because of increased reports of outbreaks among long-term care facility residents receiving assisted blood glucose monitoring. We evaluated hepatitis B vaccine immunogenicity among residents immunized in response to two such outbreaks in skilled nursing facilities during June 2009-July 2010. One hundred forty-eight (71%) of 209 residents were found to be susceptible to HBV infection. Of 105 patients who began a vaccination series with Twinrix(®) (0-, 1-, 6-month dosing), 86 (82%) completed the series and postvaccination testing. Of these, most were elderly (median age 79.5 years; range 45-101), female (56%), and African-American (51%). Twenty-nine (34%) vaccinated residents had post-vaccination hepatitis B surface antibody levels ≥10 mIU/ml. There were no significant differences in vaccine response by age, gender, race, diabetes status, body mass index, or current smoking status. Our findings indicate that a low proportion of skilled nursing facility residents achieved a seroprotective response after hepatitis B vaccination."
669,0.004,4.0,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common opportunistic infection worldwide in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Intraabdominal TB includes lymphadenopathy and focal lesions of solid viscera. Symptomatic expression of tuberculous invasion of the pancreas (supplemented by demonstration of a mass on imaging) is rare among HIV-infected patients. We report the case of an HIV-infected patient with a tuberculous pancreatic abscess and review nine similar cases. All patients presented with persistent fever and abdominal pain. The diagnosis was made on the basis of detection of pancreatic mass lesions on computed tomographic (CT) scans and the results of cultures and/or acid-fast stains of peripancreatic abscess material and/or other body fluids. Despite an excellent response to antituberculous therapy, three patients died of unrelated causes. In the setting of a febrile illness with abdominal symptoms, tuberculous pancreatic abscess should be considered in the differential diagnosis for HIV-infected patients with a CT-identified mass lesion."
9590,0.004,4.0,"Antiretroviral (ARV) drug toxicities pose treatment challenges and contribute to poor adherence. This study was carried out to document the commonly reported adverse reactions caused by ARV drugs in HIV patients in Tanzania. Information on drug induced adverse reactions (ADRs) in patients using ARV drugs was collected from the databases maintained in HIV clinics of Dar es Salaam and Mbeya. A total of 7502 and 1234 records of patients under ARV therapy by December 2006 were analysed in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya, respectively. In May, 2008 a cross-sectional study was conducted in which, the association between nevirapine (NVP) plasma concentrations and skin rashes problems was determined in 50 patients put on NVP based HAART for less than 2 weeks. Determination of NVP plasma concentration was carried out using a validated HPLC method in which patients from Dar es Salaam were involved. The study revealed that, anaemia, liver toxicity, skin rash and peripheral neuropathy were the most reported ADRs. The NVP plasma level determination revealed that there was no difference between those who had experienced skin rashes and those who did not (mean of 6.05 and 5.5 microg/ml respectively). There was a slight increase in reported ADRs between 2005 and 2006. A total of 932 (12.4%) patients changed their regimen in Dar es Salaam between January 2005 and December, 2006. Similarly, a total of 542 (44%) patients in Mbeya changed their regimen during that period. It can be concluded that, in both Dar es Salaam and Mbeya patients developed ARV related ADRs which are similar to those reported elsewhere."
496,0.004,4.0,"Hospital charts were reviewed to ascertain the frequency with which patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) were being managed in accordance with current guidelines or recommendations in New York State for the calendar year 1993. Comparisons were made between hospitals that are designated by the New York State Department of Health as comprehensive treatment centers--designated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) centers--and all other hospitals. For patients who had been on PCP prophylaxis before admission, 34% had documentation of positive histologic evidence for PCP infection during the studied hospitalization period. Of all patients not on PCP prophylaxis at the time of admission, 94% had at least one of the diagnostic tests for PCP done during the PCP hospitalization. Eighty-one percent of all patients had either pulse oximetry or an arterial blood gas determination. Seventy-seven percent of all patients with a PO2 equal to or less than 70 mm Hg received steroids. All eligible patients received one of nine possible treatment combinations, which included either single drug therapy, multiple drug therapy, or participation in a clinical trial. Sixteen percent of eligible patients had no documentation of receiving PCP medication at discharge. Proportions receiving diagnostic or treatment interventions were usually higher in designated AIDS centers than in non-designated AIDS centers."
3183,0.004,4.0,"In 2004, KwaZulu-Natal initiated one of the world's largest HIV/AIDS treatment programs. Studies in South Africa have shown that patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) develop rapidly and transmit drug resistant mutations. Since resistance testing is not widely available in Kwazulu-Natal, the Department of Health conducted the first HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) threshold survey in 2005, which did not identify any mutations associated with HIVDR. The objective of this study was to conduct a follow-up threshold survey to update the information on HIVDR. This study was conducted in 2009 in five antenatal care sites in Kwazulu-Natal using the HIVDR threshold survey method developed by WHO. Two hundred and thirteen newly-diagnosed HIV positive, drug-naïve primigravidae, less than 22 years of age were included in the survey. Of the 82 HIV positive specimens, 17 had insufficient volume for genotyping and, of the remaining 65, 47 were genotyped sequentially. Drug resistance was identified by sequencing the HIV-1 pol gene, using the ViroSeq® HIV-1 genotyping system v2.0. Of the 47 samples that were genotyped, only one presented with a K103N mutation, which equates to a prevalence of transmitted HIVDR of <5%. The low prevalence of transmitted HIVDR is in keeping with statistical models of the early stages of ART rollout. As ART coverage is increasing continuously, there is a need to ensure that vigilance of HIVDR continues so that the emergence and spread of HIVDR is minimized."
4011,0.004,4.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains the most common risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Efficient suppression of HBV viremia and necroinflammation as a result of nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment is able to reduce HCC incidence; nevertheless, hepatocarcinogenesis can occur in the absence of active hepatitis, correlating with high HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) levels. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a central player in chronic inflammation and HCC development. However, in the absence of severe chronic inflammation, the role of NF-κB signaling in HCC development remains elusive. As a model of hepatocarcinogenesis driven by accumulation of HBV envelope polypeptides, HBsAg transgenic mice, which show no HBV-specific immune response, were crossed to animals with hepatocyte-specific inhibition of canonical NF-κB signaling. We detected prolonged, severe endoplasmic reticulum stress already at 20 weeks of age in NF-κB-deficient hepatocytes of HBsAg-expressing mice. The unfolded protein response regulator binding immunoglobulin protein/78-kDa glucose-regulated protein was down-regulated, activating transcription factor 6, and eIF2α were activated with subsequent overexpression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein. Notably, immune cell infiltrates and liver transaminases were unchanged. However, as a result of this increased cellular stress, insufficient hepatocyte proliferation due to G1 /S-phase cell cycle arrest with overexpression of p27 and emergence of ductular reactions was detected. This culminated in increased DNA damage already at 20 weeks of age and finally led to 100% HCC incidence due to NF-κB inhibition."
6689,0.004,4.0,"One of the hallmarks of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes which precedes the progression from an asymptomatic state to AIDS. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is one of the mechanisms proposed to mediate this depletion. Infectious and inactivated preparations of HIV-1LAI were compared for their potential to induce apoptosis. Analysis with fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the DNA intercalative compound propidium iodide demonstrated that apoptosis occurred only with infectious HIV-1, implying that cell surface binding and signalling by the virus alone were insufficient to trigger apoptosis. Apoptosis was further confirmed by the presence of characteristic digestion of host cell DNA and morphologically by nuclear condensation observed by transmission electron microscopy. HIV infection of CD4+ T cell lines generated an accumulation of the cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and cells undergoing apoptosis appeared to originate from the pool of cells in the G1 phase. Inhibitors of HIV replication were used to identify the point in the virus replicative cycle at which apoptosis is induced. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ddI, or the HIV protease inhibitor, RO31-8959 (Saquinavir), were added either 2 h before or 6 h after HIV inoculation. Only ddI inhibited HIV-induced apoptosis when added before inoculation; however, neither treatment was effective in preventing HIV-induced apoptosis when applied 6 h after inoculation. These data indicate that apoptosis requires a single round of reverse transcription and the expression of virion proteins, but not the maturation of progeny virions. Two agents which compete with HIV for binding to CD4+ T cells, dextran sulphate and the anti-CD4 MAb Leu3a, were effective at preventing apoptosis when added 6 h after infection, implying that a subsequent gp120-CD4 interaction at the surface of an infected cell was required to complete the apoptotic process."
4158,0.004,4.0,"Previous studies have implicated CXCL12 in the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection. Proteolysis of CXCL12 generates a neurotoxic molecule, CXCL12(5-67), which engages and activates CXCR3, in addition to exhibiting increased expression in the brains of patients with HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Herein, we investigated CXCR3-mediated neuronal injury, particularly, its contribution to autophagy suppression and the concomitant effects of antiretroviral therapy using human brain samples and models of HIV neuropathogenesis. Neurons in the brains of HAD patients and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected animals, as well as cultured human neurons, expressed CXCR3, which was modulated in a ligand-specific manner. Exposure of human neurons to CXCL12(5-67) caused a reduction in the autophagy-associated molecule LC3 (P<0.05) and neuronal survival (P<0.05), which recapitulated findings in FIV- and HIV-infected brains (P<0.05). Oral didanosine (ddI) treatment of FIV-infected animals reduced neurobehavioral abnormalities in conjunction with diminished plasma viral load (P<0.05). F4/80 transcript abundance and CXCL12(5-67) immunoreactivity were reduced with restored neuronal LC3 expression in the brains of FIV-infected animals after ddI treatment (P<0.05). ddI treatment also prevented microglial activation and depletion of synaptic proteins in the cortex of FIV-infected animals (P<0.05). These findings indicate that the beneficial effects of ddI might be a consequence of a reduced systemic viral burden and concurrent leukocyte activation, leading to diminished neuroinflammation with preservation of neuronal autophagy by regulating CXCR3 activation."
7166,0.004,4.0,"The aim of this study is to examine whether internalized AIDS stigma among HIV patients one year after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is associated with sociodemographic characteristics, health status, social support, quality of life (QoL), and ARV adherence. This is a prospective study of all treatment-naive patients (N=735) recruited from all three public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal and followed up at 6 and 12 months being on ART. Results indicated that despite a decrease in stigma seen in this study (may be due to ART) the level of stigma and discrimination remains high, and stigma reduction interventions are urgently needed in this population. CD4 cell counts significantly increased and HIV symptoms reduced significantly but depression symptoms remained high and even increased after 12 months on treatment. In multivariate analysis lower CD4 cell counts (odds ratio 0.5, 0.3-0.9), severe depression (5.6, 2.5-12.5) and low QoL (0.6, 0.5-0.8) were associated with internalized AIDS stigma. These findings may suggest that HIV care should include counseling and support that includes stigma concerns, depression, and QoL prior to and during the first year following diagnosis."
3741,0.004,4.0,"Liver cancer ranks sixth in cancer incidence, and is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, which arises from hepatocytes and accounts for approximately 70%-85% of cases. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) frequently causes liver inflammation, hepatic damage and subsequent cirrhosis. Integrated viral DNA is found in 85%-90% of HBV-related HCCs. Its presence in tumors from non-cirrhotic livers of children or young adults further supports the role of viral DNA integration in hepatocarcinogenesis. Integration of subgenomic HBV DNA fragments into different locations within the host DNA is a significant feature of chronic HBV infection. Integration has two potential consequences: (1) the host genome becomes altered (""cis"" effect); and (2) the HBV genome becomes altered (""trans"" effect). The cis effect includes insertional mutagenesis, which can potentially disrupt host gene function or alter host gene regulation. Tumor progression is frequently associated with rearrangement and partial gain or loss of both viral and host sequences. However, the role of integrated HBV DNA in hepatocarcinogenesis remains controversial. Modern technology has provided a new paradigm to further our understanding of disease mechanisms. This review summarizes the role of HBV DNA integration in human carcinogenesis."
4921,0.004,4.0,"The antiretroviral drug combination emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF/FTC) taken as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV infection, yet it also requires adherence and potentially decreases condom use. This study sought to examine these issues among a key population at risk of HIV infection, substance-using men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted semi-structured interviews with an ethnically diverse sample of 30 young (aged 20-35) MSM prescribed PrEP within a large integrated healthcare system in San Francisco, who had reported recent drug use or hazardous drinking and one or more missed doses of PrEP. We explored participants' risk perception and sexual risk behavior, drug and alcohol use, and PrEP adherence in the context of substance use. Interviews were transcribed and coded using a directed content analysis approach to identify key categories and commonalities, and differences across participants. Salient subcategories included positive psychological effects of being on PrEP (e.g., decreased anxiety, feelings of empowerment), social effects (e.g., reduced HIV stigma), and reduction in overall perceptions of HIV risk. While overall reported use of condoms went down and many reported a brief period of increased condomless sex following PrEP initiation, others continued condom use with most of their sexual partners. Contextual factors influencing their decision to engage in condomless sex included how well they knew the partner and whether the partner was on PrEP or HIV antiretroviral treatment. Factors associated with poor adherence included disruptions in daily routine and use of alcohol and methamphetamine. PrEP-prescribing clinicians should support their patients in making informed decisions about condom use and identifying strategies to maximize adherence in the context of substance use."
1560,0.004,4.0,"Clinically significant methemoglobinemia can develop as a result of medications. Although dapsone and primaquine are known to produce methemoglobinemia in susceptible individuals, methemoglobinemia has been reported only rarely in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population. We describe five cases of methemoglobinemia caused by either primaquine or dapsone alone or in combination. The initial methemoglobin level ranged from 15.3% in the patient whose methemoglobinemia was caused by primaquine alone to 33.1%. Five patients developed symptomatic methemoglobinemia requiring hospitalization for 1 to 12 days. Two cases resulted from intentional overdoses of dapsone, and three developed within several days of commencing primaquine while dapsone remained present in the bloodstream. The four severe cases required intravenous methylene blue, supplemental oxygen, plus erythrocyte transfusions, whereas the mild case responded to oxygen therapy plus discontinuation of the precipitating drugs. Blood gases and pulse oximetry do not aid in the diagnosis, which requires cooximetry. Our study indicates that dapsone and primaquine alone or in combination can produce clinically significant methemoglobinemia in HIV-infected individuals, either in the setting of an overdose or when primaquine is instituted before dapsone has been cleared from the bloodstream."
5703,0.004,4.0,"With ongoing earlier enrollment on and rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cameroon, there are increasing risks of transmitted HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) at population levels. We, therefore, evaluated the threshold of HIVDR in a population initiating ART, to inform on the effectiveness of first-line regimens, considering HIV-1 diversity, plasma viral load (PVL), and CD4-based disease progression. A total of 53 adults [median (interquartile range, IQR) CD4: 162 cell/mm(3) (48-284); median (IQR) PVL: 5.34 log10 RNA (4.17-6.42) copies/ml] initiating ART in 2014 at the Yaoundé Central Hospital were enrolled for HIV-1 protease-reverse transcriptase sequencing. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were interpreted using the 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) list versus the Stanford HIVdb algorithm version 7.0. Level of DRMs was low (3.77%) versus moderate (7.55%), respectively, following the WHO list (T69D, K103N) versus Stanford HIVdb (T69D, A98G, K103N, K238T), respectively. Prevailing clade was CRF02_AG (71.70%). Based on Stanford HIVdb, a slightly higher proportion of patients with DRMs were found among ones infected with CRF02_AG than in those non-CRF02_AG infected (7.89% vs. 6.67%, p = 1.000), with lower PVL (7.69% <5.5 vs. 0% ≥5.5 log10 RNA copies/ml, p = .488) and with higher CD4 counts (9.52% CD4 ≥200 vs. 3.33% CD4 <200 cells/mm(3), p = .749). Thresholds of DRMs suggest that standard first-line regimens currently used in Cameroon may remain effective at population levels, despite scale-up of ART in the country, pending adherence, and closed virological monitoring. With an intent-to-diagnose approach, the discrepant levels of DRMs support using Stanford HIVdb to evaluate initial ART, while revising the WHO list for surveillance."
1622,0.004,4.0,"In sub-Saharan Africa, the Pacific, and particularly Asia, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly endemic, the most common route of transmission is perinatal. To minimize the number of horizontal transmissions, we determined the prevalence of HBV genotypes among children in northern Thailand. From a survey of 1,231 schoolchildren in Chiang Mai during 1998 to 2000, 55 (4.5%) were found positive for HBsAg. Fifty-three HBsAg-positive samples were available for this study. These came from 28 girls (52.8%) and 25 boys (47.2%), age 5-16 years, with a mean age of 12.8 (+/-2.6) years. The laboratory method was based on a multiplex-PCR for the detection of 6 HBV genotypes (A-F). Among 53 HBsAg positive cases, 48 (90.6%) were genotype C, followed by 4 cases of genotype B (7.5%), and 1 case (1.9%) with mixed infection with genotypes B and C. The high prevalence of HBV genotype C follow by genotype B is similar to that found among blood donors in northern Thailand and the nationwide epidemiological survey conducted in 2004. Perinatal transmission may play an important role in the spread of the virus in this area, as in other Asian countries, where genotypes C and B are highly prevalent."
464,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem, with more than 350 million people chronically infected worldwide. The chronic HBV infection in Poland is also an essential medical and social problem. Starting from 1993, a steady decline of the incidence of HBV has been observed, reaching the estimated rate of 4.5 per 100 000 in 2004. Nothing is known about the genetic variability of HBV in Poland, the occurrence and spreading of genetic variants and mutants of hepatitis B virus in the population of Polish patients during the course of the disease and in relation to antiviral treatment. It is very interesting to study the molecular epidemiology of the Polish population regarding hepatitis B virus infection as Poland is still ethnically a uniform country, with no more than 3-4% of ethnic minorities. The first results regarding distribution of HBV genotypes and serotypes in northern Poland have been published by our group in 2003 and 2004. This work was part of a scientific project supported by the Fifth Framework Programme initiative of the European Union, entitled ""Emerging variants of hepatitis B virus: new tools for epidemiological survey, diagnosis of infection, and monitoring of drug resistance"". In the course of the project more than 200 hepatitis B infected patients from the northern part of Poland have been enrolled, diagnosed and - if the viral load of HBV was suitable for analysis - genotyped by sequencing of the HBV pol/S gene fragment. This review presents the main characteristics and some interesting aspects of the studied cohort of chronically infected patients from northern Poland as well as the molecular epidemiology."

Between 1985, when most patients were tested for HIV infection, and 1993 3 possibly HIV-related suicides were reported to Haemophilia Centre Directors. It is argued that haemophilia comprehensive care may contribute to reducing some of the factors associated with suicide risk, and thus be a reason for this low incidence. It is suggested that the pattern of health care delivery developed for the haemophilia community might serve as a template for those treating others with HIV infection."
9867,0.004,4.0,"Medicaid is rapidly moving toward managed care throughout the United States and will have a major impact on care programs for those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The experience at the Johns Hopkins HIV Care Service is an example of the transition from fee-for-service to managed care. The Maryland Medicaid program, which has required enrollment of all Medicaid recipients since June 1997, uses an adjusted payment rate and separately funds protease inhibitors. Elements that made the transition to a managed care organization possible included the early development of a comprehensive network of services and a database showing that historical Medicaid payments were low compared with the statewide experience. Our Medicaid managed care program promotes unlimited access to specialists, rejects the ""gatekeeper"" concept for any service, and includes an open formulary. Nevertheless, it is uncertain that the services now provided can be sustained with anticipated reductions in payments that seem inevitable with Medicaid policies here and nationally."
4758,0.004,4.0,"The effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the treatment of HIV infection is usually measured by survival, CD4 lymphocyte counts, HIV-1 RNA viral load testing, and the occurrence of opportunistic infections. This pilot study sought to measure the impact of HAART treatments on a wide range of clinical outcomes and psychological variables in a sample of patients with advanced HIV infection. Seventy patients with advanced AIDS who were protease inhibitor naïve were started on HAART regimens. Patients were admitted to an AIDS inpatient unit of a long-term care facility that provides treatment and palliative care. All patients were diagnosed with AIDS, had CD4 cell counts below 300/cc(3), and had a projected survival of greater than one month. Patients were started on triple-drug HAART regimens with daily medical supervision and observation. In addition to standard clinical and laboratory markers, a series of observer-rated and self-report instruments were used to measure various physical and psychological factors (e.g., pain and symptom distress, psychological well-being, depression). Data were collected at baseline and after 1 and 3 months of HAART therapy. As expected, the CD4 count increased and viral load levels decreased significantly over the 3-month study period. In addition, patients improved significantly in body weight, and serum albumin and ferritin levels. The only psychosocial measure that improved significantly with treatment was depression. Ratings of pain intensity, physical and psychological symptom distress, and overall quality of life did not change. Of the 70 patients studied, 84.3% were still alive after the 3-month study period. Of these, 6 (8.6%) were discharged to community. However, 17 surviving patients (24.3%) had HAART regimens discontinued due to drug intolerance and 11 patients (15.7%) expired during the study period. While these data are preliminary, HAART regimens appear to have positive effects on CD4 count, HIV viral load, and several other measures of physical well-being in patients with advanced AIDS. Despite these improvements, the benefits of treatment on pain and symptom distress, and psychological well-being were less clear. In addition, treatment failure (mortality and intolerance) were not uncommon in this sample (40%). Further research is clearly necessary to better understand the benefits of HAART therapy in patients with advanced HIV infection."
7791,0.004,4.0,"Depletion of CD4+ T cells is one of the hallmarks of progression of HIV-1 infection. However, measurement of the CD4+ T-cell count is expensive and often unavailable in less developed areas. Previous studies have suggested that the total lymphocyte count (TLC) can be used to predict a low absolute CD4+ T-cell count. To determine the relationship between TLC and CD4+ T-cell count in HIV-1-infected South African patients, 2777 HIV-1-seropositive patients visiting the Immunology clinic at the Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein, South Africa from April 1991 to April 1997 were included in the study. In total, 3237 observations were used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, of various cutpoints of the TLC to predict an absolute CD4+ T-cell count of <200 cells/mm3, CD4+ percentage <20%, and CD4+ percentage <15%. Spearman rank correlations were calculated between TLC and CD4+ T cells, CD4+ percentage and CD8+ T cells, as well as between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Results demonstrated that a TLC of 2 x 10(9)/L or less had a sensitivity of 90.3% to detect patients with a CD4+ T-cell count of <200 cells/mm3, but a specificity of only 53.7%. When the TLC cutoff value was lowered, specificity increased but sensitivity decreased. For the observations as a group, a correlation (r = 0.704) between CD4+ T-cell count and TLC was demonstrated, but if the patients were divided into three groups according to their CD4+ T-cell count, this correlation weakened considerably. Therefore, although TLC shows a correlation with CD4+ T-cell count, it is not a good predictor of the CD4+ T-cell count in this population and should preferably not be used in the clinical care of HIV/AIDS patients."
1888,0.004,4.0,"The regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection and replication in primary monocytes was investigated by mutagenesis of recombinant proviral clones containing an env determinant required for the infectivity of monocytes. Virus replication was assayed by determination of reverse transcriptase activity in culture fluids and by recovery of virus from monocytes following cocultivation with uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Three virus replication phenotypes were observed in monocytes: productive infection, silent infection, and no infection. Incorporation of the monocytetropic env determinant in a full-length clone incapable of infection or replication in primary monocytes (no infection) conferred the capacity for highly efficient virus replication in monocytes (productive infection). Clones with the env determinant but lacking either functional vpr or vpu genes generated lower replication levels in monocytes. Mutation of both vpr and vpu, however, resulted in nearly complete attenuation of virus replication in monocytes, despite subsequent virus recovery from infected monocytes by cocultivation with uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (silent infection). These findings indicate a central role for the ""accessory"" genes vpu and vpr in productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in monocytes and indicate that vpu and vpr may be capable of functional complementation."
71,0.004,4.0,"The prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is currently about 35% among injecting drug users in Budapest, Hungary, and it is under 20% outside of the capital, and no verified case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been detected so far. Mathematical models describe that the co-occurrence of HIV and HCV among injecting drug users is such under an HCV prevalence of about 35% the probability of an HIV epidemic is low, but above this threshold an, HIV epidemic is to be expected. According to these models, there is a looming probability of an HIV epidemic among injecting drug users in Hungary, especially in Budapest. There are four ways to prevent or delay such an epidemic: 1. substitution treatment programs; 2. legal access to injecting equipment; 3. free and confidential HIV and HCV counseling and rapid testing; and 4. hygienic injecting environment. In order to avoid a predicted HIV epidemic, epidemiological pattern of HCV among injecting drug users in Hungary requires both a comprehensive prevention response and the systematic monitoring of the epidemiological situation. The success of the prevention programs depends on two factors: 1. wide access; and 2. regular financial support from the government."
8860,0.004,4.0,"Increased access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by human immunodeficiency virus postive (HIV⁺) individuals has become a reality worldwide. In Brazil, HAART currently reaches over half of HIV-infected subjects. In the context of a remarkable HIV-1 genetic variability, highly related variants, called quasispecies, are generated. HIV quasispecies generated during infection can influence virus persistence and pathogenicity, representing a challenge to treatment. However, the clinical relevance of minority quasispecies is still uncertain. In this study, we have determined the archived proviral sequences, viral subtype and drug resistance mutations from a cohort of HIV⁺ patients with undetectable viral load undergoing HAART as first-line therapy using next-generation sequencing for near full-length virus genome (NFLG) assembly. HIV-1 consensus sequences representing NFLG were obtained for eleven patients, while for another twelve varying genome coverage rates were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed the predominance of subtype B (83%; 19/23). Considering the minority variants, 18 patients carried archived virus harboring at least one mutation conferring antiretroviral resistance; for six patients, the mutations correlated with the current ARVs used. These data highlight the importance of monitoring HIV minority drug resistant variants and their clinical impact, to guide future regimen switches and improve HIV treatment success."
4258,0.004,4.0,"The aim of this study performed in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, was to describe the distribution of CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes (CD4) in HIV-1-infected (HIV+) pregnant women diagnosed during prenatal voluntary counseling and testing and to assess whether HIV-related immunodeficiency influenced the acceptance of an antiretroviral (ARV) package (zidovudine beginning at 36 weeks of amenorrhea plus intrapartum nevirapine) to prevent mother-to-child transmission. Between April and June 2002, a CD4 count was systematically performed in all HIV+ women (n=221) in 5 antenatal clinics carrying out voluntary counseling and testing. No difference in CD4 count was found in HIV+ women who did not return for their test result (n=50) and those who were informed of their positive serostatus (n=171) (median CD4 count: 389/mm3 vs. 420/mm3; P=0.19). We also found a lack of difference in CD4 count in those who accepted ARV (n=72) and those who did not but knew their HIV status (n=99) (median CD4 count: 405/mm3 vs. 425/mm3; P=0.47). The overall uptake of the intervention (31.9%) appeared to be independent of the maternal immune status."
1793,0.004,4.0,"Hematologic manifestations in perinatally human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected children have not been widely described in literature. Knowledge of the spontaneous evolution of this disease is essential for achieving optimum care of patients. We analyzed the main hematologic manifestations developed in the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy period of 1217 children, collected from the Italian Register for HIV infection. In 111 patients, the hematologic sign was the first clinical manifestation. Among anemic and neutropenic patients, the fraction of patients in clinical class C was significantly higher than the corresponding fraction in class B (76%, P<0.001 and 74%, P<0.01), and significantly lower in thrombocytopenic patients (42%, P<0.001). The overall progression from class B to C was overlapping to the control group; when separated, however, anemic patients progressed faster (P<0.0001), whereas thrombocytopenic patients had a slower progression, similar to the nonhematologic patients in class A. Anemic patients had a worse prognosis than the control group (P<0.0001), similar to the nonhematologic patients in class C. Finally, the negative prognostic value of anemia was independent from the immunologic condition. Anemia was associated with greater mortality risks. Thrombocytopenia appeared, paradoxically, to be a positive prognostic factor within class B. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification presently defines hematologic patients as a single entity; a finer distinction could improve its relevance for the rational design of prevention and therapy."

Major problems facing surgeons will be how and when to provide appropriate care for AIDS patients, and protection of themselves and all health care personnel from occupational infection by the highly lethal HIV. Strict adherence to guidelines to prevent such occupational infection is paramount, and these should be observed in all patients, since it is impossible to always identify patients who are infectious. A sound understanding of the clinical problem and attention to this evolving epidemic are also essential for surgeons and all other health care personnel. With respect to society in general, control of AIDS and HIV can only be achieved by a joint effort of education, individual responsibility, and a coordinated governmental commitment to the problem."

9989,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global public health challenge, with an estimated 1.4 million patients worldwide. Co-infection with HIV leads to challenges in both the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Further, there has been an increase in rates of drug resistant tuberculosis, including multi-drug (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDRTB), which are difficult to treat and contribute to increased mortality. Because of the poor performance of sputum smear microscopy in HIV-infected patients, newer diagnostic tests are urgently required that are not only sensitive and specific but easy to use in remote and resource-constrained settings. The treatment of co-infected patients requires antituberculosis and antiretroviral drugs to be administered concomitantly; challenges include pill burden and patient compliance, drug interactions, overlapping toxic effects, and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Also important questions about the duration and schedule of anti-TB drug regimens and timing of antiretroviral therapy remain unanswered. From a programmatic point of view, screening of all HIV-infected persons for TB and vice-versa requires good co-ordination and communication between the TB and AIDS control programmes. Linkage of co-infected patients to antiretroviral treatment centres is critical if early mortality is to be prevented. We present here an overview of existing diagnostic strategies, new tests in the pipeline and recommendations for treatment of patients with HIV-TB dual infection."
6574,0.004,4.0,"HIV and poor mental health are intricately related. In settings of poverty, both are often rooted in structural factors related to material and social deprivation. We performed a qualitative analysis to understand factors contributing to poor emotional health and its impact among impoverished Peruvian HIV-infected individuals. We conducted focus group discussions with patients and providers consisting of semistructured, open-ended questions. Qualitative analysis provided insight into the profound impact of depression, isolation, stigma, and lack of social support among these patients. Living with HIV contributed significantly to mental health problems experienced by HIV-positive individuals; furthermore, long-standing stressors-such as economic hardship, fragmented family relationships, and substance use-shaped patients' outlooks, and may have contributed not only to current emotional hardship but to risk factors for contracting HIV as well. Once diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, many patients experienced hopelessness, stigma, and socioeconomic marginalization. Patients tended to rely on informal sources of support, including peers and community health workers, and rarely used formal mental health services. In resource-poor settings, the context of mental health problems among HIV-positive individuals must be framed within the larger structural context of poverty and social exclusion. Optimal strategies to address the mental health problems of these individuals should include integrating mental health services into HIV care, task shifting to utilize community health workers where human resources are scarce, and interventions aimed at poverty alleviation."
6473,0.004,4.0,"Starting from the observation that a number of consecutive patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) resulted positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies on routine testing, we set up a survey for HCV contact prevalence in all patients with lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) followed in our institution. We searched for HCV antibodies by a third-generation ELISA technique, followed by a confirmation test (RIBA III); serum viral RNA and HCV genotype were investigated by a RT-PCR technique. We screened a total of 315 patients suffering from B-NHL (91), multiple myeloma (56), MGUS (48), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (57), Waldentrom's macroglobulinemia (13), Hodgkin's disease (HD)(43), and T-NHL (9). While only 1 of 52 patients with a non-B-LPD (HD or T-NHL) had signs of HCV contact (i.e., 1.9%, which is in the range of the normal population in the South of Italy), 59 of 263 patients with a B-LPD (22.4%) had HCV antibodies or RNA, or both, with no major differences among the various types of disorders, except for WM, in which the rate was higher (61.5%). The same prevalence was found for patients tested at diagnosis or during the follow-up, and in transfused or never-transfused patients. Only a few patients were aware of having a liver disease; one-half of HCV-positive patients never had transaminase increase. A review of data from Central and Northern Italy is included, showing similar findings; a report from Japan has confirmed such an association, while limited surveys in England have not revealed any correlation. These findings may have important biological and clinical implications."
7032,0.004,4.0,"Nucleoside analog-based regimens remain an integral component of combination therapy for use in both antiretroviral treatment-naive and experienced HIV-infected patients. To further define treatment responses to new antiretroviral therapy in patients with long-term experience to dual nucleoside analog therapy (zidovudine [ZDV] plus didanosine [ddI] or ZDV plus zalcitabine [ddC]), 325 subjects derived from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 175 trial were randomized to three different combination regimens: (1) continuation of ZDV + ddI or ZDV + ddC (continuation arm), (2) addition of 3TC to ZDV + ddI or ZDV + ddC (addition arm), or (3) a switch to ZDV + 3TC therapy (switch arm). Both the addition and switch arms sustained significantly greater short-term (baseline to week 4) mean CD4+ cell count increases compared with the continuation arm (+36, +28 versus -4 cells/mm3; p = 0.012) and long-term CD4+ cell count responses (baseline to weeks 40/48: +32, +19 versus -9 cells/mm3; p = 0.003). Superior short-term (baseline to week 8) mean decreases in plasma HIV RNA (p < 0.001) were achieved by both the addition and switch arms (0.53 log10 and 0.54 log10 copies/ml, respectively) compared with the continuation arm (0.13 copies/ml) whereas no differences in long-term virologic suppression were observed (p = 0.30). At week 48, no differences were observed in the proportions of subjects who had HIV RNA levels below 500 copies/mL: 18% of subjects in each treatment arm (3-way p = 1.0). Overall, the treatments were well tolerated and only nine subjects (3%) died or developed one or more AIDS-defining events. While this study confirms the intrinsic antiretroviral activity of 3TC, only modest marker changes and limited short-term viral suppression are seen with incremental addition of the drug. The current approach of using 3TC in maximally suppressive regimens is preferred."

GP73 was evaluated as a biomarker of HIV progression and AIDS treatment efficacy. Forty-eight HIV patients (≤ 350 CD4 + T cells/μL) undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART group) and 18 HIV patients expected to undergo HAART within 9 months (>350 CD4 + T cells/μL) (control group) were enrolled in a prospective, single center, cohort study from May 2009 to Jun 2012. Blood aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cholesterol, triglycerides, and total bilirubin were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (HAART group) or 3 month intervals (control group). Serum HIV RNA level (viral load) was determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) GP73 concentration were determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay kit and western blot, respectively. Significant positive and negative correlations in baseline serum GP73 concentration and HIV viral load (r = 0.39, P < 0.001) and CD4 + T cell count (r = -0.501, P < 0.001) were observed, respectively. In receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.79 (95 % CI 0.66-0.92). The sensitivity and specificity of GP73 for correct identification of patients with ≤350 CD4 + T cells/μL were 76.09 and 75.0 %, respectively, with an ROC-derived cut-off of 100.6 ng/mL. For HIV patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy, GP73 may be a potential biomarker treatment efficacy useful in AIDS management."
6790,0.004,4.0,"There is little information on infections caused by larval cestodes in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in developed countries. Two infections by larval cestodes were found in 714 HIV-infected patients studied from 1998 to 2004 at the Hospital General Universitario de Elche in Spain (Mediterranean Coast). The first patient was a Colombian immigrant diagnosed as having neurocysticercosis, and subsequently found to have HIV infection. The second case was an HIV-infected Spanish patient who developed hydatid disease of the liver, lung and peritoneum. Both patients died. Although infrequent, infections by larval cestodes constitute a cause of disease in HIV-infected patients in developed countries, and might be linked with a more severe presentation."
9217,0.004,4.0,"Indinavir is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with HIV infection. Combination antiretroviral therapy with indinavir plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is associated with greater reductions in viral load, greater increases in CD4+ cell counts, and reduced morbidity and mortality when compared with 2 NRTIs alone. In the landmark clinical trial ACTG 320, the rate of progression to AIDS or death (primary end-point) among zidovudine-experienced patients treated with indinavir, zidovudine and lamivudine was approximately half that of patients who received only zidovudine plus lamivudine (6 vs 11%; p < 0.001). The durability of an indinavir-containing regimen was demonstrated in Merck protocol 035, an ongoing trial in which a significant proportion of patients had sustained viral suppression for up to 3 years. Merck protocol 039, also an ongoing trial, showed a greater effect on surrogate markers of HIV disease progression with indinavir-based triple therapy than with zidovudine plus lamivudine or indinavir monotherapy in patients with advanced disease (median baseline CD4+ count 15 cells/microL). Numerous additional clinical trials have established the beneficial antiviral and immunological effects of indinavir in both antiretroviral-naive and -experienced patients with HIV infection. Indinavir is associated with various drug class-related adverse events, including gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. nausea, diarrhoea), headache and asthenia/fatigue. A lipodystrophy syndrome has been commonly reported with indinavir and other protease inhibitors combined with NRTIs, but it has also been reported in many protease inhibitor-naive patients, and a definitive causal link has not been established between the syndrome and protease inhibitors. Nephrolithiasis may develop in about 9% of patients receiving indinavir but does not appear to be associated with other protease inhibitors; <0.5% of patients receiving indinavir discontinue the drug because of nephrolithiasis, which may be the extreme end of a continuum of crystal-related renal syndromes. Additional renal problems (e.g. nephropathy) have been reported in small numbers of patients receiving indinavir. In summary, indinavir is a protease inhibitor with well documented efficacy when used as part of combined therapy in patients with HIV infection. Both US and UK treatment guidelines continue to recommend protease inhibitor-based regimens including indinavir as a first-line option. Indinavir is being studied as a twice daily and once daily regimen with a low dosage of ritonavir as a way to alleviate tolerability, drug interaction and patient compliance/adherence issues. Indinavir-containing triple therapy has demonstrated positive effects not only on surrogate markers of disease progression, but also on clinical end-points of mortality and morbidity in patients with HIV disease. Protease inhibitors are a significant advance in the care of patients with HIV infection, and, in an era of evidence-based medicine, indinavir represents an important component of antiretroviral treatment strategies."
9344,0.004,4.0,"Nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors, including zidovudine, didanosine, and zalcitabine, remain the cornerstone of therapy against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the cause of AIDS. Although therapeutic regimens have been designed that are effective in slowing the progression of disease, therapy with these agents has not been optimized. Ultimately, therapy is destined to fail in most patients. Decisions regarding when to begin therapy and the course of action to take when failure of therapy occurs are largely in the hands of the patient's physician, and currently must be made without the support of conclusive clinical data. In addition to an understanding of the recommended dosing guidelines, proper management of AIDS therapy requires a fundamental knowledge of the disease process, the pharmacology and limitations of the agents employed against the virus, and close cooperation with the clinical laboratory. Therefore, this article reviews the pharmacology of the three drugs currently approved for treatment of HIV infection, and the current guidelines for their use. The article also reviews the clinical and laboratory management of these agents, including the use of surrogate markers and the potential for pharmacokinetic optimization of therapy."
3335,0.004,4.0,"To examine the genetic features of the long terminal repeat (LTR) derived from six HIV-1-infected individuals enrolled in the Mexico City Cohort, we cloned and sequenced a 505-bp fragment of the proviral LTR from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All patients harbored HIV-1 LTR quasispecies corresponding to the B subtype. Three patients with high CD4+ T cell counts (>500/mm3) presented LTR sequences with point mutations in the TAR bulge. The LTR sequence from a patient classified as a long-term nonprogressor (LTNP) presented the most frequent naturally occurring length polymorphism (MFNLP) and two substitutions in the TAR region that were predicted to result in two alternative secondary RNA structures. A novel 18-bp deletion, which eliminates part of the putative binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT-1), was identified in the overlapping nef/LTR sequence derived from a patient progressing to AIDS. This deletion coincides with the ability of this virus to consistently replicate at low levels in vivo (viral load <500 RNA copies/ml) and in vitro (unsuccessful virus isolation). On one occasion, when virus isolation was successful, the 18-bp deletion was no longer evident and LTR sequences with intact NFAT-1-binding sites were observed. Inoculation of hu-PBL-SCID mice with viruses from several Mexican patients resulted in differential CD4+ T cell depletion patterns 15 days postinfection, which agree with the in vivo CD4+ T cell count data from each patient."
7793,0.004,4.0,"Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend early initiation of HIV positive patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) irrespective of their clinical or immunological status known as the test and start approach. Lesotho, like many other countries introduced this approach in 2016 as a strategy to reach epidemic control. There will be rapidly growing number of HIV-infected individuals initiating treatment leading to practical challenges on health systems such as congestion, long waiting time for patients and limited time to provide quality services to patients. Differentiated models of ART delivery is an innovative solution that helps to increase access to care, while reducing the burden on existing health systems. Ultimately this model will help to achieve retention and viral suppression. We describe a demonstration study designed to evaluate a community-based differentiated model of multi-month dispensing (MMD) approaches of ART among stable HIV patients in Lesotho."
7711,0.004,4.0,"The Early Intervention Program (EIP) is California's publicly funded human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care and treatment program with 30 sites throughout the state. Our objective for this study was to examine the number of days from first HIV-positive result until enrollment into EIP by race/ethnicity, behavioral risk, and other characteristics, with data from clients who enrolled in an EIP site after the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapies. For Model I, logistic regression distinguished clients diagnosed with HIV and enrolled in EIP on the same day (0 days) from those with values of 1+ days; linear regression was then used on the log transformation of days for the majority of clients not diagnosed and enrolled on the same day. For Model II, logistic regression was used to identify client characteristics related to enrollment in EIP over 6 weeks from the date of HIV diagnosis. We found that Latinos were more likely than whites to enroll in EIP on the day they were diagnosed with HIV. For clients not diagnosed and enrolled in EIP on the same day, no differences across racial and ethnic groups were found for days until enrollment in HIV care and treatment. However, clients with a history of injection drug use took longer from the day they were diagnosed with HIV to enroll in EIP. The California EIP represents a model for programs seeking equity in access to HIV care and treatment across racial and ethnic groups. Getting injectors into timely HIV care and treatment represents a challenge."
3529,0.004,4.0,"Prior to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-infected patients were usually not considered as transplant candidates because of the poor prognosis of their underlying disease and concerns regarding the potential detrimental effects of immunosuppression on viral load and immune status. However, with the significant HAART-associated improvements in morbidity and mortality, good short-term outcomes after liver and kidney transplantation for patients with HIV infection have been reported. Nevertheless, HIV infection is currently considered a contraindication to lung transplantation in most transplant centers worldwide. The results of a double lung transplant performed in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and end-stage respiratory failure (ESRF) are presented after a 2-year follow-up. Approval of and recommendations for the management of this patient were obtained from the Italian National Center for Transplantation as an extension of the ongoing Italian protocol for liver and kidney transplantation in HIV-infected individuals. The operation was successful and the patient recovered rapidly after surgery. A cautious infectious and immunosuppressive management allowed so far the avoidance of major infectious complications and rejection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of lung transplantation in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient."
8478,0.004,4.0,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of sociodemographic characteristics, patient perceptions, and patient characteristics including spirituality, self-reported adherence, and highly active antiretroviral therapy. The convenience sample consisted of 120 English-speaking adults (60% male, 35% female, 5% transgendered) with HIV/AIDS from two HIV service agencies in a large metropolitan city in the southeastern United States. The mean self-reported adherence was 83.1% (SD = 15.7%). Adherence was significantly correlated with perceived support and absence of barriers, strong intentions to adhere, perceived effectiveness of the medications, higher levels of perceived general health, fewer years of HIV disease, and fewer years on antiretroviral medications. Existential well-being (e.g., viewing life as positive and having meaning) was a weak significant correlate. Backward regression analysis was conducted to identify a parsimonious model of predictors of adherence. The final model included presence of support and absence of barriers, fewer years of HIV infection, no current alcohol use, perceived severity of HIV, existential well-being, and male gender. This model explained 19.4% of the variance in adherence (observed F[6, 100] = 5.6, p < .0001)."
274,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Tat, a nuclear transactivator of viral gene expression, has the unusual property of being released by infected cells. Recent studies suggest that extracellular Tat is partially sequestered by heparan sulfate proteoglycans. As a consequence, Tat is concentrated on the cell surface and protected from proteolytic degradation, thus remaining in a biologically active form. We show that Tat binds the surfaces of both HIV-1-infected and surrounding uninfected cells. We provide evidence for a specific interaction between Tat and the HIV-1 glycoprotein 120 (gp120) envelope protein, which enhances virus attachment and entry into cells. We map the interacting sites of both Tat and gp120 and show that synthetic peptides mimicking the gp120 site inhibit HIV-1 infection. Our data demonstrate that membrane-associated Tat is a novel modulator of virus entry and suggest that the Tat-gp120 interaction represents a critical step in HIV-1 spreading during the course of infection."

2608,0.004,4.0,"Both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are important global public health problems with shared transmission routes. Although HIV/HCV coinfection is not uncommon, the prevalence rates vary significantly across different studies and regions. In Taiwan, injection drug users have become the major contributors to the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 2005. Because the prevalence of HCV infection is high in injection drug users, this HIV epidemic is also associated with a significant increase of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan. To control Taiwan's HIV epidemic, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) launched a harm-reduction program in 2006. The HIV epidemic, the percentage attributed to injection drug users, and the prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection gradually declined thereafter. In this article, we aimed to thoroughly examine the current literatures of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan and hope to provide a better understanding of the needs for the management of this coinfection. We conducted a narrative review and searched for literature from PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library database untill August 2015. Studies relevant to the epidemiology and associated risk factors of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan were examined and discussed."

We reviewed 1510 records of patients treated for active TB at the Public Health - Seattle & King County Tuberculosis Control Program between 2000 and 2010, and identified 53 with HCI. Advanced age, being born in the USA, HIV infection, homelessness and injection drug use were independently associated with HCI in TB cases. Independent factors associated with increased treatment duration included HIV infection, excess alcohol use, extrapulmonary TB, and any drug-resistant TB disease. Our findings suggest that TB-HCI patients can be successfully treated for active TB without extending treatment duration."

Children under 10 years with cerebral malaria and/or severe malarial anaemia, were compared with children with symptomatic, mild malaria, and controls of the same age and ethnicity. Adult TB cases with smear-positive pulmonary TB were compared with healthy blood donors from the same ethnic groups. Malaria cases and controls were tested for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and surface antigen (HBsAg). TB patients were tested for HIV antibodies. Genotyping used sequence-specific oligonucleotide analysis to identify MBP variant alleles. Overall, 46% (944/2041) of patients and controls were homozygous for the wild-type MBP allele, 45% (922/2041) were carriers of a single variant allele and 8.6% (175/2041) had two variant alleles. Neither homozygotes nor heterozygotes for MBP variants were at increased risk of clinical malaria, persistent HBV carriage or TB. The most common mutation in Africans, the codon 57 variant allele, was weakly associated with resistance to TB (221/794 in TB cases and 276/844 in controls, p = 0.037). MBP deficiency is not a significant risk factor for persistent HBV, severe malaria nor pulmonary TB in West Africa."

Liver function tests and viral markers were monitored monthly. Liver biopsy was requested whenever the alanine transaminase (ALT) was persistently abnormal. Eighty-six HBV carriers who were not given anti-TB drugs were chosen as a second control and evaluated prospectively. The incidence of liver dysfunction was significantly higher in HBV carriers given anti-TB drugs (34.9%) when compared to noncarriers (9.4%, P <.001) and with HBV carriers not given anti-TB drugs (8.1%, P <.001). For patients given anti-TB drugs, HBV carriers who developed liver dysfunction were younger (P =.011) and had more severe liver injury compared with noncarriers (P =.008). By multiple logistic regression analysis, age (P =.002) and hepatitis B infection (P <.001) were the only 2 significant risk factors for hepatotoxicity related to anti-TB therapy."
335,0.004,4.0,"Since the use of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) for HIV infection, there have been increasing reports of systemic manifestations of immune restoration. This new clinical syndrome among HIV-infected patients is associated with underlying co-infections with mycobacteria, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B and C infections, etc.... We report on an HIV/tuberculosis (TB) co-infected patient who developed an immune restoration inflammatory syndrome after initiation of HAART and anti-TB treatment. She developed fever, large abscesses and pleural and peritoneal effusions. Systemic symptoms decreased during corticosteroid treatment, but abscesses only disappeared 8 months after the start of the anti-TB treatment."
1312,0.004,4.0,"As health-care services in Nigeria and other African countries are becoming overstrained with patients, home-based care has increasingly been touted as a possible solution. The faith-based organisation, Gospel Health and Development Services, provides a home-based care programme for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) residing in Plateau State, Nigeria. This paper assesses the challenges that PLWHA in the programme faced while maintaining their health and livelihoods. The frustrations that volunteers endured in performing their work are also described, as well as the benefits and weaknesses of the programme from the perspective of PLWHA and their volunteer caregivers. Focus groups and interviews were done with 30 PLWHA and 22 volunteers to learn about their experiences with the home-based care programme and possible areas for its improvement. From these discussions three major challenges facing PLWHA emerged: discrimination towards PLWHA; the lack of money, food, and transport to health-care centres; and the desire for closer antiretroviral drug access."
6204,0.004,4.0,"Several studies had previously demonstrated the high sensitivity and specificity of JCV DNA detection in CSF by PCR. This paper reported the implementation of a simple PCR procedure to detect JCV in the CSF in a cohort of HIV-1 infected patients from Argentina. Years ago, the confirmatory diagnosis of this disease was made by in-situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry techniques on brain biopsies. The PCR procedure described here improves the diagnosis of PML because it is simple and noninvasive, and allows the differential diagnosis of PML from other neurological syndromes associated with AIDS. Many recent studies report a significant benefit of combined antiretroviral therapy on the survival of HIV patients without clear neurological improvements. A negative correlation has been described between the concentration of JCV in the CSF and survival time in HIV-1 infected patients, and the level of immune depression may influence JCV replication. This suggests that a single CSF JCV viral load determination during the course of PML disease progression may be of prognostic value for managing HIV patients."
119,0.004,4.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in HIV-positive individuals. Although HBV vaccination is mandatory for HIV-positive individuals with negative-HBV markers, lower rates of protection are achieved. HIV infection accelerates the course of liver disease caused by chronic HBV infection, leading to end-stage hepatic illness and increasing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Anti-HBV active agents, especially tenofovir, improve outcomes. Lamivudine alone should be limited to patients with low serum HBV-DNA levels, since selection of drug resistance often compromises long-term benefits, leads to cross-resistance with other antivirals, and favors the potential emergence of HBV-vaccine escape mutants.

531,0.004,4.0,"The authors reviewed the medical records of 194 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients newly diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis and all 3,564 patients with newly diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at San Francisco General Hospital for the period 1986-1992. The study was designed to address three questions: 1) How do AIDS patients who present with cryptosporidiosis differ from other patients with AIDS? 2) What factors are associated with survival among AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis? 3) Does a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis impact survival after AIDS diagnosis? A total of 194 cases of cryptosporidiosis among HIV-infected patients were identified during the study period. Of the 194 patients, 109 (56%) had no prior diagnosis of AIDS. These 109 patients represented 3.1% of the 3,564 newly diagnosed cases of AIDS in the same period. Among the 134 patients with CD4 T-lymphocyte counts performed within 3 months of Cryptosporidium diagnosis, 34 (25%) had CD4 counts greater than 209 cells/ml. In a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the incidence of Cryptosporidium was related to ethnicity (for blacks vs. whites, matched odds ratio (OR) = 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.73), CD4 count (for a CD4 count of < or = 53 cells/ml vs. > 53 cells/ml, matched OR = 12.60, 95% CI 4.01-39.61), and age (for a 10-year increase, matched OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.98). Two factors measured at the time of Cryptosporidium diagnosis were identified as being independently associated with survival (p < 0.001) in the proportional hazards model: CD4 count < or = 53 cells/ml versus > 53 cells/ml (relative hazard = 6.18, 95% CI 2.99-12.76) and hematocrit < or 37% versus > 37% (relative hazard = 2.27, 95% CI 1.22-4.22). The median durations of survival in the four subgroups of Cryptosporidium-infected patients defined by these two variables differed significantly from each other (range, 204-1,119 days). Cryptosporidiosis as an initial AIDS-defining diagnosis was associated with an elevated relative hazard of death in comparison with other AIDS-defining diagnoses (relative hazard = 2.01, 95% CI 1.38-2.93). These data identify the groups of HIV-infected individuals at risk for presentation with symptomatic Cryptosporidium infection; the distinct survival patterns among subgroups of those patients already infected with this parasite; and the survival of AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis relative to patients with other AIDS-defining conditions. Such information is necessary for the design of prospective studies, the development of prophylactic strategies, the evaluation of candidate therapies, and the provision of prognostic information to patients."
8310,0.004,4.0,"Polymorphism in the HLA region of a chromosome is the major source of host genetic variability in HIV-1 outcome, but there is limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of protective class I alleles such as HLA-B57, -B27, and -B51. Taking advantage of a unique cohort infected with clade B' HIV-1 through contaminated blood, in which many variables such as the length of infection, the infecting viral strain, and host genetic background are controlled, we performed a comprehensive study to understand HLA-B51-associated HIV-1 control. We focused on the T cell responses against three dominant HLA-B51-restricted epitopes: Gag327-345(NI9) NANPDCKTI, Pol743-751(LI9) LPPVVAKEI, and Pol283-289(TI8) TAFTIPSI. Mutations in all three dominant epitopes were significantly associated with HLA-B51 in the cohort. A clear hierarchy in selection of epitope mutations was observed through epitope sequencing. L743I in position 1 of epitope LI9 was seen in most B51(+) individuals, followed by V289X in position 8 of the TI8, and then, A328S, in position 2 of the NI9 epitope, was also seen in some B51(+) individuals. Good control of viral load and higher CD4(+) counts were significantly associated with at least one detectable T cell response to unmutated epitopes, whereas lower CD4(+) counts and higher viral loads were observed in patients who had developed escape mutations in all three epitopes or who lacked T cell responses specific to these epitope(s). We propose that patients with HLA-B51 benefit from having multiple layers of effective defense against the development of immune escape mutations."
1187,0.004,4.0,"Patients with hepatitis C virus-related decompensated cirrhosis can benefit from interferon-based antiviral therapy, but the common complication of cytopenia is a contraindication for this treatment. Splenectomy prior to interferon therapy may alleviate this problem. To investigate whether splenectomy improves the efficacy of antiviral therapy, 13 interferon-naïve hepatitis C virus decompensated cirrhotic patients underwent splenectomy between January 2008 and January 2011, followed 1-3 months later by an interferon-based therapeutic regimen (pegylated/standard interferon-α combined with ribavirin for 48 weeks). Ten (76.9%) of the patients developed postoperative complications, which included minor portal vein thrombosis (2/13, 15.4%) and transient ascites (8/13, 61.5%). At one-month post-splenectomy, the patients showed significantly increased platelet (pre-surgery: 48.2±15.9 vs. 186.0±70.6×10(3)μL(-1), p<0.001) and leukocyte (2.1±0.5 vs. 5.7±1.4×10(3)μL(-1), p<0.001) counts. Eight (61.5%) of the patients achieved sustained virological response, including all HCV genotype 2a-infected patients (4/4, 100%) and some of the genotype 1b-infected patients (4/9, 44.4%). Temporary interferon-α suspension was required for one patient to address severe intestinal infection. These results indicate that splenectomy prior to interferon-based therapy was safe and may facilitate adherence to subsequent antiviral therapy in selected HCV cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension and hypersplenism.

2810,0.004,4.0,"Several reports show that the prevalence of HBV (hepatitis B virus) carriers in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infected populations is significantly higher than in HIV seronegative individuals, independent of the risk group for HIV, that is, homosexuals or drug abusers. In this context, evaluation of the simultaneous presence of HBV and HIV in PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) is of particular interest for at least 2 reasons: 1) the possible reciprocal influence of the 2 viruses when they infect the same cell; 2) the possibility that HIV-induced hematological disorders could indirectly influence the settling of HBV in blood cell populations. We report data on the frequency of PCR positivity for HBV DNA in PBMCs from 62 HIV infected patients, rigorously selected by risk group, that is, intravenous use of heroin for at least 3 years and syringe promiscuity. Sixty-seven HIV negative individuals who never used any drug formed the control group. The analysis of the cases positive for HBV DNA in PBMCs showed that: 1) the overall prevalence of PCR positivity found in HIV infected patients was significantly lower than that registered in the control group; 2) PCR positivity among the subjects who were HBsAg negative and anti-HBV positive was extremely low in the HIV infected patients (3.7%) but quite frequent in the HIV negative subjects (37.0%). The results support the hypothesis that, unlike the HIV negative individuals, our HIV infected patients exhibited HBV DNA in PBMCS almost exclusively when they presented with active HBV replication."
992,0.004,4.0,"Although smoking is common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals, in resource-constrained, high HIV prevalence settings, information on smoking cessation intent and acceptability is limited. Of 150 self-reported current smokers surveyed in two South African HIV clinics, 62 (42%) reported intent to quit smoking in the next year, while 86 (58%) were not interested in quitting or had no plan to quit; 132 (82%) had attempted to quit at least once in the past. Respondents' preferred cessation strategies were counseling and nicotine replacement. A high proportion of HIV-infected smokers want to quit, and interventions should be provided as part of HIV care."
7875,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific CD8 T-cell responses targeting products encoded within the Gag open reading frame have frequently been associated with better viral control and disease outcome during the chronic phase of HIV infection. To further clarify this relationship, we have studied the dynamics of Gag-specific CD8 T-cell responses in relation to plasma viral load and time since infection in 33 chronically infected subjects over a 9-month period. High baseline viral loads were associated with a net loss of breadth (P < 0.001) and a decrease in the total magnitude of the Gag-specific T-cell response in general (P = 0.03). Most importantly, the baseline viral load predicted the subsequent change in the breadth of Gag recognition over time (P < 0.0001, r(2) = 0.41). Compared to maintained responses, lost responses were low in magnitude (P < 0.0001) and subdominant in the hierarchy of Gag-specific responses. The present study indicates that chronic exposure of the human immune system to high levels of HIV viremia is a determinant of virus-specific CD8 T-cell loss."
6663,0.004,4.0,"In the United States, of the 1.1 million persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the 2.7 million infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), approximately 16% and 50%, respectively, are unaware of their infection. Highly effective treatments have turned both diseases into manageable conditions, and in the case of hepatitis C, a disease that can be cured. Early diagnosis is imperative so that infected persons can take measures to stay healthy, get into care, benefit from therapy, and reduce the risk of transmission. In this report, we review current recommendations provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Preventive Services Task Force on whom to screen for HIV and HCV infections, and recommendations from the CDC, the Association of Public Health Laboratories, and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute on how to test for these infections.

4856,0.004,4.0,"In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-1 infection frequently occurs in the context of other coinfecting pathogens, most importantly, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and malaria parasites. The consequences are often devastating, resulting in enhanced morbidity and mortality. Due to the large number of confounding factors influencing pathogenesis in coinfected people, we sought to develop a nonhuman primate model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-malaria coinfection. In sub-Saharan Africa, Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria parasite and is responsible for most malaria-induced deaths. The simian malaria parasite Plasmodium fragile can induce clinical symptoms, including cerebral malaria in rhesus macaques, that resemble those of P. falciparum infection in humans. Thus, based on the well-characterized rhesus macaque model of SIV infection, this study reports the development of a novel rhesus macaque SIV-P. fragile coinfection model to study human HIV-P. falciparum coinfection. Using this model, we show that coinfection is associated with an increased, although transient, risk of both HIV and malaria transmission. Specifically, SIV-P. fragile coinfected macaques experienced an increase in SIV viremia that was temporarily associated with an increase in potential SIV target cells and systemic immune activation during acute parasitemia. Conversely, primary parasitemia in SIV-P. fragile coinfected animals resulted in higher gametocytemia that subsequently translated into higher oocyst development in mosquitoes. To our knowledge, this is the first animal model able to recapitulate the increased transmission risk of both HIV and malaria in coinfected humans. Therefore, this model could serve as an essential tool to elucidate distinct immunological, virological, and/or parasitological parameters underlying disease exacerbation in HIV-malaria coinfected people."

1090,0.004,4.0,"This article reviews the research literature related to nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) concerning acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and care of people with AIDs (PWAs). Areas reviewed included the following: (1) KAP studies of health professionals that include nurses; (2) KAP studies of nurses; (3) KAP studies of nursing students and faculty; (4) studies of stress and coping related to care of PWAs; and (5) studies of outcomes of AIDS education programs. Gaps in knowledge and negative, fearful attitudes toward HIV transmission and PWAs were identified. Negative fears and behaviors decreased in nurses with the gain in accurate information. The studies were largely atheoretical descriptive surveys of health professionals in acute care settings. Studies of nurses specifically, including more studies of obstetric and pediatric nurses, and nurses in a range of settings in the community would be beneficial both in the United States and in other countries. A wider variety of research designs including qualitative studies are needed as are valid and reliable instruments to allow for cross-comparisons between studies. An assessment of non-AIDS-related content, such as spiritual needs of patients and substances abuse is needed by nurses who care for PWAs for use in development of relevant educational programs."
540,0.004,4.0,"Puerto Rico has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS seen for any US state or territory, and antiretroviral therapy has been a mainstay of efforts to mitigate the HIV/AIDS public health burden on the island. We studied the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 mutation and antiretroviral drug resistance in Puerto Rico by monitoring the population frequency of resistance-associated mutations from 2002 to 2011. Whole blood samples from 4,475 patients were analyzed using the TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit and OpenGene DNA Sequencing System in the Immunoretrovirus Research Laboratory at Universidad Central del Caribe. Results show that 64.0% of female and 62.9% of male patients had HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to at least one antiretroviral medication. L63P and M184V were the dominant mutations observed for the protease (PRO) and reverse transcriptase (RT) encoding genes, respectively. Specific resistance mutations, along with their associated drug resistance profiles, can be seen to form temporal clusters that reveal a steadily changing landscape of resistance trends over time. Both women and men showed resistance mutations for an average of 4.8 drugs over the 10-year period, further underscoring the strong selective pressure exerted by antiretrovirals along with the rapid adaptive response of HIV. Nevertheless, both female and male patients showed a precipitous decrease for overall drug resistance, and for PRO mutations in particular, over the entire course of the study, with the most rapid decrease in frequency seen after 2006. The reduced HIV-1 mutation and drug resistance trends that we observed are consistent with previous reports from multi-year studies conducted around the world. Reduced resistance can be attributed to the use of more efficacious antiretroviral drug therapy, including the introduction of multi-drug combination therapies, which limited the ability of the virus to mount rapid adaptive responses to antiretroviral selection pressure."
3186,0.004,4.0,"During infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV), most patients develop mild or asymptomatic disease. However, a small number of patients develop serious, life-threatening hepatitis. We investigated this variability in disease severity by examining 30 Argentinean patients with HAV-induced acute liver failure in a case-control, cross-sectional, observational study. We found that HAV-induced severe liver disease was associated with a 6-amino-acid insertion in TIM1/HAVCR1 (157insMTTTVP), the gene encoding the HAV receptor. This polymorphism was previously shown to be associated with protection against asthma and allergic diseases and with HIV progression. In binding assays, the TIM-1 protein containing the 157insMTTTVP insertion polymorphism bound HAV more efficiently. When expressed by human natural killer T (NKT) cells, this long form resulted in greater NKT cell cytolytic activity against HAV-infected liver cells, compared with the shorter TIM-1 protein without the polymorphism. To our knowledge, the 157insMTTTVP polymorphism in TIM1 is the first genetic susceptibility factor shown to predispose to HAV-induced acute liver failure. Furthermore, these results suggest that HAV infection has driven the natural selection of shorter forms of the TIM-1 protein, which binds HAV less efficiently, thereby protecting against severe HAV-induced disease, but which may predispose toward inflammation associated with asthma and allergy."
359,0.004,4.0,"To prevent transmission of bloodborne pathogens, it is important that health care providers adhere to standard precautions, follow fundamental infection-control principles, and use appropriate procedural techniques. All obstetrician-gynecologists who provide clinical care should receive the hepatitis B virus vaccine series. The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America has established guidelines for the management of health care providers who are infected with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The guidelines categorize representative obstetric and gynecologic procedures according to level of risk of bloodborne pathogen transmission and include recommendations for health care provider clinical activities, based on these categories and viral burden. It is important to note that when no restrictions are recommended, careful supervision should be carried out as highlighted. These recommendations provide a framework within which to consider such cases; however, each case should be independently considered in context by the expert review panel. "
7355,0.004,4.0,Drug resistance is a major concern during nucleoside/ nucleotide analogues therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections.

6026,0.004,4.0,"Having noted the good clinical status of some HIV patients who were referred for but refused surgery, we undertook surgery with the aim of determining outcome, risk-to-benefit ratio and, if possible, the effect of surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on the progression of their HIV disease. Antiretroviral drugs (ARVD) were not available to these patients. The records of 49 patients, 17 males and 32 females, aged between 17 and 67 years, undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass over a nine-year period, were reviewed. Forty-eight of these underwent cardiac surgery and one aortic dissection repair. Four HIV-infected patients underwent surgery with good early outcome. Thereafter an absolute CD4 cell count greater than 400/microl (normal 550*1 955/microl) and the absence of the stigmata of AIDS in patients fulfilling the normal criteria for surgery allowed cardiac surgery using CPB. Fifty operations were performed. Three patients with CD4 counts of 37, 868 and 1 245/microl died early, giving a 30-day mortality of 6% for 50 procedures. Six patients with active infective endocarditis (IE) underwent emergency surgery. Three of these, one with a pre- and two with only post-operative counts all below 250/microl, died within three months. Sixteen complications occurred in the remaining 46 patients (34.7%). Pre-operative CD4 cell counts taken in 42 patients averaged 685/microl. Pre- and post-operative counts known in eight showed variations, as did repeated counts in those awaiting surgery. Forty-one patients left hospital in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, five in class II and one in class III. Prior to surgery, the majority (38) were in class III and seven were in class IV. Follow up ranging from two to 70 months averaged 23.1 months. Eight late deaths occurred, three related to AIDS. We found surgery to be worthwhile in selected HIV-infected patients. Early outcome paralleled that in the uninfected, giving a low risk-to-benefit ratio. Emergency surgery in those with active infective endocarditis and marked immune compromise met with high mortality. It is essential in our population to test and stage all patients for HIV. We could not show that CPB accelerated progression to AIDS. This experience and the present availability of ARVDs would enable us to review our selection criteria for surgery."
4855,0.004,4.0,"Data on baseline hepatic function of HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infected patients are limited in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed liver function test (LFT) abnormalities in Nigerian patients with HIV/HBV co-infection to highlight the impact of HIV on HBV-related liver disease in sub-Saharan Africa. A cross-sectional study involving 100 HIV/HBV co-infected patients and 100 age- and sex-matched HBV mono-infected controls. Blood testing for HIV antibodies, CD4+ cell count, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), LFTs, platelet count, fasting blood glucose and lipid profile were carried out. Non-invasive hepatic fibrosis scores (aspartate aminotransferase-platelet ratio index [APRI] and FIB-4) were also calculated. Co-infected patients had deranged liver enzymes more than the controls (77% versus 64%, P = 0.04). The predominant patterns of enzyme derangement in co-infected patients were either predominantly ↑ALP (30% versus 4%, P < 0.0001) or mixed (30% versus 15%, P = 0.01) but predominantly ↑AST/ALT in the controls (25% versus 9%, P = 0.003). Co-infected patients had higher fibrosis scores for both APRI (P = 0.002) and FIB-4 (P = 0.0001). On further analysis, LFT abnormalities and fibrosis scores were only significantly higher in co-infected patients in the immune clearance and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis phases. LFT abnormalities are common in Nigerians with HBV infection and co-infection with HIV negatively impacts on hepatic function."
8326,0.004,4.0,"Prevalence and risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were studied in 2,587 pregnant women from three rural Egyptian villages in the Nile Delta being admitted to a prospective cohort study of maternal-infant transmission; 408 (15.8%) had antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) and 279 (10.8%) also had HCV-RNA. Fewer than 1% gave a history of jaundice or liver disease. Risk factors for anti-HCV included increasing age, low socioeconomic status and a history of blood transfusion or injection therapy for schistosomiasis. Sub-analyses after stratification of subjects by village revealed risks associated with specific venues for medical care, having a previous delivery attended by a traditional birth assistant (TBA), receiving medical care in a temporary clinic located in a mosque, overnight admission to a private doctor's clinic, and circumcision by a TBA or a 'health barber'. Our results suggest HCV causes very little detected illness in young adult Egyptian women and some sources of HCV transmission in rural Egypt in the past were associated with the provision of medical care and varied by location. Prevention should be focused on providing appropriate resources and health education should be given to formal and informal health care providers and should be sufficiently broad to adjust for local variations in exposures."
7640,0.004,4.0,"Dementia was a frequent consequence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in developed countries before antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available and remains a common neurologic complication of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among patients receiving appropriate therapy. The epidemiology of HIV dementia (HIV-D) in Africa remains unclear 20+ years into the AIDS epidemic. Early studies of cognitive impairment in HIV-positive populations in Africa were limited by vaguely defined criteria for cognitive impairment, inadequate assessment tools lacking ecologic validation, and the absence of normative population data. More recent studies have clarified definitions of impairment, utilized more sophisticated measures, and included normative comparisons. Unfortunately, these detailed neuropsychiatric assessments are not feasible for population-based studies or routine clinical implementation. Therefore, the prevalence data available for HIV-D in Africa represents rates found in people presenting to tertiary care centers and are unlikely to reflect HIV-D rates in the general population. As ART becomes available in Africa, future research efforts must provide a better understanding of the epidemiology of HIV-D, the effects of available ART regimens on HIV-D in this population, and the impact of HIV-D on ART adherence. Universally accepted terminology and criteria for HIV-D are needed. Population-based studies will require the development of neuropsychiatric batteries that can be adapted across a range of African environments. Ideally, these measures will be viable for nonphysician care providers to use as screening tools in the first stage of epidemiologic studies. Such screening tools could also serve as clinical indicators of possible HIV-related cognitive impairment facilitate implementation of ART adherence."
6349,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), formerly termed human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLVIII/LAV), is the etiological agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Direct detection of HIV-1 nucleic acid sequences in patient tissue or blood samples is possible in only a minor fraction of cases due to the low percentage of infected cells (Shaw et al., 1984). We report a modification of the polymerase chain reaction method (PCR) (Saiki et al., 1985), in which we amplify sequences from HIV-1 RNA templates, for the identification of HIV-1 in peripheral blood and tissue samples obtained from AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC) patients. This method of HIV-1 detection is at least six orders of magnitude more sensitive than standard nucleic acid detection methods and has direct clinical applications. In vitro tissue culturing of the virus is not required for HIV-1 detection. Using this technique, the sequence in the orfB region of HIV-1 has been amplified and detected from less than 1 microgram of total RNA prepared from a few milliliters of peripheral blood samples. This technique enables the rapid and unambiguous clinical detection of potential HIV-infected individuals and can be used to assay the efficacy of anti-HIV-1 drugs. To enhance the efficiency of this technique, we have appended the prokaryotic T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence to one of the priming oligonucleotides. After several cycles of PCR with the promoter-containing oligo, a small aliquot of the reaction can be utilized to direct specific and efficient T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription of the amplified sequences, thus enhancing the sensitivity and simplifying the labor of the experiment."
5998,0.004,4.0,"To define factors predictive of failure to respond to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-infected subjects pretreated with zidovudine (ZDV), three groups of subjects shifted to double therapy with ZDV plus didanosine (ddI, n = 13), zalcitabine (ddC, n = 14), or lamivudine (3TC, n = 12) were retrospectively evaluated, with respect to addition of the second NRTI, at week 0 and week 24. Factors considered included duration of ZDV pretreatment, CD4+ cell counts, plasma HIV-1 RNA load, peripheral blood mononuclear cell HIV-1 DNA load, and HIV-1 DNA genotypic resistance to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. The three groups were well matched for baseline characteristics and did not differ significantly in virological and immunological response to the different combination treatments. Drug-specific resistance mutations were selected in more than half the cases by 3TC, but not by ddI and ddC. Low-level and substantial genotypic resistance to ZDV was detected 13 (33.3%) and in 19 (48.7%) patients at baseline, respectively, and evolved through week 24 in several patients. When subjects were divided into responders and nonresponders to the second nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor on the basis of a decrease of more than 0.5 log10 (n = 15) or less than 0.5 log10 (n = 21) in HIV-1 RNA, respectively, baseline genotypic ZDV resistance was the only independent predictor of failure in a logistic regression model (P = 0.003 or P = 0.024, depending on whether low-level resistance was considered or not, respectively). Thus, selection of ZDV resistance mutations may impair subsequent use of different nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor compounds."

4552,0.004,4.0,"Patients with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection have more severe hepatitis-related disease than do patients with HCV infection alone. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with protease inhibitor appears to restore pathogen-specific immune responses, especially in patients with persistent undetectable HIV viral load. To evaluate the potent impact of immune restoration induced by HAART on the course of HCV-related disease, HCV viremia and levels of transaminases were compared between two groups of patients: 10 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with persistently undetectable HIV viremia (group A) and 12 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with persistent detectable HIV viremia. No difference was detected in HCV viral load in either group. An increase in transaminases was found only in patients with persistent undetectable HIV viral load, which was correlated with the increase in CD8+ T cells. This may suggest that the restoration of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity could lead to an enhancement of hepatitis C-related disease in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients receiving HAART."
5405,0.004,4.0,The prevalence of hepatitisC is decreasing among new diagnoses of HIV/HCV coinfection in Spain. The increasing use of the HCV treatment could have changed the HCV genotype distribution. The aim of this study is to analyze changes in the prevalence of HCV coinfection and in HCV genotype distribution among HIV-infected patients.
682,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) frequently causes neurological dysfunction and is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with HIV encephalitis or myelopathy. The virus is found mostly in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage within the CNS, but the possibility of infection of other glial cells has been raised. Therefore, the effects of different HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains were studied in primary cultures of adult human brain containing microglial cells, the resident CNS macrophages, and astrocytes. These cultures could be productively infected with macrophage-adapted HIV-1 isolates but not with T lymphocyte-adapted HIV-1 isolates or two HIV-2 isolates. As determined with a triple-label procedure, primary astrocytes did not express HIV gag antigens and remained normal throughout the 3-week course of infection. In contrast, virus replicated in neighboring microglial cells, often leading to their cell fusion and death. The death of microglial cells, which normally serve immune functions in the CNS, may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of AIDS encephalitis or myelopathy."
3033,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) increases morbidity in Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients. In the mid-eighties, an outbreak of HDV fulminant hepatitis (FH) in the Central African Republic (CAR) killed 88% of patients hospitalized in Bangui. We evaluated infections with HBV and HDV among students and pregnant women, 25 years after the fulminant hepatitis (FH) outbreak to determine (i) the prevalence of HBV and HDV infection in this population, (ii) the clinical risk factors for HBV and/or HDV infections, and (iii) to characterize and compare the strains from the FH outbreak in the 1980s to the 2010 HBV-HDV strains. We performed a cross sectional study with historical comparison on FH-stored samples (n = 179) from 159 patients and dried blood-spots from volunteer students and pregnant women groups (n = 2172). We analyzed risk factors potentially associated with HBV and HDV. Previous HBV infection (presence of anti-HBc) occurred in 345/1290 students (26.7%) and 186/870 pregnant women (21.4%)(p = 0.005), including 110 students (8.8%) and 71 pregnant women (8.2%), who were also HBsAg-positive (p = 0.824). HDV infection occurred more frequently in pregnant women (n = 13; 18.8%) than students (n = 6; 5.4%) (p = 0.010). Infection in childhood was probably the main HBV risk factor. The risk factors for HDV infection were age (p = 0.040), transfusion (p = 0.039), and a tendency for tattooing (p = 0.055) and absence of condom use (p = 0.049). HBV-E and HDV-1 were highly prevalent during both the FH outbreak and the 2010 screening project. For historical samples, due to storage conditions and despite several attempts, we could only obtain partial HDV amplification representing 25% of the full-length genome. The HDV-1 mid-eighties FH-strains did not form a specific clade and were affiliated to two different HDV-1 African subgenotypes, one of which also includes the 2010 HDV-1 strains. In the Central African Republic, these findings indicate a high prevalence of previous and current HBV-E and HDV-1 infections both in the mid-eighties fulminant hepatitis outbreak and among asymptomatic young adults in 2010, and reinforce the need for universal HBV vaccination and the prevention of HDV transmission among HBsAg-positive patients through blood or sexual routes."
7285,0.004,4.0,"The objective of this opinion paper was to identify and describe potential clinical pharmacists' services for the prevention and management of patients infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The goals of this paper are to guide the establishment and development of pharmacy services for patients infected with HCV and to highlight HCV research and educational opportunities. Recommendations were based on the following: a review of published data on clinical pharmacist involvement in the treatment and management of HCV-infected patients; a consensus of clinical pharmacists who provide direct patient care to HCV-infected patients and practice in different pharmacy models, including community-based and academic settings; and a review of published guidelines and literature focusing on the treatment and management of HCV infections. The recommendations provided in this opinion paper define the areas of clinical pharmacist involvement and clinical pharmacy practice in the treatment and management of patients with HCV. Clinical pharmacists can promote preventive measures and education about reducing HCV transmission, improve medication adherence, assist in monitoring clinical and adverse effects, recommend treatment strategies to minimize adverse effects and drug interactions, and facilitate medication acquisition and logistics that positively improve patient outcomes and reduce the health care system costs.

7128,0.004,4.0,"To investigate its use as a marker of disease severity, serum soluble CD4 (sCD4) was measured by ELISA in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Levels of sCD4 were higher in patients than in controls (P less than .001) but did not increase with disease severity. sCD4 release per CD4 lymphocyte showed a linear increase with disease severity and performed as well as beta 2-microglobulin, a widely used marker. To study the role of sCD4 in the pathogenesis of HIV infection, an ELISA to detect sCD4 complexed with glycoprotein 120 (gp120) HIV envelope protein was developed. Preformed sCD4-gp120 complexes were not detectable in patient serum, but addition of recombinant gp120 showed that circulating sCD4 is capable of binding HIV envelope proteins. This study indicates that the sCD4-to-CD4 lymphocyte ratio increases linearly with disease severity and may be a useful marker of CD4 lymphocyte damage. In addition, serum sCD4 can bind viral particles, which may have implications for the use of recombinant sCD4 as a therapy in HIV infection."
4386,0.004,4.0,"Implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has deeply changed the landscape of HIV-associated malignancies. Some AIDS-defining tumors, namely Primitive Lymphoma of Central Nervous System, have drastically declined, whereas a steady increase has been observed for non-AIDS-defining tumors, maybe due to longer survival of HIV-infected people. Easier immune restoration, subsequent to availability of a number of drugs targeting HIV at different points, has decreased opportunistic infections which hampered treatment of HIV-associated cancers. As a matter of fact these patients have been assimilated more and more with their negative counterpart, undergoing the same aggressive approach. Consistently, procedures that have been so far precluded to HIV+ subjects, such as transplant of hemopoietic stem cells, either autologous or allogenic, and liver transplant are expected to be performed more and more extensively in this population. Which also would mean a full removal of the stigma which has weighed on it. Hence, it is true-like that malignancies and related problems may in the next future make up a main concern for the HIV specialist. Old and new challenges might be the drug-drug interaction of antiretrovirals or biotherapy-related infections or the debated question of an earlier HAART implementation in the course of HIV disease, with CD4+ cells > 500/μl. In fact, if assimilation of HIV patients with cancer and the general population is a remarkable achieved goal, uniqueness of HIV infection in terms of immune status still makes HIV-associated cancer a unique chapter in the setting of Oncology."
6573,0.004,4.0," Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor indicated for treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Despite the good safety profile of the drug, Fanconi syndrome is a possible adverse reaction of TDF treatment, especially in HIV-infected patients. Only a few cases have been reported in patients with CHB-monoinfections. This report presents a case of a 58-year-old man with mild HBeAg-negative CHB who was exposed to TDF and developed drug-induced Fanconi syndrome. Renal dysfunction reverted after TDF discontinuation and a switch to entecavir, and viral replication remained suppressed. A literature review yielded six additional cases of TDF-induced Fanconi syndrome, all with risk factors for renal dysfunction despite the patients having normal glomerular filtration rates. We discuss the overall risk for Fanconi syndrome in CHB-monoinfected patients exposed to TDF and the importance of careful monitoring of glomerular and tubular functions even when pre-existing kidney disease is not present.

7221,0.004,4.0,"Delivery by elective cesarean section (ECS), cesarean section prior to labor and rupture of membranes, is associated with a lower rate of vertical transmission of HIV compared with other modes of delivery. The efficacy of ECS among women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy or among women with low viral loads is unknown. In assessing the possible utility of ECS as an intervention to decrease vertical transmission in the United States and other countries, the potential risks associated with operative delivery as well as other considerations should also be addressed. Although cesarean section delivery is associated with an increased rate of postpartum morbidity compared with vaginal delivery in the general population, operative delivery performed emergently carries a higher risk of complications than scheduled or elective procedures. Analyses of the risk of postpartum morbidity according to mode of delivery among HIV-infected women have been performed in the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the largest database in North America with relevant data, as well as other, smaller databases. These analyses suggest a similar pattern to that observed in the general population. In addition to quantifying the incidence of postpartum morbidity events, it is also important to distinguish between minor and major morbidity. Neonatal morbidity related to ECS is generally due to iatrogenic preterm birth, that is, situations where the gestational age is not accurately assessed prior to delivery. Occupationally acquired HIV infection related to obstetric procedures is a possibility, although risk related to mode of delivery is unknown. The results of economic analyses of ECS compared to vaginal delivery in the US indicate that ECS is a cost-effective intervention in preventing vertical transmission of HIV among women who refrain from breastfeeding. However, more precise estimates of the risk of vertical transmission among women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and of the potential risks of maternal and pediatric adverse events related to receipt of such therapy are needed. In summary, the benefit of ECS must be weighed against potential risks, and issues such as cost-effectiveness also should be taken into consideration."
8221,0.004,4.0,"The RNA genome of the lentivirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is significantly richer in adenine nucleotides than the statistically equal distribution of the four different nucleotides that is expected. This compositional bias may be due to the guanine-to-adenine (G-->A) nucleotide hypermutation of the HIV genome, which has been explained by dCTP pool imbalances during reverse transcription. The adenine nucleotide bias together with the poor fidelity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase markedly enhances the genetic variation of HIV and may be responsible for the rapid emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. We have now attempted to counteract the normal mutational pattern of HIV-1 in response to anti-HIV-1 drugs by altering the endogenous deoxynucleoside triphosphate pool ratios with antimetabolites in virus-infected cell cultures. We showed that administration of these antimetabolic compounds resulted in an altered drug resistance pattern due to the reversal of the predominant mutational flow of HIV (G-->A) to an adenine-to-guanine (A-->G) nucleotide pattern in the intact HIV-1-infected lymphocyte cultures. Forcing the virus to change its inherent nucleotide bias may lead to better control of viral drug resistance development."
6578,0.004,4.0,"A study of 215 Berlin dentists and 108 dental assistants recruited at the 1997 Berlin Dental Society meeting assessed their occupational risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HBV vaccine coverage, and barrier prevention methods used. Among dentists, 7% (95% CI 4-11) and 0.5% (95% CI 0-3) had serological evidence of previous HBV and HCV infection, respectively. Similar figures for dental assistants were 1% (95% CI 0-5) and 0% (95% CI 0-4). Only 74% of dentists and 63% of dental assistants reported HBV vaccination. Approximately half always used gloves, eye glasses, or face masks. HBV unvaccinated dentists whose patients had HBV risk factors had a greater risk of HBV infection; those who always wore face masks were at lower risk (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.02-0.98). These data indicate that among Berlin dentists, the HCV risk was lower than that of HBV and that face masks may have lowered the risk of HBV. The use of eye glasses or gloves did not appear to lower the risk of HBV acquisition in this population."
7341,0.004,4.0,"Dried blood spot (DBS) is a reliable method of blood collection used for the diagnosis of several human diseases. DBS is particularly useful for diagnosing children and for the screening of high-risk populations especially in countries where health facilities are not readily accessible. This report describes a qualitative SYBR Green-based real-time multiplex RT-PCR for the simultaneous detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomes in DBS. Specific viral amplicons were identified in the same sample by their distinctive melting temperatures. The analysis of scalar concentrations of the reference samples indicated that this multiplex procedure detects at least 2500 copies/ml of HCV and 400 copies/ml of HIV-1. HIV-1 and HCV viral loads in 20 patients infected with HIV-1 and/or HCV and in 5 healthy blood donors were also tested, confirming the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. This method may represent a reliable alternative for the detection of HIV-1/HCV co-infection, in rapid and relatively inexpensive screening programmes."
57,0.004,4.0,"We wished to undertake molecular characterization of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene and overlapping surface (S) gene in lamivudine-treated patients with chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sequencing analyses of the HBV RT/S gene of isolates from 25 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with the YMDD mutation and 30 treatment-naïve CHB patients were undertaken. In patients with the YMDD mutation, rtM2041 was the major type of mutation (20/25, 80%). rtL80I was present in most of the patients with rtM204I (14/20, 70%). rtL180M coexisted with rtM204V (5/5, 100%). Patients with the YMDD mutation had a significantly higher prevalence of mutation of the RT gene than treatment-naïve CHB patients (P < 0.05). Classical primary resistance and secondary/compensatory mutations were detected at only five sites (rtL80, rtV173, rtL180, rtM204, rtM250) in CHB patients with the YMDD mutation. The frequency of nucleos(t)ide analog resistance (NAr) mutation within the RT gene in patients with the YMDD mutation was significantly higher than that in treatment-naïve patients (P < 0.05). Amino-acid mutations within the RT gene were also associated with other types of NAr in patients with the YMDD mutation. The rate of amino-acid variants within the S gene region was significantly higher in patients with the YMDD mutation than that in treatment-naïve patients (P < 0.05). sM133L and sG145R variants were also present in patients with the YMDD mutation. These observations suggest that CHB patients with the YMDD mutation also have NAr mutations related to other NA drugs, which might lead to cross-resistance in CHB patients. Variants present in the S gene region could cause changes in the antigenicity of HBsAg, which could result in a false-negative diagnosis of HBsAg and immune in escape of the HBV."

4172,0.004,4.0,"Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is believed to be associated with reduced hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity and risk factors such as alcohol abuse and medication with oral contraceptives and certain other drugs. Recently it has been suggested that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may also be associated with PCT. We have therefore reviewed the prevalence of HCV infection in a series of patients with PCT in the Lothian region of Scotland. We identified 12 patients with PCT, all of whom had abnormal liver function tests. Liver histology revealed chronic active hepatitis in six patients, micronodular cirrhosis in four patients, hepatocellular carcinoma in one patient and normal findings in one HIV positive patient. Out of 12 patients tested, 11 were positive for anti-HCV antibodies by second generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA 2), and by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA 2); positive serology was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In a second group of 14 patients with chronic HCV infection matched for age and sex with the PCT patients, all had normal urinary uroporphyrin excretion. We have thus confirmed in Scotland early reports from Spain and Italy that PCT is strongly associated with HCV infection. This could explain the development of inflammatory changes in the liver and progression of liver disease in patients with PCT. Porphyrin metabolism, however, appears normal in patients with chronic HCV infection without PCT."
2566,0.004,4.0,"Infection of macrophages has been implicated as a critical event in the transmission and persistence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Here, we explore whether primary X4 HIV-1 isolates can productively infect tissue macrophages that have terminally differentiated in vivo. Using immunohistochemistry, HIV-1 RNA in situ hybridization, and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that macrophages residing in human tonsil blocks can be productively infected ex vivo by primary X4 HIV-1 isolates. This challenges the model in which macrophage tropism is a key determinant of the selective transmission of R5 HIV-1 strains. Infection of tissue macrophages by X4 HIV-1 may be highly relevant in vivo and contribute to key events in HIV-1 pathogenesis."
6649,0.004,4.0,"HIV subtype C is the most prevalent subtype in the world. Despite its recent expansion in Brazil, HIV-1C already prevails in the southernmost state of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul. This unique HIV epidemiology has prompted us to characterize that population. Seventy-seven HIV-1-infected subjects attending the largest HIV/AIDS clinic of the state had the protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes of their virus subtyped and genotyped. When subtype-specific infections were plotted according to year of diagnosis, the prevalence of subtype C was shown to increase over the last 18 years of the epidemic, along with a concomitant decrease of subtype B. Comparison of subtype C-infected treated and untreated subjects revealed amino acid differences in protease and RT, especially in the RT mutation D/G123S. The overall analysis of drug resistance mutations in viruses from treated subjects has highlighted some associations between subtypes and particular mutations, such as V82A/F/T/S in protease and subtype F1 and M41L and L210W in RT and subtype B. The characterization of this important population, which is one of a few in the developing world where a large number of HIV-1C-infected subjects are under antiretroviral treatment, underscores its potential usefulness in clinical, treatment, and vaccine trials in Brazil."
2031,0.004,4.0,"Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is more prevalent than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but more public health resources are allocated to HIV than to HCV. Given shared risk factors and epidemiology, we compared accuracy of health beliefs about HIV and HCV in an at-risk community. Between 2002 and 2003, we surveyed a random patient sample at a primary care clinic in New York. The survey was organized as domains of Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation: causes ('sharing needles'), timeline/consequences ('remains in body for life', 'causes cancer') and controllability ('I can avoid this illness', 'medications may cure this illness'). We compared differences in accuracy of beliefs about HIV and HCV and used multivariable linear regression to identify factors associated with relative accuracy of beliefs. One hundred and twenty-two subjects completed the survey (response rate 42%). Mean overall health belief accuracy was 12/15 questions (80%) for HIV vs 9/15 (60%) for HCV (P < 0.001). Belief accuracy was significantly different across all domains. Within the causes domain, 60% accurately believed sharing needles a risk factor for HCV compared to 92% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the timeline/consequences domain, 42% accurately believed HCV results in lifelong infection compared to 89% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the controllability domain, 25% accurately believed that there is a potential cure for HCV. Multivariable linear regression revealed female gender as significantly associated with greater health belief accuracy for HIV. Thus, study participants had significantly less accurate health beliefs about HCV than about HIV. Targeting inaccuracies might improve public health interventions to foster healthier behaviours and better hepatitis C outcomes."

People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) can experience multiple physical symptoms or problems related to HIV infection and treatment. A common problem for PLWHA continues to be diarrhea and nausea and vomiting (NV). Diarrhea and NV can negatively impact the quality of life and adherence to medication therapy among PLWHA and are common reasons to change or discontinue HAART regimens. Because diarrhea and NV can have substantial negative health outcomes for PLWHA, it is important to understand the causes of these conditions."
2186,0.004,4.0,"A successful pregnancy is characterised by an increase in Th2 cytokines and suppression of Th1 cytokine production. A Th1 to Th2 cytokine shift is also observed in the disease progression of HIV infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) suppresses HIV viremia, increases CD4+ cell counts and counteracts the Th1 to Th2 shift. We hypothesised that the increased risk of premature delivery reported in HIV-infected, HAART-treated pregnant women is mediated through changes in the cytokine environment in pregnancy. Here, we present results relating to levels of interleukin (IL)-2 (Th1) and IL-10 (Th2) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) measured three times during pregnancy in 49 HIV-infected women. Slope values representing the trend of repeated cytokine (IL-2-PHA, IL-2-Env, IL-10-PHA and IL-10-Env) measurements within women during pregnancy were estimated and median values compared by prematurity and HAART use. Multiple regression adjusted for HAART and cytokine slope clarified the additional and independent effect of HAART on prematurity risk. Results showed favourable immunomodulation induced by HAART with increased IL-2 and decreased IL-10. HAART use and IL-10-Env slopes were not significantly associated with prematurity risk, but each unit increase in IL-2-PHA slope was associated with an 8% increased risk of premature delivery (AOR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.0-1.17; p=0.005). HAART use in pregnancy provides significant benefits in delaying HIV disease progression and reducing the risk of mother-to-child-transmission, but may be counterproductive in terms of successful pregnancy outcome."
3228,0.004,4.0,"To our knowledge, the epidemiology of hospital-acquired infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients during long-term care has not been reported. For 13 months, we observed HIV-infected patients (50 men and 15 women) in a dedicated 21-bed unit in a long-term-care facility to determine the rate of nosocomial infections. The mean age of the patients was 39 years (range, 22-78 years); 74% of the patients had CD4 cell counts of < 200/mm3. There was a total of 152 infections (24 infections per 1,000 long-term-care days). The factors associated with the occurrence of a nosocomial infection were low CD4 cell counts, poor functional status, and longer duration of stays at the facility. The three most common infections were Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, primary bacteremia, and urinary tract infection. Eighteen hospital-manifested opportunistic infections occurred. More than 50% of the cases of bacteremia were due to multidrug-resistant organisms. Nosocomial infections occur commonly in HIV-infected patients in long-term care and thus are important considerations in patient management."
2416,0.004,4.0,"Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) constitute the main burden of infectious disease in resource-limited countries. In the individual host, the two pathogens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV, potentiate one another, accelerating the deterioration of immunological functions. In high-burden settings, HIV coinfection is the most important risk factor for developing active TB, which increases the susceptibility to primary infection or reinfection and also the risk of TB reactivation for patients with latent TB. M. tuberculosis infection also has a negative impact on the immune response to HIV, accelerating the progression from HIV infection to AIDS. The clinical management of HIV-associated TB includes the integration of effective anti-TB treatment, use of concurrent antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevention of HIV-related comorbidities, management of drug cytotoxicity, and prevention/treatment of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

9205,0.004,4.0,"This paper examines factors associated with adherence to antiretroviral medications (ARVs) in an HIV-infected population at high risk for non-adherence: individuals living with psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. Data were examined from baseline interviews of a multisite cohort intervention study of 1138 HIV-infected adults with both a psychiatric and substance abuse disorder (based on a structured psychiatric research interview using DSM-IV criteria). The baseline interview documented mental illness and substance use in the past year, mental illness and substance abuse severity, demographics, service utilization in the past three months, general health and HIV-related conditions, self-reported spirituality and self-reported ARV medication use. Among the participants, 62% were prescribed ARVs at baseline (n = 542) and 45% of those on ARVs reported skipping medications in the past three days. Reports of non-adherence were significantly associated with having a detectable viral load (p<.01). The factors associated with non-adherence were current drug and alcohol abuse, increased psychological distress, less attendance at medical appointments, non-adherence to psychiatric medications and lower self-reported spirituality. Increased psychological distress was significantly associated with non-adherence, independent of substance abuse (p<.05). The data suggest that both mental illness and substance use must be addressed in HIV-infected adults living with these co-morbid illnesses to improve adherence to ARVs."
9057,0.004,4.0,"The prevalence of infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV), HBV, HCV, HDV, and HEV was evaluated in 249 apparently healthy individuals, including 122 inhabitants in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia, and 127 age- and sex-matched members of nomadic tribes who lived around the capital city. Overall, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected in 24 subjects (10%), of whom 22 (92%) had detectable HBV DNA. Surprisingly, HDV RNA was detectable in 20 (83%) of the 24 HBsAg-positive subjects. HCV-associated antibodies were detected in 41 (16%) and HCV RNA was detected in 36 (14%) subjects, none of whom was coinfected with HBV, indicating that HBV/HCV carriers account for one-fourth of this population. Antibodies to HAV and HEV were detected in 249 (100%) and 28 (11%) subjects, respectively. Of 22 HBV DNA-positive subjects, genotype D was detected in 21 subjects and genotype F was detected in 1 subject. All 20 HDV isolates recovered from HDV RNA-positive subjects segregated into genotype I, but these differed by 2.1 to 11.4% from each other in the 522- to 526-nucleotide sequence. Of 36 HCV RNA-positive samples, 35 (97%) were genotype 1b and 1 was genotype 2a. Reflecting an extremely high prevalence of hepatitis virus infections, there were no appreciable differences in the prevalence of hepatitis virus markers between the two studied populations with distinct living place and lifestyle. A nationwide epidemiological survey of hepatitis viruses should be conducted in an effort to prevent de novo infection with hepatitis viruses in Mongolia."
9920,0.004,4.0,"The prevalence, virological and epidemiological aspects of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections vary among hemodialysis patients in different countries. Aiming at analyzing these aspects of HCV and HBV infections in hemodialysis patients in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil, we studied three hemodialysis units including 434 patients. Serology was used to detect anti-HCV and HBsAg. Reverse trancriptase nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested-PCR) of the 5'-noncoding region was used to detect circulating HCV RNA and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for genotyping. Seroprevalence varied from 26.5% to 11.1% for hepatitis C and from 5.9% to 0% for hepatitis B. Risk factors observed for HBV and/or HCV infections were the number of patients per dialysis unit, duration of treatment, number of clinics attended, number of blood units transfused, and lower level scholarity. Alanine aminotransferase levels were altered with a higher frequency in HBV or HCV seropositive patients. Half of ten patients, negative for anti-HCV, had detectable viremia by RT-nested-PCR, indicating that this technique should be used to confirm infections in this group of patients. The HCV genotype 1 was the most frequently observed, followed by the genotype 2, but no correlation was detected between genotype and clinical or epidemiological data."
5515,0.004,4.0,"Immunosuppression may be etiologic for some skin cancers. We investigated the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and solid-organ transplantation on skin cancer risk. We conducted a population-based case-control study among elderly U.S. adults (non-Hispanic whites, age 67 years or older), using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Medicare linked data. The study comprised 29,926 skin cancer cases (excluding basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas) and 119,704 controls, frequency-matched by gender, age and calendar year (1987-2002). Medicare claims identified solid-organ transplantation or HIV infection before cancer diagnosis/control selection. As negative controls, we evaluated other medical conditions (e.g., hypertension and depression) and cancers (breast, colon and prostate) not linked to immunosuppression. Odds ratios (ORs) compared prevalence in cases and controls, adjusted for matching factors and number of prior physician claims. Risks of Kaposi sarcoma (N = 602) and cutaneous non-Hodgkin lymphoma (N = 1,836) were increased with solid-organ transplantation (OR [95%CI]: 11.06 [5.27-23.23] and 2.27 [1.00-5.15], respectively) and HIV infection (21.58 [11.94-38.99] and 2.41 [1.05-5.52], respectively). Solid-organ transplantation was also associated with increased risks of Merkel cell carcinoma (N = 1,286; OR [95%CI] 4.95 [2.62-9.34]) and other cutaneous sarcomas (N = 972; 4.19 [1.83-9.56]). Solid-organ transplantation was nonsignificantly associated with melanoma (N = 23,974; (OR 1.36 [95%CI 0.98-1.88]). Null or weak associations were observed for negative control medical conditions and cancers. Solid-organ transplantation and HIV infection were followed by increased risk for some skin cancer subtypes among elderly adults. These results highlight the potential role of immunity in development of skin cancers."

Recent studies suggest psychosocial risk factors have important prognostic significance in HIV disease. The objective of the present study was to examine the prognostic influence of age, general intellectual functioning, and emotional distress across the spectrum of HIV disease progression. The study sample was drawn from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a 13-year, prospective study of HIV-seropositive men recruited from four study centers across the country. The participants were 1,231 HIV-seropositive MACS participants, followed from baseline (median 8/15/87) to the end of the observation period (12/15/98). HIV disease progression was evaluated with respect to three outcome measures: (1) number of years from baseline testing to the first AIDS defining illness (progression to AIDS), (2) years from baseline to HIV-dementia (progression to dementia), and (3) years from baseline to death (survival). The influence of psychosocial risk factors on outcome measures was evaluated using survival analyses. General intellectual functioning, age, and somatic symptoms of depression, were found to be significant predictors of HIV disease progression and survival. Older age at baseline was associated with a more rapid progression to dementia and death. Lower Shipley IQ estimates were associated with a more rapid disease progression (AIDS and dementia) and shortened survival. Somatic symptoms of depression were associated with shortened survival. In addition, age, IQ, and somatic symptoms of depression, had an additive effect with an increase in the number of risk factors associated with accelerated disease progression and shortened time to death. These findings remained consistent, despite controlling for baseline CD4 and HIV medication use. Psychosocial cofactors are important in understanding HIV disease progression. Methods for estimating HIV prognosis may become more reliable if psychosocial factors are considered. Future research will clarify if psychosocial risk factors reflect central nervous system integrity, brain reserve capacity or mediate morbidity and mortality through social economic status, access to health care and other social correlates."
6138,0.004,4.0,"The rate at which immunodeficiency develops in untreated human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1)-infected persons might be increasing or decreasing over time because of viral evolution or other factors. Beginning in 1984, Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study investigators recruited HIV-1-seronegative homosexual/bisexual men from four US metropolitan areas and examined them semiannually for HIV-1 seroconversion. To assess possible secular changes in the natural history of HIV-1 infection, the authors examined CD4+ lymphocyte data from 354 men who seroconverted between 1984 and 1991. To control for measurement differences among centers and over time, the authors adjusted CD4+ lymphocyte values to those of persistently seronegative participants. CD4+ lymphocyte percentage measurements at the first seropositive visit formed a U-shaped pattern, with the lowest values observed in 1988 and 1989. The authors observed no consistent secular pattern of CD4+ percentages at later visit dates, except that mean CD4+ percentages were consistently lowest in men who seroconverted in 1988. In a proportional hazards model, the time to the adjusted CD4+ lymphocyte count of < 500 cells/mm3 was not associated with the secular time of seroconversion (relative hazard = 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.97-1.13). The authors' data do not suggest a major change in the natural history of HIV-1 infection of this population."
1551,0.004,4.0,"This exploratory analyses characterizes patterns of lymphocyte recovery in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and investigates their relationship with baseline indices and virologic responses. We modeled kinetics of total CD4+ lymphocytes, as well as naive (CD45RA+ CD62L+), and memory (CD45RA- CD45RO+) subsets in 48 patients treated with AZT/3TC/Ritonavir for 48 weeks in ACTG protocol 315. Cell kinetic indices were estimated by nonlinear regression methods and were correlated with baseline factors and virologic responses. Five different kinetic patterns were identified, including biphasic growth, growth-plateau, growth-depletion, decay-recovery, and biphasic decay. Although overall mean lymphocyte responses showed a biphasic increase in cell number, a careful investigation reveals that only one-third of patients actually followed the biphasic growth pattern in CD4+ cell response, while 44% of 48 patients from this study followed the growth-depletion pattern. CD4+ cell recovery during the first phase and the 48-week study period were negatively correlated with baseline CD4+ cell counts, and positively correlated with baseline viral load. Memory CD4+ cell recovery during the first phase was also negatively correlated with baseline memory CD4+ and total CD4+ cell number, but the recovery rate of memory CD4+ cells during the second phase was positively correlated with baseline CD4+ cell number. Patients with a decay in CD4+ cell count during treatment were more likely to have experienced virological rebound (58%) than patients with nondecay patterns (24%). The rate and magnitude of the absolute increase in total CD4+ and memory CD4+ cell number (but not naive CD4+ cells) during the second phase were lower in patients with viral rebound compared with patients with persistent viral suppression. These results show that the kinetics of lymphocyte reconstitution in response to potent antiretroviral therapy in individual patients vary considerably from the ""classic"" biphasic increase that characterizes the mean or median response pattern. Pattern analysis of lymphocyte kinetics may be useful for testing relationships among factors that modulate the response to treatment."
3877,0.004,4.0,"Twenty-six antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), targeting five different steps in the life cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), have been approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Accordingly, HIV-1 phenotypic assays based on common cloning technology currently employ three, or possibly four, different recombinant viruses. Here, we describe a system to assess HIV-1 resistance to all drugs targeting the three viral enzymes as well as viral assembly using a single patient-derived, chimeric virus. Patient-derived p2-INT (gag-p2/NCp7/p1/p6/pol-PR/RT/IN) products were PCR amplified as a single fragment (3,428 bp) or two overlapping fragments (1,657 bp and 2,002 bp) and then recombined into a vector containing a near-full-length HIV-1 genome with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae uracil biosynthesis gene (URA3) replacing the 3,428 bp p2-INT segment (Dudley et al., Biotechniques 46:458-467, 2009). P2-INT-recombinant viruses were employed in drug susceptibility assays to test the activity of protease (PI), nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase (NRTI), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI), and integrase strand-transfer (INSTI) inhibitors. Using a single standardized test (ViralARTS HIV), this new technology permits the rapid and automated quantification of phenotypic resistance for all known and candidate antiretroviral drugs targeting all viral enzymes (PR, RT, including polymerase and RNase H activities, and IN), some of the current and potential assembly inhibitors, and any drug targeting Pol or Gag precursor cleavage sites (relevant for PI and maturation inhibitors) This novel assay may be instrumental (i) in the development and clinical assessment of novel ARV drugs and (ii) to monitor patients failing prior complex treatment regimens."
4954,0.004,4.0,"Patients with inherited bleeding disorders who received clotting factor concentrates before 1987 have high rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HCV/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. To determine whether the persistent nature of HIV affects the genetic diversity of HCV by less selective pressure through the immunosuppression of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, both the change of genetic diversity and selective pressure were examined in the HCV envelope genes (E1 and E2) of 325 genotype 1a subclones from eight HIV-positive and five HIV-negative patients with two time points (more than 6 years apart). To infer the genetic diversity of HCV in each patient, we used two approaches. One method was to estimate the difference of total evolutionary distances in the phylogenetic tree between the two time points, and another was to estimate the changes of genetic diversity along the time based on the coalescence theory. The two results indicate that the HIV-positive group has significantly more diverse population structure than the HIV-negative group. A comparative analysis of the synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions found that the HIV-positive group was subject to less selective pressure than the HIV-negative group. In conclusion, HIV-positive patients would have a more diversified HCV population than HIV-negative patients due to less selective pressure from the immune system."

4345,0.004,4.0,"To examine the prevalence, quantification, and factors that influence HIV in the cell-free compartment of breast milk, we performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on samples obtained from HIV-1-infected study subjects. Virus was detected in 86 of 136 samples (63.2%) from 79 study subjects. HIV RNA quantity ranged from undetectable to 227,586 copies/ml. Prevalence and mean viral load were not affected by postnatal ages or maternal vitamin A supplementation. Among study subjects with multiple samples, breast milk viral load did not change at different postnatal ages. Breast milk viral load correlated positively with plasma viral load (r = 0.47; p =.005) and negatively with maternal CD4 count at entry to the study (r = -0.26; p =.02). Mothers of HIV-infected children had a higher proportion of detectable HIV RNA in their breast milk than mothers of uninfected children (p =.03) and higher mean log10 HIV RNA quantities (p =.04). In a multivariate logistic regression model, log10 HIV RNA quantity in breast milk was significantly associated with the risk of mother-child transmission (odds ratio [OR], 2.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-6.51). Thus, prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections and of mastitis and early weaning may be important elements of a public health policy that is relevant to women in developing countries with HIV infection. Where available, antiretrovirals may also have an impact on opportunistic infections and mastitis."
3856,0.004,4.0,"Because milk-borne transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diminishes the benefits of perinatal antiviral drug therapy in developing countries, we have developed a new strategy to prevent postnatal and, possibly, intrapartum virus transmission in a primate model. Eight neonatal rhesus macaques were exposed orally to pathogenic simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV); 4 neonates were then given intramuscular postexposure prophylaxis with 3 anti-HIV human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nMAbs) with potent cross-clade and cross-group neutralization activity. Untreated infants experienced high viral RNA levels and CD4(+) T-cell losses and died (median survival time, 5.5 weeks). In contrast, all 4 nMAb-treated neonates were protected from infection (P=.028); their plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and lymph nodes remained virus negative for >1 year. These data are important for designing clinical trials in human neonates and have general implications for AIDS vaccine development, as the epitopes recognized by the 3 nMAbs are conserved among diverse primary isolates."
7725,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne pathogen that has a worldwide distribution and infects millions of people. Care-associated HCV infections represented a huge part of hepatitis C burden in the past via contaminated blood and unsafe injections and continue to be a serious problem of public health. The present review proposes a panorama of health care-associated HCV infections via the three mode of contamination that have been identified: (1) infected patient to non-infected patient; (2) infected patient to non-infected health care worker (HCW); and (3) infected HCW to non infected patient. For each condition, the circumstances of contamination are described together with the means to prevent them. As a whole, the more important risk is represented by unsafe practices regarding injections, notably with the improper use of multidose vials used for multiple patients. The questions of occupational exposures and infected HCWs are also discussed. In terms of prevention and surveillance, the main arm for combating care-associated HCV infections is the implementation of standard precautions in all the fields of cares, with training programs and audits to verify their good application. HCWs must be sensitized to the risk of blood-borne pathogens, notably by the use of safety devices for injections and good hygiene practices in the operating theatre and in all the invasive procedures. The providers performing exposed-prone procedures must monitor their HCV serology regularly in order to detect early any primary infection and to treat it without delay. With the need to stay vigilant because HCV infection is often a hidden risk, it can be hoped that the number of people infected by HCV via health care will decrease very significantly in the next years.

3901,0.004,4.0,"Infants born to HIV-1-infected mothers in resource-limited areas where replacement feeding is unsafe and impractical are repeatedly exposed to HIV-1 throughout breastfeeding. Despite this, the majority of infants do not contract HIV-1 postnatally, even in the absence of maternal antiretroviral therapy. This suggests that immune factors in breast milk of HIV-1-infected mothers help to limit vertical transmission. We compared the HIV-1 envelope-specific breast milk and plasma antibody responses of clade C HIV-1-infected postnatally transmitting and nontransmitting mothers in the control arm of the Malawi-based Breastfeeding Antiretrovirals and Nutrition Study using multivariable logistic regression modeling. We found no association between milk or plasma neutralization activity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or HIV-1 envelope-specific IgG responses and postnatal transmission risk. While the envelope-specific breast milk and plasma IgA responses also did not reach significance in predicting postnatal transmission risk in the primary model after correction for multiple comparisons, subsequent exploratory analysis using two distinct assay methodologies demonstrated that the magnitudes of breast milk total and secretory IgA responses against a consensus HIV-1 envelope gp140 (B.con env03) were associated with reduced postnatal transmission risk. These results suggest a protective role for mucosal HIV-1 envelope-specific IgA responses in the context of postnatal virus transmission. This finding supports further investigations into the mechanisms by which mucosal IgA reduces risk of HIV-1 transmission via breast milk and into immune interventions aimed at enhancing this response."
9671,0.004,4.0,"Even though potent antiretrovirals are available against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, therapy fails in a significant fraction of patients. Among the most relevant reasons for treatment failure are drug toxicity and side effects, but also the development of viral resistance towards the drugs applied. Efflux by ATP-binding cassette (ABC-) transporters represents one major mechanism influencing the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs and particularly their distribution, thus modifiying the concentration within the infected cells, that is, at the site of action. Moreover, drug-drug interactions may occur at the level of these transporters and modulate their activity or expression thus influencing the efficacy and toxicity of the substrate drugs. This review summarizes current knowledge on the interaction of antiretrovirals used for HIV-1 therapy with ABC-transporters and highlights the impact of ABC-transporters for cellular resistance and therapeutic success. Moreover, the suitability of different cell models for studying the interaction of antiretrovirals with ABC-transporters is discussed."

The association of HPV16 and 18 variant lineages with race, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, CD4+ T-cell count, HIV-RNA level, time-to-clearance of HPV infection and presence of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) among women in the Women's Interagency HIV Study was studied. Subjects were followed semi-annually with Pap smear and cervicovaginal lavage (CVL). HPV DNA was detected in CVLs using MY09/11 L1 PCR assay. Specimens positive for HPV16/18 underwent E6 PCR and sequencing to determine the variant present. Specimens from 195 HPV16- and 162 HPV18-positive women were classified into variant lineages based on sequencing results. African variants of HPV16 and HPV18 were significantly more prevalent among African-Americans than among Caucasians [42 versus 14 % (P=0.001) and 60 versus 13 % (P<0.001), respectively]. However, it was not possible to detect associations between the HPV16 or 18 variant lineages and other factors studied. African variants of HPV16/18 were more common in women of African descent living outside Africa, which could reflect mixing behaviours and/or immunogenetic factors. However, in a large population of HIV-infected women, the variant of HPV16 or 18 was unrelated to persistence of infection or presence of SIL. If non-European variants are more oncogenic, the effect may involve a late stage in cervical tumorigenesis."
6793,0.004,4.0,"A survey was carried out on a random sample of GPs in the city of Marseille. 18.5% had been involved during the past year in a regular follow-up of HIV patients. They were in charge with 79.8% of all ambulatory care of HIV+ patients. Those informally 'specialized' professionals were connected to health networks (not only hospital structures but also associations dealing with commitment in care). Socio-biographical factors, training and environmental opportunities and ideological orientations would positively relate with commitment in care. GPs who were not involved with care, would worry more about personal risk of contamination; would not believe that wearing gloves could be a sufficient protection when doing invasive procedures; would feel less at ease with HIV patients, would be more strongly in favor of coercive measures with IVDU's. Most GP's would agree to avoid drug users HIV+ patients. They would attribute to them more guilt and responsibility than to other patients. Uncertainty concerning relevant knowledge, negative attitudes towards some patients like IVDU's and anticipated difficulties to deal with ethical and relational dilemmas keep limiting GPs interest and positive motivation in care for HIV patients."

However, differential susceptibility in institutionalized populations suggest that HCV infection is even more prevalent in prison populations than previously reported yet, routine screening for HCV infection among prisoners is not generally available. We estimated the HCV prevalence and identified associated exposures at two maximum-security prisons using data obtained from 2788 inmates from the Risk Factors for Spread of Staphylococcus aureus in Prisons Study in New York, which recruited participants from January 2009 and January 2013. HCV prevalence was 10.1% (n=295); injection drug use, injection drug use sex partners, and HIV diagnosis exhibited the strongest associations with HCV infection in multivariable models, adjusting for covariates. Taken together, the findings of the present study provide an updated estimate of HCV prevalence and suggest that incarcerated populations represent a declining yet significant portion of the hepatitis epidemic.

3820,0.004,4.0,"Multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains with reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations at codons A62-->V, V75-->I, F77-->L, F116-->Y, and Q151-->M have been reported in patients receiving combination therapy with zidovudine (AZT) and didanosine (ddI). Infectious clones with each mutation alone, all five mutations together, and various combinations of mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation Q151-->M conferred partial resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine, whereas a combination of four mutations conferred increased resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine. The positions of residues 75, 77, and 151 in the three-dimensional crystal structure of HIV-1 RT suggest that these residues may affect the ability of the enzyme to discriminate between deoxynucleoside triphosphates and nucleoside analog RT inhibitors. Replication experiments showed that clones with mutation F77-->L but without V75-->I (HIV-1(77), HIV-1(77,151), and HIV-1(77,116,151) had attenuated growth compared with that of the original HIV-1NL4-3 strain and strains containing mutations at both positions 75 and 77 (HIV-1(75,77,151) and HIV-1(75,77,116,15)). Sequence analysis of viral RNA and proviral DNA from several patients indicated that RT mutations developed in a sequential and cumulative pattern over the course of a 2- to 4-year observation period. The present results suggest that drug resistance and viral replicative capacity both may play a role in selection of HIV-1 RT mutations."
3156,0.004,4.0,"Many individuals chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) experience a recrudescence of plasma virus during continuous combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) due either to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses or to poor compliance. In most cases, virologic failure on ART is associated with a coincident decline in CD4(+) T lymphocyte levels. However, a proportion of discordant individuals retain a stable or even increasing CD4(+) T lymphocyte count despite virological failure. In order to address the nature of these different outcomes, we evaluated virologic and immunologic variables in a prospective, single-blinded, nonrandomized cohort of 53 subjects with chronic HIV-1 infection who had been treated with continuous ART and monitored intensively over a period of 19 months. In all individuals with detectable viremia on ART, multiple drug resistance mutations with similar impacts on viral growth kinetics were detected in the pol gene of circulating plasma virus. Further, C2V3 env gene analysis demonstrated sequences indicative of CCR5 coreceptor usage in the majority of those with detectable plasma viremia. In contrast to this homogeneous virologic pattern, comprehensive screening with a range of antigens derived from HIV-1 revealed substantial immunologic differences. Discordant subjects with stable CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts in the presence of recrudescent virus demonstrated potent virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. In contrast, subjects with virologic failure associated with declining CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts had substantially weaker HIV-specific CD4(+) T lymphocyte responses and exhibited a trend towards weaker HIV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. Importantly the CD4(+) response was sustained over periods as long as 11 months, confirming the stability of the phenomenon. These correlative data lead to the testable hypothesis that the consequences of viral recrudescence during continuous ART are modulated by the HIV-specific cellular immune response."

2968,0.004,4.0,"Clinical observations suggest that chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in the Canadian Inuit are less often associated with serious adverse outcomes than has been described in other HBV-infected patient populations. The aim of this study was to document the clinical and biochemical features, liver-related morbidity and all-cause mortality in Canadian Inuit with chronic HBV infections. Administrative databases were reviewed for individuals identified as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive during a 1983-85 seroepidemiological survey of viral hepatitis in Baffin Island, Canada. An equal number of age- and gender-matched HBsAg-negative individuals from the same communities served as controls. Baseline HBV viral loads, genotypes and specific mutations were compared in HBsAg-positive survivors and nonsurvivors. A subset of surviving HBsAg-positive carriers were reassessed 25-30 years following their initial diagnosis for evidence of advanced liver disease and changes to their serological/virological findings. One hundred and forty four HBsAg-positive individuals were identified. All were Canadian Inuit. The mean age at diagnosis was 38 ± 17 years and 69 (61%) were male. Median follow-up was 23 years (range: 2-28 years). Viral quantitation from stored sera could be performed in 70 infected individuals. The median viral load was 4.3 log 10 IU/ml (range: 2.3-8.8 log 10 IU/ml), and all were genotype B, subgenotype B6. Liver biochemistry, morbidity and all-cause mortality rates were similar in HBsAg-positive carriers and controls. Following multivariate analyses, only age at diagnosis predicted mortality in HBsAg carriers. In a subset of 30 HBsAg-positive survivors who underwent follow-up assessments, clinical, biochemical and radiological examinations of the liver were essentially normal. 23/30 (77%) remained HBsAg positive and 17/19 (90%) HBV-DNA positive. The genotype and prevalence of genomic mutations in this cohort remained largely unchanged, but quantifiable viral loads were significantly lower (P < 0.003). The results of this study suggest that chronic HBV infections in the Canadian Inuit are infrequently associated with serious adverse outcomes. Whether this finding reflects unique features of the host, presence or absence of external factors that influence the course of HBV and/or intrinsic properties of the HBV B6 subgenotype remains to be determined."
7720,0.004,4.0,"This study was conducted in order to help determine the key factors that predict adherence to antiretroviral medications. A total of 115 HIV/AIDS patients who were having trouble adhering to their antiretroviral regimens completed face-to-face interviews in which adherence levels, medication side effects, mental health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics, substance use and health anxiety were assessed. Three measures of adherence were used: adherence over the past three days, adherence over the past week, and adherence over the past month. Logistic regression analyses indicated strongest prediction of three-day adherence, with mental health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics and side effects contributing to prediction. Past week adherence was associated with age and social support measures, and showed a marginal association with side effects. Past month adherence was less strongly predicted, with social support and alcohol use contributing to prediction. Thus, a variety of factors were found to determine adherence, and implications of the findings for adherence models and interventions are discussed."
4489,0.004,4.0,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with a high incidence of lymphoma. Typically, the lymphomas are B-cell in origin, and although they occur in the setting of HIV-1 infection, historical studies have found no evidence for the presence of HIV-1 within the transformed B-cells. We describe a new class of large cell lymphoma wherein HIV p24 expression within the tumor specimens was found to be extremely high. In the first case, HIV was expressed in the tumor-associated transformed T-cells. In three other cases, HIV was found to be highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages. These tumors exhibited a mixed immunophenotype histologically. Analysis by inverse polymerase chain reaction, using HIV long terminal repeat primers, demonstrated monoclonal HIV integration sites for all four tumors. Direct sequencing of the T-cell lymphoma inverse polymerase chain reaction products identified the HIV integration site within the fur gene, just upstream from the c-fes/fps protooncogene. Using segments of the fur gene as a probe, the other three monoclonal integration sites mapped to the same region. Although the integration and up-regulation of c-fes/fps was localized to the tumor cells within the T-cell lymphoma, the cells containing the monoclonal HIV in the other mixed immunophenotype lymphomas are currently unknown. These observations suggest that HIV may contribute directly to lymphomagenesis and identify a common site of HIV integration within a subset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome lymphoma."

Overall, spontaneous viral clearance rate is 10-25% and the only approach that can halt disease progression is hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication by means of antiviral therapy. In non-haemophilic patients a single nucleotide polymorphism located upstream the gene of interferon lambda 3 (IFNλ3) has been associated with both spontaneous viral clearance and sustained virological response after antiviral treatment. The aim of this study was to assess whether the rs12979860 polymorphism was a predictor of spontaneous viral clearance and of sustained virological response after antiviral therapy in a large cohort of haemophilic patients with HCV infection. The rs12979860 polymorphism, defined as CC genotype or T allele, was tested in a cohort of 342 haemophilic patients and evaluated as predictor of spontaneous clearance or response to antiviral therapy. By multivariate regression analysis the IFNλ3 CC genotype was an independent predictor of spontaneous viral clearance (odds ratio: 3.7, 95% confidence interval: 2.0-6.8). Sustained virological response rates were doubled in patients with the CC genotype than in those with the T allele (78% vs 44%; p<0.001), especially in patients with HCV type 1 (67% vs 32%; p<0.001) and higher sustained response rates were observed in patients with the CC genotype who did not achieve rapid virological response (61% vs 30% in T allele patients; p=0.006).

After 3 months of treatment, a significantly greater proportion of patients in group B (23/35, 65.7%) than in group A (8/28, 28.5%) showed a > or = 1 log10 decrease in the plasma HIV RNA level (P = 0.0034). However, after 9-12 months, 12 of 23 (52.1%) group B responders showed viral load rebound. The results were partially explained by the finding that, at baseline, the great majority (21/27, 77.7%) of group A patients showed mutations conferring resistance to all drugs administered, whereas in group B patients' susceptibility to at least two drug classes was retained. However, after 9-12 months of therapy, most (18/20, 90%) of the short-term responders in group B showed emergence of additional mutations that hampered long-term response."
9566,0.004,4.0,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become a major threat to the survival of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons in areas where antiretroviral therapy is available. In coinfection, viral eradication has been difficult to attain, and HCV therapy is underused. Novel therapies may be particularly beneficial for this population, yet studies lag behind those for HCV monoinfection. Increasingly, incident HCV among HIV-infected men who have sex with men is associated with sexual risk behavior further research should be performed to refine understanding of the causal mechanism of this association. The phenomenon of aggressive hepatic fibrogenesis when HIV infection precedes HCV acquisition requires longer-term observation to ensure optimal timing of HCV therapy. Medical management in coinfection will be improved by enhancing HCV detection, with annual serologic testing, screening with HCV RNA to detect acute infection, and HIV testing of HCV-infected individuals; by addressing HCV earlier in coinfected persons; and by universal consideration for HCV therapy. HCV drug trials in individuals coinfected with HIV should be expedited. HIV/HCV coinfection remains a growing and evolving epidemic; new developments in therapeutics and improved care models offer promise."

The HL-60 promyelocytic/myeloblastic cell line and the promonocytic line, U937, were susceptible to productive infection by monocytotropic HIV-1 isolates (HIV-1JR-FL and HTLV-IIIBa-L) after treatment with retinoic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, dibutyryl cAMP, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Virus production was only detected when these compounds were added before virus infection. Virus replication did not correlate with CD4 receptor expression because undifferentiated HL-60 cells express CD4 and the level of CD4 expression did not increase after differentiation in the presence of retinoic acid, 1,25(OH)2D3, or TPA. A mature monocytic cell line (THP-1) was capable of infection without pretreatment, and treatment with differentiating agents enhanced virus production. A chronically infected cell line (J-HL-60) was isolated after HIV-1JR-FL infection of HL-60 cells treated with retinoic acid. Virus production in this cell line was enhanced more than 10-fold after differentiation in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 or TPA. The majority of virus production by 1,25(OH)2D3-treated J-HL-60 cells was associated with the mature, adherent population. Molecular analysis of a cloned line of J-HL-60 showed integration of a single DNA provirus. These results suggest that cellular factors associated with precursor cell differentiation along the myelomonocytic pathway are required for optimal replication of monocytotropic HIV-1 strains in vitro."

After the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), these responses decay and the infected cell population that remains is commonly considered to be invisible to T-cells. We hypothesized that HIV antigen recognition may persist in ART-treated individuals due to low-level or episodic protein expression. We posited that if persistent recognition were occurring it would be preferentially directed against the early HIV gene products Nef, Tat, and Rev as compared to late gene products, such as Gag, Pol, and Env, which have higher barriers to expression. Using a primary cell model of latency, we observed that a Nef-specific CD8+ T-cell clone exhibited low-level recognition of infected cells prior to reactivation and robust recognition shortly thereafter. A Gag-specific CD8+ T-cell clone failed to recognized infected cells under these conditions, corresponding with a lack of detectable Gag expression. We measured HIV-specific T-cell responses in 96 individuals who had been suppressed on ART for a median of 7 years, and observed a significant, direct correlation between cell-associated HIV DNA levels and magnitudes of IFN-γ-producing Nef/Tat/Rev-specific T-cell responses. This correlation was confirmed in an independent cohort (n = 18). Correlations were not detected between measures of HIV persistence and T-cell responses to other HIV antigens. The correlation with Nef/Tat/Rev-specific T-cells was attributable to Nef-specific responses, the breadth of which also correlated with HIV DNA levels. These results suggest that ongoing Nef expression in ART-treated individuals drives preferential maintenance and/or expansion of T-cells reactive to this protein, implying sensing of infected cells by the immune system. The direct correlation, however, suggests that recognition does not result in efficient elimination of infected cells. These results raise the possibility that enhancing the cytolytic activity of Nef-specific T-cells may lead to reductions in infected cell frequencies, even in the absence of therapeutic latency reversal."
3996,0.004,4.0,"Non-detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope protein (hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg) in a chronically HBV infected individual has been described as occult infection. One possible reason for this phenotype is alteration in large (L-HBsAg) to small (S-HBsAg) envelope protein ratio associated with reduced or non secretion of HBsAg. This results in quantitative levels of serum HBsAg below the detection limit of enzyme immunoassays. Genotype D of HBV has a characteristic 33 nucleotide (nt) deletion upstream of the pre-S2/S promoter. This deletion may reduce HBsAg secretion in occult infection patients infected with genotype D HBV. Additional deletions in the pre-S2/S promoter may further aggravate reduced HBsAg secretion in patients infected with genotype D HBV. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the role of genotype D specific 33nt deletion and additional pre-S2/S promoter deletions in causing reduced or no secretion of HBsAg, in occult infection. Since these deletions overlap virus polymerase, their effect on virus replication was also investigated."

The World Health Organization projection model was used to make a short term projection of HIV infection and AIDS cases. Results show that the number estimated of HIV infected populations varies between 24 to 45,000 people by the year 1995. Results show also an estimated 8,500 cumulative AIDS cases.

1737,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are major causes of acute and chronic liver disease worldwide. Chronic infection with these viruses often leads to chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis or primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Both HBV and HCV are bloodborne viruses; however, HBV is transmitted efficiently by both percutaneous and mucosal exposures, and HCV is transmitted predominantly by percutaneous exposures. Because the relative importance of various modes of transmission of these viruses differs by country, the choice of specific prevention and control strategies depends primarily on the epidemiology of infection in a particular country. Comprehensive hepatitis B prevention strategies should include (1) prevention of perinatal HBV transmission, (2) hepatitis B vaccination at critical ages to interrupt transmission and (3) prevention of nosocomial HBV transmission. The prevention of hepatitis C is problematic because a vaccine to prevent HCV infection is not expected to be developed in the foreseeable future. From a global perspective, the greatest impact on the disease burden associated with HCV infection will most likely be achieved by focusing efforts on primary prevention strategies to reduce or eliminate the risk for transmission from nosocomial exposures (e.g. blood transfusion, unsafe injection practices) and high-risk practices (e.g. injecting drug use)."
7580,0.004,4.0,"The present study was designed to assess the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among hospital employees, who often contract the infection before the beginning of their employment, and to suggest a prevention strategy. The study population consisted of 2518 subjects working or studying at the two Hadassah University hospitals, on Mount Scopus and at Ein Kerem in Jerusalem. The total prevalence for anti-HBc positivity as an indicator for past or present HBV infection was 17.6%. Several variables, including country of birth, age, and duration of employment significantly affected the rate of anti-HBc positivity. The highest rates for anti-HBc+ were found in personnel of selected departments such as haemodialysis (31.8%), haematology/oncology (28.3%), and the blood bank (24.0%), after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex. Specific occupations in the hospital were associated with an increased rate of anti-HBc positivity. Thus the highest rate of HBV infection (after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex) was shown for housekeepers (32.4%) and departmental secretaries (23.6%), who take care of waste products containing blood, or who transfer vials containing blood to the hospital laboratories. By comparison, anti-HBc was positive in 17.2% of nurses, 15.6% of physicians, and only 7.8% of administrative clerks. Israel is a country of immigration, and anti-HBc rates were four times higher in employees born in countries where HBV is more endemic--for example, in north Africa and Mediterranean countries--than in employees born in western Europe or the United States. However, rate of anti-HBc + increased significantly with age as well as duration of employment in the hospital, irrespective of country of birth. These data indicate that although HBV infection often occurs in Israel before commencement of employment in the hospital, hospital employees are at significant risk for contracting HBV infection during their professional lifetime regardless of where they were born. Moreover, paramedical personnel such as housekeepers and departmental secretaries are in the highest risk group for contracting HBV. Finally, as a result of the high background of anti-HBC positivity in selected ethnic groups, mandatory screening for anti-HBc before employment in medical institutions in Israel is recommended for them, then active vaccination against HBV for employees at risk. Employees who immigrated from western Europe and the United States should be immunised without pre-vaccination screening for HBV."
20,0.004,4.0,"Despite the success of combined antiretroviral therapy in controlling viral replication in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, commonly referred to as neuroAIDS, remain a frequent and poorly understood complication. Infection of CD8(+) lymphocyte-depleted rhesus macaques with the SIVmac251 viral swarm is a well-established rapid disease model of neuroAIDS that has provided critical insight into HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder onset and progression. However, no studies so far have characterized in depth the relationship between intra-host viral evolution and pathogenesis in this model. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) env gp120 sequences were obtained from six infected animals. Sequences were sampled longitudinally from several lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, including individual lobes within the brain at necropsy, for four macaques; two animals were sacrificed at 21 days post-infection (p.i.) to evaluate early viral seeding of the brain. Bayesian phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses of the sequence data were used to ascertain viral population dynamics and gene flow between peripheral and brain tissues, respectively. A steady increase in viral effective population size, with a peak occurring at ~50-80 days p.i., was observed across all longitudinally monitored macaques. Phylogeographic analysis indicated continual viral seeding of the brain from several peripheral tissues throughout infection, with the last migration event before terminal illness occurring in all macaques from cells within the bone marrow. The results strongly supported the role of infected bone marrow cells in HIV/SIV neuropathogenesis. In addition, our work demonstrated the applicability of Bayesian phylogeography to intra-host studies in order to assess the interplay between viral evolution and pathogenesis. "
6487,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and its associated diseases continue to increase despite the progress in our understanding of HIV biology and the availability of a number of antiretroviral drugs. Adherence is a significant factor in the success of HIV therapy and current HIV treatment regimens require a combination of antiviral drugs to be taken at least daily for the remainder of a patient's life. A drug delivery system that allows sustained drug delivery could reduce the medical burden and costs associated with medication nonadherence. Here, we describe a novel supramolecular assembly or matrix that contains an anionic polymer hyaluronic acid, cationic polymer poly-l-lysine, and anionic oligosaccharide sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin. HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors Zidovudine and Lamivudine were successfully encapsulated into the polymer assembly in a noncovalent manner. The physicochemical properties and antiviral activity of the polymer assemblies were studied. The results of this study suggest that the supramolecular assemblies loaded with HIV drugs exert potent antiviral activity and allow sustained drug release. A novel drug delivery formulation such as the one described here could facilitate our efforts to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infections and could be utilized in the design of therapeutic approaches for other diseases."

In fact, a proportion of people with sexual exposure to HIV remain uninfected despite multiple and continuous intercourse with HIV-infected partners. In this work, we have analyzed those virologic parameters potentially involved in the transmission of HIV through heterosexual contact. Thirty-eight couples with continuous unprotected sexual intercourse were included. HIV transmission occurred in 10 of 38 couples. No differences in clinical characteristics, exposure time, sexual practices, CD4 counts, or polymorphism in CCR5 were found between transmitter and nontransmitter groups. In contrast, virologic data were different between both groups; median values of viral load were 21.139 and 5.484 RNA copies/ml of plasma in the transmitter and nontransmitter groups, respectively, and a significant difference was found in mean viral load values (p = .03, Mann-Whitney test). Viral isolation was obtained in 90% of transmitters, but in only 44% of nontransmitter subjects (p = .02, Fisher's exact test). These data show that viral load levels and a positive viral isolation in culture must be considered as risk factors for heterosexual transmission of HIV-1."

295,0.004,4.0,"The emergence of resistance to lamivudine has been one of the major stumbling blocks to successful treatment and control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. The major mechanism of resistance has been attributed to the alteration in the YMDD motif of the HBV polymerase due to an amino acid change of rtM204 to V/I and an accompanying rtL180M conversion. A novel mutation pattern in a patient having clinical breakthrough under lamivudine therapy was discovered. The mutant had a rtL180C/M204I genotype and was detected after 2 years of therapy with lamivudine. To characterize this novel variant, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a vector construct containing the HBV genome. Transient transfection studies in human hepatoma cells with HBV carrying the new mutant demonstrated that the rtL180C/M204I mutant was resistant to lamivudine up to 10 microM. The resistance profile was comparable to that of the previously reported rtL180 M/M204I-containing virus. These observations were further confirmed by generation of stable cultures transfected with the mutant virus."

Postnatal growth failure and microcephaly, observed in a significant proportion of patients (46.7% and 30%, respectively), could be attributed to chronic illnesses and to progressive central nervous system lesions in HIV-infected patients. There were however, no significant differences between patients and controls with regard to the incidence of craniofacial features and dermatoglyphics, and the incidence of other anomalies was not different from that expected in the population. The patients born to drug-using mothers were not different from those born to non-drug-using mothers in relation to the studied criteria. We could not confirm the presence of characteristic craniofacial dysmorphism in children exposed to perinatal HIV infection."

4622,0.004,4.0,"The HIV epidemic is a significant global health care issue. With increasing knowledge and improved therapeutics the natural history of the infection has been modified. In this paper we aim to present the general socio-demographic profile and the clinical and therapeutic spectrum of patients with HIV infection who have visited the Bayamón Health Care facilities over the last 12 years and who are part of the Retrovirus Research Center (RRC). The objectives of the study are: 1) describe changes in the demographic, risk factors and clinical stage of patients with HIV infection initially seen in our center; 2) assess changing trends from the clinical and immunological perspective across time; 3) describe mortality risk of patients particularly after the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART). This is a cross-sectional study of 3,569 patients admitted to the RRC at the Universidad Central del Caribe between years 1992 through 2005. The variables studied were demographic, risk factors exposure, HIV status at baseline, clinical and immunological parameters, ART and the mortality risk. Chi square with Cramer's coefficient, Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazard ratio analysis were performed. The study revealed that individuals presenting at our health care facilities are older and that the proportion of females has increased. The risk factor profile shows increase in heterosexual contact with the disease. The study found that patients treated with ART had significantly lower mortality risk than those without ART. Patients who arrive to RRC with AIDS and Intravenous Drug Users (IDU) had a higher mortality risk than participants with HIV. The analysis of the trends showed changes in the demographic and clinical profile of patients across the years.

Isolates of C. albicans were obtained from 45 patients with HIV infection during the progression of their disease and differentiated using two methods. The first utilized the morphological characteristics of colonies, and the second method utilized a small portion of C. albicans DNA as a probe on Southern-transferred, EcoRI-digested C. albicans genomic DNA. In 67% of the patients a single strain of C. albicans, as determined by the DNA analysis, was isolated from each individual. The phenotypic expression of the genetically identical strains varied considerably over the experimental period with one morphotype being predominant. These results showed that the genotype of C. albicans persisted in the majority of HIV-infected individuals, but that the phenotypical expression of this strain changed. A novel finding in this study was that 18 strains of C. albicans had DNA which did not hybridize to the probe used."
9965,0.004,4.0,"HCV and HIV co-infection is associated with accelerated hepatic fibrosis progression and higher rates of liver decompensation and death compared to HCV monoinfection, and liver disease is a leading cause of non-AIDS-related mortality among HIV-infected patients. New insights have revealed multiple mechanisms by which HCV and HIV lead to accelerated disease progression, specifically that HIV infection increases HCV replication, augments HCV-induced hepatic inflammation, increases hepatocyte apoptosis, increases microbial translocation from the gut and leads to an impairment of HCV-specific immune responses. Treatment of HIV with antiretroviral therapy and treatment of HCV have independently been shown to delay the progression of fibrosis and reduce complications from end-stage liver disease among co-infected patients. However, rates of sustained virologic response with PEG-IFN and ribavirin have been significantly inferior among co-infected patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients, and treatment uptake has remained low given the limited efficacy and tolerability of current HCV regimens. With multiple direct-acting antiviral agents in development to treat HCV, a unique opportunity exists to redefine the treatment paradigm for co-infected patients, which incorporates data on fibrosis stage as well as potential drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy.

2873,0.004,4.0,"The HAART therapy has improved life expectancy enabling long latency conditions caused by the hepatitis viruses that became the leading cause of death in HIV infected patients. In this study a group of 300 patients aged from 18 to 63 years were selected in order to assess the prevalence and consequences of HIV and the hepatitis B (HBV), C (HCV) and D (HDV) viruses coinfections. Study groups were designed for each coinfection. These groups were in turn divided in case groups formed of coinfected participants and control groups consisting of mono-infected participants. This classification was obtained by testing the participants for the presence of specific infection markers using the ELISA technique. As a result, in regard to the HIV/HBV coinfection the study group consisted of 16 coinfected participants and 114 HBV-infected participants resulting in a prevalence of the coinfection of 14%. In the case of the HIV/HDV coinfection the study group consisted of 5 coinfected participants and 45 HDV-infected participants. The prevalence of the HIV/HCV coinfection was 25% out of the 170 HCV-infected participants. The effect of the coinfections on the expression and levels of the infection markers was analyzed in constrast to those encountered in the case of the mono-infection. The observed changes in the expression of the specific hepatitis markers indicate the impact of the coinfection with HIV on the progression of the hepatitis infections. In addition, the inadequate immune response towards the hepatitis viruses in the case of the coinfected participants leads to the development of cirrhosis and end stage liver disease."

Initially described in patients treated with SMX-TMP for PCP, allergy is now known to involve a multitude of drugs. The pathogenesis of, and risk factors for, allergy in HIV infection are poorly understood, although there is evidence suggesting that allergy is more common with advancing immunodeficiency. HIV-negative subjects with sulfonamide allergy may have drug-specific antibodies and drug metabolite-induced lymphocyte cytotoxicity, abnormalities that could partly explain the allergic mechanisms and which may have future diagnostic potential; these abnormalities have not been described in HIV-infected subjects. Therapy includes avoidance, suppressive agents such as corticosteroids, and desensitization, although the appropriate role for each is not entirely clear. Serum IgE levels have been shown to rise with progressive disease; those patients with higher levels may have a worse prognosis. The mechanisms of this rise are multifactorial, probably a combination of altered T-lymphocyte regulation of IgE synthesis and of production of specific IgE directed against microbial antigens."

We assessed 244 HIV-positive participants in an HIV intervention targeting drug users (1997-99). Fifty-seven per cent of HIV-positive participants reported unprotected sex within the past 90 days, 16.4% with serodiscordant partners. Odds of risky sex were lower among those currently receiving HIV medical care (odds ratio (OR)=0.36), and were greater among females (OR=2.6), those having friends with lower norms of condom use (OR=3.3), and those having a main sexual partner (OR=6.2). Lower odds of receiving HIV medical care were associated with current drug use (OR=0.33), sharing drugs with a sex partner (OR=0.27), and exchanging sex for drugs or money (OR=0.24).

Six men had high rates of CD4+ T-cell loss, and eight men had low rates of CD4+ T-cell loss over 2.5 to 8 years of infection. We found that V1-V2 and V4-V5 env populations changed dramatically over time in all 14 subjects; the changes in these regions were significantly correlated with each another over time. The subjects with rapid CD4 loss had significantly less change in their env populations than the subjects with slow CD4 loss. The two subjects with rapid CD4 loss and sustained low CD4 counts (<150/microl for at least 2 years) showed stabilization of their V1-V2 and V4-V5 populations as reflected by low levels of total change in HTA pattern and low HTA indices (a novel measure of the emergence of new bands and band distribution); this stabilization was not observed in other subjects. The stabilization of env variant populations at low CD4 counts following periods of rapid viral evolution suggests that selective pressure on env, likely from new immune responses, is minimal when CD4 counts drop dramatically and remain low for extended periods of time."

This study compares the level of satisfaction of physicians reporting their experience with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) testing with the satisfaction levels of those physicians reporting their experience with hepatitis B virus (HBV) testing. By mail, 6,570 licensed San Diego County physicians were surveyed. Among those who tested for HIV-1 or HBV, their satisfaction with four different HIV-1 or HBV testing parameters was assessed: 1) specimen submission process, 2) test accuracy, 3) clarity of test report, and 4) turnaround time. Overall, physician satisfaction with both HIV-1 and HBV testing was high, particularly for test accuracy (means of 2.79 and 2.84, respectively on a 3-point scale), although slightly lower for turnaround time (means of 2.40 and 2.43, respectively). Mean satisfaction with the specimen submission process and test accuracy were higher for physicians who ordered HBV tests than for those who ordered HIV-1 tests. Satisfaction with the four HIV-1 testing process parameters varied significantly by physician specialty, practice type, and type of laboratory used. For HBV testing, significant differences were observed only for turnaround time. For both HIV-1 and HBV testing, those who received a final interpretation of laboratory results were more satisfied with test report clarity than those who did not. Although physician satisfaction with HIV-1 and HBV testing is high, this study identifies the least satisfied groups and specific areas in the testing process than may need improvement."

We present the largest survey on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resistance among treatment-naïve and experienced patients followed in small, relatively underprivileged cities in Brazil with universal availability to standard of care antiretroviral combinations. Samples were collected between 2004 and 2006 from 95 patients followed in the cities of Saquarema and Santo Antonio de Pádua, state of Rio de Janeiro. A proviral fragment encompassing protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) regions was generated and drug susceptibility level was inferred. Among 50 strains from drug-naïve subjects, one (2%) had intermediate-level resistance to RT inhibitors. Among 38 patients on therapy as of sampling, 28 (73.7%) had plasma viral load (PVL) below detection limit (26 of whom without evidence of resistance mutations) and 11 (28.9%) harbored strains with reduced susceptibility. Only two strains harbored both protease and RT inhibitor mutations. Among seven patients who were off-treatment as of sampling, two (28.5%) harbored strains with reduced susceptibility to RT inhibitors. The relatively high frequency of undetectable PVL among patients on treatment and the overall low prevalence of resistance-associated mutations are reassuring.

Production was detected by using an HIV p24 antigen ELISA assay in blood mononuclear cells in 54% of asymptomatic, 71% of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex, and 100% of AIDS patients. When the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated into monocytes and CD4+ T cells, we found that the CD4+ T-cell fraction was preferentially infected in the three clinical stages. The ability to isolate HIV from blood monocyte-derived macrophages was similar in the three stages (24-33%) and required coculture with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphoblasts. Bone marrow and blood mononuclear cells cultured simultaneously yielded virus from both sources in 13 individuals. Again the prime source of virus was the nonadherent bone marrow mononuclear cells, which contained CD4+ T cells, and not the adherent monocyte-enriched fraction. We conclude that blood mononuclear cells yield productive virus more readily as disease progresses and that infection is detected in association with CD4+ T-cell-enriched fractions. In our large sample of patients, monocyte infection was detected in only a small fraction, suggesting that this cell type is neither a primary nor an exclusive reservoir of HIV infection."

Random multistage cluster sampling was used to select persons 13-69 years of age. Markers for HBV were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The HBV genotypes were determined by sequencing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Multivariate analyses and simple catalytic model were performed. Overall, 7,881 persons were included; < 70% were not vaccinated. Positivity for HBsAg was less than 1% among non-vaccinated persons and genotypes A, D, and F co-circulated. The incidence of infection increased with age with similar force of infection in all regions. Males and persons having initiated sexual activity were associated with HBV infection in the two settings; healthcare jobs and prior hospitalization were risk factors in the Federal District.

We performed UDPS on reverse transcriptase (RT) from 47 HIV-1 individuals, naive of antiretroviral treatment and for whom genotypic resistance testing was requested for clinical management in 2011-2012. In 8.5% of the patients, only low-frequency variants harboring RT drug resistance mutations were detected raising the question of their clinical significance.

Assessments included patient-reported Medication Adherence Self-Report Inventory, SF-12v2 Quality of Life assessment, HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, and HIV Symptom Index Questionnaire through Week 48. Additional evaluations included study drug discontinuations due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). A total of 786 participants (n=394 RPV/FTC/TDF, n=392 EFV/FTC/TDF) were included. Fewer RPV/FTC/TDF-treated than EFV/FTC/TDF-treated participants discontinued study drug due to TEAEs (2.5% vs. 8.7%), with 41% (14/34) TEAE-related discontinuations in the EFV/FTC/TDF group occurring within the first four weeks of treatment. Treatment adherence and satisfaction remained high through Week 48 and quality of life improved from baseline in both groups. There were no significant between-group differences in virologic success (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) regardless of adherence (<95% or ≥95%). Significant between-group differences favouring RPV/FTC/TDF were observed for the HIV SIQ symptoms of difficulty falling or staying asleep (p = .022) and diarrhea or loose bowel movements (p = .002). In conclusion, 48-week treatment with RPV/FTC/TDF or EFV/FTC/TDF was associated with high adherence, high treatment satisfaction, and improved quality of life. TEAE-related discontinuations and patient-reported symptoms indicate that RPV/FTC/TDF may be somewhat better tolerated than EFV/FTC/TDF. "
5437,0.004,4.0,"In Thailand, the combined generic anti-retroviral drug stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine (d4T/3TC/NVP) has been used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals since 2001. Due to relatively frequent adverse effects, d4T gradually has been replaced with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Although the frequency of adverse drug effects with TDF is lower than that with d4T, TDF is known to induce kidney dysfunction, especially in the proximal tubules. It has been reported that renal tubular transporters, including members of the multi-drug resistant (MDR) protein family, are implicated in tenofovir extrusion and may, therefore, confer susceptibility to TDF-induced kidney tubular dysfunction (KTD). We have explored the association between KTD and polymorphisms in genes that encode adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC)-type MDRs."
3107,0.004,4.0,"Population-wide variation in genomic RNA of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encompassing the V3 loop of the envelope protein was studied in serum samples of 74 newly infected individuals from three Dutch cohorts: 30 homosexual men, 32 drug users, and 12 hemophiliacs. During acute infection, HIV-1 RNA sequences present in serum are relatively homogeneous, which makes direct sequencing feasible. This offered an opportunity to study the infecting virus variants before mutations had accumulated in the new host. The sampling dates ranged from 1980 to 1991, thus spanning the entire AIDS epidemic in The Netherlands. The diversity in the sequenced region increased over time in both the homosexual and the drug-user risk groups. Furthermore, this increase was associated with an increase in antigenic variation, as witnessed by serum reactivity to a V3 peptide panel. Despite this diversification, some 1990 sequences still closely resembled the earliest 1980 sequence, making ancestral inferences problematic. No evidence was found of a change in the master sequence of the virus quasi-species over time. At the amino acid level, no risk-group-associated variation was found, but at the nucleotide level, the drug-user and homosexual/hemophiliac sequences could be distinguished on the basis of a single silent nucleotide change in the sequence encoding the tip of the V3 loop. Hemophiliac sequences could not be distinguished from those of homosexuals. In spite of the large and increasing genetic variability, all sequences were more similar to the European/American HIV consensus sequence than to that of non-Western strains."

The current study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of HBV infection and its associated risk factors among hemodialysis patients from five hemodialysis centers in Tabriz, a Northwestern Iranian city. Hepatitis B serologic markers were evaluated in chronic hemodialysis patients. Patients (n = 412) were divided into two groups: Group 1--patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Group 2--patients with negative HBsAg. The median age was 54.9 years (range, 13-90 years). Thirteen patients (3.2%) were found to be positive for HBsAg. Among the studied factors, the history of war injury was significantly associated with the risk of HBV infection (P = 0.023). In conclusion, our study shows that the risk of HBV infection among Tabrizian hemodialysis patients is a factor of dialysis-independent parameters."

A key factor in the effectiveness of ART is good adherence to the prescribed regimen for both individual well-being and public health. Poor adherence can contribute to the emergence of drug resistant strains of the virus and transmission during risky behaviors. Increased access to ART in low-income country settings has contributed to an interest in treatment adherence in resource-poor contexts. This study aims to investigate the proportion of adherence to ART and identify possible factors related to non-adherence to ART among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Lao PDR."
7586,0.004,4.0,"The aim of the study was to identify high-risk groups and the determinants of late HIV diagnosis in France in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), from January 1996 to June 2005. Informations were collected from an electronic medical record of all HIV- 1-infected patients who sought care in six HIV reference centers in France, constituting a prospective multicentric cohort. Patients were defined as ""late testers"" if they had presented with either symptoms of clinical AIDS or a CD4 cell count less than 200/mm(3) during the year of diagnosis, as ""nonlate"" if their CD4 count was above 200, and as ""unknown"" if CD4 cell count in the year at the time of diagnosis was not documented. Among the 4516 patients available for analysis, the percentage of late testing was 38% (n = 1718) and decreased after 2003 (31.5% in 2004-2005). This percentage was higher in heterosexual men (48.2%) than in homosexual men (31.7%) or heterosexual women (32.6%) and was higher for patients older than 30. Heterosexual men living in a couple with children had a higher risk of late testing (odds ratio [OR] = 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 2.66), while heterosexual women in a couple without children had a lower risk (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.83). Among homosexual men, unemployment was associated with late testing (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.14 to 4.36). The proportion of late testing was still high. Groups classically identified as low risk for HIV infection, particularly heterosexual men in a couple with children, were found to be at high risk for late testing. It seems necessary to improve HIV testing policy in the heterosexual population."

Therefore, it is important to know the attitudes of midwives' and nurses' towards people living with HIV/AIDS. The aim of this descriptive and cross-sectional study is to assess the attitudes of Turkish midwives and nurses working at hospitals to people living with HIV/AIDS and to identify factors that affect these attitudes. A group of 46 midwives and 192 nurses working in hospitals were included in the study. Data were collected through AIDS Attitude Scale. Age, professional experience, number of children and marital status influenced the attitudes of the participants towards people living with HIV/AIDS. We concluded that higher level of education appear to positively influence the attitudes of the participants. Education programmes including evidence-based nursing implications might be planned to improve positive attitudes and to prevent stigmatization of people living with HIV/AIDS."
8911,0.004,4.0,"To elucidate needlestick transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV), strains isolated from 1 physician who acquired HBV infection through a needlestick accident and 3 patients with chronic hepatitis B (donor patients A, B, and C) were tested using molecular evolutionary analysis based on full-length HBV genomic sequences. Nucleotide sequences of these isolates were aligned with 55 previously reported full-length genomic sequences. Genetic distances were estimated using the 6-parameter method, and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. Strains isolated from patient A and the recipient pair were clustered within a closer range of evolutionary distances than were strains recovered from the recipient pair and patients B and C. Furthermore, strains from patient A and the recipient were also clustered on the S gene sequences of HBV. These results demonstrated that patient A alone was the source of direct transmission to the recipient. This approach can be used to investigate the transmission route of HBV."
3809,0.004,4.0,"Occult Hepatitis B Infection (OBI) is a form of chronic HBV infection characterized by low level HBV DNA, without detectable HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). OBI is frequently associated with the presence of anti-HBc and in some cases also with anti-HBs. Patients, who formerly received non-inactivated factor concentrates, can potentially be considered at high risk for OBI, especially since these patients usually are HIV or HCV co-infected. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of occult HBV infection in Greek patients with hereditary bleeding disorders. The study sample comprised of 114 patients from a single haemophilia center. All patients were screened for HBV serum markers and individually tested for HBV DNA using a qualitative PCR. Presence of HBV DNA was further confirmed by quantification of viral load with an ultrasensitive in-house real time PCR. 88 and 21 patients with haemophilia A and B, respectively, 4 patients with von Willebrand Disease and 1 patient with severe factor VII deficiency were screened for the presence of OBI. Anti-HBc were detected in 53 (46.5%) subjects; 18 of them were anti-HBs(-) and 35 anti-HBs(+). Anti-HBe were present in 26 subjects. Two out of 114 patients were HBsAg(+). Of the remaining 112 HBsAg(-) patients tested, two (1.8%) were found HBsAg(-), HBV DNA(+), anti-HBc(+) and anti-HBs(-) and were identified as potential OBI cases. Both cases exhibited very low DNA levels; 38.2IU/mL in patient A and 14.2IU/mL in patient B. Both patients were HBeAg(-), but patient A had HBe antibodies. Patient B was also HIV/HCV co-infected. In conclusion, two cases of OBI with low HBV viraemia were identified among patients with congenital bleeding disorders. Although the incidence in our sample is moderately low (1.8%), close monitoring of these infections is of great clinical significance, especially in patients with co-infections and concomitant immunosuppression."
4771,0.004,4.0,"During 4 year period between April 1990 and March 1994, 4120 specimens from the patients attending out patient departments of Medical, Surgical and Antenatal units of a major city hospital were tested for HIV infection as a part of an on-going sentinel surveillance programme. In addition, 1440 specimens from the patients attending STD clinic of the same hospital and 862 females seeking termination of pregnancy from a near by hospital were included for comparison. It was found that only 3 individuals with high risk behaviours out of 2002 females attending antenatal clinic showed evidence of HIV infection (rate 1.49 per 1000). The corresponding rate for the group of patients attending STD clinic and seeking termination of pregnancy were 3 out of 1440 (rate 2.15 per 1000) and 1 out of 862 (rate 1.16 per 1000) respectively. It was noted that prevalence of HIV infection in the hospital attending population with unspecified risk factor (medical, surgical and antenatal clinics) was not a matter of serious concern. The importance of finding out risk factors in females attending antenatal clinic is evident from the study."

Thus, a therapy that specifically reduces HBsAg serum levels could be used in combination therapy with nucleos(t)ide drugs or permit therapeutic vaccination for the treatment of HBV infection. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel triazolo-pyrimidine inhibitors (1, 3, and 4) of HBsAg cellular secretion, with activity against drug-resistant HBV variants. Extensive SAR led to substantial improvements in the EC(50) of the parent compound, 5 (HBF-0259), with the best being 3c, with EC(50) = 1.4 ± 0.4 μM, SI ≥ 36. The lead candidates, both 1a (PBHBV-001) and 3c (PBHBV-2-15), were well-tolerated in both normal and HBV-transgenic mice and exhibited acceptable pharmacokinetics and bioavailability in Sprague-Dawley rats."
6962,0.004,4.0,"This study aimed to investigate the correlates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related discrimination among general practitioners. The survey, conducted in 1993-1994, covered a random sample of 878 general practitioners from six of the 12 New South Wales health areas, augmented by 44-general practitioners from the same areas who were antiretroviral drug prescribers. The response rate was 51 per cent, and the final usable sample was 451. Variables examined were: demographic characteristics, the number of HIV-infected patients, personal contact with people living with HIV or AIDS, personal contact with homosexuals, the degree of anxiety about HIV or AIDS, and the degree of HIV-related discrimination. Discriminatory attitudes among general practitioners decreased as contact with HIV-infected patients (P < 0.001), other people living with HIV or AIDS (P < 0.001), and homosexuals (P < 0.001) increased. Anxiety about HIV or AIDS also decreased as contact increased (P < 0.001). Higher levels of anxiety were strongly associated with higher levels of HIV-related discrimination (P < 0.001). The demographic correlates of discrimination among general practitioners were the same as those found in the wider population. The professional care of people living with HIV and AIDS was concentrated among a small number of general practitioners, many of whom were homosexual. Ten general practitioners were carrying extraordinarily high caseloads of over 200 HIV-infected patients each. Older, heterosexual and male general practitioners are an important target for education campaigns, and the professional care of people living with HIV or AIDS should be encouraged among a wider group of general practitioners."

In this study, the genotype frequency of two IL28B SNPs (rs129679860 and rs8099917) in a cohort of chronic HCV-monoinfected patients in Brazil was evaluated and the SNP sufficient to predict the treatment response outcome was determined. A total of 66 naïve genotype-1 chronic HCV-infected patients were genotyped and the associated viral kinetics and SVR were assessed. The overall SVR was 38%. Both the viral kinetics and SVR were associated with rs129679860 genotypes (CC = 62% vs. CT = 33% vs. TT = 18%, p = 0.016). However, rs8099917 genotypes were only associated with SVR (TT = 53% vs. TG = 33% vs. GG = 18%; p = 0.032).

This case-control study was carried out to detect whether apoptosis genes single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) confer risk to HCV in a cohort of Egyptian patients and to explore their association with viral load. One hundred and ninety six blood samples were withdrawn from 96 HCV patients and 100 controls. The Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) -1525G>A and FasL-844T>C SNPs were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Hepatitis C viral load was measured using Real time PCR. Results Genotypes distributions of TRAIL -1525G>A and FasL-844 T>C polymorphisms in controls were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). The study showed a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the TRAIL -1525G>A polymorphism genotypes and the FasL-844 T>C polymorphism genotypes between the HCV patients and the controls (p=0.001 and 0.02 respectively), with association of the -1525GA genotype and -844 TT genotype with increased risk of HCV infection (OR=2.68, 1.942 respectively, 95% CI=1.482-4.846, 1.1-3.43, respectively). No significant association was detected between TRAIL, FasL and the viral load. Our results suggest that the FasL -844T>C SNP is implicated in the susceptibility to HCV in Egyptian patients and firstly report the involvement of TRAIL gene polymorphism in the risk of the disease. Therefore we recommend national programs to delineate genetic factors that may put individuals at risk for contracting HCV."

5007,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can slow down the replication of HIV-1, leading to an improvement in the survival of HIV-1-infected patients. However, drug toxicities and poor drug administration has led to the emergence of a drug-resistant strain. HIV-1 immunotherapy has been continuously developed, but antibody therapy and HIV vaccines take time to improve its efficiency and have limitations. HIV-1-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based immunotherapy founded on neutralizing antibodies is now being developed. In HIV-1 therapy, anti-HIV chimeric antigen receptors showed promising data in the suppression of HIV-1 replication; however, autologous transfusion is still a problem. This has led to the development of effective peptides and proteins for an alternative HIV-1 treatment. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of potent anti-HIV-1 peptides and proteins that reveal promising therapeutic activities. The inhibitory mechanisms of each therapeutic molecule in the different stages of the HIV-1 life cycle will be discussed herein."

Although these aneurysms have important clinical implications, their etiology and optimal therapy are unknown. We present a systematic review of diffuse intracranial fusiform aneurysmal vasculopathy in patients who are HIV-positive. We conducted a comprehensive literature search for relevant case reports and reviews published before February 2009. Patients were included if they had HIV infection and radiographic imaging consistent with fusiform aneurysmal vasculopathy. We identify 11 published adult cases of intracranial fusiform aneurysmal vasculopathy and describe 1 unpublished case from our own institution. Available data regarding clinical presentation, characteristic imaging findings, and treatment of this complex syndrome are reviewed. Adults with HIV-associated intracranial aneurysmal vasculopathy typically are significantly immunosuppressed and present with gross neurologic dysfunction. Characteristic radiographic findings include diffuse cerebral fusiform aneurysms with hemorrhage or infarct. Treatment of any active infection followed by the initiation of antiretroviral therapy and corticosteroids may be a reasonable approach in this complex syndrome."
6525,0.004,4.0,"During the routine care of patients, pulmonary and critical care specialist may have significant exposure to respiratory infections and potentially infectious body fluids such as blood and pleural fluid. Bronchoscopy and intensive care services often require close contact with patients and the use of sharp devices required for intravascular catheterization. Rendering such care places physicians at risk for acquiring agents such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis viruses, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As of December 1998, 188 cases of occupational transmission of HIV to health care workers (HCWs) in the United States have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control. Most documented cases of seroconversion involve percutaneous injury involving blood, with the greatest risks being associated with injury from a hollow-bore needle that has been in an infected patient's vein or artery. Because thousands of HIV-infected persons are unaware of their infection, HCWs must consider all patients to be infected with HIV and improve work practices accordingly. Nevertheless, elimination of all exposures is impossible, and postexposure prophylaxis with combination antiretroviral therapy is recommended for persons deemed a high risk of contracting HIV. Pulmonary specialists are at high risk of exposure to tuberculosis; proper precautions include isolation of patients with suspected tuberculosis and the use of DMF-HEPA respirator masks, especially while performing procedures like bronchoscopy. Contaminated bronchoscopes have been implicated in transmission and ""pseudoinfection"" of tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria, underscoring the need for rigorous cleaning and disinfection practices."

Swedish samples were used as reference material. The Ethiopian HIV-1+ subjects were found to have significantly increased TNF-alpha and neopterin, but not IFN-alpha levels. Increased levels of TNF-alpha and neopterin were frequently found in Ethiopian asymptomatic subjects (37% and 47%), and the concentration increased in patients with AIDS (83% and 90% respectively). The levels of the two substances and the proportion of patients with higher TNF-alpha values were lower in the corresponding Swedish subjects. The proportion of sera with raised levels of IFN-alpha was very low (asymptomatic 4%, and AIDS 7%) in Ethiopian subjects. These results suggest a very early increase in the TNF-alpha production and activation of the cellular immune response, and a low level of IFN-alpha synthesis in the natural course of HIV infection in Ethiopia. The aberrations may contribute to a rapid progress of immunodeficiency and cachexia often seen in Ethiopian patients."

The Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV/AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN) (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00146419) is a prospective observational cohort study of HIV-infected adults. At baseline, comprehensive data were collected, including cystatin C and measures of renal function. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with baseline renal dysfunction [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) calculated using the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation] and elevated cystatin C (>1.0 mg/liter) in a cross-sectional analysis. Among 670 subjects with complete data (mean age 41 years, mean CD4 cell count 530 cells/mm(3), 79% prescribed cART), the mean eGFR was 96.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Forty percent of subjects had renal dysfunction; 3.3% had chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Elevated cystatin C was present in 18% of subjects. In multivariate analysis, renal dysfunction was associated with older age, non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, higher body mass index (BMI), hypertension, higher cystatin C levels, and current prescription of ritonavir. Factors associated with elevated cystatin C included hepatitis C coinfection, hypertension, current smoking, older age, current tenofovir use, detectable plasma HIV RNA, and elevated microalbuminuria. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was low in this contemporary HIV cohort. However, mild to moderate renal dysfunction was common despite the widespread use of cART."

The influence of AIDS-related education and the experience of caring for affected patients on health visitors' knowledge of the disease was assessed. The attitudes of carers towards these patients were also ascertained. All heath visitors (n = 88) working in the Merton and Sutton Community Healthcare Trust were invited to participate in a questionnaire survey. Fifty-five health visitors participated. Knowledge relating to HIV and AIDS was good, but the majority of respondents felt they did not have all the information they needed about HIV and AIDS. Almost one-quarter of respondents had cared for a client who was either HIV positive or had AIDS. Overall, the findings were quite encouraging. However, further education, training, and support were identified as necessary. These shortfalls need to be addressed in order to fully assist health visitors in their role of caring for clients and families affected by HIV and AIDS."

Findings indicated that, after accounting for negative affectivity and ART side-effect severity, distress tolerance was significantly associated with pill count adherence as well as viral load. Specifically, a differential association was observed whereby self-reported distress tolerance was associated with pill count adherence, whereas behavioral distress tolerance was associated with viral load. Importantly, no associations were observed between either measure of distress tolerance and CD4 count. Findings are discussed in terms of the importance of both behavioral and perceived distress tolerance assessment among patients with HIV as well as potential clinical implications related to the integration of distress tolerance-focused treatments into existing interventions for individuals with HIV."

After a year of acrimonious debate over the proper approach to the issues discussed in Behringer, no consensus has emerged. The Centers for Disease Control has quietly abandoned its plan to ease its July 1991 guidelines that call for infected professionals to cease performing invasive procedures or disclose their conditions to their patients. It has now decided to let each state set its own rules and regulations in compliance with its guidelines, or risk financial penalties. The issues discussed in Behringer have remained controversial.

5827,0.004,4.0,"A patient with HIV infection who experienced immune reconstitution after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [increase in CD4 T cell count from <1/microl to >600/microl] presented with severe Graves' disease 32 months after commencing HAART. A comprehensive clinical and laboratory study demonstrated pronounced regional lymphadenopathy and thymic enlargement at presentation, and that the onset of thyrotropin receptor antibody production was associated with increased production of soluble CD30 (a marker of type 2 immune responses). Blood naive CD8 T cell counts and TREC levels in both CD4 and CD8 T cells were increased at multiple time points compared with carefully selected controls. We conclude that the Graves' disease in this patient was associated with abnormally high blood counts of thymus-derived T cells, and propose that Graves' disease after HAART in this and other HIV patients may result from failure to delete autoreactive T cell clones in the regenerating thymus."
6322,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection is characterized by chronic immune activation and progressive loss of CD4+ T cells, leading to a wide array of immune dysfunction, particularly involving immune response directed against viral antigens. HIV-1 encodes for fifteen proteins, which might serve as a target for immune recognition. Immune response to the envelope proteins have been studied more due to their presence on the surface of the virus. Recent studies on HIV vaccine development have focused on the Gag and Pol proteins. The transactivator Tat and Rev proteins have also been the focus of immunization studies due to their potent regulatory activity. The Tat (transactivator of transcription) protein although being nuclear in localization is also released from infected cells and acts on uninfected cells. Extracellular Tat seems to play an important role in AIDS pathogenesis. Furthermore, a correlation has been found between anti-Tat immune response and slow progression of the disease. Although several studies have shown Tat as a potential vaccine candidate with encouraging results, there are also reports raising doubt about its efficacy in multi-component HIV vaccine strategy. Here, we have addressed the issue of immune response to the most indispensable HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat."
7311,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus infection is highly endemic in China, especially in rural areas such as Dianjiang County with poor-quality health care and little local HBV information. Therefore, for the first time, the present study was carried out to investigate the molecular epidemiology, phylogeny and population dynamics of HBV based on 146 HBV-infected patients. A 435-bp portion of the HBV S region was sequenced, and the phylogeny was reconstructed, indicating that three genotypes, B, C and D of HBV were distributed in Dianjiang County. The predominant genotype is B (67.12 %), followed by C (32.19 %) and D (0.68 %). Patient demographic information and clinical outcomes were examined by genotypes, and no significant association was found. Population dynamics analysis suggested that both genotype B and C have experienced a tenfold expansion during the last five years for reasons that are unclear. Thus, a thorough molecular epidemiology investigation is strongly recommended in the future. "
4193,0.004,4.0,"The most common first-line, highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) received by individuals infected with HIV-1 in Cameroon is the combination therapy Triomune, comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI). To examine the efficacy of these drugs in Cameroon, where diverse non-B HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses predominate, the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral sequences in patient plasma were analyzed for the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance. Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon."
2417,0.004,4.0,"We conducted a community-based study of the prevalence and correlates of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and immunization among young adults in a ""drug supermarket"" neighborhood in New York City. Four hundred eighty-nine young adults ages 18-24 years were recruited from Bushwick, Brooklyn through multistage household probability sampling (n = 332) and targeted sampling (n = 157), interviewed, and tested for three hepatitis B markers (HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs). Serological evidence of HBV infection was found in 8.0% (6.0% in the household sample and 12.1% in the targeted sample) and of hepatitis B immunization in 19.6% (22.6% in the household sample and 13.4% in the targeted sample). HBV infection was higher among young adults who either used crack or injected drugs and among those who traded sex for money or drugs. Having Medicaid was significantly associated with lower odds of infection in the household sample and higher odds of immunization in the targeted sample. Although adolescent hepatitis B immunization has been a public health priority in the United States since 1995, nearly three-quarters of young adults in this community did not have serological evidence of being either exposed or immunized. Whereas subsequent younger generations benefited from universal childhood hepatitis B immunization, this particular cohort of young adults who live in communities like Bushwick presents a unique group for prevention intervention."

In 2013, the WHO revised its recommendations for initiating ART among people living with HIV (PLHIV) by increasing the threshold for ART initiation to a CD4 count ≤500 cells/uL. For certain patient groups, ART is recommended irrespective of CD4 count (PLHIV with active tuberculosis, hepatitis B virus infection, pregnant and breast feeding women, children aged under five years and those living in a sero-discordant relationship). In this operational research, we assess the effect of applying this recommendation on the number of PLHIV additionally eligible for ART."
8997,0.004,4.0,"Mutation rates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomes have been estimated using purified reverse transcriptase or single-round infection system. Since small sequences were used as templates, the overall mutation rates could only be extrapolated and the biological significance of mutations is unknown. For direct estimation of HIV-1 mutation rates and understanding of the potential biological influences of mutations, we obtained 19 complete or nearly full-length proviral genomes from single-round-infected adherent cells of lymphocytes by using a lambda phage library method and a long-range PCR technique. Analysis of 160,000 bp of sequences showed that the overall mutation rate of HIV-1 genomes was 5.4 x 10(-5) per base per replication cycle. On average, 1.1 mutations (range, 0 to 3) were generated in each viral genome during one infection cycle. Inspection of the mutations in the HIV-1 genome revealed that all site mutations within protein-coding regions were nonsynonymous mutations. Among all mutations, half were deleterious (premature stop codon and deletions) and would result in defective genomes. By applying the same system to an HIV-1 genome with a G262A mutation in the thumb region of the reverse transcriptase, a significant increase was observed in deletion and insertion mutation rates but no increase in the overall mutation rate in viral genomes was found."
8553,0.004,4.0,"Cohort studies of young (aged 18-30 years) injecting drug users recruited in 1997-1999 in the Harlem and Lower East Side areas of New York City, New York, were used to assess the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The authors found that HIV incidence was low at both sites: 0.8/100 person-years at the Harlem site and 0/100 person-years at the Lower East Side site. In contrast, HBV incidence was moderate (12.2/100 person-years) at the Harlem site and high (30.7/100 person-years) at the Lower East Side site. Similarly, HCV incidence was moderate (9.3/100 person-years) at the Harlem site and high (34.0/100 person-years) at the Lower East Side site. Results show that high rates of HBV and HCV transmission do not imply high rates of HIV transmission, even within an area of high HIV seroprevalence."
1305,0.004,4.0,"To explore the biologic significance of the presence of a heterogeneous human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population within infected individuals with regard to ultimate disease progression, the effect of coinfection of more than one variant of HIV on infectivity and cytopathogenicity in CD4-positive cells was examined. Using the lowest and highest infectious clones of HIV obtained by the plaque-cloning method, a clear consistent synergism of infectivity and cytopathic effects was detected when different cell lines were coinfected with a mixture of the two clones. These data suggest that the emergence of a highly infectious variant of HIV due to mutation may modify the infectivity of a minimally infectious latent variant with the final progression of HIV infection to overt AIDS."
9021,0.004,4.0,"The production of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) has been reported as being significantly associated with the gene polymorphism in the leader sequence at positions +29. The current study aimed to evaluate the associations between the polymorphism and the clinical characteristics of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). A total of 422 (252 men; mean age: 49.7 +/- 11.2 years) Taiwanese CHC patients with liver biopsies were enrolled. The TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism at position +29 (T or C), hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genotypes, and serum HCV RNA levels of these patients were determined. Of the 422 patients, the frequency of the T allele was 45.4%. Based on univariate analyses, a significantly lesser proportion of patients with allele T had high viral loads than those who were without allele T (P = 0.026). The lesser HCV RNA levels and HCV genotype 1b infection were significantly associated with the inheritance of the T allele in female patients based on univariate (P = 0.012 and 0.007, respectively) and multivariate regression (odds ratio/95% confidence interval: 0.434/0.219-0.859 and 0.468/0.237-0.927, respectively) analyses. In male patients with or without inheritance of the T allele, the clinical characteristics were similar. In conclusion, the association between TGF-beta1 polymorphism and virologic characteristics of chronic HCV infection implicated a significant role of host genetic factors on the clinical features of CHC. Female patients who carry T allele at position +29 were predisposed to be associated with HCV genotype non-1b infection and lesser HCV viral load, which revealed the gender effect."
8320,0.004,4.0,"This study shows first data on HTLV-1/2 seroprevalence among pregnant women in the non-endemic region of Argentina. In a retrospective study a representative sample (n = 3,143) of the pregnant women registered in the health public service in the province of Córdoba was evaluated. HTLV-1/2 seroprevalence was 0.191% +/- 0.0857 [IC 0.022-0.359]. This prevalence was 10 times higher in pregnant women than in blood donors [0.019 (4/21.183)]. The pregnant women would reflect the epidemiology of the general population more accurately since it constitutes a more heterogeneous group than that of blood donors. The prevalence of infection with HIV was 2.8 times higher than that of HTLV-1/2 (P < 0.05) and the presence of any of these two viruses was not a subrogating indicator of the presence of the other (Goodman and Kruskal's Tau coefficient = 0.0092). The prevalence of HBV was not significantly different from that of HTLV-1/2 (P > 0.05). We consider that it is necessary to carry out continuous studies in order to define the main risk factors for infection of these women. Thus, a decision could be made to apply the best policy in public health to prevent vertical transmission of the virus in Argentina."
3633,0.004,4.0,"The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C coinfections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected adults at an HIV center in Gaborone, Botswana. A retrospective review was performed of charts of currently active HIV-infected adult patients in the Family Model Clinic (FMC) of the Botswana-Baylor Children's Clinical Center of Excellence (BCOE) in Gaborone, Botswana, for the results of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antihepatitis C IgG tests performed between January 1, 2005 and December 15, 2009. Of 308 active FMC patients, 266 underwent HBsAg serology testing within the period of study. The HBsAg coinfection prevalence was 5.3% (14/266); 2 of 252 patients had at least one positive antihepatitis C IgG serology, a 0.8% prevalence. Hepatitis B coinfection is relatively common in HIV-infected adults at our center in Botswana, whereas hepatitis C coinfection is rare. In this setting, where the diagnosis of hepatitis B coinfection with HIV has implications for choice of first-line antiretroviral therapy and prevention of perinatal hepatitis B transmission, broader sampling to establish the true population prevalence of hepatitis B coinfection and the desirability of adding screening to HIV management should be considered. These findings provide little justification for adding hepatitis C coinfection screening to the management of HIV infection in Botswana."
1123,0.004,4.0,"In the last two decades, HIV-1, the retrovirus associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is globally one of the primary causes of morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, existing approaches for interventions are not able to suppress the progression of infection due to this virus. Of the many obstacles, viral entry into the mono-nuclear phagocyte system encompassing monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is a major concern. Viral infection is also responsible for the subsequent distribution of the virus into various tissues throughout the organism. Tremendous progress has been made during the past few years to diagnose and treat patients with HIV/AIDS infection, yet much remains to be done. Recommended treatment involves long-term and multiple drug therapy that causes severe side effects. With almost 12% of the world population suffering from HIV/AIDS, better management of this global threat is highly desired. Nanostructured delivery systems hold promise for improving the situation. Such systems can facilitate the uptake of antiretroviral drugs, causing a considerable improvement in HIV/AIDS therapy. Nanoscale systems have intriguing potential to drastically improve existing HIV/AIDS diagnosis and treatment platforms. Nanosystems constitute a wide range of systems varying from polymeric nanoparticles, to solid-lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, micro- and nanoemulsions, dendrimers, and self-nanoemulsifying systems. Improved bioavailability, solubility, stability, and biocompatibility make them an ideal choice for delivery of antiretroviral drugs. The present review initially describes an updated bird's-eye view account of the literature. Then, we provide a relatively sententious overview on updated patents of recent nanostructured delivery systems for antiretroviral drugs. Finally, we discuss low-cost therapy (such as antioxidants and immune modulators) for the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS. "
1140,0.004,4.0,"To better understand patient beliefs, which may influence adherence to HIV care and treatment, we examined three dimensions of beliefs among Ethiopian adults (n = 1177) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). Beliefs about benefits of ART/HIV clinical care were largely accurate, but few patients believed in the ability of ART to prevent sexual transmission and many thought Holy Water could cure HIV. Factors associated with lower odds of accurate beliefs included advanced HIV, lack of formal education, and Muslim religion (benefits of ART/clinical care); secondary or university education and more clinic visits (ART to prevent sexual transmission); and pregnancy and Orthodox Christian religion (Holy Water). Assessment of patient beliefs may help providers identify areas needing reinforcement. In this setting, counselors also need to stress the benefits of ART as prevention and that Holy Water should not be used to the exclusion of HIV care and ART."

6867,0.003,3.0,"In this study, we aimed to explore whether interleukin-18 (IL-18) gene-promoter polymorphisms are associated with the outcome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In all, 204 chronically HBV-infected patients were recruited in this study. Of the 204 HBV-infected patients, 43 were considered to be inactive HBV carriers based on the sustained normalization of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) together with seropositivity for the antibody to hepatitis B e-antigen (anti-HBe). A total of 161 patients were found to have chronic progressive liver disease, which included cirrhosis. In these HBV-infected patients, the frequencies of AA genotype of IL-18 gene-promoter polymorphisms at position -607 and C allele at position -137 were significantly higher in inactive HBV carriers compared with those in patients with chronic progressive liver disease. These polymorphisms of the IL-18 promoter regions (-607 and -137) could be associated with different outcomes of HBV infection."
5417,0.003,3.0,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Yupik Eskimos in southwestern Alaska, detected in early stages as a result of screening, appears to be more frequently associated with variants of chronic portal inflammation in the noninvolved liver than with fully developed cirrhosis, otherwise common in HBV-associated HCC from other geographic areas. Of 38 patients diagnosed with HCC since 1969, adequate tissue was available from both the tumor and nontumorous liver in 17. Of the 17 specimens, 14 had chronic portal inflammation and three had advanced cirrhosis; 12 of the 14 were from hepatitis B surface antigen carriers. These 12 cases were studied in detail to examine the features accompanying the development of HCC unobscured by cirrhotic transformation. In the noninvolved parenchyma they included hepatocytic nodules as apparent precursors to HCC and, as markers of phenotypic alterations, dysplastic hepatocytes and hepatitis B surface antigen-laden ground-glass hepatocytes. The latter were observed in eight instances and often accumulated in nodules. Parenchyma within 1 mm of the HCC exhibited increased confluent hyperplasia and frequently conspicuous necroinflammation associated with pericellular and periductular fibrosis, which contributed, in addition to fibrous connections between displaced and heavily inflamed portal tracts, to the capsule that was forming in all cases to varying degrees in the pericarcinomatous region. The HCC was uniformly trabecular and in a few specimens, a continuous transition from hyperplasia and dysplasia near the periphery of the tumor to increasing anaplasia in the center could be made out in addition to pressure effects of the HCC. The pericarcinomatous changes, including hyperplasia progressing to neoplasia and necroinflammation, are also observed in experimental models, particularly the woodchuck HCC induced by a hepadna virus related to HBV. Coordinated morphologic and molecular biologic studies on such animal models and on human HCC detected by screening, as for instance in Eskimos, neither complicated by cirrhosis, should elucidate the direction of the evolution of the HCC and the postulated promoting role of the inflammation."

Information is lacking regarding the prevalence of cigarette smoking among people living with HIV or about their intentions to quit smoking. A survey was conducted with a sample of patients attending an HIV outpatient clinic at San Francisco General Hospital to assess the prevalence of cigarette smoking and the level of interest in quitting. In total, 228 assessments were completed. Study results revealed a high percentage of smokers among our sample of individuals living with HIV compared to the percentage of smokers found in the general adult population. A total of 123 individuals (54%) reported that they smoked cigarettes. Men were more than twice as likely to have made previous attempts at smoking cessation than were woman. The majority of cigarette smokers (63%) reported that they were currently thinking about quitting. Respondents' preferences for types of smoking cessation methods are discussed, and recommendations are proposed for identifying and treating tobacco dependence in this population."
1286,0.003,3.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) introduced in association with the luciferase reporter gene into Jurkat T cells was strongly activated by a combination of human neutrophils and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Activation was not observed when normal neutrophils were replaced by neutrophils which lack a respiratory burst, ie, from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), was strongly inhibited by catalase, was potentiated by vanadate, was stimulated by relatively low concentrations of azide, and was inhibited by selective inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC). The PMA affected activation in three ways: (1) by directly activating the LTR in Jurkat LTRluc; (2) by inducing a respiratory burst in neutrophils with the formation of H2O2; and (3) by increasing the sensitivity of Jurkat LTRluc to the activating effect of H2O2. When PMA was replaced by opsonized zymosan as the neutrophil stimulus, activation of the LTR was low unless azide was added. Activation in the presence of azide was not seen when CGD neutrophils were used or when catalase was added, suggesting that azide acts by inhibiting the degradation of H2O2. These findings indicate that activation of the HIV-1 LTR in Jurkat T cells can be induced by H2O2 released by neutrophils, particularly when PKC is concomitantly activated."
8726,0.003,3.0,"We report the first study on prevalence of antiretroviral drug-associated resistance mutations in Venezuela. Protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding regions were analyzed in DNA samples obtained from 100 HIV-1-infected individuals. Primary resistance mutations to RT inhibitors were identified in 26% of patients treated with these drugs. Transmission of HIV-1-resistant strains was detected in a drug-naive patient (3%). Primary resistance mutations to protease inhibitors (PIs) were present in 9% of the 44 PI-treated patients and in 1 PI-naive individual. Phylogenetic analysis of these samples has resulted in the most extensive survey, to date, of HIV-1 genetic forms circulating in Venezuela. Ninety-nine samples clustered with subtype B, and 1 individual harbored the first B/F recombinant virus reported in Venezuela, with protease clustering with subtype F and RT with subtype B.

2792,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence and the clinical course of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections were studied in 23 HIV-1-infected children, who were born to 22 mothers with HIV-1/HCV coinfection. During the follow-up only two children (8.7%) showed persistent anti-HCV antibodies and circulating HCV RNA. Both children, who were aged 10 and 10.6 years respectively at the end of follow-up, had chronically-evolving liver disease and autoimmune thrombocytopenia but no signs of progressive HIV disease. Based on our experience, vertically-acquired HIV-1/HCV coinfection is less frequent than is generally reported and may be associated with the development of chronic thrombocytopenia in addition to liver disease. Moreover, perinatal HIV-1/HCV coinfection appears to be associated with a slow progression of HIV disease."
8834,0.003,3.0,"Our aim was to study the characteristics of hepatitis G virus (HGV) infection in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We evaluated 108 patients from two different units (A: 67 patients; B: 41 patients). HGV RNA and HCV RNA were detected by PCR. Nineteen patients (17.6%) were HGV RNA positive (20.9% in unit A and 12.2% in unit B (NS)). HCV RNA was positive in 19 patients (17.6%) (28.4% in unit A and 0 in unit B (p < 0.01)). Eight patients were HGV RNA and HCV RNA positive (group I), 11 HGV RNA positive (group II), 11 HCV RNA positive (group III), and 78 negative for both viruses (group IV). Time on HD was 51.3 +/- 37.0 months for group I, 36.0 +/- 27.9 months for group II, 63.5 +/- 40.2 months for group III, and 26.4 +/- 27.1 months for group IV (p < 0.01 for I and III). Seven patients (87.5%) from group I, 9 (81.8%) from group II, 10 (90.9%) from group III, and 44 (56.4%) from group IV had a history of transfusion (p < 0.03 for I, II and III). Two patients (25%) from group I, none from group II, 5 (45.4%) from group III, and 6 (7.7%) from group IV had chronic ALAT elevation (p < 0.01 for I and III). We conclude that HGV infection was frequent in our HD patients, related to transfusions and independent of HCV prevalence, and that HGV infection itself was not a cause of ALAT elevation suggesting chronic hepatitis."
2568,0.003,3.0,"Background Portugal has the highest prevalence rate of HIV infection in Western Europe. The proportion of patients with a late diagnosis, carried out in full-blown AIDS stage, remains high. Skin and mucous membrane manifestations are not rare in these patients. Objective A demographic, clinical, and laboratorial characterization of patients with de novo HIV infection diagnosis made in the Department of Dermatology and Venereology of a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of adult patients newly diagnosed with HIV infection (reactive immunoassay for antibodies to HIV-1/HIV-2 or HIV p24 antigen) in the Dermatology and Venereology Department of a Portuguese central hospital in the period between January 2005 and December 2013. Results During the study period, 97 new cases were diagnosed, 70 men and 27 women. The median age at diagnosis was 36 years. Of the total, 50 cases were diagnosed with a concomitant sexually transmitted infection (STI), more frequently syphilis and ano-genital HPV infection. The remaining 47 patients were diagnosed with other dermatological conditions such as prurigo nodularis, psoriasis, and Kaposi's sarcoma. The duration of complaints that lead to medical attention ranged from <1 week to 8 years, being significantly lower in patients diagnosed with a concomitant STI ( p < 0.01). Basal viral load was also lower in this group of patients ( p < 0.05). Of all the new diagnosed cases, 80% of patients are currently retained in care. Conclusion This study grants a descriptive overview of de novo HIV infection diagnoses performed by dermatovenereologists in a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. As in the past, the importance of Dermato-Venereology for HIV infection diagnosis remains present in daily clinical practice."
9176,0.003,3.0,"The authors aimed to describe cell phone and Internet use and assess the correlation of Internet use for health care engagement purposes and HIV clinical outcomes among HIV-positive individuals. The authors conducted a national survey using online social media to examine cell phone and Internet use, self-reported HIV viral load (detectable vs. undetectable), and antiretroviral adherence rating (excellent vs. less than excellent). Participants (N = 1,494) were asked about their Internet use for health care engagement purposes (including e-mailing health care providers, refilling medications online, and making medical appointments online). Approximately 95% of participants accessed the Internet nearly daily or daily in the past month (mean hours on Internet use per day = 5.2) and 55.5% used the Internet for health care engagement purposes. Those who used the Internet for any health care engagement purposes had a 1.52-fold odds of reporting an undetectable viral load (p = .009) and a 1.49-fold odds of reporting excellent adherence (p = .001). Although Internet access and use were similar across racial/ethnic, educational, and socioeconomic groups, disparities existed with the use of the Internet for health care engagement purposes among racial/ethnic minorities, those with low to moderate financial stability, lower education, and history of incarceration. The authors' data reveal that among HIV-positive users of online social media, use of the Internet for health care engagement purposes is associated with better self-reported virologic and adherence outcomes."

The anti-HCV was performed by third generation immunoenzymatic technique, and the HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction. The overall prevalence of hepatitis C virus was 16% (CI: 12.4 - 19.6). Multivariate analysis showed association between virus C infection and age, with significant risk in the group about fifty years old or more (OR=9.75), blood transfusion (OR=4.74) and use of injecting drugs (OR=149.28). The hepatitis C virus infection was detected in 83.7% of intravenous drug users and 22.1% of transfused patients.

Cell culture for CMV detected 9.3% of the PCR-positive samples, whilst histology identified CMV inclusions in 15.9% of samples, all of which were CMV PCR-positive. CMV was most frequently detected in adrenal and lung tissues by histology. These results show that co-infection with CMV and HIV is a common occurrence in organs from AIDS patients and provide further evidence for a role of cytomegalovirus in the pathogenesis of AIDS."
3774,0.003,3.0,"Many hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected individuals do not have any obvious risk factors and one of the putative sources of infection may be inadvertent exposure to infected blood or body fluids in the clinical setting. The aim of this study was to assess the role of medical procedures in transmission of hepatitis C in north-eastern Poland. In total, 194 patients with chronic hepatitis C were eligible for the study. The control group consisted of 275 age- and sex-matched individuals. Patients with a history of intravenous drug use were excluded. On multivariate analysis, transfusions [odds ratio (OR) = 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-6.3], minor surgery (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.5-6.7) and dental care (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.4-4.0) were independently associated with HCV infection. We conclude that apart from transfusion, minor medical procedures and dental care may carry a significant risk of hepatitis C infection. Improvements in basic hygiene routines and strict adherence to universal precautions may be essential to prevent iatrogenic transmission of the infection."

5501,0.003,3.0,"Thirty-four patients from the Philadelphia area with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were matched with colon cancer patients, lung cancer patients and blood donors according to age and sex. Sera from the four groups were tested to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Five of the HCC patients (14.7%) and none of the controls were positive for HBsAg. At least one of the three serologic markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was found in 51.5% of the HCC patients, 5.3% of the colon cancer patients, 11.1% of the lung cancer patients, and 10.7% of the blood donors. Twelve of the seventeen seropositive HCC patients (70.6%) were positive for anti-HBc alone, while all of the seropositive lung cancer patients and donors were positive for anti-HBs alone. Sera positive for any HBV marker were also tested for e antigen (HBeAg) and its antibody (anti-HBe). Four of the HCC patients (23.5% of the seropositives) had anti-HBe, while none of the sera tested had HBeAg. A history of alcoholism did not appear to influence HBV seropositivity in the HCC patients. This study supports the hypothesis that HBV infection is closely associated with HCC even in areas where both conditions are uncommon. The wide disparity between seropositivity for HBsAg and anti-HBc in the HCC patients is an unusual feature, for which an age effect may be the best explanation."
7585,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was determined in the relatives, friends, and sex partners of AIDS patients in Haiti and in other unrelated Haitian population groups. Among contacts of AIDS patients, HIV seroprevalence was highest among sex partners of the opposite sex (55%) and lowest among female relatives and friends (9%) of female AIDS patients. Male relatives and friends of male AIDS patients had a seroprevalence rate of 19% and also had a history of multiple heterosexual partners and frequent contact with prostitutes. The HIV seroprevalence rate among unrelated groups of Haitian adults ranged from 2% in rural healthy adults to 22% among tuberculosis patients to a high of 49% among Haitian prostitutes. This seroprevalence pattern suggests that HIV infection is widespread in Haiti and that heterosexual activity plays a major role in transmission."
5986,0.003,3.0,"To address the unique manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among adolescents aged 13 through 21 years, a comprehensive evaluation and treatment program for high-risk and HIV-positive adolescents was developed in New York City in 1987. Among HIV-infected youth, mean age of testing was 18.2 years. One third of the HIV-positive patients were female and four fifths were African-American or Hispanic. No significant differences were found between HIV-positive (n = 50) and HIV-negative (n = 43) patients for age at first intercourse, injecting or other illicit drug use, history of sexually transmitted diseases, or survival sex (exchange of sex for money or drugs). HIV-positive males were more likely than HIV-negative males to have engaged in anal intercourse and to report a history of sexual abuse. Among infected females, 82% acquired HIV through heterosexual intercourse. Almost half (48%) of HIV-positive adolescents had significant immune dysfunction at the time of their initial visit (CD4 < 500/mm3) and were eligible for zidovudine. Many HIV-positive adolescents continued high-risk behaviors such as intercourse without condoms, particularly those with ongoing dependence on drugs or alcohol. With the epidemic of HIV infection increasing nationwide among adolescents, specialized, comprehensive programs are needed to counsel and treat HIV-infected adolescents and youth in high-risk situations."
10004,0.003,3.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has become the gold standard treatment of HIV/AIDS infection. NRTI-related mitochondrial toxicity has been recognized as a serious adverse effect of HAART. The mechanisms underlying NRTI-induced mitochondriopathy involve the inhibition of the human DNA polymerase gamma mtDNA mutations and oxidative stress. The clinical spectrum of NRTI-related toxicity ranges from a subclinical disease e.g. mild hepatic abnormalities, to a rare life-threatening condition with lactic acidosis and hepatic insufficiency. In the latter, liver histology shows massive steatosis. Ultrastructural assessment of mitochondrial abnormalities may be of help to address the NRTI toxicity in poorly symptomatic patients. Efforts have been recently made to assess the clinical relevance of non-invasive tests including the evaluation of mtDNA or mitochondrial functions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells for the diagnosis of NRTI-associated toxicity."
6231,0.003,3.0,An increase of the mean corpuscular volume of the red blood cells has been repeatedly described in antiretroviral treated patients. Most commonly macrocytosis was associated with the use of certain nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The aim of this study was to analyse if macrocytosis might be a marker of mitochondrial toxicity in antiretrovirally treated HIV-infected patients. Using the (13)C-methionine breath test we analysed the hepatic mitochondrial function in vivo in antiretrovirally treated HIV-infected patients with macrocytosis. MCV was significantly negatively correlated to the breath test results. For the first time we could show a significant association between an increase of the mean corpuscular erythrocyte volume by treatment with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and the hepatic mitochondrial function in vivo.
5112,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly endemic in the Solomon Islands. However, little is known about the status of occult HBV infection in the Solomon Islands. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of occult HBV infection and its clinical and virological features in the community of Solomon Islands. Blood samples were collected from a total of 564 asymptomatic individuals aged over 18 years in the Western province. The samples used in the present study consisted of 200 samples from 108 males and 92 females (mean age, 37.4 years; range, 18-71 years) that were randomly selected among the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative samples from all the participants enrolled in this study. HBV-DNA was detected by real-time PCR in 25 (12.5%) of the 200 HBsAg-negative samples. Most of the HBV-DNA-positive individuals were infected with wild-type HBV, and only 3 strains demonstrated specific amino acid substitutions (P121X, T123N, C138S, P142S and D144E) in the α determinant region. In conclusion, occult HBV infection was documented in 12.5% of individuals that demonstrated serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection in this study. The prevalence of occult infection was also influenced by ethnicity; it was more prevalent in Melanesians than Micronesians. In addition, occult HBV infection demonstrated a weak association with the S-variants."
7127,0.003,3.0,The advent of new chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapies requires characterization of patients in order to predict adequate treatment. A good candidate marker is Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD-1) which is involved in progression of HCV infection.

4403,0.003,3.0,"The successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a combination of potent antiretroviral agents, including protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, has impacted positively on morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. Over time, HAART has been associated with a number of metabolic and anthropometric abnormalities, including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance as well as subcutaneous fat loss and abdominal obesity, potentially contributing to cardiovascular risk. Recent studies have more firmly established that both HIV infection and HAART might increase the risk of clinical cardiovascular events. Furthermore, whereas HIV/HAART is associated with multiple aspects of endocrine dysfunction, there has been less focus on bone disease, although some studies indicate a higher prevalence of osteoporosis among HIV-positive subjects compared to HIV-negative controls. The relationship between bone and fat metabolism under HIV-positive conditions deserves further attention, and available data suggest the possibility of an intriguing connection. In the future, an increasing population of aging HIV-positive patients with a spectrum of antiretroviral therapies and accumulation of endocrine abnormalities and conventional cardiovascular risk factors will present preventive and therapeutic challenges to our health-care system."
2402,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) progressively depletes GSH content in humans. Although the accumulated evidence suggests a role of decreased GSH in the pathogenesis of HIV, significant controversy remains concerning the mechanism of GSH depletion, especially in regard to envisioning appropriate therapeutic strategies to help compensate for such decreased antioxidant capacity. Tat, a transactivator encoded by HIV, is sufficient to cause GSH depletion in vitro and is implicated in AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma and B cell lymphoma. In this study, we report a decrease in GSH biosynthesis with Tat, using HIV-1 Tat transgenic (Tat+) mice. A significant decline in the total intracellular GSH content in liver and erythrocytes of Tat+ mice was accompanied by decreased gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase regulatory subunit mRNA and protein content, which resulted in an increased sensitivity of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase to feedback inhibition by GSH. Further study revealed a significant reduction in the activity of GSH synthetase in liver of Tat+ mice, which was linearly associated with their GSH content. Therefore, Tat appears to decrease GSH in vivo, at least partially, through modulation of GSH biosynthetic enzymes."
3710,0.003,3.0,"In order to evaluate the interference of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in hepatitis B viral particle (HBsAg, HBcAg) expression in the liver of chronic HDV patients, 39 and 81 liver biopsies of HBsAg carriers seropositive for anti-HDV and anti-HDV negative controls, respectively, were studied. HBcAg was positive in 16.7% of the HBeAg-positive patients with HDAg in the liver and in 91,4% of controls. In contrast, in HBeAg- and anti-HDV negative patients the intrahepatic expression of HBcAg was detected in 32.6%. In anti-HDV negative patients the HBcAg liver expression correlated significantly with the HBeAg in serum (p < 0.00001). The distribution of HBcAg was exclusively cytoplasmatic in 30% of HDV-infected patients but mixed nuclear and cytoplasmic in 38.3% of the controls. The nuclear expression of HBcAg was decreased in chronic HDV infection. HBsAg was positive in 70.3% of patients who were anti-HDV positive and in 82.3% of controls. The membranous expression of HBsAg was detected less frequently in HDV-infected patients (p < 0.05) than in controls, while associated with HBeAg in serum of HBV carriers without HDV superinfection (p < 0.00001). The prevalence and the HBsAg cytoplasmic expression was not different for the chronic HDV infection or controls. Our results show: 1) decreased intrahepatic expression of HBcAg and membranous HBsAg in HBV carriers superinfected with HDV, suggesting decreased HBV replication in the liver of these patients. 2) the changing of HBcAg and HBsAg expression in the liver of HDV-infected patients, suggest not so much a decrease but rather a modulation in HBV replication."
303,0.003,3.0,"Subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have increased risk for atherosclerosis. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) assessed using ultrasound and coronary artery calcium (CAC) detected using computed tomography predict cardiovascular risk in the general population; however, their usefulness and comparability in patients with HIV are less well defined. The purpose of this study was to compare IMT and CAC in the detection of atherosclerosis in subjects with HIV. CAC and IMT were measured in 253 HIV-infected and 58 uninfected adults. Associations among HIV-related factors, traditional risk factors, and CAC and IMT were evaluated. The distribution of IMT among subjects with and without CAC was compared. Among the patients with HIV, 37% had detectable CAC compared to 28% of controls (p = 0.19); 16% of the patients with HIV had CAC >100 compared to 5% of controls (p = 0.03). With either detectable or undetectable CAC, HIV-infected subjects had higher IMT compared to controls (1.02 ± 0.34 vs 0.78 ± 0.12 mm, p <0.0001), even after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Among those with undetectable CAC, 34% of patients with HIV had markedly increased IMT (≥1 mm) compared to no controls (p <0.0001). HIV-related factors were associated with IMT but not with CAC. In conclusion, patients with HIV and controls had similar rates of detectable CAC, while absolute CAC scores were modestly higher in the HIV group. Conversely, carotid IMT detected advanced subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with HIV even in the absence of CAC. Thus, with HIV, IMT is associated with disease-related factors and may be a more sensitive indicator of subclinical atherosclerosis than CAC."

5527,0.003,3.0,"To explore the relationship between absolute dendritic cell (DC) counts at the early stage of primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection (PHI) and subsequent disease progression, we performed a prospective study of 16 rapid progressors (RPs) and 12 typical progressors (TPs) from a PHI cohort of men who have sex with men. Significantly decreased plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and myeloid DC (mDC) counts in the blood of RPs were observed at study entry as compared with TPs and healthy HIV-1-negative subjects. Low baseline pDC counts were significantly associated with rapid disease progression after adjustment for baseline CD4(+) T cell counts, mDC counts, and HIV-1 load. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that low pDC counts were strongly associated with rapid disease progression. Our findings demonstrated the predictive value of blood absolute pDC counts at baseline in PHI for HIV-1 disease progression. Further studies are required to confirm this notion."

The incidence rate in China is escalating obviously. Currently there is lack of large samples and long-term systematic observations of ocular pathological changes in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected and AIDS patients. Diagnostic errors and missed diagnosis still exist in hospitals, even in some advanced hospitals. They delay the therapy of patients, also easily result in hospital acquired infections. It is notable that there is insufficient attention to preoperative test of anti-HIV in some hospitals, especially in outpatient surgeries. Therefore potential iatrogenic infection risks are hidden. Some clinical doctors are afraid of AIDS patients, therefore they are lack of subjective initiative to comprehensively examination and treatment the patients. For the past few years, highly active antiretroviral therapy is widely used, AIDS related morbidity and mortality is significantly reduced, and the prevalence rate of ocular complications decreased from 55% to 95%. But due to the HIV/AIDS patient volume increased year by year, and the survival rate raised, prolonged survival, results in the increase of the absolute number of patients with ocular complications. Therefore it is critical to pay attention to the HIV/AIDS ocular lesions in the diagnosis and treatment of iatrogenic infection. "

2019,0.003,3.0,"The main goal of the present paper was to analyze the molecular diversity of the principal neutralizing domain (V3 loop) of the HIV 1 gp120 in samples from patients of Argentina. The study was carried out on a total of 30 HIV 1 positive blood samples, obtained during 1991-1992, belonging to 15 intravenous drug users (group A), 5 homosexual men (group B), 8 children born to HIV 1 positive mothers (group C) and 2 AIDS patients (group D). By using extracted DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and from infected cells of the viral isolates in the case of the 2 AIDS patients, the V3 loop region was amplified by means of polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequencing by Sanger methodology was then performed on DNA fragments and nucleotide sequences obtained were translated into the correspondent amino acids. Consensus sequences for each group and a general consensus sequence were established (Table 1). Its alignment with V3 loop amino acid sequences of the major HIV 1 strains isolated worldwide is showed in table 2. Homology analysis between each sequence of the study population and sequence of different HIV 1 isolates showed that most of these samples share high homology with SF2 and BH10 strains. In contrast a low homology was found with JH3 and MN isolated (table 3). The presence of highly conserved amino acid residues as substitutions and insertions was determined in the Argentinian V3 loop sequences giving them a local pattern. The present paper is of great importance for our country, considering that the V3 loop is the main neutralizing domain becoming a major target in the development of HIV 1 vaccine. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the sequencing of the principal neutralizing domain of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 in Latin America."
5875,0.003,3.0,"The knowledge of being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) brings about psychological distress and social problems including anxiety, depression, and social isolation. Participating in psychosocial intervention programs can help to reduce these problems. To date, however, very little is known about the efficacy of different intervention strategies. We implemented a study with a randomized experimental design to investigate the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral group psychotherapy (CBT) and an experiential group psychotherapy (ET) program for 39 asymptomatic HIV-infected homosexual men. Both therapies consisted of 17 sessions over a 15-week period. The major finding of this study was that psychosocial intervention, independent of the therapeutic orientation, decreased distress significantly, as compared with a waiting-list control group (WCG). There were no significant changes in the intervention groups as compared with the WCG in coping styles, social support, and emotional expression. Finally, CBT and ET did not differ in their effects on psychological distress or on the other psychosocial variables measured in this study."
8468,0.003,3.0,"Recently, a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutant with HBe antigen-negative phenotype has been characterized, in which one TATA box-like motif of the precore/core promoter had degenerated: most frequently by both A-->T and G-->A mutations at positions 1762 and 1764, respectively. The clinical significance of this mutant is as yet unknown. In our present study, the T1762 A1764 mutant was sought in sera from HBV-infected blood donors and chronic liver disease patients by directly sequencing a PCR-amplified region of HBVDNA. Also, because the A1764 mutation generates a Sau3AI cleavage site (GGTC-->GATC), we digested the PCR products with Sau3AI to see if cleavage would occur at this specific site. Our results mostly corroborated the earlier report but we found a higher-than-predicted frequency of HBe antigen-positive blood donors positive for the mutant (22%). The titres of HBe antigen in these mutant-positive sera were slightly decreased compared to the titres in wild-type HBV infection. In addition, these blood donors had relatively high (though within the normal range) serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, suggesting that the T1762 A1764 mutation could be used as a sensitive laboratory marker for insidious hepatitis in these otherwise 'asymptomatic' carriers. The Sau3AI assay, which is much more convenient than sequencing, was shown to be useful for the detection of the T1762 A1764 mutant in an extensive number of clinical samples."

2626,0.003,3.0,"We have studied the roles of immunoprophylaxis, patient selection policy and coexistent hepatitis D virus infection in the outcome of 56 HBsAg-positive elective liver transplant recipients. Twenty-nine unselected patients not treated with immunoprophylaxis formed group 1 and were compared to a recent consecutive series of 27 patients (group 2) in whom pre-transplant serological status was determined and who received immunoprophylaxis. One-year actuarial HBsAg serological recurrence rates were 48% in group 2 and 90% in group 1 with particular improvement in recipients who were either HBV DNA-negative or who had co-existent hepatitis delta virus infection. One-year patient survival has improved from 62% in group 1 to 86% in group 2 with improvements in hepatitis delta virus-negative and replicating recipients. Patients who have either co-existent hepatitis delta virus infection or are in group 2 have 1-year survival rates comparable to elective HBsAg-negative recipients (19/21 (90%), 22/27 (86%) vs 87%, respectively). In the event of recurrence, severe graft injury is diminished in recent patients and in those with coexistent delta infection who also have lower levels of circulating HBV DNA. Retransplantation for associated graft injury has a poor prognosis irrespective of administration of immunoprophylaxis. In elective liver recipients, immunoprophylaxis and/or hepatitis delta virus infection modulate hepatitis B virus recurrence and associated graft injury with consequent improvement in patient survival."
6774,0.003,3.0,"Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) is highly prevalent worldwide. In some cases, it is a consequence of infection with variant viruses mutated in the S gene and producing a surface antigen not recognized by diagnostic kits. In most cases, OBI is due to a strong inhibition of hepatitis B virus (HBV) activities exerted by host defense mechanisms. OBI may reactivate in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy with the possibility of a consequent development of acute hepatitis that may lead to hepatic failure. Hematological malignancies and therapeutic schedules including rituximab are the conditions most frequently associated with OBI reactivation. However, this event may occur in a large number of additional clinical and therapeutic settings. Identification of patients prone to undergo reactivation is of great importance for promptly starting a proper antiviral therapy that may stop the HBV reactivation and prevent its clinical sequelae."
8806,0.003,3.0,"This study focused on dietary glycemic index because insulin resistance can be important in the pathogenesis of fat deposition in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We evaluated differences in past dietary glycemic intake between men with HIV who developed fat deposition and those who did not. This was a nested case-control study consisting of 37 cases and 37 controls from the Nutrition for Healthy Living cohort. Food records from 6 to 24 months prior to development of fat deposition in cases were analyzed and compared with controls. Cases were defined as men with a waist-to-hip ratio >0.95 and body mass index (calculated as kg/m(2)) between 23 and 26. Controls were matched by age, race, body mass index, highly active antiretroviral therapy use, and CD4 count. Food records were analyzed using t tests for normally distributed nutrients and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for nutrients with skewed distributions. Glycemic index was calculated for each meal and day. There was no significant difference in glycemic index for meals and day between participants with or without fat deposition. Both groups had a moderate dietary glycemic index intake. This study showed no association between dietary glycemic index and development of fat deposition in HIV. Instead, results of this study depict the potential benefits associated with eating high-quality diets, primarily adequate fiber and protein intake. Diet can be important in preventing development of fat deposition in patients with HIV."

This study aimed to describe the frequency of primary mutations associated with HIV-1 drug resistance and the prevalence of genetic HIV subtypes in a population of vertically infected children before the initiation of HAART. At the time of genotypic testing, the median age was 6.0 years (IQR 25-75%: 3.8-9.2) and the median age at admission was 3.84 years (IQR 25-75%: 1.23-6.11). Antepartum maternal ARV exposure for PMTCT occurred for three (7.3%) mothers. According to the WHO criteria, primary ARV resistance mutations were detected in four out of 41 (9.8%) children. Subtype B was the most prevalent (63.4%). The relatively high prevalence of primary HIV-1 DRMs in this cohort of perinatally infected children in Brazil supports the local recommendation to perform resistance testing in all newly diagnosed children, regardless of age at diagnosis and antenatal ARV exposure."
4703,0.003,3.0,"Injection drug use is a common route of infection for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the UK. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and force of infection for HBV among injecting drug users (IDUs) recruited from multiple community and drug agency settings in England and Wales between 1990 and 2004. Cross-sectional studies of IDUs in and out of contact with drug agencies were conducted throughout the 15-year period. Oral fluid samples were tested for antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between risk factors and anti-HBc positivity and force of infection models were explored. In total, 2527 injectors were recruited from community settings, and 29 386 from drug agencies. Anti-HBc prevalence was 31% (95% CI 30.7-31.8%). It declined in the early 1990s from around 50% in 1992 to 25% in 1999, after which it increased slightly. It was also higher in those who had injected for longer, older IDUs, those recruited in London and North West England, and those reporting having a previous voluntary confidential HIV test. The force of infection models suggested that the incidence of infection increased in 1999-2004 compared with 1993-1998, and was higher in new injectors compared with those injecting for > or =1 year. In conclusion, findings suggest ongoing HBV transmission in recent years despite an overall decline in prevalence in the early and mid-1990s, and highlight the importance of targeting vaccination programmes at new IDUs who have high incidence rates of infection."

Using qualitative data, this paper identifies potential lay social resources for support of PrEP adherence by HIV serodiscordant couples in Uganda, laying the groundwork for incorporation of these resources into adherence support initiatives as part of implementation. The qualitative analysis characterizes support for PrEP adherence provided by HIV-infected spouses, children, extended family members, and the larger community. Results suggest social resources for support of PrEP adherence in Africa are plentiful outside formal health care settings and health systems and that couples will readily use them. The same shortage of health professionals that impeded scale-up of antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS in Africa promises to challenge delivery of PrEP. Building on the treatment scale-up experience, implementers can address this challenge by examining the value of lay social resources for adherence support in developing strategies for delivery of PrEP."

Data analysis showed reflections that evidence the paradox in the AIDS epidemic: knowledge does not change behavior; gender relations; fear of death; fear of stigma; financial problems; disbelief in the virus' existence. Identifying beliefs and understanding how to influence the conduction of the health problem can help services to promote patients' adherence."
9328,0.003,3.0,"Chronic infection by Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) causes liver fibrosis, which is accelerated by unknown mechanisms in patients with HIV-1 coinfection. The evolution of HCV quasispecies in this setting of coinfection is not fully understood. To compare HCV quasispecies between HIV-HCV coinfection and HCV monoinfection, we sequenced 340 HCV clones from the HVR-1 and NS3 regions at two different time points in two groups of treatment-naïve patients with HCV-1a infection: (1) HIV-HCV positive (n=6); and (2) HIV negative-HCV positive (n=3). In HCV/HIV coinfection, we found a trend for reduced HCV genetic complexity and diversity, and a trend towards reduced dN/dS ratios in the HVR-1 region, especially in those patients with CD4<200cells/mm(3), who lost positive selective immune pressure in the HVR-1 region. Differences in immune regulation of HCV quasispecies in HIV coinfected individuals deserve further exploration to clarify the different outcomes of chronic hepatitis C noted between the immunocompromised and the immunocompetent host."
4327,0.003,3.0,"The rate of coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 or 2 and human lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type I or II was determined in Nigeria using 4153 human sera collected from different categories of people in 21 locations in the country. Eight (0.2%) of samples showed evidence of mixed infection with different combinations of HIV-1 or 2 and HTLV-I or II. One of the eight samples was positive for the four human retroviruses. Patients with other sexually transmitted diseases and those of sexually active age groups are more likely to be infected with multiple human retroviruses than other categories of people whose sera were tested. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between genders. The clinical and virological implications of this finding are discussed."
4738,0.003,3.0,"Opportunistic infections such as cryptosporidiosis and cyclosporiasis are commonly encountered in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We investigated the existence of opportunistic protozoans that significantly affect the quality of life in HIV-1 infected patients using conventional and molecular methods. The study group comprised 115 HIV-1 positive patients. In the identification of Cyclospora cayetanensis and Cryptosporidium, the formol-ether precipitation method was used and smears were evaluated in optical microscope by staining modified Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN). The primers and probes used for PCR were Heat shock protein 70 for C. cayetanensis and the oocysts wall protein for Cryptosporidium spp.. Cyclospora and Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were detected in one and two patients, respectively, by staining, whereas we detected C. cayetanensis in three patients out of 115 (2.6%) by PCR, and Cryptosporidium spp. in a further three patients (2.6%). C. cayetensis was detected in patients with CD4 counts of 64 cells/μm, 182 cells/μm and 287 cells/μm, respectively. Cryptosporidium spp. was detected in patients with CD4 counts of 176 cells/μm, 241 cells/μm and 669 cells/μm. As conclusion, PCR method is faster and more sensitive than microscopic methods and to screen intestinal pathogens routinely in patients infected with HIV should not be neglected in developing countries like Turkey."
430,0.003,3.0,"Because of the advent of highly effective treatments, routine screening for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been recommended for many Americans. This study explored the perceived barriers surrounding routine HIV and HCV screening in a diverse sample of community health centers (CHCs). The Community Health Applied Research Network (CHARN) is a collaboration of CHCs, with a shared clinical database. In July, 2013, 195 CHARN providers working in 12 CHCs completed a survey of their attitudes and beliefs about HIV and HCV testing. Summary statistics were generated to describe the prevalence of HIV and HCV and associated demographics by CHCs. HIV and HCV prevalence ranged from 0.1% to 5.7% for HIV and from 0.1% to 3.7% for HCV in the different CHCs. About 15% of the providers cared for at least 50 individuals with HIV and the same was true for HCV. Two-thirds saw less than 10 patients with HIV and less than half saw less than 10 patients with HCV. Less than two-thirds followed USPHS guidelines to screen all patients for HIV between the ages of 13 and 64, and only 44.4% followed the guidance to screen all baby boomers for HCV. Providers with less HIV experience tended to be more concerned about routine screening practices. More experienced providers were more likely to perceive lack of time being an impediment to routine screening. Many US CHC providers do not routinely screen their patients for HIV and HCV. Although additional education about the rationale for routine screening may be indicated, incentives to compensate providers for the additional time they anticipate spending in counseling may also facilitate increased screening rates."

The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of previous or occult HBV infection in a cohort of hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients with histologically advanced chronic hepatitis C in the United States who did or did not develop HCC. Stored sera from 91 patients with HCC and 182 matched controls who participated in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial were tested for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis B surface antibody, and HBV DNA. Frozen liver samples from 28 HCC cases and 55 controls were tested for HBV DNA by way of real-time polymerase chain reaction. Anti-HBc (as a marker of previous HBV infection) was present in the serum of 41.8% HCC cases and 45.6% controls (P=0.54); anti-HBc alone was present in 16.5% of HCC cases and 24.7% of controls. HBV DNA was detected in the serum of only one control subject and no patients with HCC. HBV DNA (as a marker of occult HBV infection) was detected in the livers of 10.7% of HCC cases and 23.6% of controls (P=0.18)."
7202,0.003,3.0,"Directly addressing HIV medication adherence and substance use together is ideal in light of the research on the complex connections between these two behaviors. This paper describes the development of a pilot program in which a combined motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy intervention was used to increase adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and reduce substance use in HIV-infected adults. The main goals of the pilot study were (1) to confirm the ability to recruit HIV-positive substance users taking HAART; (2) to demonstrate the ability to retain participants over the course of an eight-session intervention; and (3) to examine changes in substance use and HAART adherence from pretreatment to posttreatment. Twelve HIV-positive adults with a substance use disorder participated in an 8-week intervention, which consisted of weekly individual sessions with a trained therapist. Results showed that despite the small sample size, there was a significant reduction in substance use from pretreatment to posttreatment. No statistically significant differences were found for changes in HIV medication adherence, but the trends suggest the potential for positive results with a larger sample. Retention for all eight sessions of the treatment was 73.3%. Eighty percent completed the 3-month follow-up assessment. Participants reported high therapeutic alliance reflecting comfort with their therapists and in the treatment. Overall, the pilot demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the treatment. Furthermore, results suggest that this may, in fact, be an effective intervention to reduce substance use and improve HIV medication adherence."
6760,0.003,3.0,"The objective was to determine whether there is an association between carriage of oral yeasts, malnutrition and HIV-1 infection among Tanzanian children. A case-control study design within a cross-sectional study was used, and the outcome was carriage of oral yeasts. The exposure variables were malnutrition and HIV-1 antibody, and confounders to be adjusted for were age, sex, and breastfeeding. The study was carried out in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, in two maternal and child health (MCH) clinics that offer routine medical checkups to all expectant mothers and children aged between 0 and 5 years in the catchment area. A total of 882 children aged between 18 months and 5 years participated. Smears from the tongue and buccal mucosa were examined for oral yeasts. Malnutrition was categorized according to standards on the MCH chart and World Health Organization/Centers for Disease Control (WHO/CDC) standards as weight-for-height (wasted), weight-for-age (underweight), and height-for-age (stunted). HIV-1 infection was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reactive sera were confirmed by Western Blot. About 27% of the children were slightly or severely malnourished according to standards on the MCH chart. According to WHO/CDC standards, 2.6% were wasted, 16.3% were underweight, and 29.6% were stunted. Fourteen (1.6%) were seropositive for HIV-1 antibody. Hyphal forms and blastospores were much more frequent among children infected with HIV-1 with odds ratios ranging from 3.8 (95% CI: 1.3;11.2) to 6.2 (95% CI: 2.1;18.4) depending on categorization of malnutrition. Malnutrition was a risk factor, too, albeit to a much lesser and insignificant degree. The study supports our previous findings that malnutrition may predispose to carriage of oral yeasts and subsequent infection. However, in this study population HIV infection was clearly the predominant risk factor."
44,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels in plasma are currently widely used clinically for prognostication and in monitoring antiretroviral therapy. Accurate and reproducible results are critical for patient management. To determine the effects of specimen collection and handling procedures on quantitative measurement of HIV-1 RNA, we compared anticoagulants and sample processing times. Whole blood was collected from 20 HIV-1-infected patients in EDTA, acid citrate dextrose (ACD), and heparin tubes, aliquoted, and stored at room temperature. Plasma was separated from whole-blood aliquots prepared at < or =1, 3, 6, 24, and 48 h postcollection and then stored at -70 degrees C until use. HIV-1 RNA levels were determined by the AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR assay. Heparinized plasma samples, which were pretreated with heparinase prior to analysis, had the lowest baseline HIV-1 RNA levels. In the first 6 h, HIV-1 RNA levels decreased by 10, 20, and 31% in EDTA, ACD, and heparin tubes, respectively. From 6 to 48 h postcollection, HIV-1 RNA levels decreased in all anticoagulants, albeit at a slower, more consistent rate. Our results indicate that EDTA should be the anticoagulant of choice for plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement by reverse transcriptase PCR, but ACD tubes are acceptable if the plasma is separated within 6 h of blood collection. Caution must be applied in the interpretation of absolute HIV-1 RNA copy number values obtained with suboptimal specimen collection and processing procedures."
5021,0.003,3.0,"The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between the neurological manifestations of HIV infection, CD4+ lymphocyte count and the levels of HIV-1 RNA (viral load) in plasma. A total of 62 adult antiretroviral naïve HIV infected patients were enrolled in the study. Among them 26 had neurological complications of HIV infection (1st group), 16 patients had symptomatic disease without neurological involvements (2nd group) and 20 were asymptomatic patients (control group). Measurement of CD4 count was performed by indirect immunofluorescent assay by using the monoclonal antibodies and viral load (VL) in plasma--by RT PCR method. CD4 count was significantly lower in the 1st and 2nd group compared to the control group. There was correlation between the level of CD4 count and type of neurological manifestation. VL was comparable between the 1st and 2nd groups and was higher than in control group. There is a significant correlation between the level of CD4 count and type of neurological manifestation of HIV infection. Presence of neurological complication as well as other clinical manifestations is associated with decreased CD4 count and increased VL. Level of CD4 count can serve as an indicator for initiation of prophylaxis treatment of certain opportunistic pathogens."
7825,0.003,3.0,"Non invasive liver fibrosis scores have been proposed as alternatives to liver biopsy in hepatitis C virus (HCV) -infected patients. We assessed the impact of antiviral treatment on non invasive serological markers of liver fibrosis in HIV-HCV co-infected patients who received 48-weeks of HCV treatment. In HIV-HCV co-infected patients, HCV clearance was associated with a significant reduction in non invasive fibrosis serological markers, which most likely reflect the histological improvement associated with sustained virologic response. We assessed the association between insulin resistance, liver fibrosis, and liver steatosis in HIV-HCV and HCV-infected patients. Insulin resistance was associated with liver fibrosis and steatosis in HCV mono-infected but not in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Significant liver fibrosis was associated with insulin resistance independent of liver steatosis only in HCV mono-infected patients. We also assessed the impact of insulin resistance on the response to HCV therapy in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. A high HOMA-IR level was frequently found in HIV-HCV co-infected patients and was associated with a reduced sustained virologic response rate. Improving insulin sensitivity may be a useful adjunct to HCV therapy in HIV-HCV co-infected patients."

5823,0.003,3.0,"Nevirapine is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used as part of combination therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Nevirapine may be prescribed for patients with hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Significant autoinduction of cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2B6 following multiple dosing prompted an assessment of the metabolic profiles in patients with liver disease receiving chronic nevirapine therapy. HIV-infected patients with hepatic fibrosis who were receiving a stable antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine for > or = 6 weeks had liver biopsy specimens assessed by Ishak histologic scoring and were grouped by severity (group 1, Ishak scores of 1 and 2; group 2, Ishak scores of 3 and 4; group 3, Ishak scores of 5 and 6). Steady-state trough nevirapine levels were determined for all patients, and additional measurements were obtained at 1, 2, and 4 h following nevirapine dosing for a subset of patients. The pharmacokinetics of nevirapine and its five metabolites were characterized, and a comparison of the results for the different Ishak groups was performed. Among 51 patients with hepatic fibrosis, the majority of whom were coinfected with hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus, differences between the maximum and the minimum observed plasma concentrations demonstrated a statistically significant flattening of the systemic exposure curves with progression from Ishak group 1 to Ishak group 2 or 3, suggesting a decrease in systemic clearance with the progression of liver disease. However, there were no significant differences in the trough and the maximum nevirapine concentrations between the Ishak groups. The metabolite profiles were also comparable across the Ishak groups. In HIV-infected patients who were chronically treated with nevirapine and who had various degrees of hepatic fibrosis, including cirrhosis, trough plasma nevirapine concentrations were not significantly increased, and thus, no dose adjustment is warranted."
4070,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease in patients on hemodialysis. As no useful noninvasive predictors of disease activity and fibrosis have been found, liver biopsy is essential in these patients to accurately assess the severity of disease and thus the prognosis and plan management. The present study was undertaken to assess the degree of severity of necroinflammatory changes and fibrosis in liver biopsies of patients on hemodialysis with chronic HCV infection. Liver biopsies obtained from 45 patients on hemodialysis with serological evidence of chronic hepatitis C were studied. The grading of necroinflammatory activity and staging of fibrosis were histologically assessed. The majority of patients (30, i.e. 66.7%) had mild disease with mild inflammatory activity and stage 0, 1 or 2 fibrosis. There was no significant correlation between the degree of fibrosis and the age of the patients (rs = 0.015), the duration of hemodialysis (rs = 0.047) or the presence of steatosis (rs = 0.064). There was a positive correlation between the presence of bile ductular proliferation and the severity of fibrosis (rs = 0.612). It was concluded that chronic HCV infection in hemodialysis patients is relatively mild early in its course. However, serial follow-up liver biopsies are mandatory to plan appropriate intervention strategies."
2708,0.003,3.0,"The process of transcriptional activation directed by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) was investigated by in vivo footprinting using ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction in a human epithelial cell line infected with human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6). Infection with both viruses induces a remarkable enhancement in LTR-mediated gene expression that correlates with a change in the pattern of protein binding to the downstream kappa B site of the enhancer region. In HHV-6 infected cells, this change in the genomic footprinting pattern is concomitant with the induction of specific enhancer-binding proteins in the nucleus. The similarity of these events to those detected in other previously investigated experimental systems suggests that the LTR enhancer region is the ultimate target for the induction of the HIV-1 transcriptional response upon stimuli acting through different upstream pathways."
4202,0.003,3.0,"Little is known about the direct cytopathic effect of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its association with particular viral genotype or genetic mutation. In some immunosuppressed chronic HBV patients who had liver transplantation or HIV-coinfection, high viremia and liver fibrosis may occur. These findings suggest that hepatic injuries could arise in the absence of a mature immune system and the difference of genotype and/or specific mutation would affect cytopathic potential of the virus. We investigate HBV genotype-related differences in viral replication, antigens expression and histopathology using in vitro replication model or uPA/SCID mice harboring human hepatocytes, demonstrating that different HBV genotypes and even particular mutation are associated with different virological and histopathological characteristics. Infection with HBV/C2 as well as PC mutant of the HBV/B1 in immunosuppressive conditions can induce direct cytopathic effect in ""humanized"" part of the murine liver."
2302,0.003,3.0,"The genetic diversity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains has evolved through mutations such as point mutations, deletions or insertions, and recombination. We identified and characterized a novel type of mutation which is a complex of external insertion, deletion, and internal duplication in sequences from one of six patients with chronic hepatitis B virus genotype E (HBV/E). We provisionally named this mutation a ""replacement mutation""; the core promoter upstream regulatory sequence/basic core promoter was replaced with a part of the S1 promoter covering the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) binding site, followed by a tandem repeat of the HNF1 site. A longitudinal analysis of the HBV population over 6 years showed the clonal change from wild-type HBV/E to replacement-mutant type, resulting in a lower hepatitis B (HB) e antigen titer, a high HBV DNA level in serum, and progression of liver fibrosis. In an in vitro study using a replication model, the replacement-mutant HBV showed higher replication levels than the wild-type HBV/E replicon, probably mediated by altered transcription factor binding. Additionally, this HNF1 site replacement mutation was associated with excessive HB nucleocapsid protein expression in hepatocytes, in both in vivo and in vitro studies. This novel mutation may be specific to HBV genotype E, and its prevalence requires further investigation."
22,0.003,3.0,"Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 functions as a bimodal tether during lentiviral DNA integration: its C-terminal integrase-binding domain interacts with the viral preintegration complex, whereas the N-terminal PWWP domain can bind to cellular chromatin. The molecular basis for the integrase-LEDGF/p75 interaction is understood, while the mechanism of chromatin binding is unknown. The PWWP domain is homologous to other protein interaction modules that together comprise the Tudor clan. Based on primary amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structural similarities, 24 residues of the LEDGF/p75 PWWP domain were mutagenized to garner essential details of its function during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Mutating either Trp-21 or Ala-51, which line the inner wall of a hydrophobic cavity that is common to Tudor clan members, disrupts chromatin binding and virus infectivity. Consistent with a role for chromatin-associated LEDGF/p75 in stimulating integrase activity during infection, recombinant W21A protein is preferentially defective for enhancing integration into chromatinized target DNA in vitro. The A51P mutation corresponds to the S270P change in DNA methyltransferase 3B that causes human immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomaly syndrome, revealing a critical role for this amino acid position in the chromatin binding functions of varied PWWP domains. Our results furthermore highlight the requirement for a conserved Glu in the hydrophobic core that mediates interactions between other Tudor clan members and their substrates. This initial systematic mutagenesis of a PWWP domain identifies amino acid residues critical for chromatin binding function and the consequences of their changes on HIV-1 integration and infection."
5086,0.003,3.0,"Conceptually, blocking human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration is the last possibility for preventing irreversible cellular infection. Using cocultures of monocyte-derived dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cells, which represent primary targets in sexual transmission, we demonstrated that blocking integration with integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs), particularly L-870812, could consistently block cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 infection. In a pretreatment setting in which the compound was present before and during infection and was afterwards gradually diluted during the culture period, the naphthyridine carboxamide L-870812 blocked infection with the cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 Ba-L strain at concentrations of, respectively, 1,000 and 10,000 nM. The potency of L-870812 was similar to that of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor R-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl) adenine (PMPA) but one or two orders of magnitude lower than those of the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors UC781 and TMC120. In contrast, the diketo acid RDS derivative InSTIs showed clear-cut but weaker antiviral activity than L-870812. Moreover, L-870812 completely blocked subtype C and CRFO2_AG primary isolates, which are prevalent in the African heterosexual epidemic. Furthermore, the addition of micromolar concentrations of L-870812 even 24 h after infection could still block both cell-free and cell-associated Ba-L, opening the prospect of postexposure prophylaxis. Finally, an evaluation of the combined activity of L-870812 with either T20, zidovudine, PMPA, UC781, or TMC120 against replication-deficient HIV-1 Ba-L (env) pseudovirus suggested synergistic activity for all combinations. Importantly, compounds selected for the study by using the coculture model were devoid of acute or delayed cytotoxic effects at HIV-blocking concentrations. Therefore, these findings provide evidence supporting consideration of HIV-1 integration as a target for microbicide development."
1603,0.003,3.0,"Lentiviral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) show great promise as gene carriers for future gene therapy. Insertion of a fragment containing the central polypurine tract (cPPT) in HIV-1 vector constructs is known to enhance transduction efficiency drastically, reportedly by facilitating the nuclear import of HIV-1 cDNA through a central DNA flap. We have studied the impact of the cPPT on the kinetics of HIV-1 vector transduction by real-time PCR. The kinetics of total HIV-1 DNA, two-long-terminal-repeat (2-LTR) circles, and, by an Alu-PCR, integrated proviral DNA were monitored. About 6 to 12 h after transduction, the total HIV-1 DNA reached a maximum level, followed by a steep decrease. The 2-LTR circles peaked after 24 to 48 h and were diluted upon cell division. Integration of HIV-1 DNA was first detected at 12 h postinfection. When HIV-1 vectors that contained the cPPT were used, DNA synthesis was similar but a threefold higher amount of 2-LTR circles was detected, confirming the impact on nuclear import. Moreover, a 10-fold increase in the amount of integrated DNA was observed in the presence of the cPPT. Only in the absence of the cPPT was a saturation in 2-LTR circle formation seen at a high multiplicity of infection, suggesting a role for the cPPT in overcoming a barrier to the nuclear import of HIV-1 DNA. A major effect of the central DNA flap on the juxtaposition of both LTRs is unlikely, since transduction with HIV-1 vectors containing ectopic cPPT fragments resulted in increased amounts of 2-LTR circles as well as integrated DNA. Inhibitors of transduction by cPPT-containing HIV vectors were also studied by real-time PCR. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine (AZT) and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor alpha-APA clearly inhibited viral DNA synthesis, whereas integrase inhibitors such as the diketo acid L-708,906 and the pyranodipyrimidine V-165 specifically inhibited integration."
2587,0.003,3.0,"HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) activity has been suggested to correlate with protection from progression to AIDS. We have examined the relationship between HIV-specific CTL activity and maintenance of peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocyte counts and control of viral load in 17 long-term survivors (LTSs) of HIV-1 infection. Longitudinal analysis indicated that the LTS cohort demonstrated a decreased rate of CD4+ T cell loss (18 cells/mm3/year) compared with typical normal progressors (approximately 60 cells/mm3/year). The majority of the LTSs had detectable, variable, and in some individuals, quite high (>10(4) RNA copies/ml) plasma viral load during the study period. In a cross-sectional analysis, HIV-specific CTL activity to HIV Gag, Pol, and Env proteins was detectable in all 17 LTSs. Simultaneous analysis of HIV-1 Gag-Pol, and Env-specific CTLs and virus load in protease inhibitor-naive individuals showed a significant inverse correlation between Pol-specific CTL activity and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (p = 0.001). Furthermore, using a mixed linear effects model the combined effects of HIV-1 Pol- and Env-specific CTL activity on the viral load were significantly stronger than the effects of HIV-1 Pol-specific CTL activity alone on predicted virus load. These data suggest that the presence of HIV-1-specific CTL activity in HIV-1-infected long-term survivors is an important component in the effective control of HIV-1 replication."

6820,0.003,3.0,"Perceived social standing (PSS) was evaluated as a determinant of differences in health outcomes among Ugandan HIV-infected adults from Kampala using cross-sectional study design. PSS was defined using the MacArthur scale of subjective social status translated and adapted for the study setting. Socio-demographic and psychosocial correlates of PSS ranking at enrollment were determined using linear regression models. High versus low PSS was defined based on the median PSS score and evaluated as a determinant of body mass index, hemoglobin, quality of life (QOL) and frailty-related phenotype via linear regression. A log-binomial regression model estimated the relative-risk of good, very good or excellent versus fair or poor self-rated health (SRH) in relation to PSS. Older age, increasing social support and material wealth were correlated with high PSS ranking, whereas female sex, experience of multiple stigmas and multiple depressive symptoms were correlated with low PSS ranking. High PSS participants were on average 1.1 kg/m(2) heavier, had 4.7 % lower frailty scores and 3.6 % higher QOL scores compared to low PSS patients (all p < 0.05); they were also more likely to self-classify as high SRH (RR 1.4, 95 % confidence interval 1.1, 1.7) but had comparable hemoglobin levels (p = 0.634). Low PSS correlated with poor physical and psychosocial wellbeing in HIV-positive Ugandan adults. The assessment of PSS as part of clinical management, combined with efforts to reduce stigma and improve social support, may identify and possibly reduce PSS-associated health inequality in Ugandan adults with HIV."
6020,0.003,3.0,"Scaling up access to HIV viral load testing for individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy in low-resource settings is a global health priority, as emphasised by research showing the benefits of suppressed viral load for the individual and the whole population. Historically, large-scale diagnostic test implementation has been slow and incomplete because of service delivery and other challenges. Building on lessons from the past, in this Personal View we propose a new framework to accelerate viral load scale-up and ensure equitable access to this essential test. The framework includes the following steps: (1) ensuring adequate financial investment in scaling up this test; (2) achieving pricing agreements and consolidating procurement to lower prices of the test; (3) strengthening functional tiered laboratory networks and systems to expand access to reliable, high-quality testing across countries; (4) strengthening national leadership, with prioritisation of laboratory services; and (5) demand creation and uptake of test results by clinicians, nurses, and patients, which will be vital in ensuring viral load tests are appropriately used to improve the quality of care. The use of dried blood spots to stabilise and ship samples from clinics to laboratories, and the use of point-of-care diagnostic tests, will also be important for ensuring access, especially in settings with reduced laboratory capacity. For countries that have just started to scale up viral load testing, lessons can be learnt from countries such as Botswana, Brazil, South Africa, and Thailand, which have already established viral load programmes. This framework might be useful for guiding the implementation of viral load with the aim of achieving the new global HIV 90-90-90 goals by 2020."
5712,0.003,3.0,"Acute HIV-1 infection is often diagnosed as infectious mononucleosis and the symptoms resolve spontaneously after varying periods of time. After the infection of HIV-1 through the mucosa, the characteristic clinical symptoms and laboratory markers of acute HIV-1 infection appear in each patient through a complicated virus-host interaction. To understand the host responses, we measured two unique proinflammatory cytokines, galectin-9 (Gal-9) and osteopontin (OPN). A β-galactoside-binding mammalian lectin, Gal-9, reduces pro-inflammatory type-1 helper T (Th1) cells and Th17 cells and increases anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells. The plasma level of Gal-9 is known to be associated with HIV-1 viral load in chronic HIV-1 infection. On the contrary, osteopontin induces Th1/Th17 cells and promotes tissue inflammation. OPN is synthesized by variety of cells in the body, and dendritic cells are known to synthesize OPN in HIV-1 infected individuals. It was hypothesized that Gal-9 and/or OPN could be not only immune-modulators but also novel biomarkers of acute HIV-1 infection. We experienced 3 patients with acute HIV-1 and measured the levels of Gal-9 and OPN periodically before and after antiretroviral treatment. The results showed that the plasma levels of Gal-9 were extremely elevated [more than 2,300 pg/ml (normal range < 46 pg/ml)] in all three acute HIV-1 infected individuals and decreased rapidly after treatment. The changes in the OPN levels were less marked. In conclusion, the plasma levels of Gal-9 may be predictive of a severe inflammation status during the acute phase of HIV-1 infection and could be a potential biomarker during acute infection."

In order to assess this chemokine in central nervous system (CNS) HIV infection, we measured the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma concentrations of CXCL10 by immunoassay in samples derived from 97 HIV-infected subjects across a spectrum of immunological progression and CNS complications and from 16 HIV seronegative control subjects studied at three clinical centers between 1994 and 2001. We also examined changes in the CSF and plasma CXCL10 concentrations in 30 subjects starting and three stopping antiretroviral therapy. CSF CXCL10 concentrations: (1) correlated with CSF HIV RNA and white blood cell (WBC) counts, but not with blood CXCL10, HIV RNA, or CD4 counts; (2) were increased in subjects with primary and asymptomatic HIV infections and AIDS dementia complex, but less frequently in those with more advanced infection, with or without CNS opportunistic diseases except cytomegalovirus encephalitis; (3) decreased in subjects starting antiretroviral in association with decreases in CSF and plasma HIV RNA and CSF WBCs; and (4) conversely, increased in subjects stopping treatment in parallel with CSF HIV RNA and WBCs. These results confirm that CSF CXCL10 associates closely with both CSF HIV and WBCs and suggest that this chemokine may be both a response to and contributing determinant of local infection. High CSF levels may be useful in the diagnosis of ADC in subjects with advanced immunosuppression in whom CMV encephalitis has been ruled out, though this issue requires further study."
268,0.003,3.0,"HIV-1 disease is associated with pathological effects on T-cell production, destruction, and distribution. Using the deuterated (2H) glucose method for endogenous labeling, we have analyzed host factors that influence T-cell turnover in HIV-1-uninfected and -infected humans. In untreated HIV-1 disease, the average half life of circulating T cells was diminished without compensatory increases in cell production. Within 12 weeks of the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the absolute production rates of circulating T cells increased, and normal half-lives and production rates were restored by 12-36 months. Interpatient heterogeneity in the absolute degree of turnover correlated with the relative proportion of naive- and memory/effector-phenotype T cells in each of the CD4+ and CD8+ populations. The half-lives of naive-phenotype T cells ranged from 116-365 days (fractional replacement rates of 0.19-0.60% per day), whereas memory/effector-phenotype T cells persisted with half-lives from 22-79 days (fractional replacement rates of 0.87-3.14% per day). Naive-phenotype T cells were more abundant, and the half-life of total T cells was prolonged in individuals with abundant thymic tissue, as assessed by computed tomography. Such interpatient variation in T-cell kinetics may be reflective of differences in functional immune reconstitution after treatment for HIV-1 disease."
391,0.003,3.0,"Traditional healers provide healthcare to a substantial proportion of people living with HIV infection (PLHIV) in high HIV burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the impact on the health of retained patients visiting traditional healers is unknown. In 2011, a study to asses adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) performed in 18 purposefully selected HIV treatment centers in Tanzania, Zambia and Uganda showed that 'consulting a traditional healer/herbalist because of HIV' was an independent risk factor for incomplete ART adherence. To identify characteristics of PLHIV on ART who were also consulting traditional healers, we conducted a secondary analysis of the data from this study. It was found that 260 (5.8%) of the 4451 patients enrolled in the study had consulted a traditional healer during the last three months because of HIV. In multivariable analysis, patients with fewer HIV symptoms, those who had been on ART for >5.3 years and those from Tanzania were more likely to have consulted a traditional healer. However, at the time of the study, there was a famous healer in Manyara district, Loliondo village of Tanzania who claimed his herbal remedy was able to cure all chronic diseases including HIV. HIV treatment programs should be aware that patients with fewer HIV symptoms, those who have been on ART for five or more years, and patients attending ART centers near famous traditional healers are likely to consult traditional healers. Such patients may need more support or counseling about the risks of both stopping ART and poor adherence. Considering the realities of inadequate human resources for health and the burden of disease caused by HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, facilitating a collaboration between allopathic and traditional health practitioners is recommended."
4355,0.003,3.0,"We studied barriers to HIV care among HIV-positive Latinos in the US-Mexico border region, where HIV prevalence is increasing. HIV-positive participants receiving HIV care were recruited from clinics in Southern California and underwent structured interviews (n = 157). Logistic regression explored covariates associated with > or =1 barrier to HIV care. HIV-positive patients were mostly male (84.7%), of Mexican-origin (82.8%), and had a mean age of 37.3 years. Among males (n = 133), 67% identified as men who have sex with men. In the prior year, patients received the following care in Mexico: HIV care (33.1%), non-HIV care (43.3%), prescription medications (51.6%), and traditional medications/herbs (17.2%). The most common barriers to HIV care included stigma and medication side effects concerns. Factors independently associated with > or =1 barrier to HIV care were HIV diagnosis >1 year ago; being of Mexican-origin; crossing the US-Mexico border <5 times in the past year; obtaining medications in Mexico; and age. Findings illustrate that bi-national health care utilization is common, which has implications for HIV service delivery in both countries. Additional studies are needed to better understand individual, provider and system level barriers to HIV care in the San Diego/Tijuana border region."

However, it is technically difficult to demonstrate CTL responses consistently in nonhuman primate and human subjects using traditional cytotoxicity assay methods. In this study, we systematically evaluated culture conditions that may affect the proliferation and expansion of CTL effector cells and presented a sensitive method for detection of cytotoxicity responses with bulk CTL cultures. We confirmed the sensitivity and specificity of this method by demonstration of vigorous CTL responses in a simian-HIV (SHIV)-infected rhesus macaque. The expansion of epitope-specific CTL effector cells was also measured quantitatively by CTL epitope-major histocompatibility complex tetramer complex staining. In addition, two new T-cell determinants in the SIV gag region are identified. Last, we showed the utility of this method for studying CTL responses in chimpanzee and human subjects."
9020,0.003,3.0,"There is an increase in the cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity in individuals infected with HIV that may be due to inflammatory lipid modulation not captured by traditional lipid measures. The objective of this study was to perform advanced lipoprotein phenotyping inclusive of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol efflux capacity and lipoprotein particle concentration and size in a well-phenotyped group of 118 patients infected with HIV. We used simple and multivariable analyses to determine the associations between advanced lipoprotein parameters and known cardiometabolic risk factors. Participants were on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) and had benign traditional lipid panels [median total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides of 178 mg/dl, 108 mg/dl, 44 mg/dl, and 122.5 mg/dl, respectively]. However, advanced lipoprotein phenotyping demonstrated an elevation of LDL particle number (median of 1,233 nmol/liter) and a decrease in LDL size (median of 20.4 nm), along with a decrease in protective, large HDL particles (median of 3.15 μmol/liter) and reduced HDL cholesterol efflux capacity in comparison to controls of other studies. HDL cholesterol efflux capacity was associated with HDL levels (β=0.395, p<0.001), small LDL particle concentration (β=-0.198, p=0.031), insulin sensitivity by the Matsuda index (β=0.218, p=0.029), and the Framingham Risk Score (β=-0.184, p=0.046).

Awareness of HTLV-1 and related condition should be encouraged in this region and routine screening should be applied to blood donors.
525,0.003,3.0,"A health care worker (HCW) was infected via needlestick with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 from a subject with AIDS who harbored a zidovudine-resistant, syncytium-inducing (SI) HIV strain. The phenotypic characteristics of the HIV-1 isolates obtained from the HCW and markers of virus load were followed for 20 months. Although the HCW was initially infected with an SI strain, within 75 days of infection the isolate became non-SI and remained so for > or = 635 days. Even though the AIDS patient had a zidovudine-resistant virus, the HCW was infected with a zidovudine-sensitive virus. Plasma RNA levels peaked 20 days after infection, declined rapidly within 2 weeks, and remained stable for the duration of follow-up. Similarly, the HCW's CD4 lymphocyte count remained stable throughout the study. Thus, selection for non-SI and zidovudine-sensitive virus occurred in the HCW, who, after initial symptomatic infection associated with high levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA, developed low plasma RNA copy numbers and stable CD4 lymphocyte counts."
8674,0.003,3.0,"Malnutrition, skeletal muscle wasting, and changes in cardiac muscle mass and function have been described in children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This report analyzes the relation of nutritional status to cardiac muscle mass and function in HIV-infected children. Thirty-six children with symptomatic HIV infection underwent simultaneous anthropometric and echocardiographic evaluations before antiretroviral therapy or supplemental feedings. Nutritional measurements included weight, height, triceps skinfold thickness, and arm muscle circumference. Cardiac measurements included left ventricular mass, contractility, end-diastolic dimension, fractional shortening, blood pressure, and heart rate. In a cross-sectional analysis, children infected with HIV were significantly below age-adjusted standards for height (P = 0.0001), weight (P = 0.0001), triceps skinfold thickness (P = 0.001), and arm muscle circumference (P = 0.04). Left ventricular mass normalized to body surface area was below standard, but contractility was normal. Correlation analyses found an inverse relation between left ventricular mass and weight z score (r = -0.45, P = 0.01), height z score (r = -0.47, P = 0.006), and arm muscle circumference percentile (r = -0.51, P = 0.003). An inverse relation was also found between heart rate and weight z score (r = -0.47, P = 0.007) and arm muscle circumference percentile (r = -0.46, P = 0.007). In malnourished children with HIV infection, a paradoxical relation exists between nutritional status and cardiac muscle mass. The inverse relation between heart rate and nutritional status may suggest altered metabolic rates with possible increased sympathetic tone."

1502,0.003,3.0,"The risk of mycobacterial disease is significantly increased in drug abusers as well as in immunocompromised HIV-1-infected individuals. The essential trace element selenium has an important function in maintaining immune processes and may, thus, have a critical role in clearance of mycobacteria. The impact of selenium status on the development of mycobacterial diseases in HIV-1-seropositive drug users was investigated over a 2-year period (1999-2001). Twelve cases of mycobacterial disease (tuberculosis, 9; infection due to atypical Mycobacterium species, 3) occurred; these 12 cases were compared with 32 controls with no history of respiratory infections who were matched on age, sex, and HIV status. Significant risk for development of mycobacterial disease was associated with a CD4 cell count of <200/mm 3, malnutrition, and selenium levels of <or=135 microg/L (patients with these levels were 13 times more likely to develop mycobacterial disease). Multivariate analyses controlling for antiretroviral treatment and CD4 cell count revealed that both body mass index and selenium level remained significant factors in the relative risk for developing mycobacterial disease (relative risk, 3; p =.015); these findings suggest that selenium status may have a profound impact on the pathogenesis of mycobacterial disease."
4145,0.003,3.0,"CR2 (CD21), the EBV receptor, was detected on three of four CD4-positive cell lines by indirect fluorescent labeling, and its corresponding mRNA was found by use of the reverse transcription-based polymerase chain reaction. To determine whether CR2 on CD4-positive cells was functional, their ability to be infected by EBV was analyzed. EBV DNA, EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2A), and EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER1) transcripts could be detected in CR2-expressing CD4-positive cells following infection by the B95.8 strain of EBV. Analysis of the terminal region showed the EBV genome remained linear following infection, and copy number decreased with time. Since CD4-positive cell lines are targets for HIV-1 infection, the effects of EBV infection on HIV-1 expression were analyzed. HIV-1 replication was upregulated when CD4-positive cells were coinfected with EBV strain B95.8 but not P3HR-1K. These results suggested that EBNA-2 is involved in upregulation of HIV-1 expression in T lymphoblastoid cell lines. To test this hypothesis an EBNA-2-expression vector was transfected into T lymphoblastoid cell lines and HIV-1 expression measured. First, trans-activation of HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by Tat was enhanced by EBNA-2 type 1 expression. trans-Activation of the HIV-1 LTR by Tat was also enhanced when CD4-positive cells were infected by EBV (strain B95.8) encoding an intact EBNA-2, but not by P3HR-1K with a deleted EBNA-2. In addition, CD4-positive cell clones stably expressing EBNA-2 supported enhanced HIV-1 replication as measured by accumulation of reverse transcriptase activity and syncytium induction. This provides direct evidence that EBV infection can enhance HIV-1 replication in T cells. Whether this in vitro phenomenon contributes to disease progression in vivo remains to be determined."
2433,0.003,3.0,"A region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp 120 has been claimed previously to be homologous to parts of snake venom neurotoxins and rabies virus glycoprotein (""the neurotoxic loop""). We have determined DNA sequences directly from a polymerase chain reaction amplified fragment corresponding to this region of HIV-1 gp 120 and have translated these to protein sequences. This was performed with the prototype HIVSF2 isolate and several Swedish HIV-1 strains, which were precultivated from blood cells or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or were directly obtained from CSF cells of patients with and without neurological symptoms. The results show that there are sequence similarities between a short segment of gp120 of clinical HIV-1 strains and the neurotoxic loop. The strains of patients with neurological symptoms did not, however, show a genetic shift of their sequences towards a greater similarity to the sequences of snake venom neurotoxins and rabies virus glycoprotein as compared to the strains of asymptomatic individuals."
2489,0.003,3.0,"The T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of 24 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected children were determined by flow cytometry in combination with sequencing of the highly variable TCR complementarity-determining region 3, permitting a quantitative and qualitative assessment of TCR repertoire. Expanded subsets of CD8(+) cells expressing a particular TCR beta-chain variable region were more commonly identified in HIV-1-infected children than in healthy control subjects (75% vs. 13.5%; P<.0001). Older age and lower percentage of CD4(+) cells were correlated with expansions. Oligoclonal populations occupied 71%-95% of each expanded subset, and predominant clones had high absolute counts. There was evidence of functional differentiation to CD28(-) effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and cells bearing identical TCRs were identified in both CD28(+) and CD28(-) cell populations. HIV-1 specificity was observed for expanded clones. Children with expansions were not more likely to have increased numbers of CD8(+) T cells, a finding consistent with the possibility that the CD8(+) TCR repertoire has limited diversity."

We aimed to describe the epidemiological, virological and clinical characteristics of HBV infections newly diagnosed in 2011 in University hospitals of Marseille, the second largest French city. HBV serology was performed for 18,130 sera from 15,744 patients. A total of 167 patients were newly-diagnosed with HBV based upon the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis B core antibodies. Clinico-epidemiological features were analyzed for 78 patients. Patients included a majority of men (59%), women being significantly younger with a mean age of 36 ± 17 versus 43.5 ± 16.2 years (P = 0.009). Country of birth was available for 52 patients and 35% of them originated from sub-Saharan Africa. Levels of the liver biological parameters were significantly lower in women compared to men, in whom mean alanine aminotransferase and gammaglutamyl transferase levels were 24 ± 39 versus 37 ± 36 IU/l (P = 0.0001) and 20 ± 20 versus 51 ± 53 IU/l (P = 0.0001), respectively. Co-infections with hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency viruses were found in 5% and 6% of the patients, respectively. HBV DNA was detectable in 90% of the HBeAg-negative patients. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the HBsAg titer and the HBV DNA level (P = 0.001). Genotype D was the most common HBV genotype and was found in 53% of the patients tested, followed by genotype E (21%). HBV remains a major concern with a slightly greater number of new diagnoses than in 2004. HBV genetic diversity was substantial in the present cohort."
6976,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence of intrahepatic delta antigen and/or anti-delta antibody was retrospectively investigated in 102 children with chronic HBsAg-positive hepatitis who were seen consecutively in three medical institutions between 1974 and 1982. Delta infection markers were found in 13 patients (12.7%) who exhibited high serum titers of anti-delta antibody; intrahepatic delta antigen was detected in ten. Eleven of the 13 children had severe progressive liver disease associated in all but one with absence of hepatitis B virus replication as evaluated by analysis of serum hepatitis B virus DNA. The factors which seem to increase the risk of delta infection in children who are hepatitis B virus carriers are geographic origin, a history of exposure to blood derivatives and age. A further 37 of 102 children had chronic active hepatitis (20 patients) or cirrhosis (17 patients) without evidence of delta infection. These results indicate that delta infection occurs in children with chronic hepatitis. This possibility should be considered in investigation of children with HBsAg-positive chronic liver disease. Although the delta agent is an important cause of progressive liver disease in children who are chronic HBsAg carriers, severe liver injury and especially cirrhosis can occur without evidence of delta infection."

This study sought to determine the prevalence of TB among HIV-positive attendees of the Directly Observed Treatment of Short Course (DOTS) program at the military hospital in Port Harcourt. The association of HIV prevalence with gender and age as risk factors was also determined. A total of 200 patients aged 15-65 years were screened. Re-screening for HIV was done for confirmation. The overall prevalence for anti-TB antibodies amongst HIV-positive individuals was 14.0% (7.5% in males and 6.5% in females) while HIV prevalence following re-screening was 92%. It was observed that based on employment status and level of education, the highest HIV prevalence was seen in unemployed individuals and individuals with no formal education. The result showed that 29.9% of the HIV seropositives were males while 70.1% were females. Sex-related prevalence of HIV-TB coinfection within groups indicated significantly higher co-infection rates (P < 0.05) among males (23.1%) than females (9.6%). Age-related prevalence of HIV-TB coinfection within groups showed that co-infection was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in ages below 30 years (21.2%) than in their counterparts 30 years and above (9.6%). This study confirmed the presence of TB co-infections among HIV-positive individuals in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Considering the role of TB in driving the HIV pandemic, it is imperative that HIV-positive patients are screened for TB infection regularly to reduce the scale of active HIV-TB co-infection."
6067,0.003,3.0,"Chronic coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with adverse liver outcomes. The clinical impact of previous HBV infection on liver disease in HCV infection is unknown. We aimed at determining any association of previous HBV infection with liver outcomes using antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb) positivity as a marker of exposure. The Scottish Hepatitis C Clinical Database containing data for all patients attending HCV clinics in participating health boards was linked to the HBV diagnostic registry and mortality data from Information Services Division, Scotland. Survival analyses with competing risks were constructed for time from the first appointment to decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related mortality. Records of 8513 chronic HCV patients were included in the analyses (87 HBcAb positive and HBV surface antigen [HBsAg] positive, 1577 HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative, and 6849 HBcAb negative). Multivariate cause-specific proportional hazards models showed previous HBV infection (HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative) significantly increased the risks of decompensated cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01-1.65) and HCC (HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.09-2.49), but not liver-related death (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.80-1.30). This is the largest study to date showing an association between previous HBV infection and certain adverse liver outcomes in HCV infection. Our analyses add significantly to evidence which suggests that HBV infection adversely affects liver health despite apparent clearance. This has important implications for HBV vaccination policy and indications for prioritization of HCV therapy."
7302,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence and associated factors of erectile dysfunction (ED) in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected men remain controversial. The authors evaluated ED, clinical, and emotional variables in a group of 501 HIV-infected men in a cross-sectional 4-month observational study. ED was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function-5 and emotional status using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire. Median age (interquartile range) was 42 (35, 48) years. Time since HIV diagnosis was 6.3 (2.6, 17.1) years, 92% were taking antiretroviral treatment and 81.8% had an HIV-RNA viral load <50 copies. The prevalence of ED was 58.5%. ED was mild in 30.1%, mild to moderate in 19.5%, moderate in 6.1%, and severe in 2.5%. ED medications were used by 19% of men. In the univariate analysis, the variables associated with all degrees of ED were older age, longer time since HIV diagnosis, higher scores in HAD, not taking efavirenz, taking etravirine, taking ritonavir, HIV/Hepatitis C Virus coinfection, and taking a protease inhibitor-containing regimen. For mild to moderate, moderate, and severe ED, the same variables were significant, as were lower nadir CD4 cell count, lower social support, taking atazanavir, concomitant conditions, and concomitant treatments. The variables that remained significant in the multivariate analyses, considering all degrees of ED or excluding mild ED were the following: older age and higher scores in HAD total. In summary, ED affected more than half of this cohort of well controlled HIV-infected men. Age and emotional status seemed to play a fundamental role in its presence."

4457,0.003,3.0,"Viruses have been found to exhibit protein kinase activity associated with their purified viral particles. HIV-1 virus particles possess a novel 72 kD protein, Topoisomerase II beta kinase (Topo IIβKHIV) activity. The enzyme, isolated and purified from PEGprecipitated HIV-1 particles, is insensitive against a diverse set of known kinase inhibitors. The pyridine derivatives were found to be active against both Topo IIβKHIV activity and HIV-1 replication. For both kinase antagonism and anti-HIV-1 activity the Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) models were proposed. The CoMFA model was also evaluated independently with a set of test molecules for their anti-viral activity. The kinase inhibition and anti-viral activities for these inhibitors, tested in an in vitro kinase agree with the CoMFA model (cross-validated r2 (q2) value of 0.642 with six principal components), lower acceptable results are obtained with anti- HIV-1 activity (cross-validated r2 (q2) value of 0.358 with four principal components) and also correlate with relative solvation free energy calculations. The predictive power of the models was evaluated with 2 test molecules each and tends to lie within 1 log unit. An in cell validation of the model with a representative inhibitor, 2-methoxypyridine shows its ability to inhibit Topo IIβ phosphorylation during acute HIV-1 infection. Close correlation of molecular fields of inhibitory domains of kinase and HIV-1 inhibitors suggests specificity of action of pyridine derivatives in affecting HIV-1 replication through inhibition of Kinase activity. These investigations suggest that Topo IIβKHIV is a potential target for an effective control of HIV-1 replication that would help in developing new anti-retroviral molecules. "

In combination with other proven HIV-prevention methods, preexposure prophylaxis may be a useful tool for women at the highest risk of HIV acquisition. Obstetrician-gynecologists involved in the care of women using preexposure prophylaxis must reinforce adherence to daily medication. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance for preexposure prophylaxis is likely to evolve in the coming years, and obstetrician-gynecologists should remain aware of new developments in this area.

1326,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X-gene product activates transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under control of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR). To identify a cis-acting regulatory sequence within the HIV-1 LTR which is responsive to the HBV X-gene trans-activating function, we examined the effects of HBV X-gene expression in cells with a series of LTR/CAT deletion mutants. A region of the HIV-1 LTR containing the previously identified kappa B-like enhancer element was found to be responsive to HBV X-gene activation, and this effect was independent of, and additive with, the effect of the HIV-1 tat-III protein on CAT expression. Since kappa B-like enhancer sequences are known to regulate transcription of a variety of viruses and cellular genes, our results suggest that the X gene could activate such a gene during HBV infection and replication."
1321,0.003,3.0,"Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) X-gene, previously shown to be capable of trans-activating heterologous regulatory elements of the human beta-interferon gene, the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR), the simian virus 40 (SV40), and HBV, has the capacity to code for a 17-kDa polypeptide (designated pX17). We now report that pX17 synthesized in Escherichia coli can activate transcription controlled by the HIV-1 LTR using a protoplast fusion technique. Protoplasts of E. coli-containing presynthesized X-protein were fused with lymphocytic H938 cells harboring an integrated copy of a plasmid with the CAT gene under control of the HIV-1 LTR (HIV-1 LTR CAT) and a marked increase in the steady state expression of the CAT mRNA was observed. When the same fused cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide, the pX17-dependent activation of the HIV-1 LTR was abolished. This result indicates that the X-protein expressed in E. coli is biologically active and suggests that the HBV X-protein-mediated trans-activation of the HIV-1 LTR in this system requires de novo cellular protein synthesis."

We observed a case of genotypic ETVr with viral and biochemical breakthrough during ETV treatment of nucleoside-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A 57-years-old HBeAg-positive man received ETV 0.5 mg/day for 145 weeks. HBV DNA was 7.7 log10 copies/ml at baseline, decreased to below 2 at week 48, declined to a nadir of 0 (negative) at week 72, and rebounded to 2.2 log10 copies/ ml at week 90 and remained this level until 109 weeks and increased to 6.8 log10 copies/ml at week 145. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level increased to 440 IU/L at week 145. The ETVr-related substitution (rtS202P) and lamivudine resistance-related substitutions (rtL180M+rtM204V) were detected by DNA sequencing analysis at week 145. The patient discontinued ETV therapy at week 145, and then received 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Afterwards, HBV DNA level dropped to below 2.6 log10 copies/ml and ALT level was normalized after 19 weeks of TDF dosing. The three substitutions associated with ETV and lamivudine resistance developed after complete viral suppression in a nucleoside-naive CHB patient during ETV treatment. In spite of the extremely rare chance of viral mutation during ETV treatment, nucleoside-naive patients should be carefully monitored for resistance even if complete suppression is present."
5867,0.003,3.0,"Lamivudine is a safe, effective treatment for hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation after renal transplantation. However, prolonged lamivudine therapy can produce resistance to the drug. Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) has demonstrated efficacy in patients with lamivudine resistance, but there is limited clinical experience in patients with either renal transplants or severe renal insufficiency. A 47-year-old man with asymptomatic HBV infection underwent renal transplantation in November 1995. In September 2000 lamivudine therapy was initiated to treat HBV reactivation. The outcome was good, with negative HBV DNA levels. Two years later, significant viral replication developed again. At that time the patient already had advanced renal insufficiency due to chronic graft nephropathy. The transaminase levels were increased, and the HBV DNA reached greater than 200,000 copies/mL by polymerase chain reaction, with development of ascites and cirrhosis. The patient was started on ADV 10 mg every 72 hours (dose adjusted to renal function). There was rapid normalization of hepatic enzymes and progressive decline of the viral load. HBV DNA became negative after 6 months of ADV treatment. The renal function has since remained stable. This case suggests that ADV can be safe and effective in the treatment of renal transplant patients with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B, even in the presence of advanced renal insufficiency."
5393,0.003,3.0,"Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. The etiology of liver cancer is multifactorial, and infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), whose pathogenesis is exacerbated by the acquisition of mutations that accelerate carcinogenesis, or hepatitis C virus (HCV) and dietary exposure to aflatoxin B(1) all contribute to elevating one's risk for this disease. In this study, we sought to determine the contributions of these agents by measuring the occurrence of an HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) double mutation, an aflatoxin-specific 249(G-->T) mutation of the p53 gene, and HCV in plasma of 34 HCC cases and 68 age- and gender-matched controls, and in 25 liver tumors from northern Thailand. In total, 14 cases, 5 controls, and 19 tumors had detectable levels of HBV DNA. All 14 cases, 2 controls (2.9%), and 17 tumors (89.5%) were positive for the HBV double mutation. Nine cases (26.5%), 10 controls (14.7%), and 6 tumors (24%) were positive for the p53 mutation. Five cases (14.7%), no controls, and 4 tumors (16%) had both mutations. The median age of HCC diagnosis in these 5 cases was 34 years versus 51 years for other cases. Five cases (14.7%) and 1 control (1.5%) were HCV enzyme immunoassay positive. Thus, specific HBV, HCV, and aflatoxin biomarkers reveal the complexity of risks contributing to HCC in northern Thailand and suggest further application of these biomarkers as intermediate end points in prevention, intervention trials, and etiologic investigations."

Recent studies have associated HIV infections in Kenya with several invasive health care and cosmetic procedures. To explore the various blood exposures that could contribute to HIV infections in Kenya, we surveyed 320 adolescents and adults aged 15-29 years from the Luo and Kisii ethnic groups. Survey participants reported a wide range of invasive procedures in health care (including circumcisions, dental care, blood tests, and 1-60 injections or infusions for specific health problems), in cosmetic services (including tattooing and piercing) and around the home (through shaving body hair, fights, sports and other activities). Luo were significantly more likely than Kisii to report some risks (e.g. tattooing by a traditional expert, piercing), but less likely to report others (e.g. blood tests for malaria, anaesthetic injections during circumcision)."
1004,0.003,3.0,"Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results in gradual immunosuppression due to the loss of CD4+ T cells. In the wake of immune system breakdown, infected individuals may acquire multiple opportunistic infections and develop certain malignancies which ultimately account for the vast majority of deaths in these persons. A limited number of malignancies are directly associated with HIV infection and suggest a common tie between these tumors. Inappropriate immune surveillance resulting in insufficient inhibition of virus replication and inadequate control of the growth of transformed cells may contribute to the development of malignancies in HIV-infected individuals. Alternatively, malignancies in HIV infection may be the consequence of immune dysregulation. Cellular immune responses mediated by antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are of particular importance for immunologic control of viral infections and substantial information has been gathered about theses cells in HIV infection. The goal of this review is therefore to summarize recent findings regarding the cellular immune response to HIV with a particular focus on cytokines released by HIV-specific CTL."
826,0.003,3.0,"Heterosexual transmission by vaginal intercourse accounts for most transmission of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) in Africa and Asia but is less important in the HIV-1 epidemics of the United States and Western Europe. Epithelial Langerhans' cells (LCs) represent a possible source of initial cell contact for vaginal infection. Fifteen primary isolates of HIV-1 from U.S. homosexuals and 18 HIV-1 isolates from Thailand heterosexuals were evaluated for growth in LCs of U.S. origin. All the viruses from the Thai heterosexuals, which were subtype E, grew more efficiently in the LCs than any of the viruses from the U.S. homosexuals, which are subtype B. These results suggest that LC tropism is associated with the efficiency of heterosexual transmission of HIV."
4356,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus genotype 4 (HCV-G4) is prevalent in the Middle East and Africa and has spread to several regions in Europe. HCV-G4 represents a major health problem in Egypt, with a prevalence rate of 13%. Recently, HCV-G4 has been spreading in Europe particularly among intravenous drug users (IDU) populations, who represent the main reservoir for HCV in Europe. This article reviews the current therapeutic strategies for HCV-G4 infections in different populations. HCV-G4 has been considered a difficult-to-treat genotype because of the poor sustained virological response (SVR) rates reported with a conventional interferon (IFN)-based regimen. Pegylated IFN and ribavirin combination therapy was associated with significant improvements in SVR rates that currently exceed 60%, particularly with individualized therapy. Lower response rates have been reported in specific situations, namely chronic HCV-G4 infection in IDUs and patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Rapid and early virological responses have been useful tools for determination of the duration of therapy."
3823,0.003,3.0,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at a high risk for exposure to pathogens in the workplace. The objective of this study was to evaluate HCW adherence to follow-up after occupational exposure to blood and body fluids at a tertiary care university hospital in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Data were collected from 2102 occupational exposures to blood and body fluids reports, obtained from the Infection Control Division of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo/Escola Paulista de Medicina/Hospital São Paulo, in São Paulo, Brazil, occurring between January of 2005 and December of 2011. To evaluate adherence to post-exposure follow-up among the affected HCWs, we took into consideration follow-up visits for serological testing. For HCWs exposed to materials from source patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as from source patients of unknown serological status, follow-up serological testing was scheduled for 3 and 6 months after the accident. For those exposed to materials from source patients co-infected with HIV and HCV, follow-up evaluations were scheduled for 3, 6, and 12 months after the accident. During the study period, there were 2056 accidental exposures for which data regarding the serology of the source patient were available. Follow-up evaluation of the affected HCW was recommended in 612 (29.8%) of those incidents. After the implementation of a post-exposure protocol involving telephone calls and official letters mailed to the affected HCW, adherence to follow-up increased significantly, from 30.5 to 54.0% (P = 0.028). Adherence was correlated positively with being female (P = 0.009), with the source of the exposure being known (P = 0.026), with the source patient being HIV positive (P = 0.029), and with the HCW having no history of such accidents (P = 0.047). Adherence to the recommended serological testing was better at the evaluation scheduled for 3 months after the exposure (the initial evaluation) than at those scheduled for 6 and 12 months after the exposure (P = 0.004). During the study period, there was one confirmed case of HCW seroconversion to HCV positivity. The establishment of a protocol that involves the immediate supervisor of the affected HCWs, in the formal summoning of those HCWs is necessary in order to increase the rate of adherence to post-exposure follow-up.

4910,0.003,3.0,"Patients with human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV)-infection have a high prevalence of abnormal bone metabolism and vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D treatment has some benefit in patients with HIV infection. In this paper, we review the evidence for an association between vitamin D and HIV infection. Literature search was done from Medline. Genetic studies have provided the opportunity to determine which proteins link vitamin D to HIV pathology [i.e., the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, vitamin D receptor, cytochrome P(450), renin-angiotensin system, apoli-poprotein E, liver X receptor, toll-like receptor, poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase-1, natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1, and the Sp1 promoter gene]. Vitamin D also exerts its effect on HIV through nongenomic factors, i.e., ultraviolet radiation exposure, matrix metalloproteinase, heme oxygenase-1, the prostaglandins, cyclooxygenase-2, and oxidative stress. In conclusion, vitamin D may have a beneficial role in HIV. Calcitriol, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 should be tested in HIV-infected population because of its active form of the vitamin D3 metabolite and modulates inflammatory cytokine expression. Further investigation with calcitriol in HIV is needed."
6338,0.003,3.0,"To explore the mechanisms underlying liver-directed autoimmune reactions in acute Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection, we followed five subjects who were identified in the early incubation phase (30-70 days before the first elevation of transaminases). We assessed serially cellular (using a T-lymphocyte migration inhibitory factor assay) and humoral (RIA) immunity to LSP (a macromolecular, liver-derived lipoprotein complex) and hepatic lectin (HL), the liver-specific receptor for desialylated glycoproteins, which appears to be a major target antigen for autoreactions in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis. Anti-LSP and anti-HL autoantibodies were found, at some stage during acute HBV infection, in 4/5 subjects, whereas cellular immunity to the same antigens was detected in only two patients. Sustained production of anti-HL antibodies was noted only in patients showing cellular immunity to this antigen and was apparently secondary to liver damage, whereas anti-LSP antibodies were first detected at the onset of liver injury when there was no evidence of T-cell immunity to the same antigenic complex. One explanation for this apparent dichotomy between cellular and humoral responses to LSP is that a helper T-cell response to the major envelope component of HBV, HBsAg, which precedes by 10-20 days the development of anti-LSP antibodies, promotes a humoral reaction to autoantigens contained in the LSP preparation, coexpressed with HBsAg, on the surface of infected hepatocytes."
7393,0.003,3.0,"The selenium concentration in the serum of 67 patients with HIV infection was measured to determine whether selenium deficiency occurred in the different stages of the disease. In the first stage of the study, patients were divided into four groups: symptom-free subjects, PGL (persistent generalized lymphadenopathy), ARC (AIDS related complex), and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Selenium concentrations were normal in HIV antibody positive symptom-free subjects (1.18 +/- 0.27 mumol/L) and lower than normal in the other three groups (p less than 0.001). There was a significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between selenium levels and values of hemoglobin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Selenium deficiency was in no case associated with a lack of zinc in serum (also determined in all patients). In the second stage of the study, 12 patients were treated for a period of two months with low doses of selenium to assess whether such supplementation was able to restore their impaired immunological and hematological functions. The therapy increased serum selenium concentrations (from 0.77 +/- 0.23 to 1.44 +/- 0.41 mumol/L) and symptomatic improvements were noted. However, no changes were observed in the immunological and hematological parameters."
3384,0.003,3.0,"An unusual hepatitis B virus (HBV) variant, assigned provisionally to genotype I, was recently reported, characterized by an anomalous genotyping pattern and putative recombination; however, the natural history of this unusual strain is unknown. This study analyzed longitudinal sera collected over a 9-year period from a patient infected with this variant to investigate the clinical profile and intrahost viral evolution over time. The patient, who had immigrated to Canada in 1998 from Vietnam, was treated with lamivudine in 2000. Approximately 4-5 years following the withdrawal of lamivudine therapy, a genomic ""shift"" occurred coincident with ALT flares and increasing HBV viral load, resulting in numerous stable nucleotide substitutions within the core coding region, suggesting altered immune control that may provide a selective advantage to the virus. Analysis of quasispecies diversity over time demonstrated further this shift, with two sequence clusters associated with time points either prior to or following relapse observed, including increased diversity among quasispecies prior to relapse. In keeping with the complex nature of genotype I strains, majority population genomes had a mean genetic distance from genotype C of 7.6 +/- 0.1%, although large genomic segments lacked significant homology with any HBV genotype. Further study is needed to understand the evolutionary origin and natural history of infection with this unique HBV variant."

1167,0.003,3.0,"The protease gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) clinical isolates found in 15 immigrants (most of African origin) living in Spain was examined. Phylogenetic analyses were performed, taking as reference a panel of 26 HIV protease gene sequences deposited with GenBank. All specimens belonged to four distinct HIV-1 non-B subtypes: C (three cases), F (one), G (nine), and H (two). Five patients harboring subtype G strains were further classified within the IbNg recombinant clade. A high degree of genetic polymorphism at the protease gene was seen in all subtypes. Moreover, changes at positions associated with drug resistance were seen in subtype G viruses carried by patients who had not been exposed to protease inhibitors. Plasma viremia was lower than expected for some samples, according to the clinical features and the CD4+ cell count, suggesting that viral load titers were underestimated by all three commercially available techniques. This work represents the first genetic characterization of subtypes C, F, G, and H in Spain."
2271,0.003,3.0,"HIV infection has now been consistently identified as the major cause of death in young Africans in both urban and rural areas. In Africa, several studies have defined the clinical presentation of HIV disease but there have only been a limited number of autopsy studies. Because of the scarcity of autopsy data and the possibility of differing type and frequency of opportunistic infections between different geographic locations we set out to study consecutive new adult medical admissions to a tertiary referral hospital in Nairobi and perform autopsies on a sample of HIV-1-positive and HIV-1-negative patients who died in the hospital ward. Basic demographic data were collected on all patients admitted to two acute medical wards over an 11-month period. Final outcome and final clinical diagnoses were recorded at discharge or death. An autopsy examination was requested if the patient died in the ward. Autopsy examination was performed in 75 HIV-1-positive (40 men, 35 women) and 47 HIV-1-negative (28 men, 19 women) adults who died in the hospital. This represented 48.4% of all HIV-1-positive deaths and 33.3% of all HIV-1-negative deaths. Tuberculosis (TB) and bacterial and interstitial bronchopneumonia accounted for 96% of the major pathology in patients found to be HIV-1-positive at autopsy. TB was present in half the HIV-1-positive autopsy patients and was disseminated in over 80% of cases. Meningeal involvement was present in 26% of those with disseminated TB. By contrast, TB was much less common in the HIV-1-negative patients at autopsy in whom bacterial bronchopneumonia and malignancies were the most common pathologies. The type pathology found in the HIV-1-positive autopsy patients was not different than that found in other areas in Africa so far studied."
5383,0.003,3.0,"To characterize WHO-defined transmitted HIV drug resistance mutation (TDRM) data from recently HIV-infected African volunteers, we sequenced HIV (pol) and evaluated for TDRM the earliest available specimens from ARV-naive volunteers diagnosed within 1 year of their estimated date of infection at eight research centers in sub-Saharan Africa. TDRMs were detected in 19/408 (5%) volunteers. The prevalence of TDRMs varied by research center, from 5/26 (19%) in Entebbe, 6/78 (8%) in Kigali, 2/49 (4%) in Kilifi, to 3/106 (3%) in Lusaka. One of five volunteers from Cape Town (20%) had TDRMs. Despite small numbers, our data suggest an increase in DRMs by year of infection in Zambia (p = 0.004). The prevalence observed in Entebbe was high across the entire study. ARV history data from 12 (63%) HIV-infected sexual partners were available; 3 reported ARV use prior to transmission. Among four partners with sequence data available, transmission linkage was confirmed and two had the same TDRMs as the newly infected volunteer (both K103N). As ARV therapy continues to increase in availability throughout Africa, monitoring incident virus strains for the presence of TDRMs should be a priority. Early HIV infection cohorts provide an excellent and important platform to monitor the development of TDRMs to inform treatment guidelines, drug choices, and strategies for secondary prevention of TDRM transmission."
582,0.003,3.0,"The current study investigated the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection on the rate of change of antiretroviral drugs after the initiation of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). The data on 1425 HIV-positive patients with recorded serology for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were retrospectively analysed. The estimated rate of treatment change was slightly higher in the HBsAg-positive group (0.57 per year) compared with the HBsAg-negative group (0.50 per year). Although this difference was insignificant in multivariable modelling, the confidence intervals of the estimates barely included unity. Antiretroviral drug family, calendar period, prior exposure to antiretrovirals and the diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were independently associated with the number of drug alterations. A slight impact of co-infection on the frequency of treatment change after the beginning of HAART cannot be excluded. However, the paucity of studies on this issue necessitates the conduct of further research."

6259,0.003,3.0,"A prognostic scoring tool (PST) was created to aid prediction of outcome from HIV-associated Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) using data obtained from 577 episodes of PCP among 540 patients presenting to a specialist HIV treatment centre in London, UK. It used risk factors identifiable at/soon after hospitalization, previously identified as being associated with mortality: repeat episode of PCP, patient's age, haemoglobin (Hb) and oxygen partial pressure (PaO(2)) on admission, presence of medical co-morbidity (Comorb) and of pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma (PKS). The derived PST was 25.5+(age in years/10) + 2 (if a repeat episode of PCP) + 3 (if Comorb present) + 4 (if PKS detected) - PaO(2) (kPa) - Hb (g/dL), and produced scores that ranged between 0 and 19. Patients were divided into five groups according to their prognostic score: 0-3.9 = group 1 (0% mortality), 4-7.9 = group 2 (3% mortality), 8-10.9 = group 3 (9% mortality), 11-14.9 = group 4 (29% mortality) and ≥ 15 = group 5 (52% mortality). This PST facilitates rapid identification of patients early in their hospitalization who have mild or severe HIV-associated PCP and who are at high and low risk of in-hospital death from PCP. The PST may aid assessment of severity of illness and in directing treatment strategies, but requires validation in patient cohorts from other health-care institutions."
1527,0.003,3.0,"The latent HIV reservoir is a major impediment to curing HIV infection. The contribution of CD4(+) T cell activation status to the establishment and maintenance of the latent reservoir was investigated by enumerating viral DNA components in a cohort of 12 individuals commencing antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing raltegravir, an integrase inhibitor. Prior to ART, the levels of total HIV DNA were similar across HLA-DR(+) and HLA-DR(-) (HLA-DR(±)) CD38(±) memory CD4(+) T cell phenotypes; episomal two-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) HIV DNA levels were higher in resting (HLA-DR(-) CD38(-)) cells, and this phenotype exhibited a significantly higher ratio of 2-LTR to integrated HIV DNA (P = 0.002). After 1 year of ART, there were no significant differences across each of the memory phenotypes of any HIV DNA component. The decay dynamics of integrated HIV DNA were slow within each subset, and integrated HIV DNA in the resting HLA-DR(-) CD38(-) subset per mm(3) of peripheral blood exhibited no significant decay (half-life of 25 years). Episomal 2-LTR HIV DNA decayed relative to integrated HIV DNA in resting cells with a half-life of 134 days. Surprisingly, from week 12 on, the decay rates of both total and episomal HIV DNA were lower in activated CD38(+) cells. By weeks 24 and 52, HIV RNA levels in plasma were most significantly correlated with the numbers of resting cells containing integrated HIV DNA. On the other hand, total HIV DNA levels in all subsets were significantly correlated with the numbers of HLA-DR(+) CD38(-) cells containing integrated HIV DNA. These results provide insights into the interrelatedness of cell activation and reservoir maintenance, with implications for the design of therapeutic strategies targeting HIV persistence."
3792,0.003,3.0,"To define the extent of sequence conservation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) in vivo, the first 320 amino acids of RT obtained from 2,236 plasma-derived samples from a well-defined cohort of 1,704 HIV-1-infected individuals (457 drug naïve and 1,247 drug treated) were analyzed and examined in structural terms. In naïve patients, 233 out of these 320 residues (73%) were conserved (<1% variability). The majority of invariant amino acids clustered into defined regions comprising between 5 and 29 consecutive residues. Of the nine longest invariant regions identified, some contained residues and domains critical for enzyme stability and function. In patients treated with RT inhibitors, despite profound drug pressure and the appearance of mutations primarily associated with resistance, 202 amino acids (63%) remained highly conserved and appeared mostly distributed in regions of variable length. This finding suggests that participation of consecutive residues in structural domains is strictly required for cooperative functions and sustainability of HIV-1 RT activity. Besides confirming the conservation of amino acids that are already known to be important for catalytic activity, stability of the heterodimer interface, and/or primer/template binding, the other 62 new invariable residues are now identified and mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. This new knowledge could be of help in the structure-based design of novel resistance-evading drugs."

Reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes of plasma virions were sequenced from 100 individuals. The majority of the patients were recently diagnosed. Codons 20-255 of the RT and 1-96 of the protease gene were examined for major and minor mutations associated with antiretroviral resistance reported by the International AIDS Society- USA (IAS-USA) Drug Resistance Mutations Group. The prevalence of patients with at least one major mutation conferring drug resistance was 1%, with only one patient having a Y181C amino acid substitution in the RT gene that confers high-level resistance to nevirapine and delavirdine. Minor mutations were detected in high prevalence in the protease gene. Amino acid substitutions I13V, E35D, and M36I were associated with CRF01_AE while L63P, V77I, and I93L were associated with subtype B. Baseline prevalence of major mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs was low among antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 patients, suggesting that routine drug resistance testing may be unnecessary for all individuals newly diagnosed with HIV or all patients beginning antiretroviral therapy."
1859,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Nef is a membrane-associated protein decreasing surface expression of CD4, CD28, and major histocompatibility complex class I on infected cells. We report that Nef strongly down-modulates surface expression of the beta-chain of the CD8alphabeta receptor by accelerated endocytosis, while CD8 alpha-chain expression is less affected. By mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic tail of the CD8 beta-chain, an FMK amino acid motif was shown to be critical for Nef-induced endocytosis. Although independent of CD4, endocytosis of the CD8 beta-chain was abrogated by the same mutations in Nef that affect CD4 down-regulation, suggesting common molecular interactions. The ability to down-regulate the human CD8 beta-chain was conserved in HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239 Nef and required an intact AP-2 complex. The Nef-mediated internalization of receptors, such as CD4, major histocompatibility complex class I, CD28, and CD8alphabeta, may contribute to the subversion of the host immune system and progression towards AIDS."

The urine samples were screened for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae in HIV positive men without urethritis symptoms was significantly higher than that in HIV negative men with urethritis symptoms (p<0.05). HIV positive individuals should be considered as a high-risk group in respect to the other sexually transmitted diseases, thus necessitating screening for N. gonorrhoeae in order to break the infectious chain in these patients."
3234,0.003,3.0,"Although several immunologic and virologic markers measured in peripheral blood are useful for predicting accelerated progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, their validity for evaluating the response to antiretroviral therapy and their ability to accurately reflect changes in lymphoid organs remain unclear. In the present study, changes in certain virologic markers have been analyzed in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue during antiretroviral therapy. Sixteen HIV-infected individuals who were receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine for > or = 6 months were randomly assigned either to continue on zidovudine alone or to add didanosine for 8 weeks. Lymph node biopsies were performed at baseline and after 8 weeks. Viral burden (i.e., HIV DNA copies per 10(6) mononuclear cells) and virus replication in mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood and lymph node and plasma viremia were determined by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. Virologic and immunologic markers remained unchanged in peripheral blood and lymph node of patients who continued on zidovudine alone. In contrast, a decrease in virus replication in lymph nodes was observed in four of six patients who added didanosine to their regimen, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma viremia. These results indicate that decreases in plasma viremia detected during antiretroviral therapy reflect downregulation of virus replication in lymphoid tissue."

HCV transmission patterns have changed among the HIV co-infected population during the last decade, with acute HCV infection emerging worldwide. HIV infection accelerates the progression of HCV-related liver diseases and consequently cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the current standard treatment of HCV infection with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin results in only a limited viral response. Furthermore, cumbersome pill regimens, antiretroviral related hepatotoxicity, and drug interactions of HCV and HIV regimens complicate therapy strategies. Fortunately, in the near future, new direct-acting anti-HCV agents will widen therapeutic options for HCV/HIV co-infection. Liver transplantation is also gradually accepted as a therapeutic option for end stage liver disease of HCV/HIV co-infected patients. "

2909,0.003,3.0,"Cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis-associated complications, is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients in the post-antiretroviral therapy era. HIV alone accelerates atherosclerosis. Antiretroviral therapy; HIV-associated comorbidities, such as dyslipidemia, drug abuse, and opportunistic infections; and lifestyle are risk factors for HIV-associated atherosclerosis. However, our current understanding of HIV-associated atherogenesis is very limited and has largely been obtained from clinical observation. There is a pressing need to experimentally unravel the missing link between HIV and atherosclerosis. Understanding these mechanisms will help to better develop and design novel therapeutic interventions for the treatment of HIV-associated cardiovascular disease. HIV mainly infects T cells and macrophages resulting in the induction of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, the formation of the inflammasome, and the dysregulation of autophagy. These mechanisms may contribute to HIV-associated atherogenesis. In this review, we will summarize our current understanding and propose potential mechanisms of HIV-associated atherosclerosis."
9861,0.003,3.0,"The use of antiretroviral (ARV) medications has been linked to the emergence of severe adverse effects, including mitochondrial toxicity. The liver also appears to be among the affected organs. Nevertheless, different studies suggest that these patients' mitochondrial alterations could be associated to other etiological factors. The goal of this study was to analyze hepatic mitochondria ultrastructural changes in HIV-infected patients under investigation for hepatopathy. Semiquantitative analysis of mitochondria was performed in liver biopsies from 10 patients divided into 2 groups: Group 1 consisted of 5 patients who had never used ARV medications; group 2 consisted of 5 patients who reported previous use of either zidovudine or didanosine. Significant mitochondrial alterations were found in both groups. The summation of the mitochondrial alterations was higher in group 1 (P < .05) when compared with those who had previously used ARV medications. Therefore, the authors conclude that severe mitochondrial alterations occur in HIV-infected patients who have never been submitted to antiretroviral therapy."
5531,0.003,3.0,"Effective antiretroviral therapy initially resulted in large decreases in hospitalization rates of HIV-infected patients. The goal of this study was to determine whether these gains were being maintained in 2001. A cross-sectional study of hospital admission characteristics during four time periods was performed. All patients receiving care at the HIV clinics of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (NYPH) in New York City were included. In 1995, 883 outpatients were receiving care for HIV infection at NYPH; this increased to 1990 outpatients by 2001. Demographic and laboratory information was obtained for these outpatients, and diagnoses were recorded for all patients requiring hospitalization on at NYPH during the time periods January 1 through June 30, in 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001. The incidence of hospital admission declined in all four time periods: 1995 (95 per 100 patient-years [pt-yr]), 1997 (48 per 100 pt-yr), 1999 (38 per 100 pt-yr, p < 0.05), and 2001 (25 per 100 pt-yr). The incidence of bacterial pneumonia and opportunistic infections (OIs) decreased in all four time periods. The median hospitalization were CD4(+) cell count for outpatients increased from 231 (1995) to 364 (2001). Important predictors of hospitalization were CD4(+) < 200, and IVDU as an HIV risk factor. Since 1995 and the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, continuing increases in CD4(+) cell counts of outpatients has been reflected in persistent declines in hospitalization rates. Large decreases in OIs and pneumonia have been minimally offset by stable rates of hospital admissions for diagnoses such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and cellulitis."
8788,0.003,3.0,"Hepatic iron overload has been described in chronic hepatitis C as a cofactor affecting fibrosis progression. Data in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection are scarce. We investigated hepatic iron deposits and serum iron indices in 205 consecutive patients with hepatitis B and compensated liver disease. Mean age of the patients was 42.4 ± 12.4 years and 72.5% were males. Coinfection with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) was present in 8.8%. At least one of the serum iron indices was elevated in 41.5% of cases. Hepatic iron deposits were detected in 35.1% of patients, most of them being minimal (grade I) (59.7%) or mild (grade II) (27.8%). Variables significantly associated with hepatic iron deposits were male gender (P = 0.001), serum ferritin (P = 0.008), γGT (P = 0.05) and alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.05) levels. By multivariate analysis hepatic iron deposits correlated with serum ferritin [odds ratio (OR) 1.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.4, P = 0.002]. Presence of mild-moderate (grades II and III) hepatic iron deposits could be excluded with high negative predictive value (90%) when serum ferritin was within normal values. A significant correlation between coinfection with HDV and hepatic iron deposits was also found (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.52-11.82, P = 0.003). When compared to monoinfected cases, HDV positive patients had more elevated γGT (P = 0.03), more advanced fibrosis and more severe iron deposits (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, in well-compensated chronic hepatitis B infection, hepatic iron deposits and elevation of serum iron indices are common, especially in male gender and in patients coinfected with HDV. As HBV/HDV liver disease is generally more rapidly progressive than that caused by HBV monoinfection, we speculate that iron overload may be one of the factors contributing to the severity of liver disease."
1443,0.003,3.0,"A patient with hematologic malignancy and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection received chemotherapy containing a glucocorticoid. The patient developed severe hepatitis after chemotherapy and, despite achieving complete remission of the malignancy, died of hepatic failure. We carried out a retrospective study of changes in the serological markers of HBV in this patient. Both serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) were negative on admission. During the course of chemotherapy, HBsAg gradually became positive, but no liver dysfunction was apparent until after completion of the chemotherapy. The patient showed no initial evidence of being a latent HBV carrier. Therefore, we believe that screening for HBsAg is insufficient for detecting latent HBV carriers, and that investigation for hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) is essential."
7433,0.003,3.0,"The role of exposure to antiretrovirals (ARV) and serum matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) on liver fibrosis (LF) progression in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) mono or HIV- hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection is unclear. Thus, 213 Caucasian adult HIV-infected patients were studied, 111 of whom had HCV-coinfection and 68 were HCV-monoinfected. Patients with ethanol consumption >50 g/day, hepatitis B coinfection, non-infective liver diseases or HAART adherence <75% were excluded. LF was assessed by transient elastometry (TE, Fibroscan). Serum levels of MMPs (MMP -1,-2,-3,-8,-9,-10 and -13) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP-1,-2 and -4) were measured by ELISA microarrays. Associations with LF were statistically analysed. Protease inhibitors, usually administered to patients with advanced LF were excluded from the analysis. Increased LF was significantly associated with d4T (P = 0.006) and didanosine (ddI) use (P = 0.007), months on d4T (P = 0.001) and on ARV (P = 0.025), duration of HIV (P < 0.0001) and HCV infections (P < 0.0001), higher HIV (P = 0.03) and HCV loads (P < 0.0001), presence of lipodystrophy (P = 0.02), male gender (P = 0.02), older age (P = 0.04), low nadir (P = 0.02) and current CD4(+) T-cells (P < 0.0001), low gain of CD4(+) T-cells after HAART (P = 0.01) and higher MMP-2 (P = 0.02) and TIMP-2 serum levels (P = 0.02). By logistic regression the only variables significantly associated with increased LF were: use of ddI (OR 8.77, 95% CI: 2.36-32.26; P = 0.005), male gender (OR 7.75, 95% CI: 2.33-25.64, P = 0.0008), HCV viral load (in log) (OR 3.53, 95% CI: 2.16-5.77; P < 0.0001) and age (in years) (OR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09-1.34, P = 0.0003). We conclude that only higher HCV viral load, older age, male gender, and use of ddI associated independently with increased LF in our study."
7362,0.003,3.0,"Providers are central to effective implementation of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Primary care providers (PCP) and infectious disease physicians (ID) in the US Air Force (USAF) participated in a cross-sectional survey regarding knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward HIV PrEP. Characteristics associated with PrEP knowledge were assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses.Among 403 (40% of 1015 providers) participants, 9% (PCP 383, ID 20) ever prescribed PrEP. In univariate analysis, years in practice, number of HIV-infected patients treated in the past 12 months, past prescription of antiretrovirals for HIV prevention, frequency of prescribing PrEP in the past 12 months, and ever being questioned by a patient about PrEP were associated with PrEP knowledge (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, providers who had ever prescribed antiretrovirals to prevent HIV (AOR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.27-4.42) had greater odds of high PrEP knowledge. Despite concerns about medication side effects (overall 67%: PCP 68%, ID 85%) and prescribing PrEP without clear evidence (overall 60%: PCP 65%, ID 62%), 64% (PCP 65%, ID 85%) of participants indicated PrEP should be offered in the Military Health System and 68% (PCP 70%, ID 100%) disagreed with the statement that their patient population was not at risk for HIV infection.Successful PrEP implementation in the USAF will require continued education and training of primary care providers to improve knowledge and mitigate concerns about PrEP.

7094,0.003,3.0,"Our study assessed the influence of HIV-related stigma on treatment adherence among people living with HIV in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and whether social support had a moderating effect on this relationship. We recruited 128 patients living with HIV from Sansai Hospital, a community hospital in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and collected data through structured interviews. All forms of HIV-related stigma considered in this study (personalized experience, disclosure, negative self-image, and public attitudes) were negatively correlated with adherence to anti-retroviral regimens. Multiple linear regression indicated that total HIV-related stigma was more predictive of treatment adherence than any individual stigma type, after adjusting for socio-demographic and health characteristics. Tests of interaction showed that social support did not appear to moderate the association between HIV stigma and treatment adherence. Our findings suggest that community and government efforts to improve public perceptions about people living with HIV might promote treatment adherence behaviors among HIV-positive patients. "
6686,0.003,3.0,"A prospective design was used to collect data from 132 HIV-positive individuals presenting for mental health care at an inner-city HIV-related mental health clinic located in a large metropolitan area of the Southeastern USA. Data were analyzed to assess associations between study variables and whether participants returned for care following an initial mental health assessment. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the extent to which the addition of measures of health beliefs and HIV-related stigma would enhance the predictive capacity of a dropout model that included demographics and health status measures. As health beliefs and HIV-related stigma were added to the model, the predictive capacity increased significantly (R(2)=0.29 to R(2)=0.63, p<0.05). Those who did not return for care had higher levels of perceived barriers to mental health care, higher levels of HIV-related stigma, were more likely to be of non-white ethnicity and had lower T-cell counts. These findings indicate that mental health providers may need to ensure care systems are responsive to the social and cultural characteristics of clients, and the HIV epidemic itself, in order to effectively engage clients into care."
380,0.003,3.0,"The objective of the study was to investigate whether closer adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern is associated with metabolic aspects of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-induced metabolic syndrome (fat redistribution [FR], insulin resistance, dyslipidemia) in HIV-positive patients. This was a cross-sectional study. Two hundred twenty-seven HIV-infected patients were evaluated during a single outpatient visit to the General Clinical Research Center of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Usual dietary intake and physical activity habits were evaluated; the Mediterranean Diet Score (MedDietScore) was calculated. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, computed tomographic findings, anthropometrics, and data from the study interviews and questionnaires were used for the assessment of body composition using specific criteria. A complete metabolic profile was available for all subjects. In the entire study sample, a weak inverse association was found between insulin resistance, estimated using the homeostasis model assessment, and MedDietScore (standardized beta = -0.15, P = .03). Interaction models revealed that this was largely driven by an inverse association in patients with FR (standardized beta = -0.13, P = .02). Moreover, MedDietScore was positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (standardized beta = 0.15, P = .01) and marginally negatively associated with circulating triglyceride levels (standardized beta = -0.16, P = .13) in this group of patients. Adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern was favorably related to cardiovascular risk factors in HIV-positive patients with FR. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm our data in different populations and to explore the underlying mechanisms."
9599,0.003,3.0,"Viral hepatitis which follows transfusions (post-transfusion hepatitis) may be due to those transfusions, i.e., transfusion-transmitted hepatitis (TTH), or may be incident to the reason for the transfusion and, thus, may be transfusion-associated, but not transfusion-transmitted. The current risks of TTH, today, are extremely small, but are still due, primarily, to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the latter, formerly being known as ""non-A, non-B hepatitis."" The residual, now, of TTH which is non-A, non-B, and non-C is extremely small and may be due to a variety of agents. Using volunteer (unpaid), repeat, blood donors, who are carefully screened for hepatitis risk factors and then tested for evidence of HBV infection, the risk of HBV being transmitted by a transfusion today is in the order of 1 per 63,000 units of blood. For transfusion-transmitted HCV, with the same repeat, volunteer (unpaid) donors, careful screening and a sensitive assay for anti-HCV, the risk is in the order of 1 in 125,000 units. These risks of HBV and HCV due to transfusions are so small that other means of acquiring these viruses should be sought when patients develop hepatitis following blood transfusions. However, efforts to further reduce the current risks of HBV and HCV transmission by transfusions should continue; these include restricting transfusions to those which are necessary or appropriate, utilizing alternatives to transfusion, employing novel assays to detect viral nucleic acids, and, finally, implementing various microbial inactivation techniques on blood, blood components and plasma derivatives."
9160,0.003,3.0,"To detect the beliefs concerning the risk levels related to several sexual practices/habits and the HIV infection among undergraduate students and to compare their opinion with the AIDS experts were the objectives of this study. A 25-item questionnaire (Likert Probability Scale) about sexual practices/habits were answered by undergraduate students enrolled in the courses of nursing, medical school, pharmacy-biochemistry, psychology. Based on Factorial analysis and by using the Varimax Rotation System, 25 patients were distributed in 7 factors, and 5 patients were excluded. From the 20 patients, 5 were reunited in 2 factors and studied in this paper. Factor X reunited the patients 1 (vaginal intercourse with condom) and 2 (anal sex with condom). In factor Y the patients included were: 3 (heterosexual intercourse), 4 (vaginal intercourse without condom) and 5 (anal intercourse without condom). In 80% of the 5 patients, it was observed that the students have knowledge similar to the experts""s evidences But, continuing education is necessary to these people, as human beings and as future health care givers to the HIV infected/AIDS patients."
1450,0.003,3.0,"Several hematological abnormalities associated with HIV have been documented, but the mechanisms responsible for the cytopenias in AIDS patients are complex and not always completely understood. Thrombocytopenia, which occurs in about 40% of patients with HIV infection, may be caused by increased peripheral platelet destruction, a defect in platelet production due to the impaired formation of platelets by HIV-infected magakaryocytes, or a combination of these. The aim of this study was to compare the morphology of the platelet aggregates in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) clots prepared from HIV patients with those of controls without HIV. These platelet aggregates were studied using the scanning electron microscope to determine the effect of the virus on platelet ultrastructure. The results showed that although the platelets do aggregate, the morphology was changed with membrane blebbing as well as torn cellular membranes. Membrane blebbing is typically associated with apoptosis. It is concluded that the altered morphology of platelet aggregates in HIV patients may be related to thrombocytopenia as a result of peripheral platelet destruction."

7848,0.003,3.0,"This demonstration study tested the impact of a 5-month clinic-wide social marketing campaign at improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). The intervention included a video, posters, pens, mugs, and lapel buttons with the campaign slogan ""Live the Solution: Take Your Pills Every Day."" Participants self-reported adherence over a 4-week interval, the primary outcome, with a visual analogue scale. Pre- and post-intervention surveys were completed by 141 participants. Adherence did not change over time (absolute mean change -2.02 %, paired t test P = 0.39). Among the 39.7 % of participants who correctly identified the campaign slogan on the post-intervention survey, adherence increased by 3.3 %, while it decreased in the other participants by 5.5 % (paired t test P = 0.07). The well-received campaign did not increase short-term adherence to ART, but adherence tended to increase in participants who were more engaged with the intervention. Future interventions should engage patients more completely and have a more potent effect on adherence."
3140,0.003,3.0,"The increasing demand for fertility advice among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive women under our care led us to review the incidence of infertility and the ethical problems associated with its management. All HIV-positive women who attended the HIV outpatients clinic from October 1990 to the end of January 1996 were studied. The main outcome measures were: the number of women undergoing infertility investigations before and after HIV diagnosis, their demographic and social details, and the outcome of these investigations. Most of the 183 women studied were in their reproductive years (mean age 32.7 +/- 6.7 years). Nine women had undergone infertility investigations, and/or treatment before HIV diagnosis, three of whom were diagnosed with HIV during routine testing prior to IVF treatment. Six declined further infertility treatment after discovering their HIV status. Eight women have undergone infertility investigations after HIV diagnosis but none have achieved pregnancy to date. Management decisions may have been hampered by ethical uncertainties in several cases. In conclusion therefore, as requests for infertility treatment from HIV-infected women occur and may become more common as the prevalence of HIV infection in women continues to rise, the ethical issues associated with the management of this problem demand urgent attention so that clear guidelines are available to aid treatment decisions."

2656,0.003,3.0,"Postmortem cesarean sections are rare events, but modern technology is forcing society to explore the definition of viability and the legal rights of both mother and fetus that ultimately will affect the frequency and use of this rare operation. Since the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevalence rate and the number of critically ill obstetrical patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) continues to rise, it is reasonable to assume more patients and physicians may be confronted by issues concerning fetal and maternal rights and other considerations in perimortem delivery. A 33-year-old woman, at 27 weeks' gestation, with fulminant AIDS was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in respiratory distress. As her condition deteriorated the complex problem of caring for both mother and fetus emerged. A patient advisory panel explored the issues with the patient, her family, and her health care team. Eventually a peri/postmortem cesarean section was performed on the mother when she suffered an acute fatal cardiorespiratory arrest. With the prevalence of AIDS increasing and with most women not being tested prior to pregnancy, many obstetricians will be confronted with new medical and legal challenges. Establishing comprehensive medical management for the critically ill obstetrical patient and understanding the legal rights of both patients (mother and fetus) will help avoid conflicts and potentially improve survival."
2301,0.003,3.0,"Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can be successfully treated using nucleos(t)ide analogs (NA), but drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants frequently arise, leading to treatment failure and progression to liver disease. There has been much research into the mechanisms of resistance to NA and selection of these mutants. Five NA have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of CHB; it is unlikely that any more NA will be developed in the near future, so it is important to better understand mechanisms of cross-resistance (when a mutation that mediates resistance to one NA also confers resistance to another) and design more effective therapeutic strategies for these 5 agents. The genes that encode the polymerase and envelope proteins of HBV overlap, so resistance mutations in polymerase usually affect the hepatitis B surface antigen; these alterations affect infectivity, vaccine efficacy, pathogenesis of liver disease, and transmission throughout the population. Associations between HBV genotype and resistance phenotype have allowed cross-resistance profiles to be determined for many commonly detected mutants, so genotyping assays can be used to adapt therapy. Patients that experience virologic breakthrough or partial response to their primary therapy can often be successfully treated with a second NA, if this drug is given at early stages of these events. However, best strategies for preventing NA resistance include first-line use of the most potent antivirals with a high barrier to resistance. It is important to continue basic research into HBV replication and pathogenic mechanisms to identify new therapeutic targets, develop novel antiviral agents, design combination therapies that prevent drug resistance, and decrease the incidence of complications of CHB."
6921,0.003,3.0,"Because pancreatitis has been reported frequently in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection, we sought to determine the incidence of pancreatitis in children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome by reviewing all records of children with AIDS, their serum amylase and lipase levels, and the factors associated with pancreatitis through a case-control analysis. During a 6-year period pancreatitis developed in 9 (17%) of 53 pediatric patients with AIDS. Six children had vertical transmission of infection and three patients had acquired HIV infection through contaminated blood products. Pancreatitis developed at a median age of 5.2 years (range 1.2 to 20 years). All patients had vomiting and abdominal pain. When the patients were first seen, lipase values were elevated more than amylase values (p = 0.028). Amylase and lipase levels declined at comparable rates. In the case-control analysis, pentamidine isethionate was significantly associated with pancreatitis (p = 0.02); the risk was greater in patients who received pentamidine isethionate and had absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/mm3 (p = 0.001). Infections associated with the onset of pancreatitis included cytomegalovirus (4), Cryptosporidium (1), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (3), and Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (1). Coinfection with cytomegalovirus was associated with a protracted course in four children. Ultrasonographic examination demonstrated biliary ductal dilatation 6 months after the onset of pancreatitis in one child. Seven children have died at a mean of 8 months after the initial onset of pancreatitis; the one living child has survived 5 months from the onset of pancreatitis. We conclude that pancreatitis is common in pediatric patients with AIDS and may be related to pentamidine isethionate exposure, especially when absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts are less than 100 cells/mm3. Serum amylase levels do not always accurately predict the onset of pancreatitis; serum lipase levels should be measured in children with symptoms. The onset of pancreatitis in an HIV-infected child is a poor prognostic indicator."
6602,0.003,3.0,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in many developing and developed nations, leading to talk of the ""twin epidemics."" The latest projections from the International Diabetes Federation suggest that 190 million people worldwide currently have type 2 diabetes. In addition, > or = 300 million people worldwide have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). These statistics represent an epidemic of major proportions--possibly the largest epidemic in human history--in terms of glucose intolerance and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk because individuals with IGT are at substantially higher risk for diabetes and CVD than are members of the general population. Along with IGT, the metabolic syndrome comprises other major CVD risk factors, including insulin resistance, central obesity, and dyslipidemia; insulin resistance has been implicated as the single most common cause of the syndrome. Although the exact prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is unknown, the syndrome is widespread among adults in developed nations, becoming more prevalent with age. Epidemiologic data suggest that in patients with schizophrenia or affective disorders, both diabetes and obesity are 1.5 to 2.0 times more prevalent than in the general population. Furthermore, because adverse effects of certain therapies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and psychiatric disorders increase the risk for developing diabetes, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome, such therapies should be carefully chosen, particularly considering CVD risk. Appropriate therapy may be determined via screening of patients for levels of fasting blood glucose and lipids, as well as other CVD risk factors, before initiating use of second-generation antipsychotic agents or highly active antiretroviral therapy."
3352,0.003,3.0,"Psychosocial conditions such as depression, intimate partner violence (IPV), and history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) have been associated with poor HIV-related outcomes. In India, which has the third largest HIV epidemic in the world, little is understood about the impact of psychosocial conditions on people living with HIV (PLHIV). We aimed to understand the prevalence and correlates of psychosocial conditions among PLHIV entering into HIV care at the Y.R. Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education in Chennai, India. Thirteen questions were added to the standard voluntary counseling and testing questionnaire, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (a depression scale) and questions assessing for CSA and IPV. We fitted logistic regression models, stratified by gender, with psychosocial condition as the outcome of interest and substance use variables and socio-demographic variables as the correlates of interest. Three hundred and eighty-three persons were enrolled into the study; of these, 253 (66%) tested positive for HIV, including 149 men and 104 women, and were included in the models. More than one-quarter (28%) of the men and 19% of the women reported at least one psychosocial condition (probable depression, CSA, or IPV). In adjusted analysis, current alcohol use was associated with greater than two times higher odds of a psychosocial condition (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.24, 95% CI, 1.04-4.85) among men. In conclusion, we estimated the prevalence of probable depression, CSA, and IPV among PLHIV presenting for HIV care in southern India and found that, among male PLHIV, alcohol use was associated with a markedly higher odds of reporting a psychosocial condition. Further study is needed to characterize alcohol use among male PLHIV and the possible deleterious impact of psychosocial conditions and alcohol use on HIV-related outcomes in India."
7069,0.003,3.0,"Late presentation remains a major concern despite the dramatically improved prognosis realized by ART. We define a first presentation for HIV care during the course of HIV infection as 'late' if an AIDS-defining opportunistic disease is apparent, or if CD4+ T-cells are <200/microl. In the Western world, approximately 10 and 30% of HIV-infected individuals still present with CD4+ T-cells <50 and <200/microl, respectively; estimates are substantially higher for developing countries. Diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic diseases and intense supportive in-hospital care take precedence over ART. Benefits of starting ART without delay, that is, when opportunistic diseases are still active, include faster resolution of opportunistic diseases and a decreased risk of recurrence. The downside of starting ART without delay could include toxicity, drug interactions and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Among asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic individuals presenting late, where ART and primary prophylaxis are initiated, approximately 10-20% will become symptomatic from drug toxicity or undiagnosed opportunistic complications, including IRIS, which require appropriate therapies. In this review we describe late presentation to HIV care, the scale of the problem, the evaluation of a late-presenting patient and challenges associated with initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the setting of acute opportunistic infections and other comorbidities."
6221,0.003,3.0,The ultrasensitive COBAS AMPLICOR HIV-1 Monitor test was complemented with automated RNA purification on the MagNA Pure LC instrument. This enabled entirely automated ultrasensitive assessment of viral loads in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals. The detection limit of the fully automated assay and the viral load measurements in 80 clinical samples were found to be in good agreement with those of the conventional ultrasensitive COBAS AMPLICOR HIV-1 Monitor test. The fully automated assay showed markedly reduced hands-on time and was found to be suitable for the routine assessment of HIV-1 viral loads in a clinical diagnostic laboratory.
5080,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and treatment updates include screening recommendations, fourth-generation testing, preexposure prophylaxis, and a paradigm shift; treatment is prevention. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends routine HIV screening in persons 15 to 65 years of age, regardless of risk. Fourth-generation testing is replacing the Western blot and can identify those with acute HIV infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test; however, there are concerns about reduced sensitivity, possible misinterpretation of results, potential for less effective counseling, and possible cost barriers. Preexposure prophylaxis (effective in select high-risk adult populations) is the combination of safer sex practices and continuous primary care prevention services, plus combination antiretroviral therapy. Concerns for preexposure prophylaxis include the necessity of strict medication adherence, limited use among high-risk populations, and community misconceptions of appropriate use. Evidence supports combination antiretroviral therapy as prevention for acute HIV infection, thus lowering community viral loads. Evidence has increased supporting combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment at any CD4 cell count. Resistance testing should guide therapy in all patients on entry into care. Within two weeks of diagnosis of most opportunistic infections, combination antiretroviral therapy should be started; patients with tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis require special considerations."
6413,0.003,3.0,"A methodology based on micellar liquid chromatography to monitor five antiretroviral drugs (lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zidovudine and efavirenz) was proposed. Antiretrovirals were studied in sets of three, corresponding to each highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regime, prescribed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-infected patients. Four aqueous micellar mobile phases buffered at pH 7 were optimized to separate these compounds, using sodium dodecyl sulfate as the tensioactive, and 1-propanol or 1-pentanol as the organic modifier. The composition of each mobile phase was optimized for each antiretroviral. The common separation conditions were: C18 apolar column (125 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size), UV detection set at 214 nm, and mobile phase running at 1 mL min(-1) without controlling the temperature. The finally suggested method was validated for five analysed antiretroviral drugs following the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines in terms of: linearity between 0.5 and 50 ppm (r(2) > 0.9995), sensitivity (LOD lower than 0.25 ppm), intra- and inter-day precision (<7.1 and <5.2%, respectively) and accuracy (recovery 88.5-105.3% and 93.5-101.3%, respectively), as well as robustness (<6.5%). The proposed method was used to monitor the level of antiretrovirals in the serum of AIDS patients. The suggested methodology was found to be useful in the routine analysis of antiretrovirals in serum samples."
1851,0.003,3.0,"There are very few data on the molecular biology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in dialysis patients. 101 patients undergoing dialysis treatment in 4 units in the Lombardy, northern Italy, were analyzed by RT-PCR for HCV viremia, by line probe assay technology for HCV genotyping and by a serological analysis for detecting type-specific antibodies. 61 of 101 (60%) patients showed detectable HCV RNA in serum; HCV genotype 2a was dominant (30/53 = 57%), followed by HCV genotype 1b (20/53 = 37%). There was no relationship between HCV genotyping and the clinical or demographic features of the patients. The antibody response toward the c33-c, c100-3, and 5-1-1 antigens was more frequent in HCV genotype 1b compared with genotype 2a (p = 0.046, p = 0.001 and p = 0.0001, respectively). The antibody levels to NS-3 and NS-4 HCV proteins were significantly higher in patients with-HCV genotype 1b in comparison with HCV 2a-infected individuals (p = 0.0001). There was a high level (82%) of agreement between HCV genotyping by RT-PCR and the assessment of type-specific antibodies by serological analysis; further, it was possible to detect type-specific antibodies in 6 of 22 (27%) patients in whom PCR amplification was unsuccessful. In conclusion, HCV subtype 2a was dominant in our population of HCV-infected dialysis patients, dialysis patients infected by different genotypes showed similar demographic and clinical characteristics, the antibody response toward the NS-3- and NS-4-related antigen of HCV was genotype dependent. There was a high level of agreement between HCV genotyping by RT-PCR and the detection of type-specific antibodies by serological analysis. As significant biological differences may exist among HCV strains, the assessment of HCV types may be very useful in the routine clinical activity of nephrologists in dialysis units."

7332,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) remain among the most common disorders in people infected with HIV, even in an era when potent antiretroviral therapy is widely deployed. This review discusses the clinical features of HANDs and the implications for more effective treatment. With the improved survival of individuals treated with antiretrovirals, comorbid conditions are increasingly salient, including particularly coinfection with hepatitis C and the effects of aging. This review attempts to answer why there appears to be a therapeutic gap between the salutary effects of antiretroviral regimens and normalization of neurological function. A second gap is found in the understanding of the pathophysiology of HANDs. This review addresses this and discusses the animal models that have helped to elucidate these mechanisms. Although triggered by productive HIV infection of brain macrophages, aberrant and sustained immune activation appears to play a major role in inducing HANDs, and may explain the often incomplete neurological response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Novel therapies aimed at persistent central nervous system inflammation will be needed to close this gap."
5212,0.003,3.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was revealed by a severe acute hepatitis with positive HBsAg in a patient. The positivity of IgM anti-HBc antibody, the rapid negativization of DNA-HBV, the early normalization of liver function tests and the exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis favored the diagnosis of recent HBV infection and were predictive of a rapidly favorable outcome. However, immunohistochemical study of a transjugular hepatic biopsy sample discovered HBsAg within the liver, with a characteristic topographic distribution of chronic HBV infection. The patient's evolution confirmed this diagnosis, because 20 months later he had chronic active hepatitis with persistent replicative activity of HBV. This case illustrates the heterogeneity of HBV infections, emphasizing the need of an accurate diagnosis and a careful follow up until the complete resolution of each case of acute hepatitis with positive HBsAg."
7641,0.003,3.0,"Viral load testing for human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) in resource-poor settings continues to be a challenge. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is being made available in developing countries, monitoring of viral load is not being done on a regular basis. The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of Cavidi version 3.0, which measures the plasma reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and compare its performance with molecular HIV viral load assays. In all, 125 HIV-1 and 13 HIV-2 positive samples were analyzed. The overall sensitivity of the assay was 86.8% and 94.1% for viral load >1000 copies/ml measured by Qiagen Artus HIV-1 RG RT PCR and Abbott RealTime HIV-1 PCR assays, respectively. Compared with the routine molecular viral load assays, Cavidi version 3.0 is inexpensive, user-friendly, the expenditure on infrastructure is minimal, and it can be used for monitoring of both HIV types.

3984,0.003,3.0,Serum from patients which tested positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) were analyzed for the presence of HCV RNA by nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and for anti-HCV antibodies by Recombinant Immunoblot Assay (RIBA II). Total RNA was extracted from whole blood by a new procedure and subjected to reverse transcription of HCV RNA employing primers to the conserved 5' non-coding region of the HCV genome. PCR performed on these samples uncovered several false positive ELISAs. Reciprocal confirmation between PCR and RIBA II results was observed. These results substantiate this variation of the HCV PCR assay as a reliable alternative for routine confirmation of HCV serological tests.
7211,0.003,3.0,"The general methods used for public health surveillance of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases and of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are no different from those used for other diseases and infections. However, the methods used must be adapted to the unique epidemiology, wide variation in prevalences, and the very long incubation period of HIV infections. In addition, the severity of AIDS and the extreme social and personal implications of identifying HIV-infected persons make surveillance of AIDS cases and HIV infections much more difficult and place paramount importance on issues such as anonymity and confidentiality. Information on the occurrence of AIDS cases is essential for planning and developing the clinical and laboratory facilities needed for treatment and care of patients with the disease. However, surveillance of AIDS cases is of limited value for assessing the magnitude and future trends of the pandemic because the number of such cases detected, diagnosed, and reported reflect HIV infections that were acquired many years previously. In addition, there are significant problems associated with the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of most AIDS case-reporting systems. Routine HIV surveillance systems are being developed worldwide. Such systems must be adapted to the prevailing epidemiological situation; and the sampling methods used in populations where the prevalence of infection is very low must necessarily differ from those where it is moderate to high. Large-scale population serosurveys are very costly, and the results from such surveys may also be of limited accuracy because of serious problems of selection and participation bias. Furthermore, they may become outdated rapidly in areas where a high incidence of HIV infection occurs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7266,0.003,3.0,"The main objectives of this study were to define the occurrence and levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in asymptomatic HBV carriers, cirrhosis patients and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases from The Gambia, and to evaluate the risk for cirrhosis or HCC associated with HBV viremia. We used sensitive real-time quantitative PCR assays to measure HBV DNA in samples from a case-control study consisting of 60 asymptomatic HBV carriers, 53 cirrhotic patients and 129 HCC cases. Logistic regression was used to estimate the risks of cirrhosis and HCC associated with HBV-DNA levels and HBV e antigenemia (HBeAg) detection (a surrogate marker for viral replication). Detectable HBV viremia and HBeAg positivity were both significantly associated with cirrhosis (increasing risk by fourfold and 11-fold respectively) and with HCC (increasing risk by sixfold and threefold respectively). HBV-DNA levels were significantly higher in both HCC cases and cirrhotic patients compared to asymptomatic carriers (P < 0.01 for both). High-level HBV DNA (>10,000 copies/mL) was strongly associated with both HCC and cirrhosis (17- and 39-fold increased risk). Lower level HBV viremia (200-10,000 copies/mL) conferred a significant risk of HCC, although the association with cirrhosis was not significant. In conclusion, we find that high HBV-DNA levels are strongly associated with the serious sequelae of HBV infection, independent of HBeAg status. While risk for cirrhosis and for HCC notably increases at HBV-DNA levels >or=10,000 copies/mL, low-level viremia was also associated with significant risk for HCC."
7821,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence and de novo HBV infection are frequent events in liver transplantation recipients. Treatment with lamivudine is initially efficient in both infections but the incidence of lamivudine-resistant HBV emergence increases over time. Adefovir appears to be promising in post-liver transplantation patients with recurrent HBV infection and lamivudine-resistant HBV. This study analyzed adefovir treatment in 42 post-liver transplantation patients who developed recurrent HBV or de novo HBV infection with lamivudine-resistant HBV (54.8% HCV-coinfected). Patients received 10 mg of oral adefovir once daily for a mean period of time of 21.5 months (range from 12 to 31 months). In 62.9% of patients, ALT levels decreased significantly. Serum HBV-DNA was undetectable in 64% of the cases. Twenty percent of patients lost HBeAg marker and 13.3% of them developed anti-HBe. In 9.5% of recipients, HBsAg became negative. There was no significant change in serum creatinine levels. In only one patient was worsening of the renal function detected, making dose adjustment necessary. No other side effects were reported. Our results confirm the efficacy and safety of adefovir treatment in post-liver transplantation patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV, neither were adefovir-resistant mutations identified in patients after 21 months of therapy, nor were there adverse events, especially renal toxicity."
6974,0.003,3.0,"Patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis receive multiple blood transfusions and, thus, are susceptible to infections transmitted through blood and blood products, including infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To determine the prevalence of antibody to HIV among patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis in Baltimore and Boston in 1985, we conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study. Repeatedly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-positive serum samples were tested by Western blot analysis. Among 435 patients in Baltimore, 12 (2.8%) were seropositive by both ELISA and Western blot techniques. Among 90 patients in Boston, three (3.3%) were seropositive. Among 100 frozen serum samples obtained from another Boston hemodialysis population in 1980, only one was seropositive. Many repeatedly ELISA-positive specimens were observed in each of the three groups studied, especially the serum samples that had been stored at -30 degrees C to -70 degrees C for four years. Most were nonspecifically reactive as demonstrated by reactivity with an H9-control ELISA plate. Patients undergoing hemodialysis, many of whom have received frequent transfusions in the past, are at increased risk for prior infection with HIV. Serologic testing for either screening or case-finding purposes must be conducted with great attention to specificity; serum samples frozen for prolonged periods are especially likely to be nonspecifically ELISA positive. These findings have implications concerning case-finding purposes, dialysis procedures, renal transplantation, and seroepidemiologic research."

We conducted a prospective observational study of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected immigrants who visited the Infectious Diseases Department of the Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain, during June 2010-May 2011. Screening of the most prevalent tropical diseases (intestinal parasitosis, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis) was performed according to geographic origin. A total of 190 patients were included: 141 (74.2%) from Latin America, 41 (21.6%) from sub-Saharan Africa, and 8 (4.2%) from northern Africa. Overall, 36.8% (70 of 190) of the patients had at least one positive result for any parasitic disease: 5 patients with positive Trypanosoma cruzi serology, 11 patients with positive Schistosoma mansoni serology, 35 patients with positive Strongyloides stercoralis serology, 7 patients with positive Leishmania infantum serology, intestinal parasitosis were detected in 37 patients, malaria was diagnosed in one symptomatic patient. We propose a screening and management strategy of latent parasitic infections in immigrant patients infected with HIV."
8461,0.003,3.0,"Chronic hepatitis B is widespread and represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality due to the evolution to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This study was designed to improve the national laboratory surveillance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, focusing on genomic analysis of isolates from Romanian patients. Sera from ten patients with HBV were collected and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on a DNA fragment spanning almost the entire genome. The occurrence of mutations was assessed for each open reading frame in the viral genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five isolates belonging to genotype A (subgenotype A2) and other five clustering with genotype D strains (subgenotype D1). Two patients treated with lamivudine were found to carry isolates harboring rtM204V lamivudine resistance mutation. An HBV isolate displaying a lamivudine complex resistance pattern, rtM204I in conjunction with rtL180M and rtA200V, was found in a lamivudine naïve patient. All samples harbored sA105P substitution, usually found in HBIg therapy escape isolates. Three of the studied strains were simultaneously displaying T1753, T1762 and A1764 mutations which in vitro induce enhanced genome replication and reduction of HBeAg expression. The sequence obtained from a patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis presents a novel type of insertion consisting of nine nucleotides between positions 260 and 261 in the X gene. Despite the small number of samples, our findings suggest the need to determine the drug resistance pattern for each patient before taking a therapeutic decision and also highlight the necessity of knowing the real level of drug resistance among HBV strains circulating in Romania."

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of liver cirrhosis, its main causes and clinical presentation in HIV+ patients. Observational, cross-sectional, retrospective study of all HIV+ individuals followed at one reference HIV outpatient clinic in Madrid. Liver fibrosis was measured in all cases using transient elastometry (FibroScan). All 2168 HIV+ patients on regular follow-up (76% males, 46% injecting drug users) were successfully examined by FibroScan) between October 2004 and August 2006. Liver cirrhosis was recognized in 181 (overall prevalence, 8.3%), and the main aetiologies were HCV, 82.3%; HBV, 1.6%; dual HBV/HCV, 2.8%; and triple HBV/HCV/ hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection, 6.6%. The prevalence of cirrhosis differed among patients with distinct chronic viral hepatitis: HCV, 19.2%; HBV, 6.1%; HBV/HCV, 41.7%; and HBV/HCV/HDV, 66.7%. In 12 patients with cirrhosis (6.7%), no definite aetiology was recognized. Overall, cirrhotics had lower mean CD4 counts than noncirrhotics (408 vs 528 cells/microL respectively; P = 0.02), despite similar proportion of subjects with undetectable viraemia on highly active antiretroviral therapy. Clinical manifestations of liver cirrhosis were: splenomegaly, 61.5%; oesophageal varices, 59.8%; ascites, 22.6%; encephalopathy, 12.1%; and variceal bleeding, 6.1%. Liver cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation events are relatively frequent in HIV+ individuals. Chronic HCV and alcohol abuse, but not chronic HBV, play a major role. Transient elastometry may allow the identification of a significant number of HIV+ individuals with asymptomatic liver cirrhosis."
2564,0.003,3.0,"The use of gallium scanning in the treatment of patients with AIDS has been well described. In this study, 27 HIV-infected patients (Walter Reed Staging Classification I-V) with normal chest roentgenograms were evaluated to determine the occurrence of thoracic gallium abnormalities in early HIV infection. SPECT was used for gallium scanning. Patients received gallium injection on day 1 and bronchoalveolar lavage on day 2, and scanning was performed on day 3. Twenty-eight scans in 27 patients were performed. Mean nodal SPECT activity was compared with corresponding values for lung parenchyma, bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts, and peripheral blood T4 lymphocyte counts. No relationship between nodal and parenchymal activity and cell counts was observed. Although visual scan interpretation was unaffected, gallium activity was significantly increased in the region of bronchoalveolar lavage compared with uptake in other lung regions. It is concluded that SPECT gallium scanning demonstrates significant gallium avidity in recently lavaged lung areas, although no impact on visual scan interpretation was seen. Further, no correlation was seen between the degree of nodal uptake and the immunologic status of these patients with early HIV infection."
2388,0.003,3.0,"Despite the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) continues to cause a major impact worldwide. HIV-induced lung disease continues to represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality, although the spectrum of pulmonary diseases has changed. HIV significantly affects the lung, causing acute and chronic cellular changes in the alveolar space. The impact of ART on lung immunology still needs to be fully elucidated. Similar to the periphery, ART affects HIV viral load and reconstitutes CD4(+) T cells in the lung. ART has been associated with significant decreases in bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytes and increases in B-cell numbers and functionality, resulting in improved immune responses to vaccinations. There are substantial clinical implications of these ART-induced alterations, including the emergence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and the increased incidences of noninfectious lung diseases, such as lung cancer and chronic obstructive lung disease. There continues to be many unanswered questions regarding the effects of ART on lung health and, in particular, the immune system. Growing knowledge in this area will hopefully diminish the incidence of these noninfectious lung diseases and further improve the health of individuals living with HIV. "
7176,0.003,3.0,"Polymerized human serum albumin virus receptors (pHSA-R) HBsAg, HBeAg, antiHBc-IgM, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA polymerase activity and HBV-DNA were studied in 47 acute hepatitis B patients, divided into three groups: 26 HBeAg(+) initially, with favorable outcome; 4 HBeAg (+), with chronic outcome; and 17 antiHBe (+), with favorable outcome. In the basal sample only 2 and 8 patients in Group I were HBV-DNAp and HBV-DNA positive, respectively, and became negative during the follow-up. In contrast all patients in Group II remained positive to both HBV-markers. After a one-month follow-up 100% of the patients in Group II were positive for pHSA-R and HBeAg, in contrast to 25% among those with a favorable outcome in Group I (p less than 0.005). Meanwhile, only 6 out of 17 patients in Group III remained positive for pHSA-R. A significant decrease in pHSA-R and HBsAg concentrations was observed in patients from Group I (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.05, respectively) 15 days after the onset of the disease, while concentrations of both parameters did not vary in Group II. A significant decrease in HBsAg and pHSA-R concentrations was found in patients from Group III after 15 days (p less than 0.05) and one month follow-up (p less than 0.05), respectively. As a result, pHSA-R and HBeAg are the best prognostic indicators in acute hepatitis B. A decrease in HBsAg and pHSA-R concentrations two weeks after the onset may have predictive value."
7593,0.003,3.0,"Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) occurs in 3-7% of liver transplant recipients (LTR). However, few data exist on the recent epidemiology, predictors and outcomes of CDI in LTR. A cohort study was performed including LTR from 2000 to 2010 at a tertiary care hospital in Detroit. CDI was defined as diarrhea with a stool C. difficile positive test. Data analyzed included demographics, comorbidities, length of stay (LOS), severity of CDI, rates of recurrence (<12 weeks), relapse (<4 weeks) and overall mortality. Predictors of CDI were calculated using Cox proportional hazard model; 970 LTR were followed for years. Overall prevalence of CDI was 18.9%. Incidence of CDI within 1 year of transplant was 12.4%. Severe CDI occurred in 29.1%. CDI recurrence and relapse rates were 16.9% and 9.7%, respectively. Independent predictors of CDI were year of transplant (hazard ratio [HR] 1.137, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.22; p < 0.001), white race (105/162 whites, HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03-2.1; p = 0.035), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.045, p = 0.003) and LOS (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.005-1.02, p < 0.001). Significant mortality was observed among LTR with CDI compared to those without CDI (p = 0.003). We concluded that CDI is common among LTR and is associated with higher mortality. "
4120,0.003,3.0,"CD8+ T lymphocytes of HIV-1 infected individuals produce a soluble factor that efficiently suppresses HIV-1 replication at the transcriptional level. We show here that the response of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) to mitogenic or Tat-mediated activation is sensitive to the suppressive action of a Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-transformed CD8+ T cell clone from an HIV-infected individual and supernatants from CD8+ T cells of HIV-1-infected asymptomatic subjects (CD4+ > 350/microliters). Mutagenesis of NF kappa B or Sp-1 elements within the LTR resulted in no change in the ability of CD8+ T cell supernatants to inhibit Tat- or mitogen-mediated LTR transcription. However, the response to HIV-1 Tat by a LTR in which the interleukin (IL)-2 homology NFAT-1 region was mutated resulted in almost complete elimination of suppression by CD8+ T cells. This was not observed when the NFAT-1 mutant LTR was activated by mitogen. We have previously shown that gene expression directed by the HIV-1 NF kappa B elements is inhibited by CD8+ cell-derived supernatants (Copeland et al., AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses, 1995;11:1321-1326). Taken together, these observations suggest that mitogenic activation, mediated primarily through the NF kappa B enhancer, is susceptible to CD8-mediated inhibition, however, inhibition of Tat-mediated activation may rely upon a different pathway that is NFAT-1 dependent."
7231,0.003,3.0,"Recent genome-wide association studies report that the SNP rs8099917, located 8.9 kb upstream of the start codon of IL28B, is associated with both disease chronicity and therapeutic response to pegIFN-α and RBV in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. To determine the effect of rs8099917 variation on the response of HCV to therapy, we genotyped this variant in a cohort of 160 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients in our clinic unit who received combined peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy. The rs8099917 T/G or G/G genotypes were observed in 56 patients (35%). Treatment failure occurred in 80% of G-allele carriers versus 48% of non-carriers (P<0.0001). This result reveals that the G allele was strongly associated with treatment failure in this patient cohort. Importantly, a highly significant association was found between the G-allele and response to therapy in HCV genotype 1-infected patients (P<0.0001) but not in HCV genotype 3-infected patients. Multivariate analysis (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval; P value) indicated that the rs8099917 TT genotype was a strong predictor of treatment success (5.83; 1.26-26.92; P = 0.021), independent of baseline plasma HCV-RNA load less than 500 000 IU/ml (4.85; 1.18-19.95; P = 0.025) and absence of advanced liver fibrosis (5.24; 1.20-22.91; P = 0.025). These results reveal the high prevalence of the rs8099917 G allele in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients as well as its strong association with treatment failure in HCV genotype 1-infected patients. rs8099917 SNP genotyping may be a valid pre-treatment predictor of which patients are likely to respond to treatment in this group of difficult-to-treat HCV/HIV-infected patients."

1948,0.003,3.0,Minnesota is currently home to the tenth largest African population and the second largest East African population in the United States. HIV is increasingly being diagnosed in African-born persons in Minnesota. A retrospective survey was conducted on all African-born patients in our HIV clinic between January 1994 and June 2005. We identified 237 patients who were African-born and HIV-positive. They constituted 12% of patients attending the clinic within the study timeframe. There was no significant difference in the ages of the African-born and non-African patients in the HIV clinic. African-born patients were more likely to be women compared with non-African patients (p < 0.001). Forty-three percent of the African-born patients presented with AIDS as defined by CD4(+) T cell counts less than 200 cells per milliliter compared to 33% of antiretroviral naïve non-African HIV patients in the clinic (p < 0.001). Most patients were infected through heterosexual contact and only 4% were diagnosed as a result of routine testing. Seven known HIV subtypes and four unique recombinant forms were identified. The most common opportunistic infection was pulmonary tuberculosis. African immigrants with HIV appear to: (1) access care at later stages of HIV disease than other patients in our clinic; (2) are often infected with non-B subtypes; (3) do not routinely get tested for HIV. Increased awareness to this growing trend is needed for health care providers and public health officials to tailor educational programs and prevention efforts for African immigrants in the United States.

In this report, propagation of PML-type JCV in COS-7-derived cell lines stably expressing HIV-1 Tat (COS-tat cells) has been examined. In COS-tat cells, production of viral particles and replication of genomic DNA were markedly increased compared to COS-7 cells, as judged by HA and real-time PCR analyses. These results demonstrate that COS-tat cells provide a useful model system for studying HIV-1 Tat-mediated propagation of PML-type JCV."
7567,0.003,3.0,"The Tat (trans-activator of transcription) regulatory protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) acts by interacting with the TAR RNA domain of nascent viral transcripts and with cellular proteins to increase viral transcription. In Jurkat-derived HCLE-D36 cells, which are stably transfected with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene expressed from the TAR-encoding long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV-1, CAT protein expression is dependent on Tat. The Tat9-K-biotin peptide antagonist of Tat binds specifically to TAR RNA and competes with Tat for binding. In the cellular expression system, Tat9-K-biotin reduces Tat-dependent CAT expression. However, while the Tat antagonist greatly reduces CAT protein production and polysome association of CAT mRNA, it has little effect on CAT mRNA levels, suggesting that the antagonist works at the post-transcriptional level."
9376,0.003,3.0,"The increasing prevalence of HIV-1 subtype B' in China and Southeast Asia calls for efforts to develop a relevant animal model to study viral transmission and pathogenesis. Because there are significant differences between subtype B' HIV-1 and other chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency viru (SHIVs) in the env gene, a novel SHIV, designated SHIV(B'WHU), was generated by replacing counterparts of SHIV(SF33) with tat/rev/vpu/env genes derived from a primary, CCR5-tropic, subtype B' HIV-1 strain of a Chinese patient. SHIV(B'WHU) was able to replicate in rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells and used CCR5 as its major coreceptor. Moreover, after serial passages in Chinese macaques, the in vivo infectivity of SHIV(B'WHU) was enhanced, yet no significant sequence changes were found in viral envelopes, and the virus did not change its CCR5-tropism. CD4(+) T-cell loss, however, was found in the intraepithelial lymphocytes of small intestines of infected macaques. Our findings have implications in understanding the early pathogenesis of SHIV(B'WHU) in Chinese macaques."

Assessment of HIV serostatus of hospitalized patients is rarely performed, however, because of a reluctance to intrude on patient confidentiality, a perceived lack of benefit (no antiretroviral therapy is available), and societal denial. We evaluated the effect on health care of HIV testing of patients routinely admitted to medical wards in the 2 major city hospitals in Harare, Zimbabwe. Of 196 patients tested, 58% were HIV positive with strong associations with infectious diseases, and with youth and weight loss, but not with cardiac, pulmonary, endocrinologic, or renal diagnoses, and not with rural versus urban location, occupation, sex, mortality, or cost of hospitalization. The clinical estimate of patients' HIV serostatus was largely inaccurate. Mandatory HIV testing of all hospitalized patients would improve diagnosis of infectious diseases, clarify patient prognosis, allow for individual counseling with regard to HIV prevention, and focus national health efforts by providing alarming, realistic statistics."
9046,0.003,3.0,"A cross-sectional study was conducted on HIV-infected adults being treated with antiretroviral drugs at a reference service in Southern Brazil. Participants answered a sociodemographic questionnaire and were tested by scales assessing sociocognitive variables. Adherence to treatment was assessed by a self-report inventory developed for the study. Clinical information was obtained from the patients' records. Significance tests were conducted using univariate logistic regressions followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 195 patients participated in the study and 56.9% of them reported > or = 95% adherence on the previous two days. In univariate analysis, the odds of adherence increased with self-efficacy (a person's conviction that he/she can successfully execute the behavior required to produce a certain desired outcome) in taking medications as prescribed (OR = 3.50, 95% CI 1.90-6.55), and decreased with perception of negative affect and physical concerns (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.95). The odds were lower for taking antiretroviral medications >4 times a day (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.20-0.94) and higher for patients with 8 years of schooling (OR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.12-4.66). In the multivariate analysis, self-efficacy (OR = 3.33, 95% CI 1.69-6.56) and taking medication >4 times a day (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.80) were independently associated with adherence. Self-efficacy was the most important predictor of adherence, followed by number of times antiretroviral medication was taken per day. Among sociodemographic and clinical variables, only the number of years of schooling was associated with adherence. Motivational interventions based on self-efficacy may be useful for increasing treatment adherence."
3018,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B is a serious public health problem throughout the world. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) induces acute hepatitis with a case-fatality rate of about 1%. Even more important, 5-10% of patients infected with HBV become chronic carries and about 25% of these will die due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The reservoir of HBV chronic carriers in the world is estimated at more than 200 million people and 80% of them reside in Asia and the western Pacific. In high-incidence areas, such as south-east Asia, perinatal transmission of HBV from carrier mothers to newborns appears to be the most important factor for the high prevalence of HBV infection and 70-90% of infants born to HBsAg/HBeAg-positive mothers become chronic carriers. Three possibilities of transmission of HBV from carrier mothers to newborns are suggested: (a) transplacental transmission in utero - it was estimated that such transmission occurred in 5-15% of newborns; (b) transmission during delivery, which is considered the main mode of perinatal transmission; (c) postnatal transmission from mother to newborn, which is not common. HBeAg is the main maternal factor in determining whether infection of newborns will occur; the expression of this antigen seems to be determined genetically. Recently it has shown that immunoprophylaxis is highly effective in preventing the development of the carrier state in infants born to HBsAg/HBeAg-positive mothers. Only 5-10% of high-risk infants are not protected by vaccination. If it becomes possible to immunize the entire world population including all babies born to carrier mothers at birth, and if our knowledge of the mechanisms of perinatal transmission of HBV is accurate, the carriers and acute cases of HB ought to disappear in two to three generations."
1279,0.003,3.0,"A study was undertaken to assess the state of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in hemodialysis patients. From 97 hemodialysis patients tested, 51 were found to have at least one hepatitis B virus specific marker. 18 were HBsAg carriers, 12 of these carriers have to be regarded as infectious as judged from the presence of HBeAg and/or HBV-specific DNA polymerase activity in the serum. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were found in the sera of approximately 20% of the hemodialysis patients with a high prevalence in cases which lacked HBV markers. We conclude from our study that HBsAg-positive hemodialysis patients should be dialyzed in a separate unit and preferably served by personnel which is anti-HBs-positive. The question whether patients in which anti-HBc represents the only HBV marker should be separated is still open and needs further work. The role of non-A/non-B infection is difficult to determine and further studies are needed to elucidate this question."
2295,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered to be the most important target for the diagnosis and immune prophylaxis of HBV infection. HBsAg-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are extensively used for studying the complex structure of the HBsAg, mapping the neutralizing epitopes and development of HBV diagnostic tests. However, the efficiency of anti-HBV binding strongly depends on the epitope structure and MAb capability to recognize different HBV variants. In the current study, 9 MAbs against yeast-expressed HBsAg of ayw2 serotype were generated and 7 of them were shown to recognize a linear epitope comprising amino acid (aa) residues 119-GPCRTCT-125 within the main antigenic ""a"" determinant of HBsAg. One MAb of the highest affinity (clone HB1) was selected for detailed cross-reactivity studies, generation of recombinant single-chain antibody (scFv) and molecular modelling of antibody-epitope interaction. The importance of each aa residue within the identified MAb epitope was determined by alanine substitution study that revealed aa residues C(121), T(123), C(124) and T(125) as essential for binding. These aa residues are highly conserved among HBV variants. In contrast, alanine substitution of G119, P120 and R122 had no or minor influence on the reactivity with the MAb. Certain aa residues at position 122 (either R or K) define different HBV serotypes (either d or y), therefore, the affinity of the MAb HB1 for the epitope with R122K substitution was determined to evaluate its diagnostic potential. The MAb recognized both epitope variants with high affinity. Sequence alignment of the MAb epitope within different HBV strains demonstrated that the shortest peptide recognized by the MAb 121-CR(K)TCT-125 is identical among different human HBV genotypes (HBV A-F, H) and monkey HBV species (HBVCP, HBVGO, HBVGB, WMHBV). In line with these data, the MAb HB1 was cross-reactive in Western blot with a large panel of antigens derived from different HBV genotypes. Recombinant scFv consisting of immunoglobulin VH and VL regions joined by a 20 aa-long linker was generated by cloning the respective cDNA sequences from hybridoma HB1. The recombinant scFv generated in Escherichia coli recognized the same epitope as the parental MAb HB1. Cloning of HB1 VH and VL regions allowed determination of their primary structure and subsequent computer modeling of antibody-epitope interaction. The generated molecular models of HB1 variable region with its target peptides were in accordance with experimental data showing the importance of certain aa residues in antibody binding. In conclusion, the current study describes new HBsAg-specific antibodies with HBV-neutralizing potency and a broad cross-reactivity against different HBV strains. The generated MAb HB1 will be of great value in diagnostic and research settings, while the recombinant HB1-derived scFv represents a promising ""building block"" for producing anti-HBV tools with a potential biopharmaceutical application.

3986,0.003,3.0,"An integrated HIV-1 genomic DNA leads to an infected cell becoming either an active or a latent virus-producing cell. Upon appropriate activation, a latently infected cell can result in production of progeny viruses that spread the infection to uninfected cells. The host proteins influence several steps of HIV-1 infection including formation of the preintegration complex (PIC), a key nucleoprotein intermediate essential for integration of reverse transcribed viral DNA into the chromosome. Much effort has gone into the identification of host proteins contributing to the assembly of functional PICs. Experimental approaches included the use of yeast two-hybrid system, co-immunoprecipitation, affinity tagged HIV-1 viral proteins and in vitro reconstitution of salt-stripped PIC activity. Several host proteins identified using these approaches have been shown to affect HIV-1 replication in cells and influence catalytic activities of recombinant IN in vitro. However, the comprehensive identification and characterization of host proteins associated with HIV-1 PICs of infected cells have been hindered in part by the technical limitation in acquiring sufficient amount of catalytically active PICs. To efficiently identify additional host factors associated with PICs in infected cells, we have developed the following novel approach. The catalytically active PICs from HIV-1-infected CD4+ cells were isolated using biotinylated target DNA, and the proteins selectively co-purifying with PICs have been analyzed by mass spectrometry. This technology enabled us to reveal at least 19 host proteins that are associated with HIV-1 PICs, of which 18 proteins have not been described previously with respect to HIV-1 integration. Physiological functions of the identified proteins range from chromatin organization to protein transport. A detailed characterization of these host proteins could provide new insights into the mechanism of HIV-1 integration and uncover new antiviral targets to block HIV-1 integration."

A total of 541 MSM was recruited using peer-referral, community outreach, and Internet. Questionnaire-based interviews provided information including, demographics, sexual and other risk behaviors. HIV prevalence was 4.8%, syphilis 19.8%, HCV 0.4% and HBsAg 6.5%. The median number of lifetime male sex partners was ten. In the past 3 months, 20.7% drank alcohol > or =1 times per week. In the past month, 21.3 and 14.6% had unprotected anal intercourse with regular and casual male sex partners, respectively. Syphilis infection was associated with less education, alcohol use, finding male sex partners through bathhouses/public washrooms/parks, and diagnoses of sexual transmitted diseases (STDs). Syphilis is now epidemic among Beijing's MSM. Prevention efforts are urgent as HIV prevalence is already near 5%. Education, condom promotion, STD control, and alcohol-related intervention are needed urgently."
1998,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) utilizes a distinctive form of gene regulation as part of its life cycle, termed programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting, to produce the required ratio of the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins. We carried out a sequence comparison of 1,000 HIV-1 sequences at the slippery site (UUUUUUA) and found that the site is invariant, which is somewhat surprising for a virus known for its variability. This prompted us to prepare a series of mutations to examine their effect upon frameshifting and viral infectivity. Among the series of mutations were changes of the HIV-1 slippery site to those effectively utilized by other viruses, because such mutations would be anticipated to have a relatively mild effect upon frameshifting. The results demonstrate that any change to the slippery site reduced frameshifting levels and also dramatically inhibited infectivity. Because ribosomal frameshifting is essential for HIV-1 replication and it is surprisingly resistant to mutation, modulation of HIV-1 frameshifting efficiency potentially represents an important target for the development of novel antiviral therapeutics."
7651,0.003,3.0,"Several cell clones possessing the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome, consisting of an almost full-length DNA sequence, were isolated by limiting dilution of the clonal cell line M10 derived from MT-4 that survived infection with HIV-1 vpr mutant (M10/vpr-). One of the isolated clones (termed Vpr-1) expressed only doubly spliced mRNA, but not unspliced or singly spliced mRNA. Western blots of Vpr-1 revealed the presence of the nef translation product, although no expression of major structural genes such as gag, pol, and env was detected by indirect immunofluorescence and assay of reverse transcriptase activity. These HIV-1 phenotypes differed greatly from those of the original M10/vpr-, most of which expressed major structural HIV-1 proteins. Despite undetectable levels of env expression in Vpr-1, CD4 antigens were greatly down-modulated on the surface without alteration of steady-state levels of CD4 mRNA expression, similar to M10/vpr-. These HIV-1 phenotypes in Vpr-1 did not change after the treatment of the cells with both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin. Therefore, the abnormal HIV-1 life cycle in Vpr-1 seems to be due to some viral factor(s), as well as cellular factors. Thus, Vpr-1 could be a useful model for understanding one HIV-1 latent form."
4530,0.003,3.0,"In the United States, 10 million inmates are released every year, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevalence is several-fold greater in criminal justice populations than in the community. Few effective linkage-to-the-community programs are currently available for prisoners infected with HIV. As a result, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is seldom continued after release, and virological and immunological outcomes worsen. Poor HIV treatment outcomes result from a myriad of obstacles that released prisoners face upon reentering the community, including homelessness, lack of medical insurance, relapse to drug and alcohol use, and mental illness. This article will focus on 5 distinct factors that contribute significantly to treatment outcomes for released prisoners infected with HIV and have profound individual and public health implications: (1) adaptation of case management services to facilitate linkage to care; (2) continuity of cART; (3) treatment of substance use disorders; (4) continuity of mental illness treatment; and (5) reducing HIV-associated risk-taking behaviors as part of secondary prevention."

High attrition rates have been reported in the Caribbean region, varying from 6% to 23%. We studied the incidence of and risk factors for intermittent care in a cohort of adult HIV-1-positive patients, who entered into care in Curaçao between January 2005 and July 2009. A total of 214 therapy-naïve HIV-1-infected patients aged 15 years or older, entered HIV care between January 2005 and July 2009. Intermittent care was defined as at least one period of 365 days or longer in which there was no HIV care contact in Curaçao. Cox regression models were used to identify characteristics associated with time to intermittent care. In all, 203 (95%) patients could be classified as having intermittent or continuous care. The incidence of intermittent care before starting cART was 25.4 per 100 person years observation (PYO), whilst it was 6.1 per 100 PYO after starting cART. Being born outside Curaçao was associated with intermittent care before and after starting cART. Time from diagnosis to entry into care was an independent predictor for intermittent care before starting cART. Younger age was independently associated with intermittent care after starting cART. Half of the patients returned to care after intermitting care. Upon returning to care, median CD4 count was 264 cells/mm(3) (IQR, 189-401) for those who intermitted care before starting cART, and 146 cells/mm(3) (IQR, 73-436) in those who intermitted care after starting cART. In conclusion, the incidence of intermitting care is high in Curaçao, especially before starting cART, and intermitting care before starting cART is an independent predictor for starting cART late. "

A retrospective questionnaire survey was conducted of infants and children with HIV exposure or infection evaluated by pediatric HIV referral centers in the United States comprising the pediatric units or subunits of the Pediatric Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Clinical Trials Group (PACTG). Seventy of 72 sites during a mean period of 5 (range, 1 to 12) years participated in this study and had provided care for 14,038 patients. There were 75 cumulative total cases of tuberculosis disease seen since each site was established. Therapy for asymptomatic infection was given to another 40 children and for tuberculosis exposure to 71 children. Annualized case rates were 478/100,000 for sites established in 1990 to 1992, 117/100,000 for 1988 to 1989, 63/100,000 for 1986 to 1987 and 58/100,000 for 1981 to 1985 (P = 0.05, Spearman's p test for trend). By comparison, the 1992 age-specific tuberculosis case rate for all U.S. children < 5 years was 5.5/100,000.

782,0.003,3.0,"This study is the first prospective study to assess the prevalence, epidemiology, and risk factors of HIV-1 drug resistance in newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients in Belgium. In January 2003 it was initiated as part of the pan-European SPREAD program, and continued thereafter for four inclusion rounds until December 2006. Epidemiological, clinical, and behavioral data were collected using a standardized questionnaire and genotypic resistance testing was done on a sample taken within 6 months of diagnosis. Two hundred and eighty-five patients were included. The overall prevalence of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance in Belgium was 9.5% (27/285, 95% CI: 6.6-13.4). Being infected in Belgium, which largely coincided with harboring a subtype B virus, was found to be significantly associated with transmission of drug resistance. The relatively high rate of baseline resistance might jeopardize the success of first line treatment as more than 1 out of 10 (30/285, 10.5%) viruses did not score as fully susceptible to one of the recommended first-line regimens, i.e., zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz. Our results support the implementation of genotypic resistance testing as a standard of care in all treatment-naive patients in Belgium."

A convenience sample of 358 gay men was recruited in two gay bars. Exploratory factor analysis performed on the first split-half sample was used to assess the factor structure from five scales measuring beliefs about HBV vaccination. The scales were based on constructs from the health belief model and the social cognitive theory. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the remaining half-sample using structural equation modeling. Multivariable analysis further validated the scales. These findings propose standardized measures that may be useful in assessing the beliefs and attitudes of gay men toward HBV vaccination to guide intervention design and evaluation."

7794,0.003,3.0,"Studies examining the sex differences in morbidity and mortality among HIV/AIDS patients have yielded inconsistent results. We conducted a meta-analysis of sex differences in disease progression and mortality among HIV/AIDS patients. Medical literature databases from inception to August 2014 were searched for published observational studies assessing sex differences in immunologic and virologic response, disease progression and mortality among HIV-infected patients. Random effects meta-analyses of 115 eligible studies were conducted to obtain pooled estimates of outcomes and heterogeneity was explored in sub-group analyses. Pooled estimates showed an increased risk of progression to AIDS (relative risk [RR]=1.11,95% CI=1.02-1.21) and all-cause mortality (RR=1.23, 95% CI=1.17-1.29) among males compared to females. All-cause mortality differed by sex only in low and middle income countries. The risk of AIDS-related mortality (RR=1.03, 95% CI=0.82-1.30), immunologic failure (RR=1.19,95% CI: 0.97-1.47), virologic suppression (RR=0.98, 95% CI=0.84-1.14), virologic failure (RR=1.26, 95% CI=0.99-1.61) and the change in CD4 cell count (Weighted mean difference [WMD] = -5.15, 95% CI= -13.57 to 3.28) did not differ by sex. These findings were modified by disease severity, adherence and use of highly active antiretroviral therapy. We conclude that HIV-related disease progression and survival outcomes are poorer in males. "

It is a multi-centre, prospective observational study conducted between August 1997 and July 1998. The 483 patients, enrolled in five infectious diseases departments located in different areas of Italy, were stratified into four groups according to their CD4+ lymphocyte cell count and status of AIDS Defining Illness (ADI) at enrolment. Average direct hospital costs (L = Italian Lire, 1997 exchange rate US$ 1 = 1,704 Italian Lire) were L.23,725,584 (US$ 13,923.5), L.15,208,287 (US$ 8,925.1), L.11,942,761 (US$ 7,008.7) and L.7,660,942 (US$ 4,495.9) for the four groups of patients. More than 80% of patients in the first group and about 65% of patients in the second group received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The proportion of patients receiving HAART in the third and fourth group increased from 37.1% to 56.5% and from 15.3% to 31.5%.

2798,0.003,3.0,"Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a widely used procedure for AIDS-related lymphomas, and it represents an opportunity to evaluate strategies curing HIV-1 infection. The association of autograft HIV-DNA load with peripheral blood HIV-1 reservoir before ASCT and its contribution in predicting HIV-1 reservoir size and stability during combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) after transplantation are unknown. Aiming to obtain information suggesting new functional cure strategies by ASCT, we retrospectively evaluated HIV-DNA load in autograft and in peripheral blood before and after transplantation in 13 cART-treated HIV-1 relapse/refractoring lymphoma patients. Among them seven discontinued cART after autograft infusion. HIV-DNA was evaluated by a sensitive quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After debulking chemotherapy/mobilization, the autograft HIV-1 reservoir was higher than and not associated with the peripheral HIV-1 reservoir at baseline [median 215 HIV-DNA copies/10(6) autograft mononuclear cells, range 13-706 vs. 82 HIV-DNA copies/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), range 13-479, p = 0.03]. After high dose chemotherapy and autograft infusion, HIV-DNA levels reached a plateau between month 6 and 12 of follow-up. No association was found between peripheral HIV-DNA levels at baseline and after infusion in both cART interrupting and not interrupting patients. Only in the last subgroup, a stable significant linear association between autograft and peripheral blood HIV-1 reservoir emerged from month 1 (R(2) = 0.84, p = 0.01) to month 12 follow-up (R(2) = 0.99, p = 0.0005). In summary, autograft HIV-1 reservoir size could be influenced by the mobilization phase and predicts posttransplant peripheral HIV-1 reservoir size in patients on continuous cART. These findings could promote new research on strategies reducing the HIV-1 reservoir by using the ASCT procedure."
2258,0.003,3.0,"Comparative sequence analysis of different isolates of hepatitis G virus (HGV) has demonstrated significant intersubject genetic heterogeneity, but few data on intrasubject genetic evolution have been reported. To further investigate the genetic diversification of the HGV genome, 36 plasma samples from eleven patients chronically infected with HGV serially obtained 2-4 years apart were analysed. We determined the viral nucleotide sequence of the 5' non-coding (NC) and the NS3 regions by directly sequencing the RT-PCR amplified products obtained from the viral RNAs. Intrasubject sequence variation was found to be 1.3-2.4 x 10(-3) base substitutions per genome site per year within the 5' NC region and 1.3-9.4 x 10(-3) base substitutions per genome site per year within the NS3 region. Depending on the genomic region analysed (i.e. 5' NC or NS3 region), pairwise comparisons and phylogenetic reconstructions showed that intersubject genetic distances were 17.5- to 20.8-fold greater than intrasubject ones. Overall, the evolution rate of HGV in the regions analysed is not significantly different from that found in hepatitis C virus."
3239,0.003,3.0,"HIV-1 RNA levels in semen and blood compartments decrease below detection limits during highly active antiretroviral therapy. Despite these therapeutic effects, it is clear that persistent, latent HIV-1 reservoirs are capable of rebounding in the absence of drug treatment or by evolution of escape mutants remain. The current study was designed to examine the presence of latent virus in semen and blood compartments and its evolution following potent combination therapy with indinavir (protease inhibitor) and efavirenz [nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor]. Using an ultrasensitive in situ hybridization assay HIV-1 mRNA was detected in cultured seminal and blood mononuclear cells in all patients up to 1789 days posttherapy. Higher levels of HIV-1 mRNA were consistently detected in seminal mononuclear cells as compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in all time points analyzed posttherapy. Analysis of viral RNA from cultured PBMC before and after therapy displayed no evidence of therapy-induced drug resistance in the viral polymerase gene in the majority of patients. However, distinct envelope populations were detected in these viral RNA populations following therapy, indicating possible selection of quasispecies. The observed ongoing replication and evolution in the PBMC viral envelope sequences likely occurred in the seminal compartment HIV populations, given that the seminal cells showed the ability to express HIV-1 mRNA following cultivation. This together with our previous studies (Gupta P, et al.: J Infect Dis 2000;182:79-87) suggest that the genital and blood compartments likely serve as distinct reservoirs harboring latent HIV-1 during prolonged drug therapy."

QOL and medical data were collected from 1,563 of the 1,571 participants at entry into a randomized clinical trial of ART conducted in the U.S. (n = 203) and 8 resource-limited countries (n = 1,360) in the Caribbean, South America, Asia, and Africa. Participants were interviewed prior to initiation of ART using a modified version of the ACTG SF-21, a health-related QOL measure including 8 subscales: general health perception, physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, pain, mental health, and energy/fatigue. Other measures included demographics, CD4+ lymphocyte count, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load. Higher quality of life in each of the 8 QOL subscales was associated with higher CD4+ lymphocyte category. General health perception, physical functioning, role functioning, and energy/fatigue varied by plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load categories. Each QOL subscale included significant variation by country. Only the social functioning subscale varied by sex, with men having greater impairments than women, and only the physical functioning subscale varied by age category. This was the first large-scale international ART trial to conduct a standardized assessment of QOL in diverse international settings, thus demonstrating that implementation of the behavioral assessment was feasible. QOL indicators at study entry varied with disease severity, demographics, and country. The relationship of these measures to treatment outcomes can and should be examined in clinical trials of ART in resource-limited settings using similar methodologies."

We analyzed data from the N2R study which was an open label, randomized, comparative trial comparing treatment outcomes between 71 TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients receiving efavirenz (EFV)-based and nevirapine (NVP)-based ART; all of whom were receiving RMP-containing anti-TB treatment. Demographic data, liver function test, CD4 cell count, plasma HIV-1 RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody were collected before initiating ART (week 0). Liver enzymes and total bilirubin levels were monitored at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after ART initiation. All patients were followed until TB therapy was completed. Of 142 patients, 8 patients were excluded. Among the remaining 134 patients, the mean+/-SD age was 36.8+/-8.6 years and 67.2% were male. Severe hepatotoxicity (grade 3 or 4) developed in 4 patients (2.9%); 3 patients (4.6%) in the NVP group and 1 patient (1.4%) in the EFV group. Severe hyperbilirubinemia (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 7 patients (5.2%); 5 patients (7.7%) in the NVP group and 2 patients (2.9%) in the EFV group. Grade 1 or 2 hepatotoxicity occurred in 34 patients (31.4%). Hepatitis C virus co-infection (adjusted OR 3.03; 95%CI 1.26-7.29) was an independent risk factor associated with grade 1-4 hepatotoxicity (p=0.013). Monitoring of hepatotoxicity should be considered in TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients who are infected with HCV and receiving NVP."
3057,0.003,3.0,"The woodchuck together with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) is an excellent model to study the pathogenesis of hepadnaviral infections. Chronic WHV infection causes severe liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma in woodchucks. The mechanism of viral clearance is not fully understood, interferons seem to play a major role in down-regulating viral replication prior to elimination of infected hepatocytes. We investigated on the pattern of cytokine and T-cell-marker expression in livers of woodchucks chronically infected with WHV. RNase-protection-assay (RPA) was used to determine mRNA of woodchuck specific genes (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-15, CD3, CD4, CD8). Serial liver biopsies were performed daily or weekly in eight chronic WHV-carrier woodchucks. Cytokine/T-cell-marker expression differed significantly between the time points up to +/-50% within each woodchuck. The different expression patterns of cytokines or T-cell-markers did not correlate to the (weak) fluctuations in the viremia but may explain the observed fluctuations in the WHV/HBV-load in chronically infected individuals. Furthermore, we observed associations between cytokine and T-cell-marker expression. The marginal fluctuations in viremia during the chronic infection may indicate, that, once the chronic hepadnaviral infection is established, cytokines/interferons expressed endogenously (i.e. not vector-borne or injected) play only a minor role."
998,0.003,3.0,"In 2005, Pakistan was first labeled as a country with concentrated epidemic of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This was revealed through second generation surveillance conducted by HIV/AIDS Surveillance Project (HASP). While injection drug users (IDUs) were driving the epidemic, subsequent surveys showed that Hijra (transgender) sex workers (HSWs) were emerging as the second most vulnerable group with an average national prevalence of 6.4%. An exceptionally high prevalence (27.6%) was found in Larkana, which is a small town on the right bank of river Indus near the ruins of Mohenjo-Daro in the province of Sindh. This paper presents the risk factors associated with high prevalence of HIV among HSWs in Larkana as compared to other cities of the country."
8865,0.003,3.0,"The deleterious effect of HIV on the immune system begins at the time of infection. At seroconversion the virologic and immunologic factors that ultimately will dictate the rate of disease progression are believed to be already in place. The concept developed in this paper implies that, to impact significantly on the progression of disease, anti-HIV therapies should be initiated as early as possible in asymptomatic individuals. Published results have shown that combination drug therapies are potent in reducing HIV-1 RNA load in plasma in asymptomatic individuals, and that some HIV-1 immune-based therapies have a positive impact on immunological markers of disease progression, including HIV-1 cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and CD4 percent. The strategy discussed is to test a combination of antiretroviral therapy with HIV-1 immune-based therapy, such as the inactivated HIV-1 immunogen preparation, in asymptomatic individuals. The goal of this combination approach is to overcome the limitations of each therapy alone. Preliminary data suggest that antiretroviral therapy and the HIV-1 Immunogen can be combined with no noticeable interference and/or added toxicity in a broad range of HIV-1-infected individuals. Combining both therapies may enhance and expand the impact on key surrogate markers of disease progression, although they likely achieve this impact through different mechanisms. Thus, the primary question remains: Can these effects be synergistic?"
487,0.003,3.0,"Twenty cases of systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in HIV-infected patients were reviewed over a 10-year-period, divided into Group A, including 13 NHL cases treated before the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, and Group B, including 7 patients who received HAART. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was performed and log-rank was applied to assess statistical differences between the groups. In group A, the median CD4 count was 36 cells/mm3. No complete remission was found. In group B, the median CD4 count was 137 cells/mm3. Four patients (57.0%) are still alive and in complete remission. Group A had a median survival of 5 months and group B 31 months (p = 0.0032). Our results are in agreement with recent reports in that a higher CD4 count and better immune status achieved with HAART is predictive of a better outcome. We found that HAART in combination with chemotherapy improves overall survival of NHL patients without increasing adverse effects."
10011,0.003,3.0,"Virus-specific CD8(+) T cells play a central role in the control of viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. However, despite the presence of strong and broad HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in chronic HIV-1 infection, these cells progressively lose critical effector functions and fail to clear the infection. Mounting evidence suggests that the upregulation of several inhibitory regulatory receptors on the surface of CD8(+) T cells during HIV-1 infection may contribute directly to the impairment of T-cell function. Here, we investigated the role of killer immunoglobulin receptors (KIR), which are expressed on NK cells and on CD8(+) T cells, in regulating CD8(+) T-cell function in HIV-1 infection. KIR expression was progressively upregulated on CD8(+) T cells during HIV-1 infection and correlated with the level of viral replication. Expression of KIR was associated with a profound inhibition of cytokine secretion, degranulation, proliferation, and activation by CD8(+) T cells following stimulation with T-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent stimuli. In contrast, KIR(+) CD8(+) T cells responded potently to TCR-independent stimulation, demonstrating that these cells are functionally competent. KIR-associated suppression of CD8(+) T-cell function was independent of ligand engagement, suggesting that these regulatory receptors may constitutively repress TCR activation. This ligand-independent repression of TCR activation of KIR(+) CD8(+) T cells may represent a significant barrier to therapeutic interventions aimed at improving the quality of the HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell response in infected individuals."
5636,0.003,3.0,"We investigated the role of the two highly conserved cysteine residues, cysteines 67 and 95, of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease in regulating the activity of that protease during viral maturation. To this end, we generated four HIV-1 molecular clones: the wild type, containing both cysteine residues; a protease mutant in which the cysteine at position 67 was replaced by an alanine (C67A); a C95A protease mutant; and a double mutant (C67A C95A). When immature virions were produced in the presence of an HIV-1 protease inhibitor, KNI-272, and the inhibitor was later removed, limited polyprotein processing was observed for wild-type virion preparations over a 20-h period. Treatment of immature wild-type virions with the reducing agent dithiothreitol considerably improved the rate and extent of Gag processing, suggesting that the protease is, in part, reversibly inactivated by oxidation of the cysteine residues. In support of this, C67A C95A virions processed Gag up to fivefold faster than wild-type virions in the absence of a reducing agent. Furthermore, oxidizing agents, such as H2O2 and diamide, inhibited Gag processing of wild-type virions, and this effect was dependent on the presence of cysteine 95. Electron microscopy revealed that a greater percentage of double-mutant virions than wild-type virions developed a mature-like morphology on removal of the inhibitor. These studies provide evidence that under normal culture conditions the cysteines of the HIV-1 protease are susceptible to oxidation during viral maturation, thus preventing immature virions from undergoing complete processing following their release. This is consistent with the cysteines being involved in the regulation of viral maturation in cells under oxidative stress."
2063,0.003,3.0,"Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) is a critical mediator of immunity to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Although IFN has been used in the treatment of viral hepatitis for more than a decade, the role of IFN-alpha-receptor in HBV infection has not been intensively studied. We have evaluated the impact of two variants of the IFNAR1 gene on the outcome of HBV infection. Four hundred and fifty eight HBV-infected Vietnamese patients, with well-characterised clinical profiles including all forms of hepatic disease, and 160 non-infected, healthy Vietnamese individuals were enrolled in the study. Of these patients, 54 had acute hepatitis B, 88 had chronic hepatitis B, 118 had liver cirrhosis, 146 had a hepatocellular carcinoma and 52 were asymptomatic carriers of HBV. We analysed two SNPs for unequal distribution between these groups. The first SNP, rs1012335 is situated in intron 3 of the interferon alpha receptor 1 (IFNAR1). A C at position 17470 in the IFNAR1 on both chromosomes was detected more frequently in HBV-infected patients compared to healthy controls (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.46-4.72, p < 0.001). The same homozygosity is also associated with higher concentrations of AST and ALT (aspartate and alanine amino-transferase) in the plasma of the patients. The second SNP (rs2257167) is situated in exon 4, causing a change of amino acids from Val (GTT) to Leu (CTT). Subjects having GTT on both chromosomes were more frequent in the healthy control group (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.35-0.84, p = 0.004) and had lower plasma ALT concentrations. The findings indicate that two variants of the IFNAR1 gene are associated with the clinical presentation of HBV infection."
4654,0.003,3.0,"The envelope proteins of hepatitis B virus (HBV) bear an N-linked glycosylation site at N146 within the immunodominant a-determinant in the antigenic loop (AGL) region. This glycosylation site is never fully functional, leading to a nearly 1/1 ratio of glycosylated/nonglycosylated isoforms in the viral envelope. Here we investigated the requirement for a precise positioning of N-linked glycan at amino acid 146 and the functions associated with the glycosylated and nonglycosylated isoforms. We observed that the removal of the N146 glycosylation site by mutagenesis was permissive to envelope protein synthesis and stability and to secretion of subviral particles (SVPs) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) virions, but it was detrimental to HBV virion production. Several positions in the AGL could substitute for position 146 as the glycosylation acceptor site. At position 146, neither a glycan chain nor asparagine was absolutely required for infectivity, but there was a preference for a polar residue. Envelope proteins bearing 5 AGL glycosylation sites became hyperglycosylated, leading to an increased capacity for SVP secretion at the expense of HBV and HDV virion secretion. Infectivity-compatible N-glycosylation sites could be inserted at 3 positions (positions 115, 129, and 136), but when all three positions were glycosylated, the hyperglycosylated mutant was substantially attenuated at viral entry, while it acquired resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Taken together, these findings suggest that the nonglycosylated N146 is essential for infectivity, while the glycosylated form, in addition to its importance for HBV virion secretion, is instrumental in shielding the a-determinant from neutralizing antibodies."
3659,0.003,3.0,"We report the case of an HIV-infected patient who has been followed for 20 years, and despite presenting with AIDS (due to three episodes of cryptococcosis plus one of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) who during subsequent years missed, refused or took with limited compliance all recommended medications, including combination antiretroviral therapy, and primary and secondary antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections. The unexpected clinical and laboratory stabilization of our patient paralleled a progressive increase in his peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (range 410-825 cells/mL) and a relatively controlled HIV viraemia (5970-44,000 HIV-RNA copies/mL). Such a recovery of sufficient immune competency after experiencing four episodes of severe AIDS-associated opportunistic infections, without reliable antiretroviral and antimicrobial support raises several questions."
9007,0.003,3.0,"We hypothesized that rapid presentation may be a general feature of tuberculosis (TB) associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that limits the impact of HIV on the point prevalence of TB. To investigate this, we performed a cross-sectional HIV and TB disease survey with retrospective and prospective follow-up. HIV prevalence among 1,773 systematically recruited miners was 27%. TB incidence was much more strongly HIV associated (incidence rate ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-8.6) than the point prevalence of undiagnosed TB disease (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9-3.3). For smear-positive TB, 7 of 9 (78%) prevalent cases were HIV negative, and point prevalence was nonsignificantly lower in miners who were HIV positive (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1-4.2). The calculated mean duration of smear positivity before diagnosis (point prevalence/incidence) was substantially shorter for HIV-positive than HIV-negative TB patients (0.17 and 1.15 years, respectively; ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.00-0.73). HIV has considerably less impact on the point prevalence of TB disease than on TB incidence, probably because rapid disease progression increases presentation and case-finding rates. The difference in mean duration of smear positivity was particularly marked and, if generalizable, will have major implications for TB control prospects in high HIV prevalence areas."
7447,0.003,3.0,"Commencement of antiretroviral treatment (ART) in severely immunosuppressed HIV-infected persons is associated with unmasking of subclinical disease. The subset of patients that are diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) disease while on ART have been classified as ART-associated TB. Few studies have reported the incidence of ART-associated TB and unmasking TB-IRIS according to the International Network for the Study of HIV-Associated IRIS (INSHI) consensus definition. To determine the incidence and predictors of ART-associated TB, we screened 219 patients commencing ART at the Infectious Diseases Clinic in Kampala, Uganda for TB by symptoms, sputum microscopy, and chest X-rays and followed them for one year. Fourteen (6.4%) patients were diagnosed with TB during followup. Eight (3.8%) patients had ART-associated TB (incidence rate of 4.3 per 100 person years); of these, three patients fulfilled INSHI criteria for unmasking TB-associated IRIS (incidence rate of 1.6 per 100 person years). A body mass index of less than 18.5 kg/m(2) BMI (HR 5.85 95% CI 1.24-27.46, P = .025) and a C-reactive protein greater than 5 mg/L (HR 8.23 95% CI 1.36-38.33, P = .020) were risk factors for ART-associated TB at multivariate analysis. In conclusion, with systematic TB screening (including culture and chest X-ray), the incidence of ART-associated TB is relatively low in settings with high HIV and TB prevalence."
5143,0.003,3.0,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) nearby the IL28B gene have been associated with spontaneous hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance and response to interferon-based therapies in both monoinfected and HIV-coinfected patients. However, its impact on spontaneous clearance of HBV (the pathogenesis of which is also related to interferon) is less known. A case-control study was performed. Cases were 49 HIV(+) patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBsAg(+) for more than 6 months) who had been genotyped for the rs12979860 SNP (protective CC genotype). One control for each case was chosen among HIV patients with anti-HBs and anti-HBc. Controls were matched for gender and coinfection with HCV. Most patients were male (90%) and the median (IQR) age was 42.6 (39-46.7) years. Eighteen (36.7%) were also coinfected by HCV. Among HBsAg(+) patients, 19 (41.3%) were HBeAg(+) and 13 (26.5%) were also infected with hepatitis delta (HDV). No differences were found in the distribution of the CC genotype between patients with chronic hepatitis B and those who spontaneously cured hepatitis B: 59.2% vs. 44.9%; p=0.3. Thus, the interleukin-28B (IL-28B) genotype does not seem to have a role in the development of chronic hepatitis B among HIV-infected patients."
4368,0.003,3.0,"We previously reported that inhibition of endosomal/lysosomal function can dramatically enhance human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectivity, suggesting that under these conditions productive HIV-1 infection can occur via the endocytic pathway. Here we further examined this effect with bafilomycin A1 (BFLA-1) and show that this enhancement of infectivity extends to all HIV-1 isolates tested regardless of coreceptor usage. However, isolate-specific differences were observed in the magnitude of the effect. This was particularly evident in the case of the weakly infectious HIV-1(SF2), for which we observed the greatest enhancement. Using reciprocal chimeric viruses, we were able to determine that both the disproportionate increase in the infectivity of HIV-1(SF2) in response to BFLA-1 and its weak infectivity in the absence of BFLA-1 mapped to its envelope gene. Further, we found HIV-1(SF2) to have lower fusion activity and to be 12-fold more sensitive to the fusion inhibitor T-20 than HIV-1(NL4-3). Proteasomal inhibitors also enhance HIV-1 infectivity, and we report that the combination of a lysosomal and a proteasomal inhibitor greatly enhanced infectivity of all isolates tested. Again, HIV-1(SF2) was unique in exhibiting a synergistic 400-fold increase in infectivity. We also determined that inhibition of proteasomal function increased the infectivity of HIV-1 pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. The evidence presented here highlights the important role of the lysosomes/proteasomes in the destruction of infectious HIV-1(SF2) and could have implications for the development of novel antiviral agents that might take advantage of these innate defenses."
9120,0.003,3.0,"Directly observed therapy (DOT) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is commonly used in correctional settings; however, the efficacy of DOT for treating HIV infection has not been determined. We prospectively assessed adherence to antiretroviral therapy regimens among 31 HIV-infected prison inmates who were receiving >or=1 antiretrovirals via DOT. Adherence was measured by self-report, pill count, electronic monitoring caps, and, for DOT only, medication administration records. Overall, median adherence was 90%, as measured by pill count; 86%, by electronic monitoring caps; and 100%, by self-report. Adherence, as measured by electronic monitoring caps, was >90% in 32% of the subjects. In 91% of cases, adherence, as measured by medication administration records, was greater than that recorded by electronic monitoring caps for the same medications administered by DOT. Objective methods of measurement revealed that adherence to antiretroviral regimens administered wholly or in part by DOT was <or=90% in more than one-half of the patients. Different methods used to measure adherence revealed significantly different levels of adherence. These findings suggest that use of DOT does not ensure adherence to antiretroviral therapy."

We surveyed 154 physician anesthesiologists (MD) and certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA) at four university-affiliated medical centers to determine the prevalence of serologic markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Questionnaires were used to ascertain historical and demographic information, nonoccupational risk factors, and characteristics of the participants' anesthesia practice. The overall prevalence of seropositivity was 18.8% (range 10.2-30.3%), and there were no statistically significant differences among the four centers, MD and CRNA groups, or males and females. In contrast to other studies, the prevalence of seropositive markers did not increase with an increase in the participants' age or length of time in the specialty. For the groups sampled in this study, geographic location or type of practice did not influence the increased prevalence of HBV seropositivity in anesthesia personnel. The current methods of HBV infection control were not associated with a decreased prevalence of serum markers. The majority of the susceptible anesthesia personnel at these four institutions did not plan to receive the hepatitis B vaccine when surveyed at the time of this study."
6196,0.003,3.0,"Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global health problem and an important cause of morbidity and mortality from sequelae of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the past decades, better understanding of the natural history and immunopathogenesis of chronic HBV infection and of the development of many powerful antiviral agents has allowed us to improve therapeutic efficacy. Among these agents, nucleos(t)ide analogs are important and potent viral suppressors. However, when administered alone, they are not able to permanently eradicate HBV, and long-term maintenance therapy is required for therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, prolonged treatment is frequently associated with the emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants. Before an 'ideal' drug(s), or drug combination, with optimal antiviral efficacy and negligible rates of drug resistance becomes available, the on-treatment monitoring approach using serum HBV DNA level as a predictor for therapeutic efficacy and drug resistance is useful. However, most countries in the Asia-Pacific region have low income economies, insufficient medical care systems, and low awareness of the disease among the general population and government officers. The easy approach of the road-map concept using an affordable drug to treat chronic HBV infection is more important in this region. There is already evidence that the long-term outcomes of chronic HBV infection can be improved under well-managed antiviral therapy. Profound and long-lasting suppression of HBV replication, either maintained on-therapy or sustained after stopping therapy, has been identified as the key determinant for achieving the goals of therapy, for reducing liver damage, and for preventing development of cirrhosis and/ or hepatocellular carcinoma."

The aims of this study were to determine the role of core promoter and/or precore mutations in HBeAg seroconversion and their impact on the subsequent course of liver disease, and to determine if core promoter mutations are more frequently selected in patients with HBV genotypes that preclude the development of precore stop codon mutation. Serial sera from 45 patients with chronic HBV infection were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified, and the HBV core promoter and precore regions were sequenced. Ninety-two percent of patients had core promoter or precore mutations after HBeAg seroconversion: 42% had core promoter changes only, 38% had precore stop codon mutations only, and 12% had changes in both regions. Seventy-three percent of the patients had persistently normal aminotransferases, and only 8% had multiple flares in aminotransferases after HBeAg seroconversion. Core promoter changes were significantly more common in patients infected with HBV who have C at nucleotide 1858 (91% vs. 27%; P <.01), while precore stop codon changes were exclusively found in patients infected with HBV who have T at nucleotide 1858 (87% vs. 0; P <.01). The vast majority of our patients had core promoter and/or precore mutations after HBeAg seroconversion. Nevertheless, most patients had sustained remission of liver disease. Our data suggest that core promoter changes are preferentially selected in patients infected with HBV genotypes that preclude the development of precore stop codon mutation."
7434,0.003,3.0,"Around 5-10% of adults infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) develop a chronic liver disease such as chronic active hepatitis (CAH), and it is unclear whether the clinical outcome depends solely on the immune response or whether viral factors also play a role. In this study, a search was therefore made for nucleotide mutations in the basic core promoter (BCP) and amino-acid substitutions in the precore/core region of HBV infecting patients with CAH or with acute hepatitis. The nucleotide sequences of the BCP and of the precore/core region were determined in virus from ten patients with CAH and ten with acute hepatitis. The precore/core sequences were also analysed in 14 additional patients (6 with CAH, 8 with acute hepatitis). In seven of the ten patients with CAH, five types of mutations were found in the BCP. Deletions in the precore/core region were observed in six patients. In all six patients where only the precore/core region was studied, amino-acid substitutions were present. In contrast, in the ten patients with acute hepatitis studied for BCP, a mutation was found in the BCP of one patient only. Of the 18 patients in whom the precore/core was studied, three had an amino-acid substitution in this region. The results show a clear link between CAH and both HBV BCP and precore/core region mutations, suggesting these mutations may play a role in the persistence of HBV infection."

HCV and HIV viral load, lymphocyte CD4 counts, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) were measured before and 3 months after starting treatment in 2 groups: Group 1 (n = 15) treated with 2 nucleoside analogues and Group 2 (n = 15) treated with 2 nucleoside analogues and a protease inhibitor. Results show a significant increase in lymphocyte and a significant decrease in HIV viral load in the both group but no significant change in HCV viral load and in ALT and AST.

Hepatitis B virus infection is a significant health problem which may cause chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. With the introduction of Hepatitis B vaccine, a significant progress has been made in the prevention of HBV infections. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the characteristics of the individuals included in the risk group who admitted to our vaccination clinic, as well as their immune responses following the vaccination. Among the patients admitted to the vaccination clinic of our hospital between January 2003-December 2005 and that were included in the risk group (patients who have family members with chronic Hepatitis B infection, healthcare workers, hemodialysis patients etc.), those who were included in the vaccination program by examining the results of HBs Ag, anti-HBc and anti-HBs were evaluated in terms of their characteristics (age, gender, smoking etc.) and results of Anti-HBs score. A total of 958 people were included in the vaccination program. Upon evaluation in terms of risk factors, presence of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection in the family was found to be 80.6% (772/958), being healthcare worker was 9.2% (88/958), HCV positivity and chronic liver disease was 3.0% (29/958), being a hemodialysis patient was 2.8% (27/958), and being an oncology patient was 2.1% (20/958). Post-vaccination immune response could be evaluated in 69.8% (669/958) of patients and no responsiveness to vaccine was detected only in 8.1% (54/669) of them. Of the non-responders, 64.8% (35/54) were hemodialysis and oncology patients. Anti-HBs positivity rate following hepatitis B vaccination program was found compatible with the results of previous studies. With this vaccine of considerably high effectiveness, immunization of the entire community including primarily the risk groups should be targeted."

The objective of the workshop was to identify appropriate biosafety practices and standard control procedures to protect workers involved in the collection, storage, and transportation of human blood donations with the least possible disruption of the nation's blood supply. Speakers focused on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV); however, the safety principles discussed were considered equally applicable to other known (e.g., non-A, non-B hepatitis and human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) blood-transmitted infections. The resulting consensus included the need for blood establishments to develop and apply thoughtful biosafety programs to address staff training, accident prevention, HBV vaccination, handling spills, managing contaminated waste and transporting blood specimens. There was lack of agreement, however, on the usefulness of gloves during the phlebotomy of healthy blood donors."

Immediately after delivery, babies were randomized to receive either HBIG or placebo in addition to recombinant HBV vaccine (at 0, 6, 10 and 14 weeks). The primary end-point of the study, assessed at 18 weeks of age, was remaining free of any HBV infection (either overt or occult) plus the development of adequate immune response to vaccine. The babies were further followed up for a median of 2 years of age to determine their eventual outcome. Risk factors for HBV transmission and for poor immune response in babies were studied. Of the 283 eligible babies, 259 were included in the trial and randomized to receive either HBIG (n=128) or placebo (n=131) in addition to recombinant HBV vaccine. Of the 222 of 259 (86%) babies who completed 18 weeks of follow-up, only 62/222 (28%) reached primary end-point. Of the remaining, 6/222 (3%) developed overt HBV infection, 142/222 (64%) developed occult HBV infection, and 12/222 (5%) had no HBV infection but had poor immune response. All 6 overt infections occurred in the placebo group (P=0.030), while occult HBV infections were more common in the HBIG group (76/106 [72%] vs. 66/116 [57%]; P=0.025). This may be due to the immune pressure of HBIG. There was no significant difference between the two groups in frequency of babies developing poor immune response or those achieving primary end-point. The final outcome of these babies at 24 months of age was as follows: overt HBV infection 4%, occult HBV infection 42%, no HBV infection but poor immune response 8% and no HBV infection with good immune response 28%. Women who were anti-HBe positive were a low-risk group, and their babies were most likely to remain free of HBV infection (occult or overt) and had good immune response to the vaccine. Maternal HBeAg-positive status and negativity for anti-HBe predicted not only overt but also any infection (both overt and occult) in babies. In addition, high maternal HBV DNA and treatment with vaccine alone were significant factors for overt HBV infection in babies. The current practice of administration of vaccine with HBIG at birth to babies born of HBsAg-positive mothers is not effective in preventing occult HBV infection in babies, which may be up to 40%. Because the most important risk factors for mother-to-baby transmission of HBV infection are the replicative status and high HBV DNA level in mothers; it will be worthwhile investigating the role of antivirals and HBIG administration during pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HBV infection."
3214,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence of occult hepatitis B, defined by absence of HBsAg and HBV DNA, ranges widely in patients with hepatitis C. This may influence the treatment of hepatitis C and the severity of liver disease. Sensitive and specific real-time PCR techniques are available commercially and can detect more reliably low HBV DNA levels. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection using the COBAS Taqman assay (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) in the serum and liver of HBsAg negative patients with chronic hepatitis C and to evaluate its clinical consequences on liver pathology and its impact on the response to treatment with peg-IFNalpha and Ribavirin. HBV DNA detection was assessed retrospectively on 140 sera and 113 liver biopsies of HCV positive/HBsAg negative patients before treatment. A 4.4% (5/113) prevalence of occult hepatitis B was recorded in liver samples and in none of the sera. Anti-HBc was not detected in one, three of whom were sustained virological responders to treatment, one was relapsed responder and one was non-responder. Furthermore, in this cohort composed of 12% anti-HBs negative/anti-HBc positive and 20% anti-HBs positive/anti-HBc positive patients, anti-HBc was not associated with pre-therapeutic viral load, ALT serum levels, and histological activity or fibrosis. Using a commercial real-time PCR assay, we observed a low prevalence of occult B hepatitis. This, just as anti-HBC status, had no clinical impact in a large cohort of hepatitis C patients. It therefore does not appear useful to screen for occult hepatitis B in these patients with this test before beginning HCV treatment."
4820,0.003,3.0,"4000 sera were tested for antibodies against hepatitis C virus (HCV) by means of an ELISA using the C100-3 antigen. 38.9% of patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis following blood transfusion (n = 108) had HCV antibodies. Among patients with chronic liver damage of unknown origin (n = 316) 30.4% were anti-HCV positive, and in 2,506 patients with transitional or chronic elevation of transaminases 14.8% showed HCV antibodies. Haemophiliacs (n = 26) with 65.4% anti-HCV positives and drug addicts (n = 46) with 56.5% anti-HCV positives had the highest prevalence among high risk groups. Addicts dying from drug abuse (n = 216) and HIV 1 positives (n = 127) were anti-HCV positive in 37.5% and 26.0%, respectively. Patients on haemodialysis (n = 331) had antibodies against HCV in 12.4%. Health care workers (n = 217) appear to be at a comparably low risk with only 2.8% anti-HCV positives. Up to now we could not find a single case of intrafamilial spread of HCV in 46 examined cases. We suggest that HCV infectivity of contaminated body fluids and blood is lower than that of hepatitis B virus or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 carriers. In suspected non-A, non-B hepatitis negative test results should be confirmed in a second sample because it may take three to six months after infection before HCV antibodies occur. However, about 10% of chronic HCV infections are not detectable with the presently available test. This may change when new tests become available using HCV specific antigens other than C100-3."
6799,0.003,3.0,"Chronic infection with hepatitis B or C viruses is a common underlying condition in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. We studied serum and liver tissue from a cohort of Alaska natives with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for evidence of hepatitis B, C and G viral infection using conventional serological tests as well as the sensitive polymerase chain reaction. Evidence of HBV infection was found in 25 and possible HCV infection in two cases. Among the remaining 11 patients, four had a history of recent or remote alcoholism while seven had no recognizable risk factors for HCC. Only one was seropositive for HGV RNA and that was an individual with a history of alcoholism. Non-tumorous liver tissue was available for study in six of these seven cases. Histological features of chronic hepatitis were present in five. Thus, at least five of 38 (13%) Alaska natives with HCC appeared to have chronic hepatitis not related to HBV or HCV infection, suggesting the possibility of some form of previously unrecognized chronic liver disease predisposing to HCC."
6425,0.003,3.0,"Loss of E-cadherin is associated with acquisition of metastatic capacity. Numerous studies suggest that histone deacetylation and/or hypermethylation of CpG islands in E-cadherin gene (CDH1) are major mechanisms responsible for E-cadherin silencing in different tumors and cancer cell lines. The hepatitis B virus (HBV)-encoded X antigen, HBx, contributes importantly to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma using multiple mechanisms. Experiments were designed to test if in addition to CDH1 hypermethylation HBx promotes epigenetic modulation of E-cadherin transcriptional activity through histone deacetylation and miR-373. The relationships between HBx, E-cadherin, mSin3A, Snail-1 and miR-373 were evaluated in HBx expressing (HepG2X) and control (HepG2CAT) cells by western blotting, immunoprecipitation (IP), chromatin IP as well as by immunohistochemical staining of liver and tumor tissue sections from HBV-infected patients. In HepG2X cells, decreased levels of E-cadherin and elevated levels of mSin3A and Snail-1 were detected. Reciprocal IP with anti-HBx and anti-mSin3A demonstrated mutual binding. Furthermore, HBx-mSin3A colocalization was detected by immunofluorescent staining. HBx downregulated E-cadherin expression by the recruitment of the mSin3A/histone deacetylase complex to the Snail-binding sites in human CDH1. Histone deacetylation inhibition by Trichostatin-A treatment restored E-cadherin expression. Mir-373, a positive regulator of E-cadherin expression, was downregulated by HBx in HepG2X cells and tissue sections from HBV-infected patients. Thus, histone deacetylation of CDH1 and downregulation of miR-373, together with the previously demonstrated hypermethylation of CDH1 by HBx, may be important for the understanding of HBV-related carcinogenesis."
7857,0.003,3.0,"Abacavir (1592U89) ((-)-(1S, 4R)-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene- 1-m ethanol) is a 2'-deoxyguanosine analogue with potent activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1. To determine the metabolic profile, routes of elimination, and total recovery of abacavir and metabolites in humans, we undertook a phase I mass balance study in which six HIV-infected male volunteers ingested a single 600-mg oral dose of abacavir including 100 microCi of [(14)C]abacavir. The metabolic disposition of the drug was determined through analyses of whole-blood, plasma, urine, and stool samples, collected for a period of up to 10 days postdosing, and of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), collected up to 6 h postdosing. The radioactivity from abacavir and its two major metabolites, a 5'-carboxylate (2269W93) and a 5'-glucuronide (361W94), accounted for the majority (92%) of radioactivity detected in plasma. Virtually all of the administered dose of radioactivity (99%) was recovered, with 83% eliminated in urine and 16% eliminated in feces. Of the 83% radioactivity dose eliminated in the urine, 36% was identified as 361W94, 30% was identified as 2269W93, and 1.2% was identified as abacavir; the remaining 15.8% was attributed to numerous trace metabolites, of which <1% of the administered radioactivity was 1144U88, a minor metabolite. The peak concentration of abacavir in CSF ranged from 0.6 to 1.4 microg/ml, which is 8 to 20 times the mean 50% inhibitory concentration for HIV clinical isolates in vitro (0.07 microg/ml). In conclusion, the main route of elimination for oral abacavir in humans is metabolism, with <2% of a dose recovered in urine as unchanged drug. The main route of metabolite excretion is renal, with 83% of a dose recovered in urine. Two major metabolites, the 5'-carboxylate and the 5'-glucuronide, were identified in urine and, combined, accounted for 66% of the dose. Abacavir showed significant penetration into CSF."
1452,0.003,3.0,"In a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individual, immune-pressure-mediated positive selection operates to maintain the antigenic polymorphism on the gp120 third variable (V3) loop. Recently, we suggested on the basis of sequencing C2/V3 segments from an HIV-1 subtype E-infected family that a V3 sequence lineage group of the non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) variants (group 1) was relatively resistant to positive selection pressure (35). To better understand the relationship between the intensity of positive selection pressure and cell tropism of the virus, we determined the linkage between each V3 genotype and its function of directing coreceptor preference and MT2 cell tropism. The biological characterization of a panel of V3 recombinant viruses showed that all of the group 1 V3 sequences could confer an NSI/CCR5-using (NSI/R5) phenotype on HIV-1(LAI), whereas the group 2 V3 sequence, which was more positively charged than the group 1 sequence, dictated mainly a syncytium-inducing, CXCR4-using (SI/X4) phenotype. Phylogenetic analysis of C2/V3 sequences encoding group 1 or 2 V3 suggested that the variants carrying group 1 V3 are the ancestors of the intrafamilial infection and persisted in the family, while the variants carrying group 2 V3 evolved convergently from the group 1 V3 variants during disease progression in the individuals. Finally, a statistical test showed that the V3 sequence that could dictate an NSI/R5 phenotype had a synonymous substitution rate significantly higher than the nonsynonymous substitution rate. These data suggest that V3 sequences of the subtype E NSI/R5 variants are more resistant to positive selection pressure than those of the SI/X4 variants."
2315,0.003,3.0,"Individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are generally divided into asymptomatic healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver disease. Several studies have suggested that the hepatitis B core antigen could be an immunological target of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). To investigate the possible pressure site from CTL, the entire core region of HBV DNA was sequenced in 30 subjects (10 asymptomatic healthy carriers and 20 patients with chronic liver disease). No significant changes in the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid residue were noted in the 10 healthy carriers. In contrast, a cluster of changes in a small segment of 18 amino acids (codons 84-101 from the start of the core gene) was found in 15 of the 20 chronic liver disease patients. All these 15 patients had advanced liver diseases (chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis), whereas only mild liver disease (chronic persistent hepatitis) was found in the five patients without mutations. These data suggest that the region with mutation clustering is the major target of CTL, and that the mutations evolve under the pressure of immune selection."
7786,0.003,3.0,"To provide additional information on the acquisition of host cell membrane proteins by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) produced by natural cellular reservoirs, two different field isolates were used to infect ex vivo expanded peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and human lymphoid tissue histocultures. The insertion of host-derived HLA-DR, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), CD40, CD40L, and CD86 within HIV-1 particles was evaluated by using specific antibodies linked to a solid matrix to capture ultrafiltrated viral progeny. Overall, our data indicate that neither the HIV-1 co-receptor usage (i.e., T-tropic or macrophage-tropic) nor the cellular source of HIV-1 has an impact on the incorporation process but it was found to be under the influence of the donor source. Given that most viral replication is thought to occur in lymphoid tissues and previous works have shown that HIV-1 life cycle is affected by several virus-anchored host proteins, our results suggest that this phenomenon is likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of this retroviral infection."
2205,0.003,3.0,One hundred patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were investigated for serological markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and had liver function evaluated. One patient had hepatitis B surface antigen and 25 had antibodies to HBsAg which is not significantly different from normal blood donor controls. Minor liver function abnormalities were found in 35 patients and there was no difference between those with and without anti-HBs. A single patient without HBV markers had more severe liver enzyme elevation. Our data do not show a relationship between SLE and HBV and support the contention that liver diseases in lupus is mild.
1127,0.003,3.0,"The HIV epidemic in Vietnam is concentrated, with high prevalence estimates among injection drug users and commercial sex workers. Socio-demographics, substance use and clinical correlates of antiretroviral therapy non-adherence were studied in 100 HIV-1 infected drug users receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months in Hanoi, Vietnam. All study participants were men with a mean age of 29.9 ± 4.9 years. The median duration on antiretroviral therapy was 16.2 ± 12.7 months; 83% reported 'very good' or 'perfect' adherence in the past 30 days on a subjective one-item Likert scale at time of study enrollment; 48% of participants reported drug use within the previous 6 months, with 22% reporting current drug use. Injection drug use with or without non-injection drug use in the past 6 months (95% C.I. 2.19, 1.30-3.69) and years on antiretroviral therapy (95% C.I. 1.43, 1.14-1.78) were correlated with suboptimal adherence. These findings support Vietnam's ongoing scale-up of harm reduction programmes for injection drug users and their integration with antiretroviral therapy delivery. Moreover, results highlight the need to identify and implement new ways to support high levels of antiretroviral therapy adherence as duration on antiretroviral therapy increases. "
1423,0.003,3.0,"The safety and clinical impact of isoprinosine in HIV-infected individuals were assessed in a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, 24-week study phase, followed by an optional 24-week open treatment phase. The results of the double-blind phase have been reported. Of 866 HIV-seropositive patients randomized, 832 subjects were eligible for efficacy analysis. On completion of the double-blind phase, 596 patients started open treatment. All patients were evaluated with regard to progression to AIDS and/or death. Within 48 weeks, 10/412 (2.4%) patients assigned isoprinosine and 27/420 (6.4%) patients assigned placebo progressed to AIDS (P = 0.005). Intention-to-treat analysis showed identical results. Viewing the open treatment phase in isolation revealed no difference in progression rates between those treated and those not receiving the drug, perhaps reflecting the higher proportion of patients receiving zidovudine or PCP prophylaxis in the latter group. No severe adverse reactions or toxicities were observed. We conclude that HIV-seropositive patients without AIDS may be safely and effectively treated with isoprinosine."
3284,0.003,3.0,"Improvements in HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been accompanied by increasing recognition of the importance of adherence to treatment regimens for maximizing patient benefits while minimizing the emergence of drug-resistant virus. Whether clinicians should screen patients for adherence and only administer therapy to those believed likely to adhere has not been resolved. We first examine the implications of data drawn from a recent study reporting physicians' ability to predict whether patients will adhere to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or not. We then extend previously developed mathematical models of ART to include screening for adherence and focus on resulting drug resistance as well as on HIV and AIDS incidence at the population level. We show that although screening for adherence is likely to reduce the level of drug resistance compared with a policy of treating all HIV patients with HAART, rates of new HIV infections and AIDS cases in the population would likely increase unless screening accuracy is extremely (perhaps implausibly) high."
2122,0.003,3.0,"Dexamethasone inhibited human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR)-directed gene expression in cells of T and B lymphoblastoid lineages, but not in monocytic cells. Suppression required an intact glucocorticoid receptor (GR), as it was amplified by transfection of lymphocytes with a plasmid encoding the human GR and blocked by the receptor antagonist RU486. These results were in direct contrast to the effects of dexamethasone on a murine leukemia retrovirus promoter where, consistent with the findings of others, activation of gene expression was obtained. Potential regions of the HIV-1 LTR mediating these effects were sought, with sequence homologies predicting two new glucocorticoid response element half-sites, GRE-II (nucleotides -6 to -1) and GRE-III (+ 15 to + 20), downstream from a previously identified GR DNA binding domain, GRE-I (-264 to -259). Mutational analyses documented the loss of inhibitory activity attendant on changes in GRE-III and the independence of steroid-mediated effects from GRE-I and GRE-II. Consistent with these findings, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a difference in binding of cellular factors to GRE-III in cells of T and B lymphocyte vs. monocytic lineages. Binding sites for the cellular transcription factor leader binding protein (LBP-1) were found to overlap with GRE-III, and LBP-1 interacted with this element in the HIV LTR only in T and B lymphocytic extracts. We hypothesize that GRE-III sequence-specific effects, including modulation of LBP-GR interactions, underlie the negative regulatory effect of glucocorticoids on HIV-1 gene expression, with some specificity for cell type."
8914,0.003,3.0,"Reports of an increased proportion of AIDS cases occurring in small and medium-sized cities suggest that the HIV epidemic may be spreading into locations that were previously characterized by their low HIV antibody prevalences. Studying the question of the geographic spread of the HIV infection epidemic (rather than the AIDS epidemic) has been difficult largely because most serial seroprevalence data have been gathered from cohorts of high risk individuals (e.g., homosexual/bisexual cohorts) in New York City, San Francisco, and other geographically circumscribed areas. The U.S. military applicant HIV screening data were used in the current report to examine rates and 24 month temporal trends in geographic areas characterized by their HIV endemicities. The data examined concern the seven most populous states and four hyperendemic metropolitan areas located within those states (New York City, Miami, Houston, and San Francisco). In the nonepidemic regions, seroprevalence rates increased among black and white applicants. In the four epidemic urban areas, only young black applicants had higher HIV seroprevalence rates during the second 12 month period. Six of the seven nonepidemic regions had positive HIV seroprevalence trends, and these trends were significant in Florida, California, Texas, Illinois, and Ohio. The increases in these regions were greater for young blacks (30% excess for year 2 vs. year 1) compared to young whites (12% excess for year 2 vs. year 1). These data provide evidence of birth year specific increases in seroprevalence over time occurring in presumed low HIV prevalence areas. These increases cannot be due to, but are observed in spite of, biases associated with increasing self-selection over time."
5333,0.003,3.0,"Viral blips, where HIV RNA plasma viral load (pVL) intermittently increases above the lower limit of assay detection, are a cause for concern. We investigated a number of hypotheses for their cause. We assessed HIV RNA, and total and episomal HIV DNA from 16 individuals commencing antiretroviral therapy (ART) consisting of raltegravir and tenofovir/emtricitabine for 3 years, using two assays: a single-copy assay [SCA; lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), <1 copy/ml] and the Amplicor assay (LLOQ of 50 copies/ml). Two individuals exhibited viral blips. From week 20 onward, the period where ART had achieved its final suppressive levels, pVL ranged from <1 to 330 copies/ml, except for one individual at the final time. Both assays were 98% consistent (108/110) in assessing pVL <50 copies/ml, but the Amplicor assay registered 56% of samples (19/34) as below the LLOQ that were in the 50 to 1000 copy/ml range as quantified by SCA. pVL changes between successive time points did not correlate with changes in cellular infection as measured through either total or episomal HIV DNA. Changes in pVL were correlated (negatively) with changes in total CD4(+) T cell numbers (p=0.003), naive (CD45RO(-)CD62L(+)CD4(+)), natural regulatory (CD45RO(-)CD25(+)CD127(-)CD4(+)), activated effector (CD45RO(+)CD38(++)CCR5(+)CD8(+)), but not activated (CD38(+)HLA-DR(+)) CD4(+) T cells. Patients receiving stable, seemingly suppressive ART can have pVL near the 50 copy LLOQ at multiple time points. The high Amplicor assay error rate around this level implies that viral blips underrepresent pVL being more consistently above the LLOQ. Activation of latently infected cells is less likely to contribute to this phenomenon."
1953,0.003,3.0,"Infectious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was recovered from two out of four bowel biopsy specimens from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with chronic diarrhoea of unknown aetiology. In-situ hybridisation of biopsy specimens from rectum and duodenum of other AIDS patients with gastrointestinal complaints showed the presence of HIV-infected cells in both the base of the bowel crypts and the lamina propria. The type(s) of epithelial cell(s) infected could not be determined definitively. However, the association of in-situ labelling of HIV RNA in argentaffin staining cells strongly suggests that enterochromaffin cells derived from neural crest tissue are among the target cells. This evidence that HIV can directly infect the bowel raises the possibility that the virus causes some of the gastrointestinal disorders of AIDS patients."

In this study, we examined several combinations of K-12 and other antiretroviral agents for their inhibitory effects on HIV-1 replication in acutely and chronically infected cell cultures. Combinations of K-12 and a reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor, either zidovudine, lamivudine, or nevirapine, synergistically inhibited HIV-1 replication in acutely infected MT-4 cells. The combination of K-12 and the protease inhibitor nelfinavir (NFV) also synergistically inhibited HIV-1, whereas the synergism of this combination was weaker than that of the combinations with the RT inhibitors. K-12 did not enhance the cytotoxicities of RT and protease inhibitors. Synergism of the combinations was also observed in acutely infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The combination of K-12 and cepharanthine, a nuclear factor kappa B inhibitor, synergistically inhibited HIV-1 production in tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated U1 cells, a promonocytic cell line chronically infected with the virus. In contrast, additive inhibition was observed for the combination of K-12 and NFV. These results indicate that the combinations of K-12 and clinically available antiretroviral agents may have potential as chemotherapeutic modalities for the treatment of HIV-1 infection."
8456,0.003,3.0,"High rates of mutation and recombination help human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to evade the immune system and develop resistance to antiretroviral therapy. Macrophages and T-cells are the natural target cells of HIV-1 infection. A consensus has not been reached as to whether HIV replication results in differential recombination between primary T-cells and macrophages. Here, we used HIV with silent mutation markers along with next generation sequencing to compare the mutation and the recombination rates of HIV directly in T lymphocytes and macrophages. We observed a more than four-fold higher recombination rate of HIV in macrophages compared to T-cells (p < 0.001) and demonstrated that this difference is not due to different reliance on C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) co-receptors between T-cells and macrophages. We also found that the pattern of recombination across the HIV genome (hot and cold spots) remains constant between T-cells and macrophages despite a three-fold increase in the overall recombination rate. This indicates that the difference in rates is a general feature of HIV DNA synthesis during macrophage infection. In contrast to HIV recombination, we found that T-cells have a 30% higher mutation rate than macrophages (p < 0.001) and that the mutational profile is similar between these cell types. Unexpectedly, we found no association between mutation and recombination in macrophages, in contrast to T-cells. Our data highlights some of the fundamental difference of HIV recombination and mutation amongst these two major target cells of infection. Understanding these differences will provide invaluable insights toward HIV evolution and how the virus evades immune surveillance and anti-retroviral therapeutics. "

4401,0.003,3.0,"The efficacy of protease inhibitor drugs in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment is limited by the selection and expansion of drug-resistant mutations. HCV replication is error-prone and genetic variability within the dominant epitopes ensures its persistence. The aims of this study are to evaluate the role of cellular immune response in the emergence of HCV protease resistance mutations and its effects on treatment outcome. Ten chronically HCV-infected subjects were treated with boceprevir (BOC)-based triple therapy. HCV-RNA was tested for BOC resistance-associated viral variants. HCV protease resistance mutations were investigated pretreatment and 24 weeks post-treatment. Synthetic peptides representing the wild-type and the potential nonstructural (NS)3 variants were used to evaluate T cell responses and human leukocyte antigen binding. Sustained viral response was achieved in 70% of patients, two patients were treatment nonresponders (NRs) and one was classified as a relapse. Pretreatment, the proportion of drug-resistant variants within individuals was higher in sustained viral responders (SVRs) than in NR patients. However, resistance-associated variants increased in NRs after BOC combined triple therapy. In contrast to NR patients, significant stronger cell-mediated immune responses were observed at the baseline among those who achieved sustained viral response for all T cell epitopes tested. Despite the increase in cell-mediated immune responses at week 24 in NRs, they failed to control the virus replication, leading to development of overt drug-resistant variants. Our data suggest that strong NS3-specific T cell immune responses at the baseline may predict a positive outcome of directly acting antiviral-based therapy, and the presence of pre-existent resistance mutations does not play a significant role in the outcome of anti-HCV combined therapy."
8603,0.003,3.0,"Treatment with lamivudine of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) results in a high rate of drug resistance, which is primarily associated with the rtM204I/V substitution in the HBV reverse transcriptase domain. Here we show that the rtM204I/V substitution, although essential, is insufficient for establishing resistance against lamivudine. The analysis of 639 HBV whole-genome sequences obtained from 11 patients shows that rtM204I/V is independently acquired by more than one intra-host HBV variant, indicating the convergent nature of lamivudine resistance. The differential capacity of HBV variants to develop drug resistance suggests that fitness effects of drug-resistance mutations depend on the genetic structure of the HBV genome. An analysis of Bayesian networks that connect rtM204I/V to many sites of HBV proteins confirms that lamivudine resistance is a complex trait encoded by the entire HBV genome rather than by a single mutation. These findings have implications for public health and offer a more general framework for understanding drug resistance."

7696,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global public health concern. HBV causes chronic infection in patients and can lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and other severe liver diseases. Thus, understanding HBV-related pathogenesis is of particular importance for prevention and clinical intervention. HBV surface antigens are indispensable for HBV virion formation and are useful viral markers for diagnosis and clinical assessment. During chronic HBV infection, HBV genomes may acquire and accumulate mutations and deletions, leading to the expression of defective HBV surface antigens. These defective HBV surface antigens have been found to play important roles in the progression of HBV-associated liver diseases. In this review, we focus our discussion on the nature of defective HBV surface antigen mutations and their contribution to the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis B. The relationship between defective surface antigens and occult HBV infection are also discussed."
9179,0.003,3.0,"We analyzed the kinetics of CD4 cells, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load, and autoantibodies in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients with Graves' disease (GD) after immune restoration on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART; retrospective study). Five patients (median age, 41 yr) were diagnosed with GD after 20 (range, 14-22) months on HAART on the basis of clinical and biological hyperthyroidism, diffuse hyperfixation of thyroid scan, and the presence of anti-TSH receptor (anti-TSHR) antibodies (Ab). GD was diagnosed several months after the plasma HIV ribonucleic acid load became undetectable, when the CD4+ cell count had risen from 14 (range, 0-62) to 340 (range, 163-460) x 10(6) cells/L. Antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-TSHRAb appeared 14 (range, 9-18) and 14 (range, 11-20) months after starting HAART and 12 (range, 6-15) and 11 (range, 9-17) months after the increase in CD4+ cells. In 3 patients, TPOAb preceded TSHRAb by 3-10 months. No other autoantibodies were detected. Thyroid antibodies were absent in a group of 55 HIV-1-positive patients with comparable response to HAART and no symptoms of hyperthyroidism (cross-sectional study). Thyroid-specific autoimmunity can occur upon immune restoration with HAART. Our observations suggest a relationship between thymus-dependent immune reconstitution after immunosuppression and autoimmunity and may provide insight into the pathophysiology of GD."
5114,0.003,3.0,"A wide range of pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, Mycobacterium, Leishmania, and Helicobacter pylori, can interact with dendritic cell (DC)-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), expressed on DCs and a subset of B cells. More specifically, the interaction of the gp120 envelope protein of HIV-1 with DC-SIGN can facilitate the transfer of virus to CD4+ T lymphocytes in trans and enhance infection. We have previously demonstrated that a multimeric LeX component in human milk binds to DC-SIGN, preventing HIV-1 from interacting with this receptor. Biochemical analysis reveals that the compound is heat resistant, trypsin sensitive, and larger than 100 kDa, indicating a specific glycoprotein as the inhibitory compound. By testing human milk from three different mothers, we found the levels of DC-SIGN binding and viral inhibition to vary between samples. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization analysis, we identified bile salt-stimulated lipase (BSSL), a Lewis X (LeX)-containing glycoprotein found in human milk, to be the major variant protein between the samples. BSSL isolated from human milk bound to DC-SIGN and inhibited the transfer of HIV-1 to CD4+ T lymphocytes. Two BSSL isoforms isolated from the same human milk sample showed differences in DC-SIGN binding, illustrating that alterations in the BSSL forms explain the differences observed. These results indicate that variations in BSSL lead to alterations in LeX expression by the protein, which subsequently alters the DC-SIGN binding capacity and the inhibitory effect on HIV-1 transfer. Identifying the specific molecular interaction between the different forms may aid in the future design of antimicrobial agents."
3164,0.003,3.0,"System dynamics (SD) modeling belongs to the rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary field of system science research. This field adds value to more traditional health research by contributing to the design and testing of complex integrated models of change, to examine health system performance and patient outcomes. Using selected milestones in HIV care management to frame our simulation research, we created a SD model to examine three patient subgroups of women of color (WOC) represented in our multi-site cohort, classified by their health care seeking status at baseline. Asked to reflect on their circumstance 6 months prior to enrollment in the MSE cohort, 53% noted they were receiving some care (In Care, n = 341), 31% that they had been seeking care (Seeking Care, n = 201), and 16% that they were undecided about seeking care (i.e., answered that they may or may not look for care) for treatment of their HIV (May or May Not Seek Care, n = 103). Our SD model compared simulated patterns of patient retention over 24 months in relation to: (1) access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), (2) adherence to ART, and (3) viral suppression. Assessed patterns yielded insights about system capacities and constraints in the context of the SPNS initiative under evaluation."
1618,0.003,3.0,"In September 2006, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new guidelines calling for routine, voluntary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing for all persons aged 13-64 years in health care settings. These guidelines were motivated, in part, by mounting evidence that the traditional approach of using risk factors to identify candidates for HIV testing is inadequate. Of the 1.0-1.2 million people in the United States thought to be infected with HIV, approximately 25% remain unaware of their infection, and nearly half of all infected patients develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome < or = 1 year after testing positive for HIV. Also contributing to the change in testing guidelines was recent evidence that routine HIV testing is cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness analysis, a method of assessing health care interventions in terms of the value they confer, reports results in terms of the resources that are required for the intervention to produce an additional unit of change in health effectiveness; more economically efficient programs are those with lower cost-effectiveness ratios. This article reviews the methods and results of cost-effectiveness studies in the United States and articulates why routine, voluntary HIV testing is not only of crucial public health importance but also economically justified."
9304,0.003,3.0,"Since January 25, 1988, the Baltimore City Health Department has offered routine, confidential, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing to clients of the city's two sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. During the first 11 months of the program, testing was offered at 20,843 patient visits and was accepted at 15,181 (73%) of these; 612 (4%) individual clients had results that were positive for HIV. Four hundred thirty-seven (71%) seropositive clients returned for test results, post-test counseling, and further evaluation. Most HIV-infected clients were single, and black men accounted for 75% of seropositive individuals. HIV-infected women tended to be younger than infected men (7% of the female clients were adolescents). Although homosexual activity, intravenous drug use, and sex with a partner at risk were common risk factors for seropositive clients, after two interviews 17% of men and 38% of infected women did not report traditional risk factors for HIV infection. Most clients were asymptomatic or had generalized lymphadenopathy at the time of HIV diagnosis. Health care resources for these individuals were limited; 62% of men and 85% of women either had no health insurance or received public assistance. Routine, voluntary, confidential HIV counseling and testing is a practical, effective means to identify HIV-infected individuals among clients being treated at STD clinics. Identification of these individuals early in the course of infection provides opportunities to implement early follow-up and therapy, to counsel clients to help prevent further spread of infection, and to obtain useful information for projecting future health care needs and policy."
4032,0.003,3.0,"Entecavir (ETV) is a deoxyguanosine analog approved for use for the treatment of chronic infection with wild-type and lamivudine-resistant (LVDr) hepatitis B virus (HBV). In LVD-refractory patients, 1.0 mg ETV suppressed HBV DNA levels to below the level of detection by PCR (<300 copies/ml) in 21% and 34% of patients by Weeks 48 and 96, respectively. Prior studies showed that virologic rebound due to ETV resistance (ETVr) required preexisting LVDr HBV reverse transcriptase substitutions M204V and L180M plus additional changes at T184, S202, or M250. To monitor for resistance, available isolates from 192 ETV-treated patients were sequenced, with phenotyping performed for all isolates with all emerging substitutions, in addition to isolates from all patients experiencing virologic rebounds. The T184, S202, or M250 substitution was found in LVDr HBV at baseline in 6% of patients and emerged in isolates from another 11/187 (6%) and 12/151 (8%) ETV-treated patients by Weeks 48 and 96, respectively. However, use of a more sensitive PCR assay detected many of the emerging changes at baseline, suggesting that they originated during LVD therapy. Only a subset of the changes in ETVr isolates altered their susceptibilities, and virtually all isolates were significantly replication impaired in vitro. Consequently, only 2/187 (1%) patients experienced ETVr rebounds in year 1, with an additional 14/151 (9%) patients experiencing ETVr rebounds in year 2. Isolates from all 16 patients with rebounds were LVDr and harbored the T184 and/or S202 change. Seventeen other novel substitutions emerged during ETV therapy, but none reduced the susceptibility to ETV or resulted in a rebound. In summary, ETV was effective in LVD-refractory patients, with resistant sequences arising from a subset of patients harboring preexisting LVDr/ETVr variants and with approximately half of the patients experiencing a virologic rebound."
2062,0.003,3.0,"The role of the thymus in HIV-1 pathogenesis remains unclear. We developed an assay to quantify the number of recent thymic emigrants in blood based on the detection of a major excisional DNA byproduct (termed alpha1 circle) of T cell receptor rearrangement. By studying 532 normal individuals, we found that alpha1 circle numbers in blood remain high for the first 10-15 yr of life, a sharp drop is seen in the late teen years, and a gradual decline occurs thereafter. Compared with age-matched uninfected control individuals, alpha1 circle numbers in HIV-1-infected adults were significantly reduced; however, there were many individuals with normal alpha1 circle numbers. In 74 individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, we found no appreciable effect on alpha1 circle numbers in those whose baseline values were already within the normal range, but significant increases were observed in those with a preexisting impairment. The increases in alpha1 circle numbers were, however, numerically insufficient to account for the rise in levels of naive T lymphocytes. Overall, it is difficult to invoke thymic regenerative failure as a generalized mechanism for CD4 lymphocyte depletion in HIV-1 infection, as alpha1 circle numbers are normal in a substantial subset of HIV-1-infected individuals."
1171,0.003,3.0,"Tenofovir is an acyclic nucleotide analog with activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF), a bis-alkoxyester prodrug of tenofovir, is approved for the treatment of HIV and is currently being developed to treat chronic hepatitis B. In this report, we further characterize the in vitro activity of tenofovir against HBV as well as its metabolism in hepatic cells. We show that tenofovir is efficiently phosphorylated to tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) in both HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes. TFV-DP has a long intracellular half-life (95 h) and is a potent and competitive inhibitor of HBV polymerase (Ki = 0.18 microM). Tenofovir has a 50% effective concentration of 1.1 microM against HBV in cell-based assays, and potency is improved > 50-fold by the addition of bis-isoproxil progroups. Tenofovir has previously demonstrated full activity against lamivudine-resistant HBV in vitro and clinically. Here we show that the major adefovir resistance mutation, rtN236T, confers three- to fourfold-reduced susceptibility to tenofovir in cell culture; the clinical significance of this susceptibility shift has not yet been determined. The rtA194T HBV polymerase mutation recently identified in tenofovir DF-treated HIV/HBV-coinfected patients did not confer in vitro resistance to tenofovir as a single mutation or in a lamivudine-resistant viral background. Overall, the antiviral and metabolic profile of tenofovir supports its development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B."
8878,0.003,3.0,"Defective regulatory components of the immune system seem to contribute to HIV disease progression. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was reported to restore malfunctioning immunologic regulatory components. To corroborate this hypothesis, we studied different dendritic-cell (DC) and T-cell subsets with regulatory phenotype in 41 clinically stable patients with hemophilia more than 25 years after infection with HIV and 10 years after initiation of HAART. Compared with healthy controls, patients showed normal DC1 and DC2 levels, increased CD8 peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) counts and T helper (Th) 2 proportions, and decreased Th1, CD3CD4CD127, and CD3CD8CD127 PBL proportions. High viral load was associated with high DC1, whereas high CD8 PBL counts were associated with low DC2. CD3CD4CD25Foxp3 (regulatory T [Treg] cell) and CD3CD8CD28Foxp3 PBL counts (suppressor T [Ts] cell) exhibited normal levels in patients with undetectable retroviral load, were increased in parallel to retroviral load, and were associated with low CD8 T lymphocytes and low CD19 B lymphocytes. Normal or even increased levels of DCs and normal or even increased levels of PBL with a Treg or Ts phenotype that coincide with viral load increases and CD8 T- and CD19 B-lymphocyte decreases suggest a functioning immunoregulatory system that reacts to HIV replication. Increased CD8 PBL counts imply immunocompetence. Increased CD8 PBL counts and normal or even upregulated immunoregulatory cells might stabilize our long-term HIV-infected patients with hemophilia clinically."

1113,0.003,3.0,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with marked disturbance of metabolism affecting the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. In the first decade of clinical experience of HIV, the primary clinical manifestation of such disturbed metabolism was wasting. Such wasting was often severe and contributed significantly to the morbidity and mortality of AIDS. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that in addition to the effects of altered intermediary metabolism, reduced food intake played a major role in the causation of AIDS-related wasting. More recently, potent anti-retroviral drugs have dramatically changed the clinical consequences of HIV infection. Wasting has become far less frequent among infected patients and occurs in only a small percentage of subjects on effective anti-retroviral therapy. However, a new constellation of metabolic syndromes has become apparent characterized by altered body fat distribution ('lipodystrophy'), lactic acidosis and evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. The mechanistic basis for such syndromes is currently unclear, but is the subject of ongoing research."
6336,0.003,3.0,"Approximately 15-20% of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus will develop severe neurological disease. This may be due in part to virus-induced release of a number of putative neurotoxins. However, there is little information to predict which individuals will progress to dementia or the precise mechanisms that drive pathogenesis. In an effort to identify early markers of neurological disease progression we used an in vitro bioassay with rat cortical neurons to test for the presence of toxins in CSF from 40 HIV-infected humans with mild, minimal or no neurological disease. A subset of HIV-infected individuals was found to have significant toxic activity in CSF indicating that toxic factors may be circulating prior to the development of dementia. The toxicity was concentration dependent and due to a factor with a molecular mass of less than 30 kDa. Only a small proportion of the cell death appeared to be due to apoptosis. Neuronal toxicity was associated with a gradual accumulation of intracellular calcium in a subset of cortical neurons over a period of 1-2 h and in the absence of a significant acute response. Individuals with both high viral burden and high CSF toxicity were significantly more likely to have neurological symptoms. These initial analyses indicate that toxic factors are present in the CSF of HIV-infected patients that could serve as useful markers of neurological disease progression and provide insights into pathogenic mechanisms in vivo."

Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and RANTES (but not MCP-3), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, or interleukin-8 (IL-8) was higher in HAD. MCP-1 correlated with CSF viral load and severity of dementia, and it increased over time in patients who developed dementia."
909,0.003,3.0,"To determine the frequency of the parasitic pathogens in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients in a developing world setting, 295 stool specimens were examined from 166 HIV-positive patients (49% with AIDS) at São José Hospital, Fortaleza, Brazil, from September 1990 to March 1992. Significantly more patients with diarrhea (85%) than without (66%) had AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) (P < .005). Of the potential parasitic causes of diarrhea, only Cryptosporidium parvum and microsporidia were significantly associated with diarrheal disease. Infections with C. parvum, but not microsporidia, were associated with the rainy season (P < .005). Thus, C. parvum and microsporidia are the most common intestinal parasites associated with diarrhea in an HIV-infected population in Brazil and are associated with advanced HIV disease. The association of C. parvum infections with the rainy season suggests that contaminated water may be important in its transmission; however, the source of human microsporidia requires further investigation."

2272,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) seroprevalence is highly diverse among human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected patients, ranging between 10% of HIV-1 infected homo-bisexuel men, to >92% in patients infected with HIV-1 who acquired HIV-1 through intravenous drug use. Thus, being HCV-free while having acquired HIV-1 via intravenous drug use is a rare situation. Claudin-1 is a protein involved in intracellular tight-junctions and has been identified as a major cellular co-receptor for HCV infection. Our objective was to determine whether Claudin-1 gene (CLDN1) mutations might be involved in natural resistance to HCV infection. We conducted a case-control study. All recruited patients acquired HIV-1 infection via intravenous drug use route before 1995. The case study patients remained free from HCV infection (negative anti-HCV antibodies and HCV-RNA). The control study patients was co-infected with HCV (positive anti-HCV antibodies). Direct genomic sequencing of the CLDN1 gene coding region and adjacent intron/exons junctions was performed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A total of 138 Caucasian patients were enrolled. Twenty-two patients (cases) were free from HCV infection and 116 (controls) were co-infected with HCV. We found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) described previously with no significant differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls. In conclusion, despite being a major cellular co-receptor for HCV entry in vitro, we did not identify any specific substitution in CLDN1 gene coding region in our study patients highly exposed but resistant to HCV infection in vivo. Other cellular co-factors involved in HCV infection should be investigated in this highly-exposed intravenous drug users patients."
138,0.003,3.0,"Microsporidia are increasingly being recognised as important enteric pathogens in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, i.e. acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The aims of this study were to investigate the frequency of detection of microsporidia associated with diarrhoea in patients with advanced HIV disease in the north west of England, and to determine the species involved and their prevalence. During the period from April 1992 to the end of December 1995, chronic diarrhoea in 88 patients in the late stage of HIV disease was investigated. Duodenal biopsies, duodenal aspirates or jejunal biopsies were received from 38 patients, and stool samples from 63 patients, as part of the routine investigation of possible causes of diarrhoea in these patients. Biopsies and aspirates were examined by thin-section electron microscopy (EM), and stool samples were examined by epi-fluorescence microscopy after staining with Calcofluor. Putative stool positives were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. CD4-lymphocyte counts were available from all patients who provided samples. Nine out of 63 patients (14.3%) were found to be excreting microsporidial spores on stool examination. The species was confirmed as Enterocytozoon bieneusi. The mean CD4-lymphocyte count for this group was 37 x 10(6)/L (normal range 517-1677 x 10(6)/L). Three out of 38 biopsy specimens (7.9%) were also found to be infected with this microsporidian. The mean CD4-lymphocyte count for this group was 72 x 10(6)/L. Encephalitozoon intestinalis was not found in any samples examined. The prevalence of microsporidial infection in AIDS patients in the north west of England appears to be similar to that of patients in London, but less than that reported in studies from other developed countries."

This was a retrospective and descriptive study which included 196 adults infected by HIV-1 and treated by a combination containing TDF/FTC/EFV during 29 months in the daily hospital of Bobo Dioulasso. The median duration of follow-up was 7 months IQR [5-14 month]. The median age was 37 years IQR [31-45].With the initiation of treatment ARV, the median of the index of body mass was of 19 IQR [17-22]. The median of the lymphocytes TCD4 was 201/μl IQR [74-298/μl]. During the follow-up, we reported 25 deaths (12.8%). HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load was undetectable in 91.9% of the patients (124/135) at six months of treatment. The majority of the adverse effects of the treatment were of a neurosensory nature (40.5%). The TDF/FTC/EFV combination showed a good effectiveness in the treatment of the infection with HIV-1 in the first intention just as a good clinical tolerance. "
1872,0.003,3.0,"Antiretroviral therapy for HIV may have important economic benefits for patients and their households. We quantified the impact of HIV treatment on employment status among HIV patients in rural South Africa who were enrolled in a public-sector HIV treatment program supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. We linked clinical data from more than 2,000 patients in the treatment program with ten years of longitudinal socioeconomic data from a complete community-based population cohort of more than 30,000 adults residing in the clinical catchment area. We estimated the employment effects of HIV treatment in fixed-effects regressions. Four years after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, employment among HIV patients had recovered to about 90 percent of baseline rates observed in the same patients three to five years before they started treatment. Many patients initiated treatment early enough that they were able to avoid any loss of employment due to HIV. These results represent the first estimates of employment recovery among HIV patients in a general population, relative to the employment levels that these patients had prior to job-threatening HIV illness and the decision to seek care. There are large economic benefits to HIV treatment. For some patients, further gains could be obtained from initiating antiretroviral therapy earlier, prior to HIV-related job loss."

Children with TB were compared to a control group of children admitted for elective surgery. The control group was also compared to a recent census of the background population. The crude odds ratio for HIV infection was 8.6 (95 % CI 2.2-73). After adjustment for possible confounders in a multivariate regression model, the odds ratio for HIV infection in children with TB was found to be 12.7 (95% CI 2.9-55). Of several independent determinants of TB assessed in the study, this association was the strongest. Until HIV transmission has reached its peak, an increasing burden of dual infection among Ethiopian children is to be expected."

Twenty-nine patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, who have received lamivudine for at least 1 year were studied to determine the antiviral response, the rate and pattern of lamivudine-resistant mutations, and the effect of lamivudine-resistant mutations on HBeAg status. The mean duration of treatment was 21 +/- 7 months. Before treatment, core promoter variant was detected in 16 (55%) patients and precore stop codon variant in 18 (62%) patients. Serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was detected by solution hybridization assay in 62%, 4%, and 24% and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in 100%, 31%, and 40% at months 0, 6, and 24, respectively. The cumulative rates of detection of lamivudine-resistant mutations after 1 and 2 years of treatment were 10% and 56%, respectively. In addition to the duration of treatment, core promoter mutation was associated with the selection of lamivudine-resistant mutants. Three patients with lamivudine-resistant mutations had reversion of the precore stop codon mutation; in 2 patients this was accompanied by the reappearance of HBeAg. We found that lamivudine-resistant mutants were detected at similar rates in patients with HBeAg-negative as in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B. Additional changes in other parts of the HBV genome may restore the replication fitness of lamivudine-resistant mutants."
9681,0.003,3.0,"With the rapid progress in the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the observed patterns in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalitis has changed, allowing herpesvirus (HV) infection to be controlled. HAART was first administered to HIV patients in Cuba in 2001. Consequently with the aim of investigate the behavior of the HVs causing neurological disorders in this population in the post-HAART era, the authors perform a clinical evaluation by a multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for simultaneous detection of human HVs--herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The authors studied 241 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) received at the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Laboratory between 2001 and 2005 inclusive. Of the 241 CSF studied, 10.4% resulted positive for HV infections. Of these, 92% of patients were acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) individuals at the C3 stage. CMV (44%), EBV (28%), and dual-HV (16%) infections were the most important agents identified. The principal clinical manifestations were fever, headache, vomiting, and focal abnormalities; the latter being associated with an increased risk of death. A statistically significant result was observed when central nervous system (CNS) disease evolution was compared between patients who were under HAART against those who were not, before they developed encephalitis. It was therefore concluded that it is more likely that HIV individuals receiving HAART have a better recovery of CNS infections than those who are not receiving it."

Malnutrition represents another cause of acquired immunodeficiency and premature death. This evaluation program estimated the impact of family nutritional support during the first year of antiretroviral treatment in West Africa's sub-Sahara region. Family nutritional support was proposed to patients with CD-4 cell count <200 /mm3 and/or developing a WHO stage III/IV or with body mass index <18.5 kg/m2 and receiving antiretroviral treatment. Follow-up of 62 patients receiving support was compared to 118 patients who had only received antiretroviral treatment the year before. Average body mass index, CD-4 cell count were 20.7 and 20.5, 217 and 191/mm3 respectively in supported and control groups (NS). Twenty-two (36%) and 56 (48%) were WHO stage III/IV (NS) respectively in supported and control groups. One patient who received support and twelve controls died (Mortality Ratio=0.19; p<0.05). Increase in CD-4 cell count was around 1.7 times higher (+ 114 vs. + 68 CD-4 cells/mm3 respectively in supported and control groups; p<0.05) and observance was improved in supported group (p<0.005). The evolutions of WHO stage and body mass index were not different but the study period was short. Family nutritional support for persons living with HIV initiating antiretroviral treatment in a developing country showed a positive impact after six months. This family intervention could be integrated into AIDS interventions as an effective and comprehensive community-based primary care."

This study evaluates whether there have been changes in the prevalence of infection by these virus over the last few years within a penitentiary. A group of prisoners (n = 163) studied in 1985 were therefore compared with another group (n = 750) studied in 1992. Demographic, social, risk and penitentiary factors were included. In each of the subjects studied alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hepatitis B virus (HBsAG, antiHBs and antiHBc) and anti-HIV-1 markers were determined. It was globally observed that following the 7 years between the two studies there was a decrease in the prevalence of HBV (X = 14.63, p = 0.0001, OR = 2; CI 95%: 1.38-2.9), which was mainly observed in the group of prisoners with no drug addiction habits. No differences were observed with regard to the prevalence of anti-HIV-1 which remained similar among the IV drug consumers and not consumers (64% and 66.6% in 1985 and 1992, respectively). In conclusion, from 1985 to 1992 a decrease has been observed in the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in the penitentiary population while the prevalence of anti-HIV-1 has remained unchanged."
9428,0.003,3.0,"Human epithelial cells (L132) derived from embryonic lung and human lung fibroblasts (MRC5) were infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or type 2 (HIV-2). Surface CD4 protein was detected on these cells, and recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) blocked infection, indicating that HIV infection was mediated by the cell surface CD4 protein. In contrast, infection of human primary chondrocyte cells (C23), synovial cells (HSA), and foreskin fibroblasts (F13) was apparently independent of cell CD4-mediated mechanisms. Surface CD4 protein could not be detected on these cells, and sCD4 did not block the infection. F13 cells could be infected only by HIV-2, not by HIV-1, under our experimental conditions. In cells of mesenchymal orgin, viral production could be detected only after cocultivation with the human T-lymphoid H9 cells but not by conventional viral assays, including reverse transcriptase and p24 antigen assays in cell culture supernatant and immunofluorescence of host cells. Our DNA transfection studies indicated that this lack of detectable viral production was not due to the inefficient use of the HIV long terminal repeat or the Tat protein in these cells. These mesenchymal and epithelial cells were susceptible to HIV infection but differed in mechanism of virus entry compared with hematopoietic cells such as T lymphocytes. These observations may provide insights into clinical syndromes such as lung dysfunction in HIV-infected newborns and connective tissue disorders in HIV-infected adults."

9061,0.003,3.0,"Evaluation of metabolic factors and elevated γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels as independent predictors of treatment failure in a thoroughly documented cohort of HIV-/HCV-coinfected patients (HIV/HCV). Sixty-four HIV/HCV patients treated with pegylated interferon-α-2a plus ribavirin (PEGIFN + RBV) at the Medical University of Vienna within a prospective trial were included in this study. In addition, 124 patients with HIV/HCV from the AIFA-HIV and AHIVCOS cohorts were included as a validation cohort. Advanced liver fibrosis, GGT elevation, insulin resistance (IR) and low CD4+ nadir were defined as METAVIR F3/F4, GGT levels >1.5× sex-specific upper limit of normal, homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance >2 and CD4+ nadir <350 cells/μL, respectively. HCV-genotype 1/4 (OR26.3; P = 0.006), advanced liver fibrosis (OR20.2; P = 0.009), interleukin 28B rs12979860 non-C/C SNP (OR8.27; P = 0.02) and GGT elevation (OR7.97; P = 0.012) were independent predictors of treatment failure, while both IR (OR3.51; P = 0.106) and low CD4 + nadir (OR2.64; P = 0.263) were not independently associated with treatment failure. A statistically significant correlation between GGT elevation and prior alcohol abuse (r = 0.259; P = 0.039), liver steatosis (r = 0.301; P = 0.034) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (r = -0.256; P = 0.041) was observed. The importance of GGT elevation as an independent predictor of treatment failure was confirmed in a validation cohort (OR2.76; P = 0.026). While GGT elevation emerged as an independent predictor of treatment failure in both the derivation and the validation cohort, no independent associations between metabolic factors and treatment failure were observed. Thus, our findings suggest that GGT elevation is an independent predictor of treatment failure in HIV/HCV that can easily be incorporated into predictive algorithms. "
6783,0.003,3.0,"We used a standardized screening tool to examine frequency of depression and its relation to antiretroviral medication adherence among HIV-infected persons on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV/AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN Study). This is a prospective observational cohort of 700 HIV-infected patients enrolled between March 2004 and June 2006 in four U.S. cities, who completed a confidential audio computer-assisted self-interview [ACASI] with behavioral risk and health-related questions at baseline and 6-month follow-up visits, including the nine-question PRIME-MD depression screener and a validated 3-day antiretroviral adherence question. Among 539 eligible participants receiving HAART, 14% had depression at baseline (22% women, 12% men). In multivariable analysis using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for repeated measurements through 24 months of follow-up, persons who reported depression on a given ACASI were twice as likely to report nonadherence to antiretrovirals on the same ACASI (Odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% CI: 1.15, 3.57] for mild/moderate depression versus none); such persons were also less likely to have HIV viral load<400 copies/mL. Self-administered computerized standardized screening tools can identify at-risk individuals with depression who may benefit from interventions to improve antiretroviral adherence."
9901,0.003,3.0,"An in vitro assay developed as a correlate of vaccine-induced protection from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was validated in populations with relative resistance to HIV-1 as well as in HIV vaccine recipients. Cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were challenged with 10 TCID50 of HIV-1MN or HIV-1BaL, titered in PBMC from normal controls (n=57). PBMC from HIV-1-infected persons with low viremia (n=17), exposed uninfected persons (n=23), and HIV-2-infected Senegalese prostitutes (n=9) were significantly resistant to HIV-1BaL and/or HIV-1MN (P<.001). Among 34 HIV vaccine recipients of live canarypox vector expressing multiple HIV-1 gene products with or without rgp120 booster, PBMC from postvaccination samples were significantly resistant to both strains (P<.001), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor-positive samples were significantly more resistant than were precursor-negative samples (P<.03). This is the first evidence of the induction by vaccination of a validated correlate of protection. This assay should serve as a useful criterion for assessing experimental HIV vaccines before phase III efficacy trials."
8907,0.003,3.0,"In the Mediterranean region almost all patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis are anti-HBV e antigen (anti-HBeAg)-positive and carriers of HBeAg-negative virus mutants. The six members of a family who acquired HBV infection were recently studied: two siblings developed cirrhosis with persistence of HBeAg positivity, whereas their parents and two more siblings cleared the virus. The two cirrhotic patients showed homozygosity for HLA class I by phenotype, which is a rare occurrence in the general population, while the other family members were heterozygous for HLA class I. The sequencing analyses of the entire viral DNAs isolated from both cirrhotic patients showed that the two viral genomes were almost identical and no mutation preventing HbeAg synthesis or viral gene expression was present. These findings might suggest that homozygosity for HLA class I molecules might be responsible for an insufficient response to the virus, favouring chronic outcome of the infection and the long-lasting persistence of HBV populations that produce HBeAg."
1645,0.003,3.0,"Repeated exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does not always result in seroconversion. Modifications in coreceptors for HIV entrance to target cells are one of the factors that block the infection. We studied the frequency of Delta-32 mutation in ccr5 gene in Medellin, Colombia. Two hundred and eighteen individuals distributed in three different groups were analyzed for Delta-32 mutation in ccr5 gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR): 29 HIV seropositive (SP), 39 exposed seronegative (ESN) and 150 individuals as a general population sample (GPS). The frequency of the Delta-32 mutant allele was 3.8% for ESN, 2.7% for GPS and 1.7% for SP. Only one homozygous mutant genotype (Delta-32/Delta-32) was found among the ESN (2.6%). The heterozygous genotype (ccr5/Delta-32) was found in eight GPS (5.3%), in one SP (3.4%) and in one ESN (2.6%). The differences in the allelic and genotypic frequencies among the three groups were not statistically significant. A comparison between the expected and the observed genotypic frequencies showed that these frequencies were significantly different for the ESN group, which indirectly suggests a protective effect of the mutant genotype (Delta-32/Delta-32). Since this mutant genotype explained the resistance of infection in only one of our ESN persons, different mechanisms of protection must be playing a more important role in this population."
644,0.003,3.0,"The nonstructural 5B (NS5B) protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity plays a pivotal role in viral replication. Therefore, monitoring of its naturally occurring mutations is very important for the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines. In the present study, mutations in the partial NS5B gene (492 bp) from 166 quasispecies of 15 genotype-1b (GT) treatment-naïve Korean chronic patients were determined and mutation patterns and frequencies mainly focusing on the T cell epitope regions were evaluated. The mutation frequency within the CD8+ T cell epitopes was significantly higher than those outside the CD8+ T cell epitopes. Of note, the mutation frequency within predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, a particular mutational hotspot in Korean patients was significantly higher than it was in patients from other areas, suggesting distinctive CD4+ T cell-mediated immune pressure against HCV infection in the Korean population. The mutation frequency in the NS5B region was positively correlated with patients with carrier-stage rather than progressive liver disease (chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Furthermore, the mutation frequency in four codons (Q309, A333, V338 and Q355) known to be related to the sustained virological response (SVR) and end-of treatment response (ETR) was also significantly higher in Korean patients than in patients from other areas. In conclusion, a high degree of mutation frequency in the HCV GT-1b NS5B region, particularly in the predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, was found in Korean patients, suggesting the presence of distinctive CD4+ T cell pressure in the Korean population. This provides a likely explanation of why relatively high levels of SVR after a combined therapy of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) in Korean chronic patients with GT-1b infections are observed.

9724,0.003,3.0,"There is limited knowledge about how to treat and interpret results from genotypic resistance assays in HIV-2 infection. Here, genetic variation in HIV-2 pol gene was studied in 20 of 23 known HIV-2 cases in Sweden. Five patients with signs of virological treatment failure were longitudinally studied. Clinical, virological and immunological data were collected and the protease (PR) and first half of the reverse transcriptase (RT) was amplified and directly sequenced from plasma samples. Moderate to extensive genetic evolution was observed in four of the five patients who failed treatment. Some mutations occurred at positions known to confer resistance in HIV-1, but many occurred at other positions in PR and RT. All patients had been treated with zidovudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, but none displayed a mutation at position 215, which is the primary zidovudine resistance site in HIV-1. Instead, a E219D mutation evolved in virus from two patients and a Q151M mutation evolved in two other patients. A M184V mutation indicative of lamivudine resistance was detected in three patients. The virus of one patient who had been treated with ritonavir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir successively acquired nine unusual mutations in the protease gene, most of which are not considered primary or secondary resistance mutations in HIV-1. Our data indicate that the evolutionary pathways that lead to antiretroviral resistance in HIV-2 and HIV-1 exhibit both similarities and differences. Genotypic HIV-2 resistance assays cannot be interpreted using algorithms developed for HIV-1, instead new algorithms specific for HIV-2 have to be developed."
208,0.003,3.0,"Anemia in HIV-infected individuals, still a common hematologic complication in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, is associated with shortened survival, increases in the rate of disease progression, and reduction in quality of life. Based on a thorough review of the literature, guidelines were developed for the assessment, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of anemia in patients with HIV/AIDS by a consensus committee consisting of nurses from academia and clinical practice. A major goal of this committee is to increase awareness within the nursing community of the prevalence of anemia in HIV-infected patients and its impact on their lives. Anemia developed in close to 90% of HIV-infected patients before the introduction of HAART, and it is still found in up to 46% of patients in the HAART era. Another goal is to encourage screening for anemia and the adaptation of a proposed classification system of anemia based on a graded decrease in hemoglobin levels."
279,0.003,3.0,"To assess the possible role of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in containing the spread of human immunodeficiency virus in acutely infected individuals, the temporal evolution of the virus-specific CD8+ lymphocyte response was defined in simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac)-infected rhesus monkeys. A brief period of SIVmac plasma antigenemia was seen 9 to 16 days following intravenous infection with SIVmac, ending as the absolute number of CD8+ peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) increased. In a prospective assessment of the ability of CD8+ lymphocytes of these monkeys to suppress SIVmac replication in autologous PBLs, inhibitory activity was detected as early as 4 days, with a more pronounced effect 12 to 16 days following infection. SIVmac Gag- and Nef-specific CD8+ effector cell activities were demonstrable in PBLs of animals by 2 weeks following virus inoculation. In fact, SIVmac-specific CTL precursors were documented in the PBLs of rhesus monkeys 4 to 6 days after SIVmac infection. These studies indicate that AIDS virus-specific CD8+ CTLs are present in PBLs within days of infection and may play an important role in containing the early spread of virus."
1353,0.003,3.0,"A 29-year-old Ghanaian woman who developed AIDS while being HIV-antibody seronegative was investigated during a collaborative study aimed at the identification of viral causes of a HIV-seronegative AIDS syndrome in West Africa. Plasma was screened with a panel of EIA tests for antibodies to HIV and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Retroviral infection was investigated by detection of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in plasma, viral RNA amplification and quantification, and virus isolation. Positive amplification products were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were carried out. Most EIA tests were unable to demonstrate the presence of anti-HIV anti-bodies, whereas confirmatory assays yielded inconclusive results. Retroviral infection was documented by detection of RT activity, HIV-1-specific genomic amplification and virus isolation. This virus was HIV-1 subtype A with an unusual six amino acid insertion in the gp120 V4 loop and with the nef gene of subtype G. The patient's plasma did not react with either autologous or heterologous viral lysates or HIV-1 peptides, whereas antibodies to other viral antigens were present. In conclusion, the Ghanaian patient exhibited a rare subtype A/G recombinant HIV-1 infection with a near absence of a HIV-specific humoral response. The lack of detectable antibody response might be due to either a highly pathogenic, rapidly fatal, HIV-1 infection preventing the development of the typical humoral immune response or to a host-related dysfunction of the immune system. Direct antigenemia or genomic detection of the virus should be undertaken when clinical or biological data suggests an HIV infection in the absence of serological evidence."
2436,0.003,3.0,"The Vif (virion infectivity factor protein of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) is essential for viral replication in vivo and productive infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, and H9 T-cells. However, the molecular mechanism(s) of Vif remains unknown and needs to be further determined. In this report, we show that, like many other proteins encoded by HIV-1, Vif proteins possess a strong tendency toward self-association. In relatively native conditions, Vif proteins formed multimers in vitro, including dimers, trimers, or tetramers. Through in vivo binding assays such as coimmunoprecipitation and the mammalian two-hybrid system, we also demonstrated that Vif proteins could interact with each other within a cell, indicating that the multimerization of Vif proteins is not simply due to fortuitous aggregation. Further studies indicated that the domain affecting Vif self-association is located at the C terminus of this protein, especially the proline-enriched 151-164 region. Moreover, we found that a Vif mutant with deletion at amino acid 151-164 was unable to rescue the infectivity of vif-defective viruses generated from H9 T-cells, suggesting that the multimerization of Vif proteins could be important for Vif function in the viral life cycle. Our studies identified a new feature of Vif and should accelerate our understanding of its role in HIV-1 pathogenesis."
4394,0.003,3.0,"Serological detection of isolated anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) can occur in various scenarios, but the most clinically relevant situation is occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical relevance of isolated anti-HBc and of OBI with isolated anti-HBc from an unselected hospital population. A total of 14,253 patients referred for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)/anti-HBs testing were classified into either the Health Promotion Center (HPC) group or the patient group. For patients who were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, an anti-HBc test was additionally performed. An HBV DNA real-time PCR test was performed on isolated anti-HBc patients, and their demographic and clinical data were reviewed. The measured prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and OBI in isolated anti-HBc patients was 5.9 % and 4.7 %, respectively. Prevalence was higher in males, elderly people, and the patient group than in females, the younger, and the HPC group, respectively. In most cases, the levels of HBV DNA load were very low (less than 200 IU/mL), and most cases of OBI presented without liver disease or history of HBV infection. The prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and OBI are affected by the methods of detection, subject population, and constituent factors such as sex and age. Although detection of HBV DNA does not always indicate infectivity, highly sensitive standardized HBV DNA tests are needed in clinical settings to exclude the possibility of OBI, especially in the advanced age group."

4759,0.003,3.0,"Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) and treatment engagement (TE) have been shown to significantly predict antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, but no studies have explored the ways and the extent to which similar outcomes might occur when these factors operate together, particularly for people who use drugs (PWUDs). We sought to discover whether TE moderated the effect of NCI on adherence to ART in HIV-infected individuals. One hundred sixteen HIV-infected, methadone-maintained people who reported HIV risk behaviors were enrolled in the study. Variables of interest (NCI, ART adherence, TE) were assessed using audio computer-assisted self-interview. Results revealed a significant interactive effect of NCI and TE on ART adherence, which supported the moderation effect. Findings from post hoc analyses showed that NCI was negatively associated with adherence to ART at low levels of TE. Findings suggest the need to accommodate individual NCI and improve TE as a means to enhance ART adherence in HIV-infected PWUDs."
3940,0.003,3.0,"Neuronal apoptosis within the central nervous system (CNS) is a characteristic feature of AIDS dementia, and it represents a common mechanism of neuronal death induced by neurotoxins (e.g., glutamate) released from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected macrophages (HIV/macrophage-induced neurotoxicity). Neuronal apoptosis may result from activation of the intrinsic (mitochondrial/bcl-2 regulated) or extrinsic (death receptor) pathways, although which pathway predominates in CNS HIV infection is unknown. Apoptosis initiated by the intrinsic pathway is typically blocked by antiapoptosis Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, but whether these can block HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis is unknown. To determine the potential role of the Bcl-2 family in HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis, we developed a unique in vitro model, utilizing the NT2 neuronal cell line, primary astrocytes and macrophages, and primary CNS HIV type 1 (HIV-1) isolates. We validated our model by demonstrating that NT2.N neurons are protected against HIV-infected macrophages by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonists, similar to effects seen in primary neurons. We then established stable NT2.N neuronal lines that overexpress Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (NT2.N/bcl-2 and NT2.N/bcl-xL, respectively) and determined their sensitivity to macrophages infected with primary R5, X4, and R5/X4 HIV-1 isolates. We found that NT2.N/bcl-2 and NT2.N/bcl-xL neurons were resistant to apoptosis induced by either R5, X4, or R5/X4 isolates and that resistance was abrogated by a Bcl-2 antagonist. Thus, the NMDA receptor/bcl-2-regulated apoptotic pathway contributes significantly to HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis, and Bcl-2 family proteins protect neurons against the spectrum of primary HIV-1 isolates. Modulation of bcl-2 gene expression may therefore offer adjunctive neuroprotection against development of AIDS dementia."
3054,0.003,3.0,"HIV-1 gp120 is an immunoglobulin superantigen which can bind to preimmune serum Ig. We hypothesize that levels of such preimmune antibodies vary in the population and might affect host resistance or susceptibility to viral transmission. This study tests two predictions: (a) levels of preimmune anti-gpl20 Igs are a polymorphic trait; and, (b) these levels are correlated with resistance or susceptibility to HIV-1 transmission. The first prediction was confirmed in a longitudinal study of a low-risk seronegative population. In this group, levels of both endogenous anti-gpl20 IgM and IgG varied widely, but were characteristic and stable for each individual. The second prediction was addressed in a study of participants of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, in which men ""susceptible"" and ""resistant"" to HIV infection were identified based on numbers of sexual partners and eventual seroconversion. Specimens consisted of archival sera obtained > 2 yr before seroconversion. Men in the susceptible population (low-risk seroconverters) were distinguished by low levels of anti-gpl20 IgG. We conclude that the level of preimmune anti-gpl20 IgG is a polymorphic population trait, and low levels are a potentially specific and significant factor in homosexual transmission of HIV infection."

The study, from April 2003 to May 2005, with follow-up through 24 mo, was conducted at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Second Xiangya Hospital, Central-South University in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. Twenty-seven HIV1-infected patients received didanosine, stavudine, and nevirapine. Information from case notes regarding age, sex, side effects, viral load, naive and memory T cells, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell count at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo was collected and analyzed. Virologic suppression, defined as an HIV RNA concentration of less than 50 copies/mL at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24, was considered the main outcome measure. Of 27 patients, 17 were men with a mean age 33.5 yr. The mean baseline viral load was 5.15 log copies/mL and the mean CD4(+) cell count was 185 cells/dL. Of 27 patients, 3 patients discontinued study medication; treatment was changed, because of side effects, from didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and nevirapine (NVP) to zidovudine, lamivudine, and NVP for 24 patients who had completed 24 mo of treatment with ddI, d4T, and NVP; and viral load suppression was attained in 17 patients (70.8%) at 12 mo, in 14 patients (58.3%) at 18 mo, and in 13 patients (56.6%) at 24 mo. The CD4 T cell count increased by 114 cells/microL (mean, 299 cells/microL) after 12 mo of treatment and by 132 cells/microL (mean, 317 cells/microL) after 24 mo of treatment. Naive T cells and memory cells also increased in number, but at a slower rate. Activated (CD38(+)) CD8(+) T cells were elevated at baseline (67.7%) and declined by month 24 (49.7%), but did not reach normal levels. We conclude that a regimen of NVP with ddI and d4T provided durable suppression of plasma viral load in HIV-infected patients, with significant improvement in the CD4 cell count, and can be well tolerated by patients with HIV-1 infection."
5072,0.003,3.0,"The Epstein-Barr virus immediate-early gene product BZLF1 transactivates the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR). The BZLF1 gene product caused an 18-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity from an HIV-1 LTR lacZ expression vector, whereas the HIV-1 transactivator tat caused a 44-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity. When cells were transfected with both BZLF1 (pEBV-Z) and tat (pTAT3) expression vectors, as well as HIV-1 LTR lacZ plasmid (pLRON), a 214-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity was observed. This result suggests a synergistic effect of BZLF1 and tat on HIV-1 LTR-directed lacZ gene expression. Analysis of quantitative BZLF1 and tat requirements for maximal HIV-1 LTR activation indicates that BZLF1 does not reduce the amount of tat required for maximal LTR activation, as would be expected if the BZLF1 synergistic effect was due to increased tat gene expression. Thus, coordinate effects of BZLF1 and tat on the HIV-1 LTR or its transcript are probably responsible for synergistic HIV-1 LTR activation."

436,0.003,3.0,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally occurring free radical with many functions. The oxidized form of NO, the nitrosonium ion, reacts with the thiol group of cysteine residues resulting in their modification to S-nitrosothiols. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (HIV-PR) has two cysteine residues that are conserved amongst different viral isolates found in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In an active dimer, these residues are located near the surface of the protease. We have found that treatment of HIV-PR with different NO congeners results in loss of its proteolytic activity and simultaneous formation of S-nitrosothiols. Sodium nitroprusside inhibited HIV-PR up to 70% and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine completely inhibited the protease within 5 min of treatment. The pattern of inhibition by NO donors is comparable to its inhibition by N-acetyl pepstatin. Using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, we identified the modification of HIV-PR by NO as that of S-nitrosation. Our findings point towards a possible role of NO in mediating resistance to HIV-1 infection."
3791,0.003,3.0,"OBJECTIVE. To serially evaluate the viral kinetics of occult hepatitis B virus infection in lymphoma patients and perform a correlation with clinical outcomes. DESIGN. Case series with 1-year follow-up. SETTING. Regional hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS. Consecutive patients who were newly diagnosed to have lymphoma in the hospital between 1 April 2007 and 31 March 2008 were tested for hepatitis B (HB) surface (s) antigen (Ag), anti-HBs antibody (Ab) and anti-HB core (c) Ab. Seropositive occult hepatitis B patients as defined by being negative for HBsAg but positive anti-HBsAb and/or anti-HBcAb without a hepatitis B vaccination history were recruited. Serum HBsAg, anti-HBsAb, anti-HBcAb, hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level, and liver biochemistry were checked at baseline and every 4 weeks during and after chemotherapy until 12 months after the completion of chemotherapy or death. Entecavir was started if patients developed biochemical flare-up of hepatitis B associated with virological rebound. The prevalence and course of hepatitis B virus-related hepatitis, as well as any temporal relationship to viral kinetics and clinical hepatitis, were assessed. RESULTS. Of 47 patients tested, 10 (21%) with lymphoma were seropositive occult hepatitis carriers. Their median baseline hepatitis B virus DNA level was 89 IU/mL (range, <34-807 IU/mL). Virological rebound (as defined by a 10-fold increase in serum hepatitis B virus DNA level from pre-chemotherapy level persisted for 4 weeks) occurred in one of the 10 patients, followed by biochemical reactivation. Whereupon entecavir treatment was started and no liver failure ensued. Regarding the other seropositive occult patients, their serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels fluctuated, but there was no associated biochemical reactivation. CONCLUSION. Detectable baseline serum hepatitis B virus DNA is not uncommon in patients with occult hepatitis B who receive chemotherapy. Transient elevation in serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels does not predict biochemical reactivation, but antiviral treatment might be considered if virological rebound persists."
555,0.003,3.0,"The KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa is experiencing an explosive outbreak of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C infections. Understanding the genetic diversity of C viruses and the biological consequences of this diversity is important for the design of effective control strategies. We analyzed the protease gene, the first 935 nucleotides of reverse transcriptase, and the C2V5 envelope region of a representative set of 72 treatment-naïve patients from KwaZulu-Natal and correlated the results with amino acid signature and resistance patterns. Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple clusters or ""lineages"" of HIV-1 subtype C that segregated with other C viruses from southern Africa. The same pattern was observed for both black and Indian subgroups and for retrospective specimens collected prior to 1990, indicating that multiple sublineages of HIV-1 C have been present in KwaZulu-Natal since the early stages of the epidemic. With the exception of three nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations, no primary resistance mutations were identified. Numerous accessory polymorphisms were present in the protease, but none were located at drug-binding or active sites of the enzyme. One frequent polymorphism, I93L, was located near the protease/reverse transcriptase cleavage site. In the envelope, disruption of the glycosylation motif at the beginning of V3 was associated with the presence of an extra protein kinase C phosphorylation site at codon 11. Many polymorphisms were embedded within cytotoxic T lymphocyte or overlapping cytotoxic T-lymphocyte/T-helper epitopes, as defined for subtype B. This work forms a baseline for future studies aimed at understanding the impact of genetic diversity on vaccine efficacy and on natural susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs."

The objective of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and prevalence of TB-HIV co-infection among patients admitted at Muhimbili National Hospital between August 2008 and July 2009 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Of 387 TB patients included, 117 (30.2%) were in the age group 30-39 years. The overall mean age of patients was 38.1 years (range 8 to 86 years) and 216 (55.8%) were male. Two hundred and five (53%) had pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), 58 (15%) had extra pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) and 124 (32%) had both PTB and EPTB. Common sites of EPTB were pleural cavity 80 (44%), lymph node 31 (17%) and 30 (16.5%) abdomen. Of the 300 TB patients tested for HIV, 175 (58.3%) were HIV-infected and 97 (55.4%) of these were already on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at time of admission. Overall, 104 (26.9%) of the TB patients admitted died. About two thirds of patients who died had PTB. About three quarters (73.1%; N=283) of the patients were discharged home to continue with anti-TB treatment. There was significantly higher proportion of deaths among HIV-infected TB patients (29.1% versus 15.2%) than in the HIV uninfected TB patients (P=0.005). Age was a significant predictor for PTB (OR 0.946, 95% CI 0.917-0.976) while age (OR 1.019, 95% CI 1.002-1.036) and HIV serostatus (OR 2.143, 95% CI 1.313-3.497) were significant risk factors for EPTB. It is concluded that more than half of the patients had PTB and pleural cavity was the most common site of EPTB. TB-HIV co-infected patients had significantly higher mortality than the TB-HIV- uninfected patients. It is recommended to emphasize on the provision of HIV counselling and testing to all TB patients to ensure proper management and timely initiation of ART in TB-HIV co-infected patients in order to improve the outcome and reduce mortality."

6024,0.003,3.0,"The selection of escape mutations has a major impact on immune control of infections with viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Viral evasion of CD8(+) T-cell responses leaves predictable combinations of escape mutations, termed HLA ""footprints."" The most clearly defined footprints are those associated with HLA alleles that are linked with successful control of HIV, such as HLA-B*57. Here we investigated the extent to which HLA footprint sites in HIV type 1 (HIV-1) are associated with viral evolution among and within clades. First, we examined the extent to which amino acid differences between HIV-1 clades share identity with sites of HLA-mediated selection pressure and observed a strong association, in particular with respect to sites of HLA-B selection (P < 10(-6)). Similarly, the sites of amino acid variability within a clade were found to overlap with sites of HLA-selected mutation. Second, we studied the impact of HLA selection on interclade phylogeny. Removing the sites of amino acid variability did not significantly affect clade-specific clustering, reflecting the central role of founder effects in establishing distinct clades. However, HLA footprints may underpin founder strains, and we show that amino acid substitutions between clades alter phylogeny, underlining a potentially substantial role for HLA in driving ongoing viral evolution. Finally, we investigated the impact of HLA selection on within-clade phylogeny and demonstrate that even a single HLA allele footprint can result in significant phylogenetic clustering of sequences. In conclusion, these data highlight the fact that HLA can be a strong selection force for both intra- and interclade HIV evolution at a population level."
6706,0.003,3.0,"The pathophysiology of insulin resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS) is not fully clarified. We investigated 18 men with HALS and 18 HIV-positive males without lipodystrophy (control subjects). Duration and modality of antiretroviral therapy were similar between study groups. A hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp showed an impaired glucose disposal rate (GDR) in HALS patients (5.6 v 8.3 mg glucose/min. kg(FFM), P =.0006). As demonstrated by indirect calorimetry, HALS patients showed an impaired nonoxidative glucose metabolism (NOGM, 2.2 v 4.2, P =.006), whereas levels of basal and insulin-stimulated oxidative glucose metabolism (OGM) (2.4 v 2.3, P =.55, and 3.3 v 4.0, P =.064, respectively) were not significantly different between groups. Despite comparable total fat masses, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans showed that the percentage of limb fat (ie, peripheral-fat-mass/[peripheral-fat-mass + trunk-fat-mass]. 100%) was reduced in HALS patients (36% v 46%, P =.0002). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that percentage of limb fat explained 53% of the variability of GDR and 45% of the variability of NOGM in HALS patients. In HALS patients, leg fat mass correlated positively with NOGM (r =.51, P <.05), whereas abdominal fat mass and NOGM did not correlate (P =.91). Analyzing the relationship between first phase insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, 6 HALS patients compared with none of the control subjects exhibited impaired insulin secretion (P <.05). Our data suggest that fat redistribution independently of antiretroviral therapy is highly related to insulin resistance in HALS patients. Furthermore, in HALS patients, impaired glucose metabolism most likely relates to decreased NOGM and to defects in beta-cell function."
7039,0.003,3.0,"Although perinatal transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is well documented, seroprevalence rates of HIV in populations of women of reproductive age have not yet been reported. To determine the seroprevalence of HIV in childbearing women from a population with a high incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cord blood samples were collected from 602 infants delivered at an inner-city municipal hospital in New York. Demographic and HIV risk factor information was also collected from mothers of these infants. Twelve (2%) of 602 samples (95% confidence interval, 1% to 4%) were positive for HIV on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. In interviews, seven of 12 seropositive women had risk factors as defined by the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta; the remaining five seropositive women had no self-identified risk factors. The HIV seroprevalence rate in our hospital (2.0%) is several times higher than that of many other diseases for which screening is already routine. This serosurvey indicates that HIV infection of inner-city parturients is a significant problem that warrants broadly implemented health strategies. Furthermore, the data also suggest that if risk factor information elicited by physicians is used to initiate HIV antibody counseling and testing of pregnant women, a significant number of seropositive parturients is missed. In areas with significant seroprevalence rates of HIV infection, a broader counseling and testing program may be needed."
9810,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a major global health problem. Recently, combination therapy including HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) has dramatically improved the long-term survival of HIV-infected patients. However, such therapy is associated with a lipodystrophy syndrome characterized by selective loss of sc fat from the face and extremities and, in some patients, accumulation of fat around the neck, dorsocervical region, abdomen, and trunk. Lipodystrophy in HIV-infected patients (LDHIV) is associated with insulin resistance and its metabolic complications such as impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and low serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. PIs appear to be the strongest link to LDHIV; however, fat loss has been reported in some patients taking non-PI antiretroviral drugs. Other factors, such as duration of HIV infection, age, and gender, may also contribute to the risk of development of LDHIV. The molecular basis of LDHIV remains unknown. There is no specific therapy for LDHIV. Avoiding weight gain by reducing energy intake and increasing physical activity may be beneficial in reducing fat accumulation as well as improving metabolic complications. Antihyperglycemic drugs may be used to treat diabetes. Management of dyslipidemia may require lipid-lowering drugs; however, the safety and efficacy of such intervention require further studies. Substitution of PIs with other antiretroviral drugs can mitigate dyslipidemia and glucose intolerance, but whether reversal of lipodystrophy occurs remains unknown. Future research is needed to discover the biochemical and molecular markers of lipodystrophy in HIV patients and develop PIs or other antiretroviral agents that are free of metabolic toxicity."
9124,0.003,3.0,"Nucleos(t)ide analog therapy blocks DNA synthesis by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) reverse transcriptase and can control the infection, but treatment is life-long and has high costs and unpredictable long-term side effects. The profound suppression of HBV by the nucleos(t)ide analogs and their ability to cure some patients indicates that they can push HBV to the brink of extinction. Consequently, more patients could be cured by suppressing HBV replication further using a new drug in combination with the nucleos(t)ide analogs. The HBV ribonuclease H (RNAseH) is a logical drug target because it is the second of only two viral enzymes that are essential for viral replication, but it has not been exploited, primarily because it is very difficult to produce active enzyme. To address this difficulty, we expressed HBV genotype D and H RNAseHs in E. coli and enriched the enzymes by nickel-affinity chromatography. HBV RNAseH activity in the enriched lysates was characterized in preparation for drug screening. Twenty-one candidate HBV RNAseH inhibitors were identified using chemical structure-activity analyses based on inhibitors of the HIV RNAseH and integrase. Twelve anti-RNAseH and anti-integrase compounds inhibited the HBV RNAseH at 10 µM, the best compounds had low micromolar IC(50) values against the RNAseH, and one compound inhibited HBV replication in tissue culture at 10 µM. Recombinant HBV genotype D RNAseH was more sensitive to inhibition than genotype H. This study demonstrates that recombinant HBV RNAseH suitable for low-throughput antiviral drug screening has been produced. The high percentage of compounds developed against the HIV RNAseH and integrase that were active against the HBV RNAseH indicates that the extensive drug design efforts against these HIV enzymes can guide anti-HBV RNAseH drug discovery. Finally, differential inhibition of HBV genotype D and H RNAseHs indicates that viral genetic variability will be a factor during drug development."
1334,0.003,3.0,"Little is known about factors involved in virological response to treatment changes guided by genotyping in patients whose highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) fails. A 12-month observational study was conducted of 45 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, who underwent a new genotype-guided HAART regimen following virological treatment failure. Logistic regression models were used to define factors predictive of virological response to genotype-assisted treatment switches. Virological response was defined as achievement of a level of plasma HIV-1 RNA <1000 copies/mL at the end of the follow-up. Drug-resistance mutations were detected at baseline in 30 patients (66.7%). A sustained virological response to new treatment occurred in 13 (43.3%) of these, as opposed to 11 (73.3%) of the 15 patients harboring drug-susceptible virus at baseline (P=.07). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the number of drug classes where there was resistance at baseline was the only independent predictor of virological failure (P=.0313). Lack of virological response to genotype-guided treatment changes is primarily due to complex baseline resistance patterns. Benefits of antiretroviral resistance testing may be seriously limited by the lack of subsequent treatment options for heavily pretreated patients."

8406,0.003,3.0,"Opportunistic infections (OIs) are common among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients; however, genetic susceptibility to these infections has not been studied. Recent studies have shown that interleukin-8 (IL-8) A/T genotype carriers are more susceptible to a variety of diseases. In this study, we showed the effects of IL-8 gene polymorphisms on OIs and symptoms such as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), tuberculosis (TB), diarrhea, shortness of breath, weight loss, and viral load, in HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients. Genomic DNA was purified from mouthwash samples collected from patients attending HIV centers in the Vhembe district. The IL-8 (-251) A/T locus was genotyped using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The results showed a weak association between the IL-8 AA genotype and OIs such as STDs (P = 0.143), diarrhea (P = 0.906), and TB (P = 0.762). Significant associations were found between the IL-8 AT genotype and weight loss (P = 0.019), shortness of breath (P = 0.043), and skin problems (P = 0.003). Low viral load was also found to be significantly associated with IL-8 AA genotype (P = 0.009). The present study suggests that different IL-8 genotypes are associated with resistance to various OIs. However, further studies using larger samples sizes are needed to confirm this hypothesis."

184,0.003,3.0,"A total of 328 cases of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Western Australia in 1983-1987 was studied with respect to demographic factors, the risk profile, the clinical progression of disease, the utilization of inpatient services and trends in incidence over time. The crude incidence rates were 8.8 cases/100,000 person-years in men and 0.4 cases/100,000 person-years in women. Age-specific rates peaked at 25 to 29 years of age in men. The risk of HIV infection was associated with metropolitan residence, low socioeconomic level, and two specific occupational groups. Homosexual and bisexual men constituted 86% of all cases; the incidence rate of HIV infection in such men was approximately 1000-times higher than was the incidence rate by apparent sexual transmission in heterosexual persons. However, the proportion of cases that occurred in women or that apparently was caused by heterosexual sexual transmission increased from zero in 1983-1984 to 7.5% and 5.4%, respectively, in 1987. After two years of follow-up, 71% of preclinical (category-C) patients had developed signs, symptoms or evidence of immune dysfunction, and 12% of those patients with lymphadenopathy or with other early clinical features of disease (category-B) had progressed to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). At 21 months of follow-up, the survival rate with AIDS was 9%. Patients with AIDS utilized an average of 68.9 short-stay hospital bed-days per person-year, while category-B patients used 11.5 hospital bed-days per person-year. Notifications of HIV infection increased each year from 1983 to 1986, but fell by 22% in 1987. The latter may have been as a result of chance, a screening artefact or a real reduction in the incidence rate."
7208,0.003,3.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-Tat protein has been implicated in the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection. However, its role in modulating astroglial-neuronal relationships is poorly understood. Astrocyte infection with HIV has been associated with rapid progression of dementia. We thus initially transfected astrocytes with HIV proviral DNA and confirmed Tat production in these cells. Subsequently, using stably Tat-producing asytocyte cell lines, we observed that Tat promoted astrocyte survival by causing a prominent antioxidant effect and resistance to cell injury in these cells. Tat was released extracellularly where it could be taken up by other cells. Tat remained functionally active following uptake and caused long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation in lymphocytic and astrocytic cell lines. Tat released from astrocytes caused mitochondrial dysfunction, trimming of neurites, and cell death in neurons. Tat neurotoxicity was attenuated by anti-Tat antibodies, kynurenate or heparan sulfate. The neurotoxic effects of Tat were caused at concentrations lower than that needed to cause LTR transactivation. When Tat-expressing cells were injected into the rat dentate gyrus, Tat was taken up by granule cells and transported along neuronal pathways to the CA3 region where it caused glial cell activation and neurotoxicity. The arginine-rich domain of Tat was essential for both the LTR transactivation and the neurotoxic properties of Tat. Thus HIV-Tat is a potent neurotoxin that may act at distant sites while at the same time it assures its production by preventing cell death in astrocytes where it is produced."
5202,0.003,3.0,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor in the development of chronic hepatitis (CH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The activation‑induced cytidine deaminase (AID)/apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide‑like (APOBEC) family of cytidine deaminases is significant in innate immunity, as it restricts numerous viruses, including HBV, through hypermutation‑dependent and ‑independent mechanisms. It is important to induce covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA degradation by interferon‑α without causing side effects in the infected host cell. Furthermore, organisms possess multiple mechanisms to regulate the expression of AID/APOBECs, control their enzymatic activity and restrict their access to DNA or RNA substrates. Therefore, the AID/APOBECs present promising targets for preventing and treating viral infections. In addition, gene polymorphisms of the AID/APOBEC family may alter host susceptibility to HBV acquisition and CH disease progression. Through G‑to‑A hypermutation, AID/APOBECs also edit HBV DNA and facilitate the mutation of HBV DNA, which may assist the virus to evolve and potentially escape from the immune responses. The AID/APOBEC family and their associated editing patterns may also exert oncogenic activity. Understanding the effects of cytidine deaminases in CH virus-induced hepatocarcinogenesis may aid with developing efficient prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against HCC."

To determine the prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including gonorrhoea, Chlamydia, herpes simplex type 2 and syphilis among FSWs. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 278 FSWs in Shiraz, by using respondent-driven sampling, from June to March 2010. The recruitment chain started with 14 seeds, and FSWs were tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex type 2, gonorrhoea and Chlamydia.

3190,0.003,3.0,"This study aimed to determine the degree of clonal expansion of T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from patients suffering from different clinical types of hepatitis B (HB) infection and to analyse the clinical relevance of the skewed T-cell receptor beta variable (TCRBV). Sera and PBMCs were collected from 90 HB patients. Gene melting spectral pattern (GMSP) analysis was used to determine the distribution and expansion of populations expressing specific TCRBV complementary determined region 3 (CDR3) genes. TCRBV genes associated with monoclonal expansion were sequenced. TCRBV families from the majority of patients (80/90) displayed skewed T-cell expansion. Furthermore, TCRBV11, BV12 and BV13.1 were more frequent than other TCRBV genes; the sequence of TCRBV11 CDR3 was expressed as 'VYNEQ' in all patients and was accompanied by the BJ2.1 fragment. In patients with chronic HB, the frequency of skewed TCRBV was inversely correlated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels. The persistently skewed TCRBV gene families in HB patients may be associated with the development and maintenance of hepatitis. GMSP analysis of TCRBV gene families may be helpful in estimating disease status, and BV11 may be associated with HBV replication in patients with chronic HBV infection."

In 3 of the 28 patients (10.7%), the Q151M complex amino acid substitutions were identified. The three patients had received nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) monotherapy and/or combination regimens with multiple NRTIs for 4.3-8.6 years prior to the study. Recombinant infectious clones generated by incorporating the RT-encoding region of HIV-1 isolated from patients' plasma samples were highly resistant to zidovudine, didanosine and stavudine, while they were moderately resistant to lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TDF-containing regimens reduced HIV-1 viremia in two of the three children carrying the Q151M complex. These data suggest that the Q151M could be prevalent in pediatric patients with long-term NRTI monotherapy and/or dual NRTI regimens and that HAART regimens containing TDF may be meritorious in such patients."

Among the 403 blood donors, 33 (8.2%), 21 (5.2%), and 27 (6.7%) tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or HBV DNA, HCV RNA, and HDV RNA, respectively. Collectively, 55 donors were viremic for one or more of these viruses, and included 54 first-time donors (18.7%) and 1 repeat donor (0.9%) (P < 0.0001). One discrepant case with HBsAg detectable only at MBC was negative for HBsAg, HBV DNA and anti-HBc in this study. Four donors who were HCV-viremic in this study were negative for anti-HCV by the MBC method. Further efforts to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the currently-used tests are urgently required in Mongolia. Three donors who were positive for anti-HBc and anti-HDV but negative for HBsAg, had both HBV DNA and HDV RNA. This suggests that introduction of a new anti-HDV serological test is useful for not only HDV screening but also HBV screening of anti-HBc-positive, HBsAg negative donors, considering a possibility of viral interference by coexisting HDV."

Most cases had acquired infection abroad through blood, blood products or sexual contact. The number of cases is continuously increasing. Fear and ignorance about HIV infection causes panic among health care workers (HCWs) whenever a case is discovered and needs medical care. We assessed the knowledge and attitude of 346 HCWs towards the probability of occupational HIV infection using a self administered questionnaire. The sample included physicians, surgeons, nurses, laboratory technicians and ambulance workers. 72.8% of HCWs believed that they are in ""great"" danger of acquiring AIDS through occupational exposure, whereas 0.6% thought that there was no danger. 67% of HCWs had wrong ideas about transmission of HIV (toilet seats, droplet infection, touching patients). 83.5% mentioned that AIDS patients should be isolated in quarantine. The main source of information about AIDS was the television, radio and ordinary press. 44.8% got their information from textbooks or scientific literature. 95.4% felt the need for more information about infection and disease. The results show an urgent need to start a program of education of HCWs concerning the risk of occupational HIV infection and the measures of its prevention."
7252,0.003,3.0,"Using an anonymous questionnaire to obtain baseline data on sexual behaviour and knowledge of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among students in university residences, the following information was obtained: Knowledge of AIDS was found to be high, although misconceptions regarding transmission of the virus were prevalent. Mosquito bites (15%) and the donating of blood (31%) were incorrectly identified as methods of transmission of the virus. Deep kissing was recognised by only 27% of the students as a possible method of transmission while 22% and 13% of the students, respectively, failed to identify the sharing of razor blades and blood transfusions as possible means of contracting HIV infection. The students' knowledge had not greatly affected sexual behaviour. Two-thirds of the respondents had previously had sexual contact; 38% were sexually active at the time of the study, and of these 74% had engaged in unprotected intercourse with casual partners in the previous 6 months. There was a negative attitude towards condom use and over 80% of sexually active students did not perceive themselves to be at risk of contracting AIDS. Campus Health (82%), State health services (51%), and public advertisements (60%) were preferred sources of AIDS information. Newspapers/magazines (80%) and leaflets (69%) were identified as the preferred media. In reality, significantly fewer students obtained their information from Campus Health (15%; P less than 0.05), State health services (19%, P less than 0.05) and leaflets (44%; P less than 0.05).

Comparison of age-matched cohorts of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and -uninfected children from South Africa demonstrated an association between low CD4 cell counts, low interferon (IFN)-gamma production, and impaired ability to regulate growth of Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin in blood from HIV-infected children.

This study investigated the prevalence and pattern of MHR mutations in North China and the clinical correlations of these mutations. The MHRs of 161 HBsAg-positive patients were amplified using nested PCR, and directly sequenced to identify MHR mutations. It was showed that among the 161 patients infected with HBV genotype C in North China, the overall frequency of MHR mutation was 46.6%. Furthermore, MHR mutations were associated with high white blood cell counts (P = 0.025), high bilirubin levels (P = 0.048), and cirrhosis (P = 0.010). The most frequent mutations in patients with both HBsAg-positive and anti-HBs-positive were located in subregion 1 and 3 of MHR, specifically, residue Q101 (29.9%) and I126 (70.6%), which was different from the mutation pattern found in Western Europe and the United States. Taken together, these data indicated important virological and clinical aspects of HBV evolution in terms of the surface gene of genotype C, which might be important for its response to the currently available HBV vaccine."

Despite calls to address childbearing for PLHA there has been limited attention to developing safe conception programs. This research sought to assess the childbearing desires of PLHA and the experiences of health care providers serving this population. Research entailed a brief cross-sectional client survey given to HIV-infected men and women over age 18 at two Los Angeles County clinics administered over an 8-week period. Focus group discussions were conducted with providers at each clinic site. Although 39% of the 93 clients surveyed reported a desire to have children, two-thirds of clients had not discussed their desires, or methods of safe conception, with providers. Providers reported challenges in providing safe conception services in resource poor settings where clients cannot afford assisted fertility services and in the absence of national, state, or county guidelines for safe conception. They noted complex and varied client circumstances and a critical need for provider training in safe conception. Guidelines that focus on safe conception and harm reduction strategies as well as the legal ramifications of counseling on these practices are needed. HIV providers need training and patients need educational tools and workshops informing them of the risks, challenges, and options available to them and their partners to safely conceive and bear an HIV-negative child."

We sought to determine whether a single acute bout of exercise, similar to what people experience when starting an intensive exercise program, has a detrimental effect on plasma HIV RNA levels. Twenty-five patients with HIV infection performed one 15-min bout of acute exercise. Absolute neutrophil counts, serum creatine phosphokinase, and 72-h urinary 3-methylhistidine (a marker of muscle protein breakdown) were measured before and after the exercise, along with plasma HIV RNA levels. There were increases in neutrophil counts (P < 0.06), serum creatine phosphokinase (P < 0. 01), and urinary 3-methylhistidine (P < 0.01) in response to exercise, indicating a mild acute-phase response with muscle proteolysis. However, mean HIV RNA, which was elevated at baseline in 22 of the 25 subjects (mean of 4 x 10(5) +/- 0.7 x 10(5) copies/ml), did not increase during the week after exercise (P = 0. 12). Small changes in RNA were seen in the three subjects with initially undetectable HIV RNA, but the significance of these changes is unclear. Acute exercise does not have a deleterious effect on HIV replication in adults with high viral loads. Because regular exercise training has not been shown to activate the acute-phase response, the lack of increased viral loads in response to an acute exercise intervention suggests that exercise training is safe in people with HIV infection."

Early treatment results have suggested that lamivudine improves hepatic histology in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and can prevent recurrence of hepatitis B after liver transplantation. It is likely that in the absence of immune clearance to accelerate elimination of infected hepatocytes, inhibitors of virus replication such as lamivudine will need to be administered for a long period to substantially reduce the burden of infected hepatocytes in the liver, and prevent relapse. Histological improvement has been noted in between 38% and 52% of lamivudine-treated patients, exceeding the improvement seen in placebo recipients. Lamivudine has also been assessed in anti-HBe positive, HBV DNA positive patients. Preliminary results show that 65% of lamivudine recipients become HBV DNA negative and have normal serum aminotransferases after a year of treatment. The drug is generally well tolerated with few direct adverse events. Genotypic mutations have been observed in 11% after 1 year of treatment, but this percentage doubles after 2 years of therapy. Loss of susceptibility lamivudine has been found to be due to reverse transcriptase amino acid substitutions. Lamivudine is likely to be reserved for patients with replicative hepatitis B infection with active chronic hepatitis, and/or active cirrhosis. Both HBeAg and anti-HBe positive patients are benefited, as may be patients with cirrhosis."
149,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has infected an estimated 170 million people worldwide, most of whom are chronically infected (60% to 80%). In Italy, the estimate of anti-HCV antibody (Ab) prevalence, in the general population of Northern Italy, is 3.2%; in Central and Southern Italy, it is 8.4% to 22.4%. Highest prevalence of infection (70% to 90%) is found among intravenous drug users. Our purpose is to monitor HCV infection among drug users treated in a Drug Addiction Centre (Ser.T) in Naples and to gain a better understanding of that relationship with the abused substance(s). Epidemiological data are shown for viral coinfections. Finally, the authors investigate access to specific HCV therapy in an Italian Ser.T. The study analyzed a group of 1753 consecutive subjects treated from 1988 to 2008 in the O.U. Ser.T D.S.31 (Gesù e Maria Hospital), ASL Napoli 1 Centre. HCV Abs were detected by enzyme immune assay method and confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay III method. During the entire period, we performed real-time polymerase chain reaction at random for 312 patients. The incidence (per year) of HCV infection showed a rapid spread decrease from 49.5% in 2003 to 14.5% in 2008. The overall prevalence of HCV was 48.1%. We tested 312 randomly selected patients for viral replication. Our study showed active viral replication in 201 (64.4%) patients as follows: 97 of 201 (31.1%) resulted infected by genotype (gt) 1; 3 of 201 (1.0%) gt 2; 84 of 201 (26.9%) gt 3; and 4 of 201 (1.3%) gt 4. Coinfection data showed that HCV Ab prevalence was 58.5% (48 of 82) in hepatitis B virus chronically infected patients. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfection resulted in 95.2% (80 of 84) HIV patients. The prevalence of HIV Abs in HCV-infected patients was 8.99% (80 of 889). Analysis of drug abuse showed high prevalence of opiate addicted, multiabusers, and with high-risk factors. Cocaine abuser prevalence was 14.4%, and incidence, during past 4 years of the study, rose to 42.6%. Alcohol abuser prevalence represented 5.8% of patients and incidence rose to 17.7% in final 4 years of the study. In those opiate addicted, HCV infection was 61.0% (805 of 1320). HCV infection in cocaine-addicted patients was 9.5% (24 of 253). In 78 delta-9-tetra-hydro-cannabinol addicted patients, 5.1% of tests were positive (4 of 78). In alcohol abusers, HCV infection was 9.8% (10 of 102). Access to HCV treatment in our cohort from 2000 to 2008 resulted low (15.4%). Enhancing the Ser.Ts efficiency can result in health and financial benefits."
2321,0.003,3.0,"Pediatric HIV-1 infection presents remarkable features that are distinct from those observed in adult infection. In vertically HIV-1-infected children, the viral load declines more slowly, and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response emerges late, only after the sixth month of life. This response generally tends to be narrow and less intense than that seen in adults. While the nuances of immune response at the cellular level during pediatric HIV-1 infection have been addressed, there is a lack of studies focusing on the consequences of this delayed and narrowed immune response at the population level. To better explore these features, we evaluated the selection regimen in gag, pol and env gene fragments of HIV-1 during pediatric infection. We estimated the number of nonsynonymous substitutions (d(N)) and synonymous substitutions (d(S)) codon-by-codon, using the maximum likelihood method and a modified counting method. Notably, both methods indicated a similar intensity of selection (measure by mean d(N)/d(S) ratio) between children and adults. Additionally, sites under positive selection were equally distributed along HIV genes and the location of these sites was analogous between children and adults. Therefore, the selective regimen in HIV during pediatric infection is equally broad and intense likewise the observed in adults. Unexpectedly, our phylogenetic-based analysis enabled us to identify two regions in the env gene of HIV with distinct adaptive functions. The first region, located in the vicinity of V3 loop, contains sites that might increase viral fitness within-host during antibody attack and virus-cell interaction. The second region, restricted to amino acids 334-368 of Gp160, contains sites that might increase viral fitness during interhost transmission at the population level."
1219,0.003,3.0,"Nonadherence with medical treatment is a critical threat to the health of those living with HIV disease. Unfortunately the search for explanatory factors for nonadherence is still not fully developed, particularly in the area of religion and spirituality. Extant literature suggests that church attendance, religious practices and spiritual beliefs may improve health and generally benefit patients. However, religious beliefs may also play a negative role in treatment adherence due to the stigma attached to HIV disease, particularly in geographical areas and in population subgroups where religious practices are strong. In this exploratory study, HIV-positive individuals (n = 306) in a southern state were surveyed as to their attitudes and beliefs surrounding HIV disease and adherence with medical treatment for the disease. The results indicate that multiple factors influence adherence with treatment and that certain religious practices are positively associated with adherence, but certain religious beliefs are negatively related to adherence. The findings of this study reinforce the importance of remembering and addressing a patient's religious beliefs as a part of medical care."

The purpose of the study was to explore knowledge, fears and follow-up care among Asian Americans chronically infected with hepatitis B. A sample of 154 completed an online survey which included demographic information, follow-up treatment information, and HBV knowledge and fears/concerns. Our findings indicate that there are differences by ethnicity and birthplace among Asian Americans in terms of follow-up care and treatment. In addition, our study indicates that there were substantial knowledge gaps regarding contracting HBV, transmission, and prevention. We found that HBV-infected respondents had many fears about their infection. Three primary concerns were identified: (a) concerns related to liver cancer and overall health, (b) transmission to loved ones, and (c) stigma. Our findings indicate that Asian Americans chronically infected with HBV need more education to manage HBV including information on the importance of follow-up treatment and care and education on preventing transmission, risk for liver cancer, and HBV impact on overall health.

In HIV-infected patients, the management of PAH is challenging given the potential drug interactions between PAH-specific vasodilators and antiretroviral drugs. We describe a 51-year-old female with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-associated PAH. She was treated with the oral endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan while taking a nevirapine (a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor)-based antiretroviral regimen. Due to concerns about potential drug interactions with the antiretroviral therapy, her nevirapine plasma concentration, as well as CD4(+) cell count and viral load, were continuously monitored. We observed no interaction between bosentan and nevirapine during a 4-year period. To our knowledge, this report is the first to demonstrate successful, long-term coadministration of bosentan and a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor."
3587,0.003,3.0,"Quantitative serum antibody to p24 was evaluated as a predictor of risk of vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. HIV-positive mothers, 13 with HIV-infected children and 24 with noninfected children were investigated during pregnancy and at the time of delivery. A statistically significant difference in anti-p24 titers was found between the mothers with infected and those with noninfected children independent of whether antibodies were measured during pregnancy or at the time of delivery. High anti-p24 levels correlated with a low risk of vertical transmission, whereas low anti-p24 titers were associated with an increased risk of vertical transmission. Although the number of CD4+ T-cells was lower and neopterin and beta-2 microglobulin values were higher in the group of mothers with infected children than in the noninfected group, no statistical significance was achieved due to the small sample size."
7413,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection influences natural killer (NK) cell expression of inhibitory NK receptors and activating natural cytotoxicity receptors. It is unknown whether expression of the co-stimulatory NK cell receptor 2B4 (CD244) on NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells are affected by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), low-level viraemia, proviral-DNA or immune activation in HIV-1 infected patients. A total of 101 HAART-treated HIV-1 infected patients with < or = 200 HIV-RNA copies/ml were followed prospectively for 24 months. HIV-RNA was investigated 3-monthly and 2B4 expression on CD3- CD16+ NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells, proviral-DNA and plasma soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor (sTNFr)-II were investigated 6-monthly. For comparison, 2B4 expression was investigated in 20 healthy individuals. The concentration of 2B4+ NK cells was initially reduced in HIV-1 infected patients (P < 0.001) but increased to a normal level during the 24 months' follow-up. The concentration of CD3+ CD8+ 2B4+ cells in HIV-1 infected patients was normal and did not change during follow-up. The relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of 2B4 increased on both NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells during follow-up (both P < 0.001). Higher levels of proviral-DNA carrying cells and plasma sTNFrII were associated with reductions in the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells (all P < 0.05). HIV-RNA had no effect on 2B4 expression on NK cells or CD3+ CD8+ cells. These findings demonstrate that the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells normalizes during long-term HAART in HIV-1 infected patients. The finding that proviral-DNA and sTNFrII were associated negatively with the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells suggests that immune activation in HIV-1 infected patients receiving HAART influences the target cell recognition by NK cells."
6270,0.003,3.0,"Immune complex formation causes underdetection of p24 antigen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Briefly boiling diluted plasma releases all complexed antigen, which can then be measured by some commercial assays. In a retrospective pediatric cohort study, the specificity of this procedure in 390 uninfected samples was 96.9% after initial testing and 100% after neutralization. Sensitivity among 125 postnatal infected samples was, at a detection of 2 pg/mL, 96.0% (97% neutralizable) compared with 47.7% for regular antigen (76% neutralizable), 96% for polymerase chain reaction, and 77% for viral culture. The high sensitivity and specificity of heat-denatured antigen was confirmed by prospectively testing 113 additional samples. Quantitative analysis of samples from infected infants showed low levels of p24 antigen in 29% of cord blood sera, a postnatal increase to levels that were during the first 6 months of life inversely associated with survival, and persistence of antigenemia thereafter independent of clinical status. Prevalence and antigen levels were significantly lower in mothers. The persistent antigenemia in children indicates that their immune systems cannot restrict HIV expression as efficiently as those of adults."

Among the patients listed in the registry, males outnumbered females by 4:1 (septicemia), 9:1 (multiple site infections), 5.6:1 (gastroenteritis), and 2.5:1 (urinary tract infection); among patients not listed, males outnumbered females by 2.7:1 (septicemia), 3:1 (multiple site infections), 1.2:1 (gastroenteritis), and 1.6:1 (urinary tract infection). These results strongly suggest that most nonlisted males with septicemia and multiple site infections, and a minority with gastroenteritis and urinary tract infection, were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive. Among individuals who were HIV-positive, or likely to be so, Salmonella enteritidis was more competent in causing septicemia and less competent in causing gastroenteritis than was Salmonella typhimurium; among HIV-negative individuals, the reverse was true. The different capacities for infection with and invasiveness of S. enteritidis, S. typhimurium, and other Salmonella serotypes in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals and the use of HIV testing for Salmonella-infected individuals are discussed."

8364,0.003,3.0,"Untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections usually lead to death from AIDS, although the rate of the disease progression varies widely among individuals. The cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, which is restricted by highly polymorphic MHC class I alleles, plays a central role in controlling HIV replication. It is now recognized that the antiviral efficacy of CTLs at the single cell level is dependent on their antigen specificity and is important in determining the quality of host response to viruses so that the individual will remain asymptomatic. However, because of the extreme mutational plasticity of HIV, HIV-specific CTL responses are continuously and dynamically changing. In order to rationally design an effective vaccine, the questions as to what constitutes an effective antiviral CTL response and what characterizes a potent antigenic peptide to induce such responses are becoming highlighted as needing to be answered."

Sub-national estimates are not available for most jurisdictions. Hepatitis C surveillance data was adjusted for death, out-migration, under-diagnosis, and undetectable blood RNA, to estimate prevalence in New York City (NYC). The prevalence of hepatitis C infection in adults aged ⩾20 years in NYC is 2·37% (range 1·53-4·90%) or 146 500 cases of hepatitis C. This analysis presents a mechanism for generating prevalence estimates using local surveillance data accounting for biases and difficulty in accessing hard to reach populations. As the cohort of patients with hepatitis C age and require additional medical care, local public health officials will need a method to generate prevalence estimates to allocate resources. This approach can serve as a guideline for generating local estimates using surveillance data that is less resource prohibitive."

Mean age was 35.3 and 35.1 years, respectively. 156 individuals with a mean age of 28.3 years, confirmed as HIV-seronegative, served as controls. There were no significant differences in bleeding on probing, pocket formation or attachment loss among the HIV-seronegative individuals, HIV-seropositive and AIDS patients. We applied multiple logistic regression to calculate odds ratios for presence of periodontal conditions adjusting for age, gender and DMFT. Our odds ratios did not reveal any significant associations between bleeding on probing, pocket formation or attachment loss with regard to lymphocyte and CD4+ T-cell counts among the HIV-infected individuals and AIDS patients. When associations were investigated with regard to HIV-serostatus (HIV-seronegative, HIV-seropositive or AIDS), our adjusted odds ratios were insignificant, too. In fact, most odds ratios were close to 1. Thus, our study supports recent views that the presence, extent and severity of periodontal disease among HIV-infected individuals, may be less that hitherto thought."

The following four patterns emerged: (i) seropositivity for HIV with no immunologic abnormalities; (ii) seropositivity for HIV with a depressed T4/T8 cell ratio; (iii) seropositivity with a depressed T4/T8 cell ratio and T4-cell depletion; and (iv) seropositivity with a depressed T4/T8 cell ratio, T4-cell depletion, and lymphopenia. Ninety-two to 100% of subjects in each of the three groups of patients were found ""to scale"" because the abnormalities occurred in the cumulative, ordered fashion described. This nonrandom occurrence of abnormalities indicates an ordered progression of immunologic abnormalities in individuals infected with HIV, a finding useful in the staging of both symptomatic and asymptomatic HIV-seropositive subjects."

As a result of similar modes of transmission, approximately 30% of HIV-infected individuals are co-infected with HCV. Among intravenous drug users, almost 90% of people infected with HIV are also infected with HCV. Because of treatment with highly active anti-retroviral therapy, HIV-infected individuals have improved survival and are no longer suffering from opportunistic infections and malignancy as in years past. As a result, co-infection with HCV has now become a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Furthermore, liver disease secondary to HCV infection is now the leading cause of hospital deaths in HIV-infected people in the US. HIV infection accelerates the course of HCV-related liver disease and viremia. It is less clear whether HCV infection affects the clinical course of HIV; however, HCV-related liver disease can limit many individuals from receiving anti-HIV therapy.

7144,0.003,3.0,"This article summarizes the current state of antiviral therapy of hepatitis B with special attention given to areas that remain controversial or poorly defined. Strict adherence to liver association practice guidelines may result in missed opportunities to treat patients with significant underlying liver disease. In particular, recommended ALT thresholds may not appropriately reflect disease activity or degree of fibrosis. There is growing evidence that an alternative treatment paradigm for preventing late-stage disease complications may be indicated in highly viremic patients with early life exposure to hepatitis B. Pegylated interferon therapy is often a better choice for young to middle-aged patients with genotype A and B because of the higher rate of HBeAg seroconversion and a greater chance for HBsAg seroconversion in both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients as compared to nucleoside analogs. Nucleoside analog monotherapy is the current standard of care for many patients. However, long-term monotherapy results in resistance to a variable degree and sequential monotherapy may result in multi-drug resistant virus. Which patients would specifically benefit from early combination therapy also remains poorly defined. The rapidity and robustness of the suppression of HBV DNA while on a nucleoside analog should be monitored relatively early during treatment because it affects treatment outcome and the rate of resistance.

These 63 cases and 103 controls with negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) serology were studied in order to analyse the outbreak. The sources of infection were patients who were chronic HBsAg carriers. Infection was transmitted at the time of endomyocardial biopsy, if performed on the same day and in the same room after biopsy of an HBsAg positive patient.

This report updates and expands previous CDC guidelines for HBsAg testing and includes new recommendations for public health evaluation and management for chronically infected persons and their contacts. Routine testing for HBsAg now is recommended for additional populations with HBsAg prevalence of >/=2%: persons born in geographic regions with HBsAg prevalence of >/=2%, men who have sex with men, and injection-drug users.

The aim of the present study was to determine the clinical and laboratory profiles of HIV-infected individuals referred to a clinic for patients with special needs between 2005 and 2012 by retrospectively analyzing their dental records. A total of 97 records of HIV patients referred to the School of Dentistry of Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo - USP, were analyzed. The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine the associations between mean CD4+ counts, mean viral load, and the presence of HIV-related oral lesions (HIV-OL). Most of the patients were male, and their mean age was 38.3 years. Eighty-nine (92%) patients were on regular ART, 77 (79.4%) had a CD4+ count higher than 200 cells/mm3, and 63 (64.9%) had an undetectable viral load. Twenty patients (20.6%) presented with some HIV-OL, including pseudomembranous and/or erythematous candidiasis and angular cheilitis, which were correlated with a low CD4+ count and with an undetectable viral load (p < 0.05). Among the branches of dentistry, periodontics, followed by surgery and restorative dentistry, was the most sought-after specialty, and no intercurrent events were observed during the dental treatment. It may be concluded that there are no restrictions on the dental treatment of patients on regular ART, It is important, though, that the treatment be based on local characteristics and on the prevention of oral diseases.

1010,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) establishes a persistent infection in humans and chimpanzees despite the presence of virus-specific, class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the liver. The data presented here demonstrate that CTLs directed against a conserved epitope in the HCV nonstructural 3 protein persist in the liver of a chronically infected chimpanzee for at least 2 years after infection. However, these CTLs did not recognize the HCV quasi-species present in the plasma of this animal at week 16 postinfection or at later time points. Escape from the CTL response was facilitated by an aspartic acid to glutamic acid (D-->E) substitution at amino acid position 1449 in all HCV genomes that were sequenced. The results of this study strongly support the concept that CTL responses can select for variant viruses with an enhanced ability to persist in a host and have important implications for the design of vaccines against HCV."
1927,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 circulates in vivo as a mixture of heterologous populations (quasispecies). We previously analyzed the quasispecies of the third hypervariable region (V3) in the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 in an infected individual and found that the species with a basic amino acid substitution (lysine for aspartic acid) at a particular position evolved and became a distinct population within a short period, followed by progression to the typical immunodeficiency stage (S. Oka et al., AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 10:271-277, 1994). In the present study, we examined the biological significance of this amino acid substitution by constructing recombinant viruses with specific point mutations and comparing their replication capabilities in different cell types. The results demonstrated that the single basic amino acid substitution was sufficient to render a virus fully capable of replicating in human T-cell lines under certain conditions. With an acidic amino acid at the position, the virus grew much less fast or did not grow at all in the T-cell lines. Viral neutralization assay and peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays further showed that this amino acid substitution resulted in different recognition by several of the serum specimens from human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected individuals and thus could alter the antigenic structure. An additional finding worthy of note was that at the terminal stage, the proviral sequences of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the viral isolates from them were without exception of the late type with the basic amino acid substitution, whereas the early sequence without the substitution was retained as a major subset in the spleen. These results support the notion that basic amino acid substitutions in V3 are a strong predictor of virus tropism and may be relevant to disease progression."
2859,0.003,3.0,"Numerous studies now support that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution is influenced by immune selection pressure, with population studies showing an association between specific HLA alleles and mutations within defined cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes. Here we combine sequence data and functional studies of CD8 T-cell responses to demonstrate that allele-specific immune pressures also select for mutations flanking CD8 epitopes that impair antigen processing. In persons expressing HLA-A3, we demonstrate consistent selection for a mutation in a C-terminal flanking residue of the normally immunodominant Gag KK9 epitope that prevents its processing and presentation, resulting in a rapid decline in the CD8 T-cell response. This single amino acid substitution also lies within a second HLA-A3-restricted epitope, with the mutation directly impairing recognition by CD8 T cells. Transmission of the mutation to subjects expressing HLA-A3 was shown to prevent the induction of normally immunodominant acute-phase responses to both epitopes. However, subsequent in vivo reversion of the mutation was coincident with delayed induction of new CD8 T-cell responses to both epitopes. These data demonstrate that mutations within the flanking region of an HIV-1 epitope can impair recognition by an established CD8 T-cell response and that transmission of these mutations alters the acute-phase CD8(+) T-cell response. Moreover, reversion of these mutations in the absence of the original immune pressure reveals the potential plasticity of immunologically selected evolutionary changes."

In the last few years, marked progress has been achieved in diagnostic methods, knowledge of the natural history of the disease and in therapeutic options, including liver transplantation, which has improved survival in these patients. These advances have been accompanied by an increase in the complexity of decision making. Six treatments have currently been approved for hepatitis B, including two interferon formulations--standard and pegylated--and four neucleos(t)ide analogs, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and telbivudine, as well as two further drugs that are used in patients coinfected with HIV, tenofovir and emtricitabine. However, none of the current treatments is able to eradicate the virus and consequently prolonged treatments are often required with the consequent risk of generating resistance. For this reason, as well as the heterogeneity of the natural history of the disease, there is a lack of consensus on the indications for treatment and the parameters in which treatment should be based, the most suitable drug or drug combination, and the criteria to be used to continue, modify or suspend treatment.

Since the development of the viral load assay in 1988, assessment of HIV-1 plasma viraemia has become an integral part of HIV clinical care; however, the contemporary viral load assay was developed and optimized for clade B HIV-1. Here we report the underquantification of viraemia in an individual infected with clade A virus, and the consequent initial classification of the patient as an HIV controller (HIC). Immunological investigations of interferon (IFN)-γ and lymphoproliferative responses to HIV-1 clade B antigens and peptides, in parallel with mitogenic stimulation, were performed. Subsequent comparison with responses observed within clade B-infected HIC led to viral sequencing, confirmation of infecting clade and recommendation of antiretroviral therapy initiation. We emphasize the growing need for awareness of possible limitations of the commonly used viral load assays, which cannot be relied upon unreservedly in a clinical setting. Furthermore, this case highlights the increasing need for more detailed investigation into both viral genetics and fitness when defining patients as HIC."
608,0.003,3.0,"Studies of cultivatable human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from plasma samples from infected patients have shown a correspondence between increasing viral burden and disease progression, but these measurements are selective and thus nonrepresentative of the in vivo viral load. Quantitation of proviral DNA sequences by the polymerase chain reaction in purified CD4+ T cells has shown a similar relationship but does not provide a measure of viral gene expression. We have studied viral DNA, genomic RNA, and spliced mRNA expression of HIV-1 in infected patients with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Viral RNA expression is detected in all stages of infection. These data show that the natural history of HIV infection is associated with a shift in the balance of viral expression favoring the production of genomic RNA without a preceding period of true viral latency."
820,0.003,3.0,"Mycophenolic acid (MPA) increases the activity of both abacavir (ABC) and didanosine (ddI) in vitro against wild-type and multinucleoside-resistant HIV. We treated 7 patients with diagnosed AIDS who did not respond to eight or more antiretroviral therapies in an open label pilot study with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), ABC, ddI, amprenavir (APV), and ritonavir (RTV), with or without efavirenz (EFV). Therapy was well tolerated despite the patients' advanced disease states. No significant decline in lymphocyte or other blood counts was observed. Median HIV RNA was 5.26 log10 copies/ml at entry, 4.53 log10 copies/ml at 4 weeks, and 5.13 log10 copies/ml at 16 weeks. Median CD4+ count was 34 cells/microl at entry and 39 cells/microl at 16 weeks of therapy. CD4+ counts increased further in five study subjects on extended therapy to 25 weeks (median 27 cells/microl at entry, 66 cells/microl at close), despite loss of virologic suppression in 4 of 5 cases. MPA can induce apoptosis in lymphocytes in vitro. However despite viral rebound, cell surface markers of apoptosis and activation declined in total CD3+ cells and CD3+/CD4+ cells twofold to fourfold in 4 of 5 adherent study subjects at 16 weeks, reaching levels comparable with those found in seronegative donors. Although low-dose MMF appears safe in late-stage HIV disease, this study did not demonstrate virologic efficacy. Higher doses of MMF may be more effective. With careful monitoring of toxicities and pharmacokinetics, MMF deserves further testing in HIV therapy."
2728,0.003,3.0,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are part of the cellular immune response to human persistent virus infections. Measurements of the frequency and specificity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CTL and their variation with time may indicate their relative importance in modulating the progression of HIV-1 infection. We have used limiting dilution analysis (LDA) to derive quantitative estimates of the frequency of HIV-1-specific CTL precursors in a cross-sectional study of 23 patients at different clinical stages of HIV-1 infection and to compare these with the frequency of CTL precursors specific for another persistent virus (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]) in the same patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated in vitro with autologous HIV-1-infected lymphoblasts and assayed for cytotoxicity in 51Cr release assays against autologous and MHC-mismatched lymphoblastoid B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the three HIV-1 structural gene products. The frequency of MHC-restricted precursors was high in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (env-specific CTL precursors up to 73/10(6) PBMC; gag-specific CTL precursors up to 488/10(6) PBMC), although the relative frequency against the different structural gene products varied from patient to patient. The HIV-1-specific CTL precursor frequency was reduced in patients who had more severe (< 400/microliters) CD4+ lymphocyte depletion, while in the majority of such patients the frequency of CTL precursors against EBV was maintained at levels observed in healthy controls. Direct CTL activity in unstimulated PBMC was observed in three of nine patients but no correlation was found between the presence of an activated CTL response and the magnitude of the CTL response detected after stimulation in LDA. Thus, CTL precursors were detected against all three HIV-1 structural gene products in patients with CD4+ lymphocyte counts > 400/microliters, at frequencies that are high compared with those reported for other persistent viruses. A CTL response directed against multiple protein antigens of HIV-1 may protect the patient against epitope variation. The fact that the EBV-specific CTL precursor frequencies were maintained in advanced HIV-1 infection suggests that there may be selective impairment of the HIV-1-specific CTL response associated with disease progression."
1602,0.003,3.0,"The potential contribution of a plasmid DNA construct to vaccine-elicited protective immunity was explored in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque model of AIDS. Making use of soluble major histocompatibility class I/peptide tetramers and peptide-specific killing assays to monitor CD8(+) T-lymphocyte responses to a dominant SIV Gag epitope in genetically selected rhesus monkeys, a codon-optimized SIV gag DNA vaccine construct was shown to elicit a high-frequency SIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. This CTL response was demonstrable in both peripheral blood and lymph node lymphocytes. Following an intravenous challenge with the highly pathogenic viral isolate SIVsm E660, these vaccinated monkeys developed a secondary CTL response that arose with more rapid kinetics and reached a higher frequency than did the postchallenge CTL response in control plasmid-vaccinated monkeys. While peak plasma SIV RNA levels were comparable in the experimentally and control-vaccinated monkeys during the period of primary infection, the gag plasmid DNA-vaccinated monkeys demonstrated better containment of viral replication by 50 days following SIV challenge. These findings indicate that a plasmid DNA vaccine can elicit SIV-specific CTL responses in rhesus monkeys, and this vaccine-elicited immunity can facilitate the generation of secondary CTL responses and control of viral replication following a pathogenic SIV challenge. These observations suggest that plasmid DNA may prove a useful component of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vaccine."

We reviewed the records of all 90 men discharged from the shelter psychiatry program to community housing over a 2-year period. HIV serostatus was recorded for 62 of the 90 men. Of these 62, 12 (19.4%) were positive. There were 28 men whose serostatus was not recorded. Data on the HIV risk behaviors of these 28 men suggested that seroprevalence could have been similarly high among them. The results indicate an urgent need to develop and apply preventive interventions for HIV in this population."

In India, studies during the 1990s showed highly variable anti-HDV prevalence rates among HBV-infected persons; however, data using molecular testing and recent data are not available. We therefore studied the prevalence of HDV infection in HBV-infected patients using tests for anti-HDV and HDV ribonucleic acid (RNA)."
8813,0.003,3.0,"A previous study revealed a high prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA among 249 apparently healthy individuals (mean+/-standard deviation age, 48.4+/-13.9 years; 126 males and 123 females) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. To investigate further the prevalence of HDV infection there, the same serum samples obtained from the cohort were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antibody to HDV (anti-HDV) by a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant hepatitis delta antigen protein expressed in the pupae of silkworm as the antigen probe. Anti-HDV was detected in 42 persons (16.9%), among whom 22 (52.4%) were positive for HBsAg and 20 (47.6%) had detectable HDV RNA. Among 170 persons with anti-HBc in the absence of HBsAg, 20 (11.8%) tested positive for anti-HDV, and 1 of the 20 subjects was positive for HDV RNA. Of note, none of 55 anti-HBc-negative persons had anti-HDV, supporting the specificity of the anti-HDV assay. The optical density (OD) value of anti-HDV was significantly higher among HDV RNA-positive subjects (n=21) than among HDV RNA-negative subjects (n=21) (2.513+/-0.514 vs. 0.836+/-0.550, P<0.0001). The present study confirmed the extremely high prevalence of HDV infection in Mongolia, and identified a person who was positive for both anti-HDV and HDV RNA despite negativity for HBsAg and HBV DNA probably due to viral interference. The anti-HDV assay may be useful for further epidemiological studies on HDV infection in larger cohorts in urban and rural areas of Mongolia, where elucidation of the transmission route of HDV is required urgently."
8427,0.003,3.0,"In Taiwan, injecting drug use has been the main route of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission since 2005, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) also having similar transmission routes. This has now become an important public health issue. The aim of this study is to explore the conditions of HDV infections between injecting drug users (IDUs) with and without HIV infection in Southern Taiwan. In this study, 87 IDUs were enrolled, including 27 anti-HDV seronegative IDUs and 60 anti-HDV seropositive IDUs, and the results of their liver function tests, CD4 cell counts, and anti-HIV and HIV RNA levels were analyzed. The prevalence of anti-HDV seropositivity among hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositive IDUs in this study was 68.9% (60/87). The prevalence rate of anti-HDV seropositive IDUs among anti-HIV seronegative and anti-HIV seropositive cases was 40.0% (12/30) and 84.2% (48/57), respectively. Anti-HIV seropositivity was related to anti-HDV seropositivity (odds ratio = 9.34, 95% confidence interval = 2.67-31.59, p < 0.001). Among IDUs with HIV infection, there was no significant difference in CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA viral load between HBsAg-positive patients with anti-HDV seronegativity and those with anti-HDV seropositivity. In conclusion, the prevalence of HDV infection among IDUs is higher among IDUs with HIV infection. Because anti-HIV seropositivity is significantly related to anti-HDV seropositivity, HDV infection among IDUs is still important. We suggest that for IDUs, HBsAg and anti-HDV should be monitored closely."

Overall, 69% reported having been vaccinated for HAV and 70% reported having been vaccinated for HBV. Multivariate models were used to identify predictors of HAV and HBV vaccination, and younger men, HIV-positive men, and men who had access to a doctor or clinic were more likely to be vaccinated than older men, HIV-negative men, and men without access to a doctor or clinic. Men with health insurance coverage were more likely to have received HBV vaccination than men without coverage. Findings indicate that there is still a significant proportion of unvaccinated men in our sample."
2147,0.003,3.0,"Considerable speculation and a recent publication has suggested that much of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in the subset of the UK population represented by women having babies in Metropolitan London is substantially imported from Africa. Other data are supportive of this hypothesis. Ades et al. (1992) concluded that the fraction of HIV seroprevalence, identified in a large London-based study using neonatal blood from the dried blood spots on Guthrie cards, attributable to mothers born in Africa was 92.4% with 95% CI: 82-100%. This is an important observation which requires confirmation. This paper reports on an attempt to do this with closely similar methodology using the Unlinked Anonymous Survey (UAS) of HIV-1 seroprevalence in pregnant women attending antenatal centres, together with data from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) on the country of origins of mothers delivering in 1991 at the 15 London centres included in the UAS. As in Ades' analysis there appeared to be a strong association between centre prevalences and the proportions of women of African origin delivering at those centres. This was consistent with a high fraction of seroprevalence attributable to such women, but it was also clear that the assumptions required for the estimation of the attributable fractions were not fully met. Analyses modified to justify the assumptions produced attributable fraction estimates ranging from 44% to 96% with lower 95% confidence limits 20% or less.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The ability of pharmacist-provided medication therapy management (MTM) services to increase medication adherence, improve health outcomes, and reduce overall medical costs has been demonstrated in community pharmacies for chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. However, the effectiveness of pharmacist-provided MTM services in HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has not been well studied. In January 2005, a pilot program to evaluate MTM services for patients with HIV/AIDS began in California, allowing 10 HIV/AIDS specialty pharmacies to receive compensation for the MTM services that they provided to HIV/AIDS patients."
6186,0.003,3.0,"To examine the prevalence of drug resistance mutations among treatment-naive HIV/AIDS patients living in Liaoning province in China, the HIV-1 pol gene from plasma of 91 seropositive treatment-naive patients was amplified and sequenced. Three patients (3.3%) had an M46I amino acid substitution in the protease (PR) gene that decreased susceptibility to IDV, RTV, and NFV and one patient (1.1%) had an M184I amino acid substitution in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene that confers high-level resistance to 3TC and FTC. Minor mutations were detected in high frequency in the PR gene. The frequencies of minor mutations to protease inhibitors (PI) were I93L (71.4%), L63P (62.6%), V77I (62.6%), M36I/V (33.0%), A71T/V (22.0%), K20R (6.6%), G16E (6.6%), and L10I (5.5%). The relatedness between subtypes and the frequencies of amino acid substitutions in PR were observed; 63P, 77I, and 71V/T were found in HIV-1 subtype B'/B, 16E, 36I, 20R/I, and 82I in non-B, except for CRF07_BC, 10I in subtype A, and 93L in non-A. Although the primary resistance of HIV-1 to antiretroviral drugs is low among the treatment-naive HIV-1 patients living in Liaoning province, the surveillance and monitoring of drug-resistant HIV-1 should be implemented regularly because of the increased access to antiretroviral therapy in China."
1155,0.003,3.0,"With about 350 million virus carriers, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health problem. HBV is a noncytopathic virus causing persistent infection, but it is still unknown whether host recognition of HBV may activate an innate immune response. We describe that upon infection of primary human liver cells, HBV is recognized by nonparenchymal cells of the liver, mainly by liver macrophages (Kupffer cells), although they are not infected. Within 3 hours, this recognition leads to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and subsequently to the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta), but does not induce an interferon response. The activation of proinflammatory cytokines, however, is transient, and even inhibits responsiveness toward a subsequent challenge. IL-6 released by Kupffer cells after activation of NF-kappaB controls HBV gene expression and replication in hepatocytes at the level of transcription shortly after infection. Upon binding to its receptor complex, IL-6 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases exogenous signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and c-jun N-terminal kinase, which inhibit expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1alpha and HNF 4alpha, two transcription factors essential for HBV gene expression and replication."
7129,0.003,3.0,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-positive individuals are increasingly presenting with non-AIDS-defining cancers such as lung carcinoma. These neoplasms tend to exhibit aggressive clinical behavior and often present with metastatic disease. We present 2 cases of lung carcinoma that manifested initially with cutaneous metastases. Both patients were men (37 and 43 years old) with known AIDS that presented with multiple skin nodules mainly on the trunk (back and shoulder). These cases demonstrate that cutaneous metastases might represent the first sign of an internal HIV-related malignancy. Recognition of skin metastases is important for prompt diagnosis and initiation of proper therapy. With the growing problem of non-AIDS-defining cancers in the current era of HAART, clinicians should be aware that skin lesions in the HIV-infected individual might represent metastatic disease."
4570,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-associated dementia (HAD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by HIV infection and replication in brain tissue. HIV-1-infected monocytes overexpress inflammatory molecules that facilitate their entry into the brain. Prostanoids are lipid mediators of inflammation that result from cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity. Because COX-2 is normally induced during inflammatory processes, the aim of this study was to investigate whether COX-2 expression is up-regulated during monocyte-brain endothelium interactions. In vitro cocultures of HIV-infected macrophages and brain endothelium showed an up-regulation of COX-2 expression by both cell types. This up-regulation occurs via an interleukin-1beta (IL1beta)-dependent mechanism in macrophages and via an IL-1beta-independent mechanism in endothelial cells. Thus, interactions between HIV-infected monocytes and brain endothelium result in COX-2 expression and, as such, might contribute to the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection."

This study examined a new culturally targeted multi-component intervention to address emotional, attitudinal, and social/structural barriers to ART initiation and HIV care. Participants (N = 95) were African American/Black and Latino adults with CD4 < 500 cells/mm(3) not taking ART, randomized 1:1 to intervention or control arms, the latter receiving treatment as usual. Primary endpoints were adherence, evaluated via ART concentrations in hair samples, and HIV viral load suppression. The intervention was feasible and acceptable. Eight months post-baseline, intervention participants tended to be more likely to evidence ""good"" (that is, 7 days/week) adherence (60 vs. 26.7 %; p = 0.087; OR = 3.95), and had lower viral load levels than controls (t(22) = 2.29, p = 0.032; OR = 5.20), both large effect sizes. This highly promising intervention merits further study. "
5217,0.003,3.0,"Denmark is a country with low prevalence and incidence of blood borne viral infections. Among health care workers (HCWs) vaccination for hepatitis B is only offered to high-risk groups. The aims of this cross sectional survey were to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B, -C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among the staff at a Danish University hospital and to correlate this with risk factors for transmission. Additionally, we wanted to examine the current frequency of blood exposure, reporting habits and hepatitis B vaccination status in the staff. Of 1439 eligible hospital staffs included, 960 (67%) were HCWs. The overall human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-, hepatitis C Virus (HCV)- and hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-prevalence was 0% (0/1439), 0.14% (2/1439) and 1.6% (23/1439), respectively. Twenty-three percent of HCWs were vaccinated against HBV. Age, blood transfusion and stay in endemic areas were associated independently to HBV infection as opposed to job-category, duration of employment, HBV vaccination status and blood exposure. Based on a 4-week recall period, the incidence of percutaneous blood exposure was 1.5/person-year. In conclusion the HIV and hepatitis prevalence was low despite frequent blood exposure and the principal risk factors were unrelated to work. Danish HCWs do not seem to be at increased risk of hepatitis B even though universal HBV vaccination has not been implemented."

The sequences were inspected for resistance-associated mutations against PR and RT inhibitors. A total of 140 pol sequences were analyzed, of which 133 (95%) belong to HIV-1 subtype C, five (3.6%) were subtype B, and one each was subtype G and CRF02_AG. Five sequences (3.6%) had resistance-associated mutations. These include three (2.1%) NNRTI mutations.

A retrospective review of 300 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, revealed that 8% had prior zoster, a rate that is sevenfold greater than historic controls of the same age. We prospectively examined forty-eight patients, with no known immunodeficiency or signs of AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC), who presented with zoster localized to the thoracic region. Forty-one patients had known risk factors for AIDS and thirty-five had antibody to the AIDS-associated virus (AAV) at the time of presentation. One seropositive subject had no known risk factors. Absolute lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte OKT4/OKT8 ratios, and lymphocyte mitogen responses were all depressed in subjects with antibody to AAV when compared with seronegative individuals. Seven of thirty-three AAV antibody-positive subjects, who could be followed longitudinally, developed AIDS from 1 to 28 months (mean = 13) after zoster. One antibody-negative subject seroconverted to become AAV seropositive 16 months after zoster and developed Kaposi's sarcoma 1 month later. These eight subjects had persistently low lymphocyte OKT4/OKT8 ratios and elevated beta-2 microglobulin. In patients at risk for AIDS, the occurrence of zoster may be one sign that heralds the marked depression of cellular immunity associated with AIDS or ARC."
10002,0.003,3.0,"There is considerable interest in the potential of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to develop drug resistance, especially as 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (Retrovir) is now in widespread clinical use to treat people with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC). To address this possibility, mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase [deoxynucleoside-triphosphate:DNA deoxynucleotidyltransferase (RNA-directed), EC 2.7.7.49] gene have been introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of cloned constructs in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the recombinant mutant reverse transcriptase from a number of these constructs revealed enzymes that maintained enzyme activity but had a reduced ability to recognize inhibitors such as azidothymidine triphosphate. To assess the infectivity of these mutants, several constructs of proviral HIV clones with mutant reverse transcriptase genes have been made and used to transfect T cells. All five mutants tested have lower infectious potential, suggesting considerable levels of reverse transcriptase activity are required for efficient virus replication. Viable virus recovered from two clones showed decreased sensitivity to the antiviral compound phosphonoformate, thus demonstrating the potential for drug-resistant HIV to replicate. However, although the reverse transcriptase from these mutant viruses showed decreased sensitivity to azidothymidine triphosphate, paradoxically these viruses were hypersensitive to azidothymidine when tested in culture."
3158,0.003,3.0,"A case-control study was undertaken to determine risk factors for lactic acidosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients treated with nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). From May 1996 to June 2000, 9 patients with lactic acidosis (defined as a plasma lactic acid level of >5 mM and plasma pH of <7.38) were identified. Control patients were randomly selected from among a large cohort of patients who initiated a dual NRTI regimen in 1996 or after. Two factors were associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis: first, a creatinine clearance of <70 mL/min before lactic acidosis (OR, 15.8 [range, 3.0-86.5], P<10(-4)), and, second, a low nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count before the inception of NRTI therapy (OR, 8.4 [range, 1.2-infinity], P=.03). The total cumulative exposure to NRTIs was not associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, nor was the cumulative exposure to any of the 4 NRTIs studied. According to these results, monitoring of creatinine clearance, especially in patients with a low nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count, could lead to modifications in antiretroviral therapy in order to diminish the risk of occurrence of lactic acidosis."

HBV is a major health problem worldwide with more than 350 million individuals being chronically infected. HBV is an enveloped DNA virus that replicates by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. HBV genome is optimized, being circular and encoding four overlapping reading frames. Indeed, each nucleotide of the genome takes part in the coding of at least one protein. However, HBV shows some genome variability leading to at least eight different genotypes and recombinant forms. The main drugs used to treat infected patients are nucleos(t)ides analogs (reverse transcriptase inhibitors). Unfortunately, HBV mutants resistant to these drugs may be selected and be responsible for treatment failure. HBVdb contains a collection of computer-annotated sequences based on manually annotated reference genomes.

1215,0.003,3.0,"We analyzed the first 96 patients tested for HIV resistance to antiretroviral therapy in three Brazilian states. The HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) were sequenced by using the ABI ViroSeq system. The drugs previously used for each patient were recorded and correlated with the mutations found in the samples. Viral load (VL) and CD4 count were also recorded. Only one patient had the wild type sequence. The most prevalent mutations were: 184V (59%), 41L (47.9%), 63P (53%), 215Y (50%), 36I (46%), 10I (35%), 67N (42%), 77I (37%), 90M (36%) and 210W (33%). A positive correlation between the number of previously used ARVs and the number of mutations was observed (p<0.05). Associations between mutations and ARV drugs were identified at positions 69, 118, 184 and 215 with previous exposure to NRTI, mutations at positions 98, 100, 103, 181 and 190 with previous NNRTI use and at positions 10, 20, 30, 46, 53, 54, 71, 73, 82, 84, 88 and 90 with previous PI therapy (p<0.05). Previous exposure to ARV drugs was associated with previous genotypic resistance to specific drugs, leading to treatment failure in HIV patients. Genotypic resistance was clearly associated with virological and immunological failure."

From February 20 to March 20, 2009, 300 prisoners over 18 years of age held in Ouagadougou were selected to take part in this descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic data, confinement information (number, motive and prison time), medical history, substance addiction (alcohol, tobacco, drug), and the other risk behaviors (sexual relations, type of partners, sharing of toiletries or razor) were compiled for each prisoner. Serological tests were performed to detect anti-HIV antibodies, Hbs antigen, and anti-treponema antibody. In prisoners presenting signs of tuberculosis, BAAR detection was performed by direct examination of sputum. Men represented 95% of the study population. Median age was of 30.1 +/- 8.9 years (range, 18 and 63). The prevalences of HIV infection, Hbs antigen and positive syphilitic serology were 5%, 27.3% and 5.7% respectively. Four prisoners (1.3%) had bacillary pulmonary tuberculosis. Two prisoners reported homosexual intercourse and 44 reported drug abuse. Sharing of toiletries and razor blades was reported by 18.7% and 20% of the prisoners respectively. Immediate measures are needed reduce the spread of these infections in prisons in Africa."

Clinical and laboratory data indicated that the disease in patients with a recent concomitant HAV/HBV infection was not different from that in patients who had HAV infection superimposed on a chronic HBV carrier or that in age and sex matched patients presenting with an acute viral hepatitis A infection alone. Furthermore, the outcome of the disease was not affected by the HBeAg/anti-HBe status of the hepatitis B positive patient. All patients recovered completely and on follow-up none showed any signs of chronic liver disease. Simultaneous HAV/HBV infection, therefore, does not result in a more severe disease."
6027,0.003,3.0,"In patients co-infected with HIV-1 and GB virus C (GBV-C), the disappearance of GBV-C RNA has been associated with accelerated disease progression. We studied longitudinal GBV-C viral titres in 28 HIV-1/GVB-C co-infected individuals receiving HAART. During HAART, median GBV-C RNA titres increased from 95 to 6000 copies/ml (P < 0.001). In patients interrupting HAART, GBV-C-RNA titres decreased as HIV replication resumed. These findings further support the theory that GBV-C replication could depend on the dynamics of HIV progression."
2403,0.003,3.0,"Polymorphic products of HLA class I genes restrict cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to the constantly evolving spectrum of HIV-1 antigens. Accordingly, homozygosity at class I loci can reduce the repertoire for such HLA-dependent interactions, leading to accelerated disease progression. To test this hypothesis we studied subjects from two distinct HIV/AIDS cohorts: 140 Dutch homosexual men and 202 Rwandan heterosexual women followed up to 13 years from HIV-1 seroconversion. We performed intermediate- and selective high-resolution molecular typing at HLA class I (A, B, and C) and high-resolution typing at HLA class II DRB1 and DQB1. Homozygosity at the HLA-A or -B locus or both was found at increasingly high frequency among individuals with successively more rapid progression to late-stage HIV-1-related conditions. In the combined cohorts (n = 342) the odds ratio (OR) due to HLA-A or -B antigen homozygosity in rapid versus slow progressors was 3.8 (p = 0.003); for Dutch men alone the OR was 3.5 (p = 0.102), and for Rwandan women the OR was 4.1 (p = 0.009). In contrast, homozygous genotypes at either HLA-C, DRB1, or DQB1 alone, or DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes, did not exert any deleterious effect on HIV-1 disease progression. These findings suggest strongly that diversity in addition to sequence specificity at HLA-A and -B loci can influence the rate of disease progression following HIV-1 infection."
8607,0.003,3.0,"A specific 32-nucleotide deletion mutant of the CCR5 gene (Accr5), the coreceptor gene for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), can effectively suppress the transmission and pathogenesis of the virus. Individuals homozygous for the delta ccr5 allele resist primary macrophage-tropic HIV-1 infection, despite multiple high-risk sexual exposures. This gene deletion is relatively common among Caucasians but uncommon among Africans, Asians, and South Americans. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to determine the frequency of the delta ccr5 allele in a Taiwanese population with diverse health status and social backgrounds. Subjects included 24 HIV-1-infected persons in the northern and southern parts of Taiwan; 131 HIV-1 high-risk, licensed female sex workers in the northern part of the island (21% of whom were aborigines); and 187 unrelated, healthy, HIV-1-negative individuals in southern Taiwan. PCR with primers encompassing the entire CCR5 gene was used to explore possible deletions at regions other than the 32-nucleotide area in the female sex workers. No ccr5 deletions were detected, indicating that they are rare or absent in the Taiwanese population. This finding implies that delta ccr5 is not likely to be part of the defense against the spread of HIV-1-infection in Taiwanese."
9245,0.003,3.0,"Campylobacter fetus subspecies fetus has been recognized as a cause of systemic illness in immunocompromised hosts, including relapsing bacteremia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Acquired resistance to quinolone therapy, while reported for a variety of bacteria, including Campylobacter jejuni, has not been previously documented for C. fetus. Two cases of quinolone-resistant C. fetus bacteremia were detected in HIV-infected patients. Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the C. fetus gyrA gene in the 2 resistant isolates demonstrated a G-to-T change that led to an Asp-to-Tyr amino acid substitution at a critical residue frequently associated with quinolone resistance. In addition, comparison of the pre- and posttreatment isolates from 1 patient documented outer membrane protein changes temporally linked with the development of resistance. Relapsing C. fetus infections in quinolone-treated HIV-infected patients may be associated with the acquisition of resistance to these agents, and this resistance may be multifactorial."
3755,0.003,3.0,"High HIV-1 plasma viral loads (PVLs) in sub-Saharan Africa, partly because of high rates of coinfection, may have been one of the drivers of the ""explosive"" epidemics seen in that region. Using a previously published framework of infectiousness and survival, we estimate the excess onward HIV-1 transmission events (secondary infections) resulting from coinfection-induced changes in PVL during asymptomatic HIV-1 infection. For every 100 HIV-infected people, each suffering 1 episode of tuberculosis infection, there are 4.9 (2.7th-97.5th percentile: 0.2-21.5) excess onward HIV-1 transmission events attributable to this coinfection. Other estimates are malaria 0.4 (0.0-2.0), soil-transmitted helminths 3.1 (0.1-14.9), schistosomiasis 8.5 (0.2-38.6), filariasis 13.3 (0.3-89.2), syphilis 0.1 (0.0-1.6), herpes simplex virus 4.0 (0.0-24.2), and gonorrhea 2.1 (0.1-8.0) transmissions. If these higher PVLs confer a shorter life expectancy and higher infectiousness, then their impact on transmission is, in general, reduced. For most HIV-1 coinfections, the duration of a single infection is too short and/or the associated PVL elevation is too modest to contribute substantially to onward HIV-1 transmission. "

Lipid disorders, including lipodystrophy, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia, remain the most commonly reported metabolic disorders among those treated with long-term cART. Mounting evidence suggests an association between drug abuse and poor glycemic control and diabetes complications. Substance related disorders (SRD) may increase the risk of metabolic syndrome."

3435,0.003,3.0,"The human cdc2-related kinase PITALRE is the catalytic component of TAK, the Tat-associated kinase. Previously, we have proposed that TAK is a cellular factor that mediates Tat transactivation function. Here we demonstrate that transient overexpression of PITALRE specifically squelches Tat-1 activation of both a transfected and an integrated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR), suggesting that PITALRE mediates Tat function as a multiprotein complex. A catalytic mutant of PITALRE, D167N, was found to be more efficient than wild-type PITALRE in squelching Tat transactivation. Neither wild-type PITALRE nor D167N was able to squelch transactivation of the human T-cell leukemia type 1 LTR by the Tax protein. Additionally, we show that artificial targeting of PITALRE to a nascent RNA element, in the absence of Tat, activated HIV-1 LTR expression. These results indicate that a PITALRE-containing complex mediates transactivation by Tat and suggest that Tat proteins function by localizing such a PITALRE-containing complex to the site of the transcribing provirus."
3697,0.003,3.0,"The aim of this study was the development of a panel constituted by well-defined HIV-1 strains of different genetic forms, with a particular focus on isolates from acute and recent infections. Fourteen HIV-1 isolates, including four from acute and five from recent infections, were expanded in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. SI phenotype, coreceptors use, and TCID(50)/ml were determined. V3 net charge was calculated. Near full-length genomes were amplified by RT-nested PCR in four overlapping segments. Phylogenetic analyses were performed with neighbor-joining trees and bootscanning. Analysis of cysteine residues, lengths of variable regions, and potential N-linked glycosylation sites in gp120 and gp41 was performed. Viral stocks were produced. Thirteen strains were NSI/R5 and one SI/R5,X4. TCID(50)/ml ranged between 10(4.6) and 10(6). V3 net charge was <+5 in 12 sequences and +5 in two sequences. Near full-length HIV-1 genomes analysis identified viruses of the following genetic forms: eight subtype B, three subtype C, two CRF02_AG, and one subtype G. Cysteine residues that form the V1,V2,V3, and V4 loops were highly conserved. The number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites in gp120 and gp41 ranged between 24-29 and 4-6, respectively. Seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites in gp120 and three in gp41 were conserved. V1, V2, V4, and V5 variable regions exhibited substantial length variation. In addition, an analysis of transmitted and natural resistance to current antiretroviral drugs in these strains was performed. It is worth mentioning that the 13S mutation in the V3 sequence, associated with resistance to maraviroc, was observed in a subtype B strain that harbored resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and to T20. The availability of a panel including strains from acute and recent infections should be a valuable resource for optimizing and standardizing vaccine candidate assessment. Near full-length genome characterization may be necessary for evaluating clade-specific reactivities."

The majority of patients had increased concentrations of soluble CD8, interferon-gamma and neopterin, and various significant correlations existed between them. Our results support the view that enhanced soluble CD8 levels indicate activated CD8+ T cells in patients with HIV infection."

The skin manifestations were diagnosed as leucocytoclastic vasculitis in view of both the clinical appearance and the histological findings. In this study, we demonstrated the presence of IgG-class anti-HCV-antibody, HCV-RNA and IgA-class rheumatoid factor in the cryoprecipitate. These results suggest that the cryoglobulinaemia in this case was caused by aggregation of an immune complex comprised of HCV and anti-HCV antibody with IgA-type-rheumatoid factor, and that this led to a cutaneous vasculitis."
1069,0.003,3.0,"The effects of proton pump inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir and amprenavir (administered as fosamprenavir) were rigorously evaluated in healthy volunteers in two studies, but formal studies in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are lacking. We describe a 65-year-old man with HIV who underwent a 12-hour intensive pharmacokinetic study while receiving esomeprazole with atazanavir-ritonavir and subsequently, an 8-hour study while receiving esomeprazole with fosamprenavir-ritonavir. Consistent with the data in healthy volunteers, a major interaction between esomeprazole and atazanavir-ritonavir was observed in this patient-marked reductions in atazanavir trough plasma concentration and in the area under the concentration-time curve from 0-24 hours-whereas an interaction between esomeprazole and fosamprenavir-ritonavir was not apparent in this patient."
7239,0.003,3.0,"We describe a 44-year-old male patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and pulmonary arterial hypertension who was treated with several protease inhibitors and with sildenafil. In order to guide treatment with sildenafil, the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of sildenafil were monitored at various time points. In comparison with healthy subjects, the maximal concentration in plasma (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), and elimination half-life of sildenafil were approximately doubled in the patient. After increasing the sildenafil dose to ensure therapeutic drug levels over 24 hours, the pulmonary arterial hypertension and physical performance of the patient improved significantly. We conclude that the elimination of sildenafil is impaired in patients treated with protease inhibitors, but to a lesser extent than predicted from single-dose studies reported in the literature. Patients treated concomitantly with protease inhibitors and sildenafil need close monitoring of plasma levels, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity of sildenafil in order to be treated optimally."
5218,0.003,3.0,"Liver transplantation of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients has been associated with high morbidity and mortality secondary to hepatitis B (HB) recurrence in the graft. Eight patients of the Queensland Liver Transplant Service were HBsAg positive pretransplant. Six acquired HB infection of the graft, one developed serological recurrence of HB before early death from sepsis, and one HB e antigen-negative patient permanently cleared the virus. HB-infected grafts showed early expression of viral antigen, acute hepatitis, fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or minimal changes associated with a carrier state. Only in the latter case was HB mild and nonprogressive. Cases of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis progressed rapidly to liver failure; they showed fibrosis and plates of ductular epithelium extending from portal tracts into lobules, cholestasis, ballooning of hepatocytes, and prominent hepatocyte expression of viral antigens. Perioperative HB immunoglobulin proved ineffective in preventing HB recurrence. One other patient became HBsAg positive for the first time after retransplantation; he developed severe acute hepatitis, then chronic active hepatitis. Our biopsy findings support the view that, in liver allografts, the HB virus may be directly cytopathic."
4194,0.003,3.0,"Rare human immunodeficiency virus 1-infected individuals, termed elite suppressors (ES), maintain plasma virus levels of <50 copies/ml and normal CD4 counts without therapy. The major histocompatibility complex class I allele group human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*57 is overrepresented in this population. Mutations in HLA-B*57-restricted epitopes have been observed in ES, but their significance has remained unclear. Here we investigate the extent and impact of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations in HLA-B*57+ ES. We provide the first direct evidence that most ES experience chronic low level viremia. Sequencing revealed a striking discordance between the genotypes of plasma virus and archived provirus in resting CD4+ T cells. Mutations in HLA-B*57-restricted Gag epitopes were present in all viruses from plasma but were rare in proviruses, suggesting powerful selective pressure acting at these epitopes. Surprisingly, strong CD8+ T cell interferon-gamma responses were detected against some mutant epitopes found in plasma virus, suggesting the development of de novo responses to viral variants. In some individuals, relative CD8+ T cell interleukin-2 responses showed better correlation with the selection observed in vivo. Thus, analysis of low level viremia reveals an unexpectedly high level of CTL escape mutations reflecting selective pressure acting at HLA-B*57-restricted epitopes in ES. Continued viral suppression probably reflects CTL responses against unmutated epitopes and residual or de novo responses against epitopes with escape mutations."
4569,0.003,3.0,"CD4-positive membrane vesicles (MV) were isolated under isotonic conditions from human T lymphoblastoid cells MT-2 and CEM and tested for their ability to support reverse transcription of viral RNA upon exposure to human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1). MV contained cytoplasms as confirmed by the presence of mitochondrial DNA but were devoid of chromosomal DNA. Virus binding and vesicle lysis assays revealed that 4-19% (depending upon virus dose) of MV-bound HIV-1 entered the vesicles. HIV-1 internalized in MV was able to initiate and complete viral DNA synthesis as determined by the detection of products of reverse transcription using polymerase chain reaction amplification of viral DNA using regions present in early (strong stop) transcripts and full-length double-stranded molecules. Viral DNA was undetectable in MV exposed to HIV-1 at 0 degrees C, in MV exposed to UV-inactivated virus at 37 degrees C, or after exposure to intact virus at 37 degrees C in the presence of reverse transcriptase inhibitors 2',3'-dideoxycytidine and a tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk](1,4)-benzodiazepin-2-(1H)-thione derivative, indicating that viral DNA detected in HIV-1-exposed MV was synthesized de novo. Kinetic studies revealed that HIV-1 DNA synthesis in MV was very rapid; full-length viral DNA was detected within 15 min of exposure at 37 degrees C, and the DNA levels increased 90-fold after 1 h and declined thereafter. Strong stop viral DNA was 10-fold more abundant than full-length DNA after 1 h at 37 degrees C, indicating that 10% of input viral genomes are fully transcribed in MV within this time frame. This system preserves the critical features of intact CD4-bearing cells to permit studies of HIV-1 entry, uncoating, and reverse transcription of viral RNA."

In this article, the authors provide a brief overview of the most common psychiatric complications associated with HIV infection and discuss the role of dopamine as a link between psychiatric manifestations and the progression of immunodeficiency infection."
572,0.003,3.0,"Virus variants escaping from host immunity may be implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In this cross-sectional study, the association was evaluated of the frequency of amino acid variation within the immunogenic epitopes of surface gene with different disease stages of chronic HBV infection. The surface gene of HBV encompassing the a determinant (amino acids 124-148) and the putative HLA class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope (amino acids 28- 51) were amplified and directly sequenced in 33 asymptomatic carriers (Group I), 31 patients with chronic hepatitis (Group II), 22 with cirrhosis (Group III), and 36 with hepatocellular carcinoma (Group IV). The amino acid sequences were compared subsequently with the consensus sequences of HBV serotype adw or adr. The frequency of amino acid variation per site per sequence (FEQ) was analyzed by generalized estimating equation with Poisson model after stratification by clinical and virological features. The FEQ was 1.21% overall, and was highest in Group IV patients and in patients above 50 years of age. In contrast, nine Group IV patients aged below 50 years who were infected with serotype adw had an inversely higher FEQ than those above 50; the age effect among hepatocellular carcinoma patients was significantly different from that among non-cancerous patients (P = 0.04). Variation of amino acid clustered within a determinant and CTL epitope for serotype adw but was distributed at random for serotype adr. Mutation hotspots differed between serotypes adw and adr. The FEQ of HBV surface protein is correlated positively with advancing age and severity of liver disease, and certain variants may contribute to the persistence of HBV infection."
2577,0.003,3.0,"As a result of the potent drug combinations of reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors currently available, it is now possible to achieve extreme reductions in the numbers of viral particles in the peripheral blood of HIV-positive patients undergoing treatment, to the point that they are undetectable. Moreover, the immunological recovery resulting from continued and prolonged use of these drugs significantly reduces both mortality and the incidence of opportunistic infections. However, the strict therapeutic regimens required, the number of pills, adverse events and the stigma of a disease that requires the patient to introduce pill-taking into his/her lifestyle brings into question one aspect of mental health, which is motivation to do that which is being proposed. We investigated the influence of each of the components of the adherence trilogy: information, motivation and behavioral abilities, as risk factors in a population of HIV-positive/AIDS patients undergoing antiretroviral treatment in the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil."
8947,0.003,3.0,"The HIV susceptibility and resistance alleles in the HLA genes were determined by investigating the distribution characteristics of the HLA alleles (A, B, and DRB1) in HIV-infected individuals of the Han population in Hubei, and by comparing these alleles with HIV-negative individuals from the same area. A cohort of 424 HIV-1 infected individuals were chosen as study subjects, and 836 HIV-negative healthy subjects from the same area served as the control population. HLA-A, B, and DRB1 allele typing was performed using polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP) and polymerase chain reaction-sequencing based typing (PCR-SBT) techniques. Arlequin ver3.0 was used to analyze the allele and haplotype frequencies of HLA-A, B, and DRB 1, whereas Epi Info 7 and SPSS18.0 was used to analyze the differences in the HLA alleles between the HIV-1 positive and HIV-1 negative groups. A*02:03, DRB1*01:01, and DRB1*15:01 alleles and their haplotypes as well as the HLA_Bw4-Bw6 hybrid showed a protective effect on HIV-1 infection. After adjusting for confounding factors such as age and sex, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that B*15:02G, DRB1*01:01, and DRB1*15:01 subtypes were the resistance genes of HIV-1 infection, while B*13:01 might increase susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. The correlation between A*02:06 and B*15:01G subtypes and HIV-1 susceptibility was independent of the age and sex of the host. This study demonstrated the influence of genetic factors in humans such as HLA polymorphism on individuals to resist HIV-1 infection. Association studies of HLA polymorphism, susceptibility/resistance to HIV-1 infection, and hosts' genetic background are of significant importance for research on HIV-1 pathogenesis and vaccine design."

We found a novel GPGGMI motif in the V3 loop, a novel insertion of a proline in the C3 region, and persistent deletion of two amino acids in the vif gene. The patient had been treated with HAART after diagnosis. Forty months after the first amplification of HIV-1 DNA, anti-HIV-1 antibody was confirmed by ELISA and Western blot and, thus, we amplified and sequenced HIV-1 full sequences. Interestingly, the sequence at the TATAA box was TAAAA, although full sequences were not CRF01_AE. The major differences in the level of the HIV-1 gene between the seronegative and seropositive states were changes at the glycosylation site (NXT) next to the inserted proline and many resistance mutations including M184V to antiretroviral drugs occurred. This is the first report on HIV-1 full sequences isolated from seronegative AIDS patients infected with subtype B in Korea."
3865,0.003,3.0,"A major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is hepatitis B virus (HBV), whose pathogenesis is exacerbated by the acquisition of mutations that accelerate carcinogenesis. We examined, with mass spectrometry, the temporality of an HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) double mutation in plasma and tumors. Initial studies found that 52 of 70 (74.3%) tumors from patients residing in Qidong, People's Republic of China, contained this HBV mutation. Paired plasma samples were available for six of the tumor specimens; four tumors had the HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) mutation, whereas three of the paired plasma samples were also positive. The potential predictive value of this biomarker was explored by using stored plasma samples from a study of 120 residents of Qidong who had been monitored for aflatoxin exposure and HBV infection. After 10 years of passive follow-up, there were six cases of major liver disease including HCC (four cases), hepatitis (one case), and cirrhosis (one case). All six cases had detectable levels of the HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) mutation up to 8 years before diagnosis. Finally, 15 liver cancers were selected from a prospective cohort of 1,638 high-risk individuals in Qidong on the basis of available plasma samples spanning the years before and after diagnosis. The HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) mutation was detected in 8 of the 15 cases (53.3%) before cancer. The persistence of detection of this mutation was statistically significant (P = 0.022, two-tailed). We therefore found that a prediagnosis biomarker of specific HBV mutations can be measured in plasma and suggest this marker for use as an intermediate endpoint in prevention and intervention trials."

The study also investigated which patients do not receive guideline treatment. We used a retrospective cross-sectional study design using medical and pharmacy claims data. Data from 1,791 HIV-infected patients using antiretroviral agents between 1 February 1998 and 31 July 1999, including demographic characteristics, medication guideline use, medication adherence and cost of care, were examined. Factors associated with total health care costs and time-to-inpatient admission (as a proxy for patient outcomes) were assessed. Patients receiving guideline (HAART) therapy (55%) had higher prescription and total health care costs but lower medical costs. Patients not receiving treatment according to guidelines were more likely to be female, older, have comorbidities, lower medication adherence and no AIDS-defining illness. Treatment with HAART guidelines was associated with longer time-to-inpatient admission controlling for other factors. In a short-term cross-sectional analysis, patients treated with HAART guidelines had better outcomes based on time-to-inpatient admission but higher prescription and total health care costs. Some patients are at risk for not receiving care according to national treatment guidelines and may be targeted for intervention programmes."
1509,0.003,3.0,"Several recent studies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients have identified micronutrient deficiencies as affecting progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and death. Although the mechanisms are not known, micronutrient deficiencies may exacerbate the oxidative stress induced by HIV. In addition, infection and its evolution likely lead to an increased requirement for nutritional micronutrients, especially antioxidants. To evaluate this, 40 relatively healthy, institutionalized HIV-infected individuals were recruited for assessment before or three months after fresh fruit and vegetable supply were increased due to seasonal supply. Seven-day dietary records were recorded at the beginning (December) and end of the three-month study period (March). Oxidative stress indices and CD4+, CD38+/CD8+, and CD95+ T-lymphocyte subsets were also measured at these times. No significant differences were found in calorie or protein intake across the study period, but vitamin A, C, and E intakes all increased. A number of redox indicators were modified (increase: total antioxidant status, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione; and decrease: superoxide dismutase) during the study period. However, no change in malondialdehyde, hydroperoxides, or DNA damage was noted but a significant reduction in CD38+/CD8+ relative count was seen. Within the context and limitations of this study, the increase of dietary fruits and vegetables intake for three months had some beneficial effects on nutrition, systemic redox balance, and immune parameters in HIV-infected persons."

We searched for articles on medline using the terms, ""Hepatitis C"", ""Prevalence"", ""Epidemiology"", ""Africa"" and ""Treatment"". The bibliographies of the articles found were used to find other references. We included articles published after 1995 only. The data was summarized and presented in tables and figures. Africa has the highest WHO estimated regional HCV prevalence (5.3%). Egypt has the highest prevalence (17.5%) of HCV in the world. Genotypes commonly found in Africa are 1, 4 and 5. Genotype 3 is found in Egypt and parts of Central Africa. Blood transfusion is a major means of acquisition of HCV infection. While treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin is recommended for patients with chronic HCV, no data were found on their use in Africa. Neither were there any data on definitive management (liver transplantation) for those with end stage disease. Data on HCV infection in Africa are scarce. This suggests that hepatitis C is still a neglected disease in many countries. Limited data exist in literature on HCV in Africa."
1697,0.003,3.0,"The feasibility of using a trans-dominant interfering human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope mutant for inducible gene therapy of HIV infection was investigated. Genes encoding wild-type or mutant glycoproteins were introduced into CD4+ cells, where they were stably maintained but not expressed until induced. Envelope (env) gene expression was dependent upon the viral regulatory protein Tat. Induction of the mutant env resulted in resistance to cytopathic effects mediated by wild-type envelope and decreased infectious vector virus production. When cells containing the mutant env gene were infected with wild-type virus, viral spread was inhibited. The fact that maintenance of the env gene was stable over time suggests that inducible gene therapy using the dominantly interfering env mutant may be a feasible approach to slowing the progression of HIV-1 disease."
2085,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an in-frame stop codon within the pre-core region of the virus genome caused fulminant hepatitis in two individuals. Serum from a chronically infected patient who was the source of the virus was inoculated into three chimpanzees at dilutions of 10(-1), 10(-3), and 10(-7). All three chimpanzees developed acute hepatitis B with relatively high peak values of liver enzymes in their serum. The complete nucleotide sequence of virus DNA recovered from the chimpanzee serum by enzymatic amplification was identical with that from the human serum. By comparing the sequence of this strain (HT) with that of 32 published HBV genomes, changes in nucleotides and predicted amino acids that were rarely or never found in other HBV isolates were identified. Thirteen such nucleotides were found within the cis-acting regulatory elements, of which 6 were within the enhancer II-core promoter region. Twenty-four rare or unique changes in amino acids were found in open reading frames, of which 15 occurred in the region that spanned the 3' half of the X gene, through the pre-core/core gene, to the 5' end of the polymerase gene. Thus, an HBV pre-core stop mutant implicated in fulminant hepatitis is highly infectious, induces severe hepatitis in chimpanzees, and possesses significant genetic variation from reported HBV isolates."

Moreover, HIV infection is associated with accelerated coronary atherosclerosis and vasculopathy, although the mechanisms underlying these findings have not been determined. We describe the case of a 45-year-old woman with HIV/HCV coinfection, irritable bowel syndrome, and accelerated progression of coronary atherosclerosis after execution of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this case, the rapidity of progression of atherosclerosis seems linked principally to chronic inflammation and excess immune activation that can depend by a concourse of factors (chronic C hepatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, PCI execution) not directly associated with traditional risk factors. Caregivers following HIV-infected patients should be aware of the increased risk of accelerated atherogenesis in these subjects, principally in case of presence of causes of intense immune activation."
9298,0.003,3.0,"Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common because of their shared modes of transmission. HIV infection alters the natural history of HBV infection, leading to more severe liver disease, decreased hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, and higher HBV DNA levels. Furthermore, end-stage liver disease has emerged as a common cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected persons receiving HAART. For these reasons, it is important to vaccinate susceptible persons against HBV infection and to diagnose and treat chronic hepatitis B in HIV-infected persons. The treatment plan for chronic hepatitis B needs to be individualized based on the stage of both viral infections and the available options. It is anticipated that we are entering a period of combination therapy for chronic hepatitis B, but the ideal combination needs to be elucidated."
3857,0.003,3.0,"The evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) env gp120 region was addressed in HIV-1 infected children showing virological failure to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Sequence analysis of the replicating plasma virus at baseline and after one year of therapy documented evolution of gp120 in all subjects but one. Analysis of the host's selective pressure showed that the values of Ka/Ks ratios were higher in the V3 sequence than in the whole C2-V5 region in 4 of 5 children with improvement of thymic output. Moreover, in 2 of the 4 chidren, the V3 evolution paralleled with a reverse shift of the viral phenotype (from CXCR4-tropic to CCR5-tropic). These results suggest that, under ART, the V3 evolution towards less pathogenic viral variants may be driven by the host's increased selective pressure following restoration of thymic function and immune reconstitution."
8910,0.003,3.0,"We examined consecutive protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected individuals, to distinguish changes resulting from sequence evolution due to possible superinfection. Between July 1997 and December 2001, >/=2 PR and RT samples from 718 persons were sequenced at Stanford University Hospital. Thirty-seven persons had highly divergent sequence pairs characterized by a nucleotide distance of >4.5% in PR or >3.0% in RT. In 16 of 37 sequence pairs, divergence resulted from the loss of mutations during a treatment interruption or from the gain of mutations with reinstitution of treatment. tat and/or gag sequencing of HIV-1 from cryopreserved plasma samples could be performed on 15 of the 21 divergent isolate pairs from persons without a treatment interruption. The sequences of these genes, unaffected by selective drug pressure, were monophyletic. Although HIV-1 PR and RT genes from treated persons may become highly divergent, these changes usually are the result of sequence evolution, rather than superinfection."
4079,0.003,3.0,"There are 3 groups of drugs available for the treatment of patients with HIV disease. These are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ('nucleoside analogues') [zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, lamivudine and abacavir]; the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz); and the protease inhibitors (saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and amprenavir). The preferred initial regimen should reduce and maintain plasma HIV RNA below the level of detection. Presently, the regimen of choice consists of 2 nucleoside analogues plus a protease inhibitor with high in vivo efficacy. An alternative combination consists of 2 nucleoside analogues plus a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Drug interactions are one of the major problems associated with these multidrug regimens. Changes in plasma concentrations of the nucleoside analogues are unlikely to be of clinical relevance as drug effect is mainly dependent on the rate and extent of intracellular phosphorylation. Combinations of zidovudine plus stavudine, and probably zalcitabine plus lamivudine, should be avoided as competition for phosphorylating enzymes may occur. The antiviral efficacy of some nucleoside analogues, e.g. stavudine, may be compromised by prior treatment with other nucleosides (e.g. zidovudine). However, these data need to be clarified in further studies. It is unlikely that administration of other antiretrovirals will influence the activity of nucleoside analogues. Protease inhibitors are metabolised by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Combination protease inhibitor therapy can result in drug interactions mediated by enzyme inhibition. Ritonavir is the most potent inhibitor, saquinavir the least. The protease inhibitors also interact with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Nevirapine and efavirenz induce drug metabolising enzymes and may reduce plasma concentrations of protease inhibitors. A study in healthy volunteers showed that nelfinavir concentrations are increased by combination with efavirenz. Delavirdine inhibits drug metabolising enzymes and increases the plasma concentration of coadministered protease inhibitors. The nucleoside analogues would not be expected to interact with the protease inhibitors. Apart from the ability of didanosine to reduce the area under the concentration-time curve of delavirdine, there are no reports of clinically significant interactions of other antiretrovirals with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Triple therapy is the current standard of care for patients with HIV disease. However, studies of quadruple therapy are already under way. Drug interactions are likely to remain one of the major considerations when selecting a therapeutic regimen for patients with HIV."
4233,0.003,3.0,"In order to assess the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance mutation profiles and evaluate the distribution of the genetic subtypes in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, blood samples from 547 HIV-1 infected patients failing antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, were collected during the years 2002 and 2003 to perform the viral resistance genotyping at the Renageno Laboratory from Rio de Janeiro (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation). Viral resistance genotyping was performed using ViroSeq Genotyping System (Celera Diagnostic-Abbott, US). The HIV-1 subtyping based on polymerase (pol) gene sequences (protease and reverse transcriptase-RT regions) was as follows: subtype B (91.2%), subtype F (4.9%), and B/F viral recombinant forms (3.3%). The subtype C was identified in two patients (0.4%) and the recombinant CRF_02/AG virus was found infecting one patient (0.2%). The HIV-1 genotyping profile associated to the reverse transcriptase inhibitors has shown a high frequency of the M184V mutation followed by the timidine-associated mutations. The K103N mutation was the most prevalent to the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor and the resistance associated to protease inhibitor showed the minor mutations L63P, L10F/R, and A71V as the more prevalent. A large proportion of subtype B was observed in HIV-1 treated patients from Rio de Janeiro. In addition, we have identified the circulation of drug-resistant HIV-1 subtype C and are presenting the first report of the occurrence of an African recombinant CRF_02/AG virus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A clear association between HIV-1 subtypes and protease resistance mutations was observed in this study. The maintenance of resistance genotyping programs for HIV-1 failing patients is important to the management of ARV therapies and to attempt and monitor the HIV-1 subtype prevalence in Brazil."
4515,0.003,3.0,"We present a case of a clinical manifest hepatitis B virus infection and a potentially misleading HBV serological profile in an HIV-1 positive patient despite previous HBV vaccination. The patient presented with an acute hepatitis B and there was no indication of chronic HBV infection or the presence of a mutation in the 'a' determinant. Remarkably, simultaneously with high HBV surface antigen and HBV viral load, high anti-HBs antibodies were present. If, due to previous HBV vaccination only anti-HBs was tested in this patient, the result of the high anti-HBs antibodies could be very misleading and offering a false sense of security. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on how to assess HBV specific immunological memory and determining the role of HBV booster vaccinations in immunocompromised individuals."
7230,0.003,3.0,"Like tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease is associated with poverty and social inequalities, conditions that hamper the delivery of care. Like tuberculosis, treatment of HIV infection requires multidrug regimens, and the causative agent acquires drug resistance, which can be transmitted to others. A pilot project in rural Haiti introduced DOT-HAART (directly observed therapy with highly active antiretroviral therapy) for the care of patients with advanced acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A similar DOT-HAART effort was launched in Boston for patients with drug-resistant HIV disease who had experienced failure of unsupervised therapy. In both settings, community health promoters or accompagnateurs provide more than DOT: they offer psychosocial support and link patients to clinical staff and available resources. DOT-HAART in these 2 settings presents both challenges and opportunities. These models of care can be applied to other poverty-stricken populations in resource-poor settings."
3126,0.003,3.0,"The aim of immune-based therapies in HIV infection is to enhance numbers and function of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes especially specific anti-HIV cellular immune responses in order to allow immune control of viral replication. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been extensively studied in phase II trials. Intermittent administration of subcutaneous IL-2 results in substantial increases in CD4 cell counts in most HIV-patients. Two large-scale phase III international studies are addressing the key remaining question of the clinical benefit associated with CD4 cell expansions in HIV-infected patients receiving IL-2. Other cytokines including interferon-alpha are currently under investigation in phase II trials. The goal of therapeutic immunizations is to enhance and broaden the immune system's ability to recognize HIV. Several vaccine candidates, also tested as immunogens for preventive vaccines, are currently studied in phase II trials in patients exhibiting viral suppression under highly active antiretroviral therapy. It has been demonstrated in rhesus monkeys'models that therapeutic immunizations can result in the induction of strong CD4 and CD8 responses associated with viral control and prevention of clinical AIDS, following challenge with a highly pathogenic strain of chimeric SIV-HIV. The clinical efficacy of immune-based strategies remains to be demonstrated in randomized controlled clinical trials. Participation of immune system to control of viral replication may allow simplification of antiretroviral treatment which results in long-term adverse effects having impact in life quality of persons living with HIV."
7073,0.003,3.0,"After notification of a case of fulminant hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a 83-year-old female resident of a nursing home to the Flemish Health Inspectorate, a seroepidemiological study and a retrospective cohort study were conducted among the 94 residents and 47 nursing staff to assess the extent of HBV transmission and to identify risk factors. Susceptible residents were vaccinated against HBV and their serological response to hepatitis B vaccination determined. From December 2002 to April 2003, five residents with acute hepatitis B infection were identified with an attack rate of 5.5% and a case fatality rate of 40%. Three other residents were identified as HBV surface antigen and e-antigen positive carrier. None of the nursing staff tested positive for acute HBV infection or HBV carriage. Diabetic patients who were exposed to a shared finger-stick device for blood sampling were 10.7 times more likely to contract an acute HBV infection (RR 10.7; 95% CI 1.3-91.3). Other potential risk factors were undergoing podiatric care and being exposed to the shared razor blade of the hairdresser. The transmission of the infection could be controlled by restricting the use of finger-stick capillary sampling devices to individual patients, assigning separate glucometers to individual patients and, implementation of standard infection-control recommendations like wearing gloves and performing hand hygiene by the nursing staff, assigning separate podiatric sets to individual patients. HBV vaccination of the residents with three doses of HBV vaccine has not induced a sufficient degree of protection. The outbreak stresses the need for appropriate and generally applied standard procedures in nursing homes to prevent bloodborne pathogens."
3897,0.003,3.0,"Hemodialysis (HD) patients are particularly vulnerable to Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and have less sustained and lower antibody response to HBV vaccination. Among blood-borne pathogens, HBV can stay alive on environmental surfaces for over a week. The incidence of HBV was extremely high among HD patients. HBV vaccination, screening of blood products and infection control measures lead to significant decrease of HBV among HD patients. The infection control measures include; Medication safety and injection practices, environmental cleaning and disinfection, reuse of dialyzers for same patients, hand hygiene, isolation and barrier precautions, HBV vaccination and routine serology checking, assuring HBV immune status for HD unit staff, transmission based precautions and outbreak management.

7691,0.003,3.0,"Magnetic resonance (MR) scans were performed as part of a prospective neuropsychological study within the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Fifty HIV-1-seronegative men, 85 HIV-1-seropositive men without constitutional symptoms, and 14 with symptomatic HIV disease underwent MR imaging using a uniform protocol. Scans were rated by neuroradiologists blinded to all clinical details except age. The majority of MR scans were normal in all of the clinical groups and no covert mass lesions or diffuse white matter abnormalities were identified. Focal hyperintensities in the white matter were observed in 24% of the HIV-1 seronegatives, 26% of HIV-1 asymptomatic seropositives (CDC II/III), and 17% of those with ARC/AIDS. No significant associations were noted between the white matter hyperintensities and HIV-1 serostatus, neurological abnormalities, CD4 count, alcohol or drug use, hypertension, or smoking. In one individual classified with early HIV-1 dementia, MR demonstrated several hyperintensities in the deep parietal white matter, but at autopsy no microscopic abnormalities corresponding to the MR findings were identified. Our studies imply that focal white matter hyperintensities identified on MR are not specific for HIV-1 infection and are probably incidental and of no clinical significance."

5108,0.003,3.0,"High prevalence of tobacco use and low success in quitting remain significant problems for reducing disease burden among HIV-infected persons. This study's purpose was to examine participant responsiveness and tobacco dependence treatment adherence and their influences on tobacco abstinence among HIV-infected patients. This non-randomized study included HIV-infected smokers 18 years of age or older, who smoked at least 5 cigarettes per day, and had an interest in quitting smoking in the next 30 days. HIV-infected smokers (n = 247) received a 12-week tobacco dependence treatment intervention that included pharmacotherapy and telephone counseling. Younger age and non-White race were associated with lower adherence to pharmacotherapy. Younger age, non-White race, and increased monthly binge drinking were associated with lower adherence to telephone counseling. High participant responsiveness was associated with adherence to pharmacotherapy, counseling, and abstinence. Development and testing of interventions to improve adherence to evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment is warranted."
171,0.003,3.0,"We retrospectively assessed the frequency and clinical characteristics of headache occurring in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients in whom we had excluded all other causes, and determined the frequency of a similar headache in an HIV-negative group. Over a 1-year period, the HIV-related headache occurred in 2.8% of total admissions to the HIV service as opposed to 0.2% of admissions to the neurology service. The affected patients had advanced HIV infection (CD4+ cell count = 58.9 +/- 80.3; normal, > 500 x 10(-6)/l). The headache had features similar to those ascribed to HIV aseptic meningitis and was not related to the presence of AIDS dementia complex or its subsequent development over a 6-month follow-up. We propose that this is a distinct clinical entity related to HIV infection that is similar, if not identical, to HIV aseptic meningitis except for the lack of a CSF pleocytosis, probably reflecting the lymphocyte depletion that is characteristic of the more advanced state of HIV infection."
7236,0.003,3.0,"Tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione (TIBO) derivatives were shown to specifically block human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication through a unique interaction with the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Through further modification of the lead compounds and structure-activity relationship analysis several new TIBO derivatives that show high potency, selectivity, and specificity against HIV-1 have been obtained. A new TIBO derivative, R86183, inhibits the replication of HIV-1, but not HIV-2, in a variety of CD4+ T-cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes, at a concentration of 0.3 to 30 nM, which is at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than the 50% cytotoxic concentration. Whereas an HIV-1 strain containing the Leu-100-->Ile mutation in the RT gene is about 400-fold less susceptible, R86183 still inhibits the replication of an HIV-1 strain containing the Tyr-181-->Cys RT mutation by 50% at a concentration of 130 nM. R86183 inhibits the poly(C).oligo(dG)12-18-directed HIV-1 RT reaction by 50% at a concentration of 57 nM. The antiviral activity of 22 TIBO derivatives in cell culture correlated well with their activity against HIV-1 RT. No such correlation was found for their cytotoxicity. The combination of R86183 with either zidovudine or didanosine resulted in a synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 (strain IIIB) replication. Combination of R86183 with the protease inhibitor Ro31-8959 was found to be additive. Also described is a dilution protocol circumventing overestimation and underestimation of antiviral activity due to adherence to plastic surfaces."
7171,0.003,3.0,"We report four cases of immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmitted through heterosexual contact in persons who were not homosexual, addicted to intravenous narcotic drugs, or hemophilic. Each transmission occurred in a different setting. A 23-year-old white woman had immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura in July 1985, with a platelet count of 11 X 10(9)/L. In January 1987, she had prominent submandibular and posterior cervical adenopathy. A careful social-sexual history revealed several sexual contacts with a male narcotic addict before July 1985. A 27-year-old heterosexual white man had a platelet count of 8 X 10(9)/L in December 1986. A social-sexual history revealed that his fiancée had been an intravenous narcotic addict 6 years ago. A 64-year-old white woman had a platelet count of 75 X 10(9)/L in May 1986, approximately 2 years after she had resumed having sexual intercourse with her husband who had had a triple coronary bypass in October 1983. The husband had received HIV-seropositive blood. A 42-year-old white man had a platelet count of 45 X 10(9)/L, which was associated with a cutaneous eruption refractory to antibiotics and antifungal agents. He had had sexual contacts with several women, who, to the best of his knowledge, were neither prostitutes nor intravenous narcotic addicts. He denied homosexuality or drug abuse. All four patients were HIV-seropositive and had circulating immune complexes and platelet-associated IgG, C3C4, and IgM values that were considerably higher than those usually measured in patients with classic autoimmune thrombocytopenia, averaging 2.4-, 2.2-, 6.5- and 5.2-fold higher, respectively. Thus, HIV-related immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura can be heterosexually spread and should become part of the differential diagnosis of unexplained thrombocytopenia. Obtaining a careful social-sexual history is mandatory in such patients."
6274,0.003,3.0,"The social stigma in patients with hepatitis B virus infection has caused several complications for both the patients and the associated medical system. This study aimed at demonstrating the social stigma experienced by these patients in Iran. This is a qualitative study using a content analysis approach with references to primary and secondary sources. The data were collected through 15 unstructured and in-depth interviews conducted in 2014. By analyzing the data, two main themes were noted: extrinsic concepts of social stigma (causing reprehension, embarrassment, and discrimination) and intrinsic concepts of social stigma (sense of rejection, isolation, and frustration). The analysis of participants' experiences showed that social stigma is a simple lack of knowledge among the patients and society and it is more intense in the first days after the diagnosis. Stigma is prevalent among patients with hepatitis B virus, causes them to hide the disease, and provokes various complications for them as well as society. This study emphasizes the necessity of implementing health education programs about hepatitis B and its associated stigma, especially considering the potential impact of a mass media campaign."
9612,0.003,3.0,"Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NNRTIs) are important components of current combination therapies for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. In screening of chemical libraries, we found 6-azido-1-benzyl-3-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)uracil (AzBBU) and 6-amino-1-benzyl-3-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)uracil (AmBBU) to be highly active and selective inhibitors of HIV-1 replication in vitro. To determine the resistance profiles of these compounds, we conducted a long-term culture of HIV-1-infected MT-4 cells with escalating concentrations of each compound. After serial passages of the infected cells, escape viruses were obtained, and they were more than 500-fold resistant to the uracil derivatives compared to the wild type. Sequence analysis was conducted for RT of the escape viruses at passages 12 and 24. The amino acid mutation Y181C in the polymerase domain of RT was detected for all escape viruses. Docking studies using the crystal structure of RT showed that AmBBU requires the amino acid residues Leu100, Val106, Tyr181, and Trp229 for exerting its inhibitory effect on HIV-1. Four additional amino acid changes (K451R, R461K, T468P, and D471N) were identified in the RNase H domain of RT; however, their precise role in the acquisition of resistance is still unclear. In conclusion, the initial mutation Y181C seems sufficient for the acquisition of resistance to the uracil derivatives AzBBU and AmBBU. Further studies are required to determine the precise role of each mutation in the acquisition of HIV-1 resistance."
8048,0.003,3.0,"Perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 represents a major problem in many regions of the world, especially Southern Africa. With the exception of viral and proviral load, the role for maternal cofactors in perinatal transmission outcome is largely unknown. In this study, an assessment was made of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) gene-expression profiles to better understand transcriptional changes associated with HIV-1 infection and perinatal transmission among young adult mothers with infants in Botswana. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells specimens were used from 25 HIV+ drug naive and 20 HIV- healthy mothers, similar in age and location, collected in 1999-2000 and 2003, and processed with the exact same methods, as previously described. Expression profiling of 22 277 microarray gene probes implicated a broad initiation of innate response gene-sets, including toll-like receptor, interferon-stimulated and antiviral RNA response pathways in association with maternal HIV-1 infection. Maternal transmission status was further associated with host genes that influence RNA processing and splicing patterns. In addition to real-time polymerase chain reaction validation of specific genes, enriched category validation of PBMC profiles was conducted using two independent data sets for either HIV-1 infection or an unrelated RNA virus, severe acute respiratory virus infection. HIV-1 pathogen-specific host profiles should prove a useful tool in infection and transmission intervention efforts worldwide."
6457,0.003,3.0,"We have investigated the molecular diversity of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) among the HIV co-infected patients from eastern-India. HBsAg/HBV-DNA positive subjects (n=73) from 874 HIV-infected patients were analyzed by sequencing followed by genetic diversity quantification. HBV/genotype-D and HBV/sugenotype-D2 were predominant. HBV/D2 isolates from patients with low CD4 count manifested significantly lower non-synonymous substitutions (p<0.0001) and Shannon entropy (p=0.0006) in their surface and polymerase gene in comparison to those from moderately increased CD4 count. ART-induced immune-reconstitution therefore might raise non-synonymous immune/therapy escape substitutions among these HBV/D2 isolates. Decreased genetic diversity and increased viral load in the HBV/D2 isolates might facilitate the maintenance of their wild type characteristics in the low CD4 count, leading to its increased prevalence in this group. Interestingly, genetic diversity in HBV/A1, the next common subgenotype, was modified in the opposite manner. Together our results underscore the need for proper HBV molecular monitoring in HIV co-infection."
2256,0.003,3.0,"Between 1984 and 1990, virus was routinely isolated and serum collected from patients diagnosed at hospitals in the Western Cape as suffering from AIDS or AIDS-related conditions (ARC). From these, 17 virus strains were selected at random for sequencing and molecular characterisation of the env gene. The strains were previously characterised as belonging to HIV-1 subtypes B, C and D. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate retrospectively the serological diagnosis of HIV-1 in these 17 South African patients. Thirteen anti-HIV screening assays, including 7 rapid/simple test devices (RTDs), 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (EIAs) and 2 Western immunoblot assays were evaluated. Using commercial EIAs, 16 serum samples were HIV antibody-positive and these results were confirmed by Western immunoblot analysis. Serum from one terminal AIDS patient was found negative with all the serological tests. Some RTDs gave false negative antibody reactions on specimens from patients infected with subtype D strains. To investigate the false negative antibody reactions, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify, clone and sequence proviral DNA from the immunodominant gp41 region from 7 of the HIV-1 strains. Two patients, both subtype D strains (D214 and D482) with false negative results in the RTDs, showed a significant amino acid substitution, i.e., substitution of a histidine residue for leucine at env position 607. It was concluded that although there were false negative RTD reactions on patients with HIV-1 subtype D strains, the commercial EIAs tested are sensitive and are able to detect patients infected with HIV-1 subtypes B, C and D that are present in South Africa."
9678,0.003,3.0,"We report the occurrence of congenital toxoplasmosis in three infants born to HIV infected women who had high anti-toxoplasma IgG and negative IgM during pregnancy. We briefly reviewed available literature and discussed the possible transmission mechanisms of congenital toxoplasmosis among HIV infected pregnant women. Serum samples were tested for Toxoplasma gondii IgM and IgG antibodies using commercial enzyme immunoassay and IgG-avidity tests. In the first case, fetal death occurred at 28th week of gestation. In the second case, congenital toxoplasmosis was diagnosis at 6th month of life; and in the third case, an HIV-infected newborn, congenital toxoplasmosis was asymptomatic. These cases point out to the possibility of enhanced maternal-fetal transmission of T. gondii infection by HIV-infected women chronically infected, which may have important public health consequences, considering that increasing frequency of HIV-infection has been observed among women of childbearing age around the world."
1605,0.003,3.0,"To achieve optimal virologic suppression for children undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART), adherence must be excellent. This is defined as taking more than 95% of their prescribed doses. To our knowledge, no study in Ethiopia has evaluated the level of treatment adherence at the beginning of the child's treatment. Our aim was therefore to evaluate caregiver-reported ART non-adherence among children and any predictors for this during the early course of treatment. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 306 children with HIV in eight health facilities in Ethiopia who were registered at ART clinics between 20 December 2014 and 20 April 2015. The adherence rate reported by caregivers during the first week and after a month of treatment initiation was 92.8% and 93.8%, respectively. Our findings highlight important predictors of non-adherence. Children whose caregivers were not undergoing HIV treatment and care themselves were less likely to be non-adherent during the first week of treatment (aOR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.71) and the children whose caregivers did not use a medication reminder after one month of treatment initiation (aOR = 5.21, 95% CI: 2.23, 12.16) were more likely to miss the prescribed dose. Moreover, after one month of the treatment initiation, those receiving protease inhibitor (LPV/r) or ABC-based treatment regimens were more likely to be non-adherent (aOR = 12.32, 95% CI: 3.25, 46.67). To promote treatment adherence during ART initiation in children, particular emphasis needs to be placed on a baseline treatment regimen and ways to issue reminders about the child's medication to both the health care system and caregivers. Further, large scale studies using a combination of adherence measuring methods upon treatment initiation are needed to better define the magnitude and predictors of ART non-adherence in resource-limited settings."
574,0.003,3.0,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy is essential to treatment success for individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Despite the wealth of studies in examining antiretroviral non-adherence, few have distinguished between intentional and unintentional non-adherence. The present study attempted to identify factors associated with adherence, intentional non-adherence, and unintentional non-adherence among HIV+ individuals using a longitudinal design. Dietary instructions and medication schedule were also included to measure the subtleties of antiretroviral adherence. One hundred and two HIV+ patients who were under antiretroviral therapy were recruited in an outpatient clinic in Hong Kong at baseline with six months follow-up. Using the conventional adherence rate, only 12 (11.8%) of participants reported having missed/ altered medication in the past four days. However, using a more comprehensive assessment, only 27 (26.5%) participants were classified as adherers. Results showed that, adherers were significantly older and had higher adherence self-efficacy than those who were unintentional or intentional non-adherers. Participants classified as unintentional non-adherers had longer length of diagnosis and started medication longer than adherers and intentional non-adherers. Participants classified as intentional non-adherers had worse mental health, higher level of self-stigma, and reported higher score in avoidant coping than adherers and unintentional non-adherers. They also scored higher in physical symptoms than adherers. Findings highlight the importance of a reliable, comprehensive measurement for adherence and extend on previous adherence literature that intentional and unintentional non-adherence are separate entities and are associated with different factors. Future research should understand the intentions behind non-adherence and this would serve as an important guide in the development of interventions aimed at improving antiretroviral adherence for HIV+ patients."
2709,0.003,3.0,"Chronic hepatitis B affects nearly 10% of HIV-infected patients. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a dynamic disease and coinfection with HIV impacts directly on the outcome of HBV infection, considerably complicating its natural history, diagnosis, and management. The aim of this study was to compare two cohorts of HBV monoinfected and HBV/HIV coinfected Iranian patients undergoing long-term lamivudine therapy from the clinical and virological aspects, as well as the frequency of detected mutations in HBV genome. To this end, HBV Pol/S regions from 72 patients were PCR-amplified and directly sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a 40-times higher risk of coinfection with ayw3 subtype of HBV genotype D rather than ayw2 subtype [P<0.001, odd: 40.66, CI: 95 % (4.69-352.23)]. While no resistance mutation was detected in HBV/HIV coinfected cohort, LAM-resistance mutations (rtM204I/V in YMDD and rtL180M in FLLA polymerase motifs) were identified in 30% (9 out of 30) and 16.66% (5 out of 30) of HBV monoinfected patients (P<0.05). Moreover, several mutations (sP105A, sI110S/L, sS136Y and sP127T/L) with significant differences in the frequency were identified in the S region of both cohorts. Finally, this study found strong correlation between the type of infection (mono or coinfection) and characteristics like patient gender, ALT levels, HBV-DNA levels and HBV subtypes. These results pointed to the importance of determination of HBV variants in the management of patients and suggested that in contrary to HBV monoinfections, LAM may be still an appropriate drug for the treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV coinfected patients; however, further studies to clarify the role of HIV in HBV LAM-resistance mutations are required."
7837,0.003,3.0,"The effect of macrophage (M)-tropic and T cell line (T)-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection on antigen-specific CD4 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) has been studied using a CD4 CTL line specific for a peptide from influenza B virus hemagglutinin. In the absence of antigen presentation, the production of CC chemokines was low. Both the M-tropic HIV-1 strain (HIV-1AD) and the T-tropic HIV-1 strain (HIV-1LAI) established productive infections in the CD4 CTLs, decreasing antigen-specific cytotoxicity. Peptide presented to the CD4 CTLs increased their secretion of RANTES and MIP-1beta, suppressed M-tropic HIV-1 replication, downmodulated CCR5 expression, and preserved CTL recognition. The suppression of M-tropic HIV-1 replication and downmodulation of the CCR5 receptor likely resulted from CC chemokine secretion since antibodies to CC chemokines restored M-tropic HIV-1 replication. Antigen presentation did not protect CD4 CTLs from T-tropic HIV-1 infection or preserve their CTL recognition. Thus, these CD4 CTLs do not make suppressor factors that inhibit the T-tropic HIV-1LAI isolate. The results indicate that these CD4 CTLs can either harbor or suppress M-tropic HIV-1 infection, depending on whether antigen is present. CD4 CTLs might therefore provide some protection in the early stages of HIV-1 infection when M-tropic isolates are present."
6651,0.003,3.0,"Current interferon (IFN)-based therapies for hepatitis C in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) may be limited by incomplete virological response, lack of adherence, and poor tolerability. Newer therapies for hepatitis C will target viral replication (e.g., HCV serine protease inhibitors, helicase inhibitors, RNA interference, or an HCV polymerase inhibitor). Other treatments will focus on viral translation (e.g., antisense molecules). Additions to IFN therapy that can modulate the immune response (e.g., thymosin, isatorbine, or injectable histamine) may improve tolerability of treatment. There need to be targets that minimize the inflammatory response by the liver (e.g., IFN-gamma). There are some therapeutic vaccines in early development. Drugs to replace or enhance ribavirin are being studied with IFN-based treatments. Strategic treatment trials that address sequencing of HCV and HIV therapy with current and future therapeutic agents and combination therapy need to be undertaken."

2952,0.003,3.0,"Antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infected children. However, development of ARV resistance in these children is a major public health problem due to lack of availability of and access to new drugs. This study was conducted in order to identify circulating HIV subtypes and recombinant forms and evaluate the drug resistance mutation patterns in 18 HIV-1 infected children failing ARV treatment in Kelantan, Malaysia. Genotyping for codon 1-99 of protease (PR) and 1-250 of reverse transcriptase (RT) were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing. Subsequently, these were phylogenetically analyzed to determine the subtypes. CRF33_01B (44.4%) was found to be the predominant HIV subtype, followed by B (27.8%), CRF15_01B (16.7%) and CRF01_AE (11.1%) subtypes. The most prevalent RT mutations were T215F/V/Y (66.7%), D67G/N (55.6%), K219Q/E/R (44.4%), M184V/I (38.9%), K70R/E (27.8%) and M41L (27.8%), associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) resistance; and K103N (55.6%), G190A (33.3%), and K101P/E/H (27.8%) associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) resistance. The results showed a possible emergence of CRF33_01B as current predominant subtypes/circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), and a high frequency of primary mutations among HIV-1 infected children after failure of ARV therapy in Kelantan, Malaysia."
5988,0.003,3.0,"Adverse reactions to the standard dose (1,200 mg/day-1,500 mg/day) of azidothymidine (AZT) are serious. An in vitro pharmacokinetic study of intracellular AZT-5'-triphosphate suggested the feasibility of a clinical trial with reduced doses of AZT. A randomized trial with reduced doses of AZT (group A; 400 mg/day, n = 15, group B; 800 mg/day, n = 13), was conducted enrolling 28 patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. The effective rate of AZT on CD4+ lymphocyte counts was similar for both groups, but the duration of the effect of AZT was significantly longer in group A (p less than 0.05). In group B, adverse reactions were more frequently observed (p less than 0.01), and AZT was withdrawn or the dose was reduced more frequently (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that AZT at a dose of 400 mg/day is less toxic, and is more beneficial for long-term treatment."
631,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects an estimated 3.5 million persons in the United States (1), making it the most common bloodborne infection in the country. Recent surveillance data showed increased rates of HCV infection among adolescents and adults who are predominantly white, live in nonurban areas, and have a history of injection drug use.* U.S. birth certificate data were used to analyze trends and geographic variations in rates of HCV infection among women giving birth during 2009-2014. Birth certificates from Tennessee were used to examine individual characteristics and outcomes associated with HCV infection, using a multivariable model to calculate adjusted odds of HCV-related diagnosis in pregnancy among women with live births. During 2009-2014, HCV infection present at the time of delivery among pregnant women from states reporting HCV on the birth certificate increased 89%, from 1.8 to 3.4 per 1,000 live births. The highest infection rate in 2014 (22.6 per 1,000 live births) was in West Virginia; the rate in Tennessee was 10.1. In adjusted analyses of Tennessee births, the odds of HCV infection were approximately threefold higher among women residing in rural counties than among those in large urban counties, 4.5-fold higher among women who smoked cigarettes during pregnancy, and nearly 17-fold higher among women with concurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HCV infection among pregnant women is an increasing and potentially modifiable threat to maternal and child health. Clinicians and public health officials should consider individual and population-level opportunities for prevention and risk mitigation."
7063,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV-1) was determined in 924 outpatients attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic. The overall prevalence of anti-HIV-1 was 9%. Six of 14 intravenous drug addicts and 4 of 34 patients of African origin were anti-HIV-1 positive. In the other 876 patients, the anti-HIV prevalence was 6.6% in 467 heterosexual men, 5% in 261 heterosexual women and 22.3% in 148 homosexual or bisexual men. The prevalence of anti-HIV-1 in the heterosexual subjects was much higher than that expected in the general population and than that observed in patients attending sexually transmitted disease clinics in other developed countries. Intravenous drug abusers, who represent the most important group at risk for AIDS in Italy, could contribute to the spread of HIV infection through heterosexual contacts with persons without other known risk factors."
4422,0.003,3.0,"Although the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has become a chronic illness, disease-specific advance care planning has not yet been evaluated for the palliative care needs of adults with HIV/AIDS. This prospective, longitudinal, randomized, two-arm controlled clinical trial aims to test the efficacy of FAmily CEntered advance care planning among adults living with AIDS and/or HIV with co-morbidities on congruence in treatment preferences, healthcare utilization, and quality of life. The FAmily CEntered intervention arm is two face-to-face sessions with a trained, certified facilitator: Session 1) Disease-Specific Advance Care Planning Respecting Choices Interview; Session 2) Completion of advance directive. The Healthy Living Control arm is: Session 1) Developmental/Relationship History; Session 2) Nutrition. Follow-up data will be collected at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-intervention. A total of 288 patient/surrogate dyads will be enrolled from five hospital-based, out-patient clinics in Washington, District of Columbia. Participants will be HIV positive and ≥ 21 years of age; surrogates will be ≥ 18 years of age. Exclusion criteria are homicidality, suicidality, psychosis, and impaired cognitive functioning. We hypothesize that this intervention will enhance patient-centered communication with a surrogate decision-maker about end of life treatment preferences over time, enhance patient quality of life and decrease health care utilization. We further hypothesize that this intervention will decrease health disparities for Blacks in completion of advance directives. If proposed aims are achieved, the benefits of palliative care, particularly increased treatment preferences about end-of-life care and enhanced quality of life, will be extended to people living with AIDS."
8753,0.003,3.0,"An association of increased weight with a slower progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease has been reported in studies that have not included large numbers of women. We evaluated the association of HIV disease progression with body mass index (BMI) in 871 women and present cross-sectional, survival, and longitudinal analyses. A higher baseline BMI was associated with a lower rate of occurrence of the first CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm(3). In analyses that incorporated time-varying BMI, underweight and normal women had an increased risk of clinical acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and underweight women had increased risk of HIV-related death, compared with obese women. The association between change in BMI and CD4 cell count was estimated; increases in BMI were associated with slight increases in CD4 cell counts, even after controlling for prior values of CD4 cell count, viral load, and treatment. Higher BMI and increases in BMI are associated with a decreased risk of HIV progression."
1272,0.003,3.0,"In order to analyse temporal trends in vertical transmission rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and determinant of congenital HIV infection in Italy, we have considered data from a network of hospitals co-operating in the Italian Collaborative Study on HIV infection in pregnancy, conducted between 1988 and 1995. A total of 1040 women entered the study. The HIV-1 status of the babies was known in 848 cases (81.5%). Transmission rates were highest in the period 1988-1991, then tended to decrease and in 1995 the rate was 9.7 per 100 children (this finding, however, was based on only six infected children and the trend was not statistically significant). Considering the overall series, the risk of vertical HIV transmission was higher in women with low CD4 count in pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) < 400 versus > or = 400 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.9]. In comparison with vaginal delivery the risk of transmission was 0.3 (95% CI 0.1-0.5) and 0.6 (95% CI 0.3-1.2) respectively for elective and emergency delivery. In comparison with women who delivered at term (> or = 37 gestation weeks) the OR of HIV infection of the babies for the whole series was 2.2 (95% CI 1.3-3.6) in women who delivered preterm. Similar findings emerged when the analysis was conducted considering, separately, subjects observed in the period 1988-1991 and 1992-1995. The frequency of Caesarean section increased from 26.5% of deliveries in 1988-1991 to 36.2% in 1992-1995. Consequently, most temporal differences disappeared after standardization for mode of delivery, but the rate in 1995 was still lower than in 1988-1994."
2794,0.003,3.0,"An increased incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported among human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients or those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite this association, hitherto only a single case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported in an HIV-infected patient during pregnancy. We describe a young multiparous patient with long-standing AIDS who presented with lower abdominal pain. Following findings of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, low-grade fever, and mental status changes, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was diagnosed after initially considering the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia, and the patient was delivered by cesarean section. The patient required multiple plasma exchanges during a protracted postpartum course, and was discharged in good health. This first report of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and AIDS in pregnancy demonstrates that when encountering preeclampsia in patients with AIDS, thrombotic microangiopathy should be strongly considered. In addition, these patients may exhibit an attenuated response to plasma exchange therapy and despite previous reports in nonobstetric patients, a favorable outcome is attainable in these critically ill patients."

This study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its related factors among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Thailand. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 259 patients at a tertiary care hospital. HRQOL was assessed using the Thai version of the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) questionnaire. Socio-demographics and clinical status were measured using a self-administered questionnaire. Multiple linear regression models were used to explore associations between socio-demographic status, clinical status, and HRQL. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that employment status was strongly related to better overall physical and mental health summary scores (PHS, MHS). In addition, patients with disclosure of HIV status, aged over 50 years, and having at least a rating of good health in the nurses' opinion were the independent positive predictive factors for overall PHS. While being on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and good compliance with ART were positive predictive factors for overall MHS. Improving and strengthening quality of life among PLWHAs are important goals for HIV/AIDS services. Regular assessment of HRQL can provide potential information for intervention to improve quality of life."
233,0.003,3.0,"Pneumocystis pneumonia is a potentially life-threatening pulmonary infection that occurs in immunocompromised individuals and HIV-infected patients with a low CD4 cell count. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been used as the first-line agent for treatment, but mutations within dihydropteroate synthase gene render potential resistance to sulfamide. Despite advances of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), Pneumocystis pneumonia continues to occur in HIV-infected patients with late presentation for cART or virological and immunological failure after receiving cART. Areas covered: This review summarizes the diagnosis and first-line and alternative treatment and prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-infected patients. Articles for this review were identified through searching PubMed. Search terms included: 'Pneumocystis pneumonia', 'Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia', 'Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia', 'trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'primaquine', 'trimetrexate', 'dapsone', 'pentamidine', 'atovaquone', 'echinocandins', 'human immunodeficiency virus infection', 'acquired immunodeficiency syndrome', 'resistance to sulfamide' and combinations of these terms. We limited the search to English language papers that were published between 1981 and March 2017. We screened all identified articles and cross-referenced studies from retrieved articles. Expert commentary: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole will continue to be the first-line agent for Pneumocystis pneumonia given its cost, availability of both oral and parenteral formulations, and effectiveness or efficacy in both treatment and prophylaxis. Whether resistance due to mutations within dihydropteroate synthase gene compromises treatment effectiveness remains controversial. Continued search for effective alternatives with better safety profiles for Pneumocystis pneumonia is warranted."
1067,0.003,3.0,The role of placenta in vertical transmission is not yet fully understood. A protective role of the placenta during gestation is suggested by the finding that caesarian sections reduce the risk of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 from mother to child three- to fourfold. Here we investigated whether the immunological milieu of the placenta might be important in HIV-1 transmission. In situ imaging of immunohistochemically stained placenta sections and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a fourfold increase in CCR5:CXCR4 expression ratio in placentae from transmitting women compared to placentae from nontransmitting women. This chemokine receptor repertoire was consistent with an up-regulation of interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 expression in placentae from nontransmitting placentae compared to transmitting placentae. In situ imaging demonstrated that CCR5 and CXCR4 were expressed on placental macrophages and lymphocytes but not in trophoblasts. Simultaneous immunofluorescence/ultrasensitive in situ hybridization for HIV-1 gag-pol mRNA revealed that HIV-1 infects primarily CXCR4-expressing cells in placentae from nontransmitting women whereas predominantly CCR5-expressing cells were infected in placentae from transmitting women. These data are consistent with transmission of a homogeneous population of nonsyncytium-inducing HIV-1 isolates that use CCR5 as co-receptor.
3028,0.003,3.0,"Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the risk of drug-sensitive HIV transmission but may increase the transmission of drug-resistant HIV. We used a mathematical model to estimate the long-term population-level benefits of ART and determine the scenarios under which earlier ART (treatment at 1 year post-infection, on average) could decrease simultaneously both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence (new infections). We constructed an infection-age-structured mathematical model that tracked the transmission rates over the course of infection and modelled the patients' life expectancy as a function of ART initiation timing. We fitted this model to the annual AIDS incidence and death data directly, and to resistance data and demographic data indirectly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco. Using counterfactual scenarios, we assessed the impact on total and drug-resistant HIV incidence of ART initiation timing, frequency of acquired drug resistance, and second-line drug effectiveness (defined as the combination of resistance monitoring, biomedical drug efficacy and adherence). Earlier ART initiation could decrease the number of both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence when second-line drug effectiveness is sufficiently high (greater than 80%), but increase the proportion of new infections that are drug resistant. Thus, resistance may paradoxically appear to be increasing while actually decreasing."
2029,0.003,3.0,"Occult hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) is characterized by HBV DNA positivity but HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negativity. Occult HBV infection is associated with a risk of HBV transmission through blood transfusion, hemodialysis, and liver transplantation. Furthermore, occult HBV infection contributes to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We recently reported the characteristic molecular features of mutations in the preS/S regions among Korean individuals with occult infections caused by HBV genotype C2; the variants of preS and S related to severe liver diseases among chronically infected patients were also responsible for the majority of HBV occult infections. We also reported that HBsAg variants from occult-infected Korean individuals exhibit lower HBsAg secretion capacity but not reduced HBV DNA levels. In addition, these variants exhibit increased ROS-inducing capacity compared with the wild-type strain, linking HBV occult infections to liver cell damage. Taken together, our previous reports suggest the transmission potential of distinct HBV occult infection-related variants in South Korea. "
4245,0.003,3.0,"Concerns about the possible release of smallpox by bioterrorists has led to policies that recommend smallpox vaccination of some health care providers, and, in the near future, the vaccine may become available to the general population on a voluntary basis. Both smallpox virus (variola virus) and the smallpox vaccine (vaccinia virus) will have a significant impact on people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Given that populations with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and populations with immunosuppressed conditions due to solid organ and bone marrow transplantation were not present in the days when smallpox was prevalent, we will speculate on how smallpox might present in immunodeficient patients, and we will review the adverse events expected from the smallpox vaccine in hosts with HIV infection."
7739,0.003,3.0,"The efficacy of oral, intestinal, nasal, and vaginal vaccinations with DNA simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/interleukin-2 (IL-2)/IL-15, SIV Gag/Pol/Env recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA), and AT-2 SIVmac239 inactivated particles was compared in rhesus macaques after low-dose vaginal challenge with SIVmac251. Intestinal immunization provided better protection from infection, as a significantly greater median number of challenges was necessary in this group than in the others. Oral and nasal vaccinations provided the most significant control of disease progression. Fifty percent of the orally and nasally vaccinated animals suppressed viremia to undetectable levels, while this occurred to a significantly lower degree in intestinally and vaginally vaccinated animals and in controls. Viremia remained undetectable after CD8(+) T-cell depletion in seven vaccinated animals that had suppressed viremia after infection, and tissue analysis for SIV DNA and RNA was negative, a result consistent with a significant reduction of viral activity. Regardless of the route of vaccination, mucosal vaccinations prevented loss of CD4(+) central memory and CD4(+)/α4β7(+) T-cell populations and reduced immune activation to different degrees. None of the orally vaccinated animals and only one of the nasally vaccinated animals developed AIDS after 72 to 84 weeks of infection, when the trial was closed. The levels of anti-SIV gamma interferon-positive, CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells at the time of first challenge inversely correlated with viremia and directly correlated with protection from infection and longer survival.

193,0.003,3.0,"To determine the types and rates of tumors which may be associated with HIV infection in women, we used cancer incidence data from New York and northern New Jersey. We examined changes in incidence of selected cancers in women aged 20-49 years and compared groups differing in incidence of AIDS. Black women were compared to white women in New York City and in the remainder of New York State; for cervical cancer, rates were also compared for Blacks and Whites in northern New Jersey. The incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in women increased in New York City, beginning in 1982 for Blacks and in 1984 for Whites, but remained stable in the remainder of New York State. The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in New York women doubled in Blacks after 1982 whereas incidence trends in Whites were unchanged. No consistent variation was seen in the incidence of Hodgkin's disease. Cervical cancer in New York and northern New Jersey Blacks declined over the same period by approximately 40% for invasive tumors and 50% for in situ lesions. The HIV epidemic is associated with substantial excesses of Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in women. The absence of Kaposi's sarcoma in upstate New York women suggests the existence of a geographically restricted co-factor(s) for Kaposi's sarcoma in addition to HIV. If HIV affected cervical cancer incidence through 1988, its impact was small compared to the striking decreases which followed widespread adoption of Papanicolaou screening."
2362,0.003,3.0,"New human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) diagnoses are increasing rapidly in Hebei. The aim of this study presents the most extensive HIV-1 molecular epidemiology investigation in Hebei province in China thus far. We have carried out the most extensive systematic cross-sectional study based on newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive individuals in 2013, and characterized the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequences in the whole of Hebei. Nine HIV-1 genotypes based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequence were identified among 610 newly diagnosed naïve individuals. The four main genotypes were circulating recombinant form (CRF)01_AE (53.4%), CRF07_BC (23.4%), subtype B (15.9%), and unique recombinant forms URFs (4.9%). Within 1 year, three new genotypes (subtype A1, CRF55_01B, CRF65_cpx), unknown before in Hebei, were first found among men who have sex with men (MSM). All nine genotypes were identified in the sexually contracted HIV-1 population. Among 30 URFs, six recombinant patterns were revealed, including CRF01_AE/BC (40.0%), CRF01_AE/B (23.3%), B/C (16.7%), CRF01_AE/C (13.3%), CRF01_AE/B/A2 (3.3%) and CRF01_AE/BC/A2 (3.3%), plus two potential CRFs. This study elucidated the complicated characteristics of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology in a low HIV-1 prevalence northern province of China and revealed the high level of HIV-1 genetic diversity. All nine HIV-1 genotypes circulating in Hebei have spread out of their initial risk groups into the general population through sexual contact, especially through MSM. This highlights the urgency of HIV prevention and control in China."
2307,0.003,3.0,"Myeloid cells are important reservoirs of HIV-1 infection. In response to pathogenic agents, macrophages secrete inflammatory cytokines that can modulate viral replication and contribute to AIDS pathogenesis. Because HIV replication is dependent on cellular activation, immunosuppressive cytokines that deactivate macrophages and T cells may be important modulators of an antiviral effect. We tested the anti-HIV potential of the immunosuppressive cytokine-transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta 1) alone and in combination with AZT in a new monomyeloblastic model of HIV-1 infection. The PLB-985 cell model was infected with HIV IIIB strain, and the course of HIV-1 infection and replication was monitored by reverse transcriptase assay, p24 immunofluorescence, and northern blot analysis of HIV-1-specific mRNA. TGF-beta 1 as a single agent had no effect on the multiplication of HIV-IIIB in de novo-infected PLB 985 monomyeloblastic cells. However, cotreatment with TGF-beta 1 and AZT synergistically slowed virus multiplication within the first week following infection, as determined by reverse transcriptase measurement, p24 antigen detection, and northern blot analysis of viral RNA. The synergistic actions of TGF-beta 1 and AZT were also observed in PLB 985 cells infected with an AZT-resistant strain of HIV-1 (HIV 1393). Synergism between nucleoside analogs and cytokines may be an important therapeutic approach to HIV-1 infection. Elucidation of the role of cytokines in controlling the degree of HIV multiplication may have an impact on both clinical treatments and understanding the progression to AIDS."
2320,0.003,3.0,"Psychological distress is common among adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) worldwide, and has been associated with non-adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART), leading to poor virologic suppression, drug resistance, and increased risk for AIDS morbidity and mortality. However, only a few studies have explored the relationship between psychological distress and ART adherence among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper examines the relationship between psychological distress and ART adherence, and effect of psychosocial resources on ART adherence. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 464 ALHIV (aged 12-19; 53% female) seeking HIV care at a large HIV treatment center in Kampala, Uganda. ALHIV were recruited during routine clinic visits. Three self-reported binary adherence measures were utilized: missed pills in the past three days, non-adherence to the prescribed medical regimen, and self-rated adherence assessed using a visual analog scale. Psychological distress was measured as a continuous variable, and computed as the mean score on a locally developed and validated 25-item symptom checklist for Ugandan ALHIV. Psychosocial resources included spirituality, religiosity, optimism, social support, and coping strategies. After adjusting for respondents' socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial resources, a unit increase in psychological distress was associated with increased odds of missing pills in past 3 days (Odds Ratio(OR) = 1.75; Confidence Interval (CI): 1.04-2.95), not following the prescribed regimen (OR = 1.63; CI: 1.08-2.46), and lower self-rated adherence (OR = 1.79; CI: 1.19-2.69). Psychosocial resources were associated with lower odds for non-adherence on all three self-report measures. There is a need to strengthen the psychosocial aspects of adolescent HIV care by developing interventions to identify and prevent psychological distress among Ugandan ALHIV."

In patients with HIV, tenofovir alafenamide was as efficacious as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, with reduced bone and renal toxic effects. We compared the efficacy and safety of the two drugs in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a non-inferiority study."
9135,0.003,3.0,"Despite substantial progress in the development of antiretroviral regimens that durably suppress Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, new agents that maintain high efficacy while further optimizing the safety of lifelong, chronic therapy are needed. Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF; formerly known as GS-7340) is a novel prodrug of the antiviral acyclic nucleoside phosphonate tenofovir (TFV) with improved properties relative to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Although potent and generally well tolerated, TDF therapy has been associated with changes in markers of renal function, decreases in bone mineral density and a rare occurrence of serious renal adverse events, including Fanconi's Syndrome. The renal and bone toxicity observed with TDF is associated with high circulating plasma levels of TFV. TAF was discovered to be a more efficient prodrug able to further refine HIV therapy and better address life-long therapy in an older and increasingly comorbid HIV infected population. By enhancing stability in biological matrices while being rapidly activated in cells, TAF produces higher levels of intracellular TFV diphosphate, the pharmacologically active metabolite, in HIV-target cells at substantially reduced oral doses of TFV equivalents. All TFV released in the body is eventually eliminated renally; therefore, lowering the TFV equivalents administered reduces off-target kidney exposure. Effective therapy is thus achieved at approximately 90% lower systemic exposure to TFV, translating to statistically and clinically significant improvement in safety parameters associated with bone mineral density and markers of renal function.

7070,0.003,3.0,"For assessing the role of circulating immune complexes (CICs) in acute hepatitis B, CICs containing HBsAg, IgM, and IgG were determined, by C1q and conglutinin (K) assays, in 242 patients with acute hepatitis B and 60 healthy controls. CIC is a common feature of acute hepatitis B with 90.9% of cases having at least one abnormal test result. Patients with shorter interval (< 1 week) between onset of symptoms and patient presentation have significantly higher frequency of abnormal IgM class CIC, HBsAg-specific CIC, and higher frequency of raised alanine aminotransferase activity (> 30-fold upper limit of normal). The prevalence of raised alanine aminotransferase in patients with CIC containing HBsAg and IgM is higher than those without (P = 0.001). There is significant association between HBsAg-CIC and C1q-CIC. In conclusion, HBsAg-CIC and IgM class CIC correlate with disease activity. C1q-binding CIC is the predominant CIC that may play a role in the pathogenesis of acute hepatitis B."

In both years almost one quarter of the dental officers and half the other operating team members chose incorrect information about the methods of transmission of HIV. Several respondents named health care workers as belonging to a high risk group. Fever and loss of weight were known to be early symptoms of AIDS. In 1989, when asked to identify oral manifestations of HIV, one quarter of all the dental staff could not mention any of them. The findings of the study emphasise the need for urgent further education of dental teams in Tanzania."
78,0.003,3.0,"Despite the increasing prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease in the population and the increasing likelihood that HIV-positive (HIV+) patients may have an extraction, little is known about the risk of postoperative complications in this group. The goal of this investigation was to assess the risk of postoperative complications in HIV+ patients after tooth extraction. The study was designed as a retrospective cohort study with a sample consisting of 145 males who underwent tooth extraction. The patients' medical and dental records were reviewed to identify HIV serostatus, to document the frequency and type of postoperative complications, and to collect data on potential confounding variables. Forty-four patients were identified as HIV+. The postoperative complication rate in HIV+ patients was 20.9% and for HIV-negative (HIV-) patients 2.9% (relative risk = 7.0, 95% confidence interval = 2.0-25.0, P = 0.001). Furthermore, as the manifestations of the symptoms of HIV infection became more severe, the postextraction complication rate also increased (P = 0.008). The results of this study suggest that HIV+ patients have an increased risk of postextraction complications and as the level of HIV disease increases, the risk of complications also increases. While the findings of this study are consistent with studies based on case series, prospective cohort studies are required to confirm the findings."
2619,0.003,3.0,"The antiretroviral chemotherapy helps to reduce the mortality of HIVs infected patients. However, RNA dependant virus replication has a high mutation rate. Human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 protease plays an essential role in viral replication cycle. This protein is an important target for therapy with viral protein inhibitors. There are few works using normal mode analysis to investigate this problem from the structural changes viewpoint. The investigation of protein flexibility may be important for the study of processes associated with conformational changes and state transitions. The normal mode analysis allowed us to investigate structural changes in the protease (such as flexibility) in a straightforward way and try to associate these changes with the increase of fitness for each positively selected HIV-1 mutant protease of patients treated with several protease inhibitors (saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, fosamprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, and tripanavir) in combination or separately. These positively selected mutations introduce significant flexibility in important regions such as the active site cavity and flaps. These mutations were also able to cause changes in accessible solvent area. This study showed that the majority of HIV-1 protease mutants can be grouped into two main classes of protein flexibility behavior. We presented a new approach to study structural changes caused by positively selected mutations in a pathogen protein, for instance the HIV-1 protease and their relationship with their resistance mechanism against known inhibitors. The method can be applied to any pharmaceutically relevant pathogen proteins and could be very useful to understand the effects of positively selected mutations in the context of structural changes."
6699,0.003,3.0,"The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of demographic, clinical and psychosocial variables on health-related quality of life in women living with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Subjects included 82 women 18 years of age or older who were currently seeking treatment at an outpatient clinic. The Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 20 (SF-20) assessment consisted of patient self-ratings on 20 items measuring six distinct health dimensions. Additional data were collected on age, ethnicity, education, employment status, length of time since HIV diagnosis, CDC stage of disease, total CD4 count, number of symptoms, Karnofsky Performance Scores, social support and discrimination. Multiple regression analyses were performed using each of the six health dimension scores as dependent variables and a combination of ten demographic, clinical and psychosocial variables as independent variables. All of the six multiple regression equations were statistically significant, with R(2) values ranging from 0.35 to 0.44. Age, Karnofsky Performance Score and social support were statistically significantly related to several scale scores (p < 0.05). These results provide baseline data on clinical, demographic and psychosocial determinants of quality of life in a female patient population. Quality of life information can assist programme planners in developing social and medical service delivery for women in the community thus facilitating the development of treatments, programmes and interventions aimed at increasing quality of life for this population."
1355,0.003,3.0,"Non-adherence is one of the major causes of treatment failure which leads to increased morbidity and mortality caused by opportunistic infections. Optimal anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence is essential for maximal suppression of viral replication and long term survival of patients. In order to develop effective public health interventions in the context of scaling ART services to peripheral areas, it is important to evaluate factors associated with non-adherence among HIV-infected individuals in Pwani Region. The purpose of this study was to identify factors related to non-adherence to ART among HIV infected people in Pwani Region eastern of Tanzania. A case-control study was carried out at Tumbi Hospital and Chalinze Health Centre in Pwani Region in eastern Tanzania. A structured questionnaire was used to assess non-adherence and adherence to doses instruction and time schedule. Patients with less than 95% adherence were defined as cases while those with more than 95% adherence became controls. A structured questionnaire containing factors known to be associated with non-adherence to ART in similar settings was administered. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with non-adherence. A total of 79 cases and 237 controls matched by age and sex were studied. A high proportion of cases and controls (77.2% and 84.8%) had good knowledge ofART benefits, adherence and eligibility. Majority of cases (73.3%) and controls (69.2%) used public transport to access ART services. More than half of cases (53.2%) missed clinic appointments due to lack of bus fare or other reasons and was associated with ART non adherence (mOR 4.2, 95%CI, 2.2-8.1 and 2.1,95%CI 1.2-4.2). Disclosure to confidants only and failure to disclose HIV-test positive status were associated with non adherence (mOR 3.3, 95%CI 1.3-8.5 and 2.3, 95%CI 1.2-7.1). Alcohol use was associated with non adherence to ART (mOR 1.9, 95%CI 1.4-3.7). Patients who were not satisfied with providers were more likely to be non adherence to ART (mOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.2-3.8). In conclusion, these findings show that adherence is a process which is depended on local specific adherence factors. Adherence improvement strategies need to consider site specific adherence determinants, patient experiences and concerns."
2917,0.003,3.0,"Previous reports from India have been limited to the incidences of hepatitis B antigen (HB Ag) in health and disease. This paper reports on a study undertaken over the last two years to determine the incidence of hepatitis B virus infection, the serotypes prevalent among apparently healthy individuals and patients with liver diseases, and the seasonal incidence of sporadic acute hepatitis in this geographic area. The incidences of infection in health and disease show an endemic pattern. The Y subtype predominates among healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver diseases, whereas the D subtype predominates in patients with acute hepatitis. The similarity of subtypes of HB Ag among the majority of healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver diseases suggests that the majority of asymptomatic carriers (subclinically infected) would develop chronic liver disease. The proportion of HB Ag-positive cases of acute hepatitis was significantly higher during the two summer seasons than during the two winter seasons; this could be due to more frequent transmission of the virus by the faecal/urinary-oral route and its activation during the summer months, especially in areas with poor hygienic conditions. The urinary/faecal excretion of virus could thus maintain the natural transmission of the virus in such an environment."
5508,0.003,3.0,"About one-third of vertically HIV-1 infected infants develop AIDS within the first months of life; the remainder show slower disease progression. We investigated the relationship between the pattern of HIV-1 replication early in life and disease outcome in eleven infected infants sequentially studied from birth. Viral load in cells and plasma was measured by highly sensitive competitive PCR-based methods. Although all infants showed an increase in the indices of viral replication within their first weeks of life, three distinct patterns emerged: (a) a rapid increase in plasma viral RNA and cell-associated proviral DNA during the first 4-6 wk, reaching high steady state levels (> 1,000 HIV-1 copies/10(5) PBMC and > 1,000,000 RNA copies/ml plasma) within 2-3 mo of age; (b) a similar initial rapid increase in viral load, followed by a 2.5-50-fold decline in viral levels; (c) a significantly lower (> 10-fold) viral increase during the first 4-6 wk of age. All infants displaying the first pattern developed early AIDS, while infants with slower clinical progression exhibited the second or third pattern. These findings demonstrate that the pattern of viral replication and clearance in the first 2-3 mo of life is strictly correlated with, and predictive of disease evolution in vertically infected infants."
4629,0.003,3.0,"It has been well known that the transmission of HB virus is associated with mass inoculation and other medical procedures. In order to make clear the relation between HBV infection and the mass survey for filariasis on which sera of the examinees were drawn from their earlobes for the detecting of microfilaria with inadequately sterilized instruments, a epidemiological study was conducted in Miyako district. Okinawa prefecture, Japan, in which both HBV infection and filariasis were prevalent. A total of 2,231 inhabitants were investigated for HBV seromarkers. The over all positive rate of HBs antigen was 6.3% with the highest rate of 15.5% in the group of age 25 to 29. On the other hand, the prevalence rate of HBs antibody continued to increase along with age group, and remained to be over 60% after 30 years of age. The positive rates of both HBs antigen and antibody in the subject district were higher than those in other place of Okinawa prefecture or Japan. Comparing yearly attack rates of HBV chronologically, which were calculated from the age-specific HBV exposure rates in the district, the annual incidence of HBV infection was 6.1% (%/year) between 1954 to 1958, 5.2% (%/year) between 1959 to 1963, and then 4.4 (%/year) in the period of 1964 to 1968 in which the proportion of examinees for the survey of filariasis was the highest. In conclusion, the mass survey for filariasis was not the main factor contributing to the high prevalence of HBV infection in Miyako district."
4745,0.003,3.0,"The behavior of hepatitis C in states of immunodeficiency is poorly understood and it is still unclear whether the characteristics of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in renal transplant patients differ from those observed in immunocompetent subjects. The aim of this study was to compare the biochemical and histologic characteristics of chronic HCV infection between renal transplant and immunocompetent patients. Forty-one HCV-RNA-positive renal transplant patients and 41 immunocompetent controls matched for gender, age at infection and time of infection were included in the study. The groups were compared regarding laboratory and histologic variables. Renal transplant patients showed lower alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (p = 0.005) and higher levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase (p = 0.003), alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.001), and direct bilirubin (p < 0.001) when compared with controls. Histologic analysis revealed less intense portal (p < 0.001) and periportal (p = 0.046) inflammatory infiltrate in renal transplant patients but a larger proportion of cases with confluent necrosis (p = 0.043). No difference in the presence of septal fibrosis, hepatic steatosis, bile duct injury and siderosis was observed. However, there was a difference in the presence of lymphoid aggregates, which were less frequent in the renal transplant group (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the characteristics of hepatitis C in renal transplant patients differ from that observed in immunocompetent patients. In renal transplant patients, HCV infection is biochemically characterized by lower ALT levels and higher frequency of cholestasis. Regarding histology, despite lower frequency of lymphoid aggregates and less intense portal/periportal inflammatory infiltrate, a greater lobular damage was observed. The impact of these differences on the progression of fibrosis remains to be established."
9077,0.003,3.0,"Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are living longer, healthier lives on highly active antiretroviral therapy and, as a result, interest in kidney transplantation for HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease has increased. HIV is no longer considered a contraindication to solid-organ transplantation and the number of kidney transplants performed in HIV-infected patients each year is increasing steadily. HIV-infected kidney transplant recipients have had excellent outcomes overall, but there are still significant challenges, including high rates of acute rejection, drug-drug interactions, and poor outcomes in patients co-infected with hepatitis C virus. The gap between supply and demand for organs remains a challenge but new developments in HIV-positive to HIV-positive kidney transplantation may help bridge this gap."
7859,0.003,3.0,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has set a target of treating 3 million people with antiretroviral treatment (ART) by 2005. In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients could significantly contribute to this target. ART (stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine) was initiated in Thyolo district, Malawi, in April 2003, and all HIV-positive TB patients were considered eligible and offered ART. Despite this, only 44 (13%) of 352 TB patients were eventually started on ART by the end of November 2003. Most TB patients leave hospital after 2 weeks to complete the initial phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment (rifampicin-based) in the community, and ART is offered to HIV-positive TB patients after they have started the continuation phase of treatment (isoniazid/ ethambutol). ART is only offered at hospital, while the majority of TB patients take their continuation phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment from health centres. HIV-positive TB patients therefore find it difficult to access ART. In this paper, we discuss a series of options to increase the uptake of ART among HIV-positive TB patients. The main options are: 1) to hospitalise HIV-positive TB patients with a view to starting ART in the continuation phase in hospital; 2) to decentralise ART delivery so ART can be delivered at health centres; 3) to replace nevirapine with efavirenz so ART can be started earlier in the initial phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Decentralisation of ART from hospitals to health centres would greatly improve ART access."
406,0.003,3.0,"Increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) associated with HIV-1 infection is primarily attributed to deficient T helper (Th)1 immune responses, but most people with active TB have robust Th1 responses, indicating that these are not sufficient to protect against disease. Recent findings suggest that favourable outcomes following Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection arise from finely balanced inflammatory and regulatory pathways, achieving pathogen control without immunopathology. We hypothesised that HIV-1 and antiretroviral therapy (ART) exert widespread changes to cell mediated immunity, which may compromise the optimal host protective response to TB and provide novel insights into the correlates of immune protection and pathogenesis. We sought to define these effects in patients with active TB by transcriptional profiling of tuberculin skin tests (TST) to make comprehensive molecular level assessments of in vivo human immune responses at the site of a standardised mycobacterial challenge. We showed that the TST transcriptome accurately reflects the molecular pathology at the site of human pulmonary TB, and used this approach to investigate immune dysregulation in HIV-1/TB co-infected patients with distinct clinical phenotypes associated with TST reactivity or anergy and unmasking TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after initiation of ART. HIV-1 infected patients with positive TSTs exhibited preserved Th1 responses but deficient immunoregulatory IL10-inducible responses. Those with clinically negative TSTs revealed profound anergy of innate as well as adaptive immune responses, except for preservation of type 1 interferon activity, implicated in impaired anti-mycobacterial immunity. Patients with unmasking TB IRIS showed recovery of Th1 immunity to normal levels, but exaggerated Th2-associated responses specifically. These mechanisms of immune dysregulation were localised to the tissue microenvironment and not evident in peripheral blood. TST molecular profiling categorised different mechanisms of immunological dysfunction in HIV-1 infection beyond the effects on CD4 T cells, each associated with increased risk of TB disease and amenable to host-directed therapies.

1405,0.003,3.0,"We isolated two template analog reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor-resistant mutants of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 RT by using the DNA aptamer, RT1t49. The mutations associated, N255D or N265D, displayed low-level resistance to RT1t49, while high-level resistance could be observed when both mutations were present (Dbl). Molecular clones of HIV that contained the mutations produced replication-defective virions. All three RT mutants displayed severe processivity defects. Thus, while biochemical resistance to the DNA aptamer RT1t49 can be generated in vitro via multiple mutations, the overlap between the aptamer- and template-primer-binding pockets favors mutations that also affect the RT-template-primer interaction. Therefore, viruses with such mutations are replication defective. Potent inhibition and a built-in mechanism to render aptamer-resistant viruses replication defective make this an attractive class of inhibitors."
866,0.003,3.0,"Viral Hepatitis is one of the leading causes of disease around the world. In Latin America is a severe public health problem. We conducted a case-control study in the Cayetano Heredia Hospital, Lima-Perú, seeking for risk factors for Hepatitis B infection. We found 0.41% of frequency of HBsAg and 8.13% of anti-HBs in the 492 persons screened. Contact with blood was confirmed as a risk factor for Hepatitis B infection; disposable needle-wash was also identified as a major risk factor. The personnel of the Sterilization Room is also in high risk for the infection. The nurse-aid personnel was also identified as a high risk group. We suggest that the needle wash is a risk factor very easy to remove, and also stopping the rotation of the auxiliary personnel could reduce the incidence of the infection in the personnel at risk."
9885,0.003,3.0,"Although recent data have supported the role of heterosexual activity in the transmission of hepatitis B virus infection in women, studies generating these data have enrolled few black women. We therefore examined black female participants attending our local health department's sexually transmitted disease clinic for the treatment of presumed uncomplicated gonorrhea in serologic and risk-factor surveys of hepatitis B virus infection. Twenty-four (17.6%) of 136 subjects tested had evidence of prior hepatitis B infection. Serologic evidence of hepatitis B infection was significantly associated with three different barometers of sexual activity that included: (1) years of sexual activity (P less than 0.005); (2) history of sexually transmitted disease (P less than 0.02); and (3) number of lifetime heterosexual partners (P less than 0.001). These data provide further support that the quantity of sexual exposure seems to be an important risk factor for hepatitis B infection in heterosexually active females."

Only limited information about the epidemiology of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection especially in females is available. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies and the possible factors for transmission in the female population of a largely urban city Islamabad. A cross sectional study was conducted from May 2006 to August 2006 in Islamabad. We select 252 female households (n=252) following the selection criteria. The primary outcome variables were HCV seropositivity and factors like history of major surgical procedure, blood transfusion, Intravenous drug use etc. The results showed mean age of the sample was 33.21 (±9.95) years and HCV seropositivity was present in 62 (24.6%) females. Final Forward Stepwise multiple logistic regression showed blood transfusion [OR, 10.094 95% CI 1.950-52.257], dental procedure [OR, 5.381 95% CI 2.315-12.507] and dilation and curettage [OR, 3.869 95% 1.867-8.015] were significantly associated with HCV seropositivity in females.

5547,0.003,3.0,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface small antigen (HBsAg) self-assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs). HBsAg-based VLPs constitute a powerful vector for heterologous immunogenic peptides to develop a safe vaccine delivery system. HBV and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are frequently associated in infection. An HIV-1 class I polyepitope was designed for an HIV-1/HBV vaccine prototype based on HBsAg VLPs. Invariable peptides from the original HIV-1 polyepitope were here permutated to study the influence of epitope order on HIV-1/HBV VLP immunogenicity. Anti-HIV-1 cellular responses were statistically comparable among polyepitope variants. Nevertheless, delivered HIV-1 polyepitopes impacted anti-HBsAg carrier immunogenicity in a polyepitope-specific manner. For a given set of epitopes, the choice of epitope order in polyepitopes is strategic to control immune responses towards HBsAg VLPs used as carrier of foreign immunogenic peptides."

6331,0.003,3.0,"There are few data on drug resistance-associated mutations in the former Soviet Union since, studies have usually been focused on the env or gag genes for subtype information. This study examines the prevalence and patterns of resistance-associated mutations to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors (RTI, PRI) in 278 HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve subjects from countries of Eastern Europe, and defines characteristic polymorphisms of RT and PR sequences in HIV-1 subtype A viruses. Blood samples were collected between 1997 and 2004. Plasma RNA was used for PR-RT amplification by reverse transcription coupled with nested PCR and sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis was done with neighbor-joining trees and bootscanning. Analysis of drug resistance mutations, with Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database's algorithm, resulted in an overall prevalence of 12.9% resistance to RTI and 3.9% to PRI. The most frequent substitutions in the RT region were at positions 62 and 236. V77I substitution in PR was found in 47.8% of samples. Polymorphisms in subtype A sequences were identified. This is the first study reporting the prevalence and patterns of both PRI and RTI resistance-associated mutations in naïve HIV-1 infected patients from the former Soviet Union. These data underline the importance of genotypic resistance testing of chronically HIV-1-infected patients before initiating treatment, in order to select the most suitable drug regimen."

This study aimed to determine the relationship between public perception about HIV/AIDS and discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA . The present study was conducted using a descriptive and survey design. Data were collected from 450 patients (236 male and 214 female) in Tehran and Yazd cities. The research instruments were modified HIV-related knowledge/attitude and perception questions about PLWHA, and discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA. The results showed that prevalence of discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA in the studied population was 60.0%. There was a significant negative correlation between citizens' awareness about HIV/AIDS, HIV-related attitudes, negative perception toward people with HIV/AIDS symptoms and their discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA (p < .01). The hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that components of public perception about HIV/AIDS explained for 23.7% of the variance of discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA. Negative public perceptions about HIV/AIDS in Iran associated with discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA and cultural beliefs in Iran tend to stigmatize and discriminate against the LWHA. "
8353,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) variants were selected for resistance to the (+) and (-) enantiomers of a novel nucleoside analogue, 2'-deoxy-3'-oxa-4'-thio-5-fluorocytidine (dOTFC), by use of the infectious molecular clone HIV HXB2D and the human T-cell line MT-4. The dOTFC-resistant variants that were selected were 10-fold less sensitive than wild-type virus, and cloning and sequencing of the complete reverse transcriptase (RT)-coding region identified the mutation M184V. Studies with mutated recombinant HXB2D virus confirmed the importance of the M184V mutation in conferring resistance to (-)dOTFC in MT-4 cells, although no difference in sensitivity was observed in primary cells. The M184V substitution also displayed decreased susceptibility to (+)dOTFC. Selection with (+)dOTFC also produced variants which were 10-fold more resistant than the wild type, and a novel mutation, D67G, was identified following cloning and sequencing of the RT genes. The D67G mutation was introduced into HXB2D by site-directed mutagenesis, and the data obtained confirmed the importance of this mutation in conferring resistance to both (+)dOTFC and (-)dOTFC. Mutated recombinant molecular clone HXB2D-D67G was further selected with (+)dOTFC, and three of six clones sequenced contained both the D67G and M184V mutations, while the other three of the six clones contained only the D67G mutation. Clinical isolates of HIV-1 which are (-) 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine-resistant also displayed resistance to both (+)dOTFC and (-)dOTFC."
1289,0.003,3.0,"Anti-hepatitis Be (HBe) carriers are perceived as having low infectivity, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels far below those seen in the HBeAg carrier. However, the temporal stability of HBV DNA in anti-HBe carriers remains poorly characterised. UK Department of Health guidelines use HBV DNA levels to define whether HBV-infected health care workers may perform exposure-prone procedures. Two samples separated by 1-23 years available from 147 carriers were analysed for precore variants and HBV DNA levels. Among 15 HBeAg carriers, HBV DNA was maintained at high levels. There was a 5 log(10) fold reduction in DNA in 11 individuals who developed anti-HBe during follow-up evaluation. Proportional changes in HBV DNA levels in anti-HBe carriers were similar to those in HBeAg carriers, although there was a trend for changes in viral DNA to be more marked in anti-HBe carriers followed up for longer periods. Closer sampling in 20 anti-HBe carriers demonstrated large fluctuations of DNA levels over short periods. Serum transaminases and precore mutant status at the outset failed to predict those in whom HBV DNA levels fluctuated. HBV DNA was below the detection threshold (<400 copies/ml) in 36 anti-HBe carriers at first sampling and remained so in all but 5 of these carriers. Twelve individuals who were previously viraemic lost detectable HBV DNA during follow-up evaluation. While HBV DNA levels are found to fluctuate in carriers, our results indicate that once below the threshold of detectability, levels are unlikely to rise. This is an important factor when assessing health care workers for exposure-prone procedures."
757,0.003,3.0,"A prospective, cross-sectional study was designed to determine the magnetic resonance relaxation times of cerebral white matter in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. T1 and T2 were estimated at 1.5 T using four-point methods. Seventy-five HIV-1 seropositive subjects, 48 seronegative blood donors, and 17 seronegative homosexual men were studied. Associations between relaxometry and clinical classification, neurological status, immunological status, and qualitative MRI were investigated. Statistically significant differences in white matter T1 relaxation time were found comparing low-risk control and AIDS groups (p < .005), seropositive subjects with neurological signs and those without (p < .005), and subjects with low (CD4 < or = 200 x 10(6)/l) and high (CD4 > 200 x 10(6)/1) CD4 cell counts (p < .05). These findings add to the body of information that reveals no HIV-related change in the brain before the onset of symptomatic immunosuppression and go someway to validating the previous visually rated, qualitative findings. Statistically significant difference in white matter T2 relaxation time were also found comparing the two control groups (p < .005) highlighting the need for appropriate controls."
4246,0.003,3.0,"A panel of 28 insertion mutants of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag precursor (Pr55Gag) was constructed by linker-insertion mutagenesis and expressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells. One set of 14 mutants carried the normal N-myristylation signal; the other set constituted their non-N-myristylated counterparts. The mutants were characterized with respect to (i) assembly and extracellular release of membrane-enveloped budding Gag particles, (ii) intracellular assembly and nuclear transport of Gag cores, (iii) specific processing of Pr55Gag by HIV-1 protease in vivo, and (iv) binding of Pr55Gag to an HIV-1 genomic RNA probe in Northwestern blotting. Insertions within the region between amino acid residues 209 and 334 in the CA domain appeared to be the most detrimental to Gag particle assembly and release of Gag into the external medium, whereas a narrower window, between residues 209 and 241, was found to be critical for secretion of soluble Pr55Gag. Differences in Pr55Gag processing in vivo and RNA binding in vitro between N-myristylated and non-N-myristylated Gag mutants suggested a major conformational role for the myristylated N terminus of Gag precursor. In coinfection experiments using wild-type Gag- and mutant Gag-expressing recombinants, a transdominant negative effect on Gag particle assembly and release was observed for insertions located in two separate domains, the matrix and nucleocapsid."

1908,0.003,3.0,"The goal of the study was to improve the methodology of HIV genotyping for analysis of HIV drug resistance and HIV clustering. Using the protocol of Gall et al. (A. Gall, B. Ferns, C. Morris, S. Watson, M. Cotten, M. Robinson, N. Berry, D. Pillay, and P. Kellam, J Clin Microbiol 50:3838-3844, 2012, doi:10.1128/JCM.01516-12), we developed a robust methodology for amplification of two large fragments of viral genome covering about 80% of the unique HIV-1 genome sequence. Importantly, this method can be applied to both viral RNA and proviral DNA amplification templates, allowing genotyping in HIV-infected subjects with suppressed viral loads (e.g., subjects on antiretroviral therapy [ART]). The two amplicons cover critical regions across the HIV-1 genome (including pol and env), allowing analysis of mutations associated with resistance to protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs]), integrase strand transfer inhibitors, and virus entry inhibitors. The two amplicons generated span 7,124 bp, providing substantial sequence length and numbers of informative sites for comprehensive phylogenic analysis and greater refinement of viral linkage analyses in HIV prevention studies. The long-range HIV genotyping from proviral DNA was successful in about 90% of 212 targeted blood specimens collected in a cohort where the majority of patients had suppressed viral loads, including 65% of patients with undetectable levels of HIV-1 RNA loads. The generated amplicons could be sequenced by different methods, such as population Sanger sequencing, single-genome sequencing, or next-generation ultradeep sequencing. The developed method is cost-effective-the cost of the long-range HIV genotyping is under $140 per subject (by Sanger sequencing)-and has the potential to enable the scale up of public health HIV prevention interventions.

5351,0.003,3.0,"Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 316 was an international, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial comparing single-dose oral nevirapine (200 mg to mother and 2 mg/kg to infant) with placebo in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women receiving standard antiretroviral therapy. This substudy evaluated the emergence of nevirapine-resistance mutations at 6 weeks postpartum in a subgroup of participants. Maternal risk factors for the emergence of nevirapine-resistance mutations were evaluated. Mutations associated with nevirapine resistance were detectable at delivery, prior to receipt of study drug, in 5 (2.3%) of 217 women. Fourteen (15%; 95% confidence interval, 8%-23%) of 95 women who received intrapartum nevirapine developed a nevirapine-resistance mutation 6 weeks postpartum. The most common mutation was K103N, which was present in 10 women. The risk for development of a new nevirapine-resistance mutation did not correlate with CD4 cell count or HIV-1 RNA load at delivery or with type of antepartum antiretroviral therapy. The risk of nevirapine resistance should be considered when determining the risks or benefits of intrapartum nevirapine in women receiving antepartum antiretroviral therapy."

4454,0.003,3.0,"Liver fibrosis is common, particularly in individuals who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV-infected individuals have excess congestive heart failure (CHF) risk compared with uninfected people. It remains unknown whether liver fibrosis stage influences the CHF risk or if HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection modifies this association. Our objectives were to assess whether 1) stage of liver fibrosis is independently associated with incident CHF and 2) the association between stage of liver fibrosis and incident CHF is modified by HIV/HCV status. Participants alive on or after April 1, 2003, in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study were included. Those without prevalent cardiovascular disease were followed until their first CHF event, death, last follow-up date, or December 31, 2011. Liver fibrosis was measured using the fibrosis 4 index (FIB-4), which is calculated using age, aminotransferases, and platelets. Cox proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors. Among 96,373 participants over 6.9 years, 3844 incident CHF events occurred. FIB-4 between 1.45 and 3.25 (moderate fibrosis) and FIB-4 > 3.25 (advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis) were associated with CHF (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.17 [1.07-1.27] and 1.65 [1.43-1.92], respectively).

Only limited information is available on the outcome of coinfected patients after liver transplantation. We studied survival rates of 204 patients with viral hepatitis transplanted at our center between 1972 and 1997. HBV/HDV and HBV/HCV coinfections were present in 23 and nine individuals, respectively, while 97 patients had monoinfection by HCV and 75 had HBV monoinfection. Survival of coinfected patients was significantly longer than that of monoinfected patients (14.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 8.5 +/- 0.6 yr; p = 0.0003). The same was true for graft survival (p = 0.0002). In Cox's regression, viral coinfection (p = 0.0001), absence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (p = 0.00001) and no retransplantation (p = 0.02) were independently associated with patient survival. After exclusion of patients with HCC (n = 62), survival of coinfected patients was still significantly longer than that of monoinfected individuals (p = 0.002). The improved outcome was similar for both HBV/HDV and HBV/HCV coinfections. In contrast to immunocompetent patients, individuals with multiple hepatitis virus infections had an improved outcome after liver transplantation. Thus, viral coinfections may be associated with ameliorated courses of diseases under certain conditions."

To establish the prevalence of HDV infection in haemophilic patients and patients without haemophilia, 87 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were examined for serological evidence of delta hepatitis. In addition HBV, HDV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection markers were compared to clinical and histopathological outcome of hepatitis. Out of 46 haemophiliacs 30 (65%) were anti-HD-seropositive; 10 out of 30 anti-HD-positive patients (33%) had pathological liver function tests compared to 2 out of 16 anti-HD-negative haemophiliacs (13%). The rate of HIV infection did not differ between the HDV infected and the non-HDV infected individuals with haemophilia (17/27 anti-HD-positive patients versus 12/16 anti-HD-negative patients). Two haemophilic anti-HD-positive patients underwent liver biopsy, in both cases hepatitis D antigen (HDAg) was detected in the biopsies. Only 2 out of 41 patients without haemophilia were anti-HD-positive. Both had pathological liver function tests; chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis, respectively, were diagnosed and HDAg was found in the liver biopsies. Out of 39 anti-HD-seronegative patients without haemophilia, 26 (67%) were hepatitis B e antigen positive; in the sera of 20 patients (51%) HBV-DNA was demonstrated, but only 6 patients (15%) had pathological liver function tests. In conclusion a high seroprevalence of HDV infection was found in haemophilic patients treated with non-pasteurized commercial clotting factor concentrates. An endemic spreading of HDV infection in patients without haemophilia with chronic HBV infection could not be detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5484,0.003,3.0,"Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a known complication during and after anti-cancer therapy. This condition can affect two patient populations: it is most commonly seen in patients who are seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but it is also being increasingly reported among patients who are HBsAg-negative but who have prior infection, as evident by seropositive status for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), irrespective of their anti-HBs (antibody to HBsAg) status. The clinical course can vary from asymptomatic hepatitis to fulminant hepatic failure that can be potentially fatal. With the increasing use of biological agents in addition to potent cytotoxic chemotherapy in the armamentarium of anti-cancer treatments, reactivation of hepatitis B has become a common clinical situation that is faced by both oncologists and hepatologists especially in HBV endemic areas. In this review, we discuss the clinical course of reactivation in the two HBV-infected sub-populations, and the role of anti-virals in the prevention and management of HBV reactivation in association with cytotoxic chemotherapy and biological therapies."
4554,0.003,3.0,"Analysis of the preS1 gene of hepatitis B virus was used to define two nosocomial outbreaks of HBV infection. In an outbreak in an oncology unit we had previously shown by single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of a 189 bp fragment of the preS1 gene, that 52 children were infected with HBV strains that displayed only 5 different SSCP profiles. Sequencing of a 383 bp fragment encompassing the entire preS1 gene, revealed that isolates with same SSCP profile were identical in sequence across the entire preS1 gene, confirming that those patients with the same SSCP pattern had epidemiologically linked infections. A second outbreak involved 8 liver transplant patients from two different hospitals, 5 of whom were from the same hospital at which the oncology outbreak had occurred. Two of these 5 patients had HBV strains that were identical to strains from the oncology unit and nosocomial transmission probably accounted for the infections in these two, while diversity of both SSCP profiles and sequence data of remaining 6 patients supported the conclusion that they had not been infected from a common source. The donor liver is believed to be the most likely source of infection in these patients. HBV isolates from patients infected in the community were used as a standard for the general degree of preS1 sequence variation of local HBV strains. Phylogenetic analysis and comparison with reference HBV clones revealed that of 27 local HBV strains, genotypes A and D occurred most frequently and were identified in 14 and 12 patients respectively, while genotype C was detected in one patient."

Nine had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Travel to the United States, homosexual relations with United States nationals in Panama, and sexual contacts in Panamanian clubs and bars were associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection by logistic regression analysis. Number of different male sex partners per year was identified but did not enter the logistic model at a significant level. To estimate seroprevalence in other high risk populations, 183 Panama City female prostitutes and 55 homosexual males from the rural Azuero peninsula were screened; none were seropositive.

No evidence of liver enzyme elevations were seen, even in 66 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection. Given that TDF is an adenosine analogue, like didanosine, exposure to ribavirin might increase intracellular phosphorylated TDF metabolites, which could result in a higher risk of nephrotoxicity.

To examine this issue, we studied 50 NANB FHF patients and 104 liver transplant recipients from North America and Europe. Hepatic DNA was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus I (HSV I) and II (HSV II), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) nucleic acid sequences. The prevalence of HBV was assessed in North American subjects only. HSV I, HSV II, VZV, and HHV-6 viral sequences were not observed in any samples. Three of 50 FHF (6%) and 14 of 104 control patients (13%) were positive for CMV DNA. Two of 50 FHF (4%) and 10 of 104 control patients (10%) had EBV DNA, and HBV DNA was observed in 3 of 10 North American FHF patients (30%) and 3 of 59 controls (5%) without serum markers for HBV infection. The finding of HBV DNA in the liver of seronegative controls from North America but not Europe suggests that occult hepatitis B sequences in patients with NANB FHF may simply reflect geographic differences. The majority of cryptogenic FHF cases cannot be attributed to infection with herpes viruses or HBV."
1761,0.003,3.0,"The sera from 16 individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at different clinical stages were evaluated for antibody-dependent neutralization and/or enhancement of infectivity by HIV. The HIV isolate from each individual (homotypic) and established laboratory strains showing broad cellular host range and cytopathicity were used. All sera could neutralize one of the laboratory-passaged isolates, whereas only two could neutralize the corresponding homotypic strain. Seven homotypic isolates were enhanced by serum from the respective individual. This activity was primarily observed in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Moreover, the tropism for macrophages of four of these seven viral isolates was found to be enhanced by the homotypic sera. Finally, sequential pairs of HIV and sera obtained from five HIV-infected individuals with different clinical progression were studied over time. The enhancing activity of three of the five sera appeared to increase over time, indicating changes in both the host virus population and the type of antibodies produced. These results suggest that enhancing antibodies contribute to the spread and pathogenesis of HIV in vivo. They emphasize the necessity of studying further the association of enhancing antibodies and disease progression in infected individuals."

We report a 28-year-old woman who presented with Candida oesophagitis with underlying chronic hepatitis C. The patient presented with anorexia and weakness and was noted to have raised serum transaminases. Upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed Candida oesophagitis involving the whole oesophagus. Oesophageal biopsy demonstrated changes consistent with Candida oesophagitis. Serology was positive for hepatitis C antibodies, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyped hepatitis C virus (HCV) as genotype 3. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis with moderately active portal inflammation. A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test was non-reactive for types 1 and 2. The development of Candida oesophagitis in a patient with chronic HCV infection demands prompt consideration of general debility and immunosuppression as effects of HCV that led to an occurrence of opportunistic infection. Evaluation of this case provides insight into various mechanisms of immune suppression associated with HCV infection."

Although HIV co-infection clearly accelerates progression of HCV-related fibrosis and liver disease, controversy remains as to the impact of HCV on HIV disease progression in co-infected patients. HIV can cause immune dysfunction, in which the regulatory function of T helper (Th) cells is very essential. Moreover, cytokines derived from Th cells play a prominent role in viral infection. Investigating the functional changes of Th1 and Th2 cells in cytokine level can improve the understanding of the effect of co-infected HCV on HIV infection."

Statistical analysis of the case studies shows 120/cumm median CD4+ blood cell count, and the OIs showed an inversely proportional occurrence to the CD4+ count of the immunocompromised patients. The spectrum and frequency of certain OIs highlight the urgency of studying HIV/AIDS in resource-limited countries where locally specific disease patterns may be observed. The purpose of the present investigation was the identification of such opportunistic pathogens, as we feel the HIV epidemic can be more effectively managed if physicians and health planners are aware of this information."
1631,0.003,3.0,"Apathy is a prominent neuropsychiatric symptom associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The increased frequency of apathy in this population may reflect the direct involvement of the virus on the central nervous system (CNS), but the severity of apathy has not been shown to consistently relate to markers of disease activity or other neuropsychiatric complications of the virus. We examined the relationship between ratings of apathy and performance on measures of cognitive function and immune system status in a sample of HIV-infected patients. Apathy was significantly elevated among HIV-infected individuals compared to healthy comparison subjects. Apathy was significantly related to performance on measures of learning efficiency and a measure of cognitive flexibility. Ratings of apathy did not relate to CD4 cell count, but they were associated with disease duration. In addition, ratings of depression were independent of ratings of apathy. These findings suggest that apathy does not co-vary with a proxy measure of active disease status, but apathy does relate to several measures of cognitive dysfunction in patients with HIV. As such, the increased prevalence of apathy among HIV-infected adults may reflect HIV-associated neurologic dysfunction."
9104,0.003,3.0,"Monocytes and brain macrophage-microglial cells are thought to play a crucial role in the neurologic dysfunction associated with HIV-1 disease. Since neopterin is produced by monocytes-macrophages, we asked whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neopterin levels increase before the onset of HIV-1 neurologic disease and whether they correlate with other CSF and peripheral blood immunologic parameters. In this study, CSF neopterin levels from 159 neurologically asymptomatic HIV-positive persons were found to increase as the blood CD4+ T-cell count decreased and as CSF IgG, IgG synthesis, IgG index, and beta 2-microglobulin increased. Neopterin levels in the CSF exceeded those in the serum in 32% of patients, while 25% had CSF levels > 13.5 nmol/liter. CSF neopterin levels vary with immune status, may reflect intrathecal production, and can be elevated in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients with normal neurologic examinations. Long-term follow-up of this patient population should be able to define the clinical correlation between CSF neopterin levels during the asymptomatic phase of HIV-1 disease and the risk of subsequent neurologic disease."
9894,0.003,3.0,"Antiretroviral therapy has dramatically reduced mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In 1988, the suggestion that the first antiretroviral drug, zidovudine, was the potential cause of muscle pathology in HIV-infected persons resulted in structural and biochemical patient studies demonstrating acquired mitochondrial dysfunction. Assessment of subsequent nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) antiretroviral drugs has indicated that mitochondria are a common target of NRTI toxicity in multiple tissues, leading to a wide variety of pathology ranging from lipodystrophy to neuropathy. Overwhelmingly, these complications have emerged during post-licensing human studies. Subsequent animal and in vitro studies have then elucidated the potential pathological mechanisms, suggesting that NRTI-associated mitochondrial toxicity arises principally from inhibition of the sole mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma, leading to a reduction in mtDNA content (depletion). Millions of patients have been treated with mitochondrially toxic NRTIs and these drugs remain the backbone of antiretroviral rollout in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Here we describe the 25-year history of antiretroviral associated mitochondrial pathology and critically review the strength of evidence linking clinical, histopathological, and molecular data. We discuss recently described novel mechanisms of NRTI-associated mitochondrial damage and whether or not recently licensed NRTIs may be considered free from mitochondrial toxicity. "
2898,0.003,3.0,"It was demonstrated that combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) reduces the HIV-1 viral load (VL) in the blood and the seminal compartment. Some studies have reported that the seminal HIV-1 VL is undetectable in individuals with an undetectable blood plasma viral load (bpVL) under cART. However, some recent studies have demonstrated that seminal HIV-1 RNA may still be detected, and potentially infectious, even in the case of an undetectable bpVL. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the detection rate of a seminal VL and whether shedding could be intermittent over a very short time. From January 2006 to December 2011, 88 HIV-1 infected men, enrolled in an Assisted Reproduction program, provided 306 semen samples, corresponding to 177 frozen sperm samples (two samples delivered at a one-hour interval (n = 129) or one sample (n = 48)). All enrolled men were under cART, with an undetectable bpVL for more than 6 months. HIV-1 RNA was quantified in seminal plasma using a Roche COBAS Ampliprep COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 test. Seminal HIV-1 RNA was detected in 23 samples (7.5%) from 17 patients (19.3%). This detection rate was stable over years. With regards to the freezing of two samples delivered at a one-hour interval, the proportion of discordance between the first and second samples was 9.3% (12/129). Our results confirm the intermittent shedding of HIV-1 in semen. While this finding has been shown by studies examining longer time intervals, to our knowledge, this has never been demonstrated over such a short time interval. "

Its action on natural killer (NK) cell activity has not yet been studied in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In the present study, the in vitro and in vivo effects of the drug on NK cell activity have been determined in six patients with chronic HBV hepatitis and in ten healthy control subjects. Two methods were used: an enzyme release assay and a cytotoxicity test based on the assessment of endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity of the target cells. The in vitro effect of the drug was assessed using cianidanol at 10(-6), 10(-5) and 10(-4) M concentrations. For in vivo studies, HBV hepatitis patients were treated with cianidanol at a daily dose of 3.0 g cianidanol for seven days and were investigated before and after the treatment. Chronic HBV hepatitis patients showed a moderate decrease in NK cell activity compared to the controls, but after the cianidanol therapy their NK cell activity significantly rose to 68.0% +/- 9.5% (p less than 0.01). Cianidanol in vitro inhibited the NK cell activity both in hepatitis and healthy groups when using K-562 target cells and the lactic acid dehydrogenase enzyme release assay, but did not influence or even slightly enhance the NK activity when human embryonic fibroblast cells and alkaline phosphatase assay were used for the test. After the 7-day in vivo treatment, the in vitro inhibitory action of the drug was diminished or absent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
4542,0.003,3.0,"One hundred sequences of HIV-1 protease with the two flanking cleavage sites from 10 antiretroviral drug-treated Thai patients were examined for residue variability and for mutations at positions associated with the resistance to protease inhibitors. Seven patients were infected with CRF01_AE, two with subtype B, and one with a strain that did not belong to any of the currently identified subtypes or recombinant forms. A total of 46 out of the 99 positions (46%) in HIV-1 protease showed at least one amino acid change as compared with the HXB2 subtype B protease. Interestingly, 35% of these mutations were at positions associated with resistance to the PIs. The observation indicated that the viral protease is flexible in tolerating some degree of amino acid substitutions even in the critical regions under the selective pressure driven by antiretroviral drugs. The PR/RT cleavage site revealed conservation of the HXB2 sequence. Nevertheless, the p6*/PR cleavage site displayed variability, notably in the p6* region."

The recognition of the HLA-DQ-restricted epitope by this clone was further defined by using overlapping synthetic peptides. The epitope recognized by this CD4+ CTL clone (amino acids 140 to 148) overlaps with a CD8+ epitope and is highly conserved among all isolates of HIV type 1 that have been sequenced.

9585,0.003,3.0,"Approximately 350 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), representing a significant public health challenge. Nucleos/tide analogues (NUCs) and interferon alpha (IFNα), the current standard of care for chronic infection, aim at preventing progression of the disease to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and death. However, in contrast to the case of hepatitis C virus infection, in which novel antiviral drugs cure the vast majority of treated patients, in regard to HBV, cure is rare due to the unusual persistence of viral DNA in the form of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) within the nucleus of infected cells. Available therapies for HBV require lifelong treatment and surveillance, as reactivation frequently occurs following medication cessation and the occurrence of HCC is decreased but not eliminated, even after years of successful viral suppression. Progress has been made in the development of new therapeutics, and it is likely that only a combination of immune modulators, inhibitors of gene expression and replication and cccDNA-targeting drugs will eradicate chronic infection. This review aims to summarize the state of the art in HBV drug research highlighting those agents with the greatest potential for success based on in vitro as well as on data from clinical studies."
4468,0.003,3.0,"The importance of CD8+ T-cell responses in the control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection has been demonstrated, yet few studies have been able to correlate these responses with markers of HIV-1 disease progression. This study measured cell-mediated immune responses using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from 27 patients with chronic HIV-1 infection, the majority of whom were off antiretroviral therapy. The ELISPOT assay was used to detect gamma interferon-secreting PBMC after stimulation with overlapping HIV-1 peptides spanning the Gag, Pol, Env, and Nef proteins in addition to the baculovirus-derived p24 and gp160 proteins. All volunteers had responses to at least one HIV-1-specific peptide. All but one of the subjects (96%) responded to the Gag peptide pool, and 86% responded to the Pol and/or Nef peptide pools. The magnitude and the breadth of T-cell responses directed to either the Gag or p24 peptide pools correlated inversely with viral load in plasma (r = -0.60, P < 0.001 and r = -0.52, P < 0.005, respectively) and directly with absolute CD4+ T-cell counts (r = 0.54, P < 0.01 and r = 0.39, P < 0.05, respectively) using the Spearman rank correlation test. Responses to the Pol and integrase peptide pools also correlated with absolute CD4+ T-cell counts (r = 0.45, P < 0.05 and r = 0.49, P < 0.01, respectively). No correlation with markers of disease progression was seen with specific T-cell responses directed toward the Env or Nef peptides. These data serve as strong evidence that major histocompatibility complex class I presentation of Gag peptides is an essential feature for any HIV-1 vaccine designed to elicit optimal CD8+ T-cell responses."
8686,0.003,3.0,"Isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) derived from the central nervous system (CNS) display properties distinctive from blood-derived isolates, including a high incidence of macrophage tropism in CNS isolates. Macrophage tropism is a result, in part, of DNA sequence variation in the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gene, but evidence also exists suggesting differences in the long terminal repeat (LTR) may contribute to differential gene expression. To investigate the nature of HIV-1 LTR sequence variation in the brain, we have sequenced bases -374 to +43 of the LTR from the brains of four HIV-1-infected patients. A total of 56 clones were derived from either both gray and white matter (three brains) or white matter alone (one brain), and these sequences were compared to 17 published sequences derived from multiple sources. A total of five LTR quasispecies were found. Overall, there was a significant amount of sequence variation both within and between brains, comparable to that seen in quasispecies of the envelope glycoprotein derived from blood or brain. The vast majority of the variation was seen in regions upstream from the two NF-kappa B sites. Compared to the blood-derived, T cell-tropic IIIB LTR, a majority of clones from two or more of the brains shared 11 unique substitutions in transcription factor binding sites, of which eight were shared with the CNS-derived clones JR-CSF and JR-FL and altered the NF-AT and LEF-1 transcription factor binding sites. These findings correlate with published functional studies showing CNS-derived HIV-1 LTRs are distinct from the blood-derived IIIB LTR, and represent a starting point for future studies designed to determine which LTR sequence variations are associated with cell-specific differences in gene expression in the CNS."
5101,0.003,3.0,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs12979860 and rs8099917 near the interleukin 28B gene are predictors of virological response (SVR) to IFN-based therapy for monoinfected chronic hepatitis C patients. We retrospectively evaluated the impact of IL28B SNPs and other factors on SVR in a cohort of 102 HIV-1/HCV-coinfected patients treated with pegylated interferon-? (peg-INF?) and ribavirin. Data on baseline features and virological response at different time-points were collected. Overall, 89/102 patients (87%) were males, 44 (43%) of whom infected with HCV genotype 1; SVR was achieved by 50 patients (49%). A univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that rs129679860 SNP genotype CC (p<0.034), rs8099917 SNP genotype TT (p<0.01), HCV genotype 2 or 3 (p<0.0001), low HCV viral load (p<0.028) and RVR (rapid virological response) (p<0.0001) were associated with a higher likelihood of SVR. Multivariate analysis confirmed only RVR and HCV genotype as independent predictors of SVR. In a real life setting, the importance of RVR and IL28B SNPs was confirmed as predictive of SVR to identify patients with a higher likelihood of SVR to Peg-INF?+RBV, and also to designate a deferred therapy for patients with a low likelihood of SVR for whom it is preferable to wait for more successful options.

8095,0.003,3.0,"Splenectomy has been reported to alter inconsistently the CD4 lymphocyte numbers in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To further assess the effect of splenectomy we have retrospectively examined the charts of 10 patients who were infected with HIV and who had undergone splenectomy. There was a significant increase in the mean CD4 numbers following splenectomy (mean increase of 326/microliters, or 2.1-fold, P = 0.0009), the total lymphocyte numbers (mean increase of 1.55/ml, or 2.2-fold, P = 0.001) and in the CD8 lymphocyte count (mean increase of 968/microliters, or 2.3-fold, P = 0.014). No significant difference was observed in the percentage CD4 lymphocytes (P = 0.95) or in the CD4:CD8 lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.76). In two patients, symptoms suggestive of impaired immune function developed post-splenectomy, at a time when their CD4 lymphocyte numbers were markedly higher than their pre-splenectomy values. One developed oral candidiasis (CD4 960/microliters, percentage CD4 32%), and in one patient a 7 kg weight loss was associated with recurrent mouth ulcers (CD4 680/microliters, percentage CD4 7%). We conclude that the total CD4 count increases significantly after splenectomy while the percentage CD4 lymphocyte count and CD4:CD8 lymphocyte ratio do not. Our data suggest that the CD4 lymphocyte count overestimates the immune function in these patients, although our findings are not conclusive."

In this study semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is compared with a new branched DNA signal amplification methodology. Samples from HCV-infected patients as well as from human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients were evaluated. Reverse transcriptase PCR correlated well with the branched DNA assay (r = 0.7036, P < 0.05). HCV RNA was found to occur at significantly higher titers (P < 0.05) in patients coinfected with the human immunodeficiency virus compared with titers in those infected with HCV alone.

The goal of this study was to compare survival durations of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected IDUs for the period 1987-2004.Methods. Demographic data, drug use characteristics, and biological markers were obtained at the time of admission to a substance abuse treatment program. The outcome of interest was the duration of survival after admission, and the primary exposure was HIV infection. Vital status was ascertained by means of the mortality register by the end of 2004. Three calendar periods, which were defined on the basis of use of specific therapies, were considered: 1987-1991 (the antiretroviral monotherapy era), 1992-1996 (the dual combination therapy era and the era when methadone was introduced in Spain), and 1997-2004 (the era of HAART and of established methadone programs). We used Cox regression methods allowing for late entries to handle the contribution of persons who survived a given period and entered the following period with nonzero time. We compared HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected IDUs with adjustments for age, sex, and duration of follow-up after admission."
3651,0.003,3.0,"A sero-epidemiological survey of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a randomly selected sample of 957 persons from the population of the Austral Island group in French Polynesia was conducted as a first step before developing an immunization programme strategy. Prevalence rates of HBsAg ranged from 3.09% to 27% in the different islands of the group with a weighted mean of 10.48%, while the prevalence rate for at least one marker ranged from 46.91% to 81.03% with a weighted mean of 64.12%. In the 0-11 months and 1-4 years age groups, 2.08% and 10.57%, respectively, of the children were HBsAg carriers. These findings, when compared to the mean population carrier rate of 10.48%, suggest that HBV transmission occurred mostly after the first year of life. The highest prevalence rate for HBeAg positivity was in the 5-19 years age group (more than 40% of the HBsAg carriers were HBeAg positive), suggesting that contagiousness was greatest in childhood and adolescence. HBsAg was found in 11.45% of women of child-bearing age and HBeAg in 19.09% of women positive for HBsAg. It is concluded that immunization of newborns and infants, using vaccine alone, should be the most effective strategy for reducing HBV infection in the Austral Islands archipelago."

Although this is an improvement over previous years, significant operational challenges have inhibited progress toward universal access to HIV care and treatment. Despite these challenges, the intense efforts focused on addressing the HIV epidemic present an opportunity for overall health systems improvement in developing nations. In October 2006, Harvard University's Centers for AIDS Research, the Nelson Mandela School of Medicine, the Department of Health of KwaZulu-Natal, and the Medical Research Council of South Africa held a conference entitled ""The Realities of Antiretroviral Therapy Rollout: Challenges to Successful Programmatic Implementation"" in Durban, South Africa.

However, little is known about the characteristics of substance abuse and its impact on medication adherence among HIV-positive women with a history of child sexual abuse (CSA). In the present study, 148 HIV-positive women with a history of CSA completed a structured interview assessing CSA severity, psychological status, substance abuse, medication adherence, and sexual decision-making. Severity of CSA was significantly associated with substance use but not with adherence. Participants who had used hard drugs and who had lower self-esteem and adherence self-efficacy reported significantly lower levels of adherence. Additional research on how CSA experiences impact health behaviors is needed to help develop culturally congruent interventions to reduce risk behaviors and facilitate better medication adherence for this vulnerable population."
7977,0.003,3.0,"Renal disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent comorbidity in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The increase in life expectancy following the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and the long-term development of metabolic complications (such as diabetes and dyslipidaemia), hypertension, and vascular diseases can contribute to the increasing frequency in the recognition of renal impairment in HIV-infected patients. Some antiretroviral agents, and particularly tenofovir, have been associated with nephrotoxic drug effects, including decline in glomerular filtration rate, proximal tubular damage, and acute kidney injury. The occurrence of clinically evident renal toxicity in patients treated with HAART seems to be very low, but glomerular or tubular subclinical dysfunction may occur more frequently. Therefore, careful clinical and laboratory monitoring for the early recognition of renal abnormalities is recommended for all subjects receiving antiretroviral treatment. In this article, the current knowledge about the nephrotoxic effects of antiretroviral agents has been reviewed, and an algorithm for screening and management of HAART-related kidney disease is proposed in the light of the most recent clinical studies and international guidelines."

Program participants showed significant improvement over comparison group participants on measures of HIV/AIDS and treatment-related knowledge and recognition and understanding of HIV terms. Although there were no significant changes in adherence mastery and behaviors during the 6-week follow up period, there were significant changes in program participants' knowledge about medication adherence. Future steps to examine the sustainability of the program in the medical management of patients are planned in addition to determining its long-range relative impact."
7790,0.003,3.0,"Sargramostim is a yeast-derived, recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor with therapeutic potential in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Its safety and activity when used in combination with protease inhibitors were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind trial in which 20 HIV-infected subjects on stable antiretroviral regimens, including indinavir or ritonavir, received sargramostim or placebo 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Analysis of HIV virus load excluded any 0. 5 log10 increase due to sargramostim (95% confidence interval, -0.68 to 0.44). Sargramostim was well tolerated, and inflammatory cytokines and surrogate markers of disease progression, such as serum levels of interleukin-10 and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors types Iota and IotaIota, remained stable in subjects receiving sargramostim. Sargramostim treatment was associated with a trend toward decreased HIV RNA (>0.5 log10) and increased CD4+ cell count (>30%). These results became statistically significant only when subjects with baseline virus loads within the limits of detection or baseline CD4 cell count >50 were analyzed. No difference in indinavir pharmacokinetics was observed before or after sargramostim therapy."
8945,0.003,3.0,"A total of 82 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-specific cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones were isolated and characterized from 5 HIV-infected subjects, utilizing multiple HLA class I alleles. B62-restricted, HIV-1 gag-specific CTL clones isolated from a single blood sample from 1 subject used four different Vbeta gene rearrangements. Multiple CTL clones could be isolated from the same time point directed against HIV-1 gag, nef, and env from 1 subject. A prospective analysis resulted in the isolation of CTL clones from 1 subject directed against multiple HIV-1 antigens, including the same highly conserved nef peptide, over a 1-year period, in the absence of detectable circulating viral plasma RNA. These data suggest that in some persons without clinical progression and low levels of circulating HIV-1, the CTL response is polyclonal, is directed against multiple HIV-1 proteins, including highly conserved peptides within these proteins, and is maintained over time."
8714,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the infectious agent of both acute and chronic hepatitis. HBV exists in multiple genotypic variants that differ in their capacity to become persistent chronic infections and in their clinical manifestations, including hepatocellular carcinoma. The 8 genotypes (A-H) of HBV show a specific worldwide geographic distribution and are correlated with different disease course, severity, and response to therapy. We isolated DNA from 75 HBV-positive blood donors, chosen randomly from the database of the National Blood Bank in Tirana, to specifically analyze the UGT1A1 polymorphism to determine its correlations with bilirubin levels and liver function. The large number of subjects who were HBV-positive carriers of heterozygosis or homozygosis for the UGT1A1*28 (TA)7 polymorphism suggests that these individuals may be more susceptible to cancer and should follow a strict regime of prevention.

We present here an analysis of patients recorded in the cohort database between 1st of January 2006 and 31st of December 2008. During that period, 11982 patients were under medical follow-up in Belgium. Sixty-one percent of the patients were male and the median age was 39.8 at the time of first recorded viral load. Among the patients whose nationality or probable mode of transmission was recorded, nearly half (48.0%) were Belgian and 38.3% originated from Sub-Saharan Africa; heterosexual contacts were reported in the majority of cases (56.0%) followed by homosexual contacts (35.3%). A total of 145 deaths were reported. Around three quarters of the patients were on ART. The median CD4 cell count rose from 470 cells/mm3 in 2006 to 501 cells/mm3 in 2008. This cohort enabled us to obtain comprehensive information on the numbers and characteristics of HIV-infected patients currently being followed up in Belgium, and on trends in antiretroviral therapy and biological results. This will serve for planning purposes, evaluation of access to care and as a source of information for further studies."
1993,0.003,3.0,"We analyzed hepatitis B virus (HBV) genomes obtained from serum samples and liver biopsy specimen of a chronic HBsAg/anti-HBe carrier with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Before the liver biopsy, performed at the time of HCC diagnosis, the patient had been followed for 2 years; the serum samples collected in that period resulted negative for HBV-DNA dot blot hybridization. The hepatic DNA was at first examined by Southern blot, but no HBV sequence was detected. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification revealed the presence of HBV genomes in DNA extracted from the liver tissue and from two serum samples collected, respectively, 1 and 2 years before the biopsy. Direct sequence of the amplified preC/C and preS regions showed that the viral populations present in serum and liver were identical and that they had a 34 nucleotide deletion in the preS2 region, while the preC region presented two mutations each introducing a translational stop codon, one at the carboxy terminal end and the other at the second codon of the region, both able to prevent HBeAg expression. These results identify a new HBV variant which was selected during a chronic infection, and had very low levels of replication as shown by its detection only after PCR amplification."
9414,0.003,3.0,"The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among acute burn patients and its impacts on patient's outcomes in an Iranian burn care hospital. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary burn care hospital in Iran, retrospectively reviewing the data records of all patients admitted between February 2011 and February 2012. The HIV status of all the patients was assessed in relation to clinical outcomes and the patient's prognosis. A total of 969 patients were included in this study. Five patients (0·5%) were HIV positive, and all of them were male. Mean burn area was significantly larger in HIV-positive patients than the healthy group (P < 0·05). HIV-positive patients had a longer period of hospitalisation than HIV-negative patients (23·2 ± 16·3 versus 13·1 ± 14·6, P = 0·008). Nonetheless, the average number of procedures and the mortality rate did not significantly differ between the study groups (P > 0·05). Comparison of age, sex and burn extent between HIV-positive patients and HIV-negative cases also revealed similar results. Prevalence of HIV infection among our burn population was 0·5%; thus, HIV status may be related with more extensive injuries and longer hospital stays."

Homosexual or bisexual males (n = 65) with chronic HBV infection attending The Middlesex Hospital, London were studied, of whom two had clinical evidence of chronic liver disease. HBV DNA was amplified from 62 of 65 serum samples using nested and double nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Direct sequencing of the PCR products was employed to investigate sequence variation. HBV-DNA from all available HBeAg-negative (n = 9) and selected HBeAg-positive (n = 33) sera were sequenced in the entire precore gene, the 3' terminal portion of the X gene (aa128-154), and the 5' terminus of the core gene (aa18-73). Sequences were highly conserved in all regions studied. Samples from two anti-HBe-seropositive patients contained mutations in the precore region. In one, a single mutation in the first amino acid resulted in a change to leucine, which would prevent translation of this region and therefore HBeAg expression. Wild type sequences were also detected in this sample. In the other sample from a patient with overt chronic liver disease, a mutation of precore amino acid 28 changed a tryptophan residue to a stop codon which would also prevent HBeAg expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7991,0.003,3.0,"To investigate the range of pathology shown by acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphomas arising in an epidemiologically well-defined group of patients, all cases of lymphoma recognized in Danish human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals up to the end of 1988 were studied. Twenty-seven cases (26 high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL], 1 Hodgkin's disease) were found, to give a cumulative incidence rate of 8% among Danish AIDS patients. Morphologically most NHL patients were classified into two groups: 1) high-grade tumors with a predominant population of immunoblasts, either monomorphic or more often polymorphic with plasmacytic differentiation; 2) Burkitt-type. Of 26 NHLs, 22 had a B-cell paraffin-section immunophenotype and 4 were non-B, non-T. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA was demonstrated in tumor cells of 12 of 24 cases (50%) using in situ nucleic acid hybridization with a 35S-labeled probe in paraffin sections. Epstein-Barr virus DNA was found in 65% of group 1 and 20% of group 2 tumors. This study suggests the existence of two main groups of AIDS-related lymphoma with different pathogeneses. First there are immunoblast-rich lesions, which usually are associated with EBV and morphologically resemble lymphomas described in immunosuppressed organ-transplantation patients. Second there are Burkitt-type tumors in which EBV sequences are less common and that may be pathogenetically analogous to sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma."
3301,0.003,3.0,"Quantitative PCR assays used to monitor hepatitis B virus (HBV) load differ in their ability to detect different HBV variants. This study evaluated the performance of the Abbott RT PCR assay for quantitating DNA from different HBV genotypes and from HBV variants bearing HBsAg gene mutations. The study was performed on a randomly-selected sample with a viral load >6logIU/mL for each genotype and on 25 HBsAg variants. Each sample was assayed using the Abbott RT assay and with the Roche Cobas AmpliPrep-Cobas TaqMan as a reference method. All HBV genotypes were detected with the Abbott RT assay with an equivalent dynamic range (1-8logIU/mL). For each genotype, the data suggest that the assay was linear over the entire dilution range (r(2): 0.985-0.995). For the 25 HBsAg variants, viral titres determined with the two assays correlated well (r(2): 0.929). The mean difference between the two methods was -0.295 (95% CI: -0.520 to -0.071). The difference was lower than 1log unit in all but two cases. In conclusion, the Abbott RT assay can detect and quantify DNA from different HBV variants with equivalent performance and is thus suitable for routine monitoring of patients with chronic HBV infections."

8192,0.003,3.0,"In a prospective cohort study of 265 laboratory and affiliated workers, one individual with no recognized risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was HIV-1 seropositive at the time of entry into the study. Molecular analyses of two HIV-1 isolates derived in two independent laboratories from a blood sample from this worker showed that the isolates were indistinguishable from a genotypic form of HIV-1 present in the H9/HTLV-IIIB cell line. Exposure to this strain of virus most probably occurred during work with concentrated virus or culture fluids from virus-producing cell lines under standard Biosafety Level 3 containment. Although no specific incident leading to this infection has been identified, undetected skin contact with virus culture supernatant might have occurred. This worker was the only one found to be positive among the subgroup of 99 workers who shared a work environment involving exposure to concentrated virus. The incidence rate of 0.48 per 100 person-years exposure indicates that prolonged laboratory exposure to concentrated virus is associated with some risk of HIV-1 infection, which is comparable to the risk for health care workers experiencing a needle stick exposure. While none of the ten workers with parenteral exposure to HIV-1 in this cohort became infected, a worker in another laboratory did seroconvert following an injury with a potentially contaminated needle. Strict Biosafety Level 3 containment and practices should be followed when working with concentrated HIV-1 preparations, and further refinement of the procedures may be necessary."
2466,0.003,3.0,"Our work aimed to examine the potential influence of variants in interleukin/interleukin receptors genes on high-risk (HR-HPV) HPV clearance. Clearance of genital HR-HPV infection was evaluated for 134 HIV-1 seropositive African-American female adolescents from the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) cohort. Genotyping targeted 225 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the exons, 5' untranslated region (UTR) and 3' UTR sequences of 27 immune-related candidate genes encoding interleukin family of cytokines. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the association of type-specific HPV clearance adjusting for time-varying CD4+ T-cell count and low-risk (LR-HPV) HPV co-infections. HR-HPV clearance rates were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with five SNPs (rs228942, rs419598, rs315950, rs7737000, and rs9292618) mapped to coding and regulatory regions in three genes (IL2RB, IL1RN, and IL7R).

2732,0.003,3.0,"In order to assess the adequacy of learning about the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in vocational training for general practice, a postal questionnaire survey was carried out among trainers and their trainees in seven health regions of England and Scotland. A total of 616 trainers (62%) and 538 trainees (58%) responded to the questionnaire asking about their knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding HIV and AIDS. Trainees' principal difficulties with HIV and AIDS resembled those of general practitioners currently in practice. More than 60% of trainees lacked knowledge about HIV and AIDS in babies, 50% would not accept intravenous drug misusers onto their list, only 12% found it easy to discuss sex with homosexual male patients, and only 37% felt able to offer counselling about HIV and AIDS. Trainees who had had a tutorial on HIV and AIDS as part of vocational training were significantly more knowledgeable than the remainder (P less than 0.01). In addition, trainees who found workshops on HIV and AIDS useful were more willing than others to take on drug misusers (P less than 0.05) and more confident in their ability to counsel patients with HIV infection (P less than 0.01). No significant associations were found between the trainers' own knowledge, attitudes and skills regarding HIV and AIDS and those of their trainees. It is concluded that there is a need to improve teaching about HIV and AIDS in vocational training for general practice. All general practitioner trainees should receive a tutorial to update their knowledge about HIV and AIDS, and attend a suitable workshop to challenge unfavourable attitudes and improve confidence in counselling."

Thirty-five cases were women who accepted postpartum sterilization and twenty-two controls were women who refused this method. The acceptance of tubal occlusion was statistically more frequent in multiparous women, and in those with previous children infected with HIV. The antecedent of at least one previous pregnancy had an association with the acceptance of tubal occlusion with an OR of 11.2 (CI 95% 2.9 to 42.9); having at least one previous child HIV-infected had an OR of 4.6 (CI 95% 1.3 to 23.1).

These rates remained 17 times greater among AAPI children into the 1990s. Now, although almost 90% of AAPI children born after 1993 receive hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) in time to prevent HBV infection, many born before 1993 do not.

The strongest association was obtained for HCP5 rs2395029 (P=6.79x10(-10); odds ratio, 3.47) and was possibly linked to an effect of sex. Interestingly, this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was in high linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B, MICB, TNF, and several other HLA locus SNPs and haplotypes. A meta-analysis of our genomic data combined with data from the previously conducted Euro-CHAVI (Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology) GWAS confirmed the HCP5 signal (P=3.02x10(-19)) and identified several new associations, all of them involving HLA genes: MICB, TNF, RDBP, BAT1-5, PSORS1C1, and HLA-C. Finally, stratification by HCP5 rs2395029 genotypes emphasized an independent role for ZNRD1, also in the HLA locus, and this finding was confirmed by experimental data.

We aimed to assess resistance patterns and predict viral drug susceptibility among children with first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure in Uganda. A cross-sectional analysis of children switching ART regimens due to first-line failure was performed at three clinical sites in Uganda. HIV-RNA determination and genotypic resistance testing on all specimens with HIV-RNA >1,000 copies/ml were performed. Major drug resistance mutations were scored using the 2011 International Antiviral Society-USA list. The Stanford algorithm was used to predict drug susceptibility. At the time of switch, 44 genotypic resistance tests were available for 50 children. All children harbored virus with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance [95% confidence interval (CI) 92-100%] and NRTI resistance was present in 98% (95% CI 88-100%). Forty-six percent (95% CI 30-61%) of children harbored ≥2 thymidine analog mutations. M184V was identified as the only NRTI mutation in 27% (95% CI 15-43%). HIV susceptibility to NRTIs, with the exception of tenofovir, was reduced in ≥60% of children. Ugandan children experiencing first-line ART failure in our study harbored high rates of dual-class and accumulated HIV drug resistance. Methods to prevent treatment failure, including adequate pediatric formulations and alternative second-line treatment options, are urgently needed."

5787,0.003,3.0,"HIV subtype-specific data on mutation type, rate, and accumulation following HAART treatment failure are limited. We studied patterns and accrual of drug resistance mutations in a Cambodian CRF01_AE-infected cohort continuing a virologically failing first-line, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor- (NNRTI-) based, HAART. Between 2005 and 2007, 837 adult HIV-infected patients had regular plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load measurements at Sihanouk Hospital Centre of Hope (SHCH), Cambodia. Drug resistance testing was performed in all patients with HIV-1 RNA >1000 copies/ml after at least 6 months of HAART. Seventy-one patients with a mean age of 34 years, of whom 68% were male, were retrospectively assessed at virological failure. The median duration of antiretroviral therapy was 12.3 (IQR 7.1-18.23) months, the median CD4 cell count was 173 (IQR 118-256) cells/mm(3), and the mean plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 3.9 log (SD 0.72) at failure. NNRTI mutations, M184I/V mutation, thymidine analogue mutations, and K65R were observed in 78.9%, 69%, 20%, and 12.7% of patients, respectively. For 33 patients, genotypic testing was carried out on at least two occasions before the switch to second-line HAART after a median duration of 5.8 (IQR 4.3-6.1) months of virological failure: 54.5% of patients accumulated new mutations with a rate of 1.6 mutations per person-year. Accumulation was seen both for nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and also in patients with low-level viremia. Subtype-specific data on mutation type, rate, and accumulation after HAART failure are urgently needed to optimize treatment strategies in resource-limited settings."
7938,0.003,3.0,"Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease and the important role that viral load plays in the initial selection of antiretroviral therapy significantly alters our management of this disease. Guidelines from the British HIV Association, International AIDS Society-USA, and United States Public Health Service panels regarding the selection of appropriate antiretroviral therapy, and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, have recently been published. Despite tremendous advances in treating the disease and its related complications, a comprehensive, long-term disease management plan that includes recognition of patient concerns about quality of life is lacking. New approaches to managing HIV disease must now include strategies that address patient concerns about fatigue, gastrointestinal distress, malnutrition, and weight loss. Patients must become more involved in decisions about selection of specific drugs and drug regimens and must be consulted about their expectations and needs. We have made significant strides in the treatment of HIV disease. We can readily reduce the viral burden to virtually undetectable levels, and we must continue to develop even more potent and tolerable treatment regimens. We can make patients live longer. Helping patients live better quality lives deserves further study."
7668,0.003,3.0,"Tuberculosis (TB) enhances human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) activity in patients with dual HIV-1/TB infection. Therapies that control augmentations of HIV-1 activity at sites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection may be useful in inhibition of viral expansion. Regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) analogues (AOP and NNY) are potent in inhibiting the entry of primary HIV-1 isolates into host mononuclear cells. These analogues were used to inhibit MTB-induced HIV-1 entry in blood monunuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with pulmonary TB, and pleural fluid mononuclear cells (PFMC) from patients with pleural TB. PBMC or PFMC were cultured with and without MTB in presence and absence of RANTES analogues. HIV-1 strong stop DNA was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a measure of infection. CCR5 mRNA was assessed by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and by immunostaining and FACS analysis. HIV-1 infection was induced by MTB in vitro in PBMC from the majority (14 of 20) of HIV-1/TB subjects, and new infection was inhibited by AOP- or NNY-RANTES. HIV-1 infection was also inhibited by these reagents in MTB-induced PFMC from three of three patients with pleural TB. Expression of CCR5 mRNA was significantly induced by MTB in PBMC from patients with pulmonary TB. Further, expression of CCR5 was higher in PFMC compared to PBMC from patients with pleural TB. Also, CCR5 was fourfold higher on CD14(+) pleural mononuclear cells than on CD4(+) lymphocytes. Blocking new HIV-1 infection of mononuclear cells may be useful in control of HIV-1 during dual HIV-1/TB infection."
8085,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) invades the central nervous system (CNS) during acute infection which can result in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in up to 50% of patients, even in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Within the CNS, productive HIV-1 infection occurs in the perivascular macrophages and microglia. Astrocytes also become infected, although their infection is restricted and does not give rise to new viral particles. The major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 is the establishment of viral reservoirs in different anatomical sites throughout the body and viral persistence during long-term treatment with cART. While the predominant viral reservoir is believed to be resting CD4(+) T cells in the blood, other anatomical compartments including the CNS, gut-associated lymphoid tissue, bone marrow, and genital tract can also harbour persistently infected cellular reservoirs of HIV-1. Viral latency is predominantly responsible for HIV-1 persistence and is most likely governed at the transcriptional level. Current clinical trials are testing transcriptional activators, in the background of cART, in an attempt to purge these viral reservoirs and reverse viral latency. These strategies aim to activate viral transcription in cells constituting the viral reservoir, so they can be recognised and cleared by the immune system, while new rounds of infection are blocked by co-administration of cART. The CNS has several unique characteristics that may result in differences in viral transcription and in the way latency is established. These include CNS-specific cell types, different transcription factors, altered immune surveillance, and reduced antiretroviral drug bioavailability. A comprehensive understanding of viral transcription and latency in the CNS is required in order to determine treatment outcomes when using transcriptional activators within the CNS."

Community respiratory virus infections are increasingly recognized as a significant threat to these patients. This article reviews current information in the clinical field of community respiratory viruses, including several newly discovered respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses cause the most serious disease in immunocompromised hosts, but other respiratory viruses are becoming increasingly appreciated as a cause of both upper and lower respiratory tract disease. The clinical impact of these new viruses, including human metapneumovirus, non-SARS human coronaviruses, and human bocavirus, is not yet clear. Modern molecular technology has made the discovery of new viruses possible; the use of these new technologies in direct patient care is not yet standard but is becoming increasingly utilized.

In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the care of these patients has become increasingly complex as survival has improved. Patients infected with HIV who also have ESRD are at risk for critical interactions between medication regimens to treat both of these conditions. Within this population, hemo- and peritoneal dialysis as well as kidney transplantation are life sustaining but present a host of obstacles related to HIV monitoring and risk of transmission, access thrombosis, infection, and rejection. Knowledge of antiretroviral regimens, drug interactions, and HIV resistance as well as the management of ESRD in the presence of HIV infection will improve the care of these unique patients."
6869,0.003,3.0,"Human primary endothelial cell cultures, derived from umbilical vein (HUVEC), can be infected by different strains of HIV-1, but mature virus production remains undetectable both in supernatants and in cellular extracts. Yet viral DNA is transiently detectable during the first days of infection, but progressively declines during the subsequent days. This finding is characteristic of abortive infections. Co-culture of HUVEC carrying HIV DNA with activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells or with CD4-positive lymphoid cells elicited a massive cpe (syncytia formation and cell degeneration) in the latter cells, caused by the establishment of productive HIV-1 infection. HUVEC infected in the presence of AZT were significantly impaired in the ability to transmit the infection of CD4-positive cells, indicating that active DNA synthesis is required in HUVEC before rescue by CD4-positive cells. These results are of interest in view of the possibility that endothelial cells can play a role in the transmission of HIV-1 infection from infected pregnant women to the foetuses, and, more generally, suggest a potential role of endothelial cells as a transient reservoir of HIV-1."

9327,0.003,3.0,"The prognosis of HIV infection has been modified by antiretroviral therapy. However, the morbidity and the mortality of HCV co-infection increase and may be a major problem of health service. Up to now co-infected patients are excluded of transplantation due to complexity, the ethical aspects, the immunodeficiency and the co-infection. This study tries to estimate the feasibility in this population. Between December 1999 and March 2002, seven patients were transplanted. The average of CD4 was 332/ml; the viral load was <50 copies/ml. Before transplantation, no patient had experienced opportunist infection and all patients received antiretroviral therapy adapted to their history. The average follow-up is of 14 months: one patient died 3 months after transplantation, the other one presented a candida in oesophagus, the average of CD4 was 280/ml, and viral load was <50 copies/ml in five patients. A relapse of HVC was observed in all patients. Interferon/rivabirine therapy was proposed for four patients. Every patient received tacrolimus and corticoids. HAART were modified four times for toxicity and one time for virological failure. We observed two cases of transient renal insufficiency, two cases of diabetes, two cases of pancreatitis, and abnormalities of the respiratory mitochondrial chain in four patients. Finally, liver transplantation in HIV-HCV co-infected patients seems to be feasible when strict criteria of selection are taken into account. This still experimental strategy requires a multidisciplinary partnership."
3436,0.003,3.0,"The drug resistance profile of treatment-naive HIV-infected individuals living in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was studied. Samples taken from 94 drug-naive individuals with established HIV infection and 13 patients with primary HIV infection were assessed by nucleotide sequencing and LIPA. The prevalence of drug-associated primary mutations in individuals with established infection was very low. In the viral protease region, 1/86 (1.2%) individuals carried the D30N mutation, whereas 1/85 (1.2%) had the M41L mutation in the reverse transcriptase (RT) region. Secondary mutations in both the protease and RT regions were found in almost 90% of the individuals. In individuals with primary infection, primary mutations were detected in 2/13 (15.4%) patients, one of them carrying M461 mutation in the protease while the other patient had a mutation at codon 184 of the RT. In accordance with current drug resistance testing guidelines, the results of this study suggest that susceptibility tests need not be performed at this time prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected people in Argentina. However, the public health implications of this subject warrant follow-up studies that will examine a larger number of drug-naive patients, not only in Buenos Aires but also in other major Argentinian cities and in rural areas."

The 2.3 per cent positivity in the test group and the 8 per cent positivity in the control group did not suggest the involvement of hepatitis-B virus (HBV), as an influencing or associated agent. When 48 patients with glomerulonephropathies and 23 controls were screened for liver cell membrane (LMA) and renal cell membrane antibodies (RMA) by indirect immunofluorescent technique using isolated rat hepatocytes and renal cells, 79.2 per cent LMA positivity was seen in the HBsAg positive group and 41.7 per cent in the negative group and RMA positivity was 58 per cent in the positive group and 25 per cent in the negative group. Simultaneous positivity for both LMA and RMA was recorded in 50 per cent of the HBsAg positive patients and 15.7 per cent of the negative ones.

2607,0.003,3.0,"The study examined the relationship between coping and psychosocial variables (psychological stress symptoms, locus of control, emotional repression, and social support) among 108 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The authors administered several tests, including one that measures fighting spirit and degree of hopelessness, to assess each patient's individual coping style. The patients who were adjusting well to their HIV-positive status tended to have a higher level of fighting spirit and lower degree of hopelessness than those patients who were not adjusting well to their HIV-positive status. A coping style based on incapacity to face and confront HIV infection was associated with symptoms of psychological stress, repression of anger, external locus of control, and low social support in the latter group. These patients showed symptoms indicating maladjustment to HIV infection (43% of the sample) and differed from the ""noncases"" (the well-adjusted patients) in that the former group reported inadequate coping responses (lower fighting spirit and higher hopelessness, fatalistic attitude, and anxious preoccupation) and poorer social support, and had a greater tendency to repress anger and express sadness. The data support the hypothesis that coping with HIV infection is a complex phenomenon involving multiple and interacting variables. Interventions aimed at improving the coping style for many HIV patients are needed."
9745,0.003,3.0,"We conducted a survey of a random sample of California orthodontists and of general dentists to compare their infection control procedures. Questionnaires were returned by 124 orthodontists (56% response rate) and 126 general dentists (61% response rate). Eighteen questions were asked covering practice profile, perception of risk from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), exposure to blood, barrier protection used, and sterilization and disinfection procedures. Gloves always were worn by 80% of the orthodontists sampled, 63% always wore glasses, and 59% changed gloves between patients. Orthodontists sterilized their instruments 66% of the time and pliers 49% of the time. Compared with general dentists, orthodontists' perception of risk, use of barrier protection, and sterilization and disinfection procedures were lower in all areas. Our data suggest that poorer performance may be because orthodontists: (1) perceive their younger population of patients at less risk for HBV and HIV; (2) treat 2.5 times as many patients, which increases the costs of infection control; (3) do not use invasive procedures; and (4) perceive that glove use decreases dexterity. Orthodontists should follow the American Dental Association/Council on Dental Therapeutics infection control guidelines for universal precautions. To meet these guidelines, orthodontists still need improvement in all aspects of their infection control procedures."
348,0.003,3.0,"We describe the identification of the protozoan parasite Enterocytozoon bieneusi in the stool of a patient who was not infected with HIV but who presented with persistent diarrheal disease and severe abdominal complaints. The patient was not infected with HIV but had been noted to have a decreased CD4 cell count since at least 1992 and had had a prior episode of cryptococcal meningitis. The organisms were detected in stool smears with a modified trichrome stain and were identified to the species level by transmission electron microscopy of the stool. The patient responded readily and dramatically to treatment with albendazole, with resolution of symptoms and clearance of the organisms from the stool. Eight or possibly nine other cases of E. bieneusi infection associated with diarrheal disease in individuals who were not infected with HIV were identified in the English-language literature. In two individuals with intact immune function, symptoms were self-limited and diarrheal disease resolved within 2 weeks. The cases summarized herein suggest that E. bieneusi may be more commonly associated with sporadic diarrheal disease than was previously suspected and that the immune system may play a role in the control of this organism within the intestine."
6351,0.003,3.0,"The intersection and syndemic interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics have global prevalence with devastating morbidity and massive mortality. Using FDG-PET imaging it was shown that in HIV-infected individuals, involvement of the head and neck precedes that of the chest and of the abdomen. The sequence of lymph node involvement observed suggests the existence of a diffusible activation mediator that may be targeted via therapeutic intervention strategies. Furthermore, the degree of FDG uptake proved directly related to viral load and inversely related to CD4 cell count. Available data in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining cancers further suggest that FDG-PET/CT imaging may be useful for prognostication of cervical cancer and for identifying appropriate sites for biopsy, staging, and monitoring lymphoproliferative activity owing to HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma and multicentric Castleman disease. Inversely, in HIV-associated lymphoma, FDG uptake in HIV-involved lymphoid tissue was shown to reduce the specificity of FDG-PET imaging findings, the effect of which in clinical practice warrants further investigation. In the latter setting, knowledge of viremia appears to be essential for FDG-PET image interpretation. Early HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, formerly known as AIDS dementia complex, proved to be characterized by striatal hypermetabolism and progressive HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder or AIDS dementia complex by a decrease in subcortical and cortical metabolism. In lipodystrophic HIV-infected individuals, lipodystrophy proved associated with increased glucose uptake by adipose tissue, likely resulting from the metabolic stress of adipose tissue in response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Furthermore, ongoing chronic low-grade infection in arteries of HIV-infected individuals could be depicted by FDG-PET/CT imaging. And there is promising data that FDG-PET/CT in HIV may serve as a new marker for the evaluation of thymic function in HIV-infected patients. In the setting of TB, FDG-PET has proven unable to differentiate malignancy from TB in patients presenting with solitary pulmonary nodules, including those suffering from HIV, and thus cannot be used as a tool to reduce futile biopsy or thoracotomy in these patients. In patients presenting with extrapulmonary TB, FDG-PET imaging was found to be significantly more efficient when compared with CT for the identification of more sites of involvement. Thus supporting that FDG-PET/CT can demonstrate lesion extent, serve as guide for biopsy with aspiration for culture, assist surgery planning and contribute to follow-up. Limited available data suggest that quantitative FDG-PET findings may allow for prediction or rapid assessment, at 4 months following treatment instigation, of response to antituberculostatics in TB-infected HIV patients. These results and more recent findings suggest a role for FDG-PET/CT imaging in the evaluation of therapeutic response in TB patients. "

Referral rate for HIV testing was 4.4% (30/684) in 2007, 15.4% (116/751) in 2008, and 30.1% (283/940) in 2009, with a significant upward trend over the period of time (P = .009). The main barriers perceived by health providers were poor knowledge about TB/HIV, lack of communication skills, absence of any target plan for TB patient referral for HIV testing, and fear associated with informing positive test results to the TB patients and the associated stigma. Strategies to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS/TB among TB patients and their providers may improve the current state of low referral and its barriers in Cambodia. "

However, 7 of 12 patients with seroconversion experienced relapse after cessation of therapy. Multivariate analysis revealed that the duration of an undetectable HBV DNA load was the only independent predictive factor for nonrelapse (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.9). More-prolonged lamivudine therapy is required after seroconversion, and persistent duration of an HBV DNA level of <0.7 log IU/mL for >6 months can more accurately aid in the decision of when to stop lamivudine therapy."

Variables associated with initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) were analysed. Primary endpoint was time to failure after at least 6 months of ART and was defined as: VF, first of two consecutive virus loads (VL) >200 copies/mL; treatment discontinuation (TD) for any reason; and treatment failure as confirmed VL >200 copies/mL or TD. A Poisson multivariable analysis was performed to control for confounders. Migrants presented significantly lower CD4 counts and more frequent AIDS events at baseline. When adjusting for baseline confounders, migrants presented a lower likelihood to begin ART (odds ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.95, p 0.012). After initiating ART, the incidence VF rate was 6.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI 4.8-8.5) in migrants and 2.7 in natives (95% CI 2.2-3.3). Multivariable analysis confirmed that migrants had a higher risk of VF (incidence rate ratio 1.90, 95% CI 1.25-2.91, p 0.003) and treatment failure (incidence rate ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33, p 0.031), with no differences for TD. Among migrants, variables associated with VF were age, unemployment and use of a boosted protease inhibitor-based regimen versus nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

3465,0.003,3.0,"Certain histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are associated with improved clinical outcomes for individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but the mechanisms for their effects remain undefined. An early CD8(+) T-cell escape mutation in the dominant HLA-B57-restricted Gag epitope TW10 (TSTLQEQIGW) has been shown to impair HIV-1 replication capacity in vitro. We demonstrate here that this T(242)N substitution in the capsid protein is associated with upstream mutations at residues H(219), I(223), and M(228) in the cyclophilin A (CypA)-binding loop in B57(+) individuals with progressive disease. In an independent cohort of epidemiologically linked transmission pairs, the presence of these substitutions in viruses encoding T(242)N was associated with significantly higher plasma viremia in donors, further suggesting that these secondary mutations compensated for the replication defect of T(242)N. Using NL4-3 constructs, we illustrate the ability of these CypA loop changes to partially restore replication of the T(242)N variant in vitro. Notably, these mutations also enhanced viral resistance to the drug cyclosporine A, indicating a reduced dependence of the compensated virus on CypA that is normally essential for optimal infectivity. Therefore, mutations in TW10 allow HIV-1 to evade a dominant early CD8(+) T-cell response, but the benefits of escape are offset by a defect in capsid function. These data suggest that TW10 escape variants undergo a postentry block that is partially overcome by changes in the CypA-binding loop and identify a mechanism for an HIV-1 fitness defect that may contribute to the slower disease progression associated with HLA-B57."
2113,0.003,3.0,"HIV-1 sequences from perinatally infected children were analyzed in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region and nef in order to investigate associations of viral variation and disease progression. Four long-term survivors who reached 10 years of age or older, and four rapid progressors who survived less than 2 years, participated in this study. LTR sequences of multiple independent viral variants from each individual were compared. No sequence pattern within the LTR consistently distinguished long-term survivors from rapid progressors or vice versa. Deletions and insertions within transcription factor binding sites of the LTR and nef ranging from 8 to 341 bp were found in viral variants from the eldest long-term survivor (LTS047). These deletions and duplications may be associated with the survival of LTS047 via an unknown mechanism. Among all children in this study, the sites in the untranslated region (NF-kappaB, SP1, and TATA box) were more conserved than the sites in the nef/LTR overlap region (NFAT, purine-rich region, USF, TCF1alpha), reflecting the importance of the sites in the untranslated region for viral replication. A mutation in the E box motif within the USF site among the sequences from a long-term survivor (LTS113) is predicted to disrupt protein binding and may be associated with slow disease progression. Mutations of the SP1-III site in a rapid progressor (RP056) indicate that this site is not necessary for rapid disease progression."

Two hundred and thirty-four patients were intravenous drug users (IVDU), 99 had homosexual and 142 heterosexual preference, seven had received blood transfusions and two had no risk factors. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb) and to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) were investigated in all patients; antibodies to HBsAg (HBsAb) and IgG antibodies to hepatitis D virus (anti-HDV) in all HBcAb-positive patients; hepatitis B e antigen and antibodies to HBeAg (HBeAg) in all HBsAg-positive patients; IgG antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) in the first 307 patients; and IgG antibodies to hepatitis E virus (anti-HEV) in the first 91 patients. As control groups, contemporary voluntary blood donors were studied for prevalence of HAV, HBV, HCV and HEV. The percentages of HBcAb, HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HEV (58.5, 14.5, 58.5 and 6.6%, respectively) were significantly higher in anti-HIV-positive patients than in control groups (3.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.8%, respectively) (P = 0.000). The prevalence of HBcAb was significantly higher in IVDU (72.6%) than in heterosexuals (33.8%) (P = 0.0001) and in homosexuals (59.6%) (P = 0.0189). The percentage of HBsAg was significantly higher in IVDU (19.2%) than in heterosexuals (6.3%) (P = 0.0004). Anti-HCV was significantly higher in IVDU (92.3%) than in homosexuals (14.1%) and in heterosexuals (33.1%) (P = 0.000 in both cases). The prevalence of anti-HDV was relatively low (1.9%). There was no difference in the percentage of anti-HAV between HIV-positive and negative subjects. In conclusion, there is a high prevalence of HBV and HCV infections in HIV-positive patients from our area. Drug use is the main route of transmission, but prevalence of HCV in patients with, probably, sexually acquired HIV infection is also higher than in the control group. The increased prevalence of HEV infection in HIV-positive individuals is another provocative finding that warrants further study."
9474,0.002,2.0,"Evidence for efficacy of established treatment guidelines for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease is based on multinational randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Strategies for managing HCV, however, require an assessment of the effectiveness of intervention in routine clinical practice. We report the outcomes of combination therapy in a large cohort of HCV-infected individuals in the UK. A total of 347 (113 genotype 1, 234 genotype non-1) patients were treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin according to current guidelines. Forty-two (37.2%) of those with genotype 1 infection and 164 (70.1%) with genotype non-1 infection achieved sustained viral response (SVR). Thirty-nine (11%) patients withdrew from treatment. In addition to viral genotype, factors predictive of a response to therapy were age at start of treatment and disease stage on pretreatment liver biopsy. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the effects of age [odds ratio 0.5; 95% confidence interval (0.31-0.82) per 10-year increment (P = 0.006)] were confined to genotype 1 disease. In order to further inform the management of the individual patient, a multivariate logistic model was used to predict the probability of SVR for subgroups defined by disease stage, genotype and age at commencement of therapy. This model revealed striking differences in predicted response rates between subgroups and provided a strong rationale for early treatment, particularly for those with genotype 1 disease. Our study demonstrates that results comparable with those of RCTs can be achieved in clinical practice, and suggests that prediction of response rates based on probability modelling will provide a valuable adjunct to individual patient management."
8173,0.002,2.0,"Penicillium marneffei (P. marneffei) is considered an indicator pathogen of AIDS, and the endemicity and clinical features of P. marneffei have been described. While, how the co-infection of P. marneffei exacerbate deterioration of the immune response remains poorly understood. Here we isolated P. marneffei from the cutaneous lesions of AIDS patients and analyzed its effects on HIV-1-dendritic cells (DCs) interaction. We demonstrated that the monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) could be activated by both thermally dimorphic forms of P. marneffei for significantly promoting HIV-1 trans-infection of CD4(+) T cells, while these activated MDDCs were refractory to HIV-1 infection. Mechanistically, P. marneffei-activated MDDCs endocytosed large amounts of HIV-1 and sequestrated the internalized viruses into tetrapasnin CD81(+) compartments potentially for proteolysis escaping. The activated MDDCs increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and facilitated the formation of DC-T-cell conjunctions, where much more viruses were recruited. Moreover, we found that P. marneffei-stimulated MDDCs efficiently activated resting CD4(+) T cells and induced more susceptible targets for viral infection. Our findings demonstrate that DC function and its interaction with HIV-1 have been modulated by opportunistic pathogens such as P. marneffei for viral dissemination and infection amplification, highlighting the importance of understanding DC-HIV-1 interaction for viral immunopathogenesis elucidation."

3735,0.002,2.0,"The age-specific prevalence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and its antibody (anti-HBe) were studied by radioimmunoassay, and compared in a large series of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, including 268 asymptomatic carriers, 389 chronic hepatitis, 114 liver cirrhosis, and 278 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prevalence of HBeAg/anti-HBe in asymptomatic carriers and patients with chronic hepatitis correlated closely with age as HBeAg prevalence decreased and anti-HBe prevalence increased with increasing age (P less than 0.0005), and is probably due to high infection rate at young age in Taiwan. The prevalence of HBeAg in patients with both cirrhosis and HCC are much significantly lower and had no correlation with age. Two peaks of age-specific prevalence of HBeAg and anti-HBe were observed in patients with HCC, implicating two patterns of HBV infection in these patients. The difference in the prevalence of HBeAg and anti-HBe might indicate that asymptomatic carriers, chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and HCC are sequential sequelae of HBV infection."

4455,0.002,2.0,"The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemic of clinically apparent human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) infection in Nicaragua and to discuss the reasons why the number of HIV patients presenting to the public health care system is increasing compared with other Central American countries. From 1987 to 2004, 1,614 HIV-positive patients were officially reported to the Nicaraguan STI/HIV/AIDS national program. Urban areas along the west-central and eastern part of Nicaragua showed the highest prevalence of AIDS, with a maximum of 54.2/year per 100,000 inhabitants. Most of the infections (91%) were acquired sexually: 65% by heterosexual contacts and 26% by homosexual contacts. The highest rate of infection was found in men aged between 20 to 39 years, with a peak around 35 to 39 years (annual incidence of 125.6 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants), and in women aged 20 to 34 years old, with a peak around 20 to 24 years (annual incidence 46.6 per 100,000 inhabitants). The male to female ratio of infection was 3:1. The death rate was stable until the beginning of 1999, but increased sharply thereafter up to 2004, the year that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced in Nicaragua. In 2005, we observed a further increase in the mortality. However, our data do not represent the magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a whole, due to a lack of systemic surveillance. HIV/AIDS in Nicaragua is in a nascent stage and is concentrated in high-risk populations, such as utility workers, commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, prisoners, street children, housewives and police and military forces. Education of the population is an urgent need to increase HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, change attitudes, and increase safer sex practice in the community."
1145,0.002,2.0,"Long-term medication regimen adherence is challenging in all populations, but in the HIV-infected adolescent population the frequency of poverty, homelessness, substance abuse, and mental illness make highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence even more challenging. In 2003, we developed a pilot program for HIV-infected adolescents and young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 who were either going to begin a HAART regimen for the first time or begin a new HAART regimen. Participants received a free cell phone with a local service plan for approximately 6 months. Participants received phone call reminders for 12 weeks. Call frequency was tapered at 4-week intervals. Patients were assessed at 4-week intervals to determine the perceived intrusiveness or helpfulness of receiving calls, and missed medication doses. Eight consecutive patients were recruited for the study, and five were able to complete it through the 24 weeks. Most participants found the calls to be helpful and the level of intrusion into their daily lives acceptable. Using cell phone reminders to assist patients does not require an extensive amount of daily staff time. Tapering calls rapidly over 3 months, followed by discontinuation of calls provided inadequate support for subjects, especially those with significant psychosocial issues such as substance abuse. Use of cell phone reminders to assist adolescents adhere with HIV medications was practical and acceptable to pilot study participants. Viral suppression waned for all but two patients after termination of cell phone reminders and suggests that a 12-week intervention was not adequate for most subjects. Larger prospective studies of cell phone observation of therapy will be needed to determine if this intervention can improve long-term adherence and health outcomes."
1246,0.002,2.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection rate was examined in a selected cohort of healthy clients of an inner-city alcohol treatment center from 1990 through 1993. These subjects were also participating in a research protocol (n = 258) designed to assess immunity and HIV risk behaviors in inner city alcohol-dependent persons. Healthy alcohol-abusing heterosexual clients (165) had HIV testing conducted in an inner-city ambulatory alcohol treatment center between September 1990 and December 1993. Respondents were 93.9% African-American and 3.6% Hispanic; 72.1% were male. Anonymous HIV-1 antibody testing was conducted retrospectively for an additional 80 subjects who participated in the research protocol during the same interval, but for whom HIV-1 antibody testing was not conducted clinically at the time. HIV infection rate among the clinic-tested subjects (n = 165) was 4.4% for individuals who were exclusively alcohol-dependent, 1.4% for non-injecting drug use (IDU) mixed substance abusers, and 46.8% for clients with a history of IDU. Rates did not differ among cohorts tested in different years. Among non-injecting drug users tested in the clinic, all infected respondents (n = 3) were women (p = 0.03). Among those tested anonymously (n = 80), however, infection rate for exclusively alcohol-dependent persons was 16.7%, non-IDU mixed abusers 11.1%, and injecting drug users 48.3%, with seropositive males as well as females in each group. HIV infection rates for the pooled samples (n = 245) were 8.7% for exclusively alcohol-dependent persons, 5.1% for mixed abusers, and 54.5% for injecting drug users. Among non-injecting drug users, exclusively alcohol-dependent women had a significantly higher (p < 0.01) infection rate (20.0%) than the remaining females and males. Infection rates among exclusively alcohol-dependent males, male and female polysubstance non-IDU abusers, and injecting drug users were comparable with that seen in an earlier screening in the same clinic in 1989, with apparently little diffusion of infection from the IDU population to other substance abusers. An exception seemed to be exclusively alcohol-dependent females, who show substantially elevated rates. Age, housing, and other social differences may help segregated substance-abusing populations in the relatively small Newark metropolitan area, although not protecting exclusively alcohol-dependent females."
9677,0.002,2.0,"The aim of this study was to determine which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes were circulating in Australia and to correlate the subtypes with risk factors associated with the acquisition of HIV-1 infection. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and HIV-1 env genes were amplified and subtyped using heteroduplex mobility analysis, with selected samples sequenced and phylogenetic analysis performed. The HIV-1 env subtypes were determined for 141 samples, of which 40 were from female patients and 101 were from male patients; 13 samples were from children. Forty-seven patients were infected by homosexual or bisexual contact, 46 were infected through heterosexual contact, 21 were infected from injecting drug use (IDU), 13 were infected by vertical transmission, 8 were infected from nosocomial exposure, and 6 were infected by other modes of transmission, including exposure to blood products, ritualistic practices, and two cases of intrafamilial transmission. Five subtypes were detected; B (n = 104), A (n = 5), C (n = 17), E (CRF01_AE; n = 13), and G (n = 2). Subtype B predominated in HIV-1 acquired homosexually (94% of cases) and by IDU (100%), whereas non-subtype B infections were mostly seen in heterosexually (57%) or vertically (22%) acquired HIV-1 infections and were usually imported from Africa and Asia. Subtype B strains of group M viruses predominate in Australia in HIV-1 transmitted by homosexual or bisexual contact and IDU. However, non-B subtypes have been introduced, mostly acquired via heterosexual contact."

7985,0.002,2.0,"The risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission from various types of homosexual contact, including oral sex, is of biologic, epidemiologic, and public health importance. The per-contact risk of acquiring HIV infection from specific acts was estimated in a prospective cohort study of 2,189 high-risk homosexual and bisexual men, conducted in San Francisco, California; Denver, Colorado; and Chicago, Illinois, in 1992-1994. During 2,633 person-years of follow-up, 60 seroconversions were observed. The estimated per-contact risk of acquiring HIV from unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URA) was 0.82 percent (95% confidence interval: 0.24, 2.76 percent) when the partner was known to be HIV+ and 0.27 percent (95% confidence interval: 0.06, 0.49 percent) when partners of unknown serostatus were included. There was heterogeneity in per-contact risk, with nine seroconversions occurring after only one or two episodes of URA. The per-contact risk associated with unprotected insertive anal and receptive oral sex with HIV-positive or unknown serostatus partners was 0.06 and 0.04 percent, respectively. URA accounted for only 15 percent of all reported sexual activity by seroconverters. As lower-risk practices become more common, they may play a larger role in propagating the epidemic and should also be addressed by interventions targeting high-risk homosexual and bisexual men."
6358,0.002,2.0,"Contact tracing--or partner notification--is a generally accepted method for the control of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), but its use as an epidemiological tool against the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been questioned. The authors find contact tracing for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) quite feasible; it makes it possible for health care providers to reach people at high risk for infection in order to offer them counseling and testing. Contact tracing must be performed by someone directly engaged in caring for the HIV infected patient, as well as in giving support and aiding the patient through possible crisis reactions. Through this approach the authors were able to identify 188 contacts to 91 index patients. Thirty-eight of the contacts were seropositive for HIV infection, and 21 of these were previously unaware of their infection."
9797,0.002,2.0,"Understanding the mechanisms underlying potential altered susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in highly exposed seronegative (ES) individuals and the later clinical consequences of breakthrough infection can provide insight into strategies to control HIV-1 with an effective vaccine. From our Seattle ES cohort, we identified one individual (LSC63) who seroconverted after over 2 years of repeated unprotected sexual contact with his HIV-1-infected partner (P63) and other sexual partners of unknown HIV-1 serostatus. The HIV-1 variants infecting LSC63 were genetically unrelated to those sequenced from P63. This may not be surprising, since viral load measurements in P63 were repeatedly below 50 copies/ml, making him an unlikely transmitter. However, broad HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses were detected in LSC63 before seroconversion. Compared to those detected after seroconversion, these responses were of lower magnitude and half of them targeted different regions of the viral proteome. Strong HLA-B27-restricted CTLs, which have been associated with disease control, were detected in LSC63 after but not before seroconversion. Furthermore, for the majority of the protein-coding regions of the HIV-1 variants in LSC63 (except gp41, nef, and the 3' half of pol), the genetic distances between the infecting viruses and the viruses to which he was exposed through P63 (termed the exposed virus) were comparable to the distances between random subtype B HIV-1 sequences and the exposed viruses. These results suggest that broad preinfection immune responses were not able to prevent the acquisition of HIV-1 infection in LSC63, even though the infecting viruses were not particularly distant from the viruses that may have elicited these responses."
8828,0.002,2.0,"We describe four patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had development of meningiomas. In contrast to those in the general population who have meningiomas, all our patients were young men; the mean age was 40 years (range, 32 to 50). Their risk behavior for HIV was homosexuality (three patients) and intravenous drug use (one patient). The CD4+ cell count in each of the three homosexual men was less than 50/microL and was 280/microL in the drug user. Imaging studies showed enhancing lesions in three of the patients. Although each of these meningiomas could have occurred in otherwise normal young to middle-aged men, we speculate that the meningiomas may have grown in these HIV-infected hosts because of either loss of immune function or dysregulation of cytokines."
3798,0.002,2.0,"The objective of this study was to examine the level of antiretroviral use and characterize individuals accessing antiretroviral therapy in British Columbia. The study was conducted by the British Columbia Persons with AIDS Society and the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS. Self-administered questionnaires were mailed out to HIV-positive members from May to September of 2002. Comparisons of sociodemographic characteristics and disease status were made using Pearson's Chi2 and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. A total of 764 (51%) HIV-positive participants returned the questionnaire. Of these, 80% reported ever using antiretroviral therapy and 64.5% indicated current use. Reasons for never taking antiretroviral therapy were high CD4 or doctor's advice (74/126; 59%), feeling healthy (50/126; 40%) and being afraid of side-effects (35/126; 28%). Those reporting current antiretroviral use were more likely to be older (p<0.001), white (p=0.01), male (p<0.001), gay or bisexual (p<0.001), graduated from high school (p=0.001), non-injecting drug user (IDU) (p<0.001) and earning a household income greater than CAN$10,000/year (p=0.003). IDU status and length of time since diagnosis remained significantly associated with antiretroviral use in multivariate models. The differences in current antiretroviral use by sociodemographic characteristics such as IDU suggest that the need remains to target marginalized populations in order to maximize the health benefits from antiretroviral therapy."
4171,0.002,2.0,"Bilateral lower motor neuron type facial palsy is an unusual neurological disorder. There are few reports that associate it with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on initial presentation. A 51-year-old married woman, who was previously healthy and had no risk of HIV infection, presented solely with bilateral simultaneous facial palsy. A positive HIV serology test was confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. Following a short course of oral prednisolone, the patient recovered completely from facial palsy in three months, even though an antiretroviral treatment was suspended. Exclusion of HIV infection in patients with bilateral facial palsy is essential for early diagnosis and management of HIV. "
7299,0.002,2.0,"Progressive outer retinal necrosis syndrome is a recently recognized variant of necrotizing herpetic retinopathy, developing in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or other conditions causing immune compromise. We report a case in which the diagnosis of retinal necrosis syndrome was made before the diagnosis of AIDS was confirmed. A 41-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of blurred vision in his left eye. Ophthalmologic examination revealed extensive retinal necrosis with total retinal detachment in his left eye and multifocal deep retinal lesions scattered in the posterior fundus as well as in the peripheral retina in his right eye. The serologic test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was positive. Despite intravenous acyclovir treatment for 1 week, the lesions in the right eye showed rapid progression. High doses of intravitreal ganciclovir were then given in addition to intravenous acyclovir. After combined treatment for 1 month, the lesions became quiescent and the visual acuity improved to 20/30. Although the patient soon developed full-blown AIDS, the vision in his right eye remained undisturbed. Physicians should suspect progressive outer retinal necrosis syndrome in any patient with rapidly progressive necrotizing retinopathy and test the patient for HIV infection. Aggressive combined antiviral agent therapy should be considered to save vision."

1870,0.002,2.0,"In order to understand the significance of presence of HIV-1 in saliva, we searched for by PCR HIV-1 proviral sequences in the saliva cells of 49 HIV-1 infected patients. Seven out 49 specimens resulted positive, 4 of which were from patients with PGL, 1 with ARC and 2 with AIDS. Four patients had a CD4+ lymphocyte counts < 200/cmm and in 3 patients the CD4+ lymphocyte count ranged from 200 to 400/cmm. Two patients were treated with AZT, 1 with DDI and 4 had no antiretroviral treatment. In conclusion, although HIV-1 proviral sequences have been found in saliva of HIV-1 infected patients, a larger group of patients should be investigated to define more precisely the role of HIV-1 in saliva."
689,0.002,2.0,"Peripheral nerve disorders are among the most common neurological complications of HIV disease. Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most common form of neuropathy in patients with AIDS and can be caused by diverse mechanisms, including infectious, metabolic, inflammatory, nutritional, and toxic factors. Antiretroviral agents may cause or contribute to HIV-related DSP. Recognition of peripheral neuropathy has become increasingly important as more patients receive nucleoside analogue agents for the treatment of HIV disease. It is crucial to correctly distinguish between the neuropathies caused by toxic effects of nucleoside analogues and those that are primarily related to underlying HIV disease, because timely diagnosis and proper treatment of peripheral neuropathies may allow the continuation of antiretroviral therapy as well as improve the quality of life. The identification and treatment of peripheral neuropathies associated with use of the nucleoside drugs zalcitabine (ddC), didanosine (ddI), and stavudine (d4T) are reviewed."
9732,0.002,2.0,"A decade has passed since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as standard of care for HIV/AIDS patients. The success of HAART is largely dependent on almost 100% adherence to it. In this study our primary aim was to understand from patients' own perspectives and experiences what resulted in them having 100% adherence to HAART. Thus, we purposefully recruited for in-depth interviews 10 participants (7 men and 3 women) with 100% adherence to HAART (>/=6 months previous to the interviews). All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by using Giorgi's phenomenological analysis approach. The following issues emerged from the analysis: readiness to go on HAART; HAART viewed as a life-line; maintenance of 100% adherence related with willingness to live longer and healthier; optimal ongoing patient-physician relationship, better coping and/or lack of perceived side effects; and improvements in clinical condition as well as in CD4 T-cells count and viral load reinforced the motivation to continue 100% adherence. The study findings should be helpful for health professionals caring for HIV-infected individuals on HAART."

34,0.002,2.0,"This article critically discusses the nursing care and management of a person living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as a long-term condition, requiring highly complex HIV care. Complex HIV care is managed in the secondary care setting. However, recent legislation has motivated shifts in HIV care to the community care setting. This article aims to enhance health professionals' understanding in order to equip practice and district nurses to deliver HIV care provision. Antiretroviral adherence is a prerequisite for disease survival as well as an essential component of complete HIV self-care management. It is therefore imperative that nurses tailor adherence strategies according to each patient's requirements. Case management strategies such as the use of cognitive behavioural therapy to alleviate depressive symptoms will be considered. Furthermore, the use of motivational interviewing for antiretroviral adherence is highlighted as a potential intervention to help patients overcome the physical, psychological and physiological challenges of living with HIV-associated comorbidities. The delivery of integrated HIV care is pivotal for the management of the person living with HIV, as is the facilitation of a self-caring behaviour. "
2514,0.002,2.0,"Previous studies have highlighted disparities in care and outcomes in HIV-positive prisoners compared to HIV-positive individuals in the population. We audited clinical outcomes of HIV-positive prisoners accessing care in 2011. Public Health England were notified of 161 prisoners with HIV in the time period studied. Audit proformas were sent to clinics reporting prisoners to the genitourinary medicine clinic activity dataset in 2011. Thirty-two clinics responded. Data for 151 HIV-positive prisoners were reported by 12 clinics, with the other clinics not reporting any prisoners. Outcomes were compared to a previous audit, British HIV Association (BHIVA) and the National AIDS Trust guidelines. Initial CD4 counts were available for 101 patients, of which 42/101 had CD4 <350 cells/mm(3). At reception, viral load data were available for 95 patients, of which 74 were on antiretroviral therapy. Of these, 50/74 (68%) had VL <40 copies/ml. Fifty-one per cent of those on highly active antiretroviral therapy were seen in a specialist clinic less than four weeks after reception. Urgency of referral to a specialist HIV clinic was not related to CD4 or viral load. Twenty-two per cent had hepatitis C co-infection. Clinical outcomes have improved since the last audit but further opportunities exist to optimise care in prisons. "
8126,0.002,2.0,"Circulating complete and defective hepatitis B virus forms, as represented by full, DNA polymerase-positive and empty, DNA polymerase-negative Dane particles, respectively, were investigated in sera from patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and related to the presence of e antigen and antibody and to the histological findings on liver biopsy. Complete hepatitis B virus particles were detected in the serum of all patients postive for e antigen, their percentage ranging from 15 to 61% of the total Dane particle population. Although most of these cases had chronic persistent or chronic active hepatitis, complete viral particles were also found in serum of 3 healthy carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen who had e antigen. These results indicate that e antigen is a marker of active virus replication and support its association with infectivity. It is also associated with liver damage because production of complete virus is a feature of chronic hepatitis. In the presence of anti-e, detection of Dane particles in serum appeared to be related to the histological findings. Most of the healthy carriers had no Dane particles in serum, whereas 80% of the cases with chronic liver disease had circulating Dane particles. However, in contrast to the cases with e antigen, 98 to 100% of Dane particles in these cases appeared to be defective in nucleic acid material on electron microscopy after positive staining. All of the patients with chronic active hepatitis in this group had progressed to cirrhosis and it is possible that production of complete virus particles is reduced in the later stages of the illness."
9481,0.002,2.0,"We examined the association of primary or nonprimary sexual partner relationship status on sexual risk behaviors, including condom use, among Latina women who are at self-disclosed increased heterosexual risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Data were collected via structured interviews of 187 Puerto Rican women, aged 18-35, who attended a health clinic in the Bronx, New York. Approximately 13% of participants reported sexual activities with both primary and nonprimary sexual partners during the 6 months prior to the interview. Primary or nonprimary sexual partner status was associated with significant differences in frequency of condom use during anal sex and oral-penile sex, with more frequent condom use reported during these sexual activities with nonprimary sexual partners. Thus, potential contextual differences associated with primary or nonprimary relationship status may represent important factors to consider when designing interventions to facilitate HIV-protective behaviors among populations of urban women identified at increased heterosexual risk for HIV infection."

HIV seroprevalence in STD clinics ranged from 0 to 38.5% (median, 2.3%), with the highest rates found in the Mid-Atlantic states, Florida, and Puerto Rico. The highest median rates were found in men who have sex with men (36.1%) and heterosexual intravenous (IV) drug users (4.1%). For heterosexual persons who do not report IV drug use, median rates were highest in the 35- to 39-year-old age group for men (6.4%) and the 30- to 34-year-old age group for women (0.9%). Among persons who do not report risk behaviors for HIV infection, men had substantially higher median rates of HIV infection than women (P less than 0.001, Wilcoxon Signed Rank test), and rates were positively correlated with HIV infection rates in IV drug users in the same clinic (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = 0.8; P less than 0.001). Among heterosexual STD clinic patients who do not report IV drug use, the median HIV infection rate for blacks (1.8%) was at least 2 times higher than the median infection rates for hispanics (0.9%) and whites (0.7%). The results of this study show that HIV infection in STD clinic patients varies by geographic area, sex, race and ethnic group, and risk behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
9091,0.002,2.0,"Research in the past two decades has generated unequivocal evidence that host genetic variations substantially account for the heterogeneous outcomes following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. In particular, genes encoding human leukocyte antigens (HLA) have various alleles, haplotypes, or specific motifs that can dictate the set-point (a relatively steady state) of plasma viral load (VL), although rapid viral evolution driven by innate and acquired immune responses can obscure the long-term relationships between HLA genotypes and HIV-1-related outcomes. In our analyses of VL data from 521 recent HIV-1 seroconverters enrolled from eastern and southern Africa, HLA-A*03:01 was strongly and persistently associated with low VL in women (frequency = 11.3 %, P < 0.0001) but not in men (frequency = 7.7 %, P = 0.66). This novel sex by HLA interaction (P = 0.003, q = 0.090) did not extend to other frequent HLA class I alleles (n = 34), although HLA-C*18:01 also showed a weak association with low VL in women only (frequency = 9.3 %, P = 0.042, q > 0.50). In a reduced multivariable model, age, sex, geography (clinical sites), previously identified HLA factors (HLA-B*18, B*45, B*53, and B*57), and the interaction term for female sex and HLA-A*03:01 collectively explained 17.0 % of the overall variance in geometric mean VL over a 3-year follow-up period (P < 0.0001). Multiple sensitivity analyses of longitudinal and cross-sectional VL data yielded consistent results. These findings can serve as a proof of principle that the gap of ""missing heritability"" in quantitative genetics can be partially bridged by a systematic evaluation of sex-specific associations."
2381,0.002,2.0,"We retrospectively investigated the clinical and histopathologic features of hospitalized patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus who had symptomatic lactic acidosis syndrome at a university teaching hospital during 1995-2000. Twelve patients were identified, 11 during 1998-2000; of these, 5 died with rapid progression to otherwise unexplained multiple-organ failure. All had extensive prior exposure to nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). At presentation, the most commonly identified NRTI component of antiretroviral regimens was stavudine plus didanosine. Eleven patients presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and/or emesis. Eight patients had prior acute weight loss (mean [+/-SD], 12+/-5.3 kg). Median venous plasma lactate levels were > or =2-fold greater than the upper limit of normal (2.1 mmol/L). Serum transaminase levels were near normal limits at presentation. Histopathologic studies confirmed hepatic macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis in 6 patients. Concurrent chemical pancreatitis was identified in 6 patients. The increasing number of cases identified during the study period suggests that physicians better recognize symptomatic lactic acidosis and/or that cumulative NRTI exposure may increase the risk for this syndrome."
8316,0.002,2.0,"In contrast to HIV-infected humans, naturally SIV-infected sooty mangabeys (SMs) very rarely progress to AIDS. Although the mechanisms underlying this disease resistance are unknown, a consistent feature of natural SIV infection is the absence of the generalized immune activation associated with HIV infection. To define the correlates of preserved CD4(+) T cell counts in SMs, we conducted a cross-sectional immunological study of 110 naturally SIV-infected SMs. The nonpathogenic nature of the infection was confirmed by an average CD4(+) T cell count of 1,076 +/- 589/mm(3) despite chronic infection with a highly replicating virus. No correlation was found between CD4(+) T cell counts and either age (used as a surrogate marker for length of infection) or viremia. The strongest correlates of preserved CD4(+) T cell counts were a low percentage of circulating effector T cells (CD28(-)CD95(+) and/or IL-7R/CD127(-)) and a high percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells. These findings support the hypothesis that the level of immune activation is a key determinant of CD4(+) T cell counts in SIV-infected SMs. Interestingly, we identified 14 animals with CD4(+) T cell counts of <500/mm(3), of which two show severe and persistent CD4(+) T cell depletion (<50/mm(3)). Thus, significant CD4(+) T cell depletion does occasionally follow SIV infection of SMs even in the context of generally low levels of immune activation, lending support to the hypothesis of multifactorial control of CD4(+) T cell homeostasis in this model of infection. The absence of AIDS in these ""CD4(low)"" naturally SIV-infected SMs defines a protective role of the reduced immune activation even in the context of a significant CD4(+) T cell depletion."
5740,0.002,2.0,"The atherogenic effects of some highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens, especially those including protease inhibitors (PI), may synergistically promote the acceleration of cardiovascular disease and increase the risk of death from cardiovascular events even in young HIV-infected people. Along with the endothelial dysfunction associated with visceral fat accumulation and related metabolic alterations of HIV-lipodystrophy syndrome (eg, insulin resistance), vascular injury has been associated with HIV-1 infection itself, with an autoimmune reaction to viral infection (vasculitis) and with a direct action of drugs included in HAART regimens. Clinical studies suggest that HIV-infected patients under PI-including HAART and with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors, should be considered at risk for developing coronary artery disease, and that this risk increases with the time of exposure to HAART. A careful cardiovascular screening and monitoring of HIV-infected patients receiving HAART is needed according to the most recent clinical guidelines."
1489,0.002,2.0,"The detection of infectious immune complexes in plasma after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may be useful as a surrogate marker of progression of disease and may help in understanding the pathogenesis of AIDS. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitates of plasma were tested for the presence of HIV p24 antigen and infectious virus. Results were compared with data from cell and plasma cultures, plasma p24 antigen, CD4 cell counts, and stage of disease. PEG precipitation increased the detection rate of the p24 antigen assay from 38.3% to 58.7%. There was a significant correlation between precipitable p24 antigen and plasma viremia, changes in CD4 cell counts, and progression of disease. The sensitivity of the PEG-precipitable p24 antigen assay versus traditional p24 antigen testing was 59.0% and the specificity 91.7%. The assay was reproducible and may be a useful determinant of viral load, clinical progression, and antiretroviral efficacy."
5038,0.002,2.0,"It is well accepted that adaptive immunity plays a key role in the control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In contrast, the contribution of innate immunity has only received attention in recent years. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) sense pathogen-associated molecule patterns and activate antiviral mechanisms, including intracellular antiviral pathways and the production of antiviral effector interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Experimental results from in vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated that TLRs mediate the activation of cellular signaling pathways and the production of antiviral cytokines, resulting in a suppression of HBV replication. However, HBV infection is associated with downregulation of TLR expression on host cells and blockade of the activation of downstream signaling pathways. In primary HBV infection, TLRs may slow down HBV infection, but contribute only indirectly to viral clearance. Importantly, TLRs may modulate HBV-specific T- and B-cell responses in vivo, which are essential for the termination of HBV infection. Thus, TLR agonists are promising candidates to act as immunomodulators for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. Antiviral treatment may recover TLR expression and function in chronic HBV infection and may increase the efficacy of therapeutic approaches based on TLR activation. A combined therapeutic strategy with antiviral treatment and TLR activation could facilitate the restoration of HBV-specific immune responses and thereby, achieve viral clearance in chronically infected HBV patients."
54,0.002,2.0,"The etiology of non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) in renal dialysis patients was determined. Hepatitis C virus was present in many, but its appearance did not correlate with elevated alanine aminotransaminase. When sera from these patients were tested for antibodies against hepatitis B virus (HBV) X antigen and polymerase, 70% were positive. HBV infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using several HBV-specific primer pairs. However, amplification with X region primers failed to yield products in many patients. Cloning and sequencing of these products demonstrated deletions within the X region. Hence, X-deletion variants of HBV are strongly associated with NANBH in renal dialysis patients."
4157,0.002,2.0,"The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy and safety of entecavir in kidney- and liver-transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Ten male transplant patients with chronic HBV infection (eight kidney- and two liver-transplant patients), who have become adefovir (n=9) or lamivudine-resistant (n=1) were given entecavir at 0.5 to 1 mg/d. All patients were HBs Ag positive: six were HBe Ag(-)/HBe Ab(+), and four were HBe Ag(+)/HBe Ab(-). After a median follow-up of 16.5 months, entecavir therapy was associated with a significant decrease in HBV DNA viral load, that is, 3.86 (2.71-6.46) log10 copies/mL at baseline down to 2.94 (2.15-4) log10 copies/mL at last follow-up (P=0.004). Rate of HBV DNA clearance was 50% in both HBeAg(+) and HBeAg(-) patients. There were no significant changes in renal function or hematological parameters. This study demonstrates that entecavir therapy is safe and efficient in HBV(+) organ-transplant patients."

2193,0.002,2.0,"Before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) represented one of the most prevalent causes of focal brain lesions in HIV-infected people. The prognosis of PCNSL was very poor, with median survival time not exceeding 2 months. Brain biopsy was the method of choice for the definitive diagnosis, but it was and remains an invasive procedure with morbidity and mortality as well as considerable costs in terms of patients' management and quality of life. The strict association between AIDS-PCNSL and Epstein-Barr virus led to the suggestion that EBV DNA in cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) might serve as a diagnostic marker, reducing the time required for diagnosis and allowing a minimally invasive approach. The clinical usefulness of this methodology has been largely demonstrated through clinical practice. After the introduction of HAART in clinical practice, a survival benefit has been observed for most persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated opportunistic infections and cancers. In particular, for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a higher likelihood of response to chemotherapy as well as a longer survival has been found as a consequence of the use of combined antiretroviral therapy. Although larger studies did not show significant changes in survival of HIV-infected patients with PCNSL in the era of HAART, small case series and anecdotal reports showed the benefit of HAART in the treatment of PCNSL. Nevertheless, these patients' survival still remains very poor and it could be hypothesized that, other than specific cancer prognostic determinants and severe immunodeficiency, viral pathogenesis as well as EBV-specific immunologic dysfunction may be responsible."
3340,0.002,2.0,"The aim of this study is to investigate adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who are homeless or unstably housed. We evaluated homeless or unstably housed PLWHA (n=644) in three US cities were enrolled in the Housing and Health Study. Using baseline data and controlling for gender, race, age, and education, we examined associations between self-reported two- and Seven-day adherence and access to healthcare, mental health, substance use, and attitudes toward HIV medical therapy. Of the 644 participants, 358 (55%) were currently on HAART. For two-day adherence, 280 (78%) reported missing no prescribed doses (100% adherence), and for seven-day adherence, 291 (81%) reported > or =90% adherence. Logistic regression analyses indicated being younger, not having health insurance, and drug use were associated with missing > or =1 dose over the past two days. Scoring lower on SF-36 mental component summary scale and having greater risk of depression (CES-D) and stress (Perceived Stress Scale) were associated with poorer adherence for both two- and seven-day outcomes. Negative attitudes toward HIV treatment were also associated with lower adherence. Adherence to HIV medications in this population is similar to other groups. Coexisting problems of access to healthcare, higher risk of mental health problems, along with poorer attitudes toward treatment are associated with increased likelihood of missing doses. Comprehensive models of HIV care that include a continuum of medical and social services are essential for treating this population."
800,0.002,2.0,"AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (AKS) is particularly aggressive and it is one of the principal neoplasms in regions of Africa affected by both high endemic HHV8 and epidemic HIV infection. In this study, serum samples from 18 patients with Kaposi's sarcoma from Tanzania, mostly males (n = 15 vs 3), were subjected to analysis with respect to HHV8-DNA load and antibody spectrum against the HIV-1 tat protein. Of the 18 patients, 14 were HIV-1-positive. The median HHV8 virus load in the HIV-1-positive group was 2075 DNA copies/ml, compared to 450 copies/ml in the HIV-1-negative group. In the HIV-1-positive group, the males had a higher HHV8-DNA virus load as compared to females (median: 4600 vs 1400 genome copies per ml). Since tat can promote AKS development (4-6) by intercellular signalling pathways, and these signals can be abolished by anti-tat IgG (7-9), we have examined the anti-tat IgG spectrum in this study. It would be expected that the levels of serum HHV8-DNA are higher in KS patients who have low anti-tat IgG titer, or who are anti-tat IgG-negative. In the present study, seven out of fifteen AKS patients were positive for anti-tat IgG. Although, we have not seen a strict quantitative relationship between serum anti-tat IgG and HHV8-DNA levels, our data appear to suggest a correlation between the two parameters. In view of these observations and the published data, we suggest that cross-signalling pathways between the tat protein and HHV8-DNA are involved in the complexity of pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma."
5589,0.002,2.0,"To investigate the infectivity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from mothers to their newborn offspring, HBV-DNA in plasma and peripheral mononuclear cells from 28 antihepatitis Be positive, hepatitis B surface antigen positive carrier mothers was examined by a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction/Southern hybridisation technique. HBV specific DNA was detected in three maternal mononuclear cell samples, but was absent in plasma. Two of four infants born to the three mothers with HBV-DNA positive mononuclear cells developed acute or fulminant hepatitis within three months after birth. Two infants were effectively prevented from infection with HBV by combined hepatitis B immunoglobulin/HBV vaccine administration. The 25 infants born to the HBV-DNA negative mothers were free of HBV infection within the next seven months to 3.5 years. These results suggest that latent infection with HBV in maternal mononuclear cells is responsible for perinatal HBV infection."
5834,0.002,2.0,"Aim of the study was to investigate serological markers of selected sexually and blood transmitted infections (HBV, HCV, CMV, and Treponema pallidum) in the group of pregnant women and in newborns of HIV-positive mothers in Slovakia. IgG antibodies to CMV were found in 78 of 97 women, from them in 6 of 7 HIV-positive and in 72 of 90 HIV-negative persons. Occurrence of HbsAg and HCV was significantly higher in the group of HIV-positive women (1/7 and 2/7) comparing to the HIV-negative one (4/90 and 0/92, respectively). Antibodies to T. pallidum were found only in one HIV-negative woman from 92 women tested. Five of seven children born to HIV-1 infected mothers were found HIV-1 negative, two children are still under control. Four of 7 newborns were found anti-CMV IgG positive. Although one woman, IDU, was confirmed HbsAg and anti-HCV positive, vertical transmission of HBV and HCV to her newborn was not observed by molecular-biological methods. Similarly, HCV antibodies were found in one more women and neither in her child HCV infection was confirmed. In no one of mother - child pair's antibodies to T. pallidum were observed. Due to these findings strong attention should be paid to health education and prophylaxis of mother to child HIV and other STIs transmission in Slovakia."
6712,0.002,2.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection imposes an enormous public health burden. In patients with chronic hepatitis and high levels of viral replication, inhibitors of the virus polymerase can reduce serum titre and favourably affect the inflammatory process in the liver. Lamivudine, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, is the first nucleoside analogue to be licensed for treatment of chronic HBV infection. Treatment effects a rapid and profound decrease of serum virus titre, with attendant clinical benefit. Unfortunately drug-resistant species may emerge after 6 months of suppressive therapy. Lamivudine-resistant species have specific amino acid substitutions in the HBV-encoded polymerase. Emergence of these species is frequently associated with loss of clinical benefit. Published data suggest that lamivudine-resistant species exhibit cross-resistance to famciclovir, thereby limiting the potential use of famciclovir with lamivudine as combination therapy. Adefovir is under clinical evaluation for treatment of wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV. Preliminary data suggest that adefovir achieves potent inhibition of both species. Studies of drug resistance have followed hot-on-the-heels of the development of potent antiviral therapy for chronic HBV."
3118,0.002,2.0,"Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanism of this association is unclear. In this study, we examined the potential defects in upstream insulin signaling pathways in liver specimens obtained from nonobese/nondiabetic subjects with HCV infection. Fasting liver biopsy specimens were obtained from 42 HCV-infected subjects and 10 non-HCV-infected subjects matched for age and body mass index. Liver tissues were exposed to insulin and examined for the contents and phosphorylation/activation status of the upstream insulin signaling molecules by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. HCV infection resulted in a trend toward a 2-fold to 3-fold increase in insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 contents when compared with non-HCV. In contrast, insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was decreased by 2-fold in HCV-infected subjects compared with non-HCV-infected subjects (P <.05). The observed reductions in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation were accompanied by a 3.4-fold decrease in IRS-1/p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) association and a 2.5-fold decrease in IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase enzymatic activity (P <.05 vs. non-HCV). This was accompanied by a marked reduction in insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation without any alterations in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. Cellular contents of the hepatic p85 subunit of PI3-kinase were comparable between HCV-infected and non-HCV-infected subjects. In conclusion, we found that (1). HCV infection leads to a postreceptor defect in IRS-1 association with the IR and (2). insulin signaling defects in hepatic IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3-kinase association/activation may contribute to insulin resistance, which leads to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with HCV infection."
6136,0.002,2.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), use of insulin and statins was associated with reduced cancer risk while co-presence of low LDL cholesterol (LDLC <2.8 mmol/l) plus low triglyceride (TG; <1.7 mmol/l) increased cancer risk. There is experimental evidence showing that insulin insufficiency might promote HCC. In this study, we examined whether this lipid subphenotype and use of insulin or statins might modify the promoting effect of chronic HBV infection (indicated by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen) on HCC. We analyzed data of 1319 T2D patients enrolled into the Hong Kong Diabetes Registry from December 1996 to January 2005 and followed up to 2005. Additive interaction was estimated using relative excess risk due to interaction and attributable proportion due to interaction. During 5782 person-years of follow-up, 1.74% (n=23) of patients developed HCC (incidence, 3.98; 95% confidence interval, 2.36-5.60/1000 person-years). HbA1c ≥7.0% and the lipid phenotype (LDLC <2.8 mmol/l plus TG <1.7 mmol/l) increased the hazard ratios (HRs) of chronic HBV infection for HCC from 3.74 to 74.96 and from 11.01 to 89.82 respectively with significant interactions. Use of insulin or statins decreased the HRs from 37.51 to 5.87 and from 64.94 to 16.99 respectively with significant interactions (all P values <0.05). These findings support our hypothesis that hyperglycemia and co-presence of low LDLC plus low TG might enhance, while insulin or statin usage might attenuate the promoting effect of chronic HBV infection on HCC in T2D."
2224,0.002,2.0,"CXCR4 is the major co-receptor used by X4 strains of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). In HIV-1-infected patients, the appearance of X4 strains (T cell line-tropic) correlates with disease progression. Since its discovery, the CXCR4 co-receptor has been a major target for different agents which block its function, such as stromal-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) and the anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody, 12G5. In the present studies, the 12G5 hybridoma was used to construct a single-chain variable antibody fragment (SFv). Murine leukemia virus (MLV) and simian virus 40 (SV(40)) were utilized as delivery vehicles for the anti-CXCR4 SFv. Intracellular expression of the anti-CXCR4 SFv led to down-regulation of this critical co-receptor, as demonstrated by immunostaining. This effect significantly and specifically protected transduced cells from challenge with HIV-1, as measured by HIV-1 p24 antigen expression. Inhibition of HIV-1 replication was specific for X4 HIV-1 strains as demonstrated by MAGI assays. HeLa-CD4/betagal-CCR5 cells expressing the anti-CXCR4 SFv showed significant inhibition of infectivity by the X4 HIV-1 strain NL4-3, but not with the R5 HIV-1 strain Bal. Thus, this anti-HIV-1 molecular therapy has the potential to inhibit HIV-1 replication and virion spread. Targeting CXCR4 by intracellular immunization could be of additional benefit to certain HIV-1-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)."
9466,0.002,2.0,"The pressing need for broad-spectrum antivirals could be met by targeting host rather than viral processes. Cholesterol biosynthesis within the infected cell is one promising target for a large number of viral systems, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV. Liposomes developed for intracellular, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted in vivo drug delivery have been modified to include polyunsaturated fatty acids that exert an independent antiviral activity through the reduction of cellular cholesterol. These polyunsaturated ER liposomes (PERLs) have greater activity than lovastatin (Mevacor, Altoprev), which is clinically approved for lowering cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease. Treatment of HCV, HBV, and HIV infections with PERLs significantly decreased viral secretion and infectivity, and pretreatment of naïve cells reduced the ability of both HCV and HIV to establish infections because of the decreased levels of plasma membrane cholesterol. Direct competition for cellular receptors was an added effect of PERLs against HCV infections. The greatest antiviral activity in all three systems was the inhibition of viral infectivity through the reduction of virus-associated cholesterol. Our study demonstrates that PERLs are a broadly effective antiviral therapy and should be developed further in combination with encapsulated drug mixtures for enhanced in vivo efficacy."
260,0.002,2.0,"In this study, we report on the efficacy of using a spleen necrosis virus (SNV)-based vector delivery system to block human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) replication in human hematopoietic cells. These efforts were directed towards the development of human immune system cell resistance to HIV-1 infection, based on the strategy of ""intracellular immunization"" via generation of a series of anti-HIV-1 therapeutic constructs carrying scFvs, single-chain variable fragments, against HIV-1 integrase and reverse transcriptase in combination with the trans-dominant mutant of HIV-1 Rev, RevM10. The efficiency of the anti-HIV-1 constructs were tested in viral challenge assays with different doses of HIV-1 NL4-3, Bal, 89.6 and R7-GFP strains. These experiments demonstrated the reduction of HIV-1 replication by these retroviral vector constructs in a range of 4- to 10-fold in CD4+ T-lymphocytes, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and primary human macrophages. We observed selective efficiency of SNV-based therapeutics in H9, C8166 and Jurkat T-lymphocytic cell lines, demonstrating the most efficient inhibition of HIV-1 replication in Jurkat T-cells. Thus, these data are the first demonstration of the ability of SNV-based retroviral vectors with select transgenes, which may have certain molecular advantages over other retroviral vector systems, to combat HIV-1 replication in human hematopoietic cells and support the potential for using SNV-expressed constructs in anti-HIV-1 molecular therapeutics."
2529,0.002,2.0,"Although newer and more effective treatments are now available for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, non-HCV viral hepatitis remains an important cause of liver disease, especially among HIV-infected individuals. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of cirrhosis worldwide, and approximately one-quarter of patients with cirrhosis develop decompensated liver disease within 5 years. Initial treatment for chronic HBV infection includes peginterferon alfa, entecavir, and tenofovir. Approximately 15 million of the estimated 350 million individuals with chronic HBV infection have evidence of exposure to hepatitis D (delta) virus (HDV), which requires hepatitis B surface antigen for transmission and packaging. HBV/HDV coinfection is associated with more severe acute hepatitis and higher mortality than acute HBV monoinfection. Chronic coinfection is associated with a higher risk of cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease. The mainstay of treatment for HDV infection is peginterferon alfa for at least 48 weeks. Cases of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in HIV-infected persons have been reported. HEV infection can become chronic in immunosuppressed patients, and chronic infection is associated with rapid development of cirrhosis. There are no established guidelines for treating HEV infection in HIV-infected persons. This article summarizes a presentation by Jennifer Price, MD, at the IAS-USA continuing education program held in San Francisco, California, in June 2013. "
7110,0.002,2.0,"Forty-five antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 infected patients and 14 healthy controls in North China were enrolled in this study. The frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and levels of expression of CD95, HLA-DR and CD38 in T cells were detected by flow cytometry. We found that the frequency of Tregs was higher in AIDS patients than in asymptomatic HIV-1 infected patients (P=0.004). The frequency of Tregs was significantly correlated with absolute CD4 count, viral load, CD4+CD95+ T cells and CD8+CD95+ T cells (P<0.05). The relationship between the frequency of Tregs and immune activation was not found in HIV-infected patients. We concluded that the frequency of Tregs in HIV-infected Chinese patients was significantly correlated with disease progression."

HHV-6 and HCMV were assessed in the peripheral blood leukocytes of 26 lung transplant recipients and of 37 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, to determine the degree of concordance between HHV-6 and HCMV reactivation in different biologic settings. In the lung transplant recipients (145 samples), HHV-6 was not detected, even though 44 (30%) of 145 samples were from 9 HCMV DNA-positive patients (13 episodes of HCMV pneumonitis). Among the HIV-infected patients (172 samples), HCMV DNA was detected in 29 (17%) of 172 samples from 10 patients (4 episodes of HCMV disease). HHV-6 DNA was detected in 2 HIV-infected patients who did not have HCMV detected at that time. These findings suggest that the pathobiologic control mechanisms for these 2 beta-herpesviruses may be significantly different."

With the recent advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), those infected with HIV are now living longer and dying from illnesses other than acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although studies prior to the HAART era suggested poor outcomes might occur with transplantation in those infected with HIV, more recent studies have demonstrated results comparable to those of recipients without HIV infection. A number of issues persist regarding ethics, patient selection, post-operative management, and drug interactions between antiretroviral and immunosuppression agents.

Eight hundred and eight members (56% neurologists, 43% physiatrists; 97% practicing physicians, 3% trainees) responded, with a response rate of 22% (808 of 3659). The mean number of years in practice, involving electromyography (EMG) at least 1 day per week, was 16 years. A majority of physicians (64%) reported at least one needlestick injury involving EMG, and 8% reported five or more injuries. Needlestick injuries involving patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), hepatitis B, and/or hepatitis C occurred in 1 of every 11 electromyographers. Nearly half of all respondents (44%) who experienced a needlestick injury stated that they did not report at least one injury event to official centers. Injuries were most likely to occur during a routine procedure (45%) or when a patient moved (26%). The most common preventable reason for injury was a perceived lack of time."
2054,0.002,2.0,"Human DNA flanking sites of eight human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral integrations have been analyzed in isolates derived both from integrations in an infected individual and from tissue culture. Sequence analysis encompassing 80-3000 bp of human DNA on one or both sides of the site of integration revealed that seven of the eight HIV-1 proviruses had integrated directly into or within one nucleosome's distance from an L1Hs or Alu repetitive element. To compare this with the frequency at which human L1 or Alu elements sharing > or = 70% identity with L1Hs and Alu consensus sequences would be encountered at random, > 200 bp from each of 82 individual anonymously cloned segments of human DNA were sequenced: L1Hs elements were encountered in 8.5% of the 82 clones and Alu elements were encountered in 13.4+ by using these homology windows. From these data it appears that HIV-1 integrates into or near L1Hs elements with an approximately 6-fold higher frequency than would be expected if HIV-1 integration events were distributed uniformly throughout the genome. A cumulative binomial probability test shows that there is a 0.26% chance that one would arrive at these figures by chance and puts the data well within a 99% confidence interval. We propose that sites of L1Hs and Alu insertions originally occurred in regions of chromatin that were more easily accessible to the retroposon machinery and that these regions are now acting as preferred integration sites for HIV-1."
1369,0.002,2.0,"Sequences at the ends of linear retroviral cDNA important for integration define the viral DNA attachment (att) site. Whereas determinants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase important for replication in T lymphocytes have been extensively characterized, regions of the att site important for viral spread have not been thoroughly examined. Previous transposon-mediated footprinting of preintegration complexes isolated from infected cells revealed enhanced regions of bacteriophage Mu insertion near the ends of HIV-1 cDNA, in the regions of the att sites. Here, we identified the subterminal cDNA sequences cleaved during in vitro footprinting and used this structure-based information together with results of previous work to construct and characterize 24 att site mutant viruses. We found that although subterminal cDNA sequences contributed to HIV-1 replication, the identities of these bases were not critical for integration. In contrast, the phylogenetically conserved CA dinucleotides located at the ends of HIV-1 contributed significantly to virus replication and integration. Mutants containing one intact CA end displayed delays in peak virus growth compared to the wild type. In contrast, double mutant viruses lacking both CAs were replication defective. The A of the CA appeared to be the most critical determinant of integration, because two different U5 mutant viruses containing the substitution of TG for CA partially reverted by changing the G back to A. We also identified a U5 deletion mutant in which the CA played a crucial role in reverse transcription."

After 28 days, 54 responding subjects entered an open-label extension that allowed for the addition of nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase and dose escalation to maintain durability. The drug was well-tolerated and demonstrated robust antiviral activity, with demonstrable superiority of the 750 mg and 1000 mg three times daily regimens. Thirty subjects who continued to receive therapy at 12 months attained a persistent 1.6 log10 reduction in HIV RNA, accompanied by a mean increase in CD4 cells of 180-200/mm3. Studies of viral genotype and phenotype after virus rebound revealed that the initial active site mutation allowing for nelfinavir resistance is mediated by a unique amino acid substitution in the HIV-1 protease D30N, which does not confer in vitro phenotypic cross-resistance to the currently available protease inhibitors."
5316,0.002,2.0,"The prognosis of decompensated cirrhosis of liver resulting from chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection is poor and liver transplantation is the only established mode of treatment. The benefits of treatment with interferon are outweighed by serious side effects and risks of fatal exacerbation of disease activity. Lamivudine rapidly reduces hepatitis B viral DNA in serum to undetectable levels. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effectiveness and safety of Lamivudine treatment in patients with advanced and end stage liver disease caused by Hepatitis B. This was a prospective observational study in which a total of 45 patients, 39 (87.0%) male and 6 (13.0%) female who had viral activity and child pugh score e"" 8 were given Lamivudine 100 mg orally once daily. Among them 30 patients completed at least 6 months of therapy, majority (27 patients) showed improvement in liver function with decrease in serum ALT from mean (+/- SD) 118.8 +/- 106.5 to 50.2 +/- 57.1 U/L (p < 0.001), decrease in serum bilirubin from 73.9 +/- 80.5 to 44.7 +/- 62.9 micromol/l (p = 0.129), increase in serum albumin from 26.2 +/- 4.2 to 33.2 +/- 3.4 g/l (p < 0.05), decrease in prothrombin time from 8.3 +/- 4.0 to 3.9 +/- 2.9 seconds prolonged (p < 0.05) and reduction in child pugh score from 11.0 +/- 1.7 to 7.0 +/- 1.3 (p < 0.001). Seroconversion was found in 5 (11.1%) patients on Intention to treat analysis. Among the seroconverted group, 1 (2.2%) patient also lost HBsAg. Six (13.0%) patient had procore mutant virus, 2 (4.4%) of them showed virological response. Therefore, total 7 (15.5%) patients showed virological response by intention to treat analysis. We conclude that inhibition of viral replication with Lamivudine results in a significant improvement of liver function in patients with decompensated cirrhosis of liver due to HBV infection."
3718,0.002,2.0,"Phylogenetic analysis was used to study in vivo genetic variation of the V3 region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in relation to disease progression in six infants with vertically acquired human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. Nucleotide sequences from each infant formed a monophyletic group with similar average branch lengths separating the sets of sequences. In contrast to the star-shaped phylogeny characteristic of interinfant viral evolution, the shape of the phylogeny formed by sequences from the infants who developed AIDS tended to be linear. A computer program, DISTRATE, was written to analyze changes in DNA distance values over time. For the six infants, the rate of divergence from the initial variant was inversely correlated with CD4 cell counts averaged over the first 11 to 15 months of life (r = -0.87, P = 0.024). To uncover evolutionary relationships that might be dictated by protein structure and function, tree-building methods were applied to inferred amino acid sequences. Trees constructed from the full-length protein fragment (92 amino acids) showed that viruses from each infant formed a monophyletic group. Unexpectedly, V3 loop protein sequences (35 amino acids) that were found at later time points from the two infants who developed AIDS clustered together. Furthermore, these sequences uniquely shared amino acids that have been shown to confer a T-cell line tropic phenotype. The evolutionary pattern suggests that viruses from these infants with AIDS acquired similar and possibly more virulent phenotypes."
5023,0.002,2.0,"To assess the interaction of alcohol, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in hepatocarcinogenesis, we prospectively observed 449 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) who presented to our outpatient clinics in 1 month; 164 patients with habitual drinking [alcoholic liver-liver cirrhosis (AL-LC)] who had taken > 72 g alcohol/day (HCV-positive 81 cases: HCV + AL; HCV-negative 83 cases: AL); 176 patients with HCV infection, but without alcohol intake: 34 patients with HBV infection: 6 patients with HCV and HBV coinfection; and 82 patients with liver diseases from other etiologies, such as primary biliary cirrhosis. In the HCV group, the cumulative occurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 9%, 18%, and 23% in the first, second, and third years, respectively. In the HCV + AL group, that was 13%, 17%, and 28%, respectively. There was no difference in the HCC occurrence rate between the two groups. In the AL group, the cumulative HCC occurrence rate was only 1% during the observation period of 3 years. The occurrence rate was significantly lower in the AL group, compared with the HCV and the HCV + AL groups. In the HBV group, the cumulative occurrence rate of HCC during the observation period of 3 years was 17%, which was similar to that of the HBV + AL group, 14%. We also examined some other variables that might be related to the development of HCC. The cumulative occurrence rate of HCC in male patients was 31%, whereas that was 18% in female patients. In the HCV group, there was a significant increase of HCC occurrence rate in male patients. In contrast, no difference was observed in the HCC occurrence rate between male and female patients in the HBV group. The present study suggests that alcohol alone may not be an independent risk factor for HCC, nor does it accelerate HCC development in LC patients with HCV and HBV infection during the prospective observation of 3 years."
6095,0.002,2.0,"The process of T-cell activation in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers has been investigated by measurement of membrane expression of lymphocyte-activation markers in response to a variety of mitogenic stimuli in order to delineate further the abnormality of T-cell-mediated immunity present in such patients. A substantial proportion of unstimulated T cells from the peripheral blood of patients but not controls expressed HLA-DR; in contrast the IL-2 and transferrin receptors were rarely expressed spontaneously in either group and there was no difference in spontaneous lymphocyte transformation. After stimulation with monocyte-dependent T-cell mitogens, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) or anti-T3, patients had significantly reduced expression of the IL-2 and transferrin receptors and of HLA-DR in association with impaired lymphocyte transformations compared to controls. In contrast, lymphocyte activation was normal in response to the monocyte-independent T-cell mitogen phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA). These data confirm that the process of T-cell activation is abnormal in chronic HBV carriers but suggest that the T cell is intrinsically normal. In allogeneic co-cultures, monocytes from patients inhibited the transformation of normal and patients' lymphocytes in response to PHA, suggesting that defects of T-cell-mediated immunity in chronic HBV carriers may be a consequence of monocyte dysfunction."
5568,0.002,2.0,"Initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with low CD4 counts or AIDS-defining illnesses (ADIs) increases risk of treatment failure and death. We examined factors associated with late initiation among 18- to 29-year-olds within the Canadian Observational Cohort (CANOC) collaboration, a multi-site study of HIV-positive persons who initiated HAART after 2000. Late initiation was defined as beginning HAART with a CD4 count <200 cells/mm(3) and/or having a baseline ADI. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent correlates of late initiation. In total, 1026 individuals (422 from British Columbia, 400 from Ontario, and 204 from Quebec) met our age criteria. At HAART initiation, median age was 27 years (interquartile range, 24, 28 years). A total of 412 individuals (40%) identified as late initiators. Late initiation was associated with female gender, age >25 years at initiation, initiating treatment in earlier years, and having higher baseline viral load. The high number of young adults in our cohort starting HAART late indicates important target populations for specialized services, increased testing, and linkages to care. "
8150,0.002,2.0,"Patients in whom virologic suppression is achieved with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) retain long-lived cellular reservoirs of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1); this retention is an obstacle to sustained control of infection. To assess the impact that initiating treatment during primary HIV-1 infection has on this cell population, we analyzed the decay kinetics of HIV-1 DNA and of infectivity associated with cells activated ex vivo in 27 patients who initiated therapy before or <6 months after seroconversion and in whom viremia was suppressed to <50 copies/mL. The clearance rates of cellular reservoirs could not be distinguished by these techniques (median half-life, 20 weeks) during the first year of HAART. The clearance of HIV-1 DNA slowed significantly during the subsequent 3 years of treatment (median half-life, 70 weeks), consistent with heterogeneous cellular reservoirs being present. Total cell-associated infectivity (CAI) after 1 year of treatment was undetectable (<0.07 infectious units/million cells [IUPM]) in most patients initiating treatment during primary infection either before (9/9) or <6 months after (6/8) seroconversion. In contrast, all 17 control patients who initiated HAART during chronic infection retained detectable CAI after 3-6 years of treatment (median reservoir size, 1.1 IUPM; P<.0005). These results suggest that treatment <6 months after seroconversion may facilitate long-term control of cellular reservoirs that maintain HIV-1 infection during treatment."
7609,0.002,2.0,"Opportunistic diseases cause substantial morbidity and mortality to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) leading to immune reconstitution is the most effective treatment of preventing opportunistic diseases. This retrospective study established an epidemiologic profile of opportunistic diseases 10 years after the introduction of HAART. The HIV antiretroviral therapy-naive patients matching inclusion criteria were included. The primary outcome was the prevalence of opportunistic diseases. From January 1, 2002 to September 30, 2010, 654 opportunistic diseases were identified in 458 patients. Pulmonary tuberculosis, herpes zoster, cerebral toxoplasmosis, oral candidiasis, and severe pneumonia accounted for 22.05%, 15.94%, 14.19%, 14.19%, and 9.39%, respectively. Cryptococcal meningitis and pneumocystosis accounted for 0.44% and 0.21%, respectively. The prevalence of opportunistic diseases in Gabon remains high. New guidelines emphasize the importance of initiating antiretroviral therapy early to reconstitute the immune system, and reduce disease risk, and treat the primary opportunistic infection of pulmonary tuberculosis."
5448,0.002,2.0,"Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an increasingly recognized phenomenon of paradoxical worsening of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) upon initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). To date, there have been limited reports of IRIS in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, the authors describe a 43-year-old man with AIDS who presented with subacute meningitis. No pathogenic organism was identified by routine diagnostic tests, and he was treated empirically with an antituberculous regimen and initiated on HAART therapy. Soon after, he had a precipitous neurologic decline leading to his death. Postmortem evaluation showed a basilar Candida meningitis as well as vasculitis characterized by CD8+ T-cell infiltration, consistent with IRIS. The authors discuss the challenges in diagnosing fungal meningitides and the risks of initiating HAART therapy in those with possible undiagnosed underlying opportunistic infections. Additionally, the authors review the literature regarding CNS IRIS."
1160,0.002,2.0,"The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the psychosocial changes revealed by persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in western Uganda as a result of the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Fourteen participants were interviewed on two occasions. Two focus groups discussions were also conducted. Patients experienced important personal benefits as a result of HAART and the resulting clinical improvement. These benefits included a restoration of hope, self-esteem and personal agency. Patients were also relieved of the great fear which they had about the conditions of their death. The financial and social struggles introduced by AIDS illness continued after the introduction of HAART. The conclusion is that the HAART programs should provide more holistic care to patients to address the persistent family issues identified in this study. "

8854,0.002,2.0,"Although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been a major global health problem for almost 3 decades, with the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996 and effective prophylaxis and management of opportunistic infections, mortality from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has decreased markedly. In developed countries, this condition is now being treated as a chronic condition. As a result, rates of morbidity and mortality from other medical conditions leading to end-stage liver, kidney, and heart disease are steadily increasing in individuals with HIV. Because the definitive treatment for end-stage organ failure is transplantation, the demand for it has increased among HIV-infected patients. For these reasons, many transplant centers have eliminated HIV infection as a contraindication to transplantation, as a result of better patient management and demand."
1690,0.002,2.0,"Recent advances in the knowledge of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication and transmission as well as the emergence of effective antiretroviral therapies are leading to longer survival times for HIV-infected individuals. As a result, organ related manifestations of late stage HIV infection, including HIV-related heart diseases have emerged. It is now clear that cardiac involvement in HIV seropositive patients is relatively common and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cardiac involvement in HIV infection is multifactorial. The epidemiology has changed dramatically since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), but studies carried out before the introduction of HAART remain relevant because of limited access to this treatment in many areas of the world. A variety of cardiac lesions have been reported in HIV infection and AIDS, including pericardial disease with effusion and tamponade, nonspecific or infectious myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy with global left ventricular dysfunction, endocardial valvular disease due to marantic or infective endocarditis, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension and neoplastic invasion. In the post HAART-era, coronary artery disease and dyslipidaemia, drug related cardiotoxicity and cardiac autonomic dysfunction are becoming increasingly prevalent. In this review, we highlight the importance of cardiac complications in HIV disease and discuss measures that can be taken to improve survival."

Of 6,095 patients, 13.8% were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg(+)) and 17.0% were positive for anti-HCV (anti-HCV(+)). Infection was found to be inversely related to educational level and to be directly related to the frequency of the receipt of parenteral injection for medical purposes. Risk factors for HBsAg positivity were male sex, age < or = 50 years, and a family history of hepatocellular carcinoma. Risk factors for HCV seropositivity were lower education level, frequent parenteral injections, blood transfusion, menial occupations, smoking, and age > 50 years. Therefore, risk factors for HBsAg(+) and anti-HCV(+) were different in these Taiwanese communities. Safe medical injections and improved health education for high-risk groups are imperative for preventing HCV transmission."

Three hundred and thirteen of 325 students (96%) participated. The mean age was 24.3+/-3.98 years; 231 (74%) were pre-clinical students and 82 (26%) were in the clinical years of study. Only 8 (2.6%) had received three doses of vaccination against HBV. Eighty-one (26%) tested positive for anti-HBc, 10 (3.2%) were positive for HBsAg and 56 (17.9%) had anti-HBs antibodies. A significant relationship was found between students who had a positive history of hepatitis B in the family and anti-HBc (P=0.03). Age was also significantly associated with HBsAg (P=0.012). Two hundred and twenty-five (72%) students were susceptible to the infection and required vaccination. Most students at this medical school are susceptible to HBV infection and should be vaccinated."
6952,0.002,2.0,"The plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA load is used in the clinical routine for the monitoring of HIV infection and the patient's response to antiretroviral therapy. Other body fluids or dried blood spots (DBS) can be used, however, to assess the level of viremia. The use of DBS may be especially helpful for the monitoring of HIV-infected patients in resource-poor settings, where access to adequate laboratory facilities is often difficult. However, the correlation between the HIV RNA levels in plasma and those in DBSs has not been well established. Paired plasma and DBS samples obtained from HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients were tested for HIV RNA copy numbers by using two different commercial assays, the Nuclisens EasyQ HIV-1 (version 1.1) test (the Nuclisens test; Biomerieux) and the m2000rt RealTime HIV test (the m2000rt test; Abbott). Nucleic acid extraction was performed manually by using either the Nuclisens isolation kit (which uses the Boom methodology) or the m2000rt sample preparation kit (an iron particle-based method). A total of 103 paired plasma and DBS samples were tested. Viral load results were obtained for 97 (94.2%) samples with the Nuclisens isolation kit and 81 (78.6%) samples with the m2000rt kit. The overall correlation between the RNA loads in plasma and DBS was good, although better results were obtained by the Nuclisens test (R(2) = 0.87, P < 0.001) than by the m2000rt test (R(2) = 0.70, P < 0.001). While the specificities were excellent and similar for both the Nuclisens and the m2000rt tests (97.1% and 100%, respectively), the sensitivity was greater by the Nuclisens test than by the m2000rt test (75.8% and 56.6%, respectively). Overall, the viral loads in DBS tended to be lower than those in plasma, with mean differences of 0.3 log unit (standard deviation, 0.5 log unit) and 0.76 log unit (standard deviation, 0.8 log unit) for the Nuclisens and the m2000rt tests, respectively. The levels of agreement between the measurements in plasma and DBS were assessed by using the Bland-Altman plot for each assay. The Nuclisens test gave results within its defined limits (-0.65 to 1.26) for 95.9% of the samples, while the m2000rt test gave results within its limits (-0.83 to 2.33) for 100% of the samples. In summary, the HIV-1 load can accurately be quantified by testing DBS by either the Nuclisens or the m2000rt test, although the Nuclisens test may outperform the m2000rt test when nucleic acids are extracted manually."

Several structural investigations have already been reported to reveal the molecular mechanism of the drug resistance. As full length crystal structure for HIV-1 integrase is still unsolved, we herein use the crystal structure of the full length prototype foamy virus (PFV) in complex with virus DNA and inhibitor Elvitegravir as a template to construct the wild type and E92Q/N155H mutant system of HIV-1 integrase. Molecular dynamic simulations was used to revel the binding mode and the drug resistance of the EVG ligand in E92Q/N155H. Several important interactions were discovered between the mutated residues and the residues in the active site of the E92Q/N155H double mutant pattern, and cross correlation and clustering methods were used for detailed analysis. The results from the MD simulation studies will be used to guide the experimental efforts of developing novel inhibitors against drug-resistant HIV integrase mutants. "

All 14 patients participated in a pharmacokinetic study in which they were hospitalized for an entire day. As a child's ability to concentrate varies over the course of the day, all tests were performed in the morning.The patients' neurocognitive development did not significantly differ from the normative collective pattern for any of the following composite scores that were examined: full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) (mean: 106.5, P = .1060), verbal comprehension index (mean: 106.0, P = .1356), perceptual reasoning index (mean: 106.0, P = .1357), working memory index (mean: 106.3, P = .1171), and processing speed index (mean: 98.1, P = .6313). The overall full-scale IQ scores were significantly higher in children who began ART within the first year of life (P = .0379), whereas low lopinavir/r plasma levels (P = .0070) and high viral load area under the curves (AUCs) in the first 3 years of life, but not later, significantly correlated with reduced neurocognitive performance (Spearman r = -0.64, P = .0278).In this cohort of cART treated HIV-positive children and adolescents, neurocognitive performance correlated with early and sufficient viral load suppression within the first 3 years of life."
7344,0.002,2.0,"Serum p24 antigen levels were examined in subjects from three clinical trials of zidovudine to determine whether the pattern of change in serum p24 antigen during the first 8-16 weeks of therapy was associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) disease progression or death. Among 406 patients with AIDS and a first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, 65% had measurable pretreatment concentrations of serum p24 antigen (> or = 10 pg/mL). Changes during treatment were not associated with reduced mortality. In 637 mildly symptomatic patients, 24% had measurable concentrations, and changes were marginally associated with increased time until more advanced disease. Among 683 asymptomatic patients, 18% had measurable concentrations, and changes were not associated with increased time until progression. Despite the small number of clinical events and the low rate of serum p24 antigen positivity in the latter two studies, pretreatment serum p24 antigen levels were predictive of clinical outcome; subsequent measurements appear to be of limited use in evaluating zidovudine therapy."
36,0.002,2.0,"There is increasing evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection of an immunosuppressed host is associated with the appearance of virus mutants. To characterize the virus circulating in patients in detail, eleven full-length HBV genomes, isolated from the serum of five highly viraemic renal transplant recipients with liver disease, were cloned and sequenced. The genomes contained deletions in the C gene, deletions in the pre-S1/2 region frequently removing the pre-S2 initiation codon, premature termination codons in the pre-S1 or S region, and/or deletions/insertions in the X gene/core promoter. The mutations occurred at different positions and in various combinations; even mutant genomes circulating within a patient differed strikingly. It is concluded that long-term immunosuppression is associated with the occurrence of heterogeneous populations of partially defective HBV characterized by a specific mutation pattern. Efficient intracellular trans-complementation probably enables high virus replication in vivo."

Iron deficiency and its associated anemia may contribute to reduced energetic efficiency, lower aerobic capacity, decreased endurance, and fatigue. In practical terms, the functional limitations of iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia may affect the ability of women to participate in work, school, social, and family activities. Iron deficiency may contribute to the cycle of poverty in the inner city by limiting the ability of women to work, earn money, and afford iron-rich sources of food. Although iron supplementation may prevent or treat iron deficiency, the use of iron supplements needs to be approached with caution in women with HIV and HCV infections."
4038,0.002,2.0,"Pegylated-IFN and ribavirin remains the current treatment for chronic HCV infection in patients co-infected with HIV-1, but this regimen has low efficacy rates, particularly for HCV genotype 1/4 infection, has severe side effects and is extremely costly. Therefore, accurate prediction of treatment response is urgently required. We have recently shown that the NK cell gene, KIR2DS3 and a SNP associated with the IL28B gene synergise to increase the risk of chronic infection in primary HCV mono-infected patients. Identification of SNPs associated with the IL28B gene has also proven very powerful for predicting patient response to treatment. Patients co-infected with HIV-1 are of particular concern given they respond less well to HCV treatment, have more side effects and suffer a more rapid liver disease progression. In this study, we examined both IL28B and KIR2DS3 for their ability to predict treatment response in a cohort of HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients attending two treatment centres in Europe. We found that variation in both host genetic risk factors, IL28B and KIR2DS3, was strongly associated with sustained virological response (SVR) to treatment in our co-infected cohort (n = 149). The majority of patients who achieved a rapid virological response (RVR) achieved a SVR. However, it is currently impossible to predict treatment outcome in patients who fail to achieve an RVR. In our cohort, the presence of host genetic risk factors, IL28B-T and KIR2DS3 alleles, resulted in increased odds of treatment failure in these RVR negative patients (n = 88). Our data suggests that testing for host genetic factors will improve predicting treatment responsiveness in the clinical management of co-infected patients, and provides further evidence of the importance of the innate immune system in the immune response to HCV.

5246,0.002,2.0,"The absolute number of CD4+ lymphocytes in blood is prognostic for disease progression, yet the cell surface density of CD4 receptors or chemokine receptors on a single cell has not previously been found to be predictive of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectivity outcome. It has recently been shown that human leukocyte elastase (HLE) and its ligand alpha(1) proteinase inhibitor (alpha(1)PI; alpha(1)antitrypsin) act as HIV fusion cofactors. The present study shows that decreased HIV infectivity is significantly correlated with decreased cell surface density of HLE but not with decreased CD4 nor chemokine receptors. In vitro HIV infectivity outcome in this study was predicted by the surface density of HLE on mononuclear phagocytes but not on lymphocytes. The set point HLE surface density was in part determined by alpha(1)PI. Decreased circulating alpha(1)PI was correlated with increased cell surface HLE and with increased HIV infectivity. The correlation of HIV infectivity outcome with surface HLE and circulating alpha(1)PI supports the utility of these HIV cofactors in diagnostic analysis and therapeutic intervention."

A cohort of 141 homosexual or bisexual men were assessed semiannually for CD4 count, HIV RNA viral load, medical and depressive symptoms, and a neuropsychological test battery, including psychomotor speed, verbal memory, and executive function. In a mixed-effects model, increasingly potent antiretroviral therapy was associated with improvement in tests of psychomotor processing speed. This study contributes to the growing literature documenting the longitudinal benefit provided by potent antiretroviral therapy for neuropsychological function, particularly psychomotor processing speed, in patients with HIV illness."

2665,0.002,2.0,"Jet injectors may transmit blood-borne infections, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To evaluate the safety of an anticontaminant disposable device which protects the jet injector apparatus, 22,714 healthy subjects were intradermally inoculated (38,162 inoculations) with a variety of vaccines. All the subjects were systematically followed-up clinically and epidemiologically for 6-18 months after inoculation; blood samples from 1619 subjects, before and 60-75 days after inoculation, were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV. Before vaccination 212 (13.09%) subjects were positive: 204 positive for HBV markers and eight for the HCV marker. None of the subjects were positive for the anti-HIV marker. During the clinico-epidemiological surveillance and the laboratory investigations mentioned above no clinical viral hepatitis B or C case and no seroconversion to positivity for HBV or HCV markers among the susceptible persons in the group were reported. Considering that in similar situations there is a theoretical risk of transmission as high as 1 per 388 to 1 per 3367 injections and that in our case 38,162 inoculations were performed in 22,714 subjects with the same Dermojet protected by the same type of anticontaminant disposable device, no contamination risk being reported, the conclusion can be reached that jet injectors can be safely used in the medical practice if they are protected by the sterile anticontaminant disposable device."
6132,0.002,2.0,"As lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for pregnant women is implemented, it is important to understand the attitudes and norms affecting women's postpartum ART adherence. This is a qualitative cross-sectional study of HIV-positive postpartum women (n = 112) enrolled in a 2-year observational prospective cohort in Rwanda. Informed by the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), we conducted in-depth interviews with women whose children were 0-6, 7-12, 13-18, or 21-24 months of age to describe factors contributing to adherence and changes over time. Positive ART attitudes reported by women included mothers' health promotion, prevention of infant HIV infection, higher CD4 count, and improved physical appearance. Negative attitudes were few, but included side effects and the lifelong nature of treatment. Learning from people living with HIV (PLHIV) was identified as a norm facilitating adherence; ART adherence was inhibited by fear of disclosure or stigmatization in communities and clinics. Poor adherence behaviors were common immediately after HIV diagnosis, not necessarily during prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). Women with older children, most of whom stopped breastfeeding by 13-18 months, reported more barriers and missed doses than women with younger children. The TRA was useful in identifying the collective influence of attitudes, norms, and intentions on behavior. Findings suggest that HIV-positive women are vulnerable to poor adherence following HIV diagnosis and around the time of breastfeeding cessation. Lifelong treatment adherence can be supported through PLHIV exemplifying long-term ART use, fewer and less stigmatizing clinic visits, and counseling messages highlighting the benefits of drugs on appearance and illness prevention and incorporating biological feedback."
8174,0.002,2.0,"It has been suggested that the dimer initiation site/dimer linkage sequence (DIS/DLS) region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA genome plays an important role at various stages of the viral life cycle. Recently we found that the duplication of the DIS/DLS region on viral RNA caused the production of partially monomeric RNAs in virions, indicating that this region indeed mediates RNA-RNA interaction. In this report, we followed up on this finding to identify the necessary and sufficient region for RNA dimerization in the virion of HIV-1. The region thus identified was 144 bases in length, extending from the junction of R/U5 and U5/L stem-loops to the end of SL4. The trans-acting responsive element, polyadenylation signal, primer binding site, upper stem-loop of U5/L, and SL2 were not needed for the function of this region. The insertion of this region into the ectopic location of the viral genome did not affect the level of virion production by transfection. However, the resultant virions contained monomerized genomes and showed drastic reductions in infectivity. A reduction was observed especially in the reverse transcription process. An attempt to generate a replication-competent virus with monomerized genome was performed by the long-term culture of mutant virus-infected cells. All recovered viruses were wild-type revertants, indicating a fatal defect of the mutation. These results suggest that genome dimerization or DIS/DLS itself also plays an important role in the early stages of virus infection."
9517,0.002,2.0,"To determine whether Korean red ginseng (KRG) has beneficial effects on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients administered highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we analyzed the CD4 T-cell count, viral load, and resistance mutations to HAART in 46 individuals. Thirteen patients harbored resistance mutations at baseline. The study population was divided into two groups: specifically, a group treated with a combination of HAART plus KRG (23 patients) and a group treated with HAART alone (23 patients). The annual increase in CD4 T-cell count in the combination group was significantly higher than that in the group treated with HAART alone (P < 0.05). Overall, 21 patients harbored resistance mutations after 3 years of therapy. Following exclusion of 13 patients displaying baseline resistance mutations, 7.1% of patients (1/14) in the combination group and 42.1% (8/19) in the HAART group were identified with resistance mutations. One patient with baseline resistance mutations in the combination group did not display resistance mutations 3 years after HAART therapy. High-level resistance mutations were significantly lower in the combination group than in the group treated with HAART alone. Five patients showed no improvement in viral copy number (26.3% [5/19]) in the combination group and 9 (45.0% [9/20]) showed no improvement in the HAART-only group. Our data support the clinical utility of KRG intake during HAART therapy."
9575,0.002,2.0,"Recurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. Recently, antiviral therapy, such as lamivudine, has become available for prophylaxis against HBV reactivation posttransplantation and for the treatment of HBV recurrent disease. We report our initial experience with lamivudine therapy in patients with precore mutant-associated HBV infection undergoing liver transplantation (n = 29). Outcomes were compared in three patient groups: group 1, precore mutant HBV infection not receiving lamivudine (n = 10); group 2, recurrent precore mutant HBV infection posttransplantation subsequently treated with lamivudine (n = 10); and group 3, HBV precore mutant patients undergoing liver transplantation and receiving lamivudine and low-dose hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) from the time of transplantation (n = 9). In group 1, HBV recurred in 9 of 10 patients, with subsequent graft loss in all 9 patients. In group 2, all patients developed HBV recurrence at a mean of 7.3 months posttransplantation and started lamivudine therapy at a median of 16 months posttransplantation. Follow-up on lamivudine therapy was for a median of 11 months. Six of these 10 patients developed mutations in the HBV polymerase gene associated with lamivudine resistance. There were two liver failure-related deaths in this group. In group 3 patients, there was one death from graft-versus-host disease. The remaining 8 patients have been followed up for a mean of 15.6 months posttransplantation, and all remain hepatitis B surface antigen negative and HBV DNA negative. In conclusion, lamivudine therapy in association with low-dose HBIG is effective in preventing HBV reactivation posttransplantation. Rescue therapy with lamivudine in patients with HBV recurrence is only moderately effective, with a 60% lamivudine resistance rate in patients treated for longer than 6 months."
5604,0.002,2.0,"Patients' deaths due to the organ donor shortage make it imperative that every suitable organ be transplanted. False-positive results of tests for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) result in lost organs. A survey of US organ procurement organizations collected the numbers of donors and ruled-out potential donors who had a positive result on an HIV test from January 1,2006, to October 31, 2008. Sixty-two percent of US organ procurement organizations participated. Of the 12397 donor/nondonor cases, 56 (0.45%) had an initial positive result on an HIV antibody or HIV nucleic acid test, and only 8 (14.3%) of those were confirmed positive. Of the false-positive results, 50% were from HIV antibody tests and 50% were from HIV nucleic acid tests. Organs are a scarce, finite, and perishable resource. Use of HIV antibody testing has produced a remarkably safe track record of avoiding HIV transmission, with 22 years of nonoccurrence between transmissions. Because false positives occur with any test, including the HIV Ab test, adding nucleic acid testing to the standard donor testing panel doubles the number of false-positive HIV test results and thus the number of medically suitable donors lost. The required HIV antibody test is 99.99% effective in preventing transmission of the HIV virus. Adding the HIV nucleic acid test to routine organ donor screening could result in as many as 761 to 1551 unnecessary deaths of patients between HIV transmission events because medically suitable organs are wasted."
5442,0.002,2.0,"To determine the effect of active tuberculosis on survival and the incidence of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients, we performed a retrospective cohort study at four U.S. medical centers to compare the survival and incidence rate of opportunistic infections in 106 HIV-infected patients with active tuberculosis (cases) with that of 106 HIV-infected patients without tuberculosis (control subjects) but with a similar level of immunosuppression (measured by the absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count) as the cases. Cases and control subjects were similar with regard to age, sex, race, previous opportunistic infection, and use of antiretroviral therapy, but they were more likely than control subjects to have a history of intravenous drug use (49 versus 19%). The mean CD4+ counts were similar for cases and control subjects (154 versus 153 cells/microliters, respectively). The incidence rate of new AIDS-defining opportunistic infections in cases was 4.0 infections per 100 person-months compared with 2.8 infections per 100 person-months in control subjects for an incidence rate ratio (RR) of 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 0.94-2.11). Cases also had a shorter overall survival than did controls subjects (p = 0.001). Active tuberculosis was associated with an increased risk for death (odds ratio = 2.17), even when controlling for age, intravenous drug use, previous opportunistic infection, baseline CD4+ count, and antiretroviral therapy. Although active tuberculosis may be an independent marker of advanced immunosuppression in HIV-infected patients, it may also act as a cofactor to accelerate the clinical course of HIV infection."

2635,0.002,2.0,"Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) defining diseases and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is thought to relate with increased acute toxicity of chemoradiotherapy (CRT).We investigated the effect of HIV status in the incidence of neutropenia associated with cisplatin-based CRT for CC and its impact in treatment completion.This is a single-center retrospective cohort study. Data collection was performed for all the consecutive stage Ib-IV CC women treated with cisplatin-based CRT from 2012 to 2016, and with known HIV status.Sixty-one patients were included, 6 were HIV+. HIV+ patients had a higher risk of neutropenia at any cycle during cisplatin CRT [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 7.3, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.02-52.3; P = .05]. Despite the absolute differences, mean neutrophil count was nonsignificantly lower in HIV+ women, both at baseline [4455/μL (interquartile range, IQR: 1830-6689) vs 6340 (IQR: 1720-18,970) for HIV-, P = .98] and at the end of treatment [1752/μL (IQR: 1100-2930) vs 3147/μL (IQR: 920-18,390) in HIV-; P = .06]. Moreover, when considering the effect of time, CRT seems to induce a consistent drop of neutrophils in both groups (P = .229). No febrile neutropenia events occurred.In HIV+ women, there were more CT cycle delays (P = .013), patients were more prone to use granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; HIV+ 40.0% vs HIV- 4.0%; P = .04) and less likely to complete at least 5 cycles of cisplatin (P = .02). All patients received adequate dose of pelvic RT, regardless of HIV status.HIV+ patients have a significantly increased risk of neutropenia during CRT treatment for CC and are less likely to complete chemotherapy with cisplatin."

3639,0.002,2.0,"Abstract Our objective was to evaluate the liver toxicity of antiretroviral regimens including fosamprenavir plus ritonavir (FPV/r) 1400/100 mg once daily (QD) in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients. This was a prospective cohort study that included 117 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who started FPV/r 1400/100 mg QD-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who neither had received a previous antiretroviral regimen containing FPV nor had a past history of virologic failure while receiving protease inhibitors (PI). The primary end point of the study was the occurrence of grade 3-4 liver enzymes elevations (LEE) within 1 year after starting FPV/r QD. Factors potentially associated with grade 3-4 LEE, including baseline liver fibrosis, were analyzed. Eleven (9%) patients had a grade 3-4 LEE during the follow-up, resulting in an incidence of severe liver toxicity of 9% (95% confidence interval 4.1-14.6%). None of these cases led to FPV/r discontinuation. Baseline liver fibrosis could be assessed in 97 (83%) patients. Six of 71 patients (8%) with significant fibrosis had a grade 3-4 LEE versus 2 of 26 (8%) without significant fibrosis (p=1.0). Twenty (21%) patients had cirrhosis at baseline. There were no cases of LEE among cirrhotics. In conclusion, the incidence of severe liver toxicity after 1 year of therapy with FPV/r QD-based ART in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is similar to what has been reported with other boosted PIs. In addition, the presence of significant fibrosis or cirrhosis was not associated with the emergence of liver toxicity. Thus, ART regimens containing FPV/r QD may be considered safe in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, including those with cirrhosis."
4135,0.002,2.0,"Liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinomas are major health problems of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. To date, rare model has reproduced liver fibrosis associated with long-term HBV infection which in turn has hindered both the understanding of HBV biology and the development of new treatment options. Here, using adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) mediated delivery of a 1.2-kb HBV genome, we successfully generated a chronic HBV infectious mouse model that presents the associated liver fibrosis observed following human infection. After AAV8/HBV1.2 vector administration, mice demonstrated effective HBV replication and transcription which resulted in HBV antigen expression and viremia over 6 months. Although no obvious acute inflammatory response was noted, these mice still developed chronic liver disease and hepatic fibrogenesis as demonstrated by increased ground glass-like hepatocytes, an increasing trend of collagen deposition and upregulated fibrosis markers, including type I collagen, type III collagen, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP), and transforming growth factor-β1(TGF-β1). Taken together, AAV-mediated HBV gene delivery to the mouse liver, induced HBV persistent infection accompanied by liver fibrosis which can serve as a model for investigating the precise mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis following chronic HBV infection as well as for the potential development of novel therapeutics.

4015,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant worldwide health care problem. Nearly one-third of all patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are coinfected with HCV. Compared with HIV-monoinfected persons, coinfected individuals experience more rapid progression of fibrosis and higher incidence of cirrhosis and death as a result of liver disease. Treatment for HCV infection includes ribavirin (RBV) plus interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) or pegylated IFN, a combination treatment associated with anemia that may require RBV dose reduction or discontinuation. IFN-RBV-associated anemia is more profound among coinfected patients, who have a high prevalence of pretreatment anemia and may also be taking other medications causing anemia. Epoetin alfa administration to HCV-infected patients with IFN-RBV-related anemia can significantly increase hemoglobin levels and maintain significantly higher RBV doses compared with patients treated with RBV dose reduction alone. Higher RBV doses and adherence to HCV therapy have been associated with higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates. Maintenance of RBV dose with epoetin alfa may improve adherence, thereby affecting SVR."

3598,0.002,2.0,"To investigate whether low CD4+ T-cell counts in healthy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected Ethiopians influence tuberculosis (TB) immunological memory, tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion and reactivity rates were investigated among adults with and without HIV infection in urban settings in Ethiopia. Reaction to the TST was analyzed with purified protein derivative by the Mantoux technique. A total of 1,286 individuals with TST results of > or = 5-mm (n = 851) and < or = 4-mm (n = 435) induration diameters were included. Individuals with < or = 4-mm induration sizes were followed up for 21.4 +/- 9.5 months (mean +/- standard deviation) to observe skin test conversion. The overall TST reactivity (> or = 5-mm induration diameter) was 66.2% (n = 851). Reactivity was significantly lower among HIV-positive persons (40.5%) than among HIV-negative persons (68.7%) (P < 0.001). Of the above persons, 32 incident TB patients were checked for their TST status 13.05 +/- 11.1 months before diagnosis and reactivity was found among 22 (68.7%) of them. Of the TST-negative persons with 0- to 4-mm indurations who were followed up for 3 years, the conversion rate to positivity was 17.9/100 person-years of observation (PYO) (14.4/100 PYO and 18.3/100 PYO in HIV-positive and -negative persons, respectively). Despite lower absolute CD4+ T-cell numbers in Ethiopians, higher TST conversion and reactivity rates show the presence of a higher rate of latent TB infection and/or transmission. The lower TST positivity rate before a diagnosis of TB disease showed the lower sensitivity of the test. This indicates the need for other sensitive and specific diagnostic and screening methods to detect TB infection, particularly among HIV-positive persons, so that they can be given prophylactic isoniazid therapy."
1583,0.002,2.0,"Neuronal damage in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the brain is thought to occur at least in part through NMDA receptor (NMDAR) excitation initiated by soluble neurotoxins from HIV-infected brain macrophages. Furthermore, brain regions enriched in NMDAR-2A (NR2A) and NMDAR-2B (NR2B) subunits, such as the hippocampus, are particularly vulnerable. Using cultured rat hippocampal cells and HIV-1-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (HIV/MDM), we examined the role of NR2A and NR2B in HIV/MDM-induced hippocampal neuronal death. We used the primary HIV-1 strain Jago derived from the CSF of an individual with HIV-associated dementia and that robustly replicates in MDM. We found the following: (1) hippocampal neuronal susceptibility to HIV/MDM excitotoxins varies according to the developmental expression patterns of NR2A and NR2B; (2) NMDAR activation by HIV/MDM results in neuronal calpain activation, which results in neuronal death; and (3) selective antagonists of homomeric NR2B/NR2B- and heteromeric NR2A/NR2B-containing NMDARs, as well as an inhibitor of calpain activity, afford neuroprotection against HIV/MDM. These studies establish a clear link between macrophage HIV infection, neuronal NR2A and NR2B activation, and calpain-mediated hippocampal neuronal death. They further suggest a dominant role for NR2A and NR2B in determining neuronal susceptibility in HIV-infected brain. Antagonists of NR2A and NR2B subunits as well as inhibitors of calpain activation offer attractive neuroprotective approaches against HIV in both developing and mature brain."

The main limitation in the use of lamivudine is resistant mutation selection. Most of these mutations affect the YMDD motif of the HBV DNA polymerase. The resistance occurs through M550V or M550I aminoacid replacements. The M550V variation may be accompanied by L526M mutation, notably in HIV-HBV co-infected patients. The aim of this study was to investigate mutations associated with lamivudine resistance in a hemodialysis patient chronically co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, who was submitted to several antiretroviral treatments."

Overweight was defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m; <30 kg/m, obesity was ≥30 kg/m. Patients' characteristics contemporary to BMI assessment were collected. Multivariate logistic regression identified risk factors associated with overweight/obesity.Eight hundred sixty-two patients, median age 51 years, 21.5 years of HIV infection follow-up, 585 (68%) male, 829 (96%) receiving combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) for median 16.7 years, 768 (91%) HIV load <40 copies/mL, 618 (73%) CD4 ≥500 cells/mm; 266 (31%) HCV serology, 110 (13%) had detectable HCV-RNA. Overweight affected 191 (22%) patients and obesity 46 (5%). Overweight and obesity were associated with age, HIV follow-up duration, and HIV transmission risk group. Overweight was also associated with gender and HCV status. In patients with substance use data, overweight was associated with alcohol and nonsmoking status. Obesity was associated with nonsmoking and ex-smoker status. Overweight/obesity were not found associated with cART or immune cell counts.In HIV-infected people, aging, alcohol consumption, nonsmoking, and ex-smoker status, the absence of HCV coinfection and to have cleared HCV infection are associated with overweight and/or obesity. Clinicians should be aware of these trends and consider introducing weight management programs as part of routine HIV care."
7890,0.002,2.0,"Certain human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates are able to productively infect nondividing cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. We have used a molecular genetic approach to construct two different HIV-1 integrase mutants that were studied in the context of an infectious, macrophage-tropic HIV-1 molecular clone. One mutant, HIV-1 delta D(35)E, containing a 37-residue deletion within the central, catalytic domain of integrase, was noninfectious in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived macrophages. The HIV-1 delta D(35)E mutant, however, exhibited defects in the assembly and/or release of progeny virions in transient transfection assays, as well as defects in entry and/or viral DNA synthesis during the early stages of monocyte-derived macrophage infection. The second mutant, HIV-1D116N/8, containing a single Asp-to-Asn substitution at the invariant Asp-116 residue of integrase, was also noninfectious in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived macrophages but, in contrast to HIV-1 delta D(35)E, was indistinguishable from wild-type virus in reverse transcriptase production. PCR analysis indicated that HIV-1D116N/8 entered monocyte-derived macrophages efficiently and reverse transcribed its RNA but was unable to complete its replication cycle because of a presumed block to integration. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that integration is an obligate step in productive HIV-1 infection of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and primary human macrophage cultures."
237,0.002,2.0,"Here, we found that a 6-mer peptide, Poly6, derived from the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which overlaps with a polymerase corresponding to a preS1 deletion reported to contribute to liver disease progression, can elicit an antiviral effect against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 by inhibiting HIV-1 integrase (IN) activity of infected cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that the anti-HIV-1 effects of Poly6 occurred via the inhibition of integration, which resulted from the inhibition of acetylation of HIV-1 IN possibly by downregulation of p300 histone acetyltransferase. Our data suggest the potential therapeutic use of a 6-mer HBV-derived peptide, Poly6, as an anti-HIV-1 agent to suppress HIV-1 infection via inhibiting integrase activity."

Bone mineral density (BMD) and microarchitecture were characterized in 38 HIV-infected men on antiretroviral therapy (18 perinatally-infected, 20 adolescence-infected) and 20 uninfected men age 20 to 25 years by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT). Flow cytometry was utilized to measure CD4+/CD8+ activation (HLADR+CD38+) and senescence (CD28-CD57+) and to quantify circulating osteogenic precursor (COP) cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using antibodies to RUNX2 and osteocalcin (OCN). Telomere lengths were measured in sorted COP cells using qPCR. DXA-derived areal BMD Z-scores and HRpQCT-derived volumetric BMD (vBMD) measures were lower in HIV-infected than uninfected men. Proportion of activated and senescent CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were higher in HIV-infected than uninfected men. The percentage of COP cells (mean ± SE) was lower in HIV-infected than uninfected (0.19% ± 0.02% versus 0.43% ± 0.06%; p < 0.0001) men, and also lower in perinatally-infected than adolescence-infected men (0.15% ± 0.02% versus 0.22% ± 0.03%; p < 0.04). A higher proportion of COP cells correlated with higher bone stiffness, a measure of bone strength, whereas a higher proportion of activated CD4+ T cells correlated with lower BMD and stiffness and lower proportion of COP cells. T cell activation with HIV-infection was associated with decreased numbers of osteogenic precursors as well as lower peak bone mass and bone strength. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research."
2535,0.002,2.0,"Human papillomavirus is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases worldwide. The natural history of oral HPV infection is unclear, and its risk factors have not been explored. Immunocompromised individuals, as exemplified by HIV patients, are at high risk for HPV-related diseases. The mean of this study is to determine the prevalence of HPV in the oral tract of HIV-1-positive male subjects and its association with risk factors. A total of 283 oral wash samples from HIV-1-positive men were tested. The oral fluid samples were used for DNA extraction and conventional PCR amplification; HPV genotyping was performed by hybridization. HPV genotyping revealed that nine samples (3.5%) were positive for HPV DNA; the major high-risk HPV types identified were 51 and 66. Worldwide studies have shown a variable prevalence of oral HPV. The diversity of genotypes and the high prevalence of multiple infections in HIV-infected subjects can be better explained by the effects of HIV-induced immunosuppression. The most important risk factors are unprotected sexual intercourse, but other factors for this infection have been described elsewhere including smoking, age and HIV-positive serostatus. In this study, smoking was the most important risk factor for acquiring oral HPV in HIV-1-infected subjects in Brazil."

HIV-1 gag, pol and nef sequences were generated from a historical repository of longitudinal specimens from 19 vertically infected infants. Evolutionary rate and selection were estimated for each gene and in CTL-restricted and non-restricted epitopes. Evolutionary rate was higher in nef and gag vs. pol, and lower in infants with non-severe immunosuppression vs. severe immunosuppression across gag and nef. Selection pressure was stronger in infants with non-severe immunosuppression vs. severe immunosuppression across gag. The analysis also showed that infants with non-severe immunosuppression had stronger selection in CTL-restricted vs. non-restricted epitopes in gag and nef. Evidence of stronger CTL selection was absent in infants with severe immunosuppression. These data indicate that infant CTLs can exert selection pressure on gag and nef epitopes in early infection and that stronger selection across CTL epitopes is associated with favourable clinical outcomes. These results have implications for the development of paediatric HIV-1 vaccines."
2771,0.002,2.0,"Because vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from mother to infant occurs in only 15%-35% of possible opportunities, natural immune defenses of the mother, fetus, or neonate may be protective against infection. The relation between antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) antibodies and HIV-1 infection was explored in 78 neonates born to HIV-infected women. More than 90% of sera had measurable ADCC titers against HIV-1IIIB. Infant titers were closely correlated with maternal titers but were independent of total IgG and total antibody reactive to the same strain in whole virus ELISA. At birth, mean ADCC antibody levels of infants or their mothers were the same for infants who were infected and those who ultimately seroreverted and remained healthy. ADCC antibody titers against HIV-1SF2 were weakly correlated with anti-HIV-1IIIB titers and did not predict protection from HIV-1 infection. High levels of anti-HIV-1 ADCC antibody at birth are not protective against vertical transmission of HIV-1."
3850,0.002,2.0,"The nature and intensity of AIDS stigma are shaped by the social construction of the epidemic in different locales. Stigma therefore needs to be discussed in its cultural context. This clinic-based study aims at understanding stigma among 203 HIV positive individuals from Chennai, South India. The study throws light on the impact of stigma on the quality of life among these individuals. It also discusses the gender implications of stigma. This study brings out the findings that actual stigma experienced among those infected with HIV is much less (26%) as compared to the fear of being stigmatized or perceived stigma (97%). Internalizing of stigma was found to have a highly significant negative correlation with quality of life in the psychological domain and a significant negative correlation in the environmental domain. However individuals who did experience actual stigma seemed more determined to live and experience an above moderate quality of life. The implication of this study encourages HIV infected individuals to rise above stigma, avoid internalizing their stigmatized feelings and work toward a better quality of life. Health providers need to address these issues in their care for HIV infected individuals."
6977,0.002,2.0,"Palliative care for patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) includes components of pain and symptom management, advance care planning, prioritization of life goals, and the support of individuals and families throughout the entire continuum of the disease. There are numerous social stressors such as stigma, infected family members and caregivers, loss of housing and independent living, and the increasing influence of substance use in all communities. Because many barriers prevent those with advanced disease from getting comprehensive pain and symptom management as well as option planning, it is important for all HIV care providers to improve their knowledge, sensitivity, and competence regarding this aspect of care. This article provides an overview of critical issues in palliative care and information on how best to improve HIV primary care."
5923,0.002,2.0,"The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy and remarkable success in the treatment of paediatric HIV infection has changed the face of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic in children from a fatal disease to that of a chronic illness. Many children living with HIV are surviving into adolescence. This sub-population of people living with HIV is emerging as a public health challenge and burden in terms of healthcare management and service utilization than previously anticipated. This article provides an overview of the socio-developmental challenges facing adolescents living with HIV especially in a resource-limited setting like Nigeria. These include concerns about their healthy sexuality, safer sex and transition to adulthood, disclosure of their status and potential stigma, challenges faced with daily living, access and adherence to treatment, access to care and support, and clinic transition. Other issues include reality of death and implications for fertility intentions, mental health concerns and neurocognitive development. Coping strategies and needed support for adolescents living with HIV are also discussed, and the implications for policy formulation and programme design and implementation in Nigeria are highlighted."
5572,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection disrupts the intestinal immune system, leading to microbial translocation and systemic immune activation. We investigated the impact of HIV-1 infection on the intestinal microbiome and its association with mucosal T-cell and dendritic cell (DC) frequency and activation, as well as with levels of systemic T-cell activation, inflammation, and microbial translocation. Bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing was performed on colon biopsies and fecal samples from subjects with chronic, untreated HIV-1 infection and uninfected control subjects. Colon biopsies of HIV-1-infected subjects had increased abundances of Proteobacteria and decreased abundances of Firmicutes compared with uninfected donors. Furthermore at the genus level, a significant increase in Prevotella and decrease in Bacteroides was observed in HIV-1-infected subjects, indicating a disruption in the Bacteroidetes bacterial community structure. This HIV-1-associated increase in Prevotella abundance was associated with increased numbers of activated colonic T cells and myeloid DCs. Principal coordinates analysis demonstrated an HIV-1-related change in the microbiome that was associated with increased mucosal cellular immune activation, microbial translocation, and blood T-cell activation. These observations suggest that an important relationship exists between altered mucosal bacterial communities and intestinal inflammation during chronic HIV-1 infection. "
6383,0.002,2.0,"A pilot study was carried out in a group of six HIV-infected non-adherent men testing the effects of a behavioural medication management intervention on adherence with antiretroviral drugs. The study was prospective, using a one-group repeated-measures design. Adherence was measured using two self-reports. The intervention was a behaviourally-based programme that lasted for three months and included individualized education about antiretroviral medication and their side effects; positive reinforcement and encouragement; individualized counselling weekly; follow-up calls; and lifestyle assessment and the identification of adherence barriers. Assessments were carried out at recruitment, immediately after the initiation of the intervention, one month, three months and six months later. Results suggested that the intervention enhanced adherence rates from a mean percentage of 80.27 at baseline to a mean of 97.5% at the end of follow-up (six months time point). Similar improvement was observed in the scores of the scale measuring adherence difficulties. Further, CD4+ counts also slightly improved. Interviews with four of the participants at the end of the study highlighted the problems experienced by patients in taking their medication and supported the usefulness of the intervention. Because of the complexity of the factors behind adherence, it is important that patients are supported with individualized medication management programmes."
4416,0.002,2.0,"In HIV-1 infection, plasma viral load (VL) has dual implications for pathogenesis and public health. Based on well-known patterns of HIV-1 evolution and immune escape, we hypothesized that VL is an evolving quantitative trait that depends heavily on duration of infection (DOI), demographic features, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes and viral characteristics. Prospective data from 421 African seroconverters with at least four eligible visits did show relatively steady VL beyond 3 months of untreated infection, but host and viral factors independently associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal VL often varied by analytical approaches and sliding time windows. Specifically, the effects of age, HLA-B(⁎)53 and infecting HIV-1 subtypes (A1, C and others) on VL were either sporadic or highly sensitive to time windows. These observations were strengthened by the addition of 111 seroconverters with 2-3 eligible VL results, suggesting that DOI should be a critical parameter in epidemiological and clinical studies. "

Drugs with a low level of potential toxicity, especially those that are not nucleoside analogues, should be evaluated in healthy individuals who are not infected with HIV before trials in HIV-infected patients commence. The guideline also discusses possible clinical and laboratory end points for efficacy and emphasizes the need for careful validation of all laboratory end points used. The approach of the guideline is deliberately general: more specific recommendations would soon become outdated in this field, which is characterized by extremely rapid developments."
5110,0.002,2.0,"Liver-related mortality is increased in the setting of HIV-hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection. However, interactions between HIV and HBV to explain this observation have not been described. We hypothesized that HIV infection of hepatocytes directly affects the life cycle of HBV. We infected human hepatic cell lines expressing HBV (Hep3B and AD38 cells) or not expressing HBV (Huh7, HepG2, and AD43 cells) with laboratory strains of HIV (NL4-3 and AD8), as well as a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-pseudotyped HIV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Following HIV infection with NL4-3 or AD8 in hepatic cell lines, we observed a significant increase in HIV reverse transcriptase activity which was infectious. Despite no detection of surface CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 by flow cytometry, AD8 infection of AD38 cells was inhibited by maraviroc and NL4-3 was inhibited by AMD3100, demonstrating that HIV enters AD38 hepatic cell lines via CCR5 or CXCR4. High-level infection of AD38 cells (50%) was achieved using VSV-pseudotyped HIV. Coinfection of the AD38 cell line with HIV did not alter the HBV DNA amount or species as determined by Southern blotting or nucleic acid signal amplification. However, coinfection with HIV was associated with a significant increase in intracellular HBsAg when measured by Western blotting, quantitative HBsAg, and fluorescence microscopy. We conclude that HIV infection of HBV-infected hepatic cell lines significantly increased intracellular HBsAg but not HBV DNA synthesis and that increased intrahepatic HBsAg secondary to direct infection by HIV may contribute to accelerated liver disease in HIV-HBV-coinfected individuals."
1159,0.002,2.0,"Rapid detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can result in improved patient care and/or faster implementation of public health preventive measures. A new rapid test, Determine (Abbott, Abbott Park, Ill.), detects HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 antibodies within 15 min by using 50 microl of serum or plasma. No specialized equipment or ancillary supplies are required, and results are read visually. A positive result is noted by the appearance of a red line. An operational control (red line) indicates proper test performance. We evaluated the Determine rapid HIV detection test with a group of well-characterized serum samples (CD4 counts and viral loads were known) and serum samples from HIV-positive individuals at field sites in Honduras and the Dominican Republic. In the field evaluations, the results obtained by the Determine assay were compared to those obtained by local in-country HIV screening procedures. We evaluated serum from 100 HIV-positive patients and 66 HIV-negative patients. All samples gave the expected results. In a companion study, 42 HIV-positive samples from a Miami, Fla., serum bank were tested by the Determine assay. The samples had been characterized in terms of CD4 counts and viral loads. Fifteen patients had CD4 counts <200 cells/mm(3), while 27 patients had CD4 counts >200 cells/mm(3). Viral loads ranged from 630 to 873,746 log(10) copies/ml. All samples from the Miami serum bank were positive by the Determine test. Combined results from the multicenter studies indicated that the correct results were obtained by the Determine assay for 100% (142 of 142) of the HIV-positive serum samples and 100% (66 of 66) of the HIV-negative serum samples. The Determine test was simple to perform and the results were easy to interpret. The Determine test provides a valuable new method for the rapid identification of HIV-positive individuals, especially in developing countries with limited laboratory infrastructures."
231,0.002,2.0,"Hepatologists are frequently asked to evaluate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with abnormal liver enzymes and to assess the causal role of medications, such as antiretroviral drugs. Recently, the use of HIV-1 specific non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV), has been associated with severe hepatic injury. We prospectively studied the incidence of severe hepatotoxicity (grade 3 or 4 change in alanine or aspartate transaminase levels) among 568 patients receiving NNRTI-containing antiretroviral therapy, including 312 and 256 patients prescribed EFV and NVP, respectively. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) were detected in 43% and 7.7% of patients, respectively. Severe hepatotoxicity was observed in 15.6% of patients prescribed NVP and 8.0% of those prescribed EFV, but only 32% of NVP and 50% of EFV-associated episodes were detected during the first 12-weeks of therapy. The risk was significantly greater among persons with chronic viral hepatitis (69% of cases) and those prescribed concurrent protease inhibitors (PIs) (82% of cases). Nonetheless, 84% of patients with chronic HCV or HBV did not experience severe hepatotoxicity. Severe hepatotoxicity occurs throughout the course of NNRTI therapy and is more common among patients prescribed nevirapine, those coinfected with HCV or HBV, and those coadministered protease inhibitors."
7288,0.002,2.0,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) can increase numbers of absolute CD4 cells in persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus who are receiving antiretroviral therapy. Twenty-five subjects with > 400/mm3 absolute CD4 cells received zidovudine and low-dose intravenous or subcutaneous IL-2 (< or = 10(6) U/m2). Absolute CD4 cells increased significantly during IL-2 treatment, and 56% of the subjects achieved a maximal increase of > or = 500 cells/mm3. A dose-response relationship favored increasing IL-2 doses, and subcutaneous delivery offered greater increases than intravenous administration. Fifteen subjects had persistent increases of > or = 100 cells/mm3 6 weeks after IL-2 was discontinued. No changes occurred in delayed-type hypersensitivity or helper T cell responses to recall antigens. Cell-mediated cytotoxicities increased against Daudi cells. IL-2 was well tolerated and only 1 subject required dose reduction. Relatively low-dose IL-2 delivered by subcutaneous or intravenous routes may provide an important complement to antiretroviral therapy to increase absolute CD4 cells with the potential for less toxicity than with higher IL-2 doses."
8356,0.002,2.0,"Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have an increased cardiovascular risk. Although initially this increased risk was attributed to metabolic alterations associated with antiretroviral treatment, in recent years, the attention has been focused on the HIV disease itself. Inflammation, immune system activation, and endothelial dysfunction facilitated by HIV infection have been identified as key factors in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. In this review, we describe the epidemiology and pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in patients with HIV infection and summarize the latest knowledge on the relationship between traditional and novel inflammatory, immune activation, and endothelial dysfunction biomarkers on the cardiovascular risk associated with HIV infection.

3092,0.002,2.0,"Statin use decreases the risk of decompensation and mortality in patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV). Whether this beneficial effect can be extended to cirrhosis in the general population or cirrhosis due to other causes, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or alcohol, remains unknown. Statin use also decreases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection. It is unclear whether the effect can be observed in patients with pre-existing cirrhosis. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of statin use on rates of decompensation, mortality, and HCC in HBV-, HCV-, and alcohol-related cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis were identified from a representative cohort of Taiwan National Health Insurance beneficiaries from 2000 to 2013. Statin users, defined as having a cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) ≥28, were selected and served as the case cohort. Statin nonusers (<28 cDDD) were matched through propensity scores. The association between statin use and risk of decompensation, mortality, and HCC were estimated. A total of 1350 patients with cirrhosis were enrolled. Among patients with cirrhosis, statin use decreased the risk of decompensation, mortality, and HCC in a dose-dependent manner (P for trend <0.0001, <0.0001, and 0.009, respectively). Regression analysis revealed a lower risk of decompensation among statin users with cirrhosis due to chronic HBV (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.62) or HCV infection (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29-0.93). The lowered risk of decompensation was of borderline significance among statin users with alcohol-related cirrhosis (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.45-1.07)."
4300,0.002,2.0,"Our search of the literature revealed no detailed case reports about drug fever induced by piperacillin/tazobactam in a patient with HIV infection although there were a few case reports about drug fever due to piperacillin/tazobactam with other comorbidities. A 63-year-old male patient with HIV positive was admitted for acute cholecystitis. He was started on piperacillin/tazobactam. For the next 8 days, he had intermittent fever up to 103°F (39.4°C) with relative bradycardia although he showed clinical improvement. There was no laboratory or imaging findings suggestive of another infectious source and drug fever was suspected. The antibiotics were stopped and after 48 hours no fever was observed until the day of discharge. Piperacillin/tazobactam can induce fever in patients with cystic fibrosis and in patients with other conditions. Drug fever may be more prevalent in patients with HIV infection. It has no characteristic pattern and may not be associated with eosinophilia. "
4964,0.002,2.0,"The Tat-responsive region (TAR) element is a critical RNA regulatory element in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat, which is required for activation of gene expression by the transactivator protein Tat. Recently, we demonstrated by gel-retardation analysis that RNA polymerase II binds to TAR RNA and that Tat prevents this binding even when Tat does not bind to TAR RNA. These results suggested that direct interactions between Tat and RNA polymerase II may prevent RNA polymerase II pausing and lead to Tat-mediated increases in transcriptional elongation. To test this possibility, we performed protein interaction studies with RNA polymerase II and both the HIV-1 and the closely related HIV-2 Tat protein. These studies indicated that both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat proteins could specifically interact with RNA polymerase II. Mutagenesis of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat demonstrated that the basic domains of both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat proteins were required for this interaction. Furthermore, ""far Western"" analysis suggested that the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II was the site for interaction with Tat. The interactions between Tat and RNA polymerase II were of similar magnitude to those detected between RNA polymerase II and the cellular transcription factor RAP30, which stably associates with RNA polymerase II during transcriptional elongation. These studies are consistent with the model that RNA polymerase II is a cellular target for Tat resulting in Tat-mediated increases in transcriptional elongation from the HIV long terminal repeat."
2472,0.002,2.0,"The prevalence of human T-cell leukaemia virus-I and -II infection was studied in a cohort of 346 intravenous and nonintravenous drug users in Amsterdam. Three participants (0.86%) had antibodies to HTLV-I by two commercially available HTLV-I enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Infection in these three subjects was confirmed by radioimmunoprecipitation assay. In the immunoblot study, only two of the three subjects were considered positive, since the serum of the third subject had antibodies to p24 only. By means of the polymerase chain reaction two participants (male intravenous drug users infected with human immunodeficiency virus; HIV) appeared to be infected with HTLV-I and one subject (a male nonintravenous drug user from Surinam) with HTLV-II. It is concluded that HTLV-I and HTLV-II circulate sporadically among drug users in Amsterdam and that risky injecting behaviour, which led to an HIV epidemic among intravenous drug users, has not led so far to an appreciable transmission of the other retroviruses among this group."
2623,0.002,2.0,"Reports of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in seronegative individuals prompted the authors to investigate subjects who are at very high risk of acquisition of HIV in San Francisco. Nine HIV seronegative subjects were evaluated extensively, eight of whom were drawn from a well-characterized cohort of seropositive and seronegative homosexual men who have been followed prospectively since 1983-1984. These men have calculated probabilities of infection based on a fitted model of between 0.22 and 0.94. One additional subject is an intravenous drug user who has shared needles with HIV-infected individuals extensively. Peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes were separately cultured from each subject and evidence of HIV infection was sought by a reverse transcriptase assay, enzyme immunoassay, and immunocytofluorographic analysis for HIV antigens, in situ hybridization, RNA slot blot analysis, and polymerase chain reaction amplification of HIV cDNA. Uncultured monocytes and lymphocytes from each donor were also examined by these techniques. Evidence of HIV infection was not found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of these high risk individuals."
9492,0.002,2.0,"In 32 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women, routine gynecologic examination was performed with colposcopy and Papanicolaou smear; cervical swabs were collected for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA screening and typing; and immune status was assessed by CD4 T-cell count. Dot blot analysis was specifically chosen for HPV DNA screening to detect only relatively substantial HPV DNA infections. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was used for precise DNA typing of dot blot-positive samples. The HPV data were assessed for immune status; a subject with a CD4 T-cell count below 200/microL was considered functionally immunosuppressed. The frequency of dot blot positivity was fivefold higher among immunocompromised (nine of ten) than relatively immunocompetent (four of 22) HIV-infected women. Moreover, four immunosuppressed women, compared with no immunocompetent subjects, had evidence of HPV DNA without signs of HPV-associated lesions by cytology or histology (ie, latent HPV infection). Furthermore, four of nine of the immunocompromised, compared with four of 21 immunocompetent, subjects had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. These frequencies are high compared with those reported in the general population. Finally, HPV 18 was detected in five of the ten women with CD4 T-cell counts below 200/microL and in only one of the 22 with CD4 T-cell counts above that level. These results suggest that the normal immune system suppresses latent and clinical HPV cervical infections and that the efficiency of suppression may be HPV type-specific. Furthermore, impaired immune status, as reflected by CD4 T-cell count, is an important factor increasing the severity of HPV-induced cervical infections in this population."

The aim of this study was to correlate the onset of the cerebral ischemic attack accompanied by mixed cryoglobulinemia, with the chronic hepatitis C virus infection. These studies were carried out in 12 patients with serologic/virusologic confirmed chronic HCV infection associated with ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke occurred in equal proportion in women and men. The patients did not know of HCV infection diagnosis at that moment. All patients had type II mixed monoclonal cryoglobulinemia, hypergammaglobulinemia with polyclonal IgG and monoclonal IgM, blood hyperviscosity, high level of cryocrit, positive rheumatoid factor, normal levels of serum transaminases, negative serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag), negative anti HBc antibodies, positive HCV antibodies, positive serum RNA HCV, decreased serum C3 and C4 levels, antinuclear antibodies-false positive. Immunological tests for autoantibodies, namely, anti-Sm antibody, anti-RNP antibody, anti-SS-A and -B antibodies, and anti-Scl antibody were not detectable due to high level serum cryoglobulin. Cryoglobulin was washed several times with an isotonic chloride solution for purification, then subject to immunological analyses. The purified cryoglobulin contained monoclonal IgM-kappa, polyclonal IgG. Cryoglobulinemia is a risk factor for ischemic stroke, as it causes arterial thrombosis."
886,0.002,2.0,"The possession of some HLA class I molecules is associated with delayed progression to AIDS. The mechanism behind this beneficial effect is unclear. We tested the idea that cytotoxic T-cell responses restricted by advantageous HLA class I molecules impose stronger selection pressures than those restricted by other HLA class I alleles. As a measure of the selection pressure imposed by HLA class I alleles, we determined the extent of HLA class I-associated epitope variation in a cohort of European human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals (n=84). We validated our findings in a second, distinct cohort of African patients (n=516). We found that key HIV epitopes restricted by advantageous HLA molecules (B27, B57, and B51 in European patients and B5703, B5801, and B8101 in African patients) were more frequently mutated in individuals bearing the restricting HLA than in those who lacked the restricting HLA class I molecule. HLA alleles associated with clinical benefit restricted certain epitopes for which the consensus peptides were frequently recognized by the immune response despite the circulating virus's being highly polymorphic. We found a significant inverse correlation between the HLA-associated hazard of disease progression and the mean HLA-associated prevalence of mutations within epitopes (P=0.028; R2=0.34). We conclude that beneficial HLA class I alleles impose strong selection at key epitopes. This is revealed by the frequent association between effective T-cell responses and circulating viral escape mutants and the rarity of these variants in patients who lack these favorable HLA class I molecules, suggesting a significant pressure to revert."
9214,0.002,2.0,"The development of an effective maternal HIV-1 vaccine that could synergize with antiretroviral therapy (ART) to eliminate pediatric HIV-1 infection will require the characterization of maternal immune responses capable of blocking transmission of autologous HIV to the infant. We previously determined that maternal plasma antibody binding to linear epitopes within the variable loop 3 (V3) region of HIV envelope (Env) and neutralizing responses against easy-to-neutralize tier 1 viruses were associated with reduced risk of peripartum HIV infection in the historic U.S. Woman and Infant Transmission Study (WITS) cohort. Here, we defined the fine specificity and function of the potentially protective maternal V3-specific IgG antibodies associated with reduced peripartum HIV transmission risk in this cohort. The V3-specific IgG binding that predicted low risk of mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) was dependent on the C-terminal flank of the V3 crown and particularly on amino acid position 317, a residue that has also been associated with breakthrough transmission in the RV144 vaccine trial. Remarkably, the fine specificity of potentially protective maternal plasma V3-specific tier 1 virus-neutralizing responses was dependent on the same region in the V3 loop. Our findings suggest that MTCT risk is associated with neutralizing maternal IgG that targets amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of the V3 loop crown, suggesting the importance of the region in immunogen design for maternal vaccines to prevent MTCT."
6316,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is less pathogenic than HIV type 1 (HIV-1), but the mechanisms underlying this difference have not been defined. We developed an internally controlled quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to measure HIV-2 viral load and determined levels of plasma virus in a cohort of registered commercial sex workers in Dakar, Senegal. The assay has a lower limit of detection of 100 copies/mL and is linear over 4 logs. HIV-2 viral RNA was detectable in 56% of all samples tested; the median load was 141 copies/mL. Levels of viral RNA in the plasma were inversely related to CD4+ cell counts. HIV-2 and HIV-1 viral loads were compared among the seroincident women in the cohort; the median viral load was 30x lower in the HIV-2-infected women (P<.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test), irrespective of the length of time infected. This suggests that plasma viremia is linked to the differences in the pathogenicity of the 2 viruses."
5200,0.002,2.0,"A number of linear and conformation-dependent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been mapped to the first and second variable (V1 and V2) domains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120. The majority of these MAbs are as effective at neutralizing HIV-1 infectivity as MAbs to the V3 domain and the CD4 binding site. The linear MAbs bind to amino acid residues 162 to 171, and changes at residues 183/184 (PI/SG) and 191/192/193 (YSL/GSS) within the V2 domain abrogate the binding of the two conformation-dependent MAbs, 11/68b and CRA-4, respectively. Surprisingly, a change at residue 435 (Y/H or Y/S), in a region of gp120 near the CD4 binding site (M. Kowalski, J. Potz, L. Basiripour, T. Dorfman, W. C. Goh, E. Terwilliger, A. Dayton, C. Rosen, W. Haseltine, and J. Sodroski, Science 237:1351-1355, 1987; L. A. Lasky, G. M. Nakamura, D. H. Smith, C. Fennie, C. Shimasaki, E. Patzer, P. Berman, T. Gregory, and D.

Virol. 64:5701-5707, 1990), abrogated gp120 recognition by both of the conformation-dependent MAbs. However, both MAbs 11/68b and CRA-4 were able to bind to HIV-1 V1V2 chimeric fusion proteins expressing the V1V2 domains in the absence of C4, suggesting that residues in C4 are not components of the epitopes but that amino acid changes in C4 may affect the structure of the V1V2 domains. This is consistent with the ability of soluble CD4 to block 11/68b and CRA-4 binding to both native cell surface-expressed gp120 and recombinant gp120 and suggests that the binding of the neutralizing MAbs to the virus occurs prior to receptor interaction. Since the reciprocal inhibition, i.e., antibody inhibition of CD4-gp120 binding, was not observed, the mechanism of neutralization is probably not a blockade of virus-receptor interaction. Finally, we demonstrate that linear sequences from the V2 region are immunogenic in HIV-1-infected individuals, suggesting that the primary neutralizing response may be directed to both V2 and V3 epitopes."
8812,0.002,2.0,"We evaluated the performance of a hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigen/antibody combination test [Murex HCV Antigen/Antibody Combination Test (Murex Ag/Ab test)] by comparing it with the current third-generation HCV antibody enzyme immunoassay (anti-HCV). A total of 403 serum samples were consecutively collected from four patient groups: healthy controls (n=100); HCV-infected patients (HCV group, n=102); Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV-infected patients (HIV/HCV group, n=100); and patients with uremia (uremia group, n=101). Performances were evaluated for the Murex Ag/Ab, anti-HCV, and HCV RNA in the HIV/HCV and uremia patient groups. In the HCV group, all 102 samples showed concordant positive and negative results for anti-HCV, Murex Ag/Ab, and HCV RNA tests. In the HIV/HCV group, all 100 samples were positive for both anti-HCV and Murex Ag/Ab tests, whereas 88 patients (88%) were HCV RNA positive. In the uremia group, 14 (69.0%) of the 23 anti-HCV-positive patients were HCV RNA positive, whereas 14 (77.8%) of the 18 Murex Ag/Ab-positive patients were HCV RNA positive. None of anti-HCV-negative or Murex Ag/Ab-negative patients were HCV RNA positive. Based on the HCV RNA assay, the sensitivities for both anti-HCV and Murex Ag/Ab assays were 100%, whereas the specificities of these two assays were 89.7% and 95.4%, respectively. With good sensitivity and specificity, the Murex Ag/Ab assay could be a useful alternative diagnostic tool, especially in immunocompromised populations, such as patients with uremia or those infected with HIV."
2318,0.002,2.0,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI) is defined as the presence of HBV DNA in the liver (with or without detectable HBV DNA in serum) for individuals testing HBV surface antigen negative. Until recently, the clinical effect of OBI was unclear on the progression of liver disease; on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma; and on the risk for reactivation or transmission of HBV infection. Several studies suggest a high prevalence of OBI among patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease, but its role in the progression to cirrhosis remains unclear. Although OBI has been well documented in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, especially among those coinfected with hepatitis C virus, further studies are needed to determine its current clinical impact in HIV setting."
5259,0.002,2.0,"Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) remains prevalent in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. Memory function is commonly affected. There is a need for a rapid, but sensitive screening tool. This study compares the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) and a computerised battery cognitive assessment to establish if the questionnaire has potential as a rapid screening tool for HIV-associated NCI. Neurologically asymptomatic patients with an undetectable HIV viral load on stable HAART were eligible to participate. Asymptomatic NCI (aNCI) was defined as a performance score more than 1SD below the normative mean in at least two domains of the computerised test. Memory impairment (MI) was defined as a t-score more than 1 SD below the normative mean using the PRMQ. Forty-five subjects participated. The mean age was 48 years (SD 11), the mean CD4 count was 546 cells/mul (SD 271), and 84% were male. Of subjects, 14/45 (24%) had NCI and 15/45 (33%) had MI. Two subjects had both types of impairment. No significant association was found between the presence of aNCI and MI (p = 0.229, r = 0.18, 95% CI -1.2, 0.23). aNCI was statistically significantly associated with younger age (p = 0.38, r = 0.31, 95% CI -0.02, 0.001). MI was statistically significantly associated with the set-shifting cognitive domain of the computerized battery (p = 0.04, r = 0.326) and time elapsed since HIV diagnosis (p = 0.035, r = 0.316). High rates of asymptomatic NCI were observed in this cohort, especially in younger individuals. The memory questionnaire did not reliably identify HIV-associated NCI other than executive function deficits and based on our data should therefore not be used as a rapid screening tool for this purpose."

2546,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a worldwide public health concern. The circulation of strains carrying mutations in the viral proteins implies both clinical and therapeutics challenges. HBV complete genomes (HBV-CGs) were reported from injecting drug users and HBV chronically infected patients from Argentina-including Amerindians-although no studies were conducted in blood donors. Here, we described HBV-CG sequences from the latter population. Some of the HBV sequences classified as B2 and C2 subgenotypes clustering together with Asian isolates, while others, such as D3, F1b, and F4, were homologous to European and Latin America sequences. New substitutions for all analyzed open reading frames and changes in the HBsAg hydrophobicity profiles were detected. Several HBV-CG subgenotypes are described for the first time in this population. Mutations observed in X, PreS, and P proteins have been associated with advanced liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or natural resistance to nucleos(t)ide antiviral treatment. It deserves to be highlighted that these substitutions were detected in a population without epidemiological risk factors for viral infection, and most importantly, without any previous antiviral treatment (natural resistance). Regarding the remaining mutations, further research is warranted in order to determine their clinical and therapeutics relevance."
9795,0.002,2.0,"Current treatment options for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are not curative as they are not effective in eliminating covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). cccDNA is a stable template for HBV transcription in the nucleus of hepatocytes and is thought to be one of the main factors responsible for HBV persistence. Recently, activation of the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) has been shown to trigger degradation of cccDNA through induction of cytidine deaminases of the APOBEC3 family in HBV cell culture model systems. To assess the presence and relevance of such mechanisms in the liver of chronically HBV-infected patients, we compared intrahepatic cccDNA levels with the expression levels of lymphotoxins and some of their target genes (eg APOBEC deaminases) in liver biopsy tissue. Our results confirm elevated gene expression levels of components of the lymphotoxin pathway including lymphotoxin alpha (LTα), lymphotoxin beta (LTβ), APOBEC3B (A3B) and APOBEC3G (A3G) in the chronically HBV-infected liver compared to uninfected liver. Furthermore, expression levels of the genes of the APOBEC deaminase family were correlated with those of LTα and LTβ gene expression, consistent with lymphotoxin-mediated upregulation of APOBEC gene expression. However, intrahepatic cccDNA and HBV replication levels were not correlated with LTα, LTβ and APOBEC gene expression. In conclusion, these results suggest that although the lymphotoxin pathway is activated in the chronically HBV-infected liver, it has no major impact on HBV cccDNA metabolism in chronic HBV infection."
4261,0.002,2.0,"The cytosine analog 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC) has been shown to be an effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, several liver transplant patients who were undergoing treatment with 3TC for HBV infection experienced a breakthrough of virus while on 3TC. The predominant virus found in these patients' sera contained either a valine or isoleucine for the methionine in the highly conserved YMDD nucleotide binding site in the HBV polymerase. To determine the biological relevance of the Met-to-Val substitution, we mutated a plasmid that contained a cDNA copy of the HBV pregenomic RNA such that when virus replication occurred during transient transfection of HepG2 cells, an M539V polymerase variant was produced. We found that in transiently transfected cells, this variant was approximately 330-fold less sensitive to the antiviral effects of 3TC and produced 7-fold less viral DNA than the wild type."
4732,0.002,2.0,"Coinfections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV are very frequent. Although HBV is a DNA virus, it replicates via reverse transcription like HIV. Structural similarities between the enzymatic pocket of the HBV DNA polymerase and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase are the basis that certain drugs inhibit both enzymes and thus the replication of both viruses. HBV components increase the pathogenic action of HIV and vice versa directly by certain proteins like HBsAg in the case of HBV and HIV-encoded Tat and Vpr and by disturbing the cytokine balance in affected cells. Antiretroviral therapy is highly beneficial for HIV/HBV-coinfected patients, but carries the risk of drug-induced resistance development and hepatotoxicity. Even with restoration of the immune capacity, signs of hepatic inflammation may develop even after 10 years of treatment."
4579,0.002,2.0,"The development and application of nucleoside (and nucleotide) analogues for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection will transform the management of this condition. For instance, treatment with lamivudine effects a dramatic and measurable reduction of serum virus titre. This is associated with biochemical and histological improvements. Unfortunately, for the majority, replication resumes when treatment is withdrawn. Prolonged lamividine treatment may be associated with the emergence of drug-resistant species with specific polymerase mutations. Compared with the observed rate for the development of drug resistance observed during monotherapy of HIV infection, resistance is slow to emerge during treatment of hepatitis B. The rate of emergence might be dependent on the rate of infected hepatocyte turnover, which is extremely variable in chronic HBV infection (and significantly slower than infected lymphocyte turnover during HIV infection). Preliminary data suggest that pretreatment serum virus titre may be an important predictor of the development of drug resistance, an observation consistent with preexistance of the resistant virus in the hepatitis B virus quasispecies. Akin to developments in antiviral treatment of HIV infection, further progress in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B will depend on the development of drugs for use in combination therapy."
8810,0.002,2.0,"Mutations associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) resistance to lamivudine have not been extensively addressed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-HBV coinfection. We have studied the HBV polymerase sequences from nine coinfected patients who experienced HBV recurrence while under lamivudine treatment. In seven of these nine patients, Met(550), belonging to the highly conserved YMDD motif, was mutated to Val and was associated with a substitution of Met for Leu(526) in each case. In the two remaining patients, we found a Met(550)-to-Ile change that was associated in only one case with a Leu(526)-to-Met mutation. No mutation was observed in three control patients not receiving lamivudine. This study demonstrates the emergence of particular genetic profiles in HBV-HIV-coinfected patients experiencing a loss of control of HBV infection despite high doses of lamivudine."

2336,0.002,2.0,"Recently, hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and mutations have been reported to be related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This cross-sectional case-control study examined the relationship between HCC and mutations in the enhancer II/core promoter and precore regions of HBV by comparing 135 Korean HCC patients infected with HBV genotype C2 (HBV/C2; HCC group) with 135 age-, sex-, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status-matched patients without HCC (non- HCC group). Age and sex were also matched between HBeAg-positive and -negative patients. The prevalence of T1653, A1689, V1753, T1762/A1764, T1846, A1850, C1858, and A1896 mutations was evaluated in this population. The prevalence of the T1653 mutation in the box alpha region, the T1689 [corrected] mutation in between the box alpha and beta regions, and the T1762/A1764 mutations in the basal core promoter region was significantly higher in the HCC group compared to the non-HCC group (8.9% vs. 2.2%, P = 0.017; 19.3% vs. 4.4%, P < 0.001; and 60.7% vs. 22.2%; P < 0.001). Among HBeAg-negative patients, the frequency of the T1653 mutation was higher in the HCC group. Regardless of HBeAg status, the prevalence of the T1689, [corrected] and T1762/A1764 mutations was higher in the HCC group than in the non-HCC group. However, no association was observed between mutations in the precore region and HCC. Upon multivariate analysis, the presence of the T1653, T1689, [corrected] and T1762/A1764 mutations was an independent predictive factor for HCC. The addition of the T1653 or T1689 [corrected] mutation to T1762/A1764 increased the risk of HCC. In conclusion, the T1653, T1689, [corrected] and/or T1762/A1764 mutations were associated with the development of HCC in Korean patients infected with HBV/C2."
2759,0.002,2.0,"This study assessed the association of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in a highly HBV-endemic area. The prevalence of either HBV or HCV infection in 235 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was compared with that of an age- and sex-matched hospital control group of 235 patients. The prevalence of HBV infection was higher in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (15.5%) than control (8.1%), but the prevalence of HCV infection in the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients (2.1%) and control group (3%) was similar. HBV prevalence increased significantly with age in the B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. The presence of HBV proteins and DNA in lymphoma tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HBV-infected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients was also investigated using immunohistochemistry and PCR. HBV DNA was frequently detected in PBMCs from HBV-infected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients, but HBV antigens were not. Therefore, HBV infection, but not HCV infection, was associated with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Korea, suggesting a possible role for HBV in the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Research priorities include improved and point-of-care TB diagnostics; TB treatment and prevention during HIV infection, drug-resistant TB, and childhood TB; and optimization of TB and HIV program integration. With new TB diagnostics and drugs reaching approval, research must focus on effectively deploying these advancements. Research must include evaluations of individual, household, health care, and community approaches.

8650,0.002,2.0,"Characterization of virus-specific immune responses to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is important to understanding the early virus-host interactions that may determine the course of virus infection and disease. Using a comprehensive panel of serological assays, we have previously demonstrated a complex and lengthy maturation of virus-specific antibody responses elicited by attenuated strains of SIV that was closely associated with the development of protective immunity. In the present study, we expand these analyses to address several questions regarding the nature of the virus-specific antibody responses to pathogenic SIV, SIV/HIV-1 (SHIV), and HIV-1 infections. The results demonstrate for the first time a common theme of antibody maturation to SIV, SHIV, and HIV-1 infections that is characterized by ongoing changes in antibody titer, conformational dependence, and antibody avidity during the first 6 to 10 months following virus infection. We demonstrate that this gradual evolution of virus-specific antibody responses is independent of the levels of virus replication and the pathogenicity of the infection viral strain. While the serological assays used in these studies were useful in discriminating between protective and nonprotective antibody responses during evaluation of vaccine efficacy with attenuated SIV, these same assays do not distinguish the clinical outcome of infection in pathogenic SIV, SHIV, or HIV-1 infections. These results likely reflect differences in the immune mechanisms involved in mediating protection from virus challenge compared to those that control an established viral infection, and they suggest that additional characteristics of both humoral and cellular responses evolve during this early immune maturation."
7829,0.002,2.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic continues to grow at an alarming rate, with a further 5 million new infections in 2003. Some 3.5 million of these were in sub-Saharan Africa, where approximately 70% of the world's HIV-positive population resides. In contrast, the spread of HIV in high-income countries has slowed since its discovery in the 1980s, and in regions such as Western Europe prevalence has decreased. Here, we employ coalescent methods to compare the epidemic growth rates of two subtypes of HIV-1 with differing epidemiological profiles: subtype C, which is dominant in sub-Saharan Africa and associated with heterosexual transmission, and subtype B, the main cause of AIDS in Western Europe and North America, and which was primarily transmitted through homosexual sex and injecting drug use. We show that although both subtypes emerged at approximately the same time ( approximately 1960), they have widely differing patterns of exponential population growth. At its current growth rate the epidemic of subtype C in sub-Saharan Africa is doubling every 2.4 years, which is approximately half the rate observed during the early stages of the subtype B epidemic in Western Europe and North America. However, the subtype C growth rate is still 5-10 times greater than that estimated for the blood-borne hepatitis C virus, supporting the hypothesis that sexual transmission has been primarily responsible for the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa."
3079,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an important health problem worldwide. The virus has been classified according to 8 genotypes (A-H) based on sequence divergence. Most genotypes have specific geographic distributions; genotypes A and D are prevalent in Western Europe and North America, and genotypes B and C are prevalent in East Asia and Oceania. Currently accepted treatment for chronic hepatitis B includes interferon alpha, or the nucleoside/nucleotide analogues lamivudine and adefovir. The impact of HBV genotypes on response to antiviral therapy has been studied. HBV genotypes D and C are associated with a lower rate of favorable response to interferon alpha therapy than genotypes A and B, respectively. A study in Germany suggested that the rate of resistance to lamivudine was higher in patients with HBV genotype A infection than in patients with genotype D infection. No difference in the risk of lamivudine resistance is found between patients with genotype B and patients with genotype C. In patients with genotype C infection, however, virological response is worse during lamivudine therapy, and is also less durable after the discontinuation of therapy than in patients with genotype B infection. Determining the genotype could be helpful for predicting the outcome of antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B."

Phylogenetic analysis revealed diverse HBV subgenotypes including A2 and A6 (46.8%), D1-D4 (38.8%), E (9.7%), C1 (1.6%), and B2 (1.6%). The study population consisted of patients with different ethnic origin (Caucasian, Turkish, Asian, Arab, and African). One HBV D/C recombinant isolate was identified, which encoded subtype adw2. An HBV subgenotype D4 with an aberrant subtype ayw4 was detected. Although none of the genotypes was associated with a specific disease outcome, several nucleotide substitutions, deletions and insertions were observed within the HBV preS1/S and X genes, particularly among patients with active chronic hepatitis B infection and patients with cirrhosis. Within the immunological domain of the HBsAg gene, the most frequent substitutions were sT125M and sT118A. High rates of precore and basal core promoter mutations were detected in patients infected with genotype D of HBV. Almost half of the patients who received lamivudine therapy for at least 1 year had HBV variants associated with lamivudine drug resistance. In conclusion, the most common HBV genotypes in West Europe (A and D) also prevail in Belgium. The highest degree of genetic diversity was detected in HBV genotype D.

Nineteen hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients (eight with liver cirrhosis and 11 with chronic hepatitis) and 18 healthy controls were studied in a period free of other infection. Mitogen-stimulated cellular interleukin 2 receptor expression, soluble interleukin 2 receptor release, and interleukin 2 production were studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured for 24 h. No difference was demonstrated between the patients and healthy controls in the cellular interleukin 2 receptor expression, soluble interleukin 2 receptor release, and interleukin 2 production. Pokeweed mitogen-stimulated interleukin 2 production in lymphocytes from cirrhotic patients was significantly lower than that of the noncirrhotic patients. However, the cellular and soluble interleukin 2 receptor levels did not differ between the two groups of chronic HBV carriers. Despite the fact that it has been suggested that autoreactive T cells have a role in mediating the development of chronic liver diseases associated with HBV infection, this study fails to demonstrate a defective T lymphocyte activation in these patients. The observed reduction of interleukin 2 production from activated lymphocytes may be related to the severity of liver impairment, rather than the HBV infection itself."
3223,0.002,2.0,"The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are promising non-virus-encoded targets for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) therapy. We describe a selection procedure to isolate mutant forms of RANTES (CCL5) with antiviral activity considerably in excess of that of the native chemokine. The phage-displayed library of randomly mutated and N-terminally extended variants was screened by using live CCR5-expressing cells, and two of the selected mutants, P1 and P2, were further characterized. Both were significantly more potent HIV inhibitors than RANTES, with P2 being the most active (50% inhibitory concentration of 600 pM in a viral coat-mediated cell fusion assay, complete protection of target cells against primary HIV type 1 strains at a concentration of 10 nM). P2 resembles AOP-RANTES in that it is a superagonist of CCR5 and potently induces receptor sequestration. P1, while less potent than P2, has the advantage of significantly reduced signaling activity via CCR5 (30% of that of RANTES). Additionally, both P1 and P2 exhibit not only significantly increased affinity for CCR5 but also enhanced receptor selectivity, retaining only trace levels of signaling activity via CCR1 and CCR3. The phage chemokine approach that was successfully applied here could be adapted to other chemokine-chemokine receptor systems and used to further improve the first-generation mutants reported in this paper."
1002,0.002,2.0,"CD81 has been described as a putative receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV); however, its role in HCV cell entry has not been characterized due to the lack of an efficient cell culture system. We have examined the role of CD81 in HCV glycoprotein-dependent entry by using a recently developed retroviral pseudotyping system. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pseudotypes bearing HCV E1E2 glycoproteins show a restricted tropism for human liver cell lines. Although all of the permissive cell lines express CD81, CD81 expression alone is not sufficient to allow viral entry. CD81 is required for HIV-HCV pseudotype infection since (i) a monoclonal antibody specific for CD81 inhibited infection of susceptible target cells and (ii) silencing of CD81 expression in Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells by small interfering RNAs inhibited HIV-HCV pseudotype infection. Furthermore, expression of CD81 in human liver cells that were previously resistant to infection, HepG2 and HH29, conferred permissivity of HCV pseudotype infection. The characterization of chimeric CD9/CD81 molecules confirmed that the large extracellular loop of CD81 is a determinant for viral entry. These data suggest a functional role for CD81 as a coreceptor for HCV glycoprotein-dependent viral cell entry."

This is the first report that describes the detection and serial measurements of anti-ganglioside antibody in a patient with HIV infection.

6155,0.002,2.0,"In hepatitis B virus carriers who are anti-HBe positive despite ongoing viral replication (HBcAg in liver and HBV-DNA in serum) the natural course of hepatitis is severe and the response to interferon is low. We investigated whether a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) strain could be involved. A translational termination codon at the carboxyterminal end of the pre-C region responsible for the lack of HBeAg secretion was found in 18 of 19 HBV clones isolated from seven pedigreed patients with this clinical syndrome. The same findings were confirmed by direct sequencing. One of these patients underwent a liver transplant and HBV infection of the new liver resulted in high titered viremia and intrahepatic expression of HBcAg, without detectable HBeAg in serum. Another patient was superinfected by hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and developed high titres of total and IgM anti-HD. In spite of this, chronic hepatitis remained unchanged during 7 years of follow-up. These data strongly suggest that a viable precore minus mutant of hepatitis B virus is responsible for the lack of HBeAg in the serum of these patients. The HBV variant may explain the peculiar geographic distribution of anti-HBe positive hepatitis. The variations in the virus genome sequence may cause the more severe form of liver disease and modify the pathogenicity in the case of HDV superinfection."

With regard to establishing and/or maintaining virological suppression over 48 weeks in randomized, phase III trials, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF was noninferior to elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive adults, and statistically superior (subsequent to established noninferiority) to ongoing treatment with tenofovir DF-containing regimens in ART-experienced adults with virological suppression. In single-arm, phase III trials, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF also provided high rates of virological suppression among ART-naive adolescents and ART-experienced adults with stable renal impairment. In general, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF was well tolerated and associated with more favourable renal and bone parameters, but a less favourable lipid profile, than tenofovir DF-containing regimens. Thus, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF is an alternative single-tablet regimen for adults and adolescents with HIV-1 infection, particularly those with an estimated creatinine clearance of ≥30 to <50 mL/min or an increased risk of tenofovir DF-related bone toxicity.

3614,0.002,2.0,"Antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with once-daily dosing of tenofovir and tenofovir-emtricitabine was shown to be effective for preventing HIV-1 infection in individuals who had HIV-1-seropositive partners (the Partners PrEP Study). We developed a population pharmacokinetic model for tenofovir and investigated the impacts of different dose reporting methods. Dosing information was collected as patient-reported dosing information (PRDI) from 404 subjects (corresponding to 1,280 drug concentration records) from the main trial and electronic monitoring-based adherence data collected from 211 subjects (corresponding to 327 drug concentration records) in an ancillary adherence study. Model development was conducted with NONMEM (7.2), using PRDI with a steady-state assumption or using PRDI replaced with electronic monitoring records where available. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption was the best model in both modeling approaches, with the need for an absorption lag time when electronic monitoring-based dosing records were included in the analysis. Age, body weight, and creatinine clearance were significant covariates on clearance, but only creatinine clearance was retained in the final models per stepwise selection. Sex was not a significant covariate on clearance. Tenofovir population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates and the precisions of the parameters from the two final models were comparable with the point estimates of the parameters, differing from 0% to 35%, and bootstrap confidence intervals widely overlapped. These findings indicate that PRDI was sufficient for population pharmacokinetic model development in this study, with a high level of adherence per multiple measures."

A retrospective study was performed in 67 chronic HD and 36 peritoneal dialysis patients. For the screening of viral infections, we tested for anti-HCV antibodies and HBs antigen (Hbs Ag). We compared infected and non-infected patients in order to determine the risk factors for contamination. In the HD unit, the prevalence of anti-HCV was 60% and the prevalence of HBs Ag was 6%. Duration of dialysis (P = 0.001) was the only risk factor in our HD patients. In peritoneal dialysis (PD), the prevalence of anti-HCV was 8%. Hbs Ag was detected in 2.6% of our PD patients. Viral hepatitis C is the main viral infection in our HD unit. The duration of dialysis is the main risk factor for infection in our study. The transmission is essentially nosocomial, requiring a strict adherence to infection control procedures. "

None of the patients had evidence of neurological complications. History of alcohol consumption was an exclusion criterion. The values of central conduction times I-V and III-V showed significant differences between the HIV-seropositive subjects and normal healthy controls, as well as between the HIV-seropositive subjects and HIV-negative drug abusers. Central conduction times I-III showed no differences between groups, except in the left ear of Centers for Disease Control group IV compared with controls. No statistical differences were found in the central conduction times between HIV-negative drug abusers and normal healthy controls. The results suggest a subclinical involvement of the upper brain stem in HIV infection. It could be produced by direct action of the virus on central nervous system structures."

6288,0.002,2.0,"Zidovudine is widely prescribed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Trimethoprim and dapsone are commonly used in the management of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected patients. To examine the pharmacokinetic interactions among these drugs, eight HIV-infected patients (26 to 43 years old) with a mean CD4 count of 524.4 +/- 405.7 cells per mm3 received zidovudine (200 mg), trimethoprim (200 mg), and dapsone (100 mg) as single agents and in two- and three-drug combinations. Blood and urine samples were collected at a specified time and analyzed for zidovudine, zidovudine-glucuronide, trimethoprim, dapsone, and monoacetyl-dapsone concentrations under single-dose and steady-state conditions. Zidovudine did not influence the pharmacokinetic disposition of dapsone or trimethoprim. Dapsone had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of zidovudine. Trimethoprim significantly decreased the renal clearance of zidovudine by 58% (5.0 +/- 1.8 versus 2.1 +/- 0.5 ml/min/kg of body weight [P < 0.05]). There was a concurrent 54% decrease in the mean urinary recovery of zidovudine (11.7 +/- 3.5 versus 5.4 +/- 3.0 [P < 0.05]), and the metabolic ratio was decreased by 78% (0.32 +/- 0.4 versus 0.07 +/- 0.05 [P < 0.05]). The mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 6 h of the zidovudine-glucuronide/ zidovudine ratio was unchanged. We conclude that zidovudine, trimethoprim, and dapsone can be coadministered to patients with AIDS without significant pharmacokinetic interaction. However, in AIDS patients with liver impairment and impaired glucuronidation, doses of zidovudine may need to be decreased."
7267,0.002,2.0,"Nosocomial transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is a recognized risk in health care settings, and is a particular concern in settings where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons receive care. TB control guidelines have been effective in prevention of nosocomial TB outbreaks and protection of patients and health care workers. In 1993 a South Florida academic medical center noted an increase in TB cases, particularly in HIV-infected persons who had been inpatients. A multidisciplinary team developed an HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway as an intervention to deter nosocomial transmission of TB. The pathway was implemented in 1995 on the Special Immunology/Infectious Disease (SI/ID) inpatient unit. This paper describes an evaluation study conducted to determine the effectiveness of the pathway as an intervention to deter nosocomial TB in relation to two areas: (1) early identification of HIV-infected patients with potential TB, followed by immediate placement in respiratory isolation and (2) protection of SI/ID unit personnel from occupational TB exposure. A retrospective review was conducted in June 1999 on the medical records of all patients who had been placed on the HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway from 1995-1998. A review was also done of the medical center's confirmed TB cases, and employee health records for tuberculin skin testing (TST) of employees during this time period. The review demonstrated that all HIV-infected patients with confirmed TB had been identified, placed on the pathway and admitted to respiratory isolation at the onset of hospital admission, deterring the potential for a nosocomial TB outbreak. However, in 1998 two SI/ID staff converted from a nonreactive to a reactive TST. Although the pathway was only partially successful in TB protection for staff members, other factors may have caused the TST conversions. A study recommendation is that institutions develop an HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway, along with a Rule Out TB Pathway for patients who are not HIV-infected but present with symptoms that may be indicative of TB infection."
801,0.002,2.0,"Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is recognised as an important component of collaborative tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activities to reduce the burden of TB in people living with HIV (PLHIV). However, there has been little in the way of IPT implementation at country level. This failure has resulted in a recent call to arms under the banner title of the 'Three I's' (infection control to prevent nosocomial transmission of TB in health care settings, intensified TB case finding and IPT). In this paper, we review the background of IPT. We then discuss the important challenges of IPT in PLHIV, namely responsibility and accountability for the implementation, identification of latent TB infection, exclusion of active TB and prevention of isoniazid resistance, length of treatment and duration of protective efficacy. We also highlight several research questions that currently remain unanswered. We finally offer practical suggestions about how to scale up IPT in the field, including the need to integrate IPT into a package of care for PLHIV, the setting up of operational projects with the philosophy of 'learning while doing', the development of flow charts for eligibility for IPT, the development and implementation of care prior to antiretroviral treatment, and finally issues around procurement, distribution, monitoring and evaluation. We support the implementation of IPT, but only if it is done in a safe and structured way. There is a definite risk that 'sloppy' IPT will be inefficient and, worse, could lead to the development of multidrug-resistant TB, and this must be avoided at all costs."
4697,0.002,2.0,"Body composition in HIV-infected individuals is subject to many influences. We conducted a pilot 6-month randomized trial of 68 women living with AIDS (WLA) from rural India. High protein intervention combined with education and supportive care delivered by HIV-trained village women (activated social health activist [Asha] life [AL]) was compared to standard protein with usual care delivered by village community assistants (usual care [UC]). Measurements included CD4 counts, ART adherence, socio-demographics, disease characteristics (questionnaires); and anthropometry (bioimpedance analyzer). Repeated measures analysis of variance modeled associations. AL significantly gained in BMI, muscle mass, fat mass, ART adherence, and CD4 counts compared to UC, with higher weight and muscle mass gains among ART adherent (≥66%) participants who had healthier immunity (CD4 ≥450). BMI of WLA improved through high protein supplementation combined with education and supportive care. Future research is needed to determine which intervention aspect was most responsible."
2932,0.002,2.0,"This study determined what physiotherapists in Durban, South Africa know about human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), their attitudes towards patients and how they cope as individuals. Data were collected using a validated questionnaire. One-hundred-and-fourteen physiotherapists in Durban hospitals participated in the study. Seventy-two per cent of the questionnaires met the criteria for analysis. Ninety per cent of the participants believed that they knew about HIV/AIDS, but only 78% could identify all viral transmission modes. Of the 38 physiotherapists who believed that they knew the stages of an HIV infection, only 11% actually knew the stages, 28% could not explain them and 61% were vaguely aware. Fifty-six per cent of the respondents had treated patients who had died from HIV/AIDS. Only 38% of physiotherapists were completely at ease when treating HIV/AIDS patients despite the fact that 98% believed that physiotherapy was an integral component of the management of an AIDS patient. Fifty-one per cent of the respondents were unaware of support structures provided by their employers. The authors conclude that the perceptions of physiotherapists about their knowledge about HIV/AIDS do not stand up to scrutiny. Significantly more attention should be paid to the development, implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of educational programmes on HIV/AIDS for physiotherapists in the workplace."
9617,0.002,2.0,"Unintegrated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA are viral DNA products formed naturally during HIV replication. While the integrated proviral DNA form is transcriptionally active and results in productive infection, unintegrated DNA is also capable of expression of viral RNA and proteins. Previously, we showed that HIV Vpr enhances expression from integrase-defective HIV. Here we show that Vpr activation of expression is partially dependent upon the presence of a transcriptionally active HIV promoter and results in increased transcription of unspliced gag and spliced nef viral RNA. While Tat is detectable during infection with integrase-defective HIV, Tat levels are not affected by the presence of Vpr. Mutation studies reveal that Tat is dispensable for the Vpr-mediated enhancement of expression from unintegrated DNA. We find that virion-associated Vpr is sufficient for Nef expression from unintegrated viral DNA, resulting in the efficient downregulation of CD4 from the surface of infected cells. These results provide a mechanism by which Nef expression from unintegrated HIV type 1 DNA expression occurs."
7532,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects the central nervous system (CNS) and plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of AIDS dementia. However, mechanisms underlying HIV-1 gene expression in the CNS are poorly understood. The importance of CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP) for HIV-1 expression in cells of the immune system has been recently reported. In this study, we have examined the role and the molecular mechanisms by which proteins of the C/EBP family regulate HIV-1 gene transcription in human brain cells. We found that NF-IL6 acts as a potent activator of the long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven transcription in microglial and oligodendroglioma cells. In contrast, C/EBPgamma inhibits NF-IL6-induced activation. Consistent with previous data, our transient expression results show cell-type-specific NF-IL6-mediated transactivation. In glial cells, full activation needs the presence of the C/EBP binding sites; however, NF-IL6 is still able to function via the minimal -40/+80 region. In microglial cells, C/EBP sites are not essential, since NF-IL6 acts through the -68/+80 LTR region, containing two binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1. Moreover, we show that functional interactions between NF-IL6 and Sp1 lead to synergistic transcriptional activation of the LTR in oligodendroglioma and to mutual repression in microglial cells. We further demonstrate that NF-IL6 physically interacts with the nuclear receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), via its DNA binding domain, in vitro and in cells, which results in mutual transcriptional repression. These findings reveal how the interplay of NF-IL6 and C/EBPgamma, together with Sp1 and COUP-TF, regulates HIV-1 gene transcription in brain cells."

In this study, the possible association between the HBV genomic heterogeneity and intrauterine infection was investigated by comparing the quasi species isolated from eight pairs of HBsAg-positive mothers and their neonates, who were infected intrauterinely with HBV, with clones from eight HBsAg-positive mothers whose neonates were not infected with HBV. The proportion of clones with specific mutations was compared among different subject groups, and phylogenetic analysis was performed to evaluate the significance of specific mutations. It was observed that the core promoter with conserved major functional regions and conserved hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) might be beneficial to HBV maternal-fetal transmission. Particularly, A1762T/G1764A mutations seemed to be disadvantageous for fetal infection. It was also shown that amino acid substitutions located in the immune epitopes of HBsAg were strongly associated with intrauterine HBV transmission. The clones with mutations such as amino acid P110S in preS1 region, P36L in preS2 region and C107R in S region might infect fetuses more readily. In addition, positively selected site analysis confirmed the above results."

Of the 55 subjects studied, major mutations conferring HIV drug resistance were present in 10 (18%). Eight (15%) had nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations, with the majority (6) having the K103N mutation; 2 (4%) had nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutations; and 2 (4%) had protease inhibitor (PI) mutations. Phenotypic drug resistance was present in 12 (22%) subjects: 10 (18%) for NNRTIs, 2 (4%) for NRTIs, and 3 (5.5%) for PIs. The prevalence of primary HIV-1 drug resistance, particularly to NNRTIs, in this group of recently infected youth was high."

9297,0.002,2.0,"Increased expression of CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain is consistently observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) central nervous system (CNS) disease. The molecular basis for the correlation between increased expression of CCL2 and HIV neuropathogenesis has been linked to a polymorphism at -2578 in the promoter of human CCL2, which was reported to influence the rate of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the predisposition of HIV-infected individuals to develop HIV-associated dementia. However, because the rate of neurological deterioration essentially parallels the progression of immunosuppression, it is inherently difficult to uncouple the influence of this polymorphism on increased progression to AIDS from increased propensity to develop CNS complications. To further investigate the correlation between CCL2 and HIV/SIV CNS disease, the authors sequenced the CCL2 promoter of 29 pigtailed macaques examined in their accelerated and consistent SIV model in which all infected macaques develop AIDS but only 69% developed moderate/severe CNS lesions. Sequence analysis identified 39 sites of nucleotide variation in the pigtailed macaque CCL2 promoter/enhancer regions, with the resulting consensus sequence aligning with 94.7% homology to the human CCL2 promoter. After genetic analyses, no variation was found to correlate with the incidence or severity of CNS lesions or with levels of CCL2 in plasma or CSF. These findings suggest that the determinants of neuropathogenesis in this SIV model are distinct from variation in these regions of the CCL2 promoter."
9879,0.002,2.0,"As antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has become more effective, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has emerged as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. HIV alters HCV clinical presentation, epidemiology, virology, and pathogenesis compared with HCV monoinfected individuals. The incidence of chronic and vertical HCV infection is increased, the rate of hepatic fibrosis progression is accelerated, peripheral and intrahepatic HCV RNA levels are increased, and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and cirrhosis develop more rapidly in coinfected individuals. Based on these observations, combined with the increased efficacy of ARV therapy, several societies have recommended the diagnosis and treatment of HCV in coinfected individuals. HCV treatment with nonspecific antivirals, pegylated interferon alpha (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), is more complex in coinfected individuals compared with monoinfected individuals because these regimens appear to have decreased efficacy and the incidence of complications is increased. Although new HCV-specific regimens show early promise in HCV monoinfected individuals, it is likely that these agents will be used in combination with nonspecific therapies and additional studies will be required to evaluate their efficacy in coinfected individuals."
7054,0.002,2.0,"Few data are available about the treatment of chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV-infected persons with active drug or alcohol addiction and psychiatric disorders. We report the case of a 42-year-old man who entered care with a CD4+ cell count of 78/microL but was reluctant to take many of the available antiretroviral agents. For many years, periods of sobriety and good adherence to antiretroviral medications were interspersed with relapses to heroin, cocaine, and alcohol use as well as episodes of overdose, major depression with psychiatric hospitalization, incarceration, and discontinuation of antiretroviral medications. After 4 years of HIV primary care, the patient was stabilized to begin therapy for hepatitis C with pegylated interferon and ribavirin with the support of a multidisciplinary team. After starting treatment for hepatitis C, the patient achieved an early virologic response and continues to have an undetectable HCV RNA level by polymerase chain reaction testing and 100% adherence to on-site pegylated interferon injections, without adverse events related to his addiction or psychiatric symptoms. This case suggests that HIV-HCV-coinfected persons with the common comorbidities of polysubstance dependence and psychiatric illness may effectively and safely undergo pharmacotherapy for hepatitis C with appropriate support."
1766,0.002,2.0,"Hypersensitivity adverse drug reactions are much more common among patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) than in the general population. High rates of hypersensitivity reactions to clindamycin have been noted. To investigate the role of reactive metabolites in these reactions, the authors studied toxicity of clindamycin and sulphamethoxazole (SMX) and their metabolites in uninfected and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected MOLT3 cells. Infected and uninfected cells were incubated with clindamycin or sulphamethoxazole hydroxylamine in increasing concentrations; reactive metabolites were generated by coincubation of cells and drug with murine microsomes and a microsomal activating system. Over a concentration range of 0 to 400 microM SMX-HA, there was a significant concentration-dependent increase in cell death in HIV-infected compared to uninfected cells (28%+/-3% vs 8%+/-5% at 400 microM, P < .05). In contrast, coincubation of cells with clindamycin, microsomes, and a microsomal activating system, as well as combinations of primaquine or pyrimethamine, was not associated with an increase in cell death among infected compared to uninfected cells. No concentration-toxicity was demonstrated. These data support the role of reactive metabolites in adverse drug reactions to sulfonamides during HIV infection, whereas alternate mechanism(s) may be responsible for increased rates of adverse drug reactions to clindamycin among patients with AIDS."
3136,0.002,2.0,"Knowledge is limited regarding decision-making about antiretroviral treatment (ART) from the patient's perspective. This substudy of a longitudinal study of psychobiologic aspects of long-term survival, conducted in 2003, compares the rationales of HIV-positive individuals (n = 79) deciding to take or not to take ART. Inclusion criteria were HIV/AIDS symptoms, or CD4 nadir less than 350, or viral load greater than 55,000. Those not meeting any criteria for receiving ART (2/2003 U.S. DHHS treatment guidelines) were excluded. Diagnosis was on average 11 years ago; 36% were female, 42% African American, 28% Latino, 24% white, and 6% other. Qualitative content analysis of semistructured interviews identified 10 criteria for the decision to take or not to take ART: CD4/viral load counts (87%), quality of life (85%), knowledge/ beliefs about resistance (66%), mind-body beliefs (65%), adverse effects of ART (59%), easy-to-take regimen (58%), spirituality/worldview (58%), drug resistance (41%), experience of HIV/AIDS symptoms (39%), and preference for complementary/alternative medicine (17%). Participants choosing not to take ART (27%) preferred complementary/alternative medicine (r = 0.43, p = 0.001)1, perceived a better quality of life without ART (r = 0.32, p < 0.004), and weighted avoidance of adverse effects of ART more heavily (r = 0.24, p < 0.030) than participants taking ART (73%). Demographic characteristics related to taking ART were having a partner (r = 0.31, p < 0.008) and having health insurance (r = 0.26, p< 0.040). Decisions to take or not to take ART depend not only on patient medical characteristics, but also on individual beliefs about ART, complementary/alternative medicine, spirituality, and mind-body connection. HIV-positive individuals declining treatment place more weight on alternative medicine, avoiding adverse effects and perceiving a better quality of life through not taking ART."
7797,0.002,2.0,"A panel of 14 human IgG monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for envelope antigens of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), 2 high-titer human anti-HIV-1 immunoglobulin (HIVIG) preparations, and 15 combinations of MAbs or MAb/HIVIG were tested for their ability to neutralize infection of cultured human T cells (MT-2) with a chimeric simian immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-vpu+), which expressed HIV-1 IIIB envelope antigens. Eleven MAbs and both HIVIGs were neutralizing. When used alone, the anti-CD4-binding site MAb b12, the anti-gp41 MAb 2F5, and the anti-gp120 MAb 2G12 were the most potent. When combination regimens involving two MAbs targeting different epitopes were tested, synergy was seen in all paired MAbs, except for one combination that revealed additive effects. The lowest effective antibody concentration for 50% viral neutralization (EC50) and EC90 were achieved with combinations of MAbs b12, 2F5, 2G12, and the anti-V3 MAb 694/98D. Depending on the combination regimen, the concentration of MAbs required to reach 90% virus neutralization was reduced approximately 2- to 25-fold as compared to the dose requirement of individual MAbs to produce the same effect. Synergy of the combination regimens implies that combinations of antibodies may have a role in passive immunoprophylaxis against HIV-1. The ability of SHIV to replicate in rhesus macaques will allow us to test such approaches in vivo."
6896,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) frequently co-exist due to shared routes of transmission. In the past, the impact of HCV on overall morbidity and mortality of coinfected patients was minimal due to the poor prognosis of HIV. However, since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HCV has become a significant pathogen in this population. HIV clearly exacerbates HCV infection and accelerates progression to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is debate over whether HCV influences the natural history of HIV. Given the high prevalence of coinfection and the accelerated liver damage, HCV treatment has become a priority in these patients. There are new data on pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy for HCV in coinfected patients. The therapy is well tolerated and safe, although it appears to be slightly less effective than in monoinfected patients. The risk of HAART-related hepatotoxicity is greater in coinfected patients and therefore requires special consideration and close monitoring."
4478,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the most prevalent public health problems worldwide, and causes 1 million deaths annually. In Bangladesh, information about prevalence of HBV infection is scarce, and there is no available data on HDV infection. We determined rates of HBsAg and anti-HBc seropositivity in asymptomatic, healthy children (n = 181) and adults (n = 354) presenting to referral facilities in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and tested a separate group of HBsAg-positive patients (n = 180) for prevalence of HDV. Testing of serum was also performed for signs of liver disease. Overall, seropositivity of HBsAg and anti-HBc in studied subjects was 3 per cent (16/534) and 21.1 per cent (113/534), respectively. Prevalence of HBsAg was highest in the 5- to 9-year-old (8.5 per cent, 7/82) and 10- to 14-year-old (5.9 per cent, 2/34) age groups. Unlike HBsAg, prevalence of anti-HBc was lower in children (14.9 per cent in those below the age of 15) than adults (24.4 per cent in those aged 20-34 years) (p < 0.05). Most HBsAg-positive individuals were symptomatic (n = 125, 69.4 per cent). A high rate (24.4 per cent, 44/180) of simultaneous infection with HDV was observed among HBsAg-positive subjects, with higher rates in older individuals. Anti-HDV seropositivity rate was similar among asymptomatic (21.8 per cent, 12/55) and symptomatic (25.6 per cent, 32/125) HBsAg carriers. Our data suggest that Bangladesh is of moderate endemicity for HBV infection, and has relatively high rates of co-infection with HDV. Control HBV and HDV infection in Bangladesh may be best achieved by targeting preschool children, which could fit readily within the existing EPI schedule."

Twenty-four HIV-1-infected subjects received lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg twice daily prior to and during the study: 6 each with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (and hepatitis C virus coinfected) and 12 with normal hepatic function. Mild and moderate hepatic impairment showed similar effects on lopinavir pharmacokinetics. When the 2 hepatic impairment groups were combined, lopinavir Cmax and AUC12 were increased 20% to 30% compared to the controls. Hepatic impairment increased unbound lopinavir AUC12 by 68% and Cmax by 56%. The effect of hepatic impairment on low-dose ritonavir pharmacokinetics was more pronounced in the moderate impairment group (181% and 221% increase in AUC12 and Cmax, respectively) than in the mild impairment group (39% and 61% increase in AUC12 and Cmax, respectively). While lopinavir/ritonavir dose reduction is not recommended in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, caution should be exercised in this population."

Seven of them had lymphoblastic leukaemia and others had solid tumours. Seven cases were male. Mean age was 10.5 years with a range of 5-16 years. Chronic Hepatitis B was diagnosed biochemically, serologically and histopathologically. They were HBsAg(+), HBV-DNA(+), and HCV(-), HIV(-). Seven cases were HBeAg(+) and two of them were anti-Delta IgG(+). Liver biopsy revealed chronic active hepatitis in six cases and persistent hepatitis in three cases. IFN was given at the dose of 5 MU/m2 three times a week, subcutaneously for 6 months. It was well tolerated. After IFN therapy, ALT levels returned to normal in seven cases. All cases were still HBsAg(+). Four of them seroconverted to anti-HBe antibody. Loss of serum HBV-DNA in three cases, but 11 cases showed a marked decrease after IFN. The control liver biopsies showed that histopathological activity index was diminished in five cases. Other 16 patients, serving as control, received no therapy. Five of them were leukaemia and others were solid tumours. Twelve cases were male. Mean age was 9.3 years with a range of 4-19 years. After 6 months, only one patient lost HBV-DNA and three of them seroconverted to anti-HBe with normalization of ALT values. In our study, IFN treatment favourably influenced the progress of chronic hepatitis B in children with cancer."
3696,0.002,2.0,"Children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have T helper cell deficiency, but frequent bacterial infections suggest phagocyte dysfunction. Whole blood chemiluminescence (CL) assays were used to measure the respiratory burst capacity of phagocytes from HIV-infected children, perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected children, and normal healthy children. Phagocytes were stimulated by zymosan opsonized with human complement with and without priming by platelet-activating factor (PAF) or FMLP. Activities of enzymes involved in the respiratory burst, oxidase and myeloperoxidase, were examined after opsonin receptor-independent stimulation with PMA. Unprimed CL responses to opsonized zymosan were decreased for HIV-infected children with severe CD4 lymphocyte suppression compared with healthy children (P=.03), and PAF-primed CL responses to opsonized zymosan were decreased in HIV-infected children with both moderate and severe CD4 lymphocyte suppression (P=.02 and P=.01, respectively), despite normal or increased activities of the respiratory burst enzymes. These impairments may contribute to secondary bacterial infections."
5944,0.002,2.0,We administered a questionnaire pertaining to recent gains in knowledge about HIV/AIDS treatment and natural history in mid-1990 to all physicians and nurses at a 455-bed public teaching hospital. Surveys were returned by 127 physicians (46%) and 541 nurses (77%). Responses indicated that only 37% of physicians and 18% of nurses knew that the risk for an AIDS-related opportunistic infection becomes significant when the T-helper cell count falls below 200 cells per cubic millimeter. One-fourth of physicians (23%) and more than one-half of nurses (55%) were not aware that the HIV enzyme immunoassay test alone is insufficient to properly determine a patient's HIV serostatus. The survey results revealed a broad deficit in knowledge about the natural history and treatment of HIV infection and demonstrated the need for a clinically relevant core HIV/AIDS knowledge curriculum and for strategies to better educate health care providers to improve care given to HIV-infected patients.
7348,0.002,2.0,"Entrenched economic and gender inequities together are driving a globally expanding, increasingly female, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS epidemic. To date, significant population-level declines in HIV transmission have not been observed, at least in part because most approaches to prevention have presumed a degree of individual control in decision making that does not speak to the reality of women's and girls' circumstances in many parts of the world. Such efforts have paid insufficient attention to critical characteristics of the risk environment, most notably poverty and gender power inequities. Even fewer interventions have addressed specific mechanisms through which these inequities engender risky sexual practices that result in women's disproportionately increased vulnerabilities to HIV infection. This article focuses on identifying those mechanisms, or structural pathways, that stem from the interactions between poverty and entrenched gender inequities and recommending strategies to address and potentially modify those pathways. We highlight four such structural pathways to HIV risk, all of which could be transformed: (1) lack of access to critical information and health services for HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention, (2) limited access to formal education and skill development, (3) intimate partner violence, and (4) the negative consequences of migration prompted by insufficient economic resources. We argue for interventions that enhance women's access to education, training, employment, and HIV/STI prevention information and tools; minimize migration; and by working with men and communities, at the same time reduce women's poverty and promote gender-equitable norms. In conclusion, we identify challenges in developing and evaluating strategies to address these structural pathways."
264,0.002,2.0,"We asked whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease plays a major role in the early stages of infection (i.e. from viral entry to reverse transcription) by using various protease inhibitors (saquinavir, ritonavir, and KNI-272). When assessed in the two-day multinuclear activation of a galactosidase indicator (MAGI) assay, involving a single cycle of HIV-1 replication, all protease inhibitors failed to block infection of HeLa-CD4-LTR-beta-gal cells by HIV-1, while reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (AZT and ddI) completely blocked the infection. Moreover, when HIV-1 proviral DNA synthesis was examined by polymerase chain reaction in HeLa-CD4-LTR-beta-gal cells exposed to HIV-1 and cultured in the presence of protease inhibitors, a significant amount of proviral DNA was detected, while no proviral DNA synthesis was detected when the cells were cultured in the presence of RT inhibitors. Protease inhibitors also failed to block chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression in HLCD4-CAT cells exposed to HIV-1, while RT inhibitors completely suppressed CAT expression. These results strongly suggest, contrary to a previous report by Nagy et al. (1994), that HIV-1 protease does not play a major role in the early stages of infection."
8643,0.002,2.0,"Nelfinavir mesylate (formerly AG1343) is a potent and selective, nonpeptidic inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease that was discovered by protein structure-based design methodologies. We evaluated the antiviral and cytotoxic effects of two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the clinically approved antiretroviral therapeutics zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), dideoxycytidine (ddC; zalcitabine), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), indinavir, saquinavir, and ritonavir and a three-drug combination of nelfinavir with ZDV and 3TC against an acute HIV-1 strain RF infection of CEM-SS cells in vitro. Quantitative assessment of drug interaction was evaluated by a universal response surface approach (W. R. Greco, G. Bravo, and J. C. Parsons, Pharm. Rev. 47:331-385, 1995) and by the method of M. N. Prichard and C. Shipman (Antiviral Res. 14:181-206, 1990). Both analytical methods yielded similar results and showed that the two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the reverse transcriptase inhibitors ZDV, 3TC, ddI, d4T, and ddC and the three-drug combination with ZDV and 3TC resulted in additive to statistically significant synergistic interactions. In a similar manner, the combination of nelfinavir with the three protease inhibitors resulted in additive (ritonavir and saquinavir) to slightly antagonistic (indinavir) interactions. In all combinations, minimal cellular cytotoxicity was observed with any drug alone and in combination. These results suggest that administration of combinations of the appropriate doses of nelfinavir with other currently approved antiretroviral therapeutic agents in vivo may result in enhanced antiviral activity with no associated increase in cellular cytotoxicity."
3512,0.002,2.0,"A very small proportion of people remain negative for HIV infection after repeated HIV-1 viral exposure, which is called HIV-1 resistance. Understanding the mechanism of HIV-1 resistance is important for the development of HIV-1 vaccines and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) therapies. In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of CD4+ T cells from HIV-1-resistant individuals and HIV-susceptible individuals. One hundred eighty-five discriminative HIV-1 resistance genes were identified using the Minimum Redundancy-Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) methods. The virus protein target enrichment analysis of the 185 HIV-1 resistance genes suggested that the HIV-1 protein nef might play an important role in HIV-1 infection. Moreover, we identified 29 infection information exchanger genes from the 185 HIV-1 resistance genes based on a virus-host interaction network analysis. The infection information exchanger genes are located on the shortest paths between virus-targeted proteins and are important for the coordination of virus infection. These proteins may be useful targets for AIDS prevention or therapy, as intervention in these pathways could disrupt communication with virus-targeted proteins and HIV-1 infection."
6260,0.002,2.0,"After the transition from the acute to the chronic phase of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, complement mediates long-term storage of virions in germinal centers (GC) of lymphoid tissue. The contribution of particular complement receptors (CRs) to virus trapping in GC was studied on tonsillar specimens from HIV-infected individuals. CR2 (CD21) was identified as the main binding site for HIV in GC. Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) blocking the CR2-C3d interaction were shown to detach 62 to 77% of HIV type 1 from tonsillar cells of an individual in the presymptomatic stage. Although they did so at a lower efficiency, these antibodies were able to remove HIV from tonsillar cells of patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy, suggesting that the C3d-CR2 interaction remains a primary entrapment mechanism in treated patients as well. In contrast, removal of HIV was not observed with MAb blocking CR1 or CR3. Thus, targeting CR2 may facilitate new approaches toward a reduction of residual virus in GC."
7187,0.002,2.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors has led to dramatic decrease in the morbidity and mortality resulting from infection with human immunodeficiency virus-1. However, this combination regimen can be associated with the occurrence of serious toxicities, which may reduce patient compliance. In particular, human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors and nevirapine among nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, have the potential for producing hepatotoxicity. We summarise current knowledge of the hepatotoxic effects associated with the commercially available human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors based on a literature review of the major retrospective and prospective clinical studies designed to elucidate risk factors for developing hepatotoxicity among human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy containing protease inhibitors. Coinfection with chronic hepatitis, a common occurrence in human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients, is identified as an independent risk factor for developing hepatotoxicity in antiretroviral-treated human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients treated with antiretroviral regimens containing protease inhibitors. The importance of other risk factors for developing protease inhibitor-associated hepatotoxicity and the mechanism underlying the drug-related hepatotoxicity are discussed. The data indicate that the potential for producing hepatotoxicity is variable among the protease inhibitors and suggest that based on differences in drug-related hepatotoxicity, certain protease inhibitors may be preferred for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus coinfected patients."

8764,0.002,2.0,"All classes of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy have been associated with asymptomatic elevations of alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) levels, and much less frequently with serious, and at times life threatening, clinical liver hepatotoxicity. The relationship between the risk of developing serious clinical liver injury and the rate and severity of elevated asymptomatic ALT/AST levels is poorly understood. Boehringer Ingelheim has recently completed the Viramune Hepatic Safety Project; its primary objective was to identify risk factors for antiretroviral-associated hepatotoxicity. Data from 1731 nevirapine-treated patients and 1912 control patients who took part in Boehringer Ingelheim-controlled clinical trials as well as 814 nevirapine-treated patients in uncontrolled trials were analyzed. Risk factors for asymptomatic ALT/AST elevations during nevirapine therapy included baseline elevations of ALT/AST levels > 2.5x upper limit of normal (RR = 4.3, p < .01) and co-infection with hepatitis B (RR = 2.3, p < .01) or hepatitis C (RR = 5.2, p < .01). An analysis of ALT/AST elevations > 5x ULN for patients stratified by baseline CD4 cell count demonstrated that men with > or = 400 CD4 cells/mm3 were at increased risk of asymptomatic transaminase elevations while taking nevirapine (RR = 1.6, p < .01). No consistent CD4 cell count cutoff could be identified in women that was associated with an increased risk of ALT/AST elevations. Analyses from five large observational cohorts (N = 8711) demonstrated no significant differences in the rate of serious hepatic events among antiretroviral regimens, including between the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nevirapine and efavirenz. Use of nevirapine was not associated with a significantly increased risk of clinical hepatotoxic events, including liver failure or liver related death, compared to therapy with other antiretroviral drugs."
3646,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) elite controllers (EC) maintain viremia below the limit of commercial assay detection (<50 RNA copies/ml) in the absence of antiviral therapy, but the mechanisms of control remain unclear. HLA-B57 and the closely related allele B*5801 are particularly associated with enhanced control and recognize the same Gag(240-249) TW10 epitope. The typical escape mutation (T242N) within this epitope diminishes viral replication capacity in chronically infected persons; however, little is known about TW10 epitope sequences in residual replicating viruses in B57/B*5801 EC and the extent to which mutations within this epitope may influence steady-state viremia. Here we analyzed TW10 in a total of 50 B57/B*5801-positive subjects (23 EC and 27 viremic subjects). Autologous plasma viral sequences from both EC and viremic subjects frequently harbored the typical cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-selected mutation T242N (15/23 sequences [65.2%] versus 23/27 sequences [85.1%], respectively; P = 0.18). However, other unique mutants were identified in HIV controllers, both within and flanking TW10, that were associated with an even greater reduction in viral replication capacity in vitro. In addition, strong CTL responses to many of these unique TW10 variants were detected by gamma interferon-specific enzyme-linked immunospot assay. These data suggest a dual mechanism for durable control of HIV replication, consisting of viral fitness loss resulting from CTL escape mutations together with strong CD8 T-cell immune responses to the arising variant epitopes."
8481,0.002,2.0,"Behaviors associated with transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were measured in a sample of 60 adults with a severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI). Results revealed that 68% had sex in the last year; 13% of men and 30% of women reported two or more male partners, and 24% of men also reported two or more female partners. Condom use was inconsistent. Sex partners were often met in a psychiatric clinic or bar, and a substantial number were injection drug users or known to be non-monogamous. Overall, 48% of men and 37% of women reported at least one risk factor. Hypothesized psychological antecedents of HIV-related risk behavior were also measured, including knowledge, motivation for risk reduction, and self-efficacy regarding risk-reduction. Many participants were misinformed regarding HIV-transmission and risk reduction. Motivational indices indicated that attitudes toward condoms were slightly positive, and that social norms were generally supportive of condom use. However, participants tended to rate themselves at only slight risk for infection, undermining their motivation for condom use. Participants indicated only modest levels of self-efficacy in situations requiring sexual assertiveness. These findings, coupled with the elevated seroprevalence of HIV among persons having a SPMI, point to the need for risk assessment and counseling by mental health care providers."
2866,0.002,2.0,"To investigate cellular factors involved in HIV-1 chronic infection, three cell lines chronically infected with the same HIV-1 viral isolate (s61) were studied by cDNA microarray analysis. Two T cell lines, H61 and M61, showed the characteristics of a persistent infection whereas U61 cell line displayed a latent infection pattern. Analysis of genes with altered expression in the three cell lines revealed evidence of apoptosis control by up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes. In addition, cell cycle control was affected in the two persistent T cell lines particularly through the down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A/p21). Moreover, each cell line showed specific characteristics, like in M61 cells, genes related with cellular activation and with cell migration and motility. In U61 cells, genes associated with immune response were activated. Genes with altered expression in our experiments, and not previously related with HIV such as ANXA 1 or CFLAR were detected and validated. This work revealed that different cell mechanism such as control of apoptosis and cell cycle are important for ""in vitro"" HIV-1 chronic infections, and discovered new genes previously not related with HIV-1 replication."
9768,0.002,2.0,"Four HHV-6 strains were initially isolated during attempts to observe HIV-1 replication in cultured primary lymphocytes from 48 patients with AIDS. HHV-6 DNA from each strain was extracted from primary cell cultures and amplified using specific primers in a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. All HHV-6 strains were classified as B variants by submitting the PCR products to the digestion of two restriction enzymes (Hind III and Bgl II). Since in primary cultures, the appearance of HHV-6 cytopathic effect was followed by a progressive reduction of HIV-1 replication, we tried to reproduce the observed inhibition in vitro. Two HHV-6 strains, used throughout the experiments, showed their ability to suppress HIV-1 replication when the viruses co-infected CD4+T lymphocyte cultures. While the intrinsic mechanism of this finding still remains unclear, the inhibition of HIV-1 replication was observed only when a high multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of HHV-6 and a low m.o.i. of HIV-1 were used in dually infected cell cultures. By using a semiquantitative determination of HIV-1 cDNA by PCR, it appears that the inhibition begins in infected cell cultures and, once established, does not allow any further HIV-1 replication."
1642,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of AIDS, originated from simian immunodeficiency virus from chimpanzees (SIVcpz), the precursor of the human virus, approximately 100 years ago. This indicates that HIV-1 has emerged through the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees to humans. However, it remains unclear how SIVcpz has evolved into pandemic HIV-1 in humans. To address this question, we inoculated three SIVcpz strains (MB897, EK505, and MT145), four pandemic HIV-1 strains (NL4-3, NLCSFV3, JRCSF, and AD8), and two nonpandemic HIV-1 strains (YBF30 and DJO0131). Humanized mice infected with SIVcpz strain MB897, a virus phylogenetically similar to pandemic HIV-1, exhibited a peak viral load comparable to that of mice infected with pandemic HIV-1, while peak viral loads of mice infected with SIVcpz strain EK505 or MT145 as well as nonpandemic HIV-1 strains were significantly lower. These results suggest that SIVcpz strain MB897 is preadapted to humans, unlike the other SIVcpz strains. Moreover, viral RNA sequencing of MB897-infected humanized mice identified a nonsynonymous mutation in "
6148,0.002,2.0,"Two hundred eleven male street prostitutes between the ages of 18 and 51 years were interviewed and tested for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Economic, social, and emotional barriers to the reduction of HIV-related risk behavior were examined within the context of several concepts present in the Health Belief Model (HBM). Three lifestyle factors were found to function as barriers to engaging in risk reduction behavior. Subjects who were more economically dependent on prostitution, perceived less control over the hustling encounter, and reported increased pleasure from sexual activity with their customers were more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior. Prostitutes' perception of the severity of HIV infection was not significantly associated with their risk behavior. Unexpected findings indicated that increases in perceived susceptibility to HIV and perceived benefit of condom use for HIV prevention were significantly related to increased risk-taking behavior. Practical applications of findings in the design and implementation of future HIV-related preventive health education programs are discussed."
4961,0.002,2.0,"Although vaccines and antiretroviral (ARV) prevention have demonstrated partial success against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in clinical trials, their combined introduction could provide more potent protection. Furthermore, combination approaches could ameliorate the potential increased risk of infection following vaccination in the absence of protective immunity. We used a nonhuman primate model to determine potential interactions of combining a partially effective ARV microbicide with an envelope-based vaccine. The vaccine alone provided no protection from infection following 12 consecutive low-dose intravaginal challenges with simian-HIV strain SF162P3, with more animals infected compared to naive controls. The microbicide alone provided a 68% reduction in the risk of infection relative to that of the vaccine group and a 45% reduction relative to that of naive controls. The vaccine-microbicide combination provided an 88% reduction in the per-exposure risk of infection relative to the vaccine alone and a 79% reduction relative to that of the controls. Protected animals in the vaccine-microbicide group were challenged a further 12 times in the absence of microbicide and demonstrated a 98% reduction in the risk of infection. A total risk reduction of 91% was observed in this group over 24 exposures (P = 0.004). These important findings suggest that combined implementation of new biomedical prevention strategies may provide significant gains in HIV prevention."

Amplification of at least one gene was successful for 144 isolates. All three genes were obtained for 136 isolates. Subtyping showed that CRF01_AE was predominant (130 cases). According to the ANRS September 2004 list, polymorphism substitutions (>50% versus the subtype B consensus) of CRF01_AE at drug resistance positions were observed only in protease: I13V (81%), E35D (87%), M36I (100%), R41K (96%), and H69K (100%). Two strains bore one major resistance mutation to PIs: M46I and N88D. Five other strains carried drug resistance mutations to RTIs: K70R (one strain), V75M (three strains), and K101E (one strain). Of the isolates 4.9% had drug resistance mutations to antiretroviral drugs."
8024,0.002,2.0,"High levels of HIV-1 replication during the chronic phase of infection usually correlate with rapid progression to severe immunodeficiency. However, a minority of highly viremic individuals remains asymptomatic and maintains high CD4⁺ T cell counts. This tolerant profile is poorly understood and reminiscent of the widely studied nonprogressive disease model of SIV infection in natural hosts. Here, we identify transcriptome differences between rapid progressors (RPs) and viremic nonprogressors (VNPs) and highlight several genes relevant for the understanding of HIV-1-induced immunosuppression. RPs were characterized by a specific transcriptome profile of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells similar to that observed in pathogenic SIV-infected rhesus macaques. In contrast, VNPs exhibited lower expression of interferon-stimulated genes and shared a common gene regulation profile with nonpathogenic SIV-infected sooty mangabeys. A short list of genes associated with VNP, including CASP1, CD38, LAG3, TNFSF13B, SOCS1, and EEF1D, showed significant correlation with time to disease progression when evaluated in an independent set of CD4⁺ T cell expression data. This work characterizes 2 minimally studied clinical patterns of progression to AIDS, whose analysis may inform our understanding of HIV pathogenesis."

The IDU population increased 70% from 2000 to 2004 and is disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS -- the country's second leading cause of death. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) share transmission routes with HIV and cause serious medical consequences. This study aimed to determine risk factors for acquisition of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections among IDUs in a northern province. We conducted a matched case-control study among active IDUs aged 18-45 who participated in a community-based survey (30-minute interview and serologic testing). Each HIV-infected IDU (case) was matched with one HIV-uninfected IDU (control) by age, sex (males only), and study site (128 pairs). Similar procedures were used for HBV infection (50 pairs) and HCV infection (65 pairs). Conditional logistic regression models were fit to identify risk factors for each infection. Among 309 surveyed IDUs, the HIV, HBV, and HCV prevalence was 42.4%, 80.9%, and 74.1%, respectively. Only 11.0% reported having been vaccinated against hepatitis B. While 13.3% of the IDUs reported sharing needles (past six months), 63.8% engaged in indirect sharing practices (past six months), including sharing drug solutions, containers, rinse water, and frontloading drugs. In multivariable models, sharing drugs through frontloading was significantly associated with HIV infection (odds ratio [OR]=2.8), HBV infection (OR=3.8), and HCV infection (OR=4.6). We report an unrecognized association between sharing drugs through frontloading and higher rates of HIV, HBV and HCV infections among male IDUs in Vietnam. This finding may have important implications for bloodborne viral prevention for IDUs in Vietnam."

The aim of this study is to measure the risk of having adverse neonatal outcomes: preterm delivery (<37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (<2500 g at birth), and preterm and low-birth-weight baby (<37 weeks of gestation and <2500 g at birth) associated with the presence of periodontitis in HIV-infected women."
117,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral drug resistance mutations prevent successful outcome of treatment and lead to worsening of liver disease. Detection of its emergence permits opportune treatment with alternative drugs. Unfortunately, the use of newly approved antivirals, including adefovir dipivoxil, emtricitabine, and telbivudine, is also associated with the development of drug resistance, albeit to a lesser extent than the use of lamivudine. The objectives of this work were to assess the performance characteristics (sensitivity and accuracy) of an updated drug resistance test, the INNO-LiPA HBV DR v2, which includes detection of mutations associated with lamivudine, adefovir, emtricitabine, and telbivudine resistance, and to compare the results with consensus sequencing of serum samples from patients treated with HBV antivirals. Diagnostic sensitivity, defined as detection of a positive amplification line on the line probe assay (LiPA) strip, was 94.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.7 to 97.9) after initial testing, increasing to 96.3% (95% CI, 91.6 to 98.8) after repeat test 1 and to 100% (95% CI, 97.3 to 100.0) after repeat test 2. In diagnostic accuracy determinations, full concordance was observed between sequencing and LiPA for 77.0% of the codons tested (620/805 codons [95% CI, 74.0 to 79.9]), whereas LiPA and sequencing were partially concordant 22% of the time (177/805 codons). In 167 out of 177 cases, LiPA detected a wild-type/mutant mixture whereas sequencing detected only one of the two results. Performance testing of the new LiPA test, the INNO-LiPA HBV DR v2, showed convincing diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy. The ability of the test to detect mixed infections and minority viral populations associated with resistance to the current generation of antivirals, including adefovir, emtricitabine, and telbivudine, makes it a useful tool for HBV therapy monitoring."

1048,0.002,2.0,"Extracorporeal photochemotherapy (photopheresis), an immunomodulatory therapy that targets circulating T helper lymphocytes, has been applied to the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Any therapy that exerts its actions on CD4+ T cells has the potential of exacerbating HIV infection. Therefore, it was necessary to observe immune function during treatment. Because cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural-killer cells are thought to play an important role in the response against HIV infection, we examined the effect of photopheresis on HIV cytolytic activity. The study group consisted of seven patients with late-stage HIV disease who had not received any previous treatment for HIV infection. Patients were treated exclusively with photopheresis on two consecutive days each month for 14-32 months (average, 25 months). Peripheral lymphocytes, collected at various points during treatment, were used as effectors in a 51Cr release assay. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed autologous B cell lines transfected with recombinant vaccinia vectors that expressed the HIV env (gp120, gp41) and gag (p24) proteins were used as target cells. All seven patients demonstrated relatively constant levels of cytolysis (>10% above controls) during treatment in the context of stable CD4+ T cell counts and a stable clinical status. These results suggest that extracorporeal photochemotherapy did not impair the cytolytic response to HIV infection and may have enhanced it in some patients."

Lesions less commonly recorded include oral ulceration (2.9%) and Kaposi's sarcoma (1.5%). The clinical range of lesions seen is similar to those reported elsewhere, but socio-cultural differences allowed no reliable comparison. More than a quarter of our patients had oral soft tissue discomfort necessitating treatment; in 3.3% these were the presenting symptom.

2836,0.002,2.0,"The use of rapid tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has become standard in HIV testing algorithms employed in resource-limited settings. We report an extensive HIV rapid test validation study conducted among Ugandan blood bank donors at low risk for HIV infection. The operational characteristics of four readily available commercial HIV rapid test kits were first determined with 940 donor samples and were used to select a serial testing algorithm. Uni-Gold Recombigen HIV was used as the screening test, followed by HIV-1/2 STAT-PAK for reactive samples. OraQuick HIV-1 testing was performed if the first two test results were discordant. This algorithm was then tested with 5,252 blood donor samples, and the results were compared to those of enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and Western blotting. The unadjusted algorithm sensitivity and specificity were 98.6 and 99.9%, respectively. The adjusted sensitivity and specificity were 100 and 99.96%, respectively. This HIV testing algorithm is a suitable alternative to EIAs and Western blotting for Ugandan blood donors."
6303,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency type 1 isolates from 18 initially symptom-free men who were treated with zidovudine for 2 years were investigated for drug sensitivity. At the start all the men had persistent core antigenaemia; the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome developed in 6 during the study. The polymerase chain reaction was used to detect mutations at residue 215 of reverse transcriptase, a mutation associated with reduced drug sensitivity. After 2 years 16/18 isolates were mutant. However, after about 6 months of treatment the mutation was detected in only 7 isolates, 4 from individuals who subsequently had AIDS. Limited direct virus sensitivity data correlated with the genetic data. The rate of appearance of the 215 mutation seemed to correlate with CD4 counts and viral virulence."
7876,0.002,2.0,"A distinct clinical syndrome of cholestasis and hepatitis occurred during early infancy in seven infants with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection. In five infants hepatitis was the first manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection. The median age of onset of hepatitis was 7 months (range, 5 to 10 months). The mean total bilirubin concentration at presentation was 7.4 mg/dl (range, 3.9 to 11 mg/dl), the mean aspartate aminotransferase was 1512 IU/liter (range, 782 to 2960 IU/liter) and the mean alanine amino-transferase 512 IU/liter (range, 92 to 1247 IU/liter). The absolute CD4 count at the time of onset of hepatitis ranged from 191 to 2298 cells/mm3 (mean, 766 cells/mm3). Six of the seven children died within 12 weeks of onset of hepatitis, three as a result of complications of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and two died of complications secondary to cytomegalovirus. In only one infant was the cause of death the direct consequence of liver failure. The seventh infant died 17 months after the onset of hepatitis of dilated cardiomyopathy. No specific etiologic agent has been identified as the cause of cholestatic hepatitis in these infants. In situ hybridization studies to detect human immunodeficiency virus 1 messenger RNA was negative in the liver tissue obtained at biopsy and autopsy in five of the samples tested."
9409,0.002,2.0,"Ribavirin was administered orally in escalating doses for 2 or 4 weeks to 15 symptom-free, human immunodeficiency virus seropositive homosexual men with generalized lymphadenopathy. Reverse transcriptase activity was inhibited during therapy when steady-state plasma concentrations were greater than 6 mumol/L. These concentrations were achieved with 1200 or 2400 mg/day for 2 weeks or a loading dose of 2400 mg/day for 3 days followed by 600 mg/day for 4 weeks. Drug accumulation occurred at all doses. The elimination half-life appeared to be approximately 2 weeks. Reversible adverse reactions, principally resulting in central nervous system symptoms and anemia, correlated with dose and duration of therapy. Immunologic enhancement of T-lymphocyte-mediated mitogen-induced responses was observed in the majority of patients who had reduction in reverse transcriptase activity. However, specific T4+ lymphocyte-mediated antigen-induced responses increased to within the normal range in only three patients. Significant enhancement appeared to correlate with the severity of baseline antigen-induced functional impairment. These data indicate that oral ribavirin can be given for at least 1 month with acceptable toxicity at doses that appear to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus replication."
7328,0.002,2.0,"Injecting drug users (IDU) in Bangladesh are at the early stages of an HIV epidemic. To understand the dynamics of the HIV epidemic, male IDU (n = 561) were recruited from the needle/syringe exchange program in Dhaka in 2002, who underwent a risk-behavior survey and were tested for HIV, syphilis, hepatitis C, and hepatitis B. Correlates of HIV infection were determined by conducting bivariate and multiple regression analyses. The median age of the IDU was 35 years, 39.6% had no formal education, approximately half were married and/or living with their regular sex partner and 26% were currently homeless. The median age at first injection was 29 years. HIV was detected in 5.9% of the IDU and homelessness was the only factor independently associated with HIV (OR = 5.5). Urgent measures must be undertaken to prevent escalation of the HIV epidemic. The study's limitations are noted."
975,0.002,2.0,"Tuberculosis, once on the steady decline in the western world, has resurfaced with renewed vigor in the wake of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. People with HIV infection are both more likely to contract primary tuberculosis and at greater risk for reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Tuberculous disease may present with atypical signs and symptoms in HIV-infected hosts because of alterations in the immune system. Superimposed on the virulent interaction of HIV and tuberculosis is the emerging problem of multidrug resistant strains that often resist currently available therapies. HIV-positive health professionals working in high-risk environments pose a special problem, while populations unable to comply with currently available pharmacological therapies pose another. We have many tools available to combat the resurgence of tuberculosis, but new methods of diagnosis and new approaches to treatment are sorely needed."
1686,0.002,2.0,"To examine trends in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) mortality in the United States, we analyzed PML death rates and deaths for 1979 through 1994, using US multiple cause-of-death data. During the 16-year study period 3,894 PML deaths were reported. The age-adjusted death rate increased more than 20-fold, from less than 0.2 per million persons before 1984 to 3.3 per million persons in 1994. The increase was attributable to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which was recorded on 2,267 (89.0%) of 2.546 death records from 1991 through 1994. PML age-adjusted death rates increased abruptly for all males beginning in 1984 and for black females in 1990. Only a small increase was observed for white females. In 1994, PML was reported in 2.1% of white males who died with HIV-associated disease compared with 1.2% of white females and 1.0% of black males and females who died of similar causes. The epidemic of PML deaths is increasing in parallel with the AIDS epidemic. The increase in HIV-associated PML deaths, first noted among males, has also become apparent among females and probably reflects the increasing importance of drug use and heterosexual transmission of HIV. The reason for the higher prevalence of PML among white males with HIV infection is unknown."
4423,0.002,2.0,"These recommendations were developed by the U.S. Public Health Service to address the increasing epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among women and their infants. The recommendations stress the importance of early diagnosis of HIV infection for the health of both women and their infants and are based on advances made in HIV-related treatment and prevention. The most significant advance for this population has been the results from a placebo-controlled, clinical trial that indicated that administration of zidovudine to HIV-infected pregnant women and their newborns reduced the risk for perinatal transmission of HIV by approximately two thirds (1). This document recommends routine HIV counseling and voluntary testing for all pregnant women and is intended to serve as guidance for health-care providers in educating women about the importance of knowing their HIV infection status. For uninfected women, such HIV counseling and testing programs can provide information that can reduce their risk for acquiring HIV; for women who have HIV infection, these programs can enable them to receive appropriate and timely medical interventions for their own health and for reducing the risk for perinatal (i.e., mother to infant) and other modes of HIV transmission. These programs also can facilitate appropriate follow-up care and services for HIV-infected women, their infants, and other family members."
9195,0.002,2.0,"A total of 351 determinations of sexual hormones were carried out in 189 HIV-infected men in stable clinical condition. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was associated with increased levels of both testosterone and 17beta-estradiol, but not with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Protease inhibitors were more associated with testosterone, and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors with 17beta-estradiol. The values of both hormones, but not those of LH and FSH, increased with respect to pre-treatment levels in those patients who initiated HAART."
2143,0.002,2.0,The underlying mechanism of HBsAg-negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is notoriously difficult to elucidate because of the extremely low DNA levels which define the condition. We used a highly efficient amplification method to overcome this obstacle and achieved our aim which was to identify specific mutations or sequence variations associated with this entity.
3506,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the health setting is a global public health problem. The risk of occupational exposure to HBV among health care workers is a major concern, especially among students in health professions. In Ethiopia, very little is known about the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) of trainees in the health professions towards occupational risk of HBV. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the level of KAP of medicine and health Sciences students in Northwest Ethiopia towards occupational risk of HBV infection."
4411,0.002,2.0,"The envelope protein (Env) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 forms homo-oligomers in the endoplasmic reticulum. The oligomeric structure of Env is maintained after cleavage in a Golgi compartment and transport to the surfaces of infected cells, where incorporation into budding virions takes place. Here, we use biophysical techniques to assess the oligomeric valency of virion-associated Env prior to fusion activation. Virion-associated Env oligomers were stabilized by chemical cross-linking prior to detergent extraction and were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. Gel filtration revealed a single predominant oligomeric species, and sedimentation equilibrium analysis-derived mass values indicated a trimeric structure. Determination of the masses of individual Env molecules by scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that virion-associated Env was trimeric, and a triangular morphology was observed in 20 to 30% of the molecules. These results, which firmly establish the oligomeric structure of human immunodeficiency virus virion-associated Env, parallel those of our previous analysis of the simian immunodeficiency virus Env."
2844,0.002,2.0,"This article examines associations between self-perceptions of pain and associated pain distress to gender, ethnicity and religion, health care, health status, and emotional distress. Data were collected through interviews collected in participants' homes. Participants were 151 adults with diagnoses of advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Time since diagnosis, health status, health care, ethnicity, gender, religion, and emotional distress were examined as mediators of pain symptoms, pain distress, and anticipatory pain. Almost all participants (83%) reported AIDS-related pain in the last 3 months. Unexpectedly, pain was negatively associated with time since diagnosis with AIDS. Pain symptoms and pain distress tended to vary by ethnicity, with Latinos expressing more symptoms and pain distress than African Americans. Anticipatory pain varied significantly by gender and religion, with women, Catholics, and Protestants anticipating pain more than men and non-Christians. Anxiety, depression, and general emotional distress were significantly associated with pain symptoms (r = 0.44, 0.33, 0.47) and pain distress (r = 0.34, 0.31, 0.34). Health status and health care were unrelated to pain symptoms, pain distress, or anticipatory pain. Pain is a common problem for people living with HIV/AIDS. Self-reported pain is associated with cultural factors and changes in illness status. Clinicians' attention to patients' emotional distress, depression, and anxiety may assist in interventions for pain management."
9540,0.002,2.0,"Evidence of increasing prevalence of drug resistance among recent HIV seroconverters indicates a growing public health concern and warrants an examination of the problem from a prevention perspective. Among 638 HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) completing 2731 visits between December 1996 and February 2000 in an ongoing cohort study in Baltimore, Maryland, factors associated with unprotected sex and needle sharing were determined. Participants were classified as being at higher or lower risk of HIV and of drug-resistant HIV transmission based on viral load, antiretroviral therapy use, and reported high-risk behavior. Stored plasma of those at higher risk of drug-resistant HIV transmission was tested for resistance by VirtualPhenotype (Vircolab, Rockville, MD). Women were nearly twice as likely as men to engage in unprotected sex, and IDUs were more likely to have unprotected sex if their sexual partners were also HIV infected. IDUs were at higher risk of HIV and drug-resistant HIV transmission at 19% and 6% of all visits, respectively. Participants were infected with drug-resistant HIV at 14% of visits when they were at higher risk of HIV transmission. Intensive risk reduction counseling is needed and must be integrated into routine HIV clinical care."
4421,0.002,2.0,"It is estimated that approximately 3% of the world population are chronically infected with HCV, as the annual incidence of HCV infection is approximately 3-4 million people. Despite all efforts made to eradicate the HCV infection, after the standard therapy (PegIFN and ribavirin for 48 weeks) only 40-50% of the HCV infected individuals with genotype 1 achieve sustained virological response (SVR). Since our goal today is the eradication of HCV infection, our prior concern has become the identification of predictor factors concerning treatment response. Recent studies such as GWAS have been concerned with the genetic factors and the response to treatment. Recently all interest has been turned towards the demonstration of the host polymorphism located upstream of the IL-28B gene and which is associated with sustained virological response to treatment with pegylated interferon Alfa in combination with ribavirin. Although 2011 comes with the FDA approval of the new triple therapy associating telaprevir/ boceprevir to the standard therapy, a new ethical concern regarding the high costs of this treatment rises the problem of who is the first in line? This is just the beginning of a new quest to further investigate the relationship between the host's polymorphism of the IL-28 gene and the standard and triple therapy in HCV infected individuals in achieving SVR as well as who should receive standard or triple therapy. Determination of the IL-28 polymorphisms may be used together with clinical assessment in order to evaluate patients and to personalize their treatment. The purpose of this paper is to underline the main concerns regarding the goal and endpoints of the HCV therapy, and the relationship of IL-28 in achieving sustained virological response, as well as in pointing out the importance to determine prior to initiating treatment the polymorphism of IL-28 since it is a strong predictor. This is important because it will increase the chances to achieve SVR, it will be cost-effective and reduces adverse effects."
6657,0.002,2.0,"Sub-Saharan Africa is disproportionately burdened by intestinal helminth and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. Recent evidence suggests detrimental immunologic effects from concomitant infection with the two pathogens. Few studies, however, have assessed the prevalence of and predictors for intestinal helminth infection among HIV-1-infected adults in urban African settings where HIV infection rates are highest. We collected and analyzed sociodemographic and parasitologic data from 297 HIV-1-infected adults (mean age = 31.1 years, 69% female) living in Lusaka, Zambia to assess the prevalence and associated predictors of helminth infection. We found at least one type of intestinal helminth in 24.9% of HIV-infected adults. Thirty-nine (52.7%) were infected with Ascaris lumbricoides, and 29 (39.2%) were infected with hookworm. More than 80% were light-intensity infections. A recent visit to a rural area, food shortage, and prior history of helminth infection were significant predictors of current helminth status. The high helminth prevalence and potential for adverse interactions between helminths and HIV suggests that helminth diagnosis and treatment should be part of routine HIV care."
9789,0.002,2.0,"Over 65% of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reside in sub-Saharan Africa, and thus efforts to change the course of the HIV-1 pandemic should focus on this geographic region. Here, we discuss factors, including sexually transmitted diseases and hormonal contraceptive use, that impact susceptibility to HIV-1 in women in sub-Saharan Africa. This population is of special interest, given that women in this region are more likely to be infected than men. In addition, they are a potential source of transmission to their infants. A better understanding of the factors that influence HIV-1 susceptibility is key to developing interventions to control the epidemic."
7037,0.002,2.0,"Mutations in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, previously shown to confer an enhanced replicative capacity and broadened host range to the ELI1 strain of HIV-1, were analyzed for their biochemical effects on envelope structure and function. The tendency of purified virions to release their extracellular gp120 component, either spontaneously or after interacting with soluble CD4 (CD4-induced shedding) was assessed. A single amino acid substitution in part of the CD4 binding site of gp120 (Gly-427 to Arg) enhanced both spontaneous and CD4-induced shedding of gp120 from virions, while a single change in the fusogenic region of gp41 (Met-7 to Val) affected only CD4-induced shedding. Although each codon change alone conferred increased growth ability, virus with both mutations exhibited the most rapid replication kinetics. In addition, when both of these mutations were present, virions had the highest tendency to shed gp120, both spontaneously and after exposure to soluble CD4. Analysis of CD4 binding to virion-associated gp120 showed that the changes in both gp120 and gp41 contributed to increased binding. These results demonstrated that the increased replicative capacity of the ELI variants in human CD4+ cell lines was associated with altered physical and functional properties of the virion envelope glycoproteins."
5454,0.002,2.0,"In the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, the incidence of non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADC) has increased and contributes to a growing proportion of mortality in the aging HIV-infected population. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of increased cancer risk are incompletely understood. Potential contributors include oncogenic effects of the HIV virus, immunosuppression, chronic inflammation and immune activation, exposure to HAART, higher rates of oncogenic viral coinfections and traditional cancer risk factors. HIV-infected patients often present with NADC at younger ages with more aggressive or advanced stage disease. However, when standard cancer therapy is given, treatment outcomes appear similar to the non-HIV population. These facts highlight the importance of clinicians' maintaining a high index of suspicion, performing age-appropriate screening, and optimizing cancer therapy. Development of novel strategies for screening, prevention, and treatment of NADC will be required to reverse these epidemiologic trends and improve the survival of HIV-infected patients. "
