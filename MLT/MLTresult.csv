Doc No.1,14248,positive/labeled,56.309353,"Effects of testosterone replacement with a nongenital, transdermal system, Androderm, in human immunodeficiency virus-infected men with low testosterone levels.","Although weight loss associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is multifactorial in its pathogenesis, it has been speculated that hypogonadism, a common occurrence in HIV disease, contributes to depletion of lean tissue and muscle dysfunction. We, therefore, examined the effects of testosterone replacement by means of Androderm, a permeation-enhanced, nongenital transdermal system, on lean body mass, body weight, muscle strength, health-related quality of life, and HIV-disease markers. We randomly assigned 41 HIV-infected, ambulatory men, 18-60 yr of age, with serum testosterone levels below 400 ng/dL, to 1 of 2 treatment groups: group I, two placebo patches (n = 21); or group II, two testosterone patches designed to release 5 mg testosterone over 24 h. Eighteen men in the placebo group and 14 men in the testosterone group completed the 12-week treatment. Serum total and free testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels increased, and LH and FSH levels decreased in the testosterone-treated, but not in the placebo-treated, men. Lean body mass and fat-free mass, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, increased significantly in men receiving testosterone patches [change in lean body mass, +1.345 +/- 0.533 kg (P = 0.02 compared to no change); change in fat-free mass, +1.364 +/- 0.525 kg (P = 0.02 compared to no change)], but did not change in the placebo group [change in lean body mass, 0.189 +/- 0.470 kg (P = NS compared to no change); change in fat-free mass, 0.186 +/- 0.470 kg (P = NS compared to no change)]. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 treatment groups in the change in lean body mass. The change in lean body mass during treatment was moderately correlated with the increment in serum testosterone levels (r = 0.41; P = 0.02). The testosterone-treated men experienced a greater decrease in fat mass than those receiving placebo patches (P = 0.04). There was no significant change in body weight in either treatment group. Changes in overall quality of life scores did not correlate with testosterone treatment; however, in the subcategory of role limitation due to emotional problems, the men in the testosterone group improved an average of 43 points of a 0-100 possible score, whereas those in the placebo group did not change. Red cell count increased in the testosterone group (change in red cell count, +0.1 +/- 0.1 10(12)/L) but decreased in the placebo group (change in red cell count, -0.2 +/- 0.1 10(12)/L). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and plasma HIV copy number did not significantly change during treatment. Serum prostate-specific antigen and plasma lipid levels did not change in either treatment group. Testosterone replacement in HIV-infected men with low testosterone levels is safe and is associated with a 1.35-kg gain in lean body mass, a significantly greater reduction in fat mass than that achieved with placebo treatment, an increased red cell count, and an improvement in role limitation due to emotional problems. Further studies are needed to assess whether testosterone supplementation can produce clinically meaningful changes in muscle function and disease outcome in HIV-infected men."
Doc No.2,1399,negative/unlabeled,39.41706,"Fasting hyperinsulinemia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected men: relationship to body composition, gonadal function, and protease inhibitor use.","Fat redistribution in the setting of protease inhibitor use is increasingly common and is associated with insulin resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. However, little is known regarding the factors that may contribute to abnormal insulin regulation in this population. We assessed fasting insulin levels in HIV-infected men and determined the relationship among insulin, body composition, endogenous gonadal steroid concentrations, and antiviral therapy in this population. We also determined the effects of exogenous testosterone administration using the homeostatic model for insulin resistance (HOMA IR) in hypogonadal HIV-infected men with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome wasting syndrome. Fifty HIV-infected men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome wasting were compared with 20 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy control subjects. Insulin concentrations were significantly increased in HIV-infected patients compared to those in control patients (16.6+/-1.8 vs. 10.4+/-0.8 microU/mL; P<0.05) and were increased in nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTI)-treated patients who did not receive a protease inhibitor (PI; 21.7+/-4.3 vs. 10.4+/-0.8 microU/mL; P<0.05). Insulin concentrations and HOMA IR were inversely correlated with the serum free testosterone concentration (r = -0.36; P = 0.01 for insulin level; r = -0.30; P = 0.03 for HOMA), but not to body composition parameters, age, or BMI. In a multivariate regression analysis, free testosterone (P = 0.05), BMI (P<0.01), and lean body mass (P = 0.04) were significant. Lower lean body mass and higher BMI predicted increased insulin resistance. The HIV-infected patients demonstrated an increased trunk fat to total fat ratio (0.49+/-0.02 vs. 0.45+/-0.02; P<0.05) and an increased trunk fat to extremity fat ratio (1.27+/-0.09 vs. 0.95+/-0.06, P = 0.01), but a reduced extremity fat to total fat ratio (0.44+/-0.01 vs. 0.49 + 0.01; P = 0.02) and reduced overall total body fat (13.8+/-0.7 vs. 17.2+/-0.9 kg; P<0.01) compared to the control subjects. Increased truncal fat and reduced extremity fat were seen among NRTI-treated patients, but this pattern was most severe among patients receiving combined NRTI and PI therapy [trunk fat to extremity ratio, 1.47+/-0.15 vs. 0.95+/-0.06 (P<0.01); extremity fat to total fat ratio, 0.40+/-0.02 vs. 0.49+/-0.01 (P<0.05)]. Insulin responses to testosterone administration were investigated among 52 HIV-infected men with hypogonadism and wasting (weight <90% ideal body weight and/or weight loss >10%) randomized to either testosterone (300 mg, im, every 3 weeks) or placebo for 6 months. Testosterone administration reduced HOMA IR in the HIV-infected men (-0.6+/-0.7 vs. +1.41+/-0.8, testosterone vs. placebo, P = 0.05) in association with increased lean body mass (P = 0.02). These data demonstrate significant hyperinsulinemia in HIV-infected patients, which can occur in the absence of PI use. In NRTI-treated patients not receiving PI, a precursor phenotype is apparent, with increased truncal fat, reduced extremity fat, and increased insulin concentrations. This phenotype is exaggerated in patients receiving PI therapy, with further increased truncal fat and reduced extremity fat, although hyperinsulinemia per se is not worse. Endogenous gonadal steroid levels are inversely related to hyperinsulinemia in HIV-infected men, but reduced lean body mass and increased weight are the primary independent predictors of hyperinsulinemia. Indexes of insulin sensitivity improve in response to physiological androgen administration among hypogonadal HIV-infected patients, and this change is again related primarily to increased lean body mass in response to testosterone administration."
Doc No.3,1953,positive/labeled,38.85874,Soluble levels of receptor for advanced glycation endproducts and dysfunctional high-density lipoprotein in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus: ACTG NWCS332.,"The role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) function and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in HIV-related atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unclear. Both glycation and oxidation (HDLox) are major modifications of HDL that can alter its composition and function. Therefore, we explored the longitudinal association of HDLox with progression of glycation, as evaluated by measurement of circulating forms of receptor for AGE that predict morbidity (soluble Receptors for Advanced Glycation Endproducts [sRAGE], endogenous secretory Receptors for Advanced Glycation Endproducts [esRAGE]), in people with HIV-1 (PWH; HIV-1) and uninfected (HIV-1) individuals.We retrospectively assessed if levels of plasma sRAGE and esRAGE and HDL function (reduced antioxidant function is associated with increased HDL lipid hydroperoxide content; HDLox) in a subset of participants (n = 80) from a prospective 3-year study (AIDS Clinical Trials Group A5078). Primary outcomes were baseline and yearly rates of change over 96 of 144 weeks (Δ) in HDLox in HIV-1 versus uninfected HIV-1 controls (noted as HIV-1).Higher baseline levels of sRAGE in PWH on effective anti-retroviral therapy and with low CVD risk, but not in HIV-1 persons, were independently associated with higher HDLox. EsRAGE, but not sRAGE, had consistent inverse relationships with ΔHDLox in both HIV-1 and HIV-1 persons at baseline. In HIV-1 but not in HIV-1 persons, ΔHDLox had positive and inverse relationships with ΔRAGE and ΔesRAGE, respectively.Glycation and oxidation of HDL may contribute to impaired HDL function present in PWH."
Doc No.4,4498,negative/unlabeled,35.369545,Can androgen therapy replete lean body mass and improve muscle function in wasting associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection?,"A significant number of men who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have low testosterone levels. Androgen deficiency in HIV-infected patients is associated with decreased muscle mass and function, and adverse disease outcome. Administration of replacement doses of testosterone to healthy hypogonadal men augments lean body mass, muscle size, and maximal voluntary strength. Recent studies have shown that physiologic testosterone replacement in HIV-infected men with weight loss who have low testosterone levels can also increase muscle mass and effort-dependent strength. However, further studies are needed to determine whether androgen therapy can improve physical function and health-related outcomes in HIV-infected men."
Doc No.5,9658,negative/unlabeled,31.503817,The effects of an ActRIIb receptor Fc fusion protein ligand trap in juvenile simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus macaques.,"There are no approved therapies for muscle wasting in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which portends poor disease outcomes. To determine whether a soluble ActRIIb receptor Fc fusion protein (ActRIIB.Fc), a ligand trap for TGF-β/activin family members including myostatin, can prevent or restore loss of lean body mass and body weight in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected juvenile rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Fourteen pair-housed, juvenile male rhesus macaques were inoculated with SIVmac239 and, 4 wk postinoculation (WPI) treated with intramuscular injections of 10 mg ⋅ kg(-1) ⋅ wk(-1) ActRIIB.Fc or saline placebo. Body weight, lean body mass, SIV titers, and somatometric measurements were assessed monthly for 16 wk. Age-matched SIV-infected rhesus macaques were injected with saline. Intervention groups did not differ at baseline. Gains in lean mass were significantly greater in the ActRIIB.Fc group than in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Administration of ActRIIB.Fc was associated with greater gains in body weight (P = 0.01) and upper arm circumference than placebo. Serum CD4(+) T-lymphocyte counts and SIV copy numbers did not differ between groups. Administration of ActRIIB.Fc was associated with higher muscle expression of myostatin than placebo. ActRIIB.Fc effectively blocked and reversed loss of body weight, lean mass, and fat mass in juvenile SIV-infected rhesus macaques."
Doc No.6,17148,negative/unlabeled,29.289692,Prevalence of hypogonadism among men with weight loss related to human immunodeficiency virus infection who were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy.,"Previous studies have indicated that there is a significant prevalence (50%) of hypogonadism among men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated wasting, and for these patients testosterone administration has been shown to increase lean body mass and improve quality of life. However, the prevalence of hypogonadism is not known among men with weight loss related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). From 1997 through 1999, we investigated total and free testosterone levels in 90 men who were <90% of ideal body weight or had weight loss of >10% from preillness weight; 71% of these subjects were receiving HAART. Twenty-one percent of the subjects receiving HAART had low free testosterone levels. No correlation was seen between weight, CD4 cell count, medication status, and other clinical factors. These data suggest that hypogonadism remains relatively common in men with AIDS wasting, despite treatment with HAART. HIV-infected men with wasting syndrome should be screened for hypogonadism and receive physiological androgen replacement therapy if they are hypogonadal."
Doc No.7,6561,negative/unlabeled,26.243504,Effects of pharmacological doses of nandrolone decanoate and progressive resistance training in immunodeficient patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.,"This nonplacebo-controlled, open label, randomized study was conducted to test the hypotheses that pharmacological doses of nandrolone decanoate would increase lean body tissue, muscle mass, and strength in immunodeficient human immunodeficiency virus-infected men, and that these effects would be enhanced with progressive resistance training (PRT). Thirty human immunodeficiency virus-positive men with fewer than 400 CD4 lymphocytes/mm3 were randomly assigned to receive weekly injections of nandrolone alone or in combination with supervised PRT at 80% of the one-repetition maximum three times weekly for 12 weeks. Total body weight increased significantly in both groups (3.2 +/- 2.7 and 4.0 +/- 2.0 kg, respectively; P < 0.001), with increases due primarily to augmentation of lean tissue. Lean body mass determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry increased significantly more in the PRT group (3.9 +/- 2.3 vs. 5.2 +/- 5.7 kg, respectively; P = 0.03). Body cell mass by bioelectrical impedance analysis increased significantly (P < 0.001) in both groups (2.6 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.8 kg), but to a similar magnitude (P = NS). Significant increases in cross-sectional area by magnetic resonance imaging of total thigh muscles (1538 +/- 767 and 1480 +/- 532 mm2), quadriceps (705 +/- 365 and 717 +/- 288 mm2), and hamstrings (842 +/- 409 and 771 +/- 295 mm2) occurred with both treatment strategies (P < 0.001 for the three muscle areas); these increases were similar in both groups (P = NS). By the one-repetition method, strength increased in both upper and lower body exercises, with gains ranging from 10.3-31% in the nandrolone group and from 14.4-53.0% in the PRT group (P < 0.006 with one exception). Gains in strength were of significantly greater magnitude in the PRT group (P < or = 0.005 for all comparisons), even after correction for lean body mass. Thus, pharmacological doses of nandrolone decanoate yielded significant gains in total weight, lean body mass, body cell mass, muscle size, and strength. The increases in lean body mass and muscular strength were significantly augmented with PRT."
Doc No.8,7476,positive/labeled,23.153399,The use of a transscrotal testosterone delivery system in the treatment of patients with weight loss related to human immunodeficiency virus infection.,Weight loss is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) lose body cell mass. Hypogonadism is also common. This study tested the efficacy of a testosterone transscrotal patch (6 mg/day) in improving body cell mass and treating hypogonadism in these patients.
Doc No.9,11609,negative/unlabeled,23.123142,Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and Male Hypogonadism: A Review.,"Hypogonadism is a common complication among HIV infected patients. The prevalence of hypogonadism is 30 to 50% in HIV infected men with wasting syndrome and 20 to 25% in those without wasting syndrome. HIV infection affects the entire hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis via both direct and indirect effects, which are defined in four categories, 1) direct effect of HIV particles, 2) opportunistic infections, 3) HIV-related malignancy and its treatment, and 4) medications that are used for HIV infection or its opportunistic infection. The association between HIV infection, hypogonadism, and cardiovascular diseases has yet to be determined; however, there are data that HIV infection and its treatment, particularly protease inhibitors, worsened the metabolic profiles, which were surrogate markers of cardiovascular diseases. Considerably more attention should be paid to the diagnosis of hypogonadism in this group particularly because HIV infection increases both sex hormone-binding globulin and total testosterone level. Testosterone replacement shows benefits on mood, body composition, and seems to benefit the metabolic profile in HIV infected men with low body mass index."
Doc No.10,8950,positive/labeled,22.39781,"Relationship between osteopenia, free testosterone, and vitamin D metabolite levels in HIV-infected patients with and without highly active antiretroviral therapy.","The prevalence of osteopenia in HIV-infected patients is high. However, the mechanisms implicated in bone mass loss in HIV infection are unclear. Because of this, we analyzed serum free testosterone and vitamin D3 hydroxylated metabolites in HIV-infected patients, with and without antiretroviral treatment, and the relation between them and osteopenia. Seventy-four HIV-infected patients were selected because they had frozen sera available at a date close to a DEXA evaluation. Free testosterone, 25(OH)D3, and 1,25(OH)2D3 were determined in frozen serum. There were no differences in free testosterone, 25(OH)D3, and 1,25(OH)2D3 levels between patients with and without osteopenia. 25(OH)D3 levels in naive and HAART-treated patients were 26.2 (10.3-32.8) and 33.1 (20.6-46.8) ng/ml, respectively (p = 0.04). 1,25(OH)2D3 levels in naive and HAART treated patients were 60.3 (49.2-80.8) and 85.5 (68-111.6) pmol/liter (p = 0.01). Free testosterone levels in 9 naive men and in 50 HAART-treated men were 42.6 (24.1-67.3) and 69.2 (47.5-112.1) pmol/liter, respectively (p = 0.04). In conclusion, HIV-infected patients with and without osteopenia showed similar levels of vitamin D metabolites and free testosterone. However, antiretroviral drug-naive patients showed lower serum levels of vitamin D metabolites and free testosterone than HAART-treated patients."
Doc No.11,12935,positive/labeled,22.381634,Serum leptin concentrations in human immunodeficiency virus-infected men with low adiposity.,"The product of the obese gene (ob) is the protein leptin, which is synthesized in and secreted from adipocytes. Fasting serum leptin concentrations are closely related to body fat content and are higher in obese than in normal-weight individuals. Leptin may contribute to body weight regulation. Overproduction of leptin in certain pathologic conditions such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) might in principle contribute to the low body fat content associated with body wasting. We measured fasting serum leptin levels by radioimmunoassay in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and in a group of healthy lean men to determine whether HIV infection increases leptin levels. Thirteen HIV-infected men aged 26 to 50 years with a body mass index (BMI) of 15 to 26 kg/m2 and 4 to 24 kg body fat (7% to 29% body fat) had serum leptin levels (3.4 +/- 1.6 ng/mL) that were not elevated compared with the levels in 17 healthy men (4.0 +/- 1.4 ng/mL) matched for age (23 to 47 years), BMI (18 to 26 kg/m2), and body fat (5 to 21 kg; 9% to 28%). In both groups of men, serum leptin concentrations were correlated with percent body fat and body fat content (P < .001), and these relationships were not different between the two groups. In both groups, leptin concentrations were not correlated with lean body mass (P > or = .24). Energy intake in the HIV-infected men, assessed from 3-day intake records, was within the normal range. These findings extend the hypothesis that circulating leptin concentrations directly reflect adipose tissue mass, even in HIV-infected men with low body fat content. These findings do not support the hypothesis that HIV infection is associated with high circulating leptin concentrations, and suggest that low leptin levels do not stimulate food intake in HIV-infected individuals."
Doc No.12,17613,positive/labeled,21.678389,Anemia and HIV in the antiretroviral era: potential significance of testosterone.,"Anemia, the most common hematological disorder in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is associated with decreased quality of life and survival. Hypogonadism is prevalent in advanced HIV disease, however, low testosterone levels have not been customarily implicated in HIV-associated anemia. This study was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between testosterone levels and androgen use with anemia in HIV, and to characterize other clinical correlates of HIV-associated anemia. This was a cross-sectional, observational study of 200 HIV-positive patients at a public hospital HIV clinic from July 2000 to August 2001. A written questionnaire detailed previous and current medication use, opportunistic infections, and malignancies. Hematological and virological parameters, testosterone, and erythropoietin levels were measured; CD4(+) T lymphocyte count and viral load nadir and peak levels were obtained from the computerized medical record. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin <13.5 g/dl in men and <11.6 g/dl in women. Twenty-four percent of women and 28% of men were anemic. Anemia was associated with lymphopenia (adjusted OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.36-11.80), high erythropoietin levels (adjusted OR 7.73, 95% CI 2.92-20.48), and low testosterone levels (adjusted OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.01-10.60). Anemia was negatively associated with female sex (adjusted OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.85), current antiretroviral therapy (adjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.95), current androgen use (adjusted OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.84), and macrocytosis (adjusted OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.61). Low testosterone levels may have a positive association and supplemental androgens a negative association with anemia in HIV disease."
Doc No.13,16926,positive/labeled,20.51502,"Pharmacokinetics of a novel testosterone matrix transdermal system in healthy, premenopausal women and women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.","The clinical consequences of androgen deficiency in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women remain underappreciated. The pharmacokinetics of transdermally administered testosterone in premenopausal women and HIV-infected women have not been studied. In this study we compared the pharmacokinetics of a novel testosterone matrix transdermal system (TMTDS) in healthy premenopausal women and women infected with HIV. Eight menstruating HIV-infected women, 18-50 yr of age, who had been receiving stable antiretroviral therapy, including a protease inhibitor, for at least 12 weeks and nine healthy, menstruating women of comparable age were enrolled. After baseline sampling during a 24-h control period in the early follicular phase (days 1-6), two TMTDS patches were applied with an expected delivery rate of 300 microg testosterone daily over an application period of 3-4 days. After 72 h, the patches were removed, a second set of two patches was applied, and blood samples were drawn over 96 h. Baseline serum total and free testosterone levels were lower in HIV-infected women than in healthy women. A diurnal rhythm of testosterone secretion, with higher levels in the morning and lower levels in the late afternoon, was apparent in both groups of women. Free testosterone levels were in the midnormal range at baseline in healthy women and increased above the upper limit of normal during TMTDS application. In HIV-infected women, free testosterone levels were in the low normal range at baseline and rose into the upper normal range during patch application. Serum total testosterone levels increased into the midnormal range in HIV-infected women and into the upper normal range in healthy women during patch application. The mean increments in free and total testosterone levels were significantly lower in HIV-infected women than in healthy women. Testosterone bioavailability, expressed as the mean +/- SEM baseline-subtracted area under the total testosterone curve, was significantly greater in healthy women than in HIV-infected women [3323 +/- 566 ng/dL x h (115 +/- 20 nmol/L x h) vs. 1506 +/- 316 ng/dL x h (52 +/- 11 nmol/ L x h); P = 0.016]. Assuming a daily testosterone delivery rate of 300 microg/day, the apparent plasma clearance was significantly higher in HIV-infected women than in healthy women (2531 +/- 469 vs. 1127 +/- 217 L/day1 P = 0.022), respectively. There was no significant change from baseline in serum LH, sex hormone-binding globulin, and estradiol levels in either group. Serum FSH levels showed a greater decrease from baseline in healthy women. A regimen of two testosterone patches applied twice a week can maintain serum total and free testosterone levels in the mid- to upper normal range, respectively, in HIV-infected women with low testosterone levels. During TMTDS application, the increments in serum total and free testosterone levels are lower in HIV-infected women than in healthy women, presumably due to increased plasma clearance or decreased absorption. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of physiological androgen replacement in HIV-infected women."
Doc No.14,17682,positive/labeled,20.011368,Reduced testosterone levels in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women with weight loss and low weight.,"Risk factors for hypoandrogenemia among low-weight, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are not known. Testosterone levels of 69 HIV-infected women with low weight and weight loss were compared with levels for 25 healthy, age- and body mass index-matched control subjects. HIV-infected subjects were of low weight, with a mean (+/- standard deviation) weight loss of -17.6% +/- 9.7% from preillness maximum, and 42% of HIV-infected subjects had a body mass index of <20 kg/m(2). Forty-nine percent of the HIV-infected population versus 8% of the control population exhibited low free testosterone levels (P<.001). Among HIV-infected women, when we controlled for chronic hepatitis status, age, and time of blood sampling, weight loss of >10% of maximum weight was a significant predictor of low free testosterone levels. Free testosterone levels did not differ by drug class or antiretroviral regimen. In conclusion, decreased androgen levels are common among HIV-infected women reporting significant weight loss, independent of exposure to antiretroviral medications."
Doc No.15,1797,positive/labeled,19.972008,Barriers to adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy as expressed by people living with HIV/AIDS.,"The primary objective of this study was to gain a clearer understanding of the barriers to adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) faced by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHIV/AIDS) on Long Island, New York. Focus group, a qualitative research method, was used to study these barriers. The study was conducted in 1998 on Long Island, NY, at five institutions that provide services to 1700 PLWHIV/AIDS. Five focus groups were conducted with 6 to 13 PLWHIV/AIDS in each group, a total of 39 subjects. PLWHIV/AIDS identified eight common barriers to adherence to HAART. In descending order, the barriers include: (1) frequency and severity of side effects, (2) conflicts with daily routines, (3) dietary requirements, (4) frequency of taking medications, (5) number and dosage of medications, (6) psychosocial factors (i.e., stress, feeling good, and bad news), (7) pharmacy refills, and (8) physiological needs (i.e., sleep, hunger, or thirst). Many factors play a role in the success or failure of HAART, including preexisting drug resistance, drug-drug interactions, and the ability of PLWHIV/AIDS to adhere to a rigid and frequently changing medication regimen. The information gleaned from focus groups is limited in that it may not be generalized to a larger population with any known reliability. However, clinicians sensitive to barriers to adherence to HAART, including those identified by PLWHIV/AIDS in this study, may play a more proactive role in supporting adherence to the medication regimen, increasing the durability of effective viral suppression, decreasing morbidity and mortality, and decreasing the selection and transmission of resistant strains of HIV."
Doc No.16,10422,negative/unlabeled,19.960596,HIV and hepatitis C coinfection within the CAESAR study.,"The declining incidence of AIDS-related opportunistic diseases among people with HIV infection has shifted the focus of clinical management to prevention and treatment of comorbidities such as chronic liver disease. The increased risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related advanced liver disease in people with HIV infection makes early HCV diagnosis a priority. To assess HCV prevalence and predictors of HIV/HCV coinfection, we have conducted a retrospective analysis of people enrolled in the CAESAR (Canada, Australia, Europe, South Africa) study, a multinational randomized placebo-controlled study of the addition of lamivudine to background antiretroviral therapy. The impact of HCV on HIV disease progression was also examined. Anti-HCV antibody testing on 1649 CAESAR study participants demonstrated a HIV/HCV coinfection prevalence of 16.1%, which varied from 1.9% in South Africa to 48.6% in Italy. The strongest predictor of HIV/HCV coinfection was HIV exposure category (P<0.0001), with odds ratios (ORs) compared to homosexual as follows: injecting drug use (IDU), 365 [95% confidence interval (CI): 179-742]; transfusion or blood products, 32.2 (95% CI: 15.2-67.6); homosexual and IDU, 22.9 (95% CI: 8.5-62.1). The prevalence of HIV/HCV was low (3.7%) among homosexual men without reported IDU. Other predictors of HIV/HCV coinfection were alanine aminotransferase (ALT), country of residence, ethnicity and stage of HIV disease. A history of IDU or ALT > or =40 U/L at baseline had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 35%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 96%, sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 71% for HIV/HCV coinfection. HIV disease progression was similar in HIV monoinfected and HIV/HCV coinfected patients. People with HIV and a history of IDU or elevated liver function tests should be targeted for HCV testing. The low prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection among homosexual men without a history of IDU suggests low efficiency of sexual HCV transmission."
Doc No.17,15156,positive/labeled,19.918402,"Body habitus changes, metabolic abnormalities, osteopenia and cardiovascular risk in patients treated for human immunodeficiency virus infection.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of three variables--protease inhibitors, stavudine, and the length of combined therapy--on body habitus changes, metabolic effects and bone mineral density in HIV patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The onset of possible cardiovascular involvement was considered. Forty HIV patients (29 men and 11 women, mean age 39.13 +/- 7.82 years, range 28-61 years) treated with HAART for 12-43 months were evaluated for fat, lean, bone tissues, immunohematological and cardiovascular alterations. The differences in fat/lean tissues and bone mineral density were evaluated at dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Serum lipids and the CD4/CD8 T-cell counts were recorded. ECGs were taken every 6 months; color Doppler echocardiography and color Doppler ultrasounds of the carotid vessels were performed in close chronological sequence with the second DEXA. Statistical analyses included: Student's t-test, Wilcoxon test, and single-multiple regression analysis. Thirteen patients presented with fat loss, 7 fat accumulation, and 20 a combined form of both. The changes in the single body districts showed that the decrease in the limb fat is to be attributed to protease inhibitors, while none of the three variables was responsible for the decrease in the upper limb fat. The trunk weight increase was not significant. The decrease in the lean mass of the upper limbs is to be attributed to protease inhibitors, while none of the three variables was responsible for the increase in the lean mass of the upper and lower limbs. The decrease in bone mineral density was not significant. No treatment-related cardiovascular lesions were observed. In HIV patients treated with HAART for 12-43 months, the decrease in lower limb fat was due to protease inhibitors. Neither osteopenia nor cardiovascular diseases were observed during follow-up."
Doc No.18,11559,negative/unlabeled,19.726315,Weight loss and wasting in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.,"Weight loss and muscle wasting remain significant clinical problems, even in the era of potent antiretroviral therapy. In patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), wasting, particularly loss of metabolically active lean tissue, has been associated with increased mortality, accelerated disease progression, loss of muscle protein mass, and impairment of strength and functional status. Factors that may contribute to wasting include inadequate intake, malabsorptive disorders, metabolic alterations, hypogonadism, and excessive cytokine production. Evidence now demonstrates that nutritional counseling and support, appetite stimulants, progressive resistance training, and anabolic hormones can reverse weight loss and increase lean body mass in HIV-infected patients. Despite a growing body of evidence on the importance of nutritional intervention to prevent wasting in adults, maintain growth velocity in children, and promote restoration of weight and lean body mass in stable, low-weight patients, no therapeutic guidelines currently exist for the management of weight loss and wasting in HIV-infected patients. Principles and guidelines for assessment and management of weight loss and wasting in patients with HIV/AIDS are presented."
Doc No.19,19990,positive/labeled,19.473783,Hepatitis C virus infection in individuals with or without human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.,"Serum specimens from 111 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected and 183 HIV-1 seronegative patients were analysed for antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) by enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) and radioimmunoassay. Anti-HCV and anti-HBV antibodies were found in the vast majority (89 and 83%, respectively) of intravenous drug addicts (IVDA), independent of the type of drug abuse or whether the patients were HIV-1 infected or not. Anti-HAV antibodies were found in 60% of the IVDA. Anti-HCV antibodies were found in anti-HIV-1 positive homosexual men (14%) and anti-HIV-1 negative heterosexual persons (8%), but not in HIV-1 seronegative homosexual men. Also anti-HAV antibodies were found to a small extent in these groups. In contrast, anti-HBV antibodies were common in the homosexual men. The absorbance values of the positive reactions in the anti-HCV ELISA were lower for HIV-1 seropositive patients than those for HIV-1 seronegative subjects, particularly in the late stages of HIV-1 infection. These data suggest that HCV infection is transmitted as readily as HBV infection by intravenous drug abuse and that all three types of hepatitis virus infection are common in IVDA. Although transmission of HCV is primarily mediated by blood, sexual transmission may also occur. HIV-1 infection seems to be associated with unusually low levels of anti-HCV antibodies, especially in the late stages of HIV-1 infection."
Doc No.20,10896,negative/unlabeled,19.341373,Female to male transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1: risk factors for seroconversion in men.,"To determine the frequency and risk factors for female to male sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a prospective study was carried out in 422 men who had acquired a sexually transmitted disease (STD) from a group of prostitutes with a prevalence of HIV-1 infection of 85%. The initial seroprevalence of HIV among the men was 12%. 24 of 293 (8.2%) initially seronegative men seroconverted to HIV-1. Newly acquired infection was independently associated with frequent prostitute contact (risk ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2-8.1), with the acquisition of genital ulcer disease (risk ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval 1.3-17.0), and with being uncircumcised (risk ratio 8.2, 95% confidence interval 3.0-23.0). 96% of documented seroconversions occurred in men with one or both of the latter two risk factors. In a subgroup of 73 seronegative men who reported a single prostitute sexual contact, the frequency of HIV-1 infection was 8.2% during 12 weeks of observation. No man without a genital ulcer seroconverted. A cumulative 43% of uncircumcised men who acquired an ulcer seroconverted to HIV-1 after a single sexual exposure. These data indicate an extremely high rate of female to male transmission of HIV-1 in the presence of STD and confirm a causal relation between lack of male circumcision, genital ulcer disease, and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection."
Doc No.21,2284,negative/unlabeled,19.034515,Total energy expenditure in human immunodeficiency virus-infected men and healthy controls.,"Total daily energy expenditure (TEE) has been reported to be slightly decreased in weight-stable acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. This conclusion is based on a comparison of TEE measurements to the data reported by others. We measured TEE in nine weight-stable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected homosexual men (Centers for Disease Control [CDC]-II to -IV) without active opportunistic disease and nine age-, sex-, and height-matched healthy controls using the doubly labeled water technique for 2 weeks, and resting energy expenditure (REE) using the ventilated-hood technique. TEE in HIV-Infected patients was not significantly different from that in healthy controls (221 +/- 12.5 and 210 +/- 9 kJ.kg lean body mass [LBM]-1.d-1, respectively, NS). REE was approximately 10% higher in HIV patients than in healthy controls (134 +/- 4 and 125 +/- 4 kJ.kg LBM-1.d-1, respectively, P = .02). The energy spent in relation to physical activity was not different between HIV-Infected patients and the controls (66 +/- 10 and 64 +/- 5 kJ.kg LBM-1.d-1, respectively, NS). In conclusion, REE is increased by about 10% in weight-stable HIV-infected men without active opportunistic disease. TEE and the energy spent during physical activity are not different in this group of patients versus healthy controls. This is in contrast to the previously reported decrease of TEE in weight-losing AIDS patients. Therefore, the energy requirements of stable HIV-infected patients are not decreased compared with those of healthy subjects."
Doc No.22,7134,negative/unlabeled,18.99582,Pharmacologic management of human immunodeficiency virus wasting syndrome.,"Pharmacologic interventions for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) wasting have been studied since the 1990s, but the results of these interventions have been difficult to compare because the studies used different HIV wasting definitions and assessed various patient outcomes. Thus, we performed a systematic review of the current literature to identify studies that evaluated pharmacologic management of HIV wasting and to compare and contrast treatment options. Further, we provide a comprehensive review of these treatment options and describe the definition of HIV wasting used in each study, the outcomes assessed, and whether antiretroviral therapy was used during the HIV wasting treatment. Literature searches of the PubMed/Medline (1946-2014) and Google Scholar databases were performed, and a review of the bibliographies of retrieved articles was performed to identify additional references. Only English-language articles pertaining to humans and HIV-infected individuals were evaluated. Thirty-six studies were identified that assessed pharmacologic interventions to treat HIV wasting. Appetite stimulants, such as megestrol acetate, have been shown to increase total body weight (TBW) and body mass index in HIV-infected patients with wasting. Studies evaluating dronabinol showed conflicting data on TBW increases, but the drug may have minimal benefit on body composition compared with other appetite stimulants. Testosterone has been shown to be effective in HIV wasting for those who suffer from hypogonadism. Recombinant human growth hormone has been evaluated for HIV wasting and has shown promising results for TBW and lean body mass increases. Thalidomide has been studied; however, its use is limited due to its toxicities. Although megestrol acetate and dronabinol are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV wasting, it is important to recognize other comorbidities such as depression or hypogonadism that may contribute to the patient's appetite and weight loss. If a patient is diagnosed with hypogonadism and HIV wasting, testosterone would be a good therapeutic option. Although mirtazapine is not FDA approved for the management of HIV wasting, it has been shown to promote weight gain while treating depression symptoms. Mirtazapine may be a promising pharmacologic option in the management of HIV wasting and depression, but further research is needed. "
Doc No.23,15050,positive/labeled,18.923035,The influence of human immunodeficiency virus infection and intravenous drug abuse on complications of hemodialysis access surgery.,"To examine the influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on complications in dialysis access surgery, a review was performed on patients undergoing hemodialysis at two major metropolitan medical centers over a 30-month period. One hundred eight patients underwent a total of 169 graft procedures; mean follow-up was 14 1/2 months. There were 18 (17%) patients who were HIV-positive who had no symptoms, 11 (10%) patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 79 (73%) patients who were HIV-negative. Twenty-three percent (25/108) of patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA), most of whom also had either AIDS or asymptomatic HIV infection. Dialysis procedures included 44 autogenous reconstructions (26%), 117 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts (69%), and 8 (5%) procedures of unknown type. Arteriovenous fistula or graft thrombosis was a frequent complication. The overall 12-month graft patency rate was 41%, and patients with HIV infection or a history of IVDA did not have a significantly increased risk of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of PTFE as opposed to autogenous reconstruction was the only significant risk factor found for occlusion within the first 12 months after operation (p < 0.01). Twenty-five graft infections occurred, all in PTFE grafts. The PTFE graft infection rate was 43% in patients with AIDS, 36% in patients who were HIV-positive and who had no symptoms, and 15% in patients who were HIV-negative (p < 0.05). Patients with a history of IVDA had a 41% PTFE graft infection rate versus a 13% infection rate in patients who did not have a history of IVDA (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
Doc No.24,6765,negative/unlabeled,18.912146,Total energy expenditure and carbohydrate oxidation are increased in the human immunodeficiency virus lipodystrophy syndrome.,"To determine whether total energy expenditure (TEE) is increased in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) lipodystrophy syndrome, we compared energy expenditure (EE) and substrate oxidation rates in 12 HIV-infected men with lipodystrophy, 7 HIV-infected men without lipodystrophy, and 14 healthy controls. TEE and nutrient oxidation rates were assessed by whole-room indirect calorimetry. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured by indirect calorimetry using the open-circuit technique. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Insulin sensitivity was measured using the insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. TEE adjusted for lean body mass (LBM) was significantly higher in the HIV-infected group with lipodystrophy compared to HIV-infected patients without lipodystrophy (2,873.3 +/- 69 v 2,573.9 +/- 92 kcal/d, P =.02) and compared to healthy controls (2,873.3 +/- 69 v 2,404.0 +/- 64 kcal/d, P <.001). REE and sleeping metabolic rate (SMR) adjusted for LBM were also significantly higher in the HIV-infected group with lipodystrophy compared to both HIV-infected and healthy controls. Carbohydrate oxidation rates adjusted for LBM were higher in men with HIV lipodystrophy as compared to healthy controls (362.5 +/- 23 v 250.0 +/- 22 g/d, P = <.01) and tended to be higher as compared to HIV-infected controls (362.5 +/- 23.6 v 297.3 +/- 31 g/d, P =.1). In conclusion, TEE and carbohydrate oxidation are increased in the HIV lipodystrophy syndrome. The increase in TEE appears to be due to increases in REE. The pathogenesis of elevated EE in HIV lipodystrophy and other forms of lipodystrophy remains to be determined."

Doc No.26,15241,negative/unlabeled,18.564304,Clinical factors associated with weight loss related to infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study.,"The relation between a number of potential risk factors and change in body mass index per semester was examined in a community-based cohort of 1,809 homosexual and bisexual men seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The men were followed semiannually for up to 6.5 years between 1984 and 1990. A total of 9,735 person-semesters of observations were available for analysis. A Markov-type autoregressive model, adjusting for previous body mass index, was used to predict the change in body mass index over each person-semester. Overall, the cohort was gaining weight. An asymptomatic participant 1.8 m in height whose CD4+ cell count was > 750/microliters gained a mean of 0.5 kg each person-semester. In bivariate autoregressive models, diarrhea, fever, oral thrush, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and CD4+ lymphocyte counts of < 100 and 100-199 cells/microliters were all associated with a significant decrease in body mass index. A significant inverse association was also found between change in body mass index and lymphadenopathy and herpes zoster, but when the intercept coefficient was added, no overall decrease in body mass index was seen in these models. In a final multivariate model, diarrhea was less strongly associated with a change in body mass index (p = 0.057), although AIDS (p = 0.009), fever (p = 0.006), thrush (p = 0.002), and a CD4+ lymphocyte count of < 100 cells/microliters (p < 0.001) all remained independently associated with a decrease in body mass index. Lymphadenopathy and a CD4+ lymphocyte count of 100-199 cells/microliters were also significant covariates in the final model, but neither of the beta coefficients exceeded that of the intercept, indicating that they were not independently associated with a decrease in body mass index. These findings suggest that the importance of diarrhea as a cause of HIV-related weight loss may have been over-estimated in previous clinic-based studies. AIDS and nonspecific markers of progression (fever, thrush, and a CD4+ count of < 100 cells/microliters) were the best predictors of weight loss during a semester."

Baseline hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) results were available for 1790 study subjects, of whom 122 (6.8%) tested positive. Retrospective analyses for serial HBV DNA, HBsAg, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were performed on stored sera from 118 HBsAg-positive subjects. HBV DNA and HBeAg were present in 83% and 63%, respectively. At weeks 12 and 52, median log10 HBV DNA change was -2.0 and -2.7, respectively, in the lamivudine arms, compared with no reduction among placebo recipients (P<.001). A trend to lower alanine transferase level, and delayed progression of HIV-1 disease (relative hazard, 0.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.80) were also seen in the lamivudine arms, compared with the placebo group."
Doc No.28,4184,negative/unlabeled,18.493017,Elbasvir/Grazoprevir for Patients With Hepatitis C Virus Infection and Inherited Blood Disorders: A Phase III Study.,"Direct-acting antiviral agents have not been studied exclusively in patients with inherited blood disorders and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The objective of the randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III C-EDGE IBLD study was to assess the safety and efficacy of elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) in patients with inherited bleeding disorders and HCV infection. One hundred fifty-nine adults with HCV infection and sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, or hemophilia A/B or von Willebrand disease were enrolled at 31 study sites in the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada, Israel, and Thailand. Patients were given an oral, once-daily, fixed-dose combination of EBR/GZR 50 mg/100 mg for 12 weeks and randomized to the immediate-treatment group (ITG) or deferred-treatment group (DTG; placebo followed by active treatment). The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients in the ITG with unquantifiable HCV RNA 12 weeks posttreatment (sustained virological response 12 weeks after completion of study treatment; SVR12) and the comparison of safety in the ITG and DTG. In the ITG, 100 of 107 patients (93.5%) achieved SVR12, 6 relapsed, and 1 was lost to follow-up. SVR12 was achieved in 94.7% (18 of 19), 97.6% (40 of 41), and 89.4% (42 of 47) of patients with sickle cell disease, β-thalassemia, and hemophilia A/B or von Willebrand disease, respectively. Serious adverse events were reported by 2.8% (n = 3) and 11.5% (n = 6) of patients in the ITG and DTG, respectively. Hemoglobin levels and international normalized ratio values were similar in patients receiving EBR/GZR and placebo; among patients with hemoglobinopathies, change in mean hemoglobin levels was similar in those receiving EBR/GZR compared to those receiving placebo."
Doc No.29,14151,negative/unlabeled,18.475662,The pilot study of DXA assessment in chinese HIV-infected men with clinical lipodystrophy.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient's body composition changes by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and to analyze factors associated with lipodystrophy (LD). Total-body composition was measured by DXA in HIV-infected men and healthy men. HIV-infected men were divided into LD patients and non-LD patients according to whether they were complicated with LD. Healthy men were selected as controls. Fat mass (FM) of HIV-infected patients correlated negatively with the duration of HIV infection and with the duration of highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen (r(s)=-0.448 and -0.563; p=0.032 and 0.000, respectively). Multiple linear regression results showed that FM had positive correlation with weight and bone mineral content (BMC) and had negative correlation with lean mass (LM). Total body and regional FMs were found to be significantly different among LD patients, non-LD patients, and controls-the lowest in LD patients and the highest in controls (p<0.05). Total body, trunk, and leg BMCs of LD patients were lower than those of controls (p<0.05). Lumbar bone mineral density of LD patients was lower than that of non-LD patients and controls (p=0.04 and 0.007). LM of LD patients was higher than that of non-LD patients, and trunk LM had statistical difference between the 2 groups (p=0.003). Applying DXA to assess HIV-infected patient's body composition changes could provide objective information for physicians to prevent LD and osteoporosis."
Doc No.30,6884,negative/unlabeled,18.364983,Hyperandrogenemia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women with the lipodystrophy syndrome.,"A novel lipodystrophy syndrome characterized by insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and fat redistribution has recently been described in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men and women. Women with the HIV lipodystrophy syndrome exhibit a marked increase in waist-to-hip ratio and truncal adiposity; however, it is unknown whether androgen levels are increased in these patients. In this study, we assessed androgen levels in female patients with clinical lipodystrophy based on evidence of significant fat redistribution in the trunk, extremities, neck and/or face (LIPO: n = 9; age, 35.7+/-1.7 yr; BMI, 24.7+/-0.8 kg/m2) in comparison with age- and BMI-matched nonlipodystrophic HIV-infected females (NONLIPO: n = 14; age, 37.6+/-1.1 yr; BMI, 23.4+/-0.6 kg/m2) and healthy non-HIV-infected control subjects (C: n = 16; age, 35.8+/-0.9 yr; BMI, 23.1+/-0.4 kg/m2). Fasting insulin, lipid levels, virologic parameters, and regional body composition using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry were also assessed. Total testosterone [ LIPO, 33+/-6 ng/dL (1.1+/-0.2 nmol/L); NONLIPO, 17+/-2 ng/dL (0.6+/-0.1 nmol/L); C, 23+/-2 ng/dL (0.8+/-0.1 nmol/L); P < 0.05 LIPO vs. C and LIPO vs. NONLIPO] and free testosterone determined by equilibrium dialysis [LIPO, 4.5+/-0.9 pg/mL (16+/-3 pmol/L); NONLIPO, 1.7+/-0.2 pg/mL (6+/-1 pmol/L); C, 2.4+/-0.2 pg/mL (8+/-1 pmol/L); P < 0.05 LIPO vs. C and LIPO vs. NONLIPO] were increased in the lipodystrophic patients. Sex hormone-binding globulin levels were not significantly different between LIPO and C, but were significantly lower in the LIPO vs. NONLIPO patients (LIPO 84+/-7 vs. NONLIPO 149+/-17 nmol/L, P < 0.05). The LH/FSH ratio was significantly increased in the LIPO group compared with the NONLIPO and C subjects (LIPO, 2.0+/-0.6; NONLIPO, 1.1+/-0.1; C, 0.8+/-0.1; P < 0.05 LIPO vs. NONLIPO and LIPO vs. C). Body fat distribution was significantly different between LIPO and C subjects. Trunk to extremity fat ratio (1.46+/-0.17 vs. 0.75+/-0.05, LIPO vs. C, P < 0.05) was increased and extremity to total fat ratio decreased (0.40+/-0.03 vs. 0.55+/-0.01, LIPO vs. C, P < 0.05). In contrast, fat distribution was not different in the NONLIPO group vs. control subjects. Among the HIV-infected patients, free testosterone correlated with percent truncal fat (trunk fat/trunk mass) (r = 0.43, P = 0.04). These data suggest that hyperandrogenemia is another potentially important feature of the HIV-lipodystrophy syndrome in women. Additional studies are necessary to determine the clinical significance of increased androgen levels and the relationship of hyperandrogenism to fat redistribution and insulin resistance in this population of patients."
Doc No.31,13084,positive/labeled,18.205553,Serological markers and risk factors for hepatitis B and C viruses in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.,"Both hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (HBV and HCV) infection are common in HIV-infected individuals as a result of shared risk factors for acquisition. A serological study for HBV and HCV was performed in 251 HIV-positive individuals from Medellín, Colombia. A qualitative RT-PCR for HCV was done in 90 patients with CD4+ T-cell count < 150 per mm(3). Serological markers for HBV infection were present in 97 (38.6%) patients. Thirty six of them (37.1%) had isolated anti-HBc. A multivariate analysis indicated that the following risk factors were significantly associated with the presence of these markers: age (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08), pediculosis pubis (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.01-3.33), men who have sex with men and women (OR = 3.23, 95% CI: 1.46-7.13) and men who have sex only with men (OR = 3.73, 95% CI: 1.58-8.78). The same analysis restricted to women showed syphilis as the only significant risk factor. Thus, HBV infection was considerably associated with high risk sexual behavior. HCV was present in only two (0.8%) of HIV patients. Both of them were positive by RT-PCR and anti-HCV. This low frequency of HIV/HCV coinfection was probably due to the uncommon intravenous drug abuse in this population. The frequent finding of isolated anti-HBc warrants molecular approaches to rule out the presence of cryptic HBV infection."
Doc No.32,7892,negative/unlabeled,18.143364,Prevalence and risk factors for hepatitis C virus infection among young Thai men.,"Epidemiologic studies of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are unusual in developing countries, especially Thailand. We evaluated the prevalence and risk factors for HCV among military conscripts, including a sample of 5,246 men (1:30 sample), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 positive men (N = 500) between 2005 and 2008. The HCV prevalence was 2.2% in the sampled group and 8.4% in HIV-1 sero-positives. Among the sampled group, HIV-1 infection, injection drug use (IDU) history, and unsafe injections were associated with HCV infection; adjusted prevalence rate ratios [RRs; 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] were 3.7 (1.04-12.77), 1.9 (1.04-3.54), and 1.8 (1.02-3.11), respectively. Among HIV-1 sero-positives, an IDU history and residence in southern Thailand were associated with HCV prevalence; adjusted RRs (95% CIs) were 3.5 (1.71-7.24) and 2.6 (1.18-5.61), respectively. Public health measures to prevent HCV in Thailand should focus on reducing injection drug use and other exposures to unsafe injections among young Thai men."
Doc No.33,7885,negative/unlabeled,17.615612,Association between chronic hepatitis C virus infection and low muscle mass in US adults.,"Given that low muscle mass can lead to worse health outcomes in patients with chronic infections, we assessed whether chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was associated with low muscle mass among US adults. We performed a cross-sectional study of the National Health Examination and Nutrition Study (1999-2010). Chronic HCV-infected patients had detectable HCV RNA. Low muscle mass was defined as <10th percentile for mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of low muscle mass associated with chronic HCV. Among 18 513 adults, chronic HCV-infected patients (n = 303) had a higher prevalence of low muscle mass than uninfected persons (13.8% vs 6.7%; aOR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.39-3.56), and this association remained when analyses were repeated among persons without significant liver fibrosis (aOR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.30-3.47). This study demonstrates that chronic HCV infection is associated with low muscle mass, as assessed by MUAC measurements, even in the absence of advanced liver disease. "
Doc No.34,11159,negative/unlabeled,17.613811,Prevalence trend and correlates of HHV-8 infection in HIV-infected patients.,"To assess the circulation of human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 infection over the years, two seroprevalence surveys were conducted, which tested sera from HIV-infected individuals recruited 10 years apart (206 individuals from 1986 to 1988 and 177 individuals from 1997 to 1998). For all patients, antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and HHV-8 lytic and latent antigens were evaluated.HHV-8 seroprevalence was higher among individuals recruited in the 1990s (31.6% for anti-lytic, 8.5% for anti-latent antibodies) compared with similar findings in those seen in the late 1980s (14.6% and 3.4% for anti-lytic and anti-latent antibodies, respectively), with a twofold increase of the risk of HHV-8 infection. However, the increase was observed only among injecting drug users, whereas seroprevalence tended to slightly increase among those infected by sexual contact. At univariate analysis, time of recruitment and being homosexual men were factors associated with HHV-8 infection, an association that remained after adjusting for age. HBV infection was significantly associated with HHV-8 infection (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.6), whereas those infected with HCV had a lower probability of having HHV-8 antibodies (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.20-0.6). After controlling for age and gender, time of recruitment remained independently associated with HHV-8 infection among injecting drug users. In conclusion, HHV-8 seroprevalence appears to be increased during 10 years among HIV-infected injection drug users but not among homosexual men, who remain those at the highest risk of infection."
Doc No.35,18892,negative/unlabeled,17.483412,Longitudinal evaluation of serum estradiol and estrone in male patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.,"In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection alteration of various endocrine functions have been described. However, there is limited information available on estrogens and their function in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pituitary and testicular endocrine markers: 14 HIV-positive men were included into the longitudinal study with a follow up to of 18 month period. None of the patients had a history or clinical evidence of endocrine dysfunction. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin, estrone, estradiol, and testosterone were measured in serum by commercially available radioimmunoassays. Prolactin levels were not affected in the patients. LH and FSH remained within normal range, but at the end of the study period we observed a significant increase of LH (p < 0.05). In addition, testosterone levels were normal with a slight reduction at the end of the 18-month observation period (p <0.05). Both estrone and estradiol were significantly increased with a further rise at the end of the study (p <0.05). In summary, the elevation of the serum estrone and estradiol in HIV-afflicted patients correlated with the progress of the HIV-disease, being paralleled by a decrease in testosterone. The altered relation of estrogens and testosterone may in a part be responsible for the complaints of decreased libido and increased impotence often observed in HIV-infected men."

Data were collected on 470 HIV patients diagnosed between January 1997 and December 2002. The number of cases fell over recent years and HIV transmission was sexual in 70.5%. The mean CD4 lymphocyte count was 302.1 x 10(6)/L and the mean viral load 4.70 log(10). Diagnosis of HIV coincided with an AIDS-defining opportunistic illness in 30.6% of patients and a late diagnosis (CD4 < 200 x 10(6)/L) was made in 48.3% of patients. A late diagnosis was related to male gender (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.20-5.12; P < 0.001) and AIDS case (OR 18.80; 95% CI 10.50-33.80; P < 0.00001). These results suggest that there has been a progressive reduction in new cases of HIV-infected patients, with the main route of transmission being sexual and that the diagnosis was late in almost half the patients."
Doc No.37,9097,negative/unlabeled,17.385008,Double-blind placebo-controlled pilot trial of acemannan in advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease.,"We assessed the safety and surrogate markers' effect of acemannan as an adjunctive to antiretroviral therapy among patients with advanced HIV disease receiving zidovudine (ZDV) or didanosine (ddI) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of acemannan (400 mg orally four times daily). Eligible patients of either sex had CD4 counts of 50-300/microl twice within 1 month of study entry and had received 26 months of antiretroviral treatment (ZDV or ddI) at a stable dose for the month before entry. CD4 counts were made every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. P24 antigen was measured at entry and every 12 weeks thereafter. Sequential quantitative lymphocyte cultures for HIV and ZDV pharmacokinetics were performed in a subset of patients. Sixty-three patients were randomized. All were males (mean age 39 years). The mean baseline CD4 counts were 165 and 147/microl in the placebo and acemannan groups, respectively; 90 percent of the patients were receiving ZDV at entry. Six patients in the acemannan group and five in the placebo group developed AIDS-defining illnesses. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups at 48 weeks with regard to the absolute change or rate of decline at CD4 count. Among ZDV-treated patients, the median rates of CD4 change (ACD4) in the initial 16 weeks were - 121 and - 120 cells per year in the placebo and acemannan groups, respectively ( p = 0.45), ACD4 from week 16 to 48 was 0 and - 61 cells per year in the acemannan and placebo groups (p = .11), respectively. There was no statistical difference between groups with regard to adverse events, p24 antigen, quantitative virology, or pharmacokinetics. Twenty-four patients, 11 receiving placebo and 13 receiving acemannan, discontinued study therapy prematurely, none due to serious adverse reactions. Our results demonstrate that acemannan at an oral daily dose of 1600 mg does not prevent the decline in CD4 count characteristic of progressive HIV disease. Acemannan showed no significant effect on p24 antigen and quantitative virology. Acemannan was well tolerated and showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction with ZDV."

There were no significant differences between patients treated with RBV and placebo in plasma pharmacokinetics parameters for the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) at steady state (weeks 8 to 12): ratios of least squares mean of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-12 h)) were 1.17 (95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.51) for 3TC, 1.44 (95% confidence interval, 0.58 to 3.60) for d4T and 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.50 to 1.45) for ZDV, and ratios of least squares mean plasma C(max) were 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.78), 1.06 (95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.65), and 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 1.53), respectively. Concentrations of NRTI triphosphate (TP) metabolites in relation to those of the triphosphates of endogenous deoxythymidine-triphosphate (dTTP) and deoxcytidine-triphosphate (dCTP) were similar in the RBV and placebo groups. Differences (RBV to placebo) in least squares mean ratios of AUC(0-12 h) at steady state were 0.274 (95% confidence interval, -0.37 to 0.91) for 3TC-TP:dCTP, 0.009 (95% confidence interval, -0.06 to 0.08) for d4T-TP:dTTP, and -0.081 (95% confidence interval, -0.40 to 0.24) for ZDV-TP:dTTP. RBV did not adversely affect HIV-1 replication. In summary, RBV 800 mg/day administered in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) does not significantly affect the intracellular phosphorylation or plasma pharmacokinetics of 3TC, d4T, and ZDV in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients."

Interviews with HIV-positive gay men diagnosed with acute hepatitis C.,"Since 2001, cases of hepatitis C virus (HCV) sexual transmission have been reported in France, among HIV-positive gay men who do not inject drugs. An earlier study focused on the incidence of acute hepatitis C and risk factors associated with HCV transmission. The present study, based on in-depth interviews, aimed to highlight the biography, the sexual practices and the experiences of gay men infected with HCV. Beyond an apparent uniformity, the group of interviewees illustrates a variety of situations, life stories and health pathways, depending on their age. These well-adjusted gay men were used to engaging in unprotected sexual practices, but before their diagnosis they largely ignored HCV-transmission risk, which was associated in their mind with a pejorative drug addict image. Once diagnosed with acute hepatitis C, they experienced a critical and emotional period during which they were open to discuss their sexual practices and reconsider risk-reduction procedures, without being willing to give up on their satisfying sex life. Health educators should consider labelling hepatitis C as an STI in order to disrupt its negative image and to help HIV-positive gay man raise their awareness of HCV-transmission risks and implement better risk-reduction strategies."

The study objective was to describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of this population, using data from a multisite clinical cohort of patients receiving HIV care. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of men interviewed between 2010 and 2012 were compared according to their self-identified sexual orientation, followed by multivariable linear and logistic regression to assess the association of sexual orientation with CD4 cell count, viral load, hepatitis C co-infection, self-rated health, and mental health concerns after adjustment for covariates. A total of 552 men identified as heterosexual, 2,023 as gay, and 171 as bisexual. Compared to gay and bisexual men, heterosexual men were more likely to have been born outside of Canada (34.8%); more likely to report African, Caribbean, or Black ethnicity (26.4%) or Indigenous ethnicity (13.6%); and more likely to have low socioeconomic status (59.5% earning less than $20,000 per year), and/or a history of injection drug use (31.7%). Relative to gay men, heterosexual men had 5.19 times the odds of co-infection with hepatitis C virus regardless of injection drug use history (95% confidence interval = 3.87-6.96), and 40% lower odds of rating their health as excellent or good (95% confidence interval = 0.50-0.84). HIV-positive heterosexual men in Ontario constituted a socially marginalized group characterized by a high prevalence of injection drug use history and hepatitis C co-infection."
Doc No.41,19556,negative/unlabeled,17.08541,Gender and risk behaviors for HIV and sexually transmitted infections among recently released inmates: A prospective cohort study.,"Women in prison have a higher prevalence of HIV than men. After release from prison, former inmates have the opportunity to engage in risk behaviors for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We sought to assess change in risk behaviors over time and the association of gender with risk behavior in the postrelease period. In this prospective cohort study, we interviewed 200 former inmates (51 women) approximately two weeks (baseline) and three months (follow-up) after release and tested them for HIV infection at follow-up. We examined the association of gender with unprotected vaginal or anal sex in the last seven days using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests and multivariable logistic regression. At baseline, 22% of men and 41% of women reported unprotected vaginal sex (p < 0.01) and 5% of men and 8% of women reported unprotected anal sex (p = 0.51). Being younger (OR for each decade increase 0.48, 95% CI = 0.29-0.80), being gay/lesbian or being bisexual (compared with being heterosexual, OR = 4.74, 95% CI = 1.01-22.17 and OR = 3.98, 95% CI = 1.41-11.26, respectively), or reporting a drug of choice of heroin/speedballs or cocaine/crack (compared with marijuana/no drug of choice, OR = 24.00, 95% CI = 5.15-111.81 and OR = 3.49, 95% CI = 1.20-10.18, respectively) was associated with unprotected vaginal or anal sex after adjusting for race, homelessness, and hazardous drinking. At follow-up, 21% of men and 44% of women reported unprotected sex (p = 0.005), and female gender (OR = 4.42, 95% CI = 1.79-10.94) and hazardous drinking (compared with not meeting criteria for hazardous drinking, OR = 3.64, 95% CI = 1.34-9.86) were associated with unprotected sex, adjusting for race and homelessness. In this population with a high prevalence of HIV, we demonstrated persistent engagement in sexual risk behavior during the postrelease period. Enhanced efforts to promote sexual health and reduced risk behavior among both male and female current and former prison inmates are needed, including improved access to preventive care and HIV and STI screening, testing, and treatment."

There was a reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA of 1.43 (95% confidence interval [Cl]: -2.06, -1.22) log10 copies/ml plasma over 96 weeks, and 44% (95% CI: 31, 58) of individuals had a viral load less than 400 copies/ml. A viral load below detection at 96 weeks was predicted by a baseline genotypic sensitivity score greater than 1. There was an average increase of 67 cells/microl (95% Cl: 15, 120) from baseline CD4+ T-cell count to week 96, and the percentage of patients with CD4+ T-cell counts above 100 and 200 cells/microl increased over the trial. Injection site reactions (ISRs) were less common in people with CD4+ T-cell counts >250 cells/microl at any time during follow-up, and were more severe in patients with lower baseline peripheral fat. Adherence over 48 weeks to enfuvirtide injections ranged from 96.3-99.5%. During the 96 week trial there were two discontinuations due to ISRs and two discontinuations following hypersensitivity reactions. Over the 96 weeks of study lean body mass increased by an average 2.7 kg (95% Cl; 1.7, 3.6 kg). Mean peripheral fat increased by 0.2 kg (95% Cl; -0.2, 0.6 kg). Baseline NRTI-associated toxicities resolved in 17% of participants during follow-up. Enfuvirtide is an important component of antiretroviral therapy in highly treatment-experienced individuals where NRTI sparing may be desirable."

Whereas the higher prevalence of HCV infection in HIV is clearly related to drug abuse, the reasons for the lower prevalence of HIV infection in HCV patients has not been reported. The prevalence of non-sexual and sexual risk factors associated with acquisition of hepatitis C and HIV were studied in HIV-mono-infected, HCV-mono-infected, and HCV/HIV-co-infected individuals. None of the 114 HCV-mono-infected patients tested positive for HIV and this finding was associated with a significantly lower number of men who have sex with men (MSM) among the HCV-mono-infected subjects than among either the HIV-mono-infected or HCV/HIV-co-infected individuals. Unprotected anal intercourse and sex for money or drugs were reported less often by HCV-mono-infected individuals than by HIV-mono-infected and HCV/HIV-co-infected subjects. Having sex with an intravenous-drug user (IVDU) was reported more frequently by both HCV-mono-infected and HCV/HIV-co-infected individuals than by HIV-mono-infected individuals. Sub-analysis of the group of MSM revealed that IVDU differentiated between HIV-mono-infected and HCV/HIV-co-infected subjects. These results reveal that the lower prevalence of HIV in HCV patients is related to a lower number of MSM in this group and that sex with an IVDU is a surrogate marker for drug abuse related to acquiring HCV but not HIV. The guidelines should include strategies for testing for HCV and HIV in patients with these infections."

The study was conducted in 80 centers in North America, Europe, and Australia/New Zealand. A total of 417 patients with histologically documented chronic hepatitis B (histologic activity index [HAI] 9.5-11.0) received famciclovir (500 mg 3 times daily or 1.5 g once daily) or placebo. Famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily significantly reduced HBV DNA and median HAI scores versus placebo. By week 8, median HBV DNA decreased from 1,645 to 283 MEq/mL (famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily) and from 1,147 to 304 MEq/mL (famciclovir 1.5 g once daily), while increasing for placebo (1,617 to 1,685 MEq/mL). Median change in HBV DNA at the end of therapy was -76% (famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily; P <.01) and -60% (famciclovir 1.5 g once daily; P =.25) versus -37% for placebo. Median change in HAI was -1.5 points (famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily; P =.02) and -1.0 point (famciclovir 1.5 g once daily; P =.35) and zero for placebo. Fifty percent of patients receiving famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily (P =.07) and 43% receiving 1.5 g once daily (P =.41) experienced >/=2 points improvement in HAI versus 37% for placebo. Nine percent of patients treated with famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily underwent anti-HBeAg seroconversion with undetectable HBV DNA at end of follow-up versus 3% in the placebo group (P =.05). Famciclovir was well tolerated; the incidence of post-treatment alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations was comparable with placebo. In conclusion, famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily gave modest suppression of viral replication, but translated into significant histologic improvement in median HAI score at 1 year."
Doc No.45,11850,negative/unlabeled,16.860222,"Temporal trend and factors associated with late HIV diagnosis in Hong Kong, a low HIV prevalence locality.","We studied the temporal trend of late HIV diagnosis and its determinants in Hong Kong. Three surrogate markers were used to proxy late diagnosis: AIDS within 3 months of HIV diagnosis, CD4 < 200/microL at HIV, and diagnosis at hospital. From 1984 to 2000, 1530 nonperinatal HIV infections and 495 patients with AIDS were reported. Overall, 23.9% to 52.1% of the patients were late presenters according to the three surrogates. There was no improvement in late diagnosis in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era (1997-2000) compared to the pre-HAART era (1984-1996). Gender, ethnicity, age, and HIV exposure category were significant factors of late diagnosis on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, a lower risk of late diagnosis per all 3 surrogates was observed in men having sex with men (ranges of adjusted odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-0.67 [0.21-0.91]) whereas the reverse was found for patients 35 years of age or older (ranges of adjusted ORs [95% CI], 1.62-2.80 [1.30-3.60]). In addition, male gender and Chinese ethnicity were associated with higher chance of having CD4 < 200/microL at HIV. The persistent trend of late HIV diagnosis in Hong Kong deserves attention. Strategies targeting infected people to enhance early HIV testing are needed, especially for those with risk factors of late diagnosis."

The study objective was to look for threshold values of baseline body mass index, arm muscle circumference, and fat mass to predict the risk of death in HIV-infected adults included in a 1996-1998 trial of early cotrimoxazole chemoprophylaxis in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire (COTRIMO-CI-ANRS 059 trial). The authors graphically determined if consecutive anthropometric categories with the closest hazards ratios of the risk of death could be clustered to obtain a unique threshold that distinctly separated two categories. When the threshold values were determined, the authors estimated the hazards ratio of mortality of this two-category model. A significant increase of mortality was observed for a body mass index of < or =20.3 in men (hazards ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4, 5.0) and of < or =18.5 in women (hazards ratio = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.05, 4.5) and for a fat mass of < or =6% in men (hazards ratio = 4.6; 95% CI: 2.3, 9.4) and of < or =18% in women (hazards ratio = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.2, 4.9). No simple threshold could be identified for arm muscle circumference. In Côte d'Ivoire where chemoprophylaxis of opportunistic infections has recently been recommended to be widely initiated on clinical criteria, such thresholds may help to screen patients with higher risks of mortality."

A retrospective analysis of 38 HIV-infected patients who were consecutively diagnosed as developing AHC, defined by both seroconversion of anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies and detection of serum HCV-RNA in those with previous negative results. Thirty-six patients were men with history of unprotected sexual intercourse with men and two were women with sexual and nosocomial risk factors. AHC infection was asymptomatic in 26 patients; asthenia and jaundice were the most frequent symptoms. HCV genotype 1 was present in 19 patients and genotype 4 in 14 patients. Thirty-five patients received early antiviral treatment with pegylated interferon-alfa associated with ribavirin; 15 of the 32 patients who completed the follow-up (47%) achieved a sustained virological response, as defined by undetectable HCV-RNA 6 months after the end of therapy. There is a risk of sexual transmission of HCV in HIV-infected men who have sex with men. In our experience, early treatment of AHC with pegylated interferon-alfa plus ribavirin in HIV patients achieves poor results."

Nevertheless, there are few well-documented studies about HIV and syphilis co-infection and its risk factors. The study was based on 2262 HIV infected individuals from South Brazilian HIV cohort, which began in 1991, and this analysis included individuals who were included in the cohort until November 2008. Inclusion criteria were having CD4 + T cell count and viral load at baseline, and syphilis serology tests (venereal disease research laboratory [VDRL] > 1:64 or a positive VDRL plus a positive treponemal test). A total of 1012 patients were included; 580 were men (57%); mean age at HIV diagnosis was 33 years; 591 (58%) had previous diagnosis of AIDS; most of the individuals acquired HIV from sexual contact (47.9% heterosexual and 31.7% men who had sex with men [MSM]); and 759 (75%) were on antiretroviral therapy. The prevalence of syphilis was 20.5% (208). After multivariate analysis, being male (2.01; 95% CI, 1.23-3.27; p = 0.005) and MSM (1.91; 95% CI, 1.25-2.90; p = 0.002) were significantly associated to HIV and syphilis co-infection. Males and MSM were associated with higher risk of this co-infection. Our findings may reflect that this particular population is still engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse, and efforts should be made to better target this specific group as they might perpetuate these infections."

Thirty patients were randomly assigned to either oxymetholone monotherapy (n 14) or oxymetholone plus ketotifen (n 16). Patients receiving treatment were compared with a group of thirty untreated matched controls, who met the same inclusion criteria. Body weight and the Karnofsky index, which assesses the ability to perform activities of daily life, and several quality-of-life variables were measured to evaluate response to therapy. The average weight gain at peak was 8.2 (SD 6.2) kg (+ 14.5% of body weight at study entry) in the oxymetholone group (P < 0.001), and 6.1 (SD 4.6) kg (+10.9%) in the combination group (P < 0.005), compared with an average weight loss of 1.8 (SD 0.7) kg in the untreated controls. The mean time to peak weight was 19.6 weeks in the monotherapy group and 20.8 weeks in the combination group. The Karnofsky index improved equally in both groups from 56% before to 67% after 20 weeks of treatment (P < 0.05). The quality of life variables (activities of daily life, and appetite/nutrition) improved in 68% (P < 0.05) and 91% (P < 0.01) of the treated patients respectively. Oxymetholone was safe and promoted weight gain in cachectic patients with advanced HIV-1 infection. The addition of ketotifen did not further support weight gain. These results suggest the need for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial."

We have compared the sexual practices, recreational drug abuse, history of sexually-transmissible diseases, and antecedent immunological findings of the men who seroconverted with those of 588 subjects who persistently remained seronegative in the same time-period. The cumulative incidence rate of HIV infection over the three years of observation was 8.5%. The cumulative incidence rate ranged from less than 1% for the six months before August 1, 1984, to a peak of 5% in the six months before August 1, 1985. Of those subjects for whom we had data for the period of seroconversion, all but two of the subjects who seroconverted admitted to a recognized high-risk sexual practice in the six months before the first visit at which they were found to be seropositive. Univariate analysis found that men who seroconverted were significantly more likely to have had a greater number of recent sexual partners (relative risk per partner, 1.02; P less than 0.001), to have engaged in receptive anal intercourse (incidence rate ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-7.6; P = 0.01) and to have used nitrite inhalant (incidence rate ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.9; P = 0.02) and amphetamine (incidence rate ratio, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.2-10.5; P less than 0.001) drugs.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated HIV-infected patients are frequently affected by overweight and obesity, and may be at increased risk of osteoarthritis. BMI however is a measure which does not discriminate adipose from non-adipose body mass, or fat distribution, which may have different effects. This study aimed to examine relationships between body composition and knee cartilage volume, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging in HIV infection. 35 ART-treated HIV-infected men aged 51.7 years (mean) 7.9 (SD) and 18 healthy men aged 49.5 years (mean) 6.4 (SD) participated. Cartilage volume was measured on magnetic resonance imaging of the dominant knee using validated methods. Body composition was measured using dual x-ray absorptiometry. HIV-infected participants had less total body and gynoid fat (kg) (p = 0.04 and p = 0.007, respectively) and more percent android fat mass and percent trunk fat mass (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) than controls. In HIV-infected participants there was an inverse association between total body fat mass and average tibial cartilage volume (R = -8.01, 95% CI -15.66, -0.36). Also, in HIV-infected participants there was an inverse association between android fat mass and average cartilage volume (R = -90.91, 95% CI -158.66, -23.16). This preliminary study found that both total body and android fat mass were inversely related to average knee cartilage volume in ambulant, ART-treated HIV-infected adults. These findings are features of early knee osteoarthritis and this may be of future significance in HIV."

This study aimed to assess factors associated with late diagnosis of HIV infection in young people. It employed a hospital-based case-control design, conducted during January 2012 through August 2013. A total of 193 patients aged 18-25 years old from 21 hospitals across Thailand were studied. Late diagnosis was defined as presentation when the CD4 cell count was less than 350 cells/µL within 12 months of the first HIV diagnosis, or AIDS-defining event is present within 12 months of the first HIV diagnosis. Factors associated with the late diagnosis of HIV were those who: did not live with their parent (OR 3.87; 95% CI 1.40-10.66), had no children (OR 3.25; 95% CI 1.27-8.31), had their first sexual intercourse at age older than 18 years (OR 4.25; 95% CI 1.27-14.22), had same-age or older partners (OR 3.36; 95% CI 1.39-8.08), were substance users (OR 3.65; 95% CI 1.22-10.88), believed they changed their behaviors after receiving HIV education (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.02-5.99), and sought care at regional (OR 3.19; 95% 1.31-7.79) or general hospitals (OR 3.34; 95% 1.07-10.35). Strategies for early HIV detection in young people should be reconsidered; particularly the involvement of parents and targeting the right population. "

Infectious cell-associated and plasma HIV-1 RNA virus load were measured twice at baseline and then at 7, 10, 14, and 30 days after injection by quantitative microculture and branched DNA amplification. The ratios of the geometric mean plasma HIV-1 load of the four follow-up visits compared with baseline in vaccine (n = 28) and placebo (n = 14) recipients were similar (1.05 [95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.37] for vaccine; 0.96 [95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.33] for placebo; P = .90). The geometric mean ratios of plasma virus load at each follow-up visit to baseline did not differ significantly from 1.0 for each group. Infectious cell-associated virus load measures yielded similar results. CD4 cell counts declined similarly in both groups at 6 months. Influenza vaccination did not increase HIV-1 load in this controlled clinical trial."
Doc No.54,13152,negative/unlabeled,15.996951,Treatment guidelines for HIV-associated wasting.,"Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) often suffer from weight loss manifested by a loss of body cell mass (BCM). The causes of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated wasting may include anorexia, malabsorption, and a variety of altered metabolic states. Malabsorption and diarrhea may result from gastrointestinal tract opportunistic infections or from direct effects of HIV on the gastrointestinal tract. Infection with HIV may produce metabolic derangements that alter nutrient utilization, resulting in loss of BCM. Nutritional assessment of the patient with AIDS should include an evaluation of BCM and physical and psychosocial functioning. Antiretroviral therapy and eradication of opportunistic infections do not always reverse wasting. Treatment should include nutritional counseling. Total parenteral nutrition is sometimes of benefit, particularly in patients with damaged gastrointestinal tracts. Dronabinol and megestrol acetate may promote weight gain; however, dronabinol may have adverse effects, and most of the gain with megestrol acetate is in fat rather than BCM. If gonadal dysfunction is present, testosterone replacement therapy should be included in the treatment plan. Some studies suggest that oral anabolic steroids may improve muscle strength and body composition. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, mammalian-derived human growth hormone (rhGH[m]) has produced sustained weight and BCM gains in AIDS patients. If a patient continues to lose BCM after the above factors have been addressed and corrected, a 12-week course of rhGH[m] is indicated. Halting the progression of HIV-associated wasting may improve survival, enhance physical and social functioning, and enrich quality of life."

We analysed data from three trials of modafinil or armodafinil for HIV-positive patients with fatigue, including 36 co-infected with HCV, to compare treatment response and safety parameters related to HCV status. One hundred and twenty patients received active drug and 70 were randomized to placebo. Fatigue response rate to modafinil/armodafinil was 100% for patients with HCV (18/18) and 73% (74/102) for patients without HCV. Placebo response rate was 28% (5/18) and 29% (15/52), respectively. Depressive symptoms improved only when energy improved. Viral load declined from baseline after 12 and 26 weeks of active medication. CD4 cell count did not change, nor did alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase for patients with HCV. Patients with haematocrit below the reference range responded, as well as patients whose values were within the reference range. Modafinil and armodafinil appear effective and well tolerated for treating fatigue among both HCV-positive and HCV-negative patients with HIV/AIDS, suggesting that they may hold promise for HIV-positive patients considering alpha interferon/ribavirin treatment for HCV. Further investigation in a focused trial is warranted."

With the development of HIV infection in Chad, tuberculosis has quickly become a major public health concern. The purpose of this cross-sectional study in two tuberculosis centres (Moundou and Ndjamena) was to evaluate HIV seroprevalence, epidemiological characteristics and risk factors in patients with tuberculosis. All patients with positive sputum-smears who had never been treated for tuberculosis previously were eligible. A total of 466 patients (sex ratio M/F: 1.96) were included during the six-month period between January and June 99. Each subject was asked to fill out an anonymous standardized questionnaire with detailed information on demographic characteristics, sexual behavior and other risk factors for HIV infection. Data were compared using the Chi-square test, Student's T test and multivariate analysis (logistic regression). One third (33.2%) of patients was seropositive for HIV-1. Mean age was 31.1 years in HIV-positive group and 33.6 years in the HIV-negative group (p = 0.02). The age groups with the highest risk for HIV were 20-29 years and 30-39 years (p < 0.01). Women were more often seropositive that men (39.5% versus 30.1%; p = 0.04). Seropositive patients were more likely to have multiple sexual partners (mean: 1.76; p < 0.01) and a history of sexually transmitted disease (19.9% versus 8.1%; p = 0.01). The mean age at the time of first sexual relations was 16.3 years in the HIV group and 17.1 years in the control (p < 0.01). The percentage of seropositive patients was 39.6% at Moundou and 29.8% at N'djamena (p > 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that early age of first sex relation (OR = 0.85; 95% IC: 0.74-0.97), higher number of sexual partners (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.4-2.4) and level of education were strongly correlated with HIV infection. The prevalence of HIV in tuberculosis patients is a good indicator of HIV-infection in developing countries. Prevalence of HIV infection is high in tuberculosis patients in Chad. Surveillance for tuberculosis and AIDS must be strengthened in Chad. Mores cooperation is needed between tuberculosis and AIDS control programs. Emphasis should be placed on screening for tuberculosis, early tuberculosis treatment and diagnosis of HIV in tuberculosis patients."

At the end of 2008, approximately 20% of the persons living with HIV had an undiagnosed infection. Of those living with HIV at the end of 2008, nearly two thirds were racial/ethnic minorities and half were men who have sex with men (MSM). In 2007, HIV ranked fifth as a leading cause of death among persons aged 35-44 years in the United States but third among blacks or African Americans in this age group. In 40 states with longstanding confidential name-based HIV surveillance systems, 33% of the estimated 41,768 adults and adolescents diagnosed with HIV infection in 2008 developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) within 1 year and, of these, 44% received their initial diagnosis in an acute care setting, suggesting that they received HIV testing late in the course of the infection. HIV-infected persons who are unaware of their infection or who receive a late diagnosis cannot benefit fully from timely initiation of therapy and are more likely to experience HIV-related morbidity and premature mortality. In addition, persons unaware of their infection are more likely to transmit HIV to others because of a higher prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviors and higher levels of viral RNA that continue to replicate without appropriate antiretroviral treatment."

Fischer's discriminant analysis was applied to define functions capable of differentiating between the study groups (HCV, HCV/HTLV-1 and HCV/HTLV-2). The discriminant accuracy was evaluated by cross-validation. Alcohol consumption, use of intravenous drugs or inhaled cocaine and sexual partnership with intravenous drug users were more frequent in the HCV/HTLV-2 group, whereas patients in the HCV group more often reported abdominal pain or a sexual partner with hepatitis. Coinfected patients presented higher platelet counts, but aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels were higher among HCV-infected subjects. No significant difference between the groups was seen regarding liver histopathological findings. Through discriminant analysis, classification functions were defined, including sex, age group, intravenous drug use and sexual partner with hepatitis. Cross-validation revealed high discriminant accuracy for the HCV group."
Doc No.59,12918,positive/labeled,15.860215,Effect of Pericardial Fat Volume and Density on Markers of Insulin Resistance and Inflammation in Patients With Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection.,"Treated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by ectopic fat deposition, a persistent inflammatory state, and increased cardiometabolic risk. In this secondary analysis of a placebo controlled trial of rosuvastatin among 147 HIV+ subjects (median age 46; 78% men) on stable antiretroviral therapy, we aimed to evaluate longitudinal associations between computed tomography (CT) measures of pericardial fat (PCF) volume and density, insulin resistance, and inflammation. We measured PCF volume and density (mean attenuation in Hounsfield units) by noncontrast gated CT at baseline and week 96. Homeostatic model of insulin resistance was calculated from fasting insulin and glucose at entry, 24, 48, and 96 weeks. At baseline, insulin resistance correlated positively with PCF volume and negatively with density. Similarly divergent correlations of volume and density were observed with waist:hip ratio, nadir CD4+ count, and duration of antiretroviral therapy. In a linear mixed model, PCF density was associated with insulin resistance independent of PCF volume, body mass index, metabolic syndrome, and biomarkers of immune activation and systemic inflammation; however, baseline PCF measures were not associated with longitudinal changes in insulin resistance. Soluble CD163, a marker of monocyte activation, positively correlated with PCF volume and was associated with insulin resistance in linear models. Statin treatment assignment did not affect PCF volume or density change (both p > 0.8). In conclusion, the quantity and quality (i.e., radiodensity) of PCF are differentially related to insulin resistance and inflammation in patients with treated HIV infection."
Doc No.60,575,negative/unlabeled,15.82852,Increased de novo hepatic lipogenesis in human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"We measured de novo lipogenesis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected men using a newly developed stable isotope method. HIV-infected subjects with a history of weight loss (n = 17, mean weight loss 14.9 +/- 3.2 kg), asymptomatic HIV-seropositive subjects with normal CD4 T-cell counts (n = 7) and healthy HIV seronegative controls (n = 11) were studied. Hepatic lipogenesis was determined by infusion of [2-13C]-acetate, using the recently described xenobiotic probe technique with mass isotopomer analysis. Hepatic acetyl-coenzyme A enrichment was measured by high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry of secreted sulfamethoxazole-acetate, with measurement of incorporation into very low density lipoprotein-fatty acids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Circulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interferon alpha (IFN alpha), insulin, and triglycerides were measured concurrently, and 7-day weighed food records were performed. De novo hepatic lipogenesis was increased 3- to 4-fold in HIV-infected subjects with weight loss compared to normal controls (P < 0.05 for palmitate and stearate in both overnight-fasted and fed states), and was also significantly increased in asymptomatic HIV seropositive subjects. Circulating TNF and IL-1 were not measurable in any subject (detection limit 2 pg/ml for IL-1 and 20 pg/ml for TNF). Serum IFN alpha was measurable in 11 out of 17 subjects with wasting and correlated significantly with de novo lipogenesis in overnight-fasted but not fed states. Serum IFN alpha was unmeasurable in asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects despite elevated lipogenic rates. Serum triglyceride concentrations were elevated in subjects with weight loss (2.09 +/- 0.28 mmol/L) and asymptomatic HIV-positives (1.34 +/- 0.34 mmol/L) in comparison to controls (0.67 +/- 0.08 mmol/L), and correlated with lipogenesis. Food intake correlated inversely with lipogenesis in the overnight-fasted state. We conclude that HIV infection is characterized by abnormal fat anabolism. This applies to subjects with reduced lean body mass and to asymptomatic HIV-positive subjects with normal T-cell counts. The former observation may have implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of the wasting syndrome. The latter observation is consistent with activation of the immune response and a state of viral nonlatency in early HIV disease."

Twelve subjects (86%) achieved HIV RNA levels of <400 copies/mL at week 24. Fasting glucose and insulin levels did not change. Insulin sensitivity did not decrease in the first 24 weeks, but a trend toward a decrease appeared at week 48. Six subjects experienced onset or worsening of glucose tolerance by week 24. Levels of fasting triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol increased. Bone mineral content, lean tissue, total fat, trunk fat, limb fat, and the ratio of trunk to limb fat increased at week 48. Amprenavir-based therapy was associated with increases in serum lipid levels but no short-term decrease in insulin sensitivity. A trend toward insulin resistance appeared late in the study following weight gain, particularly of trunk fat, but without loss of limb fat."

Mothers were randomized to either lamivudine 100 mg or placebo from week 32 of gestation to week 4 postpartum. At birth, infants received recombinant HBV vaccine with or without HBIg and were followed until week 52. One hundred and fifty mothers, with a gestational age of 26-30 weeks and serum HBV DNA >1000 MEq/mL (bDNA assay), were treated. A total of 141 infants received immunoprophylaxis at birth. In lamivudine-treated mothers, 56 infants received vaccine + HBIg (lamivudine + vaccine + HBIg) and 26 infants received vaccine (lamivudine + vaccine). In placebo-treated mothers, 59 infants received vaccine + HBIg (placebo + vaccine + HBIg). At week 52, in the primary analyses where missing data was counted as failures, infants in the lamivudine + vaccine + HBIg group had a significant decrease in incidence of HBsAg seropositivity (10/56, 18%vs 23/59, 39%; P = 0.014) and in detectable HBV DNA (11/56, 20%vs 27/59, 46%; P = 0.003) compared to infants in the placebo + vaccine + HBIg group. Sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of missing data at week 52 resulting from a high dropout rate (13% in the lamivudine + vaccine + HBIg group and 31% in the placebo + vaccine + HBIg group) remained consistent with the primary analysis in that lower transmission rates were still observed in the infants of lamivudine-treated mothers, but the differences were not statistically significant. No safety concerns were noted in the lamivudine-treated mothers or their infants. Results of this study suggest that lamivudine reduced HBV transmission from highly viraemic mothers to their infants who received passive/active immunization."

Antiviral drugs may help reduce the high morbidity and mortality in such patients, especially in places where liver transplant is not available. The aim was to evaluate the efficacy of tenofovir and to determine the predictors of mortality in patients with spontaneous reactivation of CHB with ACLF. Consecutive patients of ACLF due to spontaneous reactivation of CHB were randomized to receive either tenofovir or placebo. The primary endpoint was survival at 3 months. Of the 90 patients with ACLF of different etiologies, 27 (26%) were due to reactivation of CHB and were enrolled. The median baseline hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level was 9 × 10(5) IU/mL. Fourteen patients received tenofovir and 13 placebo. At 3 months the probability of survival was higher in the tenofovir than the placebo group (8/14 [57%] versus 2/13 [15%], respectively; P = 0.03). The cause of death in the 15 patients was progressive liver failure leading to multiorgan failure. Liver transplantation could not be offered due to its nonavailability. In the surviving patients, there was a significant improvement in the Child-Turcotte Pugh (CTP) and model for endstage liver disease (MELD) scores and significant decline in the HBV DNA levels in the tenofovir group, whereas these parameters did not change significantly in the placebo group. More than 2 log reduction in HBV DNA levels at 2 weeks was found to be an independent predictor of survival."

To confirm this therapeutic activity and to evaluate the effect of ditiocarb sodium in the early stages of HIV infection, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic adults with HIV infection. Patients were followed during a 24 mo period, with a clinical and laboratory evaluation every 4 mo. Of 1333 patients who continued therapy after day 1, 669 were randomized to ditiocarb and 664 to placebo. The two treatment groups were comparable at entry, except for the CD4+ cell count, which was lower in the ditiocarb (median 416/mm3) than in the placebo group (median 458/mm3). Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) developed in 106 patients in the ditiocarb group as compared with 68 in the placebo group; 285 patients progressed to AIDS-related complex (157 ditiocarb, 128 placebo); 55 patients died (34 ditiocarb; 21 placebo). The risk of progression to AIDS, after adjustment for baseline CD4+ cell count, was significantly higher in the ditiocarb than in the placebo group (adjusted relative risk = 1.41; p = 0.027). A decrease in CD4+ cell counts was observed, with no significant difference between the ditiocarb and the placebo group. A positive effect of ditiocarb given in the condition of this study can be excluded. Although previous studies have shown opposite results, this study suggests that the use of ditiocarb in HIV-infected patients should be discontinued."

Two students were seropositive (0.06%, 95% confidence interval 0-0.15%). Both were homosexual men with multiple sexual partners. Despite the low prevalence of infection, potential risk factors for transmission of HIV-1 were common, as assessed by a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. These included a previous sexually transmitted disease (12.6%), male homosexual intercourse (4.8% of men), heterosexual anal intercourse (25.3%), heterosexual intercourse with a person at risk (an HIV-1 infected person, a bisexual man, a parenteral drug user, a female prostitute, or a hemophiliac) (5.2%), multiple sexual partners (21% reported 10 or more lifetime partners), and intravenous drug use (1.3%). Assessment of the efficacy of our program by comparing responses on pre- and post-test questionnaires showed gains in knowledge about heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 and an increase in the reported frequency of condom use 1-2 months after participating in the survey. The authors conclude that HIV-1 infections are occurring among college students but in our study group remain confined to persons with known high-risk behavior; however, practices that may support transmission are common, and programs designed to diminish these behaviors among college students are needed."

Among homosexual men younger than 30 years of age, HIV infection was associated with a history of syphilis (OR = 18.2; 95% CI 5.1 to 64.7; P = 0.035) and a history of gonorrhea (OR = 8.2; 95% CI 4.2 to 16.0; P = 0.001). The association between a history of gonorrhea and HIV infection was strongest among homosexual men who had three or more sexual partners in the last month. These findings supplement existing evidence that STDs increase the likelihood of HIV transmission."
Doc No.71,140,negative/unlabeled,15.29636,"Sexual risk behavior and risk factors for HIV-1 seroconversion in homosexual men participating in the Tricontinental Seroconverter Study, 1982-1994.","Trends in sexual behavior associated with incident infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 are described and a case-control study was conducted to examine risk factors for HIV seroconversion in homosexual men who became infected with HIV between 1982 and 1994 from four geographic sites: Amsterdam, the Netherlands; San Francisco, California; Vancouver, Canada; and Sydney, Australia. Changes in sexual behaviors were evaluated from cohort visits in the preseroconversion, seroconversion, and postseroconversion intervals and were further examined over three time periods: 1982-1984, 1985-1987, and 1988-1994. In a case-control study, sexual behaviors, substance use, and presence of sexually transmitted disease were compared between 345 HIV-positive cases and 345 seronegative controls matched by visit date and site. Receptive anal intercourse was the sexual behavior most highly associated with seroconversion. The odds ratio (OR) per receptive anal intercourse partner increase was 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.09). To more carefully examine risk associated with receptive oral intercourse, analyses were done in a subgroup of men who reported no or one receptive anal intercourse partner. The risk (OR) associated with receptive oral intercourse partner increase was 1.05 (95% CI 1.0-1.11). In multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses, presence of sexually transmitted disease (OR = 3.39, 95% CI 1.95-5.91) and amphetamine use (OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.26-5.15) were independently associated with seroconversion. Although the prevalence of major risk factors has decreased over time, the associations of these behaviors and HIV infection persist, suggesting that these risk behaviors remain important avenues for public health interventions."
Doc No.72,14460,negative/unlabeled,15.242914,Social-ecological factors associated with HIV infection among men who have sex with men in Jamaica.,"In Jamaica, where homosexuality is criminalized, scant research has examined associations between sexual stigma and HIV infection. The study objective was to examine correlates of HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Jamaica. We conducted a cross-sectional tablet-based survey with MSM in Jamaica using chain referral sampling. We assessed socio-demographic, individual, social, and structural factors associated with HIV infection. A logit-link model, fit using backwards-stepwise regression, was used to estimate a final multivariable model. Among 498 participants (median age: 24, interquartile range: 22-28), 67 (13.5%) were HIV-positive. In the multivariable model, HIV infection was associated with increased odds of socio-demographic (older age, odds ratio [OR]: 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.10]; residing in Kingston versus Ocho Rios [OR: 6.99, 95% CI 2.54-19.26]), individual (poor/fair versus excellent/good self-rated health [OR: 4.55, 95% CI: 1.81-11.42], sexually transmitted infection [STI] history [OR: 3.67, 95% CI: 1.61-8.38]), and structural (enacted sexual stigma [OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01-1.15], having a health care provider [OR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.06-4.66]) factors. This is among the first studies to demonstrate associations between sexual stigma and HIV infection in Jamaica. Findings underscore the need to integrate STI testing in the HIV care continuum and to address stigma and regional differences among MSM in Jamaica."

Although the proportion of men with HCV co-infection increased between 1995 and 2000, the prevalence was similar, whereas the prevalence of men not co- infected decreased (1.93-0.46%). This suggests that HIV-1 infection associated with parenteral transmission has been stable despite a dramatic reduction in the sexual transmission of HIV-1."

The AIDS Clinical Trials Group of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.,"Zidovudine (AZT) is a potent inhibitor of the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and it has been shown to improve survival in advanced HIV disease. We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial in adults with asymptomatic HIV infection who had CD4+ cell counts of fewer than 500 per cubic millimeter on entry into the study. The subjects (92 percent male) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: placebo (428 subjects); zidovudine, 500 mg per day (453); or zidovudine, 1500 mg per day (457). After a mean follow-up of 55 weeks (range, 19 to 107), 33 of the subjects assigned to placebo had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), as compared with 11 of those assigned to receive 500 mg of zidovudine (P = 0.002; relative risk, 2.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 5.6) and 14 of those assigned to receive 1500 mg of zidovudine (P = 0.05; relative risk, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 3.5). In the three treatment groups, the rates of progression (per 100 person-years) to either AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex were 7.6, 3.6, and 4.3, respectively. As compared with those assigned to placebo, the subjects in the zidovudine groups had significant increases in the number of CD4+ cells and significant declines in p24 antigen levels. In the 1500-mg zidovudine group, severe hematologic toxicity (anemia or neutropenia) was more frequent than in the other groups (P less than 0.0001). In the 500-mg zidovudine group, nausea was the only toxicity that was significantly more frequent (in 3.3 percent) than in the placebo group (P = 0.001). We conclude that zidovudine is safe and effective in persons with asymptomatic HIV infection and fewer than 500 CD4+ cells per cubic millimeter. Additional study will be required to determine whether such treatment will ultimately improve survival for persons infected with HIV."

Evidence suggests that pioglitazone and recombinant methionyl human leptin (metreleptin) administration has beneficial effects in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected lipoatrophic patients. This proof-of-concept study aimed at evaluating whether the combination of metreleptin and pioglitazone has favorable effects, above and beyond pioglitazone alone, on both metabolic outcomes and peripheral lipoatrophy in HIV-infected patients on HAART. Nine HIV-positive men with at least 6 months of HAART exposure, clinical evidence of lipoatrophy, and low leptin concentrations (≤4 ng/mL) were placed on pioglitazone treatment (30 mg/d per os) and were randomized to receive either metreleptin (0.04 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily; n = 5) or placebo (n = 4) for 3 months in a double-blinded fashion. Compared with placebo, metreleptin reduced fasting serum insulin concentration, increased adiponectin concentration, reduced the homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance, and attenuated postprandial glycemia in response to a mixed meal (all P ≤ .02), but did not affect trunk and peripheral fat mass. HIV control was not affected, and no major adverse effects were observed. Metreleptin administration in HIV-positive, leptin-deficient patients with lipoatrophy treated with pioglitazone improves postprandial glycemia and insulin sensitivity. Results from this pilot study should be confirmed in larger clinical trials."
Doc No.77,7319,negative/unlabeled,15.126315,HCV genotype 3 is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer in a national sample of U.S. Veterans with HCV.,"Data show that viral genotype 1 may increase the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to genotype 2 in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, the effect of HCV genotype 3 on cirrhosis and HCC risk is uncertain. We identified patients with active HCV infection, confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a known HCV genotype, from the VA HCV Clinical Case Registry between 2000 and 2009. We examined the effect of HCV genotype on the risk of cirrhosis and HCC in a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for patients' age, period of service (World War I/II, Vietnam era, post-Vietnam era), race, gender, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, alcohol use, diabetes, body mass index, and antiviral treatment receipt. Of the 110,484 patients with active HCV viremia, 88,348 (79.9%) had genotype 1, 13,077 (11.8%) genotype 2, 8,337 (7.5%) genotype 3, and 1,082 (0.9%) patients had genotype 4 infection. Despite being younger, patients with genotype 3 had a higher risk of developing cirrhosis (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32-1.50) and HCC (unadjusted HR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.48-1.85) than HCV genotype 1 patients. After adjustment for prespecified demographic, clinical, and antiviral treatment factors, the risk of cirrhosis and HCC was 31% (adjusted HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.22-1.39) and 80% (adjusted HR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.61-2.03) higher in patients with genotype 3 compared to genotype 1 infected patients."
Doc No.78,6546,positive/labeled,15.122061,Correlates of high hepatitis C virus RNA load in a cohort of HIV-negative and HIV-positive individuals with haemophilia.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment failure and disease progression are more likely with high HCV-RNA load. Correlates of high HCV-RNA load in individuals with haemophilia are largely unknown. Among 1266 interferon naïve HCV-infected individuals with haemophilia, we compared those with high (> 2 x 10⁶ HCV-RNA copies/mL) to lower viral load, overall and stratifying on HIV co-infection status using logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Overall, high HCV load was independently associated with longer duration of HCV infection (P(trend)=0.0001), body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m² (OR=1.4, 95% CI=1.1-1.9), and HIV co-infection (OR=1.4, 95% CI=1.0-1.8). Among 795 HIV-negative participants, high HCV-RNA load was associated with older age at HCV acquisition (OR=1.9 for > 15 years vs ≤ 2 years, P(trend)=0.008), and lower AST/platelet ratio (P(trend)=0.01), in addition to longer duration of HCV infection (P(trend)=0.0008), and body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m² (OR=1.6, P=0.005). Among 471 HIV-positive individuals, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) was the only variable associated with high HCV-RNA load (OR=1.8, CI=1.1-2.9 for combination ART; OR=1.8, CI=0.9-3.4, for other ART vs no treatment). High HCV-RNA load with haemophilia is more likely with longer duration of infection, older age at infection, higher body mass index, and antiretroviral therapy. These findings may help identify individuals at increased risk of HCV treatment failure and progression to end-stage liver disease."

We focused on one side on their sexual practices and options for contraception, and on the other on their intention for conception and factors influencing it, in the time of highly active antiretroviral therapy. In a cross-sectional study, 200 participants completed a questionnaire. Eleven female participants took part in focus group discussions (FGD), based on their intention for conception. We used descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and Chi-square exact test to present the results from the questionnaire, and a narrative approach for the FGD results. The median age of the participants was 37 years. Almost all were sexually active (88%) and rarely engaged in risky sexual behavior. The most common method of contraception for women was the male condom (95%), followed by female sterilization (40%). Almost all men reported consistent condom use. One-third of the main sexual partners were HIV-negative. The intention for conception was significantly less after being diagnosed with HIV (29% intended pregnancies after HIV diagnosis vs. 72% before HIV diagnosis). Nevertheless, 25% of the participants expressed a desire to have a child. We found a significant positive association between the intention for conception and less years of being married, the lower number of children and the higher levels of education. Therefore, we conclude that HIV-positive men and women are sexually active and in need of comprehensive reproductive health care services including counseling on safe ways to conceive and offering a diverse choice of contraceptive methods to those who do not wish to have children."
Doc No.80,5897,negative/unlabeled,15.083235,Seroprevalence of hepatitis C virus infection and its association with natural infection of hepatitis B virus among preschool children in Taiwan.,"Taiwan is a hyperendemic area of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection where chronic hepatitis B is the most important cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatoma. Since, diagnostic kit for detecting hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been developed, HCV was found to be another important etiology of chronic liver disease. In order to study the seroprevalence of HCV infection among preschool children after mass hepatitis B vaccination program in Taiwan, a community-based survey was carried out in 54 kindergartens in 10 urban areas, 10 rural areas, and two aboriginal areas randomly selected through stratified sampling. Serum specimens of 2538 preschool children were screened for the HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) by a commercially available third-generation microparticle enzyme immunoassay and for HBV markers by radioimmunoassay methods. The multivariate-adjusted odd ratios (ORm) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated through the multiple logistic regression analysis. A total of 58 children were anti-HCV seropositive, giving a prevalence of 2.3%. The prevalence of anti-HCV was 1.0% (5 of 484) among aboriginal children, a significantly decreased seroprevalence compared with those among other ethnic groups after multivariate adjustment. Boys had a higher anti-HCV seroprevalence, but not statistically significantly different from girls (ORm: 1.6; 95% CI: 0.9-2.8; p = 0.08). The seroprevalence of the age group of 3-4 years was lower than that of the age group of 5-6 years (ORm: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1-4.2; p = 0.02). After multivariate adjustment, preschool children with natural HBV infection had a higher anti-HCV seroprevalence, but not statistically significantly different from those without natural HBV-infection (ORm: 2.6; 95% CI: 0.9-7.4; p = 0.08 for HBV-infected vs. uninfected). HCV infection varies with gender, residential area, and natural HBV infection. HCV and HBV might share common transmission routes in Taiwan."

This study is part of the national survey Behavior, Attitudes, Practices and Prevalence of HIV and Syphilis among men who have sex with men in 10 Brazilian Cities, which is a cross-sectional survey whose participants were selected by means of the respondent-driven sampling. Exact logistic regression analysis was used to measure the association of potential risk factors with HIV infection due to an HIV prevalence lower than 10% and a small sample size (383). The prevalence of HIV was 6.3% (95%CI 3.9-8.8) and the risk factors associated with HIV infection in our adjusted final model included having never been tested for syphilis (OR = 3.1; 95%CI 1.3 - 7.3) and having more than eight sexual partners (OR = 3.3; 95%CI 1.4 - 8.1). This study highlights the high prevalence of HIV among MSM in the sample compared with the general population and confirms the importance of testing for syphilis in the context of the HIV epidemic as early detection may provide opportunities to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.

Doc No.82,18938,negative/unlabeled,15.027062,Drug-resistant HIV-1 in the semen of men receiving antiretroviral therapy with acute sexually transmitted infections.,"Sexually transmitted infections may enhance the sexual transmission of HIV-1. It is possible that loss of virological control in patients with such infections receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) may even facilitate the transmission of drug-resistant HIV. We have recently demonstrated that in those on maximally suppressive ART this effect is reduced. We have examined the virus obtained from the blood plasma and seminal plasma of six HIV-1-infected men receiving poorly suppressive ART with acute urethritis for the presence of drug resistance-associated mutations. In four men with gonorrhoea the blood and seminal plasma HIV-1 had mutations conferring reduced susceptibility to one or more available drugs. In one of these men the viral load of drug-resistant virus in seminal plasma was 20-fold higher during gonorrhoea than following antibiotic treatment, with no change in blood plasma viral load. We conclude that in the presence of suboptimal ART, sexually transmitted infections may enhance the spread of drug-resistant HIV-1."

A study of four cohorts.,"The prevalence of hepatitis delta virus antibodies was determined in four cohorts of homosexual or bisexual men positive for hepatitis B surface antigen who were evaluated between April 1984 and April 1985. Antibodies to hepatitis delta virus were found in 16 of 106 men in Los Angeles (15.1%; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 8.3% to 21.9%); 6 of 64 men in San Francisco (9.4%; 95% Cl, 3.5% to 19.3%); 1 of 76 men in Pittsburgh (1.3%; 95% Cl, 0.03% to 7.1%); and 0 of 52 men in Chicago (0%; 95% Cl, 0% to 5.6%). From 44.0% to 65.4% of men negative for hepatitis delta virus and all men positive for hepatitis delta virus but one (P less than 0.0001) were positive for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In multivariate analysis, infection with hepatitis delta virus was associated with intravenous drug use (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 6.7, P less than 0.01), with sexual activity as measured by number of partners (adjusted OR = 8.4, p less than 0.01), and probably with rectal trauma (adjusted OR = 3.9, P = 0.17). As with HIV infection, prevalence of hepatitis delta virus infection in homosexual men differs by location and is most likely transmitted both sexually and parenterally."

To assess the frequency and trends of methamphetamine use, sexual activity, injection drug use, patient-provider communication, and medication adherence among HIV-infected persons in care, we administered a one-page anonymous survey in 2004 and 2006. The survey was conducted at the two University of California, San Francisco outpatient HIV clinics: at Moffitt Hospital (Moffitt), serving primarily privately insured patients, and at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), a county hospital serving primarily patients who are uninsured or publicly insured. In 2006, 39% of men who have sex with men (MSM), 33% of heterosexual men, and 11% of women reported methamphetamine use in the prior 12 months. Methamphetamine use was significantly associated with an increased number of sex partners among MSM and heterosexual men, and poor anti-retroviral medication adherence. Among MSM, methamphetamine use was more common at the SFGH clinic. Between 2004 and 2006, reported methamphetamine use in the last 12 months decreased among MSM at Moffitt (38 to 20%, p<0.01), but increased at SFGH (40 to 50%, p<0.05). Among methamphetamine users we found a high frequency of injection of methamphetamine, which increased at SFGH from 38 to 55%, p<0.05. Patient-provider communication regarding methamphetamine use has increased from 2004 to 2006 but no significant change has been found for providers asking patients about sexual activity. Overall, we found methamphetamine use to be common among HIV-infected patients in care, and associated with an increased number of sex partners, a high frequency of injection drug use, and poor adherence to anti-retroviral medications. These findings support the need for improved screening and clinic-based interventions to reduce and treat methamphetamine abuse and associated high risk sexual behaviors."

We examined the prevalence and covariates of injecting drug use among men participating in the Sydney Gay Community Periodic Survey between 2004-06 and 2011. In 2004-06, data was collected about which drugs were injected, while in 2011, data was collected about hepatitis C (HCV) and esoteric sexual practices. In 2004-06, 5.6 % of men reported injecting drugs in the previous 6 months; 3.4 % reported methamphetamine injection and 0.4 % heroin injection. In 2011, men who injected drugs were less likely to be employed full-time, and more likely to be HCV-positive, HIV-positive, to have used party drugs for sex, and to have engaged in esoteric sexual practices. The strong associations between injecting drug use, sexual risk practices and blood-borne virus infection suggests the need for combined sexual health and harm reduction services for gay and bisexual men who inject drugs."
Doc No.86,512,negative/unlabeled,14.849085,Prevalence and risk factors for hepatitis C virus infection at an urban Veterans Administration medical center.,"This study was designed to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in veterans. Anti-HCV testing was performed in 1,032 patients and a questionnaire regarding sociodemographic characteristics and potential risk factors was administered. Adjusted prevalence of unique HCV-positive patients using outpatient services was 17.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.2%, 18.2%). The following risk factors were associated with HCV infection: a history of injection drug use (IDU), receipt of blood transfusion prior to 1992, history of tattoo (odds ratio [OR], 2.93; 95% CI, 1.70-5.08), combat job as a medical worker (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.25-5.60), history of incarceration over 48 hours (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.52-4.32), greater than 15 lifetime sexual partners (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.94-2.76) and sexual relations with a prostitute (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.82). We concluded that HCV is common in veterans. Risk factors independently associated with infection are IDU, prior transfusion, prior tattoo, combat medical work, incarceration, and multiple opposite sex partners. Infection with HCV among veterans is strongly associated with traditional risk factors for infection and less strongly associated with combat-related risk."

Results of the APRICOT study].,"Until the publication in 2004 of the Apricot, ACTG 5071, and ANRS Ribavic trials, data about the treatment of patients coinfected with HIV and HCV were sparse. The international Apricot study included 868 HIV-HCV-coinfected patients naive of all HCV treatments. They were randomized into 3 groups for 48 weeks of hepatitis C treatment by peginterferon alpha-2a + ribavirin, or peginterferon alpha-2a + placebo, or interferon alpha-2a + ribavirin. Six months after treatment stopped, sustained virologic response (the principal efficacy criterion, intention-to-treat analysis) was observed in 40% of patients treated by peginterferon + ribavirin (29% for the nonresponsive genotype 1, and 62% for genotypes 2 and 3), 20% of those receiving peginterferon + placebo, and 12% of those in the group of nonpegylated interferon + ribavirin. This study also validated the positive and negative predictive values of viral load analyzed at 12 weeks of treatment; it was best for patients in genotypes 2 and 3. The factors associated with the best virologic response were a non-1 genotype and a low HCV viral load (< 800,000 IU/mL). As pointed out in the guidelines of the last European consensus conference on coinfection, the combination of peginterferon + ribavirin is currently the reference treatment for chronic hepatitis C. It should also be the preferred treatment for patients with HIV-HCV coinfection."

The 468 participants were recruited among visitors to the Clinic for Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Amsterdam. Sera were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Ortho), a recombinant-based immunoblot assay (RIBA; Chiron), and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 468 persons were tested, and seven (1.5%) were found ELISA positive. Another 25 (5%) were ELISA indeterminate. Six of the seven ELISA-positive cases were RIBA positive. Further serum samples from five HCV ELISA-positive persons were tested by PCR, and four were found to be positive. The HCV ELISA-positive/RIBA-indeterminate reaction was PCR negative. None of the 17 RIBA-tested sera of the ELISA-indeterminate group yielded a positive result. There was a good correlation between an ELISA optical density/cut-off ratio greater than 2 and a positive RIBA result. The risk factor for HCV appeared to be the type of sexual partner, i.e., belonging to a ""high-risk"" group for human immunodeficiency virus infection and origin from hepatitis B-endemic countries. It is concluded that HCV may be transmitted through heterosexual contact but probably with low efficiency."
Doc No.89,12251,positive/labeled,14.804918,Prevalence of unsafe sexual behavior among HIV-infected individuals: the Swiss HIV Cohort Study.,"Sexual contact is the major mode of HIV transmission. Increased sexual risk taking has been described in HIV-infected individuals receiving potent antiretroviral therapy. A new questionnaire on sexual behavior was introduced into the Swiss HIV Cohort Study on April 1, 2000. We evaluated sexual behavior in all individuals who completed the questionnaire for the first time within 1 year after its introduction. Our primary hypothesis was that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior would be more prevalent among individuals with optimal viral suppression. On April 1, 2000, 4948 individuals were registered in the study, and 4723 (95%) completed the questionnaire. Of these individuals, 12% reported unsafe sex, 78% received antiretroviral therapy, and 25% had optimal viral suppression (HIV RNA level always <50 copies/mL during the preceding 12 months). During the preceding 6 months, 55% of individuals had stable and 19% had occasional partners, and 6% had both types of partners. Sexual intercourse was reported by 82% of individuals with stable and 87% of individuals with occasional partners, and of those reporting sexual intercourse in each group, 76% and 86%, respectively, said that they always used condoms. After adjustment for covariates, reported unsafe sex was not associated with optimal viral suppression (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.33) or antiretroviral therapy (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.07), but it was associated with gender, age, ethnicity, HIV transmission group, HIV status of partner, having occasional partners, and living alone. There is no evidence that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior is more prevalent among HIV-infected individuals with optimal viral suppression. However, unsafe sex is associated with other factors."

Serum samples were screened for HSV-2 antibodies using an indirect ELISA. Eighty-three patients were men (mean age: 38.8) and 67 were women (mean age: 35.4). The estimated prevalence of HSV-2 was 52% (95% CI: 44-60%) and it was higher among men (53%) than among women (50.7%). Overall, the age of first sexual intercourse and past history of genital herpes were associated with HSV-2 seropositivity. Analysis by gender disclosed significant association of number of lifetime sex partners only among men. Although HSV-2 antibodies were frequent in the study group, genital herpes was reported by 21.8% of the HSV-2 positive subjects, indicating low awareness of the HSV-2 infection. These results may have public health importance for Brazil as the high rate of HSV-2 infection may act as a cofactor of HIV transmission."

We cultured the pharynx of 264 asymptomatic HIV-positive MSM in downtown Madrid. A questionnaire on sexual and drug use risk behaviours was also administered. Gonococci were isolated in 25 (9.5%). Among the whole study population, 65% had a history of sexual intercourse with two or more partners on a single day and 26% were involved in group sex with other men. Only 29% regularly used condoms in all sexual encounters and 63% used condoms only in insertive anal intercourse. When asked about oral sex, 89% of patients engaged in insertive and/or receptive oral sex and 86% recognized that they did not regularly request the use of condoms when practising ""fellatio"" on a partner. Cocaine, crystal methamphetamine or alcohol use and a previous history of ≥1 sexually transmitted infection were significantly more common among culture-positive patients. Gonococcal colonization of the pharynx was self-limited in patients that were not treated and re-cultured a mean 18.5 ± 5.2 days after diagnosis. Asymptomatic pharyngeal gonorrhoea is common among HIV-positive MSM and may contribute to the increasing epidemic of gonorrhoea in Madrid. "
Doc No.92,10714,negative/unlabeled,14.720482,Risk factors for infection with human immmunodeficiency virus among European expatriates in Africa.,"The pattern of cases of AIDS in Belgium suggests that Europeans infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquired the infection in Africa. The prevalence of infection was assessed in Belgian advisers and European expatriates and risk factors for infection defined in a case-control study of expatriate men. Fifteen (1.1%) of 1401 Belgian advisers working in Africa and 41 (0.9%) of 4564 European expatriates living in Africa, were positive for antibody to HIV in a voluntary screening programme in Belgium. Among subjects with antibody to HIV the ratio of men to women was 3:1. These subjects did not have a history of intravenous drug abuse or blood transfusion and only one was homosexual. In a case-control study of 33 expatriate men who had antibody to HIV and 119 controls the men with antibody reported significantly more female sexual partners, who were more commonly local; and significantly more sexual contact with prostitutes in Africa. They had a significantly higher prevalence of history of sexually transmitted disease and had received significantly more injections by unqualified staff in Africa during the previous five years. No specific sexual practices were associated with having antibody to HIV. After multivariate analysis sexual contact with local women (adjusted odds ratio 14.7; 95% confidence interval 2.81 to 76.9), sexual contact with prostitutes (adjusted odds ratio 10.8 (1.6 to 71.9), and injections by unqualified staff (adjusted odds ratio 13.5 (3.7 to 49.8) remained independent risk factors for infection. European expatriates in Africa were at increased risk from infection with HIV and were a means of introducing HIV into the heterosexual population in Europe. Transmission from women to men by vaginal intercourse seemed to be the most probable route of infection."
Doc No.93,15138,positive/labeled,14.697624,Prevalence of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and condom use among outpatients at a sexually transmitted disease clinic in Rome.,"To assess the prevalence of HIV-1 infection and study selected risk factors among patients attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases in Rome, 1442 outpatients seen consecutively between 20 February and 12 December 1989 were anonymously tested for anti-HIV-1. An evaluation of the trend of the HIV-1 infection was attempted by comparing the results of the present study with those obtained from a similar sample studied in 1986 in the same clinic. The overall estimated prevalence of anti-HIV-1 was 1.2% among heterosexual non-drug user subjects and 16.1% among homosexual or bisexual men. The anti-HIV-1 seropositivity was significantly higher in heterosexual subjects who reported sexual contact with intravenous drug users, as compared with those who did not report such exposure (12.5% vs 0.8%, p less than 0.005). Comparing the present data with those of a study conducted in 1986 in the same clinic, a lower prevalence of anti-HIV-1 was found among heterosexual subjects (1.2% in 1989 vs 6.0% in 1986, p less than 0.001). The availability after 1986 of several outpatient facilities attracting seropositive subjects and a change in the sexual behaviour of anti-HIV-1 positive subjects could explain this finding. Twenty percent of the heterosexual subjects and 62% of the homosexual or bisexual men reported consistent use of condoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Prevalent HCV infection was detected in 2.4% of non-injection drug using (IDU) participants. Controlling for other associated factors, and excluding IDU, men who used informal health-care providers were five times as likely to be HCV infected as those who did not use informal providers (Adjusted Odds Ratio, AOR = 5.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.57, 21.6), a finding not detected in women. More research is needed to determine the extent to which HCV infection is associated with reuse of contaminated injection equipment in health-care settings in developing countries."

ANRS 005-ACTG 154 Trial Group. Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le SIDA (ANRS-INSERM) and the NIAID-AIDS Clinical Trials Group.,"Although drug-induced rash is frequent in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, rash due to pyrimethamine has not been described previously. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of pyrimethamine as primary prophylaxis for toxoplasmic encephalitis, the incidence of rash (per hundred patient-years) was 8.1 in the pyrimethamine group versus 1.5 in the placebo group (P < .0002). The 1-year incidence of toxoplasmic encephalitis after occurrence of rash was 37%, as compared with 9.6% in the pyrimethamine group without rash, with a 3.7 times higher risk for patients with pyrimethamine-induced rash (P = .001); the incidence was 13% in the placebo group. At the time of toxoplasmic encephalitis, pyrimethamine was successfully readministered to 80% of patients who discontinued it because of rash. Thus, pyrimethamine, when used for prophylaxis, does induce rash in HIV-infected patients. These patients are at higher risk for toxoplasmic encephalitis and should be carefully monitored for it."
Doc No.97,11247,negative/unlabeled,14.645009,Increased prevalence of oral Candida albicans serotype B in homosexual men: a comparative and longitudinal study in HIV-infected and HIV-negative patients.,"Several investigators have shown a comparatively high prevalence of Candida albicans serotype B among HIV-infected individuals. We serotyped oral C. albicans strains from 50 HIV-infected homosexual men, 39 HIV-seronegative homosexual men and 40 clinical oral isolates of a control group. The prevalence of serotype B was significantly higher in homosexual men, regardless of HIV serostatus, than in the control subjects. We suggest that the reported high prevalence of serotype B among AIDS patients in Europe and the USA simply reflects the high proportion of homosexual men among HIV-infected patients. In 22 subjects, oral C. albicans isolates were obtained at two or more time points, up to 8 years apart. No change in serotype was observed over time. The serotype prevalences in HIV-infected patients with oral thrush or AIDS-defining illness were similar to the group of homosexual men as a whole, indicating that there is no serotype-related variation in pathogenicity."
Doc No.98,15602,negative/unlabeled,14.636603,Sexual practices and condom usage in a cohort of homosexual men in relation to human immunodeficiency virus status.,"Between January 1, and October 31, 1987, 420 homosexual men who participated in a cohort study of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) completed a questionnaire that examined their sexual practices during the previous six months. Of the subjects, 205 (48.8%) men were HIV-seropositive and 215 (51.2%) men were HIV-seronegative. Although there was an appreciable level of condom usage in both groups, 13.5% of the HIV-seronegative men had engaged in unprotected receptive anal intercourse and 6.3% of the HIV-seropositive men had engaged in unprotected insertive anal intercourse. Condom breakage was reported on approximately 6% of occasions by a minority of subjects. Among subjects who were in a relationship with a regular male sexual partner, the most commonly reported sexual practices were deep kissing, mutual masturbation and receptive oral intercourse without ejaculation. No HIV-seronegative man engaged in unprotected receptive and/or insertive anal intercourse, receptive oral intercourse with ejaculation or receptive and/or insertive ""fisting"" with a regular partner who was HIV-seropositive. No HIV-seropositive man engaged in unprotected insertive anal intercourse to ejaculation with an HIV-seronegative partner, although they did so with partners who were HIV-seropositive or of unknown status. On multivariate analyses the subject's antibody status was found to be associated with receptive anal intercourse with a condom (P = 0.007) and mutual masturbation (P = 0.001), with HIV-seronegative men being more likely to practise either; no significant independent effect was associated with the partner's antibody status. These findings provide important information on the types and levels of sexual practices in a group of homosexual men after the recognition of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in this country."
Doc No.99,1306,positive/labeled,14.625026,Increased risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 among uncircumcised men presenting with genital ulcer disease in Kenya.,"The factors responsible for the explosive spread of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in sub-Saharan Africa continue to be identified and debated. One of the most controversial factors has been male circumcision. This cross-sectional study was conducted to measure the association between circumcision status and infection with HIV-1 among men with genital ulcer disease. Eight hundred and ten men participated in the study, of whom 190 (23%) were HIV-1-positive. A logistic regression model adjusted for behavioral and historical showed that HIV-1 positivity was independently associated with being uncircumcised (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3-7.2) and with a history of urethral discharge (adjusted OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.8). This association could not be explained by measures of sexual exposure to HIV-1 among this population. Male circumcision should be considered as an intervention strategy for AIDS control."
Doc No.100,7506,negative/unlabeled,14.611918,"Hepatitis C virus coinfection in a cohort of HIV-infected individuals from Santos, Brazil: seroprevalence and associated factors.","Although HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection has been recognized worldwide in individuals exposed to blood-borne and sexually transmitted diseases (STD), limited data are available on the epidemiology of this coinfection in Brazil. A cross-sectional study was carried out to estimate the prevalence of HCV seropositivity in a cohort of people living with HIV/AIDS in Santos, Brazil, and to investigate potential risk factors for HCV infection. Anti-HCV antibodies were sought by using two immunoenzymatic assays. Overall HCV seroprevalence was 36.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31.9-40.4%). However, it was significantly higher (84.8%, 95% CI 78.2-91.3%) among intravenous drug users (IDU) as compared to non-IDU (20.9%, 95% CI 16.8-25.1%) (p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that HCV seropositivity among IDU was independently associated with needle sharing (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] = 4.28, p = 0.07) and with serologic evidence of exposure to other bloodborne agents: HBV (adjOR = 4.39, p = 0.01) and HTLV-I/II (adjOR = 6.43, p = 0.02). In contrast, no association with lifetime number of sexual partners, history of STD, or of sex with commercial sex workers (CSW) could be demonstrated. Among non-IDU, HCV seropositivity was independently associated with sexual partnership with IDU (adjOR = 2.15, p = 0.08) and with HBV seropositivity (adjOR = 1.71, p = 0.05), but not with engaging in oral or anal receptive intercourse or having sex with CSW. Results indicate that exposure to blood and sexual partnership with IDU constitute the main risk factors for HCV acquisition among HIV-positive patients in Santos, Brazil. Prevention of HCV spread in this population should thus include harm reduction measures and information on safer sex practices for both IDU and their sexual partners."
