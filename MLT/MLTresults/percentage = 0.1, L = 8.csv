Doc No.1,8908,negative/unlabeled,39.668304,Impact of viral activators and epigenetic regulators on HIV-1 LTRs containing naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms.,"Following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration into host cell DNA, the viral promoter can become transcriptionally silent in the absence of appropriate signals and factors. HIV-1 gene expression is dependent on regulatory elements contained within the long terminal repeat (LTR) that drive the synthesis of viral RNAs and proteins through interaction with multiple host and viral factors. Previous studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and Sp site III (3T, C-to-T change at position 3, and 5T, C-to-T change at position 5 of the binding site, respectively, when compared to the consensus B sequence) that are low affinity binding sites and correlate with more advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. Stably transfected cell lines containing the wild type, 3T, 5T, and 3T5T LTRs were developed utilizing bone marrow progenitor, T, and monocytic cell lines to explore the LTR phenotypes associated with these genotypic changes from an integrated chromatin-based microenvironment. Results suggest that in nonexpressing cell clones LTR-driven gene expression occurs in a SNP-specific manner in response to LTR activation or treatment with trichostatin A treatment, indicating a possible cell type and SNP-specific mechanism behind the epigenetic control of LTR activation.

Doc No.2,2394,negative/unlabeled,29.279804,Food insecurity is associated with increased risk of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy among HIV-infected adults in the Democratic Republic of Congo: a cross-sectional study.,"Food insecurity is increasingly reported as an important barrier of patient adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in both resource-poor and rich settings. However, unlike in resource rich-settings, very few quantitative studies to date have investigated the association of food insecurity with patient adherence to ART in Sub-Saharan Africa. The current study examines the association between food insecurity and adherence to ART among HIV-infected adults in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)."
Doc No.3,2359,positive/labeled,29.183979,Food insecurity is associated with incomplete HIV RNA suppression among homeless and marginally housed HIV-infected individuals in San Francisco.,"There is growing international concern that food insecurity may negatively impact antiretroviral (ARV) treatment outcomes, but no studies have directly evaluated the effect of food insecurity on viral load suppression and antiretroviral adherence. We hypothesized that food insecurity would be associated with poor virologic response among homeless and marginally housed HIV-positive ARV-treated patients."
Doc No.4,8438,negative/unlabeled,28.045769,"Patient-provider interaction, patient satisfaction, and health outcomes: testing explanatory models for people living with HIV/AIDS.","In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy era, medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) have become critical issues for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). The purpose of this study was to test explanatory models of how patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction are related to medication adherence and HRQOL for PLWH. A total of 344 PLWH receiving health-care services from a federally funded clinic in the southwest USA completed a survey questionnaire about their perception of interactions with providers, their satisfaction with services, their medication adherence, and their HRQOL. Comparing four latent variable structural equation models of direct and mediated effects of patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction, the findings illustrate that the best model is one in which patient-provider interaction has a direct and positive effect on patient satisfaction, medication adherence, and HRQOL. These findings suggest that quality patient-provider interaction is a critical element of health-care services for PLWH, while patient satisfaction is an outcome measure and not a mediating factor for medication adherence and HRQOL. "
Doc No.5,1795,negative/unlabeled,26.248034,Supplementary feeding in the care of the wasted HIV infected patient.,"Wasting and food insecurity are commonly seen in patients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, and supplementary feeding is often offered in conjunction with ART. Evidence for the effectiveness of such supplementary feeding is scant. A randomised, investigator-blinded, controlled clinical trial of two types of supplementary food, corn/soy blended flour and a ready-to-use peanut butter-based lipid paste, in wasted adults in Blantyre, Malawi is described and the results summarised. A historical control group who did not receive supplementary food is described as well. Provision of about half of the daily energy requirement as a supplementary food for 14 weeks resulted in more rapid restoration of a normal BMI; and the energy-dense, ready-to-use paste was associated with more rapid weight gain than the blended flour. Survival was similar among the 3 groups. The strong association between lower BMI and survival indirectly suggests that there may well be clinical benefit from supplementary feeding in this population. No differences were seen in ART adherence or quality of life with more rapid restoration of BMI. Further research is urgently needed concerning the widespread practice of supplementary feeding in HIV/AIDS care to most effectively utilize this intervention."
Doc No.6,8417,negative/unlabeled,25.388336,Bounded agency in humanitarian settings: a qualitative study of adherence to antiretroviral therapy among refugees situated in Kenya and Malaysia.,"HIV-positive refugees confront a variety of challenges in accessing and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and attaining durable viral suppression; however, there is little understanding of what these challenges are, how they are navigated, or how they may differ across humanitarian settings. We sought to document and examine accounts of the threats, barriers and facilitators experienced in relation to HIV treatment and care and to conduct comparisons across settings. We conducted semi-structured interviews among a purposive sample of 14 refugees attending a public, urban HIV clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (July-September 2010), and 12 refugees attending a camp-based HIV clinic in Kakuma, Kenya (February-March 2011). We used framework methods and between-case comparison to analyze and interpret the data, identifying social and environmental factors that influenced adherence. The multiple issues that threatened adherence to antiretroviral therapy or precipitated actual adherence lapses clustered into three themes: ""migration"", ""insecurity"", and ""resilience"". The migration theme included issues related to crossing borders and integrating into treatment systems upon arrival in a host country. Challenges related to crossing borders were reported in both settings, but threats pertaining to integration into, and navigation of, a new health system were exclusive to the Malaysian setting. The insecurity theme included food insecurity, which was most commonly reported in the Kenyan setting; health systems insecurity, reported in both settings; and emotional insecurity, which was most common in the Kenyan setting. Resilient processes were reported in both settings. We drew on the concept of ""bounded agency"" to argue that, despite evidence of personal and community resilience, these processes were sometimes insufficient for overcoming social and environmental barriers to adherence. In general, interventions might aim to bolster individuals' range of action with targeted support that bolsters resilient processes. Specific interventions are needed to address locally-based food and health system insecurities. "
Doc No.7,701,positive/labeled,24.136297,Food insecurity is associated with poor virologic response among HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral medications.,Food insecurity negatively impacts HIV disease outcomes in international settings. No large scale U.S. studies have investigated the association between food insecurity and severity of HIV disease or the mechanism of this possible association. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of food insecurity on HIV disease outcomes in a large cohort of HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral medications.
Doc No.8,7079,negative/unlabeled,21.83898,CD28 costimulation and CD28 expression in T lymphocyte subsets in HIV-1 infection with and without progression to AIDS.,"In a prospective study of 152 HIV-1 patients (with and without progression to AIDS) we examined CD28 MoAb costimulation and CD3 MoAb response using whole blood culture at baseline and up to either the time of AIDS diagnosis or the end of the observation period. CD28 antigen expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes was also studied in both groups of patients. In patients who progressed to AIDS, CD28 MoAb costimulation was found to be decreased. Univariate time-dependent analysis showed that decreases in (i) absolute numbers of either CD4+, CD4+CD28+, CD8+CD28+ T cells, (ii) CD28 MoAb costimulation, and (iii) CD3 MoAb response, and an increase in CD8+CD28- %, are significant predictors for progression to AIDS. In addition, multivariate time-dependent analysis demonstrated that a decrease in CD28 MoAb costimulation (but not a decrease in CD3 MoAb response) was predictive for progression to AIDS, as were decreases in the percentage of CD4+ T cells and the absolute number of CD4+CD28+ T cells. Thus, CD28 MoAb costimulation can be considered a useful assay for monitoring HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, apart from the early increase in the percentage of CD8+CD28- T cells and an increase in the percentage of CD28- on CD8+ T cells in both groups of patients at baseline compared with normal controls, a negative correlation was found to exist between the percentages of CD4+ or CD4+CD28+ T cells and the percentage of CD8+CD28- T cells; this suggests that these cells are probably mutually regulated."
Doc No.9,6315,positive/labeled,21.34857,Increased cytolytic T lymphocyte activity and decreased B7 responsiveness are associated with CD28 down-regulation on CD8+ T cells from HIV-infected subjects.,"The CD28 receptor on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells interacts with B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APC) to generate essential costimulatory signals. The cytolytic potential of CD8+ T cells could be linked to CD28 expression. Since HIV induces dysfunction of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, we evaluated CD28 expression and function in both subsets during HIV infection. CD28 expression on CD8+ T cells from HIV+ subjects was strongly reduced in a disease stage-related fashion. CD28- CD8+ T cells preferentially expressed CD57 and CD11b, but lacked CD26 and IL-2R alpha. The CD8+ T cells from the patients showed a significantly reduced proliferative response to co-stimulation with cell-bound anti-CD3 and B7. Nevertheless, when stimulated with plate-fixed anti-CD3, CD8+ T cells from HIV-infected subjects proliferated normally, and normal levels of IL-2R alpha and transferrin-receptor could be induced on CD28- CD8+ T cells from the patients. In addition, stimulation with plate-fixed anti-CD3 induced proliferative responses in highly purified CD28- CD8+ T cells from both HIV- and HIV+ persons. Furthermore, the increased cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HIV+ subjects, measured in an anti-CD3 redirected assay, was predominantly exerted by CD28- CD57+ T cells. CD4+ T cells from the patients showed a slight but significant CD28 down-regulation and were slightly hyporesponsive to B7 co-stimulation. Decrease of CD28 on CD8+ T cells from HIV+ subjects is associated with an impaired response to co-stimulation via B7. CD28- CD8+ T cells from seropositives, however, are not completely inert, since they contain in vivo activated CTL and they can be additionally activated through a B7-independent stimulation."
Doc No.10,5872,positive/labeled,20.99067,Substance use predictors of poor medication adherence: the role of substance use coping among HIV-infected patients in opioid dependence treatment.,"Many HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) continue to use illicit substances despite being in substance use treatment. Substance use is associated with non-adherence to HIV medications; however underlying mechanisms regarding this relation are understudied. The current investigation examined the role of substance use coping in terms of the relation between substance use and HIV medication adherence. Participants were 121 HIV-infected IDUs (41 % female, M age = 47, SD = 7.1) in opioid dependence treatment. Participants completed self-report questionnaires, were administered clinical interviews and oral toxicology screens, and used a medication-event-monitoring-system cap to assess 2 week HIV medication adherence. The use of cocaine and multiple substances were significantly related to decreased medication adherence. Substance use coping mediated these associations. Findings highlight the importance of assessing, monitoring, and targeting ongoing substance use, and ways to increase positive coping for HIV-infected IDUs in substance use treatment to aid in HIV medication adherence."
Doc No.11,8267,negative/unlabeled,20.595652,Position of the American Dietetic Association:  Nutrition Intervention and Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection.,"It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that efforts to optimize nutritional status through individualized medical nutrition therapy, assurance of food and nutrition security, and nutrition education are essential to the total system of health care available to people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection throughout the continuum of care. Broad-based efforts to improve health care access and treatment have stabilized HIV prevalence levels in many parts of the world and led to longer survival for people living with HIV infection. Confounding clinical and social issues, such as medication interactions, comorbidities, wasting, lipodystrophy, food insecurity, aging, and other related conditions further complicate disease management. With greater understanding of the mechanisms of HIV disease and its impact on body function, development of new treatments, and wider ranges of populations affected, the management of chronic HIV infection continues to become more complex and demanding. Achievement of food and nutrition security and management of nutrition-related complications of HIV infection remain significant challenges for clients with HIV infection and health care professionals. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, should integrate their efforts into the overall health care strategies to optimize their clinical and social influence for people living with HIV infection."
Doc No.12,7265,negative/unlabeled,19.974298,"Psychological distress, drug use, sexual risks and medication adherence among young HIV-positive Black men who have sex with men: exposure to community violence matters.","In the USA, Black males are disproportionately affected by community violence and HIV. The aim of this study was to assess whether exposures to community violence are related to psychological distress, drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and medication adherence among a sample of HIV-positive young Black men who had sex with men (YBMSM). Data are from 98 YBMSM ages 18-29 years recruited from Chicago who completed measures on demographics, exposures to community violence, psychological distress, drug use, condomless anal intercourse, and medication adherence. Rates of exposure to community violence were high and youth reported victimization and witnessing numerous types of violence in their lifetime. In adjusted logistic regression analyses, models indicate that YBMSM reporting higher levels of exposure to community violence had significantly higher rates of condomless anal intercourse in the previous 6 months (AOR: 5.33, 95%CI: 1.38-20.55). Additionally, exposure to community violence was positively associated with psychological distress, hard drug use, and use of marijuana as a sex drug. Adherence to HIV antiretroviral medication was negatively associated with community violence (AOR: 0.36, 95%CI: 0.13-0.97). Rates of exposure to community violence are especially high in urban communities. Overall findings suggest that treatment, intervention, and programmatic approaches that include initiatives to address exposure to community violence might correlate with better health-related outcomes for HIV-positive YBMSM."
Doc No.13,7457,negative/unlabeled,19.420208,A subset of functional effector-memory CD8+ T lymphocytes in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.,"CD8(+) T cells provide protective immune responses via both cytolytic and non-cytolytic mechanisms in subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In the present study, we investigated the CD28 expression of CD8(+) T cells present in the peripheral blood lymphocyte subset isolated from chronically HIV-infected subjects. Using flow cytometric analysis, a continuous spectrum of CD28 intensity ranging from negative to high, which could be separated into CD28-negative, intermediate (int) and high, was seen for CD8(+) T cells. Our study focused mostly on the CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells. The CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells are CD57(-) CD27(+) CD45RO(+) CD45RA(-) CCR7(low) CD62L(int). The proliferative capacity of CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells was intermediate between those of CD28(-) CD8(+) T cells and CD28(high) CD8(+) T cells. The CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells are specific for HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens as measured by human leucocyte antigen pentamer binding and produce both intracellular interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in response to their cognate viral peptides. The CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells have HIV-specific, CMV-specific and EBV-specific cytotoxic activity in response to their cognate viral peptides. These findings indicate that a subset of functional effector-memory CD8(+) T cells specific for HIV, CMV and EBV antigens may contribute to an efficient immune response in HIV-infected subjects."
Doc No.14,3657,negative/unlabeled,18.96219,"Contribution of CD4+, CD8+CD28+, and CD8+CD28- T cells to CD3+ lymphocyte homeostasis during the natural course of HIV-1 infection.","The relationship between the number of circulating CD4+ T cells and the presence of particular CD8+ T cell subsets was analyzed by flow cytometry on PBL from asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients whose specimens were collected every 2 mo for a total period of 32 mo. Only slight variations were detected in the absolute number of lymphocytes and percentage of CD3+ lymphocytes, whereas both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets showed wide intrapatient variation. Variations in the number of CD8+CD28+ cells paralleled those of the CD4+ T cell subset in each patient tested, while the presence of CD8+CD28- T cells correlated inversely with CD4+ and CD8+CD28+ T cells. These data show that changes in the number of circulating CD4+-and CD8+CD28+ T cells are strongly related to the presence of CD8+CD28- T cells in these patients. Insight into the significance of CD8+CD28- T cell expansion will allow us to understand the mechanisms and significance of the HIV-1- driven change in CD4+CD8+ T cell homeostasis and the basic immunopathology of HIV disease."
Doc No.15,3229,negative/unlabeled,18.780777,Expansion of rare CD8+ CD28- CD11b- T cells with impaired effector functions in HIV-1-infected patients.,"The decline in the number of CD4+ T cells in HIV-1-infected patients is known to be related to the increased number of CD8+CD28- T cells. In this paper, we show that CD8+CD28- T cells from HIV-positive patients have an impaired capability to interact with human endothelial cells. This is due to the dramatic expansion, within this subset, of rare CD11b- cells lacking cell-cell adhesion functions. In 50 HIV-positive patients, 19.5% +/- 6.5% of all T cells were CD8+CD28-CD11b-, whereas only 0.8% +/- 0.4% of all T cells from healthy donors showed this uncommon phenotype. The percentage of circulating CD8+CD28-CD11b- T cells was strongly related to the percentage of CD4+ T cells (r = -0.82). This population is peculiar in terms of HIV infection and was found to possess some characteristics associated with effector functions but its cytotoxic properties were impaired. The percentage of target cells lysed by CD8+CD28-CD11b- was significantly lower than that of cells lysed by its CD11b- counterpart (p <.05) both at low (5:1) or at relatively high (20:1) effector/target ratios. CD8+CD28-CD11b- T cells, which lack the ability to interact with endothelial cells, are likely to accumulate and persist in circulation. The biologic properties of CD8+CD28-CD11b- T cells suggest that these cells might be endstage or aberrant differentiated effector cells. Lack of cell-cell adhesion and impaired cytolytic functions favor the hypothesis of a role for CD8+CD28-CD11b- T cells in the development of immunodeficiency."
Doc No.16,7139,negative/unlabeled,18.583618,Chronic alcohol increases CD8+ T-cell immunosenescence in simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus macaques.,"Activated CD8+ T-cells correlate with viral load and may foretell antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure. HIV infection has been suggested to accelerate immunosenescence through chronic persistent inflammation. Alcohol-use disorders (AUD) are prevalent in persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). We tested the hypothesis that hazardous alcohol consumption accelerates immune activation and immunosenescence. Immune activation and immunosenescence were examined in CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD3+CD4-CD8+) isolated from intestinal biopsies, axillary lymph nodes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of chronic binge alcohol (CBA)-consuming simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected male rhesus macaques with and without antiretroviral therapy (ART; CBA/ART+, CBA/ART-) and in PBMCs isolated from a cohort of PLWHA. Polychromatic flow cytometry was used to phenotype cells isolated from intestinal biopsies, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood from rhesus macaques and PLWHA. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) identified hazardous alcohol drinking in PLWHA. Viral load was determined by RT-qPCR and telomere length was measured using qPCR. PBMC CD8+ T-cell activation (CD38+HLA-DR+) and immunosenescence (CD28-) were increased over baseline levels (857% ± 334, p < 0.05; 398% ± 80, p < 0.05, respectively) only in CBA animals not receiving ART. Viral load correlated with CD8+ T-cell immunosenescence in macaque PBMCs (r(s) = 0.49, p = 0.02). Activated immunosenescent T-cell (CD8+CD38+CD28-) frequencies in PBMCs from PLWHA significantly correlated with AUDIT scores (r(s) = 0.75, p = 0.001), while no correlation was observed with CD4+ T-cell and AUDIT scores (r(s) = -0.24, p = 0.38). Activated immunosenescent T-cells had shorter telomeres than CD8+ T-cells (CD8+CD28+) from PLWHA. Our results suggest that CBA and AUD augment immune activation and immunosenescence in SIV-infected macaques and PLWHA."
Doc No.17,3981,positive/labeled,18.414352,Interest in using mobile technology to help self-manage alcohol use among persons living with the human immunodeficiency virus: A Florida Cohort cross-sectional study.,"Alcohol consumption at hazardous levels is more prevalent and associated with poor health outcomes among persons living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; PLWH). Although PLWH are receptive to using technology to manage health issues, it is unknown whether a cell phone app to self-manage alcohol use would be acceptable among PLWH who drink. The objectives of this study were to determine factors associated with interest in an app to self-manage drinking and to identify differences in baseline mobile technology use among PLWH by drinking level."
Doc No.18,6429,negative/unlabeled,18.295326,Expression of CD28 and CD38 by CD8+ T lymphocytes in HIV-1 infection correlates with markers of disease severity and changes towards normalization under treatment. The Swiss HIV Cohort Study.,"The relationship between blood CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets, as defined by CD28 and CD38 expression, and plasma viraemia and CD4+ T cells in HIV-1 infection was investigated. In a cross-sectional study of 46 patients with either no or stable anti-retroviral treatment, there was a strong negative correlation between the percentage of CD8+CD28- and the percentage of CD4+ T cells (r = -0.75, P < 0.0001), and a positive correlation between absolute numbers of CD8+CD28+ and CD4+ T cells (r = 0.56, P < 0.0001). In contrast, the expression of CD38 by CD8+ T lymphocytes correlated primarily with plasma viraemia (e.g. the percentage of CD38+ in CD8bright cells, r = 0.76, P < 0.0001). In the 6 months following triple therapy initiation in 32 subjects, there was a close correlation between changes (delta) in CD8+CD28+ or CD8+CD28- and in CD4+ T cells (e.g. delta % CD8+CD28+ versus delta % CD4+, r = 0.37, P = 0.0002; delta % CD8+CD28- versus delta % CD4+, r = -0.66, P < 0.0001). A marked decline of the number of CD8+ T cells expressing CD38 was also observed. These results suggest the existence of a T cell homeostasis mechanism operating in blood with CD4+ and CD8+CD28+ cells on the one hand, and with CD8+CD28- cells on the other. In addition, the percentage of CD38+ cells in CD8+ cells, generally considered an independent prognostic factor, could merely reflect plasma viral load."
Doc No.19,1034,negative/unlabeled,18.19814,Genetic variation in the CCL18-CCL3-CCL4 chemokine gene cluster influences HIV Type 1 transmission and AIDS disease progression.,"CCL3 (MIP-1 alpha), CCL4 (MIP-1 beta), and CCL18 (DC-CK1/PARC/AMAC-1) are potent chemoattractants produced by macrophages, natural killer cells, fibroblasts, mast cells, CD4(+) T cells, and CD8(+) T cells. CCL3 and CCL4 are natural ligands for the primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor CCR5 and are also known to activate and enhance the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells. Genomic DNAs from >3,000 participants enrolled in five United States-based natural-history cohorts with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were genotyped for 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 47-kb interval on chromosome 17q12 containing the genes CCL3, CCL4, and CCL18. All 21 SNPs were polymorphic in African Americans (AAs), whereas 7 of the 21 had minor-allele frequencies <0.01 in European Americans (EAs). Substantial linkage disequilibrium was observed in a 37-kb interval containing 17 SNPs where many pairwise D' values exceeded 0.70 in both racial groups, but particularly in EAs. Four and three haplotype blocks were observed in AAs and EAs, respectively. Blocks were strongly correlated with each other, and common haplotype diversity within blocks was limited. Two significant associations are reported that replicate an earlier study. First, among AA members of the AIDS Link to the Intravenous Experience cohort of injection drug users, frequencies of three correlated SNPs covering 2,231 bp in CCL3 were significantly elevated among highly exposed, persistently HIV-1-uninfected individuals compared with HIV-1-infected seroconvertors (P = .02-.03). Second, seven highly correlated SNPs spanning 36 kb and containing all three genes were significantly associated with more-rapid disease progression among EAs enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study cohort (P = .01-.02). These results reiterate the importance of chemokine gene variation in HIV-1/AIDS pathogenesis and emphasize that localized linkage disequilibrium makes the identification of causal mutations difficult."
Doc No.20,593,positive/labeled,18.187586,Substance use and mental health correlates of nonadherence to antiretroviral medications in a sample of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"Mental health and substance use problems are common among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and may impede adherence to antiretroviral regimens. This study investigated associations of antiretroviral medication nonadherence with specific types of psychiatric disorders and drug use, and varying levels of alcohol use."
Doc No.21,1764,positive/labeled,18.093996,"Immune activation, immunosenescence, and osteoprotegerin as markers of endothelial dysfunction in subclinical HIV-associated atherosclerosis.","HIV-infected patients have a significantly greater risk of cardiovascular disease. Several markers including osteoprotegerin have been shown to be involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. We investigated the relationship between T-cell phenotype, osteoprotegerin, and atherosclerosis evaluated by carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT) in 94 HIV+ patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy with Framingham score <10%. As for the control group, 24 HIV-negative subjects were enrolled. c-IMT was assessed by ultrasound. CD4+/CD8+ T-cell activation (CD38+ HLADR+) and senescence (CD57+ CD28-) were measured by flow cytometry. IL-6 and OPG levels were measured by ELISA kit. c-IMT was higher in HIV+ than in controls. Among HIV+ patients, 44.7% had pathological c-IMT (≥0.9 mm). CD8+ T-cell activation and senescence and OPG plasma levels were higher in HIV+ patients than in controls. Subjects with pathological c-IMT exhibited higher CD8+ immune activation and immunosenescence and OPG levels than subjects with normal c-IMT. Multivariate analysis showed that age, CD8+ CD38+ HLADR+, and CD8+ CD28- CD57+ were independently associated with pathological c-IMT. Several factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in HIV patients. Immune activation and immunosenescence of CD8+ T cell together with OPG plasma levels might be associated with the development and progression of early atherosclerosis, even in the case of viral suppression."
Doc No.22,5080,negative/unlabeled,18.062147,What is new in HIV infection?,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and treatment updates include screening recommendations, fourth-generation testing, preexposure prophylaxis, and a paradigm shift; treatment is prevention. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends routine HIV screening in persons 15 to 65 years of age, regardless of risk. Fourth-generation testing is replacing the Western blot and can identify those with acute HIV infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test; however, there are concerns about reduced sensitivity, possible misinterpretation of results, potential for less effective counseling, and possible cost barriers. Preexposure prophylaxis (effective in select high-risk adult populations) is the combination of safer sex practices and continuous primary care prevention services, plus combination antiretroviral therapy. Concerns for preexposure prophylaxis include the necessity of strict medication adherence, limited use among high-risk populations, and community misconceptions of appropriate use. Evidence supports combination antiretroviral therapy as prevention for acute HIV infection, thus lowering community viral loads. Evidence has increased supporting combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment at any CD4 cell count. Resistance testing should guide therapy in all patients on entry into care. Within two weeks of diagnosis of most opportunistic infections, combination antiretroviral therapy should be started; patients with tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis require special considerations."
Doc No.23,9171,positive/labeled,18.007479,Downregulation of CD28 surface antigen on CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes during HIV-1 infection.,"A progressive significant decrease of CD28 surface antigen expression on CD4+ (mean, 90, 86, 79, 68% in stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively, versus 96% in normals), as well as on CD8+ T lymphocytes (mean, 38, 32, 31, and 29% in stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively, versus 47% in normals) was observed during HIV-1 infection. The increase of cytotoxic/suppressor T cells, in both percentage and absolute numbers, that was observed in almost all HIV-1 patients, was associated with an increase of the CD8+ cells lacking the CD28 surface antigen. The loss of CD28 antigen expression was parallel to the increase of CD38, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, and CD45RO antigen expression on T lymphocytes throughout the disease. Furthermore, a positive significant correlation within the CD4+ but not the CD8+ subset was observed between the percentage of cells lacking the CD28 antigen and the percentage of cells expressing the HLA-DR and CD38 antigens, a finding suggesting that the loss of CD28 antigen expression on CD4+ lymphocytes may be associated with T-lymphocyte activation. Patients treated with zidovudine showed no significant differences in the percentages of either CD4+CD28+ or CD8+CD28+ T-cell subsets when compared to untreated patients. These phenotypic changes may be associated with the functional defects of T lymphocytes in HIV-1 infected individuals."
Doc No.24,4124,negative/unlabeled,17.66123,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication, immune activation, and circulating cytotoxic T cells against uninfected CD4+ T cells.","Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that kill uninfected activated CD4+ T cells can be induced in vitro by stimulating CD8+ T cells with activated autologous CD4+ T cells. Similar CTL have been detected in circulating T cells from human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV)-infected individuals. To define the in vivo correlates of this CTL activity, we studied plasma beta-2 microglobulin and HIV RNA levels, T-lymphocyte subset counts, and expression of CD28 on CD8+ T cells concurrently with circulating CTL activity against uninfected CD4+ T cells in 75 HIV-infected individuals at different stages of disease progression. Mean values of each parameter were compared in subsets of this group of 75 segregated on the basis of this CTL activity. The group with CTL against uninfected activated CD4+ T lymphocytes had more CD8+ T cells, a higher percentage of CD28 CD8+ T cells, and higher plasma levels of HIV RNA and beta-2 microglobulin. CTL against uninfected activated CD4+ T cells were predominantly CD28 and in HIV-infected individuals were associated with immunological or virological evidence of progressive disease. In HIV infection, circulating CTL activity against uninfected activated CD4+ T lymphocytes is associated with immune activation, CD8+ T cell expansion, accumulation of CD28 CD8+ T cells, and inadequate suppression of HIV replication."

Understanding patient medication adherence behaviors and challenges could inform adherence interventions to maximize the individual and prevention benefits of ART. This study assessed recent nonadherence and treatment interruption among 813 HIV-infected adult outpatients in Guangzhou, China. Participants completed a behavioral survey, underwent chart review, and were tested for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Factors associated with suboptimal adherence were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Among 721 HIV-infected adults receiving ART, 18.9% reported recent nonadherence (any missed ART in the past four weeks) and 6.8% reported treatment interruption (four or more weeks of missed ART in the past year). Lower education, living alone, alcohol use, and being on ART one to three years were associated with recent nonadherence. Male gender, lower education, and being on ART one to three years were associated with treatment interruption. ART medication adherence interventions are needed in China that include individualized, long-term adherence plans sensitive to patients' educational and economic situations. These interventions should also consider possible gender disparities in treatment outcomes and address the use of alcohol during ART. Successful ART medication adherence interventions in China can inform other international settings that face similar adherence challenges and disparities."

This paper describes the development of a pilot program in which a combined motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy intervention was used to increase adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and reduce substance use in HIV-infected adults. The main goals of the pilot study were (1) to confirm the ability to recruit HIV-positive substance users taking HAART; (2) to demonstrate the ability to retain participants over the course of an eight-session intervention; and (3) to examine changes in substance use and HAART adherence from pretreatment to posttreatment. Twelve HIV-positive adults with a substance use disorder participated in an 8-week intervention, which consisted of weekly individual sessions with a trained therapist. Results showed that despite the small sample size, there was a significant reduction in substance use from pretreatment to posttreatment. No statistically significant differences were found for changes in HIV medication adherence, but the trends suggest the potential for positive results with a larger sample. Retention for all eight sessions of the treatment was 73.3%. Eighty percent completed the 3-month follow-up assessment. Participants reported high therapeutic alliance reflecting comfort with their therapists and in the treatment. Overall, the pilot demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the treatment. Furthermore, results suggest that this may, in fact, be an effective intervention to reduce substance use and improve HIV medication adherence."
Doc No.27,4849,negative/unlabeled,17.188316,Substance abuse and medication adherence among HIV-positive women with histories of child sexual abuse.,"Substance abuse increases the risks for infections and impairs medication adherence among HIV/AIDS patients. However, little is known about the characteristics of substance abuse and its impact on medication adherence among HIV-positive women with a history of child sexual abuse (CSA). In the present study, 148 HIV-positive women with a history of CSA completed a structured interview assessing CSA severity, psychological status, substance abuse, medication adherence, and sexual decision-making. Severity of CSA was significantly associated with substance use but not with adherence. Participants who had used hard drugs and who had lower self-esteem and adherence self-efficacy reported significantly lower levels of adherence. Additional research on how CSA experiences impact health behaviors is needed to help develop culturally congruent interventions to reduce risk behaviors and facilitate better medication adherence for this vulnerable population."
Doc No.28,1859,negative/unlabeled,16.888542,Human immunodeficiency virus Nef induces rapid internalization of the T-cell coreceptor CD8alphabeta.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Nef is a membrane-associated protein decreasing surface expression of CD4, CD28, and major histocompatibility complex class I on infected cells. We report that Nef strongly down-modulates surface expression of the beta-chain of the CD8alphabeta receptor by accelerated endocytosis, while CD8 alpha-chain expression is less affected. By mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic tail of the CD8 beta-chain, an FMK amino acid motif was shown to be critical for Nef-induced endocytosis. Although independent of CD4, endocytosis of the CD8 beta-chain was abrogated by the same mutations in Nef that affect CD4 down-regulation, suggesting common molecular interactions. The ability to down-regulate the human CD8 beta-chain was conserved in HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239 Nef and required an intact AP-2 complex. The Nef-mediated internalization of receptors, such as CD4, major histocompatibility complex class I, CD28, and CD8alphabeta, may contribute to the subversion of the host immune system and progression towards AIDS."
Doc No.29,3938,negative/unlabeled,16.872082,Characterization of the phenotypic and lymphokine profile associated with strong CD8+ anti-HIV-1 suppressor activity (CASA).,"A panel of 22 CD8+ T cell lines, with a broad range of CD8+ anti-HIV-1 suppressor activity (CASA) were generated from a single patient with HIV-1 infection. CD8+ T cell lines with either strong or weak CASA were examined and compared for cell surface and intracellular markers, constitutive chemokine and lymphokine mRNA levels and inducible lymphokine expression. Strong CASA significantly correlated with CD8+ T cell lines that highly coexpressed the molecule CD28+ (r=0.52, P=0.01) and Ki67+ (r=0.88, P=0.02), with strong CASA CD8+ T cell lines demonstrating significantly higher (P < 0.05) expression of CD8+CD28+ and CD8+Ki67+ compared to those with weak activity. No such correlations or findings were observed for the markers CD38, HLA-DR, CD57 or perforin. The Th1 cytokines were expressed at greater levels than the Th2 cytokines, with strong CASA significantly associated with an increased inducible level of IL-2 production (P=0.05). Constitutive RANTES, IP-10 and I-309 mRNA expression were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated in CD8+ T cell lines exhibiting strong CASA compared to those with weak CASA. There was no significant difference in the mRNA expression of the lymphokines IL-2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, or chemokines MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MCP-1, and Ltn. Strong CASA was therefore associated with rapidly replicating CD8+ T cells of the phenotype CD8+CD28+Ki67+ that expressed greater levels of IL-2 and the ligands RANTES and I-309."
Doc No.30,9205,positive/labeled,16.675077,Adherence to antiretroviral medications and medical care in HIV-infected adults diagnosed with mental and substance abuse disorders.,"This paper examines factors associated with adherence to antiretroviral medications (ARVs) in an HIV-infected population at high risk for non-adherence: individuals living with psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. Data were examined from baseline interviews of a multisite cohort intervention study of 1138 HIV-infected adults with both a psychiatric and substance abuse disorder (based on a structured psychiatric research interview using DSM-IV criteria). The baseline interview documented mental illness and substance use in the past year, mental illness and substance abuse severity, demographics, service utilization in the past three months, general health and HIV-related conditions, self-reported spirituality and self-reported ARV medication use. Among the participants, 62% were prescribed ARVs at baseline (n = 542) and 45% of those on ARVs reported skipping medications in the past three days. Reports of non-adherence were significantly associated with having a detectable viral load (p<.01). The factors associated with non-adherence were current drug and alcohol abuse, increased psychological distress, less attendance at medical appointments, non-adherence to psychiatric medications and lower self-reported spirituality. Increased psychological distress was significantly associated with non-adherence, independent of substance abuse (p<.05). The data suggest that both mental illness and substance use must be addressed in HIV-infected adults living with these co-morbid illnesses to improve adherence to ARVs."
Doc No.31,6514,positive/labeled,16.66883,Alcohol-antiretroviral therapy interactive toxicity beliefs and daily medication adherence and alcohol use among people living with HIV.,"Alcohol-antiretroviral therapy (ART) interactive toxicity beliefs reflect perceived adverse outcomes of mixing alcohol and ART. Previous research has shown a significant relationship between alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and ART non-adherence, over and above other correlates of non-adherence such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)symptoms and frequency of alcohol use. Most past studies have collected data over extended periods and have not determined if alcohol use and missed medications occur at the day-level among people holding interactive toxicity beliefs. Previous daily analyses, however, have been limited by self-reported adherence and relatively short periods of observation. To address these gaps in the literature, men and women living with HIV in Atlanta, GA, were enrolled in a 45-day observational cohort study. Daily alcohol use was collected using two-way interactive text message surveys and daily adherence was collected via the Wisepill device. Fifty-seven participants completed a measure of alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and contributed 2565 days of daily data. Participants who endorsed high levels of interactive toxicity beliefs had significantly more days when they missed doses of medication. Alcohol-antiretroviral toxicity beliefs predicted missing doses of medication on days when participants were drinking and on days when they were not drinking. Multilevel multivariate regressions showed that these toxicity beliefs predicted daily missed doses of medication over and above quantity of alcohol consumed, depression and general medication concerns. This study replicates and extends previous literature and indicates the necessity of addressing alcohol-ART toxicity beliefs within adherence interventions."

Changes in CD8(+) subset distribution were studied in 17 subjects with acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection and in 14 subjects with acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, with combined CD45RO, CD27, and CD28 monoclonal antibodies. A vast expansion of memory-type CD45RO(+)CD27(+)CD8(+) T cells, with high expression of the cell-cycle marker Ki-67, was observed in both infections. Strikingly, CD45RO(+)CD27(+)CD28(-) cells increased >10-fold in acute viral infection and had high Ki-67 expression. In acute EBV infection, a substantial portion of the expanded T cells were EBV-peptide specific. These cells resided mainly in the CD45RO(+)CD27(+) subpopulation, with most in the CD27(+)CD28(-) subpopulation. Content of perforin expression, as a measure of cytotoxic capacity, was relatively low in the CD27(+)CD28(+) T cells and highest in the CD27(-)CD28(-) subpopulation."
Doc No.33,609,negative/unlabeled,16.638445,Prevalence and genetic characterization of Cryptosporidium spp. and Cystoisospora belli in HIV-infected patients.,"Cryptosporidium spp. and Cystoisospora belli are monoxenic protozoa that have been recognized as the causative agents of chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals, especially HIV-infected subjects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of these intestinal protozoa in HIV-positive patients in the Triângulo Mineiro region of Brazil and to correlate the presence of these infections with clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data of the patients. Oocysts were detected in stool samples of 10 (16.9%) of the 59 patients studied, while Cryptosporidium spp. were present in 10.1% (6/59) and C. belli in 6.7% (4/59). The frequency of these parasites was higher among patients with diarrheic syndrome and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts < 200 cells/mm 3 , demonstrating the opportunistic characteristic of these infections. A significant association was observed between the lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy and the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and/or C. belli. Parasitism with Cryptosporidium spp. was more frequent in February and April, the months following the period of high rainfall. The same was not observed for C. belli. Genetic characterization of two isolates led to the identification of Cryptosporidium parvum, one of the main species associated with the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis."

Expanded subsets of CD8(+) cells expressing a particular TCR beta-chain variable region were more commonly identified in HIV-1-infected children than in healthy control subjects (75% vs. 13.5%; P<.0001). Older age and lower percentage of CD4(+) cells were correlated with expansions. Oligoclonal populations occupied 71%-95% of each expanded subset, and predominant clones had high absolute counts. There was evidence of functional differentiation to CD28(-) effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and cells bearing identical TCRs were identified in both CD28(+) and CD28(-) cell populations. HIV-1 specificity was observed for expanded clones. Children with expansions were not more likely to have increased numbers of CD8(+) T cells, a finding consistent with the possibility that the CD8(+) TCR repertoire has limited diversity."
Doc No.35,7306,negative/unlabeled,16.574907,CD28 expression in pediatric human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"Increased apoptosis of lymphocytes represents a key event of immune destruction in HIV infection. In this study it was investigated at which stage of the disease and in which T lymphocyte subpopulation (CD4+ or CD8+) protection against apoptosis may be lost as measured by decreased CD28 expression. In 26 HIV-infected and 20 healthy children, as well as 10 infants exposed to HIV, expression of CD28 and the apoptosis-related marker CD95 was studied by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. According to established Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions, children were divided into three immunologic categories. In the CD8 population, patients in category 1 already showed a markedly decreased mean CD28 (36.2%+/-16.1 SD) and increased CD95 expression (48.8+/-24.1%), compared with the age-matched control group (67.7+/-14.4%, 15.8+/-8.9%). In the CD4 population, mean CD28 and CD95 expression was not altered in category 1 patients. Of the exposed children, the child with the lowest CD28 expression on CD8 cells was determined later to be infected with HIV. Significant immunophenotypical alterations are observed in early stage pediatric HIV infection, which may indicate an early loss of protection against apoptosis in the CD8+ T cell population."
Doc No.36,4120,negative/unlabeled,16.395365,Suppression of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat by CD8+ T cells is dependent on the NFAT-1 element.,"CD8+ T lymphocytes of HIV-1 infected individuals produce a soluble factor that efficiently suppresses HIV-1 replication at the transcriptional level. We show here that the response of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) to mitogenic or Tat-mediated activation is sensitive to the suppressive action of a Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-transformed CD8+ T cell clone from an HIV-infected individual and supernatants from CD8+ T cells of HIV-1-infected asymptomatic subjects (CD4+ > 350/microliters). Mutagenesis of NF kappa B or Sp-1 elements within the LTR resulted in no change in the ability of CD8+ T cell supernatants to inhibit Tat- or mitogen-mediated LTR transcription. However, the response to HIV-1 Tat by a LTR in which the interleukin (IL)-2 homology NFAT-1 region was mutated resulted in almost complete elimination of suppression by CD8+ T cells. This was not observed when the NFAT-1 mutant LTR was activated by mitogen. We have previously shown that gene expression directed by the HIV-1 NF kappa B elements is inhibited by CD8+ cell-derived supernatants (Copeland et al., AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses, 1995;11:1321-1326). Taken together, these observations suggest that mitogenic activation, mediated primarily through the NF kappa B enhancer, is susceptible to CD8-mediated inhibition, however, inhibition of Tat-mediated activation may rely upon a different pathway that is NFAT-1 dependent."
Doc No.37,4806,negative/unlabeled,16.332872,Challenges of adherence management in human immunodeficiency virus pharmacotherapy.,"Medication adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is currently a topic of major importance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome care. HAART has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV infection. Many people with HIV now live active and productive lives, with the disease itself having minimal impact on their lifespan. Unlike treatment for other chronic diseases, achieving the full benefit of HAART requires an extremely high level of adherence to potent antiretroviral combinations that is often difficult to achieve given the high pill burdens, drug interactions and adverse events associated with treatment. In this paper, the present knowledge regarding antiretroviral medication adherence is summarized with a focus on understanding the importance of adherence, the relationship between adherence and treatment response, the challenges and barriers facing patients trying to achieve optimal adherence, reasons for nonadherence, and the current directions and issues relevant to future adherence research."

During the study period, 20 patients remained untreated, and only 6 received more than 6 months of therapy. A significant relationship was found between changes in plasma HIV RNA and changes in the proportion of CD38+CD8+ cells. Conversely, the number of CD4+ T cells lost per year was strongly related to the increase in the proportion of CD28-CD8+ T cells. A strong relationship between mean yearly changes in CD4+ T cell numbers and changes in HIV RNA was also observed. CD4+ T cell changes were associated with changes in both viral load and CD8+ T cell activation. These results provide support for the use of both virologic and immunologic parameters for prognosis and management during HIV infection."

However there is need to evaluate the perceptions of the HIV infected patients towards the use of these cell phones in an effort to better aid in the clinical management of their HIV infection. The objective of this study was therefore to determine the perceptions of HIV infected patients on the use of cell phone text messaging as a tool to support adherence to their ART medication.

This relationship may be moderated by an individual's social network characteristics. Our study sought to examine social network correlates of treatment adherence among HIV-positive men recruited from social service agencies throughout Los Angeles County (N = 150) to inform technology-driven social support interventions for this population. We administered egocentric social network and computer-assisted survey interviews focused on demographic characteristics, health history, depressive symptoms, and ART adherence, where adherence was assessed by the number of reasons participants missed taking their medication, if ever. Significant univariate correlates of adherence were included in a multivariable regression analysis, where the moderating effect of having a network member who reminds participants to take their HIV medication on the relationship between depression and adherence was tested. Over 60% of participants reported clinically significant depressive symptoms; this was significantly associated with lower adherence among those without someone in their social network to remind them about taking their HIV medication, even after adjusting for covariates in an ordinary least squares regression (adjusted mean difference b = -1.61, SE = 0.42, p = 0.0003). Having a network member who reminds participants to take their ART medication significantly ameliorated the negative association between depression and treatment adherence, especially for those reporting greater depressive symptoms (p = 0.0394). Additionally, participants demonstrated high rates of technology use to communicate with social network members. In order to achieve the aims of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, innovative interventions addressing mental health to improve ART adherence are needed. Network strategies that leverage technology may be helpful for improving ART adherence among HIV-positive men with comorbid depressive symptoms."
Doc No.41,746,positive/labeled,16.12286,Testing an optimized community-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk reduction and antiretroviral adherence intervention for HIV-infected injection drug users.,"The authors conducted a preliminary study of the 4-session Holistic Health for HIV (3H+), which was adapted from a 12-session evidence-based risk reduction and antiretroviral adherence intervention. Improvements were found in the behavioral skills required to properly adhere to HIV medication regimens. Enhancements were found in all measured aspects of sex-risk reduction outcomes, including HIV knowledge, motivation to reduce sex-risk behavior, behavioral skills related to engaging in reduced sexual risk, and reduced risk behavior. Improvements in drug use outcomes included enhancements in risk reduction skills as well as reduced heroin and cocaine use. Intervention effects also showed durability from post-intervention to the follow-up assessment point. Females responded particularly well in terms of improvements in risk reduction skills and risk behavior. This study suggests that an evidence-based behavioral intervention may be successfully adapted for use in community-based clinical settings where HIV-infected drug users can be more efficiently reached."

The respondents, with a median age of 41, were predominantly male (86%), white (62%), and highly educated (33% had some post-high school training but no college degree and 39% had a college degree; only 11% had less than a high school diploma). Twenty-one percent had a history of injection drug use, 12% were unemployed, and 18% had Medicaid insurance. Questions about difficulty taking antiretroviral medications or drug holidays identified an additional 16% of patients experiencing adherence problems and explained significantly more of the failure to achieve undetectable viral loads than simply querying about skipped doses."
Doc No.43,8451,negative/unlabeled,16.06277,Dual selection pressure by drugs and HLA class I-restricted immune responses on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease.,"To determine the influence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CD8+ T cells on the development of drug resistance mutations in the HIV-1 protease, we analyzed protease sequences from viruses from a human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA class I)-typed cohort of 94 HIV-1-positive individuals. In univariate statistical analyses (Fisher's exact test), minor and major drug resistance mutations as well as drug-associated polymorphisms showed associations with HLA class I alleles. All correlations with P values of 0.05 or less were considered to be relevant without corrections for multiple tests. A subset of these observed correlations was experimentally validated by enzyme-linked immunospot assays, allowing the definition of 10 new epitopes recognized by CD8+ T cells from patients with the appropriate HLA class I type. Several drug resistance-associated mutations in the protease acted as escape mutations; however, cells from many patients were still able to generate CD8+ T cells targeting the escape mutants. This result presumably indicates the usage of different T-cell receptors by CD8+ T cells targeting these epitopes in these patients. Our results support a fundamental role for HLA class I-restricted immune responses in shaping the sequence of the HIV-1 protease in vivo. This role may have important clinical implications both for the understanding of drug resistance pathways and for the design of therapeutic vaccines targeting drug-resistant HIV-1."

(a) uVL group: 15 children with VL below 400 copies/mL; (b) dVL group: 17 children with higher VL. The uVL group showed higher memory (CD4+CD45RO+) T cells than did dVL group, and higher number of memory activated CD4+CD45RO+HLA-DR+ than did control group (healthy age-matched uninfected children), whereas CD4+CD45RA(hi)+CD62L+ was similar. However, TCR rearrangement excision circles (TRECs) were higher in uVL group than in dVL group. uVL Group showed CD8+CD45RO+ and CD8+CD45RO+CD38- higher number than the control group, but lower than the dVL group. The percentage of CD8+CD45RA(hi)+CD62L+, CD8+CD45RA+, CD8+CD62L-, and CD8+CD28+ was higher in uVL group than in dVL group, and lower than in control group. The uVL group showed higher number of activated (HLA-DR+CD38+, HLA-DR+, HLA-DR+CD38-) CD4+ T cells and lower percentages of CD4+HLA-DR-CD38+ than dVL group. In activated CD8- T cell, the uVL group had lower CD8+HLA-DR+CD38+, CD8+HLA-DR+, and CD8+CD38+ than the dVL group. Preeffector (CD8+CD57-CD28- and CD8+CD45RA-CD62L-) T cells were lower in the uVL group than in dVL group. In the effector (CD8+CD57+, CD8+CD57+CD28-, and CD8+CD45RA+CD62L-) T cells, HIV-infected-children had higher values than control group. HIV-infected-children who respond to HAART had TRECs reconstitution, decreased immune activation, and lower effector CD8+ T cells.

Estimated first- and second-phase decay rates were d1 as 0.47/day and d2 as 0.04/day. Interpatient differences in both decay rates were significant. The d1 was directly correlated with baseline CD4+, CD4+CD28+, and CD8+CD28+ T lymphocyte counts (P<.05) and inversely correlated with baseline virus load (P=.044) and the magnitude of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte recovery (P<.01). The d2 was directly correlated with baseline percentage of CD8+ T lymphocytes (P=.023), the CD8+CD38+ cell number (P=.024), and the level of IgG that binds to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 gp120 (P=.02). Viral decay rates were not predictive of treatment failure or durability of viral suppression. These exploratory findings are consistent with a model in which immunologic factors contribute to elimination of HIV-infected cells and suggest a dynamic interplay between regulation of HIV expression and lymphocyte activation and recovery."

We prospectively assessed adherence to antiretroviral therapy regimens among 31 HIV-infected prison inmates who were receiving >or=1 antiretrovirals via DOT. Adherence was measured by self-report, pill count, electronic monitoring caps, and, for DOT only, medication administration records. Overall, median adherence was 90%, as measured by pill count; 86%, by electronic monitoring caps; and 100%, by self-report. Adherence, as measured by electronic monitoring caps, was >90% in 32% of the subjects. In 91% of cases, adherence, as measured by medication administration records, was greater than that recorded by electronic monitoring caps for the same medications administered by DOT. Objective methods of measurement revealed that adherence to antiretroviral regimens administered wholly or in part by DOT was <or=90% in more than one-half of the patients. Different methods used to measure adherence revealed significantly different levels of adherence. These findings suggest that use of DOT does not ensure adherence to antiretroviral therapy."
Doc No.47,7720,negative/unlabeled,15.735481,Predictors of antiretroviral adherence.,"This study was conducted in order to help determine the key factors that predict adherence to antiretroviral medications. A total of 115 HIV/AIDS patients who were having trouble adhering to their antiretroviral regimens completed face-to-face interviews in which adherence levels, medication side effects, mental health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics, substance use and health anxiety were assessed. Three measures of adherence were used: adherence over the past three days, adherence over the past week, and adherence over the past month. Logistic regression analyses indicated strongest prediction of three-day adherence, with mental health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics and side effects contributing to prediction. Past week adherence was associated with age and social support measures, and showed a marginal association with side effects. Past month adherence was less strongly predicted, with social support and alcohol use contributing to prediction. Thus, a variety of factors were found to determine adherence, and implications of the findings for adherence models and interventions are discussed."
Doc No.48,1303,negative/unlabeled,15.713594,Requesting help to understand medical information among people living with HIV and poor health literacy.,"Health literacy is known to influence medication adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS. People who experience difficulty reading health information may benefit from asking others to assist them with reading, interpreting, and understanding medical information. We examined medical chart-abstracted HIV viral load, medication adherence assessed by unannounced pill counts, and adherence improvement strategies among 245 individuals with lower-health literacy who do not request assistance, and 229 who do request assistance with reading and understanding health information. Participants were people living with HIV who were taking antiretroviral therapy and scored below 90% correct on a standardized test of functional health literacy. After controlling for health literacy scores, requesting informational assistance was associated with strategies used to improve adherence; individuals who asked for assistance were significantly more likely to use multiple adherence strategies. However, despite requesting informational assistance and using more adherence strategies, participants who requested informational assistance evidenced poorer treatment adherence and poorer suppression of HIV replication. Requesting assistance was more common among those with the poorest health literacy and therefore greatest challenges to adherence.

However, it is well known that human CD8(+) T cells cannot differentiate into effector cells in immunodeficient mice transplanted with only human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), because human T cells are not educated by HLA in the mouse thymus. We here established HLA-B*51:01 transgenic humanized mice by transplanting human CD34(+) HSCs into HLA-B*51:01 transgenic NOD/SCID/Jak3(-/-) mice (hNOK/B51Tg mice) and investigated whether human effector CD8(+) T cells would be elicited in the mice or in those infected with HIV-1 NL4-3. There were no differences in the frequency of late effector memory and effector subsets (CD27(low)CD28(-)CD45RA(+/-)CCR7(-) and CD27(-)CD28(-)CD45RA(+/-)CCR7(-), respectively) among human CD8(+) T cells and in that of human CD8(+) T cells expressing CX3CR1 and/or CXCR1 between hNOK/B51Tg and hNOK mice. In contrast, the frequency of late effector memory and effector CD8(+) T cell subsets and of those expressing CX3CR1 and/or CXCR1 was significantly higher in HIV-1-infected hNOK/B51Tg mice than in uninfected ones, whereas there was no difference in that of these subsets between HIV-1-infected and uninfected hNOK mice. These results suggest that hNOK/B51Tg mice had CD8(+) T cells that were capable of differentiating into effector T cells after viral antigen stimulation and had a greater ability to elicit effector CD8(+) T cells than hNOK ones."

The expression characteristics of the CD28 family of receptors, the effects of PD‑1 blockade on the receptor expression profiles and the levels of interferon (IFN)‑γ were investigated in the T cells of patients with CHB. In addition, the transcription factor, T‑box 21 (T‑bet) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA‑3) mRNA expression levels were investigated in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with CHB. The expression levels of the CD28 family receptors in the T cells of patients with CHB demonstrated distinct characteristics , for example levels of PD‑1 and CTLA‑4 on CD4 T cells and ICOS, PD‑1, and BTLA on CD8 T cells were increased in cells from patients with CHB compared with those from the healthy individuals. A significant positive correlation was demonstrated among the serum HBV DNA titers and the levels of PD‑1 on CD8+ T cells with the highest expression of PD‑1 corresponding to viral levels >106 IU/ml. A significant positive correlation was observed between the serum HBV DNA titers and the expression levels of BTLA on CD8+ T cells with the highest expression of BTLA corresponding to viral levels >106 IU/ml. PD‑1 blockade altered the expression profiles of CD28 family receptors in the T cells of patients with CHB, partly enhanced T cell function and increased the ratio of T‑bet/GATA‑3 mRNA in PBMCs. Thus, CD28 family receptors are potential clinical indicators for the rapid monitoring of changes in T cell function during CHB treatment. Furthermore, PD‑1 blockade has a therapeutic potential that may be enhanced by modulating the expression of co-stimulatory and -inhibitory receptors of the CD28 family. "

We studied the effect of current standard therapy (2 nucleoside analogues and a protease inhibitor) in 16 patients with symptomatic PHI. In the 13 patients who completed 1 year of treatment, plasma HIV RNA was <50 copies/mL and median CD4 cell counts were comparable to HIV-uninfected controls, with naive (CD45RA+CD62L+), primed (CD45RO+), and T cell receptor Vbeta subsets all within normal ranges. However, HIV-1 DNA levels in treated and untreated PHI patients were similar. Furthermore, CD8 cell counts remained elevated, including activated (CD38+HLA-DR+), replicating (Ki-67+), and cytotoxic (perforin+CD28-) lymphocytes. In conclusion, early antiretroviral therapy resulted in clearance of viremia and prevented loss of crucial CD4 subsets. The persistence of HIV-1 DNA together with increased CD8 T lymphocyte turnover and activation indicate continued expression of viral antigens."
Doc No.52,271,negative/unlabeled,15.527133,Dynamics of T cells subsets and lymphoproliferative responses during structured treatment interruption cycles and after definitive interruption of HAART in early chronic HIV type-1-infected patients.,"Little is known about the consequences of short cycles of structured treatment interruption or definitive interruption of HAART for both T cell subset dynamics and T lymphoproliferative responses (LPR). Immunological follow-up was performed in 45 early chronical HIV-1-infected patients during short STI cycles during the first 12 weeks after the definitive interruption of HAART (DTI) and, thereafter, until VL reached a plateau. During STI cycles, CD8(+), CD8(+), CD28(+), activation markers and naive CD4(+) T cells increased significantly (p < 0.0001), while both naive CD8(+) and memory CD4(+) T cells decreased. During DTI, CD8(+) CD28(+) T cells fell and CD4(+) naive T cells stabilized and the rest of the T cell subsets presented changes similar to those during STI cycles. Despite a transient increase in LPR to recall antigens and HIV proteins during STI cycles, LPR to polyclonal stimuli and pathogens decreased over the study. Differences in T cell subset dynamics and LPR observed throughout the study suggest that multiple exposures to low levels of antigen could improve the immune system, mainly by driving T cell maturation. Conversely, higher and longer viral replication after cessation of HAART overwhelms the immune system. These data may help to guide future immune-based therapies."
Doc No.53,540,negative/unlabeled,15.494176,A decade of viral mutations and associated drug resistance in a population of HIV-1+ Puerto Ricans: 2002-2011.,"Puerto Rico has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS seen for any US state or territory, and antiretroviral therapy has been a mainstay of efforts to mitigate the HIV/AIDS public health burden on the island. We studied the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 mutation and antiretroviral drug resistance in Puerto Rico by monitoring the population frequency of resistance-associated mutations from 2002 to 2011. Whole blood samples from 4,475 patients were analyzed using the TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit and OpenGene DNA Sequencing System in the Immunoretrovirus Research Laboratory at Universidad Central del Caribe. Results show that 64.0% of female and 62.9% of male patients had HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to at least one antiretroviral medication. L63P and M184V were the dominant mutations observed for the protease (PRO) and reverse transcriptase (RT) encoding genes, respectively. Specific resistance mutations, along with their associated drug resistance profiles, can be seen to form temporal clusters that reveal a steadily changing landscape of resistance trends over time. Both women and men showed resistance mutations for an average of 4.8 drugs over the 10-year period, further underscoring the strong selective pressure exerted by antiretrovirals along with the rapid adaptive response of HIV. Nevertheless, both female and male patients showed a precipitous decrease for overall drug resistance, and for PRO mutations in particular, over the entire course of the study, with the most rapid decrease in frequency seen after 2006. The reduced HIV-1 mutation and drug resistance trends that we observed are consistent with previous reports from multi-year studies conducted around the world. Reduced resistance can be attributed to the use of more efficacious antiretroviral drug therapy, including the introduction of multi-drug combination therapies, which limited the ability of the virus to mount rapid adaptive responses to antiretroviral selection pressure."
Doc No.54,2509,negative/unlabeled,15.432108,Suppression of activation of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat by CD8+ T cells is not lentivirus specific.,"CD8+ T lymphocytes of HIV-1-infected individuals can efficiently suppress HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T lymphocytes. To elucidate the molecular events underlying this suppression, we have used the HIV-1 LTR directing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT) in transient transfection assays using human Jurkat T cells. In addition to supernatants of patient CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD4+ > 350/microliters), supernatant of a T cell clone derived by Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-mediated transformation of CD8+ T lymphocytes of a patient demonstrating inhibition of virus replication were examined. Similar levels of inhibition of LTR-mediated gene expression in response to Tat or mitogenic activation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore were observed by supernatants of both sources. The inhibitory effect of CD8+ T lymphocytes was not exclusive to lentiviral LTRs since transcription of both the HTLV-I LTR and RSV LTR in response to mitogen was effectively inhibited. In examination of the influence of CD8+ T cell-derived supernatant on NF kappa B-mediated activation, a dimer of the HIV-1 NF kappa B elements directing CAT was markedly inhibited by supernatants of both patient CD8+ lymphocytes and the HVS-derived CD8+ clone. Thus the inhibitory nature of CD8+ T lymphocytes appears not to be specific to lentiviral promoters and may mediate an inhibitory effect via the NF kappa B element."
Doc No.55,2104,positive/labeled,15.406669,Association of individual and systemic barriers to optimal medical care in people living with HIV/AIDS in Miami-Dade County.,"Barriers to retention in HIV care are detrimental to patients' progress along the HIV continuum of care. Previous literature has focused on individual, client-level barriers, and interventions to address them. In contrast, less work has examined the role of system-level barriers on HIV care outcomes. This study seeks to understand how individual and systemic barriers individually are associated with clinic appointment attendance and virologic suppression in HIV-infected patients attending the largest HIV clinic in Miami-Dade, FL. In addition, we examined the synergistic effects of these barriers as potential syndemic factors on these health outcomes. Barriers to clinic attendance were determined in a face-to-face study interview with 444 HIV-infected outpatients (187 regular attenders, 191 irregular attenders, and 66 nonattenders) identified from electronic medical records. Compared with the other attendance groups, nonattenders had higher viral loads, were less likely to be virologically suppressed, had lower CD4 counts, had higher depressive symptoms, life chaos, lower quality of life, and higher rates of food insecurity, and recent drug use. Additionally, nonattenders compared with regular attenders had lower physician relationship ratings, had lower medical information clarity and more often reported transportation as a barrier to clinic attendance. When viewed as a syndemic, compared with patients not reporting any barriers, patients with 3 or more individual-level barriers were more likely to have a detectable viral load (odds ratio = 3.60, 95% CI: 1.71 to 7.61). Our findings suggest that patients presenting to the clinic with multiple barriers should be prioritized for assistance and future interventions to improve retention in care. Interventions should address multiple individual and system-level barriers simultaneously with particular attention to addressing depressive symptoms, organizational skills, relationship with the physician, and HIV-related health education.

We examined medication adherence among 44 HIV+/BD+ persons as compared to 33 demographically- and medically-comparable HIV+/BD- persons. Classification of adherent (≥ 90%) or non-adherent (<90%) based on proportion of correctly taken doses over 30 days was determined using electronic medication monitoring devices. HIV+/BD+ persons were significantly less likely to be ART adherent (47.7%) as compared to HIV+/BD- (90.9%) persons. Within the HIV+/BD+ group, mean psychiatric medication adherence was significantly worse than ART medication adherence, although there was a significant correlation between ART and psychiatric adherence levels. Importantly, 30-day ART adherence was associated with plasma virologic response among HIV+/BD+ individuals. Given the high overlap of HIV and BD, and the observed medication adherence difficulties for these persons, specialized adherence improvement interventions are needed."
Doc No.57,1120,positive/labeled,15.23633,A low level of CD4+CD28+ T cells is an independent predictor of high mortality in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected patients.,"This study investigated coexpression of CD28, CD45RA, and CD45RO on CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells in 107 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected patients, who were followed-up prospectively and were not treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy, and 65 control subjects. The most important novel finding was that a 50% reduction in CD4(+)CD28(+) cells predicted increased mortality (relative hazards [HR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.6; P=.04), even after adjusting for the CD4(+) cell counts, virus load, beta(2)-microglobulin and hemoglobin levels, and HIV disease stage. Patients with progressed HIV infection had decreased concentrations of all studied cell subsets. Concerning the proportions of cells, only CD4(+)CD28(+), CD4(+)CD45RA(+), and CD8(+)CD45RO(+) cells decreased with HIV progression. Low proportions of CD4(+)CD45RA(+), CD8(+)CD45RA(+), and CD8(+)CD45RO(+) cells predicted mortality only in univariate but not in multivariate Cox analyses. If our results are confirmed in other studies, coexpression of CD28 on CD4(+) cells may be a useful marker to evaluate HIV progression."
Doc No.58,29,negative/unlabeled,15.202506,Early changes in peripheral blood T cell subsets induced by antiretroviral treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 positive individuals.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection causes a gradual decline in peripheral blood CD4+ T cells. Shortly after the primary infection, an expansion of the activated memory CD8+ T-cell pool is also observed paralleling increased levels of plasma viraemia. In the present study we investigated the immediate effects of zidovudine therapy on peripheral blood T-cell subsets during the first 3 weeks of therapy in a group of HIV-1 positive individuals receiving influenza vaccine. HIV-1 positive individuals who received vaccine, but no treatment, were included as controls. Both the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased during the first week of therapy in parallel with a decline in plasma viraemia. The majority of CD4+ T cells contributing to this expansion expressed CD28, CD45RO and Fas, whereas the expanded CD8+ T cells were predominantly CD28-, CD45RO+, CD38+, Fas+ and Fas+ (CD95). We propose that the increase in the number of activated memory T cells observed in peripheral blood immediately after the onset of antiretroviral treatment is most likely caused by the redistribution of cells from various lymphoid organs in response to decreased levels of viral load in these compartments. The degree of T-cell redistribution is probably dependent on the magnitude of virus suppression."

The Langerin protein, found at the surface of Langerhans cells, has an important protective role in HIV-1 infection. Differences in Langerin function due to host genetic factors could influence susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. To verify the frequency of mutations in the Langerin gene, 118 samples from HIV-1-infected women and 99 samples from HIV-1-uninfected individuals were selected for sequencing of the promoter and carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD)-encoding regions of the Langerin gene. Langerin promoter analysis revealed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one mutation in both studied groups, which created new binding sites for certain transcription factors, such as NFAT5, HOXB9.01 and STAT6.01, according to MatInspector software analysis. Three SNPs were observed in the CRD-encoding region in HIV-1-infected and uninfected individuals: p.K313I, c.941C>T and c.983C>T. This study shows that mutations in the Langerin gene are present in the analysed populations at different genotypic and allelic frequencies. Further studies should be conducted to verify the role of these mutations in HIV-1 susceptibility. "
Doc No.60,398,negative/unlabeled,15.085359,Association of unmet needs for support services with medication use and adherence among HIV-infected individuals in the southeastern United States.,"Unmet needs for services, such as housing and psychiatric treatment, are relatively common among HIV-infected individuals; however, the effects of different types of unmet needs on health-care outcomes are not well understood. This study describes unmet psychosocial needs and their relationship with health-care outcomes among individuals receiving HIV care in the southeastern US (n=526). We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association of seven categories of unmet needs with HIV medication use and adherence. Most participants (84.5%) reported at least one service need in the past year. Nearly half (47%) of participants with service needs reported that at least one need was not met. Participants with one or more unmet needs were less likely to be taking any HIV medications (p = 0.007) and reported poorer medication adherence (p=0.013). The specific unmet needs for benefits (including Social Security, health insurance and prescription coverage) (p = 0.006) and a support group (p=0.040) were associated with being less likely to be taking any HIV medications. Unmet need for mental health-related counseling was associated with poorer medication adherence (p=0.003). Study findings regarding the high level of unmet need and the association of unmet need with poorer outcomes illustrate the importance of interventions to address these needs."

Understanding the barriers and facilitators of adherence is invaluable for programme improvement, which assists the foundation of adherence intervention strategies. A qualitative study was conducted in six selected hospitals of Addis Ababa in 2008, to explore barriers and facilitators to antiretroviral medication adherence among HIV-infected paediatric patients. Twelve caregivers of adherent and non-adherent children and 14 key informants in five hospitals were included in the study. The findings revealed that over-dosage (heavy pill burden), fear of stigma and discrimination, cost and access to transportation, lack of understanding of the benefit of taking the medication, economic problems in the household, and lack of nutritional support were the barriers to adherence to HAART. The presence of mobile/wall alarm, the presence of follow-up counselling, improved health of the child, ART clinic setups, and disclosure of HIV serostatus were among the facilitators. This study indicated that paediatric adherence to antiretroviral therapy faces a huge challenge. It suggests the provision of income-generating schemes to caregivers for assisting HIV-infected children. Health care providers should address proper usage of medication reminders."
Doc No.62,7798,negative/unlabeled,14.929509,Evidence for intact costimulation via CD28 and CD27 molecules in hyporesponsive T cells from human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals.,"In the activation of T cells, the primary signal is antigen-specific and given through T cell receptor (TcR)/CD3 ligation. Furthermore, costimulatory molecules such as CD28 and CD27, provide an essential signal for activation through interaction with their ligands, present on the membrane of antigen-presenting cells. During asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, T cell function is progressively lost. Here, we investigated whether in the presence of impaired responses of T cells from HIV-infected individuals to signal one, costimulation through CD28 and CD27 after interaction with their natural ligands CD80 and CD70 is intact. T cell proliferative responses to signal one in combination with CD80 or CD70 were decreased in a large fraction of asymptomatically HIV-infected individuals. This was due to impaired responses of signal one but not to impaired responses to costimulation, since CD80 or CD70 did enhance signal one-mediated proliferative responses to a normal extent. Moreover, in individuals with proliferative responses to signal one that were decreased to 50% of normal T cell responses, costimulation even was increased compared to controls. Our results demonstrate that in HIV-infected individuals the response to costimulation is relatively preserved compared to responses to the first signal and point to the defect in T cells in HIV infection being primarily in the CD3/TcR-mediated pathway."

Coping styles were hypothesized to mediate the link between acculturation and health risk behaviors for HIV positive Latinas. Structural equation modeling revealed that greater acculturation was related to less positive coping and more negative coping. In turn, negative coping was associated with more health risk behaviors and more non-adherence. Positive coping was associated with less substance use as reflected in use of cigarettes and alcohol and less non-adherence. Coping styles mediated the relationship between acculturation and health risk behaviors. Findings echo previous works examining the Hispanic Health Paradox wherein more acculturated Latinos exhibit increased risk behavior and maladaptive coping styles. HIV/AIDS interventions need to be mindful of cultural differences within Hispanic populations and be tailored to address these differences."

During primary infection (day 14) of this rhesus macaque with the pathogenic SIVmac251 strain, proviruses were detected at similar frequencies in CD4(+) CD8(+) T cells (1/10) and CD4(+) T cells (1/10) and at a lower frequency in CD8(+) T cells (1/800). On day 235, no viral DNA was detected in CD8(+) cells, despite the persistent high viral load, indicating that CD8(+) cells do not constitute a reservoir during the chronic phase of SIV infection. Infection induced early lymphopenia of CD4(+), CD4(+) CD8(+), and CD8(+) cells; only the CD8(+) cell population returned to initial levels and expanded further. We found that CD4(+) CD8(+) T cells expressed the costimulatory CD28 molecule less and were more prone to die in vitro after phytohemagglutinin/interleukin 2 stimulation than were CD4(+) T cells. Taken together, massive death of CD4(+) CD8(+) T cells during acute stages of SIV infection may explain why CD8(+) T cells did not represent a major reservoir for SIV at the onset of infection."
Doc No.65,6383,positive/labeled,14.674693,A pilot study of the effects of a behavioural intervention on treatment adherence in HIV-infected patients.,"A pilot study was carried out in a group of six HIV-infected non-adherent men testing the effects of a behavioural medication management intervention on adherence with antiretroviral drugs. The study was prospective, using a one-group repeated-measures design. Adherence was measured using two self-reports. The intervention was a behaviourally-based programme that lasted for three months and included individualized education about antiretroviral medication and their side effects; positive reinforcement and encouragement; individualized counselling weekly; follow-up calls; and lifestyle assessment and the identification of adherence barriers. Assessments were carried out at recruitment, immediately after the initiation of the intervention, one month, three months and six months later. Results suggested that the intervention enhanced adherence rates from a mean percentage of 80.27 at baseline to a mean of 97.5% at the end of follow-up (six months time point). Similar improvement was observed in the scores of the scale measuring adherence difficulties. Further, CD4+ counts also slightly improved. Interviews with four of the participants at the end of the study highlighted the problems experienced by patients in taking their medication and supported the usefulness of the intervention. Because of the complexity of the factors behind adherence, it is important that patients are supported with individualized medication management programmes."
Doc No.66,2169,positive/labeled,14.6538725,Multidisciplinary HIV adherence intervention: a randomized study.,"Maintaining greater than 95% adherence to antiretroviral medication is necessary in order to have the greatest therapeutic impact on HIV infection. Furthermore, evidence suggests that adherence rates of between 70% and 89% are significantly associated with viral rebound and the development of drug resistance. Adherence rates at and above the 95% level are difficult for patients to achieve and maintain. Our aim was to determine if an adherence intervention could improve adherence among patients attending an ambulatory care clinic at a large public hospital. The intervention was delivered by a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals and consisted of education coupled with the provision of devices designed to assist patient memory and adherence. A crucial component of the intervention consisted of the identification of patient specific barriers to adherence and the development of strategies to circumvent these problems. Adherence was assessed using patient self-report over the past 4, 7, and 28 days and by calculation of the Morisky score. The study was conducted as a randomised controlled trial using the stepped wedge design with a total of 68 subjects randomised to receive the intervention over a 20-week period. Adherence before and after the intervention formed the analysis. There was a significant decrease in the number of missed doses over the past 4 (1.9 to 1.0, p < 0.001), 7 (3.0 to 1.8, p < 0.001) and 28 (7.4 to 4.2, p < 0.001) days and a decrease in the Morisky score, indicating an improvement in medication taking behaviour (1.3 to 0.5 p < 0.001)."
Doc No.67,2301,negative/unlabeled,14.640142,Hepatitis B virus resistance to nucleos(t)ide analogues.,"Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can be successfully treated using nucleos(t)ide analogs (NA), but drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants frequently arise, leading to treatment failure and progression to liver disease. There has been much research into the mechanisms of resistance to NA and selection of these mutants. Five NA have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of CHB; it is unlikely that any more NA will be developed in the near future, so it is important to better understand mechanisms of cross-resistance (when a mutation that mediates resistance to one NA also confers resistance to another) and design more effective therapeutic strategies for these 5 agents. The genes that encode the polymerase and envelope proteins of HBV overlap, so resistance mutations in polymerase usually affect the hepatitis B surface antigen; these alterations affect infectivity, vaccine efficacy, pathogenesis of liver disease, and transmission throughout the population. Associations between HBV genotype and resistance phenotype have allowed cross-resistance profiles to be determined for many commonly detected mutants, so genotyping assays can be used to adapt therapy. Patients that experience virologic breakthrough or partial response to their primary therapy can often be successfully treated with a second NA, if this drug is given at early stages of these events. However, best strategies for preventing NA resistance include first-line use of the most potent antivirals with a high barrier to resistance. It is important to continue basic research into HBV replication and pathogenic mechanisms to identify new therapeutic targets, develop novel antiviral agents, design combination therapies that prevent drug resistance, and decrease the incidence of complications of CHB."
Doc No.68,2102,positive/labeled,14.639189,Improving adherence and clinical outcomes through an HIV pharmacist's interventions.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive individuals who adhere to their antiretroviral (ARV) regimens are more likely to achieve suppressed HIV viral load and improved immunologic response; however, for most patients, medication adherence remains a challenge. Prior studies have shown that clinical pharmacists contribute to the management of HIV-infected patients; but due to variability in clinical responsibilities and study limitations, their value has not been fully realized. The objective of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes of an HIV clinical pharmacist's interventions at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, who utilizes medication expertise to provide recommendations for ARV regimen changes. The pharmacist suggests new ARV regimens in order to attain virologic suppression, improve immunologic response, or minimize ARV adverse effects, while aiming to optimize patients' adherence by decreasing pill burden and/or dosing frequency. This retrospective study assessed the effectiveness of the pharmacist's interventions that occurred between 11 September 2006 and 30 September 2008 on pill burden, dosing frequency, and medication adherence. Additionally, CD4+ cell count and HIV viral load pre- and post-intervention were evaluated. Medication adherence was assessed utilizing electronic pharmacy refill records and calculated based on the formula: [(pills dispensed/pills prescribed per day)/days between refills] x 100. From a cohort of 75 patients, mean daily pill quantity and dosing frequency decreased from 7.2 pills/day and 2.0 times/day in the control phase to 5.4 pills/day and 1.5 times/day in the study phase, respectively ( p < 0.001). Medication adherence increased from a mean of 81% in the control phase to 89% in the study phase ( p = 0.003). Clinical outcomes measured by CD4+cell count and CD4% were statistically improved and more individuals achieved undetectable HIV viral loads postintervention ( p < 0.001). In conclusion, HIV clinical pharmacists may play an important role in reducing pill burden and dosing frequency, increasing medication adherence, and improving clinical outcomes."
Doc No.69,2722,negative/unlabeled,14.495714,Effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy and immune recovery on CD8+ T-cell-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 transcription.,": To date, the relation between the CD8 antiviral factor (CAF) and clinical indicators of disease progression in HIV-1 infection (CD4 T-cell counts and viral load [VL]) is inconclusive. Particularly, the effect of antiretroviral therapy and immune recovery on CAF production remains unclear. Using a transient transfection assay and a reporter gene activated by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), we analyzed CAF production in CD8 T cells of HIV-1-positive individuals divided into 3 groups: patients on protease inhibitor (PI)-based therapy, patients on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapy, and patients receiving no therapy. We found that within the untreated group, CAF activity inversely correlated with VL and high CAF was associated with lower VLs over a period of 0.5 to 3 years. Furthermore, patients who were drug-naive demonstrated significantly higher CAF than untreated patients who had previously undergone antiretroviral therapy. CAF activity in treated patients was similar to CAF in drug-naive patients and higher than in off-treatment patients. There seemed to be a trend toward higher CAF in patients on NNRTI-based therapy compared with those on PI-based therapy. These results suggest that immune recovery after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) contributes to the normalization of CAF levels in HIV-1-positive individuals. Furthermore, we have distinguished between CD8 T-cell-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication and gene transcription."

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was reported to restore malfunctioning immunologic regulatory components. To corroborate this hypothesis, we studied different dendritic-cell (DC) and T-cell subsets with regulatory phenotype in 41 clinically stable patients with hemophilia more than 25 years after infection with HIV and 10 years after initiation of HAART. Compared with healthy controls, patients showed normal DC1 and DC2 levels, increased CD8 peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) counts and T helper (Th) 2 proportions, and decreased Th1, CD3CD4CD127, and CD3CD8CD127 PBL proportions. High viral load was associated with high DC1, whereas high CD8 PBL counts were associated with low DC2. CD3CD4CD25Foxp3 (regulatory T [Treg] cell) and CD3CD8CD28Foxp3 PBL counts (suppressor T [Ts] cell) exhibited normal levels in patients with undetectable retroviral load, were increased in parallel to retroviral load, and were associated with low CD8 T lymphocytes and low CD19 B lymphocytes. Normal or even increased levels of DCs and normal or even increased levels of PBL with a Treg or Ts phenotype that coincide with viral load increases and CD8 T- and CD19 B-lymphocyte decreases suggest a functioning immunoregulatory system that reacts to HIV replication. Increased CD8 PBL counts imply immunocompetence. Increased CD8 PBL counts and normal or even upregulated immunoregulatory cells might stabilize our long-term HIV-infected patients with hemophilia clinically."

A bioinformatic approach.,"One of the main characteristics of the human immunodeficiency virus is its genetic variability and rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions. This variability, resulting from the lack of proofreading activity of the viral reverse transcriptase, generates mutations that could be fixed either by random genetic drift or by positive selection. Among the forces driving positive selection are antiretroviral therapy and CD8+ T-cells, the most important immune mechanism involved in viral control. Here, we describe mutations induced by these selective forces acting on the pol gene of HIV in a group of infected individuals. We used Maximum Likelihood analyses of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations per site (dN/dS) to study the extent of positive selection in the protease and the reverse transcriptase, using 614 viral sequences from Colombian patients. We also performed computational approaches, docking and algorithmic analyses, to assess whether the positively selected mutations affected binding to the HLA molecules. We found 19 positively-selected codons in drug resistance-associated sites and 22 located within CD8+ T-cell epitopes. A high percentage of mutations in these epitopes has not been previously reported. According to the docking analyses only one of those mutations affected HLA binding. However, algorithmic methods predicted a decrease in the affinity for the HLA molecule in seven mutated peptides. The bioinformatics strategies described here are useful to identify putative positively selected mutations associated with immune escape but should be complemented with an experimental approach to define the impact of these mutations on the functional profile of the CD8+ T-cells.

Doc No.72,2859,negative/unlabeled,14.413711,"Selection, transmission, and reversion of an antigen-processing cytotoxic T-lymphocyte escape mutation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.","Numerous studies now support that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution is influenced by immune selection pressure, with population studies showing an association between specific HLA alleles and mutations within defined cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes. Here we combine sequence data and functional studies of CD8 T-cell responses to demonstrate that allele-specific immune pressures also select for mutations flanking CD8 epitopes that impair antigen processing. In persons expressing HLA-A3, we demonstrate consistent selection for a mutation in a C-terminal flanking residue of the normally immunodominant Gag KK9 epitope that prevents its processing and presentation, resulting in a rapid decline in the CD8 T-cell response. This single amino acid substitution also lies within a second HLA-A3-restricted epitope, with the mutation directly impairing recognition by CD8 T cells. Transmission of the mutation to subjects expressing HLA-A3 was shown to prevent the induction of normally immunodominant acute-phase responses to both epitopes. However, subsequent in vivo reversion of the mutation was coincident with delayed induction of new CD8 T-cell responses to both epitopes. These data demonstrate that mutations within the flanking region of an HIV-1 epitope can impair recognition by an established CD8 T-cell response and that transmission of these mutations alters the acute-phase CD8(+) T-cell response. Moreover, reversion of these mutations in the absence of the original immune pressure reveals the potential plasticity of immunologically selected evolutionary changes."
Doc No.73,8327,negative/unlabeled,14.385736,Frequent and variable cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte escape-associated fitness costs in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype B Gag proteins.,"Cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations undermine the durability of effective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CD8(+) T cell responses. The rate of CTL escape from a given response is largely governed by the net of all escape-associated viral fitness costs and benefits. The observation that CTL escape mutations can carry an associated fitness cost in terms of reduced virus replication capacity (RC) suggests a fitness cost-benefit trade-off that could delay CTL escape and thereby prolong CD8 response effectiveness. However, our understanding of this potential fitness trade-off is limited by the small number of CTL escape mutations for which a fitness cost has been quantified. Here, we quantified the fitness cost of the 29 most common HIV-1B Gag CTL escape mutations using an in vitro RC assay. The majority (20/29) of mutations reduced RC by more than the benchmark M184V antiretroviral drug resistance mutation, with impacts ranging from 8% to 69%. Notably, the reduction in RC was significantly greater for CTL escape mutations associated with protective HLA class I alleles than for those associated with nonprotective alleles. To speed the future evaluation of CTL escape costs, we also developed an in silico approach for inferring the relative impact of a mutation on RC based on its computed impact on protein thermodynamic stability. These data illustrate that the magnitude of CTL escape-associated fitness costs, and thus the barrier to CTL escape, varies widely even in the conserved Gag proteins and suggest that differential escape costs may contribute to the relative efficacy of CD8 responses."
Doc No.74,5487,negative/unlabeled,14.376644,Medication usage patterns in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection: a comparison of patient-reported medication usage with medical chart review.,"Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) receive numerous medications from multiple providers. As a result, it is important that medication usage is properly documented in each patient's medical record. Lack of adequate documentation may confound a provider's assessment of drug efficacy, potentially leading to an increased incidence of drug interactions and adverse effects. The objective of this study was to determine if discrepancies exist between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record by healthcare providers. Data were obtained using structured telephone surveys and medical chart review. Study participants were recruited from the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center AIDS Clinic. Results obtained for 41 patients demonstrated discrepancies between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record ranging from 9 to 92 percent, depending on the class of drug. The largest differences were observed with the ""as-needed"" class of drugs: benzodiazepines (92 percent), morphine (60 percent), and codeine (56 percent). Differences were also noted for scheduled medications: ketoconazole (54 percent), clotrimazole (45 percent), acyclovir (38 percent), zidovudine (15 percent), and pentamidine (9 percent). These observed discrepancies reaffirm the need for accurate exchange of information between provider and patient to promote the most effective, rational, and safe drug therapy. Careful reviews of medication usage at each visit and use of pharmacy-based medication profiles are potential mechanisms to improve documentation of medication usage in HIV-infected patients."

Two hundred fifty faecal samples from HIV patients were examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts using a conventional coproscopic approach. Such oocysts were detected in 18 (7.2%) out of 250 faecal samples. Genomic DNAs from 250 samples were then subjected to a nested-PCR-RFLP technique targeting different loci of 18S rRNA gene for species identification. Out of 250 samples, 27 (10.8%) were positive for different Cryptosporidium spp; Restriction patterns resulting from the digestion of the nested amplicon with restriction endonucleases VspI and SspI showed that C. parvum (70.38%) was the most prevalent species, followed by C. hominis (25.92%) and C. meleagridis (3.7%), respectively. The mean CD4+ T-cell count was 215 cells/μL. There was a strong association between cryptosporidiosis and CD4+ T-cell count (P = 0.000) with the highest prevalence recorded among patients with CD4+ T-cell count < 200 cells/μL. This confirms that there is a low opportunity for this parasite to get established as the patients CD4+ T-cell count increases. Also HIV infection increased the risk of having Cryptosporidium. Our epidemiological findings are useful for any preventive intervention to control disease diffusion."
Doc No.76,4194,negative/unlabeled,14.285436,Maintenance of viral suppression in HIV-1-infected HLA-B*57+ elite suppressors despite CTL escape mutations.,"Rare human immunodeficiency virus 1-infected individuals, termed elite suppressors (ES), maintain plasma virus levels of <50 copies/ml and normal CD4 counts without therapy. The major histocompatibility complex class I allele group human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*57 is overrepresented in this population. Mutations in HLA-B*57-restricted epitopes have been observed in ES, but their significance has remained unclear. Here we investigate the extent and impact of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations in HLA-B*57+ ES. We provide the first direct evidence that most ES experience chronic low level viremia. Sequencing revealed a striking discordance between the genotypes of plasma virus and archived provirus in resting CD4+ T cells. Mutations in HLA-B*57-restricted Gag epitopes were present in all viruses from plasma but were rare in proviruses, suggesting powerful selective pressure acting at these epitopes. Surprisingly, strong CD8+ T cell interferon-gamma responses were detected against some mutant epitopes found in plasma virus, suggesting the development of de novo responses to viral variants. In some individuals, relative CD8+ T cell interleukin-2 responses showed better correlation with the selection observed in vivo. Thus, analysis of low level viremia reveals an unexpectedly high level of CTL escape mutations reflecting selective pressure acting at HLA-B*57-restricted epitopes in ES. Continued viral suppression probably reflects CTL responses against unmutated epitopes and residual or de novo responses against epitopes with escape mutations."

The ability of pharmacist-provided medication therapy management (MTM) services to increase medication adherence, improve health outcomes, and reduce overall medical costs has been demonstrated in community pharmacies for chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. However, the effectiveness of pharmacist-provided MTM services in HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has not been well studied. In January 2005, a pilot program to evaluate MTM services for patients with HIV/AIDS began in California, allowing 10 HIV/AIDS specialty pharmacies to receive compensation for the MTM services that they provided to HIV/AIDS patients."

Doc No.79,8601,negative/unlabeled,14.254598,Infection by different HIV-1 subtypes (B and C) results in a similar immune activation profile despite distinct immune backgrounds.,"We compared the immune activation profile of 46 HIV-negative and 75 HIV-positive Israelis infected with HIV-1 subtype B, with 85 HIV-negative and 102 HIV-positive Ethiopian immigrants to Israel, who were infected with HIV subtype C. The HIV-negative Ethiopians had exceedingly high blood levels of eosinophils, immunoglobulin E (IgE), and p75s tumor-necrosis factor receptors (p75sTNFR); secretion of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC); proportion of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR+ cells within CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell subsets; and proportion of CD45RO+ CD4+ cells; while having significantly lower secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by PBMC and percentage of CD45RA+ CD4+ and CD28+ CD8+ cells. HIV infection in both populations was associated with reduced IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 secretion, number of CD28+ and CD45RA+ CD8+ cells, and increased number of HLA-DR+-CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells, and CD45RO+ CD8+ cells. Thus, infection with HIV-1 subtypes B and C of studied Israelis and Ethiopians, respectively, results in a similar immune activation profile at all stages of the infection when living in the same environment, despite the striking different immune profile observed in the HIV-negative Israeli and Ethiopian populations. Together with our previous observations, this indicates that HIV subtype is not a major determinant in the natural course of HIV infection."
Doc No.80,2272,positive/labeled,14.229789,Claudin-1 gene variants and susceptibility to hepatitis C infection in HIV-1 infected intravenous drug users (an ANRS case-control study).,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) seroprevalence is highly diverse among human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected patients, ranging between 10% of HIV-1 infected homo-bisexuel men, to >92% in patients infected with HIV-1 who acquired HIV-1 through intravenous drug use. Thus, being HCV-free while having acquired HIV-1 via intravenous drug use is a rare situation. Claudin-1 is a protein involved in intracellular tight-junctions and has been identified as a major cellular co-receptor for HCV infection. Our objective was to determine whether Claudin-1 gene (CLDN1) mutations might be involved in natural resistance to HCV infection. We conducted a case-control study. All recruited patients acquired HIV-1 infection via intravenous drug use route before 1995. The case study patients remained free from HCV infection (negative anti-HCV antibodies and HCV-RNA). The control study patients was co-infected with HCV (positive anti-HCV antibodies). Direct genomic sequencing of the CLDN1 gene coding region and adjacent intron/exons junctions was performed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A total of 138 Caucasian patients were enrolled. Twenty-two patients (cases) were free from HCV infection and 116 (controls) were co-infected with HCV. We found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) described previously with no significant differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls. In conclusion, despite being a major cellular co-receptor for HCV entry in vitro, we did not identify any specific substitution in CLDN1 gene coding region in our study patients highly exposed but resistant to HCV infection in vivo. Other cellular co-factors involved in HCV infection should be investigated in this highly-exposed intravenous drug users patients."
Doc No.81,574,negative/unlabeled,14.222817,Intentionality of medication non-adherence among individuals living with HIV/AIDS in Hong Kong.,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy is essential to treatment success for individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Despite the wealth of studies in examining antiretroviral non-adherence, few have distinguished between intentional and unintentional non-adherence. The present study attempted to identify factors associated with adherence, intentional non-adherence, and unintentional non-adherence among HIV+ individuals using a longitudinal design. Dietary instructions and medication schedule were also included to measure the subtleties of antiretroviral adherence. One hundred and two HIV+ patients who were under antiretroviral therapy were recruited in an outpatient clinic in Hong Kong at baseline with six months follow-up. Using the conventional adherence rate, only 12 (11.8%) of participants reported having missed/ altered medication in the past four days. However, using a more comprehensive assessment, only 27 (26.5%) participants were classified as adherers. Results showed that, adherers were significantly older and had higher adherence self-efficacy than those who were unintentional or intentional non-adherers. Participants classified as unintentional non-adherers had longer length of diagnosis and started medication longer than adherers and intentional non-adherers. Participants classified as intentional non-adherers had worse mental health, higher level of self-stigma, and reported higher score in avoidant coping than adherers and unintentional non-adherers. They also scored higher in physical symptoms than adherers. Findings highlight the importance of a reliable, comprehensive measurement for adherence and extend on previous adherence literature that intentional and unintentional non-adherence are separate entities and are associated with different factors. Future research should understand the intentions behind non-adherence and this would serve as an important guide in the development of interventions aimed at improving antiretroviral adherence for HIV+ patients."

Socio-demographics, substance use and clinical correlates of antiretroviral therapy non-adherence were studied in 100 HIV-1 infected drug users receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months in Hanoi, Vietnam. All study participants were men with a mean age of 29.9 ± 4.9 years. The median duration on antiretroviral therapy was 16.2 ± 12.7 months; 83% reported 'very good' or 'perfect' adherence in the past 30 days on a subjective one-item Likert scale at time of study enrollment; 48% of participants reported drug use within the previous 6 months, with 22% reporting current drug use. Injection drug use with or without non-injection drug use in the past 6 months (95% C.I. 2.19, 1.30-3.69) and years on antiretroviral therapy (95% C.I. 1.43, 1.14-1.78) were correlated with suboptimal adherence. These findings support Vietnam's ongoing scale-up of harm reduction programmes for injection drug users and their integration with antiretroviral therapy delivery. Moreover, results highlight the need to identify and implement new ways to support high levels of antiretroviral therapy adherence as duration on antiretroviral therapy increases. "
Doc No.83,5177,negative/unlabeled,14.076834,Novel function of prothymosin alpha as a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gene expression in primary macrophages.,"CD8(+) T lymphocytes control human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection by a cytotoxic major histocompatibility complex-restricted pathway as well as by secretion of noncytotoxic soluble inhibitory factors. Several components of CD8(+) cell supernatants have been identified that contribute to the latter activity. In this study we report that prothymosin alpha (ProTalpha), a protein found in the cell culture medium of the herpesvirus saimiri-transformed CD8(+) T-cell line, K#1 50K, has potent HIV-1-inhibitory activity. Depletion of native ProTalpha from an HIV-1-inhibitory fraction of CD8(+) cell supernatants removes the inhibitory activity, supporting its role in inhibition via soluble mediators. ProTalpha is an abundant, acidic peptide that has been reported to be localized in the nucleus and associated with cell proliferation and activation of transcription. In this report we demonstrate that ProTalpha suppresses HIV-1 replication, its activity is target cell specific, and inhibition occurs following viral integration. Native and recombinant ProTalpha protein potently inhibit HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven gene expression in macrophages. Furthermore studies using different promoters in lentiviral vectors (cytomegalovirus and phosphoglycerate kinase) revealed that suppression of viral replication by ProTalpha is not HIV LTR specific."

Although directly observed therapy (DOT) has been suggested as an intervention to improve adherence, there is a paucity of data describing the attitudes and beliefs regarding DOT for ART among HIV-infected individuals. This study was designed to evaluate the acceptability and psychometric properties of a survey instrument for use in assessing barriers and facilitators of adherence to ART DOT in prison. From July 1, 1999 to April 1, 2000, we piloted an interviewer-administered questionnaire to assess health beliefs and attitudes regarding HIV treatment among 65 HIV-infected prison inmates receiving one or more of their antiretrovirals via directly observed therapy (DOT). The first 24 participants were administered the questionnaire to determine the feasibility of surveying prisoners in a correctional setting. There were no adherence data collected on these participants. The remaining 41 participants had their adherence measured in addition to receiving the questionnaire. Thirty-one were included in the final analysis because 10 did not complete the study. Multiple antiretroviral adherence measures (electronic device medication monitoring [eDEM] caps, medication administration records [MARs], and pill counts) were assessed among a subset of the participants (n = 31) and correlated to the instrument response items. The median internal consistency reliability coefficient for the multi-item scales was 0.79. The strongest correlation between inmates' beliefs and their adherence was between ""positive beliefs about protease inhibitors"" and the MAR adherence measure (r = 0.72; p < 0.001). This study provides preliminary support for the psychometric properties of the survey in this correctional setting."
Doc No.85,3465,negative/unlabeled,14.039968,Escape and compensation from early HLA-B57-mediated cytotoxic T-lymphocyte pressure on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag alter capsid interactions with cyclophilin A.,"Certain histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are associated with improved clinical outcomes for individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but the mechanisms for their effects remain undefined. An early CD8(+) T-cell escape mutation in the dominant HLA-B57-restricted Gag epitope TW10 (TSTLQEQIGW) has been shown to impair HIV-1 replication capacity in vitro. We demonstrate here that this T(242)N substitution in the capsid protein is associated with upstream mutations at residues H(219), I(223), and M(228) in the cyclophilin A (CypA)-binding loop in B57(+) individuals with progressive disease. In an independent cohort of epidemiologically linked transmission pairs, the presence of these substitutions in viruses encoding T(242)N was associated with significantly higher plasma viremia in donors, further suggesting that these secondary mutations compensated for the replication defect of T(242)N. Using NL4-3 constructs, we illustrate the ability of these CypA loop changes to partially restore replication of the T(242)N variant in vitro. Notably, these mutations also enhanced viral resistance to the drug cyclosporine A, indicating a reduced dependence of the compensated virus on CypA that is normally essential for optimal infectivity. Therefore, mutations in TW10 allow HIV-1 to evade a dominant early CD8(+) T-cell response, but the benefits of escape are offset by a defect in capsid function. These data suggest that TW10 escape variants undergo a postentry block that is partially overcome by changes in the CypA-binding loop and identify a mechanism for an HIV-1 fitness defect that may contribute to the slower disease progression associated with HLA-B57."

Impaired HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses may underlie the persistently high viral loads observed in infants. We examined the frequency and phenotype of infant HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells in 7 HIV-infected antiretroviral therapy-naïve infants during the first 2 years of life, using class I HLA tetramers and IFN-γ-ELISPOT. The frequency (0.088-3.9% of CD3(+)CD8(+) cells) and phenotype (CD27(+)CD28(-), CD45RA(+/-), CD57(+/-), HLA-DR(+), CD95(+)) of infant HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells were similar to reports in adults undergoing early infection. Unlike adults, at 23-24 months post-infection a high frequency of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells expressed HLA-DR (mean 80%, range 68-85%) and CD95 (mean 88%, range 79-96%), suggesting sustained activation and vulnerability to apoptosis. Despite comparable expansion of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells of a similar phenotype to adults during early infection, infant T cells failed to contain HIV-1 replication, and remained persistently activated and vulnerable to apoptosis during chronic infection."
Doc No.89,6616,negative/unlabeled,13.947503,Intracellular glutathione levels in T cell subsets decrease in HIV-infected individuals.,"The authors have shown previously that intracellular glutathione (GSH) plays an important role in the regulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transcription and replication in vitro, through modulation of signal transduction by inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, intracellular GSH levels are known to regulate T-lymphocyte function. In multiparameter FACS studies presented here, we show that relative GSH levels in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from HIV+ individuals are significantly lower than in corresponding subsets from uninfected controls. These studies define the relative intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes from 134 HIV-infected individuals and 31 uninfected controls. The greatest decreases in intracellular GSH occur in subsets of T cells in individuals in the later stages of the HIV infection. In AIDS patients, GSH levels are 63% of normal in CD4+ T cells (p less than 0.0001) and are 62% of normal in CD8+ T cells (p less than 0.0001). Similarly, in AIDS-related complex (ARC) patients, GSH levels are 66% of normal in CD4+ T cells (p less than 0.003) and are 69% of normal in CD8+ T cells (p less than 0.003). These findings suggest that low intracellular GSH levels may be an important factor in HIV infection and in the resulting immunodeficiency."

This study piloted a structural intervention, Directly Administered Antiretroviral Therapy (DAART), to assist methadone-maintenance patients in HIV medication adherence. Twenty-four participants received: (1) antiretroviral medications at the methadone clinic daily before receiving their methadone; (2) take-home antiretroviral medication for days they were not scheduled to attend the methadone clinic, and (3) brief adherence counseling to address adherence barriers. DAART lasted 24 weeks, with a planned step-down to twice-weekly administration in weeks 25-36, followed by self-administration in weeks 37-48. Retention rates at weeks 24, 36, and 48 were 83, 92, and 75% respectively. DAART was associated with improvement in the proportion of participants achieving viral suppression as well as with high medication adherence rates (clinic-verified; 85% and self-reported 97%) during the active intervention phase. DAART was effective as an intervention but did not promote transition to self-administration. This study demonstrates that DAART is adaptable and simple enough to be implemented into methadone treatment programs interested in providing HIV adherence services."

For the treating practitioner, tailoring the pharmaceutical regimen according to patient features and clinical circumstances can be a challenge. First-line therapeutic regimens for the management of HBV infection include monotherapy with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agent that has potent on-treatment viral response and low rates of resistance; in the future, these regimens may include a combination of more than one nucleos(t)ide analogue or a combination of a nucleos(t)ide analogue and pegylated interferon. The oral nucleos(t)ide analogues are generally better tolerated than interferon; however, they can be expensive when administered for lengthy periods and can also lead to medication resistance. Lamivudine, the first approved nucleoside analogue for the treatment of HBV infection, has a very high resistance profile; in fact, lamivudine exposure increases viral resistance to other commercially available nucleos(t)ide analogues: entecavir, telbivudine, and adefovir. For these reasons, the 2007 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines no longer recommend lamivudine as first-line therapy for the management of HBV infection. A satellite symposium conducted during the 57th Annual Meeting of the AASLD in Boston, Massachusetts, presented approaches to customizing the management of chronic HBV infection. The presentation highlighted recent findings suggesting that early, profound, and sustained viral suppression improves the probability of sustained virologic response and reduces the likelihood of nucleos(t)ide resistance."

Medicaid pharmacy claims data were used for analyses. To examine the association between treatment group and medication adherence, three types of multivariate regressions were employed. In addition, all regressions were conducted for the whole population using data from 1995 to 2001 as well as a subpopulation, which excluded data prior to September 1997. Model covariates included patient characteristics, healthcare utilization, and non-study antiretroviral therapy use. The likelihood of > or =95% adherence among patients on combination therapy was three times greater than patients taking 3TC and ZDV in separate pills. Also, combination therapy patients had on average 1.4 fewer adherence failures per year of follow-up and nearly double the time to adherence failure compared to the separate pills group. Consistency among study results suggests that fixed dose combination therapies such as lamivudine (3TC) 150 mg/ zidovudine (ZDV) 300 mg should be considered when prescribing HIV treatment that includes an appropriate dual nucleoside."
Doc No.93,1647,negative/unlabeled,13.853774,Characterizing immune reconstitution after long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy in pediatric AIDS.,"In this study, we sought to characterize the T lymphocyte recovery in vertically HIV-1-infected children who respond to long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A 3-year longitudinal retrospective study was used to perform a cross-sectional study of 32 children rated according to the time course of CD4(+) T cell percentages in response to antiretroviral therapy and CDC clinical classification: (1) long-term asymptomatic (LTA group): 8 children in A1 during the whole follow-up period; (2) responsive to HAART (Rec group): 13 children in C3 before HAART who achieved CD4(+) T cell counts of > 500 cells/mm(3) after 3 years of HAART; and (3) nonresponsive to HAART (Non-Rec group): 11 children in C3 during the whole follow-up period despite 3 years of HAART. We also studied 17 healthy age-matched uninfected children as controls. Lymphoproliferative responses (LPRs) were evaluated by incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine, identification of T cell subsets by three-color flow cytometry, and determination of thymic production of T cells by quantification of T cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECs). Interestingly, the Rec group showed an increase in percentage of CD4(+) T cells and a decrease in viral load, and recovered LPRs to mitogens and recall antigens, with values similar to those of the LTA group. Moreover, the Rec group produced similar percentages and absolute counts of naive (CD45RA(+)CD62L(+)) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and TRECs similar to those of the LTA group. In particular, the Rec group produced similar percentages of CD8(+)CD28(-)CD57(+) and CD8(+)CD28(-)CD57(-) T cell subsets compared with controls. Our data indicate that among children who have already progressed to AIDS and severe immunodeficiency but who respond to HAART, the immune system can recover and resemble those of nonprogressors or even uninfected children, in quantitative as well as in functional terms."
Doc No.94,6736,positive/labeled,13.780761,Adaptation of CD8 T cell responses to changing HIV-1 sequences in a cohort of HIV-1 infected individuals not selected for a certain HLA allele.,"HIV evades CD8 T cell mediated pressure by viral escape mutations in targeted CD8 T cell epitopes. A viral escape mutation can lead to a decline of the respective CD8 T cell response. Our question was what happened after the decline of a CD8 T cell response and - in the case of viral escape - if a new CD8 T cell response towards the mutated antigen could be generated in a population not selected for certain HLA alleles. We studied 19 antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1 infected individuals with different disease courses longitudinally. A median number of 12 (range 2-24) CD8 T cell responses towards Gag and Nef were detected per study subject. A total of 30 declining CD8 T cell responses were studied in detail and viral sequence analyses showed amino acid changes in 25 (83%) of these. Peptide titration assays and definition of optimal CD8 T cell epitopes revealed 12 viral escape mutations with one de-novo response (8%). The de-novo response, however, showed less effector functions than the original CD8 T cell response. In addition we identified 4 shifts in immunodominance. For one further shift in immunodominance, the mutations occurred outside the optimal epitope and might represent processing changes. Interestingly, four adaptations to the virus (the de-novo response and 3 shifts in immunodominance) occurred in the group of chronically infected progressors. None of the subjects with adaptation to the changing virus carried the HLA alleles B57, B*58:01 or B27. Our results show that CD8 T cell responses adapt to the mutations of HIV. However it was limited to only 20% (5 out of 25) of the epitopes with viral sequence changes in a cohort not expressing protective HLA alleles. "
Doc No.95,1605,negative/unlabeled,13.772074,Caregiver-reported antiretroviral therapy non-adherence during the first week and after a month of treatment initiation among children diagnosed with HIV in Ethiopia.,"To achieve optimal virologic suppression for children undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART), adherence must be excellent. This is defined as taking more than 95% of their prescribed doses. To our knowledge, no study in Ethiopia has evaluated the level of treatment adherence at the beginning of the child's treatment. Our aim was therefore to evaluate caregiver-reported ART non-adherence among children and any predictors for this during the early course of treatment. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 306 children with HIV in eight health facilities in Ethiopia who were registered at ART clinics between 20 December 2014 and 20 April 2015. The adherence rate reported by caregivers during the first week and after a month of treatment initiation was 92.8% and 93.8%, respectively. Our findings highlight important predictors of non-adherence. Children whose caregivers were not undergoing HIV treatment and care themselves were less likely to be non-adherent during the first week of treatment (aOR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.71) and the children whose caregivers did not use a medication reminder after one month of treatment initiation (aOR = 5.21, 95% CI: 2.23, 12.16) were more likely to miss the prescribed dose. Moreover, after one month of the treatment initiation, those receiving protease inhibitor (LPV/r) or ABC-based treatment regimens were more likely to be non-adherent (aOR = 12.32, 95% CI: 3.25, 46.67). To promote treatment adherence during ART initiation in children, particular emphasis needs to be placed on a baseline treatment regimen and ways to issue reminders about the child's medication to both the health care system and caregivers. Further, large scale studies using a combination of adherence measuring methods upon treatment initiation are needed to better define the magnitude and predictors of ART non-adherence in resource-limited settings."
Doc No.96,2067,negative/unlabeled,13.764603,Influence of HIV infection on changes in circulating leukocyte counts during measles in Zambian children.,"Measles remains an important problem in Africa, where human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is prevalent. To identify the consequences of coinfection, Zambian children hospitalized with measles were studied at entry, discharge, and 1 month after discharge. All children had low lymphocyte and eosinophil counts at entry and high leukocyte and monocyte counts during recovery. The death of cultured lymphocytes was more prolonged for HIV-positive children. CD38 and Fas were increased on CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, and CD28 was decreased on CD8+ lymphocytes in all children. Abnormalities in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte percentages and CD28 expression associated with HIV infection were preserved during measles. Therefore, the patterns of changes in leukocyte counts were similar, with little evidence that measles exacerbated HIV-associated lymphocyte abnormalities."
Doc No.97,944,negative/unlabeled,13.743474,Comprehensive evaluation of caregiver-reported antiretroviral therapy adherence for HIV-infected children.,"For HIV-infected children, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is often assessed by caregiver report but there are few data on their validity. We conducted prospective evaluations with 191 children ages 0-14 years and their caregivers over 6 months in western Kenya to identify questionnaire items that best predicted adherence to ART. Medication Event Monitoring Systems(®) (MEMS, MWV/AARDEX Ltd., Switzerland) electronic dose monitors were used as external criterion for adherence. We employed a novel variable selection tool using the LASSO technique with logistic regression to identify items best correlated with dichotomized MEMS adherence (≥90 or <90 % doses taken). Nine of 48 adherence items were identified as the best predictors of adherence, including missed or late doses in the past 7 days, problems giving the child medicines, and caregiver-level factors like not being present at medication taking. These items could be included in adherence assessment tools for pediatric patients. "
Doc No.98,197,positive/labeled,13.733626,Active cocaine use is associated with lack of HIV-1 virologic suppression independent of nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy: use of a rapid screening tool during routine clinic visits.,"Clarifying the relationship between illicit drug use and HIV-1 virologic suppression requires characterization of both illicit drug use activity and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We developed a rapid clinical questionnaire to assess prior 7-day illicit drug use and ART adherence in a cross-sectional study among 1777 HIV-infected persons in care. Of these, 76% were male, 35% were African-American, and 8% reported injection drug use as their probable route of HIV-1 infection. Questionnaire-reported frequencies of cocaine and marijuana use within the previous 7 days were 3.3% and 12.1%, respectively. Over three quarters (77.8%) of participants were on ART, of whom 69.7% had HIV-1 virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA<48 copies/mL). Univariate analyses revealed that compared to no use, cocaine and marijuana use were both associated with missed ART doses (P<0.01). Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for nonadherence demonstrated that cocaine use was independently associated with failing to achieve virologic suppression (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.46; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.22-0.98) but marijuana use was not (aOR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.72-1.62). This result strengthens the evidence of a direct effect of cocaine on virologic control, independent of nonadherence to ART."
Doc No.99,1894,positive/labeled,13.720297,Barriers to and facilitators of HIV-positive patients' adherence to antiretroviral treatment regimens.,"HIV-positive patients must strictly adhere to antiretroviral regimens for the medications to work properly. Little, however, is known about the obstacles that patients face in adhering to the regimens or what, if anything, helps patients to adhere. The goals of the project were to describe, from HIV-positive patients' own perspectives, the barriers they face in adhering to antiretroviral regimens and the strategies they use to maximize their adherence. Five main barriers (forgetfulness, social/physical environment, complexity of the regimens, medication side effects, and inadequate patient knowledge) to adherence and six main facilitators (mechanical devices, ""making a commitment,"" ""routinizing,"" health beliefs, social support, and professional support) emerged from the data. Patients may overcome some of these barriers by receiving better health education about the need for adherence, professional and lay support for their efforts, and mechanical devices such as alarm clocks and medi-sets. Other barriers, however, such as the complexity of the medications, highlight the need for simplified antiretroviral regimens."
Doc No.100,6016,negative/unlabeled,13.714173,Human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat responds to T-cell activation signals.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of AIDS, infects and kills lymphoid cells bearing the CD4 antigen. In an infected cell, a number of cellular as well as HIV-encoded gene products determine the levels of viral gene expression and HIV replication. Efficient HIV-replication occurs in activated T cells. Utilizing transient expression assays, we show that gene expression directed by the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) increases in response to T-cell activation signals. The effects of T-cell activation and of the HIV-encoded trans-activator (TAT) are multiplicative. Analysis of mutations and deletions in the HIV LTR reveals that the region responding to T-cell activation signals is located at positions -105 to -80. These sequences are composed of two direct repeats, which are homologous to the core transcriptional enhancer elements in the simian virus 40 genome. Our studies reveal that these elements function as the HIV enhancer. By acting directly on the HIV LTR, T-cell activation may play an important role in HIV gene expression and in the activation of latent HIV."
Doc No.101,6160,positive/labeled,13.709046,"Positive association between beta-chemokine-producing T cells and HIV type 1 viral load in HIV-infected subjects in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.","The role of beta-chemokines in controlling HIV replication in vivo is still controversial. Therefore, the association between HIV-1 plasma viral load and the capacity of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells to produce beta-chemokines was studied in 28 antiretroviral drug-naïve HIV-1-infected female sex workers in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Percentages of beta-chemokine-positive T cells were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by flow cytometry after intracellular staining for RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, and MIP-1beta. HIV-1-infected subjects had higher percentages of MIP-1alpha- and MIP-1beta-positive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (p < 0.02) and of RANTES-positive CD8(+) T cells (p = 0.054) than uninfected controls. Percentages of RANTES- and MIP-1beta-positive CD8(+) T cells correlated directly with HIV-1 plasma viral load (p < 0.02). Percentages of beta-chemokine-positive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells correlated directly with percentages of HLA-DR-positive T cells (p < 0.02) and inversely (except RANTES in CD4(+) T cells) with absolute numbers of CD4(+) T cells (p < 0.05) in peripheral blood. These data indicate that increased percentages of beta-chemokine-producing T cells in HIV-1-infected subjects correlate with disease progression and are a sign of viremia-driven chronic T cell activation."
Doc No.102,895,negative/unlabeled,13.681089,Immunologic response to combination nucleoside analogue plus protease inhibitor therapy in stable antiretroviral therapy-experienced human immunodeficiency virus-infected children.,"The response of 40 immunologic parameters was studied for 147 clinically stable, protease inhibitor-naive, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children aged 2-17 years when antiretroviral therapy was changed to either a dual nucleoside analogue regimen or a protease inhibitor-containing regimen. Immunologic response to therapy, as measured by lymphocyte subsets, 3-color flow cytometric measures, and lymphoproliferative assays, were investigated for changes in weeks 44 and 48. The most significant changes after baseline that were associated with the administration of a protease inhibitor-containing regimen were seen for percentages of CD8(+)/CD38(+)/HLA-DR(+), CD8(+)/CD95(+)/CD28(-), and CD8. The percentages of CD8(+)/CD38(+)/HLA-DR(+) and CD8(+)/CD95(+)/CD28(-) decreased from baseline medians of 33% and 46% to medians of 18% and 30% at week 44 (P<.0001 for both). Median CD4 cell count increased 168 cells/microL (from 694 cells/microL to 862 cells/microL; P=.02) by week 48 in this clinically stable population. Changes in lymphoproliferative responses to HIV antigens and recall antigens did not increase over time and between groups."
Doc No.103,7742,negative/unlabeled,13.665159,HIV-1 infection abrogates CD8+ T cell mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling responses.,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are dynamic and sensitive regulators of T cell function and differentiation. Altered MAPK signaling has been associated with the inflammatory and autoimmune diseases lupus and arthritis and with some pathogenic viral infections. HIV-1 infection is characterized by chronic immune inflammation, aberrantly heightened CD8(+) T cell activation levels, and altered T cell function. The relationship between MAPK pathway function, HIV-1-induced activation (CD38 and HLA-DR), and exhaustion (Tim-3) markers in circulating CD8(+) T cells remains unknown. Phosphorylation of the MAPK effector proteins ERK and p38 was examined by ""phosflow"" flow cytometry in 79 recently HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral-treatment-naïve adults and 21 risk-matched HIV-1-negative controls. We identified a subset of CD8(+) T cells refractory to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (referred to as p-ERK1/2-refractory cells) that was greatly expanded in HIV-1-infected adults. The CD8(+) p-ERK1/2-refractory cells were highly activated (CD38(+) HLA-DR(+)) but not exhausted (Tim-3 negative), tended to have low CD8 expression, and were enriched in intermediate and late transitional memory states of differentiation (CD45RA(-) CD28(-) CD27(+/-)). Targeting MAPK pathways to restore ERK1/2 signaling may normalize immune inflammation levels and restore CD8(+) T cell function during HIV-1 infection."
Doc No.104,471,positive/labeled,13.653923,Comparing total health care costs and treatment patterns of HIV patients in a managed care setting.,"The objective of this study was to investigate total health care costs and time to occurrence of hospitalization in HIV-infected patients treated according to the 1998 DHHS guidelines in a managed care setting. The study also investigated which patients do not receive guideline treatment. We used a retrospective cross-sectional study design using medical and pharmacy claims data. Data from 1,791 HIV-infected patients using antiretroviral agents between 1 February 1998 and 31 July 1999, including demographic characteristics, medication guideline use, medication adherence and cost of care, were examined. Factors associated with total health care costs and time-to-inpatient admission (as a proxy for patient outcomes) were assessed. Patients receiving guideline (HAART) therapy (55%) had higher prescription and total health care costs but lower medical costs. Patients not receiving treatment according to guidelines were more likely to be female, older, have comorbidities, lower medication adherence and no AIDS-defining illness. Treatment with HAART guidelines was associated with longer time-to-inpatient admission controlling for other factors. In a short-term cross-sectional analysis, patients treated with HAART guidelines had better outcomes based on time-to-inpatient admission but higher prescription and total health care costs. Some patients are at risk for not receiving care according to national treatment guidelines and may be targeted for intervention programmes."

There is, as yet, little agreement on the definition, etiology, and prevalence of the syndrome. Many studies have examined medication or disease-related factors. Fewer studies have examined patient-related factors. Illicit drug use is an important risk factor for HIV infection, yet the role of drug use in fat distribution has not been well described. We examined fat distribution, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, in relation to drug use, smoking, and alcohol use in Hispanic patients with HIV infection and control group of HIV-negative drug users. Our results suggest that neither drug use nor alcohol consumption are predictors of fat distribution. However, among men, smoking was independently associated with less total fat, less trunk fat, and more appendicular fat. The role of patient-specific factors in the etiology of HIV-associated fat-redistribution syndrome warrants further investigation."
Doc No.106,5591,negative/unlabeled,13.609191,"CD8+ T cells specific for EBV, cytomegalovirus, and influenza virus are activated during primary HIV infection.","Primary viral infections, including primary HIV infection, trigger intense activation of the immune system, with marked expansion of CD38(+)CD8(+) T cells. Whether this expansion involves only viral-specific cells or includes a degree of bystander activation remains a matter of debate. We therefore examined the activation status of EBV-, CMV-, and influenza virus (FLU)-specific CD8(+) T cells during primary HIV infection, in comparison to HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells. The activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR were strongly expressed on HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells. Surprisingly, CD38 expression was also up-regulated on CD8(+) T cells specific for other viruses, albeit to a lesser extent. Activation marker expression returned to normal or near-normal values after 1 year of highly active antiretroviral therapy. HIV viral load correlated with CD38 expression on HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells but also on EBV-, CMV-, and FLU-specific CD8(+) T cells. In primary HIV infection, EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells also showed increased Ki67 expression and decreased Bcl-2 expression, compared with values observed in HIV-seronegative control subjects. These results show that bystander activation occurs during primary HIV infection, even though HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells express the highest level of activation. The role of this bystander activation in lymphocyte homeostasis and HIV pathogenesis remains to be determined."
Doc No.107,4493,negative/unlabeled,13.595892,Cumulative exposure to stimulants and immune function outcomes among HIV-positive and HIV-negative men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study.,"We examined associations between stimulant use (methamphetamine and cocaine) and other substances (nicotine, marijuana, alcohol and inhaled nitrites) with immune function biomarkers among HIV-seropositive (HIV +) men taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV-seronegative (HIV-) men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Among HIV + men, cumulative adherence to ART (4.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.52, 4.71, per 10 years of adherent ART use), and recent cohort enrolment (1.38; 95% CI: 1.24, 1.55) were multiplicatively associated with increase in CD4+/CD8+ ratios. Cumulative use of methamphetamine (0.93; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.98, per 10 use-years), cocaine (0.93; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.96, per 10 use-years) and cumulative medical visits (0.99; 95% CI: 0.98, 0.99, per 10 visit-years), each showed small negative associations with CD4+/CD8+ ratios. Among HIV- men, cumulative medical visits (0.996; 95% CI: 0.993, 0.999), cumulative number of male sexual partners (0.999; 95% CI: 0.998, 0.9998, per 10 partner-years) and cigarette pack-years (1.10; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.18, per 10 pack-years) were associated with CD4+/CD8+ ratios over the same period. ART adherence is associated with a positive immune function independent of stimulant use, underscoring the influence of ART on immune health for HIV+ men who engage in stimulant use."
Doc No.108,704,negative/unlabeled,13.565395,T cell receptor usage of virus-specific CD8 cells and recognition of viral mutations during acute and persistent hepatitis B virus infection.,"T cells specific for a single viral epitope, but using different T cell receptors, should have flexibility in their epitope recognition to protect the infected host against the emergence of viral escape mutants. Therefore, polyclonality of the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response has been hypothesized to be a major determinant in the control of infection. We analyzed the Vbeta chain composition of the core 18-27-specific CD8 cells in acute and persistently HBV-infected patients using HLA-A2 tetrameric complexes and a panel of Vbeta antibodies. Different T cell receptors were utilized by core 18-27-specific CD8 cells both in patients with acute and chronic infection. The functional ability of these epitope-specific T cells to respond to potential viral mutations was then tested. The polyclonal HBV-specific CD8 response present in patients with acute hepatitis displayed a limited efficiency to recognize mutations introduced within the epitope. The ability of core 18-27-specific CD8 to tolerate epitope mutations was found only during persistent HBV infection. The data suggest that although a clonally heterogeneous CD8 response can be largely inhibited by the occurrence of single epitope mutations in primary HBV infection, preferential selection of T cells able to counteract the emergence of viral mutations can occur during persistent infection."
Doc No.109,1718,positive/labeled,13.558797,Timing is everything: antiretroviral nonadherence is associated with impairment in time-based prospective memory.,"Nonadherence to combination antiretroviral (ARV) therapies (cART) is highly prevalent and significantly increases the risk of adverse human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease outcomes. The current study evaluated the hypothesis that prospective memory-a dissociable aspect of episodic memory describing the ability to execute a future intention-plays an important role in successful cART adherence. Seventy-nine individuals with HIV infection who were prescribed at least one ARV medication underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuromedical evaluation prior to completing a 1-month observation of their cART adherence as measured by electronic medication monitoring. Nonadherent individuals (n = 31) demonstrated significantly poorer prospective memory functioning as compared to adherent persons (n = 48), particularly on an index of time-based ProM (i.e., elevated loss of time errors). Deficits in time-based prospective memory were independently predictive of cART nonadherence, even after considering the possible influence of established predictors of adherence, such as general cognitive impairment (e.g., retrospective learning and memory) and psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression). These findings extend a nascent literature showing that impairment in time-based prospective memory significantly increases the risk of medication nonadherence and therefore may guide the development of novel strategies for intervention.

Doc No.110,5997,positive/labeled,13.543918,Lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses to Cryptosporidium parvum in patients coinfected with C. parvum and human immunodeficiency virus.,"We compared the lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses to Cryptosporidium parvum in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and -seronegative patients. The lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses (interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, gamma interferon, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) were assessed for 11 HIV-seropositive, Cryptosporidium-positive (group I) patients; 20 HIV-seropositive, Cryptosporidium-negative (group II) patients; 10 HIV-seronegative, Cryptosporidium-positive (group III) patients, including four post-renal transplant (group IIIa) and 6 presumably immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients; and 20 HIV-seronegative, Cryptosporidium-negative healthy individuals (group IV). No significant difference was observed in the number of patients showing positive lymphoproliferative responses in group I compared to group III (post-renal transplant [group IIIa] or immunocompetent [group IIIb]) patients, while a comparison of the median stimulation indices shows that responses were significantly lower in Cryptosporidium-infected, immunosuppressed (group I and IIIa) patients than in immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients. The number of patients showing positive responses and median stimulation indices was significantly higher for Cryptosporidium-infected (HIV-seropositive and -seronegative) individuals than for uninfected individuals, suggesting that Cryptosporidium induces significant in vitro lymphoproliferative responses in infected individuals. Cytokine levels, except for that of IL-5, were significantly higher in Cryptosporidium-infected (groups I and III) individuals than in uninfected (groups II and IV) individuals. There was no significant difference between the group I and III patients and between Cryptosporidium-infected immunosuppressed (group I or IIIa) and immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients."

All patients harbored HIV-1 LTR quasispecies corresponding to the B subtype. Three patients with high CD4+ T cell counts (>500/mm3) presented LTR sequences with point mutations in the TAR bulge. The LTR sequence from a patient classified as a long-term nonprogressor (LTNP) presented the most frequent naturally occurring length polymorphism (MFNLP) and two substitutions in the TAR region that were predicted to result in two alternative secondary RNA structures. A novel 18-bp deletion, which eliminates part of the putative binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT-1), was identified in the overlapping nef/LTR sequence derived from a patient progressing to AIDS. This deletion coincides with the ability of this virus to consistently replicate at low levels in vivo (viral load <500 RNA copies/ml) and in vitro (unsuccessful virus isolation). On one occasion, when virus isolation was successful, the 18-bp deletion was no longer evident and LTR sequences with intact NFAT-1-binding sites were observed. Inoculation of hu-PBL-SCID mice with viruses from several Mexican patients resulted in differential CD4+ T cell depletion patterns 15 days postinfection, which agree with the in vivo CD4+ T cell count data from each patient."
Doc No.112,5562,negative/unlabeled,13.501054,Human T cell transcription factor GATA-3 stimulates HIV-1 expression.,"A family of transcriptional activating proteins, the GATA factors, has been shown to bind to a consensus motif through a highly conserved C4 zinc finger DNA binding domain. One member of this multigene family, GATA-3, is most abundantly expressed in T lymphocytes, a cellular target for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and replication. In vitro DNase I footprinting analysis revealed six hGATA-3 binding sites in the U3 region (the transcriptional regulatory domain) of the HIV-1 LTR. Cotransfection of an hGATA-3 expression plasmid with a reporter plasmid whose transcription is directed by the HIV-1 LTR resulted in 6- to 10-fold stimulation of LTR-mediated transcription, whereas site specific mutation of these GATA sites resulted in virtual abrogation of the activation by hGATA-3. Further, deletion of the hGATA-3 transcriptional activation domain abolished GATA-dependent HIV-1 trans-activation, showing that the stimulation of viral transcription observed is a direct effect of cotransfected hGATA-3. Introduction of the HIV-1 plasmids in which the GATA sites have been mutated into human T lymphocytes also caused a significant reduction in LTR-mediated transcription at both the basal level and in (PHA- plus PMA-) stimulated T cells. These observations suggest that in addition to its normal role in T lymphocyte gene regulation, hGATA-3 may also play a significant role in HIV-1 transcriptional activation."
Doc No.113,2911,negative/unlabeled,13.486025,Liver injury during highly active antiretroviral therapy: the effect of hepatitis C coinfection.,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the elevation of liver enzyme and/or bilirubin levels caused by the use of a medication or drug. In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, some of these events may not be directly caused by medication. Acute viral hepatitis, reactivation of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and/or alcohol use may play roles. Elevated transaminase levels are a signal of liver injury, but most cases improve despite continuation of drug therapy. Approximately 33% of patients with HIV infection are coinfected with HCV. Patients with HIV or HCV infection are more prone to DILI, possibly because of impaired hepatocyte defense mechanisms. HCV coinfection is associated with a 2-10-fold chance of developing elevated transaminase levels during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Patients with HIV/HCV coinfection should not be denied HAART. Instead, they should be followed-up with monthly liver function tests and referred to specialists if grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme elevations occur."
Doc No.114,741,negative/unlabeled,13.433813,Antiretroviral therapy adherence among transgender women living with HIV.,"Despite disproportionate rates of HIV among transgender women and evidence that medication adherence is necessary for treatment success and increased likelihood of survival, there has been little investigation into antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence issues among transgender women. This study examined rates of self-reported ART adherence among transgender women on ART (n = 35) and well-established correlates of nonadherence, including depression, adherence self-efficacy, patient perceptions of interactions with their providers, and perceived adverse side effects of ART compared to other respondents (n = 2,770). Transgender women on ART were less likely to report 90% adherence rates or higher and reported less confidence in their abilities to integrate treatment regimens into their daily lives. When transgender women were compared to other respondents, regardless of the current medication regimen, they reported significantly fewer positive interactions with their health care providers. Training for providers and integration of hormone therapy into HIV care is recommended."

However, current estimates of the HTLV-1 rate rely on the anthropological calibration of phylogenies using assumed dates of human migration events. To obtain an independent rate estimate, we analyzed two variable regions of the HTLV-1 genome (LTR and env) from eight infected families. Remarkable genetic stability was observed, as only two mutations in LTR (756 bp) and three mutations in env (522 bp) occurred within the 16 vertical transmission chains, including one ambiguous position in each region. The evolutionary rate in HTLV-1 was then calculated using a maximum-likelihood approach that used the highest and lowest possible times of HTLV-1 shared ancestry, given the known transmission histories. The rates for the LTR and env regions were 9.58 x 10(-8)-1.25 x 10(-5) and 7.84 x 10(-7) -2.33 x 10(-5)nucleotide substitutions per site per year, respectively. A more precise estimate was obtained for the combined LTR-env data set, which was 7.06 x 10(-7)-1.38 x 10(-5)substitutions per site per year. We also note an interesting correlation between the occurrence of mutations in HTLV-1 and the age of the individual infected."

Changes in vitamin D levels is one of the factors associated with decreased bone mass. The objective of this study is to evaluate the low bone mass and altered vitamin D levels in PLWH who have not been exposed to antiretrovirals.

Its soluble form has been shown to bind, in vitro, to human T cells, a process that may carry a negative signal onto these cells. We recently described a novel lymphocyte population in human peripheral blood, a population that expresses an intracellular CD14-like antigen. This novel T-cell population, composed mainly of CD8 cells and of very few CD4 cells, was found to be greatly enhanced in asymptomatic, untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals. In the present study, we further characterized this cell population and found that it differed from other CD8 subpopulations associated with HIV infection such as CD8/CD38. In addition, we followed HIV patients under conditions of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and observed two groups of patients: patients in whom the CD14-like positive-testing T cells returned to normal within 1 to 3 months, and patients in whom it did not, in spite of a significant plasma HIV-RNA viral load decrease. Thus, this new CD14-like positive-testing lymphocyte population may represent an interesting and important component of the cellular events associated with HIV infection. On the basis of its modulation following HAART, we speculate that it may be used, in the future, as a drug-monitoring cellular marker in antiretroviral treatment."

Suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy is clearly the most common cause of virologic failure of HAART regimens. Given the critical role of adherence in successful antiretroviral therapy, it is essential that providers of care for patients with HIV infection have a strategy that proactively assists and supports their patients' efforts to adhere to medication regimens. This review endeavors to provide a clinically focused approach to optimizing adherence of patients to HAART."

In the industrialised world, this has led to an increase in severe illness associated with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and, in the developing world, to doubling of tuberculosis cases in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The interaction with Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs when the CD4 count is relatively high (> 200) and tuberculosis (TB) is now the commonest presenting AIDS defining disease in Africa. In international public health terms the interaction between TB and HIV infection has led to the World Health Organisation declaring TB to be a global emergency. Both TB and HIV are diseases of poverty and the key to the reduction of incidence of both diseases is the improvement of socio-economic conditions. Other control methods are case finding and treatment, chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccination. Finding active (sputum positive) case of tuberculosis and treating them is the function of TB control programmes in all countries, but poor adherence to medication has lead to low cure rates and increasing development of drug resistance. Resources are needed to improve adherence to medication and for research to improve diagnostic methods and treatment."

CD8(+) T cells play a critical role in combating HTNV infections. However, the contributions of different CD8(+) T cell subsets to the immune response against viral infection are poorly understood. Here, we identified a novel subset of CD8(+) T cells characterized by the CD8(low) CD100(-) phenotype in HFRS patients. The CD8(low) CD100(-) subset accounted for a median of 14.3% of the total CD8(+) T cells in early phase of HFRS, and this percentage subsequently declined in the late phase of infection, whereas this subset was absent in healthy controls. Furthermore, the CD8(low) CD100(-) cells were associated with high activation and expressed high levels of cytolytic effector molecules and exhibited a distinct expression profile of effector CD8(+) T cells (CCR7(+/-) CD45RA(-) CD127(high) CD27(int) CD28(low) CD62L(-)). When stimulated with specific HTNV nucleocapsid protein-derived peptide pools, most responding CD8(+) cells (gamma interferon [IFN-γ] positive and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α] positive) were CD8(low) CD100(-) cells. The frequency of CD8(low) CD100(-) cells among HTNV-specific CD8(+) T cells was higher in milder cases than in more severe cases. Importantly, the proportion of the CD8(low) CD100(-) subset among CD8(+) T cells in early phase of HFRS was negatively correlated with the HTNV viral load, suggesting that CD8(low) CD100(-) cells may be associated with viral clearance. The contraction of the CD8(low) CD100(-) subset in late phase of infection may be related to the consistently high expression levels of PD-1. These results may provide new insights into our understanding of CD8(+) T cell-mediated protective immunity as well as immune homeostasis after HTNV infection in humans."

We investigated the possible immunologic basis of this interaction by comparing older (>/=45 years) and younger (</=30 years) HIV-infected adults with simultaneously enrolled, aged-matched, healthy volunteers. Cross-sectional comparisons suggested age-associated reductions in naive CD8(+) cells and in the expression of CD28(+) on CD8(+) cells among both HIV-infected subjects and control subjects. Opposite patterns of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell differences were apparent between these subject groups. HIV infection, but not age, was associated with impairments in delayed-type hypersensitivity responses, lymphoproliferation, and spontaneous apoptosis and with alterations in expression of chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. Reduced thymic volumes were associated with age and with HIV infection among younger, but not older, subjects. Because of their common association with age and HIV disease, naive CD8(+) cell depletion, diminished CD28 expression on CD8(+) cells, and reduced thymic volumes are possible correlates of the interaction of age with HIV disease."
Doc No.122,6416,positive/labeled,13.179114,High levels of human immunodeficiency virus infection of CD8 lymphocytes expressing CD4 in vivo.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected CD8 lymphocytes have been reported in vivo, but the mechanism of infection remains unclear. Experiments using the thy/hu mouse model support export of intrathymically infected CD8 precursors, while recent in vitro data suggest that mature CD8 lymphocytes upregulate CD4 upon activation (generating a CD8bright CD4dim phenotype) and are susceptible to HIV infection. To determine whether these mechanisms operate in vivo and to assess their relative importance in the generation of circulating HIV-infected CD8 lymphocytes, we quantified HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) DNA in CD8+ CD4- and CD8bright CD4dim lymphocytes isolated from HIV-infected individuals by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. HIV infection of CD8 lymphocytes was demonstrated in 17 of 19 subjects, with a significant inverse relationship between level of infection and CD4 lymphocyte count (R = -0.73; P < 0.001). The level of HIV infection of CD8bright CD4dim lymphocytes was significantly higher (median, 1,730 HIV LTR copies/10(6) cells; n = 9) than that of CD8+ CD4- lymphocytes (undetectable in seven of nine individuals; P < 0.01) and approached that of CD4 lymphocytes from the same individuals (median, 3,660 HIV LTR copies/10(6) cells). CD8bright CD4dim lymphocytes represented 0.8 to 3.3% of total CD8 lymphocytes and were most prevalent in the memory subset. Thus, HIV-infected CD8 lymphocytes commonly circulate in HIV-infected individuals and are generated through infection of activated CD8 lymphocytes rather than through export of intrathymically infected precursors. The high level of infection of CD8bright CD4dim lymphocytes could have a direct role in the decline in CD8 lymphocyte function that accompanies HIV disease progression."

This study sought to examine these issues among a key population at risk of HIV infection, substance-using men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted semi-structured interviews with an ethnically diverse sample of 30 young (aged 20-35) MSM prescribed PrEP within a large integrated healthcare system in San Francisco, who had reported recent drug use or hazardous drinking and one or more missed doses of PrEP. We explored participants' risk perception and sexual risk behavior, drug and alcohol use, and PrEP adherence in the context of substance use. Interviews were transcribed and coded using a directed content analysis approach to identify key categories and commonalities, and differences across participants. Salient subcategories included positive psychological effects of being on PrEP (e.g., decreased anxiety, feelings of empowerment), social effects (e.g., reduced HIV stigma), and reduction in overall perceptions of HIV risk. While overall reported use of condoms went down and many reported a brief period of increased condomless sex following PrEP initiation, others continued condom use with most of their sexual partners. Contextual factors influencing their decision to engage in condomless sex included how well they knew the partner and whether the partner was on PrEP or HIV antiretroviral treatment. Factors associated with poor adherence included disruptions in daily routine and use of alcohol and methamphetamine. PrEP-prescribing clinicians should support their patients in making informed decisions about condom use and identifying strategies to maximize adherence in the context of substance use."

Two HIV-1(LAI) RT regions encompassing mutation M41L, L74V, M184V, and T215Y/F were recognized in 75 and 83% mutated and in 33 and 42% unmutated samples, respectively. A total of 41 new CTL epitopes overlapping these mutations were predicted. Mutations enhanced HLA-binding scores of 17 epitopes, decreased scores of 5, and had no effect in 19. Four predicted epitopes containing mutations 41, 74, and 184 were tested and recognized by CD8 cells from mutated or unmutated samples, with frequencies up to 270 gamma interferon spot-forming cells per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Therefore, RT mutations induced by NRTI can increase the immunogenicity of RT for CTL and might allow a better immune control of resistant viruses in vivo, suggesting that specific immune therapy might help prevent these mutations."

Other inflammatory disorders may occur in HTLV-I-infected patients, such as sicca syndrome resembling Sjögren's syndrome. The sicca syndrome may be the unique clinical manifestation of HTLV-I infection, but is associated frequently with TSP/HAM, which could suggest that sicca syndrome might be an early event in disease progression to TSP/HAM in some cases. We investigated whether peculiar pX and LTR mutations could be related to sicca syndrome, or might argue the existence of clinical progression to TSP/HAM. pX, especially pX(I), pX(II), and pX(IV) ORFs corresponding to Tax cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes, and LTR regions from Caribbean patients who have sicca syndrome with or without TSP/HAM, ATL patients, and healthy carriers were sequenced. The sequences were aligned and compared with ATK-1 prototype and published sequences. LTR sequences exhibited 1.5-2.4% of divergence with ATK-1. pX-sequenced regions showed a lower homology within p12(I) encoding sequences. Only few mutations were found within functionally important regions, but were not associated specifically with the clinical status. Finally, no mutations that could be related to sicca syndrome or argue the existence of clinical progression to TSP/HAM were found. It would be of interest to study the clinical evolution of HTLV-I-sicca syndrome in patients and to determine HTLV-I sequences from peripheral blood and salivary glands at different stages."
Doc No.126,7545,negative/unlabeled,13.099543,Prevalence and interactions of patient-related risks for nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy among perinatally infected youth in the United States.,"Adherence to antiretroviral regimens continues to be a significant problem in HIV-infected individuals facing a lifetime of therapy. Youth who were infected through perinatal transmission enter into adolescence often with a history of multiple medication regimens. Thus, adherence can be a particularly important issue in these young people, as medication options can often be limited. This was a cross-sectional, observational study to determine the prevalence of personal barriers to adherence and to identify associations among the following barriers in subjects 12 to 24 years old: mental health barriers, self-efficacy and outcome expectancy, and structural barriers. Among the 368 study participants, 274 (74.5%) were adherent and 94 (25.5%) were nonadherent to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). No significant differences were found between adherent and nonadherent subjects according to mental health disorders. Adherence was associated with some but not all structural barriers. Both self-efficacy and outcome expectancy were significantly higher in adherent versus nonadherent subjects (p < 0.0001). In subjects with low self-efficacy and outcome expectancy, adherence differed according to the presence or absence of either mental health or structural barriers, similar to findings in behaviorally- infected adolescents. Interventions that address the breadth and clustering of adherence barriers in adolescents are needed to have the maximum chance for positive effects."
Doc No.127,1286,negative/unlabeled,13.061908,Activation of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 long terminal repeat by respiratory burst oxidants of neutrophils.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) introduced in association with the luciferase reporter gene into Jurkat T cells was strongly activated by a combination of human neutrophils and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Activation was not observed when normal neutrophils were replaced by neutrophils which lack a respiratory burst, ie, from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), was strongly inhibited by catalase, was potentiated by vanadate, was stimulated by relatively low concentrations of azide, and was inhibited by selective inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC). The PMA affected activation in three ways: (1) by directly activating the LTR in Jurkat LTRluc; (2) by inducing a respiratory burst in neutrophils with the formation of H2O2; and (3) by increasing the sensitivity of Jurkat LTRluc to the activating effect of H2O2. When PMA was replaced by opsonized zymosan as the neutrophil stimulus, activation of the LTR was low unless azide was added. Activation in the presence of azide was not seen when CGD neutrophils were used or when catalase was added, suggesting that azide acts by inhibiting the degradation of H2O2. These findings indicate that activation of the HIV-1 LTR in Jurkat T cells can be induced by H2O2 released by neutrophils, particularly when PKC is concomitantly activated."
Doc No.128,1229,negative/unlabeled,13.015962,Induction of CD4 and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in human CD8+ T lymphocytes by human herpesvirus 6.,"During intrathymic T-cell ontogenesis, functionally competent CD3+CD4+CD8- and CD3+CD4-CD8+ T lymphocytes develop from immature CD4-CD8- thymocytes after transiently acquiring a double-positive CD4+CD8+ phenotype. The partition between CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ T cells is generally considered to be irreversible, although a small percentage of circulating CD3+ T lymphocytes coexpressing CD4 and CD8 molecules has been identified. It has been suggested that in CD8+ T cells the CD4 genes may be methylated and thus highly repressed, whereas in CD4+ T cells the CD8 genes are unmethylated and their transcription can be induced by physiological stimuli such as interleukin-4. Here, we demonstrate that infection with human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), a virus proposed as a potential cofactor in AIDS, dramatically upregulates the expression of CD4--the receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)--in a human neoplastic T-cell line. More importantly, HHV-6 induces de novo expression of CD4 messenger RNA and protein in normal mature CD8+ T lymphocytes, rendering them susceptible to infection with HIV-1. These findings demonstrate that human CD3+CD4-CD8+ T lymphocytes can reacquire CD4 in the post-thymic life and elucidate a novel mechanism--receptor regulation--through which HHV-6 may positively interact with HIV-1 in coinfected patients."

In this article, the authors provide a brief overview of the most common psychiatric complications associated with HIV infection and discuss the role of dopamine as a link between psychiatric manifestations and the progression of immunodeficiency infection."
Doc No.130,1316,negative/unlabeled,13.00952,Overview and implementation of an intervention to prevent adherence failure among HIV-infected adults initiating antiretroviral therapy: lessons learned from Project HEART.,"Project HEART, an acronym for Helping Enhance Adherence to Retroviral Therapy, was a prospective, controlled study to develop, implement, and evaluate a clinic-based behavioural intervention to prevent adherence failure among HIV-infected adults beginning their first highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen (N = 227). In this paper, we describe the conceptualisation of the Project HEART adherence intervention, characteristics of the participants, and lessons learned implementing HEART in an inner-city clinic setting. A multi-component intervention, HEART combined enhanced education, reminders, adherence feedback, social support and adherence-focused problem solving in an integrated manner to address common cognitive, motivational, and social barriers to adherence. Unique components of the intervention included use of participant-identified adherence support partners and a standardized adherence barriers assessment to develop and implement individualised adherence plans. Lessons learned regarding the feasibility of using participant-identified support partners were as follows. Few participants eligible for the study had trouble identifying a support partner. Over 90% of support partners attended at least one intervention visit. Support partners were most available and amenable to participate early in the initiation of therapy. Participants' experiences as the 'supported' partner were generally positive. Though many participants faced barriers not easily addressed by this intervention (for example, housing instability), formally integrating support partners into the intervention helped to address many other common adherence barriers. Family and friends are an under-utilised resource in HIV medication adherence. Enlisting the help of support partners is a practical and economical approach to adherence counselling."

Data on the frequency at which resistance mutations are detected in these patients are needed to support practical guidance on the use of resistance testing in this clinical situation. Furthermore, little is known about HIV subtype diversity in much of the United States. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence of drug resistance mutations and nonsubtype B strains of HIV among antiretroviral-naïve individuals presenting for HIV care in New York State between September 2000 and January 2004. Sequences were obtained using a commercial HIV genotyping assay. Seventeen of 151 subjects (11.3%; 95% confidence interval 7.2%-17.3%) had at least one drug-resistance mutation, including 5 subjects with fewer than 200 CD4(+) T cells, indicative of advanced infection. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor resistance mutations were detected in 6.6%, 5.3%, and 0.7% of subjects, respectively. Subjects from New York City-based clinics were less likely to have resistant virus than subjects from clinics elsewhere in New York State. Nonsubtype B strains of HIV were detected in 9 (6.0%) individuals and were associated with heterosexual contact. Two nonsubtype B strains from this cohort also carried drug-resistance mutations. These data indicate that drug-resistant virus is frequently detected in antiretroviral-naïve individuals entering HIV care in New York State. Furthermore, a diverse set of nonsubtype B strains were identified and evidence suggests that nonsubtype B strains, including those carrying drug-resistance mutations, are being transmitted in New York State."

In 2003, we developed a pilot program for HIV-infected adolescents and young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 who were either going to begin a HAART regimen for the first time or begin a new HAART regimen. Participants received a free cell phone with a local service plan for approximately 6 months. Participants received phone call reminders for 12 weeks. Call frequency was tapered at 4-week intervals. Patients were assessed at 4-week intervals to determine the perceived intrusiveness or helpfulness of receiving calls, and missed medication doses. Eight consecutive patients were recruited for the study, and five were able to complete it through the 24 weeks. Most participants found the calls to be helpful and the level of intrusion into their daily lives acceptable. Using cell phone reminders to assist patients does not require an extensive amount of daily staff time. Tapering calls rapidly over 3 months, followed by discontinuation of calls provided inadequate support for subjects, especially those with significant psychosocial issues such as substance abuse. Use of cell phone reminders to assist adolescents adhere with HIV medications was practical and acceptable to pilot study participants. Viral suppression waned for all but two patients after termination of cell phone reminders and suggests that a 12-week intervention was not adequate for most subjects. Larger prospective studies of cell phone observation of therapy will be needed to determine if this intervention can improve long-term adherence and health outcomes."

This study compares HIV-1 and HIV-2 in regard to the percentages of interleukin (IL)-2-, interferon (IFN)-gamma-, and IL-4-producing cells at the single-cell level, as determined by flow cytometry. At a given degree of CD4 T cell depletion, the frequency of T cells able to produce IL-2 is better preserved in HIV-2 than in HIV-1 infection, particularly within the CD4 T cell subset. As described for HIV-1 immunodeficiency, HIV-2-positive patients exhibit a marked expansion of terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells (CD28(-)CD27(-)IFN-gamma(+)). However, the proportion of CD8 T cells able to simultaneously produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma is higher in HIV-2 disease. Considering the central role of IL-2 as a lymphocyte proliferative and survival factor, these findings provide a possible immunologic basis for the distinct course of HIV-2 immunodeficiency."
Doc No.134,8762,positive/labeled,12.87732,Internet health information seeking behavior and antiretroviral adherence in persons living with HIV/AIDS.,"Abstract While the Internet has the potential to educate persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), websites may contain inaccurate information and increase the risk of nonadherence with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The objectives of our study were to determine the extent to which PLWHA engage in Internet health information seeking behavior (IHISB) and to determine whether IHISB is associated with ART adherence. We conducted a survey of adult, English-speaking HIV-infected patients at four HIV outpatient clinic sites in the United States (Baltimore, Maryland; Detroit, Michigan; New York, and Portland, Oregon) between December 2004 and January 2006. We assessed IHISB by asking participants how much information they had received from the Internet since acquiring HIV. The main outcome was patient-reported ART adherence over the past three days. Data were available on IHISB for 433 patients, 334 of whom were on ART therapy. Patients had a mean age of 45 (standard error [SE] 0.45) years and were mostly male (66%), African American (58%), and had attained a high school degree (73%). Most (55%) reported no IHISB, 18% reported some, and 27% reported ""a fair amount"" or ""a great deal."" Patients who reported higher versus lower levels of IHISB were significantly younger, had achieved a higher level of education, and had higher medication self-efficacy. In unadjusted analyses, higher IHISB was associated with ART adherence (odds ratio [OR], 2.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-6.94). This association persisted after adjustment for age, gender, race, education, clinic site, and medication self-efficacy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.76, 95% CI 1.11-6.87). Our findings indicate that IHISB is positively associated with ART adherence even after controlling for potentially confounding variables. Future studies should investigate the ways in which Internet health information may promote medication adherence among PLWHA."

Nine men who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 18 months of seroconversion and had sustained plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for at least 6 months were enrolled. Median age was 38 years, median pre-ART HIV-1 RNA was 140,000 copies/ml and mean baseline CD4 count was 755/μl. Two DNA, followed by 2 MVA, inoculations were given 8 weeks apart. Eight subjects completed all vaccinations and TI. Clinical and laboratory adverse events were generally mild, with no serious or grade 4 events. Only reactogenicity events were considered related to study drug. No treatment emergent viral resistance was seen. The vaccinations did not reduce viral reservoirs and virus re-emerged in all participants during TI, with a median time to re-emergence of 4 weeks. Eight of 9 participants had CD8+ T cells that could be stimulated by vaccine-matched Gag peptides prior to vaccination. Vaccinations boosted these responses as well as eliciting previously undetected CD8+ responses. Elicited T cells did not display signs of exhaustion. During TI, temporal patterns of viral re-emergence and Gag-specific CD8+ T cell expansion suggested that vaccine-specific CD8+ T cells had been stimulated by re-emergent virus in only 2 of 8 participants. In these 2, transient decreases in viremia were associated with Gag selection in known CD8+ T cell epitopes. We hypothesize that escape mutations, already archived in the viral reservoir, plus a poor ability of CD8+ T cells to traffic to and control virus at sites of re-emergence, limited the therapeutic efficacy of the DNA/MVA vaccine."

Assessments included patient-reported Medication Adherence Self-Report Inventory, SF-12v2 Quality of Life assessment, HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, and HIV Symptom Index Questionnaire through Week 48. Additional evaluations included study drug discontinuations due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). A total of 786 participants (n=394 RPV/FTC/TDF, n=392 EFV/FTC/TDF) were included. Fewer RPV/FTC/TDF-treated than EFV/FTC/TDF-treated participants discontinued study drug due to TEAEs (2.5% vs. 8.7%), with 41% (14/34) TEAE-related discontinuations in the EFV/FTC/TDF group occurring within the first four weeks of treatment. Treatment adherence and satisfaction remained high through Week 48 and quality of life improved from baseline in both groups. There were no significant between-group differences in virologic success (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) regardless of adherence (<95% or ≥95%). Significant between-group differences favouring RPV/FTC/TDF were observed for the HIV SIQ symptoms of difficulty falling or staying asleep (p = .022) and diarrhea or loose bowel movements (p = .002). In conclusion, 48-week treatment with RPV/FTC/TDF or EFV/FTC/TDF was associated with high adherence, high treatment satisfaction, and improved quality of life. TEAE-related discontinuations and patient-reported symptoms indicate that RPV/FTC/TDF may be somewhat better tolerated than EFV/FTC/TDF. "
Doc No.137,7758,negative/unlabeled,12.84428,Severe immunodeficiency associated with a human immunodeficiency virus 1 NEF/3'-long terminal repeat transgene.,"We have generated several transgenic mouse strains carrying a human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) NEF/3' long terminal repeat (LTR) transgene under control of a T cell-specific promoter-enhancer element, showing a depletion of CD4+ T cells in the thymus and periphery. The immunological functions of the line with the most dramatic changes in lymphocyte populations, B6/338L, were analyzed in greater detail. The presence of the transgene in the heterozygous animal is associated with a dominant severe immunodeficiency. Older animals develop lymph-adenopathy and splenomegaly. CD4+CD8+ and CD4+CD8- single positive thymocytes already are depleted in these mice at the earliest stages in ontogeny, and peripheral T cells are reduced in frequency and present cell surface marker expression, which is characteristic for memory and activated T cells. The immunological response of B6/338L mice to several viral infections is also greatly impaired. Thus, the HIV-1 NEF/3' LTR as transgene in T cells can cause immunodeficiency and disease with striking similarities to a known retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency called murine AIDS (H. C. Morse III, S. K. Chattopadhyay, M. Makino, T. N. Frederickson, A. W. Hügin, and J. W. Hartley. 1992. AIDS. 6:607)."

Here we evaluated the direct effects of HIV-1 Vpr-mediated immune modulation of infected T cells. Vpr specifically downregulated the expression of CD28 and increased the expression of CTLA-4, whereas no significant difference in the expression of CD25 and HLA-DR was observed. Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production in T cells was evaluated as a measure of the downstream effector functions. Results indicate that Vpr significantly inhibited IFN-gamma production and this may, in part, due to Vpr's ability to inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, and its transcriptional regulation. Together these results support that HIV-1 Vpr selectively dysregulates the immune functions at multiple levels and exerts its inhibitory effects in the presence of other viral proteins."

This cross-sectional study explored social and psychosocial factors associated with adherence among adolescents with perinatal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in Panama from a gender perspective. A questionnaire developed for the study was applied to 38 adolescent patients (20 female, 18 male; median age, 14 years). Thirty-two patients (86%; one missing response) still depended on an adult to remember taking their medication, among whom 28 relied on a female relative. Although 18 (47%) patients reported to become ill no more than once a year, only 10 (26%) patients showed an undetectable viral load, and 4 (11%) patients showed no CD4 suppression. Seventeen (45%) patients recalled correctly their medication. During the week prior to the interview, 26 patients (68%) reported that they had missed at least one dose. When asked the reason for missing a dose, 23 out of 34 (68%; 4 missing responses) patients responded, ""I forgot"". Female patients gave more excuses for missing doses (mean ± SD number of excuses per female, 2.4 ± 2; per male, 1.2 ± 1; p = .02), while more male than female patients described an action plan if they ran out of medication (13 vs. 8; p = .05). Educational programs involving patients and also family members are warranted to improve adherence."

This is particularly important given the tendency to individualise or use a blame discourse when exploring why HIV-infected patients ""fail"" to adequately adhere to ART, and not sufficiently exploring contextual reasons for poor adherence that may require varying solutions. This study took place at three clinics and one hospital in Khayelitsha, South Africa, to document the contextual factors that challenged ART adherence in this community. Interviews were conducted with 20 HIV-infected patients who had defaulted on their ART and were subsequently admitted to Khayelitsha hospital for clinical complications, and 9 ART service providers including doctors, nurses and HIV counsellors. Interviews assessed the reasons patients defaulted on ART and explored ways this could be prevented. Data from both groups were analysed collectively using thematic analysis. While the interviews revealed a landscape of environmental risks threatening adherence to ART, all patients managed to overcome the identified barriers at some point in their treatment phase, indicating the fluidity of patients' needs and decision making. Patients reported that distrustful relationships with service providers could inhibit their understanding of ART and/or interrupt their follow-up at clinics. Patients described their rationale and agency underlying non-adherence, such as testing their bodies' physical limits without ART medication. The study speaks to the need to appreciate contextual social and structural barriers related to ART adherence, and how these are negotiated differently by specific sub-groups, to support an appropriate response. It is imperative to not solely emphasise loss to follow-up but also assess patients' subjective trajectory of their ART journey, decision making and agency with adhering to ART, their relations with healthcare workers, and how these dynamics are intertwined with broader constraints in health systems."

However, development of drug resistance, which could be subsequently transmitted to the child, is a major concern. In Honduras and Belize the prevalence of drug resistance among HIV-1-infected children remains unknown. A total of 95 dried blood spot samples was obtained from HIV-1-infected, untreated children in Honduras and Belize born during 2001 to 2004, when preventive antiretroviral therapy was often suboptimal and consisted of monotherapy with nevirapine or zidovudine. Partial HIV-1 pol gene sequences were successfully obtained from 66 children (Honduras n=55; Belize n=11). Mutations associated with drug resistance were detected in 13% of the Honduran and 27% of the Belizean children. Most of the mutations detected in Honduras (43%) and all mutations detected in Belize were associated with resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which was expected from the wide use of nevirapine to prevent MTCT during the study period. In addition, although several mothers reported that they had not received antiretroviral therapy, mutations associated with resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors were found in Honduras. This suggests prior and unreported use of these drugs, or that these women had been infected with resistant virus. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, the presence of drug resistance-associated mutations in HIV-1-infected Honduran and Belizean children."

We predicted 66 CE in a Zambian acute infection cohort based on escape mutations occurring within or near the putatively predicted HLA-I-restricted epitopes. The CE were evaluated for CD8 T cell responses for patients with chronic and acute HIV infections. Of the 66 predicted CE, 10 were recognized in 8/32 and 4/11 patients with chronic and acute infections, respectively. The immunogenic CE were all derived from a single antisense reading frame within "
Doc No.143,4508,negative/unlabeled,12.662685,Synergistic reversal of intrahepatic HCV-specific CD8 T cell exhaustion by combined PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade.,"Viral persistence is associated with hierarchical antiviral CD8 T cell exhaustion with increased programmed death-1 (PD-1) expression. In HCV persistence, HCV-specific CD8 T cells from the liver (the site of viral replication) display increased PD-1 expression and a profound functional impairment that is not reversed by PD-1 blockade alone. Here, we report that the inhibitory receptor cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is preferentially upregulated in PD-1(+) T cells from the liver but not blood of chronically HCV-infected patients. PD-1/CTLA-4 co-expression in intrahepatic T cells was associated with a profound HCV-specific effector dysfunction that was synergistically reversed by combined PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade in vitro, but not by blocking PD-1 or CTLA-4 alone. A similar effect was observed in circulating HCV-specific CD8 T cells with increased PD-1/CTLA-4 co-expression during acute hepatitis C. The functional response to combined blockade was directly associated with CTLA-4 expression, lost with CD28-depletion and CD4-independent (including CD4(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs). We conclude that PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways both contribute to virus-specific T cell exhaustion at the site of viral replication by a redundant mechanism that requires combined PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade to reverse. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of virus-specific T cell dysfunction, and suggest that the synergistic effect by combined inhibitory receptor blockade might have a therapeutic application against chronic viral infection in vivo, provided that it does not induce autoimmunity."
Doc No.144,6487,negative/unlabeled,12.66237,Hyaluronic Acid-Based Biocompatible Supramolecular Assembly for Sustained Release of Antiretroviral Drug.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and its associated diseases continue to increase despite the progress in our understanding of HIV biology and the availability of a number of antiretroviral drugs. Adherence is a significant factor in the success of HIV therapy and current HIV treatment regimens require a combination of antiviral drugs to be taken at least daily for the remainder of a patient's life. A drug delivery system that allows sustained drug delivery could reduce the medical burden and costs associated with medication nonadherence. Here, we describe a novel supramolecular assembly or matrix that contains an anionic polymer hyaluronic acid, cationic polymer poly-l-lysine, and anionic oligosaccharide sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin. HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors Zidovudine and Lamivudine were successfully encapsulated into the polymer assembly in a noncovalent manner. The physicochemical properties and antiviral activity of the polymer assemblies were studied. The results of this study suggest that the supramolecular assemblies loaded with HIV drugs exert potent antiviral activity and allow sustained drug release. A novel drug delivery formulation such as the one described here could facilitate our efforts to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infections and could be utilized in the design of therapeutic approaches for other diseases."
Doc No.145,1549,negative/unlabeled,12.648939,Hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients: impact of direct-acting antivirals.,"Approximately 30% of HIV-infected patients are co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). After the release of highly active antiretroviral therapy, liver disease has become the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV patients. Prior to 2011, HCV treatment with pegylated-interferon and ribavirin in HCV/HIV co-infected patients only allowed 14-38% of patients with HCV genotype 1 to achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR). Additionally, treatment was commonly discontinued as a result of adverse events. Recently, simeprevir and sofosbuvir have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for HCV mono-infection. Sofosbuvir has been given FDA approval in co-infected patients offering unprecedented SVR rates and the potential for interferon-free therapy. HCV therapies that are in the pipeline offer improved treatment times, safety profiles, and rates of SVR. Despite these improvements, several new issues including adherence, drug-drug interactions with antiretroviral therapies, adverse events, resistance, and patient selection may complicate therapy. This article reviews the current status of direct-acting antivirals (DAA)-containing regimens for HIV/HCV co-infected patients in the USA. New results investigating telaprevir and boceprevir are also discussed as they are relevant for locations where new DAAs are not available. The impact future interferon-free therapies may have on co-infected patients is also discussed."
Doc No.146,7981,positive/labeled,12.646583,Acceptance and adherence with antiretroviral therapy among HIV-infected women in a correctional facility.,"We examined attitudinal and demographic correlates of antiretroviral acceptance and adherence among incarcerated HIV-infected women. Structured interviews were conducted with 102 HIV-infected female prisoners eligible for antiretroviral therapy. Three quarters of the women were currently taking antiretroviral agents, of whom 62% were adherent to therapy. Satisfaction was very high with the HIV care offered at the prison; 67% had been first offered antiretroviral agents while in prison. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed acceptance of the first offer of antiretroviral therapy to be associated with trust in medication safety, lower educational level, and non-black race. Current acceptance of therapy was associated with trust in the medication's efficacy and safety. Medication adherence was correlated with the patient-physician relationship and presence of emotional supports. Nearly one half of these HIV-seropositive women were willing to take experimental HIV medications in prison. This was correlated with satisfaction with existing health care, the presence of HIV-related social supports, and perceived susceptibility to a worsening condition. Acceptance and adherence with antiretroviral agents appear to be significantly associated with trust in medications, trust in the health care system, and interpersonal relationships with physicians and peers. Development of models of care that encourage and support such relationships is essential for improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy, especially for populations that have historically been marginalized from mainstream medical care systems."
Doc No.147,3117,negative/unlabeled,12.6090145,CD8+ T lymphocytes of patients with AIDS maintain normal broad cytolytic function despite the loss of human immunodeficiency virus-specific cytotoxicity.,"In this study, we have investigated the potential mechanisms responsible for the loss of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific cytolytic activity in the advanced stages of HIV-1 infection. We have demonstrated that HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are predominantly contained within the CD8+DR+ subset. Furthermore, we have shown by a redirected killing assay that there is a dichotomy between HIV-1-specific cytolytic activity and broad cytolytic potential since the cytolytic machinery of CD8+DR+ cells is still functioning even in patients with AIDS who have lost their HIV-1-specific cytolytic activity. In addition, by comparative analysis of these two types of cytolytic activity over time we have demonstrated a progressive loss of HIV-1-specific cytolytic activity in the advanced stages of the disease, whereas the cytolytic potential remained unchanged regardless of the clinical stage. As previously shown in patients with AIDS, even in asymptomatic HIV-1-seropositive patients, CD8+DR+ cells from the same patient, compared to CD8+DR- lymphocytes, showed a substantial reduction in their ability to proliferate in vitro in response to different stimuli, such as mitogens (phytohemagglutinin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) and monoclonal antibodies directed against CD3, CD2, and CD28 molecules, and displayed a defective clonogenic potential. Thus, on the basis of these results we propose that the loss of HIV-1-specific cytolytic activity in HIV-1-infected individuals may result at least in part from a progressive decrease in the pool of HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes belonging to the CD8+DR+ subset whose ability to expand has been impaired."
Doc No.148,9046,positive/labeled,12.584652,Factors associated with adherence to antiretroviral therapy in HIV/AIDS patients: a cross-sectional study in Southern Brazil.,"A cross-sectional study was conducted on HIV-infected adults being treated with antiretroviral drugs at a reference service in Southern Brazil. Participants answered a sociodemographic questionnaire and were tested by scales assessing sociocognitive variables. Adherence to treatment was assessed by a self-report inventory developed for the study. Clinical information was obtained from the patients' records. Significance tests were conducted using univariate logistic regressions followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 195 patients participated in the study and 56.9% of them reported > or = 95% adherence on the previous two days. In univariate analysis, the odds of adherence increased with self-efficacy (a person's conviction that he/she can successfully execute the behavior required to produce a certain desired outcome) in taking medications as prescribed (OR = 3.50, 95% CI 1.90-6.55), and decreased with perception of negative affect and physical concerns (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.95). The odds were lower for taking antiretroviral medications >4 times a day (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.20-0.94) and higher for patients with 8 years of schooling (OR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.12-4.66). In the multivariate analysis, self-efficacy (OR = 3.33, 95% CI 1.69-6.56) and taking medication >4 times a day (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.80) were independently associated with adherence. Self-efficacy was the most important predictor of adherence, followed by number of times antiretroviral medication was taken per day. Among sociodemographic and clinical variables, only the number of years of schooling was associated with adherence. Motivational interventions based on self-efficacy may be useful for increasing treatment adherence."

Previous data suggest that initial HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses are determined largely by viral and host genetics, but the mechanisms influencing the subsequent viral evolution are unclear. Here, we show a random recruitment of T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta clonotypes of the initial HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells during primary infection in two genetically identical twins infected simultaneously with the same virus, suggesting that stochastic TCR recruitment of HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells contributes to the diverse and unpredictable HIV-1 sequence evolution."

Activation of the LTR in Jurkat cells was strongly enhanced by vanadate and inhibited by catalase, implicating H2O2. In contrast, activation in THP-1 cells occurred in the absence of vanadate and was unaffected by catalase. The active material partitioned into the phenol layer on hot aqueous phenol extraction. Lactobacilli also increased tumor necrosis factor-alphaand interleukin-1betaproduction and activated NF-kappaB in THP-1 cells and increased tumor necrosis factor-alphaproduction by human monocytes. Human vaginal fluid specimens had comparable properties, which correlated with their bacterial content. These findings suggest the presence in vaginal fluid of agent(s) derived from indigenous bacteria that can activate the HIV-1 LTR, cytokine production, and NF-kappaB in cells of macrophage lineage, with possible influence on vaginal physiology and host defense."

Drug adherence and outcomes were assessed in a subset of patients suspected of treatment failure based on discordant clinical and immunologic responses to ART. A total of 913 patients were included in this analysis, with a median time of 744 days (Q1, Q3: 511, 919 days) from ART initiation to viral load (VL) measurement. On aggregate over the period of follow-up, 531 (58%) had optimal adherence (MPR > or =95%), 306 (34%) had suboptimal adherence (MPR 80-94%), and 76 (8%) had poor adherence (MPR <80%). Of the 913 patients, 238 (26%) had VL > or =400 copies/ml when tested. When compared to individuals with optimal adherence, there was increasing risk for virologic failure in those with suboptimal adherence [adjusted relative risk (ARR): 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, 1.6] and those with poor adherence (ARR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.4) based on MPR. During the antiretroviral treatment course, 676 patients (74%) reported no missed doses. The proportion of patients with virologic failure did not differ significantly among those reporting any missed dose from those reporting perfect adherence (26% vs. 26%, p = 0.97). Among patients with suspected treatment failure, a lower MPR was associated with higher rates of detectable viremia. However, the suboptimal sensitivity and specificity of MPR limit its utility as a sole predictor of virologic failure."

Multivirc Group.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) phenotypes and T cell repertoire in patients with HCV infection, with or without mixed cryoglobulinaemia (MC). The patients were: Group 1, 23 patients with HCV infection and MC; Group 2, 14 patients with HCV infection but without MC; Group 3, 10 patients with symptomatic essential MC. Twenty healthy blood donors were used as controls. Blood lymphocyte counts were determined, and flow cytometry was used to measure proportions of B cells (CD19+), natural killer (NK) cells (CD16+CD56+), T cells (CD3+), CD4+ T cell subsets (memory CD4+CD45RO+; naive CD4+CD45RO-; Th0/Th2CD4+CD7-; activated CD4+CD25+), and CD8+ T cell subsets (immunoregulatory CD8+CD57+; cytotoxic CD8+S6F1+, activated CD8+CD25+). Bias in the usage of T cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta chains was studied in a subgroup of 10 representative patients of Group 1 using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the Vbeta segments with a series of 20 oligonucleotides specific for the Vbeta families. The three groups were comparable for blood lymphocyte counts, and we observed no abnormal repartition of the following PBL subsets: T cells (CD3+), CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations, B cells (CD19+), and the NK cells (CD16+56+). In none of the groups could we observe lymphocyte ex vivo activation as assessed by the normal expression of the activation cell markers: CD25 on CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, or CD5 on B cells. The repartition of naive and memory (CD45RO-/RO+) CD4+ T cells was normal and we did not observe any amplification of the CD4+CD7- T cell subset differentiated in vivo in Th0/Th2 cells. There was no significant amplification of cytotoxic (SF6+) and immunoregulatory (CD57+) CD8+ T cells in HCV patients with or without MC. Finally, the usage of Vbeta families in the TCR repertoire was normal in the patients tested. In patients with chronic HCV infection, with or without MC, we did not find any significant expansion or abnormal activation of T, B and NK cell subsets, dysbalance of the naive/memory subsets, or expansion of the Th0/Th2 subpopulation. These findings differ from the profound immune alterations that are observed in other chronic infections such as HIV or Epstein-Barr virus. Although this study was restricted to the peripheral blood, it suggests that in chronic HCV infection, MC is not the consequence of a chronic activation or dysregulation of the peripheral blood immune cells."

The objective is to describe the standard of care received by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH/A) at enrollment into one of five Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Sites located along the U.S.-Mexico border. This cross-sectional study describes the presence of opportunistic infections (OIs), AIDS status and two types of standard of care received by 707 PLWH/A participating in SPNS. Patients receiving care through SPNS in one of the five sites between June 1, 2002 and December 31, 2003 were invited to participate to the medical chart review component of the study. The association between sociodemographic variables and the prevalence of OIs and AIDS at enrollment was estimated using multivariate hierarchical logistic models. More than one quarter of the 707 participants had at least one OI recorded and 58% of new and 60% of existing patients had AIDS at enrollment in SPNS. The association between being Hispanic and having higher prevalence of OI and AIDS at entry varied by SPNS site. Standard of care was well followed overall. This is the first study describing HIV stage and OI prevalences and standard of care in PLWH/A in all U.S.-Mexico bordering states.

This infection is self-limiting in healthy persons; however, it can be severe, progressive and persistent in those who are immunocompromised. There are few published studies concerning cryptosporidiosis and Cryptosporidium genotypes in Iranian immunocompromised patients and none of them describe risk factors. This study was undertaken to identify prevalence, genotypes and risk factors for cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised patients. Three fecal samples were obtained at two day intervals from each of the 183 patients and processed with modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining methods and 18S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. The overall infection prevalence was 6%. Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in isolates from five HIV-infected patients, one patient who had undergone bone marrow transplantation and one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cryptosporidium hominis was identified in isolates from two HIV-infected patients and two patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. According to univariate analysis, the statistically significant factors were diarrhea (OR = 21.7, CI = 2.83-78.4, P= 0.003), CD4 + lymphocytes less than 100 cells/mm(3) (OR = 41.3, CI = 13.45-114.8, P < 0.0001), other microbial infections (OR = 7.1321.7, CI = 1.97-25.73, P = 0.006), weight loss (OR = 73.78, CI = 15.5-350, P < 0.0001), abdominal pain (OR = 10.29, CI = 2.81-37.74.4, P= 0.001), dehydration (OR = 72.1, CI = 17.6-341.5, P < 0.0001), vomiting (OR = 4.87, CI = 1.4-16.9, P= 0.015), nausea (OR = 9.4, CI = 2.38-37.2, P < 0.001), highly active antiretroviral therapy (OR = 0.089, CI = 0.01-0.8, P= 0.015) and diarrhea in household members (OR = 7.37, CI = 2.04-26.66, P= 0.001). After multivariate analysis and a backward deletion process, only < 100 CD4 + T-lymphocytes/mm(3) maintained a significant association with infection.

Subjects were contacted prior to a scheduled appointment and asked to bring all their medications to the visit. Daily total pill burden and medication type were recorded. 151 subjects were recruited: 76% male, 58% African American, 97% receiving antiretrovirals (ARVs). Median age was 48 (IRQ: 42-54) years. The median number of medications per subject was 8 (IQR: 6-11), and the median individual daily pill burden was 8 pills (IQR: 5-15): 3 pills (range: 2-5) for ARVs and 6 (range: 3-12.5) pills for non-ARVs. Duration of ART (per 2 years increase) and more than 3 co-morbidities was significantly associated with high pill burden (over 10 pills per day) with adjusted OR of 2.09 (95% CI, 1.14-3.84) and 8.04 (95% CI, 2.30-28.15), respectively.

Two independent virus isolates, designated FIV-Petaluma and FIV-PPR, have been molecularly cloned and show greater than 85% sequence homology. Both clones (termed pF34 and pPPR) produce infectious virus after transfection of permissive feline cells. Basal promoter activity of the LTRs was measured in various cell lines in transient expression assays using plasmids containing the viral LTR linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Both LTRs were strong promoters in several cell lines, although in some cell lines the pF34 LTR had four- to fivefold higher basal activity than the pPPR LTR. FIV LTR mutations affecting the first AP4 site, AP1 site, ATF site, or NF-kappa B site resulted in decreased basal activity of the FIV promoter. Mutational analysis also revealed a negative regulatory element. In cotransfection experiments, both pF34 proviral DNA and pPPR proviral DNA appeared to transactivate either the pF34 LTR or the pPPR LTR; however, levels of transactivation were very low. Cotransfection of both LTRs with FIV subgenomic clones containing various viral open reading frames resulted in low level or no transactivation. The LTRs of both FIV clones responded to cell activation signals in human T-lymphoid cells (Jurkat) treated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. Promoter function of both FIV LTRs was also enhanced in cells treated with either forskolin, an inducer of intracellular cyclic-AMP (c-AMP), or dibutyryl c-AMP. Analysis of site-specific mutants showed that a potential AP1 site in the U3 domain of the LTR was required for T-cell activation responses mediated by protein kinase C, whereas a putative ATF site was the target for c-AMP-induced responses mediated by protein kinase A. These studies revealed that cellular transcription factors play a significant role in regulation of FIV gene expression."

In comparison to concordant patients, discordant patients showed poor lymphocyte proliferation, lower secretion of IL-2 and IFN-gamma, a lower percentage of perforin and granzyme-B-producing CD8 T cells, and poor differentiation of effector memory CD8 T(EM) cells into CD8 T(EMRA) cells in in-vitro stimulation assays, especially against HIV-1 Gag p24 and one of its peptide pools. Functional CD8 T-cell responses of discordant patients after stimulation with recall antigens, Candida albicans, and tetanus toxoid, were also inferior to concordant patients, but comparable to normal healthy controls. Examination of the multifunctional roles of T cells is imperative in describing the overall magnitude of immune responses to HIV-1. Our results suggest that prolonged suppression of plasma viremia alone does not warrant good qualitative and quantitative CD8 T-cell responses to HIV-1, implying that CD4 T cells are required for maintenance of protective CD8 T-cell responses."

VPA, which is an anti-epileptic drug in widespread use in clinical medicine, has been shown to depress the activity of GSH reductase, an enzyme required for maintaining high cellular levels of reduced GSH. The effect of this drug on HIV-1 replication has been studied in primary infected cells, i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocyte/macrophages, in the CEM-SS cell line, and in chronically infected stimulated and non-stimulated U1 cells. We have shown that VPA markedly enhanced viral replication in all infected cells tested. Virus production was induced in U1 cells by VPA treatment and the stimulatory effects of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor were augmented. The LTR-driven gene expression in Jurkat T cells was increased. However, the elevated viral production did not correlate with the effect of VPA on the intracellular GSH level. Thus, VPA stimulated in vitro HIV-1 replication in acutely and chronically infected cells and enhanced LTR-driven gene expression. These effects were observed for concentrations that are reached in the plasma of VPA-treated patients. Therefore, although the clinical significance of these data remains to be demonstrated, these results should be considered in the choice of an anticonvulsant drug in HIV-infected individuals."

However, the success of current HIV treatment programs depends not only on access to ART, but also on retention in care and good treatment adherence. This is necessary to achieve viral suppression, prevent virologic failure, and reduce viral transmission and HIV/AIDS-related deaths. Previous studies in Cameroon showed poor adherence, treatment interruption, and loss to follow-up among HIV+ subjects on ART, but the factors that influence ART adherence are not well known. In the current cross-sectional study, patient/self-reported questionnaires and pharmacy medication refill data were used to quantify ART adherence and determine the factors associated with increased risk of non-adherence among HIV-infected Cameroonians. We demonstrated that drug side-effects, low CD4 cell counts and higher viral loads are associated with increased risk of non-adherence, and compared to females, males were more likely to forego ART because of side effects (p<0.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that subjects with opportunistic infections (on antibiotics) had 2.42-times higher odds of having been non-adherent (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis controlling for ART regimen, age, gender, and education showed that subjects with opportunistic infections had 3.1-times higher odds of having been non-adherent (p<0.0003), with significantly longer periods of non-adherence, compared to subjects without opportunistic infections (p = 0.02). We further showed that compared to younger subjects (≤40 years), older subjects (>40 years) were less likely to be non-adherent (p<0.01) and had shorter non-adherent periods (p<0.0001). The presence of depression symptoms correlated with non-adherence to ART during antibiotic treatment (r = 0.53, p = 0.04), and was associated with lower CD4 cell counts (p = 0.04) and longer non-adherent periods (p = 0.04). Change in ART regimen was significantly associated with increased likelihood of non-adherence and increased duration of the non-adherence period. Addressing these underlying risk factors could improve ART adherence, retention in care and treatment outcomes for HIV/AIDS patients in Cameroon."

Poor medication knowledge 8 weeks after regimen initiation was associated with lower adherence and with a lower level of literacy in a multivariate model (P=.03). Because knowledge deficits are common after antiretroviral regimen initiation, clinicians should assess patients' understanding of medication dosing soon after regimen initiation or change."
Doc No.162,9175,negative/unlabeled,12.368534,Predicting sustained viral response to hepatitis C using a rapid and simple IL28B rs8099917 genotyping assay.,"Recent studies showed that two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs12979860 and rs8099917) near the gene IL28B coding for IFNλ3 were associated with the antiviral treatment response of the combination therapy of pegIFN plus RBV. We established the use of tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) for detecting IL28B rs8099917 genotype (T>G) in 56 Chinese chronic hepatitis C patients infected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1. The new assay showed 98.2% specificity, and was confirmed by direct sequencing. Among the 56 samples, TT genotype and TG genotype accounted for 80.4% (45/56) and 19.6% (11/56), respectively. GG genotype was not found. The proportion of responders in TT group was higher than that in TG group (68.9% vs. 27.3%, p=0.029). For HCV clinical decision-making, using the new assay, rs8099917 genotyping could provide similar information to rs12979860 genotyping due to a strong association between the two SNPs in Chinese patients. The assay system in this study can be implemented using basic laboratory equipments, making it convenient for clinical and research purposes."

The interest in anti-cryptosporidial IgA antibody response has been recently stimulated by studies on the therapeutic effects of secretory IgA antibodies to Cryptosporidium in animal models and in patients. In the present study, isotypes of serum anti-Cryptosporidium antibodies have been characterized in donors of the following categories: (a) healthy adults, (b) healthy children, (c) immunocompetent children with transient cryptosporidial diarrhea, (d) HIV-infected patients without clinical and parasitological evidence of Cryptosporidium infection and (e) AIDS patients with cryptosporidial diarrhea. Antibodies were detected using C. parvum oocysts purified by density gradient centrifugation from bovine faeces. The IgA antibodies were revealed using alpha-chain specific antibodies. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis with oocysts was used as control. Although high levels of serum antibodies of the IgA class were detected in some donors in the group of healthy adults, elevated values were consistently found in HIV-infected patients. Higher values were found in HIV patients with clinical cryptosporidiosis. The presence of a secretory component in serum IgA antibodies in these patients has been documented. Data indicate that IgA serum antibodies are produced as well as IgM and IgG antibodies upon contact with the parasite, and suggest that elevated IgA serum antibodies to Cryptosporidium are not associated with protection in HIV patients."
Doc No.164,8765,negative/unlabeled,12.341349,Successful application of hyperbranched multidisplacement genomic amplification to detect HIV-1 sequences in single neurons removed from autopsy brain sections by laser capture microdissection.,"To confirm studies suggesting that HIV-1 infects neurons and to determine whether CD8(+) T lymphocytes traffic to HIV-1-infected neurons, we used laser capture microdissection to remove hippocampal neurons with and without perineuronal CD8(+) T cells from AIDS patients with HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE) or without HIVE and from normal controls. We used hyperbranched multidisplacement amplification for whole gene amplification (MDA-WGA) plus two rounds of PCR to amplify housekeeping sequences (HK(+)) and, in HK(+) samples, to amplify HIV-1 gag, nef, and pol sequences. Sample size and, in single neurons, MDA-WGA correlated with housekeeping gene amplification (P < 0.05), whereas patient group and postmortem interval did not (P > 0.05). Neuronal viral sequences correlated with HIVE (43% vs. 13% and 0 in non-HIVE and controls, respectively) and, in HIVE cases, with perineuronal CD8(+) T lymphocytes (70% in CD8(+) samples vs. 37% of CD8(-) samples). Our results suggest that MDA-WGA is a useful technique when analyzing DNA from single cells from autopsy brains, supporting prior studies that show that neurons may contain HIV-1 neuronal sequences in vivo. The association between neuronal infection and perineuronal CD8(+) T cells supports our hypothesis that these cells specifically traffic to infected neurons but raises the possibility that CD8(+) T cells, if infected, could transmit virus to neurons."
Doc No.165,4652,negative/unlabeled,12.338609,Differential dynamics of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocyte proliferation and activation in acute simian immunodeficiency virus infection.,"Although lymphocyte turnover in chronic human immunodeficiency virus and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection has been extensively studied, there is little information on turnover in acute infection. We carried out a prospective kinetic analysis of lymphocyte proliferation in 13 rhesus macaques inoculated with pathogenic SIV. A short-lived dramatic increase in circulating Ki-67(+) lymphocytes observed at 1 to 4 weeks was temporally related to the onset of SIV replication. A 5- to 10-fold increase in Ki-67(+) CD8(+) T lymphocytes and a 2- to 3-fold increase in Ki-67(+) CD3(-) CD8(+) natural killer cells accounted for >85% of proliferating lymphocytes at peak proliferation. In contrast, there was little change in the percentage of Ki-67(+) CD4(+) T lymphocytes during acute infection, although transient increases in Ki-67(-) and Ki-67(+) CD4(+) T lymphocytes expressing CD69, Fas, and HLA-DR were observed. A two- to fourfold decline in CD4(+) T lymphocytes expressing CD25 and CD69 was seen later in SIV infection. The majority of Ki-67(+) CD8(+) T lymphocytes were phenotypically CD45RA(-) CD49d(hi) Fas(hi) CD25(-) CD69(-) CD28(-) HLA-DR(-) and persisted at levels twofold above baseline 6 months after SIV infection. Increased CD8(+) T-lymphocyte proliferation was associated with cell expansion, paralleled the onset of SIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity, and had an oligoclonal component. Thus, divergent patterns of proliferation and activation are exhibited by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes in early SIV infection and may determine how these cells are differentially affected in AIDS."

Participants were 73 men and women with HIV infection drawn from a larger sample of 186 clinical trial patients. Based on inclusion criteria, parent trial participants taking antiretroviral therapies, and those with complete data on self-reported measures of adherence were considered eligible for the present study. Overall, 26% of participants were found to be nonadherent, which was defined as one or more missed doses of treatment in the prior 4-day period. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine associations of sociodemographic and psychosocial variables with adherence to antiretroviral regimen. Results indicated that heterosexual participants (p < 0.01) and participants of Latino ethnicity (p < 0.05) were significantly more likely to report missed medications. Perceived satisfaction with support from a partner was associated with taking antiretroviral therapy as prescribed, whereas satisfaction with support from friends and from family was not significantly related to adherence. Examination of coping strategies showed that participants reporting drug and alcohol use (p <.05) to cope with HIV-related stress were more likely to be nonadherent. These findings call for adherence interventions designed to address barriers and strengths, such as community norms or traditional cultural values, specific to certain populations. Furthermore, couple-based approaches enlisting partner support may help persons living with HIV to adhere to antiretroviral regimens."
Doc No.167,3340,positive/labeled,12.288495,Factors associated with adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy in homeless or unstably housed adults living with HIV.,"The aim of this study is to investigate adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who are homeless or unstably housed. We evaluated homeless or unstably housed PLWHA (n=644) in three US cities were enrolled in the Housing and Health Study. Using baseline data and controlling for gender, race, age, and education, we examined associations between self-reported two- and Seven-day adherence and access to healthcare, mental health, substance use, and attitudes toward HIV medical therapy. Of the 644 participants, 358 (55%) were currently on HAART. For two-day adherence, 280 (78%) reported missing no prescribed doses (100% adherence), and for seven-day adherence, 291 (81%) reported > or =90% adherence. Logistic regression analyses indicated being younger, not having health insurance, and drug use were associated with missing > or =1 dose over the past two days. Scoring lower on SF-36 mental component summary scale and having greater risk of depression (CES-D) and stress (Perceived Stress Scale) were associated with poorer adherence for both two- and seven-day outcomes. Negative attitudes toward HIV treatment were also associated with lower adherence. Adherence to HIV medications in this population is similar to other groups. Coexisting problems of access to healthcare, higher risk of mental health problems, along with poorer attitudes toward treatment are associated with increased likelihood of missing doses. Comprehensive models of HIV care that include a continuum of medical and social services are essential for treating this population."
Doc No.168,1530,negative/unlabeled,12.288116,Human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection protects against a Tc1-to-Tc2 shift in CD8(+) T cells.,"Despite the reports of dysfunction of the lytic abilities of CD8(+) T cells during human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) disease progression, the effects of infection on the noncytolytic functions of CD8(+) T cells have not been well characterized to date. We examined the effect of HIV-1 infection on the cytokine and chemokine responses of peripheral blood-derived CD8(+) T cells in an in vitro system. Activation of HIV-1-infected CD8(+) T cells with phytohemagglutinin resulted in a 4- to 8-fold increase in the production of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted, and interleukin (IL)-16. Treatment of activated HIV-1-infected CD8(+) T cells with anti-CD3 monoclonal (M) antibody (Ab) and IL-15 induced strong production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Treatment of cells with anti-IL-12 MAb and IL-4 to induce a Tc1-to-Tc2 shift resulted in no change in viral production levels or IFN-γ production within the HIV-1-infected CD8(+) T cell population. Initiation of a Tc2-to-Tc1 shift resulted in a 6-fold increase in HIV-1 replication and 2- to 3-fold higher levels of IFN-γ, demonstrating that infection can protect against a Tc1-to-Tc2 shift in CD8(+) T cells."

The aim of this study is to review 20 HPs infected with a common source of virus. The enrolled patients have been consecutively treated with Korean red ginseng (KRG), zidovudine (ZDV) or two-drug therapy and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We determined full-length pol gene over 20 years and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I with peripheral blood mononuclear cells and reviewed medical records. Eighteen HPs experienced various opportunistic infections or clinical manifestations. There were significant inverse correlations between the HLA prognostic score and the annual decrease in CD4+ T-cell counts prior to HAART (AD) (P < 0.05) and the amount of KRG and the AD (P < 0.01). From 1998, the HPs had been treated with HAART. Each of the two patients died without and with HAART regimen respectively. At present, 16 HPs have been alive with HAART. Among the 16 HPs, 12 and 4 are on HAART-plus-KRG and HAART only respectively. Eleven HPs including 2 HPs with G-to-A hypermutations had revealed resistance mutations. Ten and two HPs have shown poor adherence and incomplete viral suppres-sion on HAART respectively. Virological failure based on WHO guidelines was not observed on KRG-plus-HAART. Two HPs revealed additional resistance mutations against two classes on KRG-plus-HAART. As a nationwide study, we first report overall features on clinical course of Korean haemophiliacs. Further education on the importance of drug adherence is needed."
Doc No.170,8023,negative/unlabeled,12.266369,Conditional Immune Escape during Chronic Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Infection.,"Anti-HIV CD8 T cells included in therapeutic treatments will need to target epitopes that do not accumulate escape mutations. Identifying the epitopes that do not accumulate variants but retain immunogenicity depends on both host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genetics and the likelihood for an epitope to tolerate variation. We previously found that immune escape during acute SIV infection is conditional; the accumulation of mutations in T cell epitopes is limited, and the rate of accumulation depends on the number of epitopes being targeted. We have now tested the hypothesis that conditional immune escape extends into chronic SIV infection and that epitopes with a preserved wild-type sequence have the potential to elicit epitope-specific CD8 T cells. We deep sequenced simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCMs) that were homozygous and heterozygous for the M3 MHC haplotype and had been infected with SIV for about 1 year. When interrogating variation within individual epitopes restricted by M3 MHC alleles, we found three categories of epitopes, which we called categories A, B, and C. Category B epitopes readily accumulated variants in M3-homozygous MCMs, but this was less common in M3-heterozygous MCMs. We then determined that chronic CD8 T cells specific for these epitopes were more likely preserved in the M3-heterozygous MCMs than M3-homozygous MCMs. We provide evidence that epitopes known to escape from chronic CD8 T cell responses in animals that are homozygous for a set of MHC alleles are preserved and retain immunogenicity in a host that is heterozygous for the same MHC alleles."

These patients were followed for 4-7 months. NK activity, HIV-env-specific CTL activities mediated by CD4+, CD8+ T cells and CD8+CD11+ T-suppressor cell number remained stable in seven patients during the study period. Alternatively, NK and HIV-specific CTL activities decreased and CD8+CD11+ cell number increased in five patients whose CD4+ T-cell number fell, and in four of these five patients serum p24 antigen level increased, and they developed minor clinical signs of disease progression during the study period. CD8+CD11+ cells are present in higher percentage (10-45% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells) in these HIV-infected patients as compared to those in normal individuals (3-5%). Our results suggest that CD8+CD11+ cells, NK, and HIV-specific cytotoxic activities may be helpful in monitoring prognosis of HIV infection. These observations also suggest that CD8+CD11+ cells may play an important role in the failure of host immune defences against HIV."
Doc No.172,306,negative/unlabeled,12.242267,Constrained pattern of viral evolution in acute and early HCV infection limits viral plasticity.,"Cellular immune responses during acute Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infection are a known correlate of infection outcome. Viral adaptation to these responses via mutation(s) within CD8+ T-cell epitopes allows these viruses to subvert host immune control. This study examined HCV evolution in 21 HCV genotype 1-infected subjects to characterise the level of viral adaptation during acute and early HCV infection. Of the total mutations observed 25% were within described CD8+ T-cell epitopes or at viral adaptation sites. Most mutations were maintained into the chronic phase of HCV infection (75%). The lack of reversion of adaptations and high proportion of silent substitutions suggests that HCV has structural and functional limitations that constrain evolution. These results were compared to the pattern of viral evolution observed in 98 subjects during a similar phase in HIV infection from a previous study. In contrast to HCV, evolution during acute HIV infection is marked by high levels of amino acid change relative to silent substitutions, including a higher proportion of adaptations, likely reflecting strong and continued CD8+ T-cell pressure combined with greater plasticity of the virus. Understanding viral escape dynamics for these two viruses is important for effective T cell vaccine design."

Recent advances in the functional characterization of host molecules inserted into mature virus particles have revealed that HIV-1 biology is influenced by the acquisition of host cell membrane components. The CD28/B7 receptor/ligand system is considered one of the fundamental elements of the normal immune response. Two major cell types that harbor HIV-1 in vivo, i.e., monocytes/macrophages and CD4+ T cells, express the costimulatory molecules CD80 (B7.1) and CD86 (B7.2). We investigated whether CD80 and CD86 are efficiently acquired by HIV-1, and if so, whether these host-encoded molecules can contribute to the virus life cycle. Here we provide the first evidence that the insertion of CD80 and CD86 into HIV-1 increases virus infectivity by facilitating the attachment and entry process due to interactions with their two natural ligands, CD28 and CTLA-4. Moreover, we demonstrate that NF-kappaB is induced by CD80- and CD86-bearing virions when they are combined with the engagement of the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex, an event that is inhibited upon surface expression of CTLA-4. Finally, both CD80 and CD86 were found to be efficiently incorporated into R5- and X4-tropic field strains of HIV-1 expanded in cytokine-treated macrophages. Thus, besides direct interactions between the virus envelope glycoproteins and cell surface constituents, such as CD4 and some specific chemokine coreceptors, HIV-1 may attach to target cells via interactions between cell-derived molecules incorporated into virions and their natural ligands. These findings support the theory that HIV-1-associated host proteins alter virus-host dynamics."

HIV-QUERI Executive Committee.,"The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) sees approximately equal to 17,000 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients each year, which makes it the largest provider of HIV care in the United States. HIV causes chronic progressive disease that leads to early death. Newer combination antiretro viral treatments are effective but expensive and difficult to use. The HIV Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (HIV-QUERI) uses the QUERI process to identify high-risk and high-volume populations (step 1), which includes those already under VHA care for HIV, those who do not know of their infection, and those at risk for HIV. In identifying best practices (step 2), the HIV-QUERI will benefit greatly from existing guidelines for the care of established HIV infection, but gaps in knowledge regarding adherence to medication regimens and cost-effective screening are large. To identify existing practice patterns (step 3), the HIV-QUERI will develop a clean analytic data set based on Immunology Case Registry files and expand it through a survey of veterans. Interventions to improve care (step 4) will include national, regional, and site-specific feedback on performance relative to quality standards, as well as patient-level and provider-level interventions to improve adherence and support medical decision-making. To document that best practices improve outcomes and quality of life (steps 5 and 6), HIV-QUERI will track indicators on an ongoing basis by use of the Immunology Case Registry database and possible future waves of the survey. In addition, we will require that these issues be addressed in evaluations of HIV-QUERI interventions. In the present article, we present these steps within a framework and plan."
Doc No.175,3156,positive/labeled,12.179322,Discordant outcomes following failure of antiretroviral therapy are associated with substantial differences in human immunodeficiency virus-specific cellular immunity.,"Many individuals chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) experience a recrudescence of plasma virus during continuous combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) due either to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses or to poor compliance. In most cases, virologic failure on ART is associated with a coincident decline in CD4(+) T lymphocyte levels. However, a proportion of discordant individuals retain a stable or even increasing CD4(+) T lymphocyte count despite virological failure. In order to address the nature of these different outcomes, we evaluated virologic and immunologic variables in a prospective, single-blinded, nonrandomized cohort of 53 subjects with chronic HIV-1 infection who had been treated with continuous ART and monitored intensively over a period of 19 months. In all individuals with detectable viremia on ART, multiple drug resistance mutations with similar impacts on viral growth kinetics were detected in the pol gene of circulating plasma virus. Further, C2V3 env gene analysis demonstrated sequences indicative of CCR5 coreceptor usage in the majority of those with detectable plasma viremia. In contrast to this homogeneous virologic pattern, comprehensive screening with a range of antigens derived from HIV-1 revealed substantial immunologic differences. Discordant subjects with stable CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts in the presence of recrudescent virus demonstrated potent virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. In contrast, subjects with virologic failure associated with declining CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts had substantially weaker HIV-specific CD4(+) T lymphocyte responses and exhibited a trend towards weaker HIV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. Importantly the CD4(+) response was sustained over periods as long as 11 months, confirming the stability of the phenomenon. These correlative data lead to the testable hypothesis that the consequences of viral recrudescence during continuous ART are modulated by the HIV-specific cellular immune response."

Here we examined gamma interferon-positive, HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses and autologous viral sequences in an HIV-1-infected individual for more than 6 years following acute infection. Fourteen optimal HIV-1 T-cell epitopes were targeted by CD8(+) T cells, four of which underwent mutation associated with dramatic loss of the original CD8(+) response. However, following the G(357)S escape in the HLA-A11-restricted Gag(349-359) epitope and the decline of wild-type-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses, a novel CD8(+) T-cell response equal in magnitude to the original response was generated against the variant epitope. CD8(+) T cells targeting the variant epitope did not exhibit cross-reactivity against the wild-type epitope but rather utilized a distinct T-cell receptor Vbeta repertoire. Additional studies of chronically HIV-1-infected individuals expressing HLA-A11 demonstrated that the majority of the subjects targeted the G(357)S escape variant of the Gag(349-359) epitope, while the wild-type consensus sequence was significantly less frequently recognized. These data demonstrate that de novo responses against escape variants of CD8(+) T-cell epitopes can be generated in chronic HIV-1 infection and provide the rationale for developing vaccines to induce CD8(+) T-cell responses directed against both the wild-type and variant forms of CD8 epitopes to prevent the emergence of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte escape variants."

However, the relationship between these genetic variants and survival of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC is still unknown. In this study, 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped among 330 HBV-related HCC patients using the MassARRAY system from Sequenom. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the effects of genotype on survival time under an additive model with age, sex, smoking status and clinical stage as covariates. We identified four SNPs on 6p21 (rs1419881 T>C, rs7453920 G>A,rs3997872 G>A and rs7768538 T>C), and two SNPs on 8p12 (rs2275959 C>T and rs7821974 C>T) significantly associated with survival time of HBV-related HCC patients. Our results suggest that HCC or CHB susceptibility loci might also affect the prognosis of patients with HBV-related HCC. "

We investigated the existence of opportunistic protozoans that significantly affect the quality of life in HIV-1 infected patients using conventional and molecular methods. The study group comprised 115 HIV-1 positive patients. In the identification of Cyclospora cayetanensis and Cryptosporidium, the formol-ether precipitation method was used and smears were evaluated in optical microscope by staining modified Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN). The primers and probes used for PCR were Heat shock protein 70 for C. cayetanensis and the oocysts wall protein for Cryptosporidium spp.. Cyclospora and Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were detected in one and two patients, respectively, by staining, whereas we detected C. cayetanensis in three patients out of 115 (2.6%) by PCR, and Cryptosporidium spp. in a further three patients (2.6%). C. cayetensis was detected in patients with CD4 counts of 64 cells/μm, 182 cells/μm and 287 cells/μm, respectively. Cryptosporidium spp. was detected in patients with CD4 counts of 176 cells/μm, 241 cells/μm and 669 cells/μm. As conclusion, PCR method is faster and more sensitive than microscopic methods and to screen intestinal pathogens routinely in patients infected with HIV should not be neglected in developing countries like Turkey."
Doc No.180,1084,negative/unlabeled,12.13426,Highly potent RANTES analogues either prevent CCR5-using human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in vivo or rapidly select for CXCR4-using variants.,"The natural ligands for the CCR5 chemokine receptor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), MIP-1beta, and RANTES (regulated on T-cell activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted), are known to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry, and N-terminally modified RANTES analogues are more potent than native RANTES in blocking infection. However, potent CCR5 blocking agents may select for HIV-1 variants that use alternative coreceptors at less than fully inhibitory concentrations. In this study, two N-terminal chemical modifications of RANTES produced by total synthesis, aminooxypentane (AOP)-RANTES[2-68] and N-nonanoyl (NNY)-RANTES[2-68], were tested for their ability to prevent HIV-1 infection and to select for coreceptor switch variants in the human peripheral blood lymphocyte-SCID mouse model. Mice were infected with a CCR5-using HIV-1 isolate that requires only one or two amino acid substitutions to use CXCR4 as a coreceptor. Even though it achieved lower circulating concentrations than AOP-RANTES (75 to 96 pM as opposed to 460 pM under our experimental conditions), NNY-RANTES was more effective in preventing HIV-1 infection. However, in a subset of treated mice, these levels of NNY-RANTES rapidly selected viruses with mutations in the V3 loop of envelope that altered coreceptor usage. These results reinforce the case for using agents that block all significant HIV-1 coreceptors for effective therapy."
Doc No.181,6681,positive/labeled,12.127063,Influence of viral chronic hepatitis co-infection on plasma drug concentrations and liver transaminase elevations upon therapy switch in HIV-positive patients.,"It is still controversial whether viral hepatitis co-infection can influence antiretroviral plasma drug concentrations and whether drug concentrations are correlated with liver enzyme elevations during highly active antiretroviral therapy. An analysis of data from a cohort of 220 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients was conducted. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were performed to identify predictors of plasma drug concentrations. The association of transaminase elevation with higher plasma drug concentrations was explored following stratification of patients into HIV monoinfected and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infected groups. Hepatitis co-infections were independently correlated with drug concentrations above the therapeutic cut-offs at Week 1 (P=0.06), Week 4 (P=0.04) and Week 12 (P=0.005). The apparent effect was independent of the possible impact exerted by other variables such as demographics and medication adherence. The incidence of relevant hypertransaminasaemia was low. Patients with hepatitis co-infections had higher rates of transaminase elevation than monoinfected HIV patients; however, risk of transaminase elevation was not associated with drug concentrations. The presence of HCV and/or HBV co-infections correlated with higher plasma drug concentrations, although it did not appear to influence hepatotoxicity risk."
Doc No.182,3808,positive/labeled,12.07222,Factors associated with sexual dysfunction in men with HIV infection.,"Where men have had access to successful treatment for HIV (highly active antiretroviral therapy), expectations of both patients and physicians alike have changed significantly over the past decade. Such men, living with HIV, expect to lead fully functional lives including a normal sex life. Sexual dysfunction is well described among men with HIV. We retrospectively analysed details of 190 consecutive men attending a dedicated sexual dysfunction service in our HIV unit over an 18-month period. We took note of the specifics of their HIV disease, illnesses other than HIV, as well as other risk factors associated with sexual dysfunction. Men with sexual dysfunction all commonly reported recreational drug use, hepatitis B and C co-infection, anxiety and depressive illnesses, peripheral neuropathy and lipodystrophy. There was a significant relationship between men complaining of retarded ejaculation and peripheral neuropathy. Sexual dysfunction in non-HIV settings is known to lead to poor adherence to prescribed medications, e.g. antihypertensive agents. Iatrogenic sexual dysfunction in patients may similarly have a potential to lead to poor antiretroviral compliance if not addressed."
Doc No.183,3782,negative/unlabeled,12.065522,Viral phenotype and immune response in primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.,"Nineteen individuals were studied for virologic and immunologic events during primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. In 16 individuals only non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) isolates were detected; syncytium-inducing (SI) isolates were obtained from 3. Studies of transmitter-recipient pairs indicated that both NSI variants and SI variants were transmitted and that SI variants may be suppressed in the recipient. CD4+ T cells remained in the normal range in 15 of 16 individuals with NSI isolates but rapidly declined in all 3 individuals with SI variants, 1 of whom was treated with zidovudine. The most marked increase in CD8+ T cells and activated CD8+ T cells was observed in individuals with the most pronounced clinical signs of acute HIV-1 infection. Activated CD8+ T cells were only transiently elevated in individuals with SI variants, suggesting that an impaired cellular anti-HIV-1 immune response plays a role in the rapid progression to AIDS."
Doc No.184,8385,negative/unlabeled,12.061701,Factors Contributing to the Antiviral Effectiveness of Tenofovir.,"Over 1 million people in the United States are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which may progress to AIDS. The use of antiviral therapy has successfully controlled the rate of viral growth in patients. Antiviral agents improve the quality of life and reduce the potential for spreading HIV; HIV is currently considered a chronic disease provided patients are compliant with their antiviral medications. Tenofovir is a nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor that prevents viral replication and is approved for treatment of HIV and chronic hepatitis B infection. Tenofovir is an antiretroviral drug used alone and in combination with other nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor agents to lower viral load in HIV patients. Tenofovir is administered as a prodrug to increase bioavailability. The prodrug forms of tenofovir are tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, approved in 2001, and tenofovir alafenamide, approved in 2016. Tenofovir is extensively used in controlling HIV, as it is administered once daily, allowing for good compliance. This minireview discusses the impact of food, age, and drug transporters on tenofovir absorption and clearance. The changes in dosing that are needed in the presence of renal impairment, which is a common occurrence with HIV chronic disease progression, will also be discussed. The potential special conditions occurring with fixed-combination doses containing tenofovir will also be reviewed, including the use of cobicistat, a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor. The short review also addresses some newer preparations using niosomes to improve tenofovir absorption and delivery to the target cells."
Doc No.185,8880,negative/unlabeled,12.054232,Anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) CD8(+) T-lymphocyte reactivity during combination antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected patients with advanced immunodeficiency.,"The long-term efficacy of combination antiretroviral therapy may relate to augmentation of anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) CD8(+) T-cell responses. We found that prolonged treatment of late-stage HIV-1-infected patients with a protease inhibitor and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors failed to restore sustained, high levels of HIV-1-specific, HLA class I-restricted, cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte precursors and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production by CD8(+) T cells. In some patients, particularly those initiating three-drug combination therapy simultaneously rather than sequentially, there were early, transient increases in the frequency of anti-HIV-1 CD8(+) T cells that correlated with decreases in HIV-1 RNA and increases in T-cell counts. In the other patients, HIV-1-specific T-cell functions either failed to increase or declined from baseline during triple-drug therapy, even though some of these patients showed suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA. These effects of combination therapy were not unique to HIV-1 specific T-cell responses, since similar effects were noted for CD8(+) T cells specific for the cytomegalovirus pp65 matrix protein. The level and breadth of CD8(+) cell reactivity to HLA A*02 HIV-1 epitopes, as determined by IFN-gamma production and HLA tetramer staining after combination therapy, were related to the corresponding responses prior to treatment. There was, however, a stable, residual population of potentially immunocompetent HIV-1-specific T cells remaining after therapy, as shown by tetramer staining of CD8(+) CD45RO(+) cells. These results indicate that new strategies will be needed to target residual, immunocompetent HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells to enhance the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in patients with advanced immunodeficiency."
Doc No.186,8354,negative/unlabeled,12.050332,ACOG Committee Opinion no 595: Committee on Gynecologic Practice: Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus.,"Preexposure prophylaxis is defined as the administration of antiretroviral medications to individuals who are not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and are at the highest risk of acquiring HIV infection. In combination with other proven HIV-prevention methods, preexposure prophylaxis may be a useful tool for women at the highest risk of HIV acquisition. Obstetrician-gynecologists involved in the care of women using preexposure prophylaxis must reinforce adherence to daily medication. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance for preexposure prophylaxis is likely to evolve in the coming years, and obstetrician-gynecologists should remain aware of new developments in this area. Risk reduction for all women at risk of HIV infection should include counseling about testing, safe-sex practices (including condom use), and other behavioral interventions."
Doc No.187,1636,positive/labeled,11.988488,Cytotoxic CD4 T cells in viral hepatitis.,"CD4+ T cells are thought to contribute to antiviral immune responses by secretion of cytokines thereby providing help to CD8+ T and B cells. However, perforin-positive cytotoxic CD4+ T cells have been described in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients suggesting a role not only of CD8+ but also of CD4+ T cells for killing virus-infected cells. We investigated 76 patients with viral hepatitis [15 hepatitis B virus (HBV), 22 HBV/hepatitis D virus and 17 hepatitis C virus (HCV)] for cytotoxic CD4+ T cells. The frequency of perforin-positive CD4+ T cells in viral hepatitis was highly variable ranging from < 1% to more than 25%. Perforin-positive CD4+ T cells displayed the phenotype of terminally differentiated effector cells (CD28-, CD27-). The highest frequencies of CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were found in patients with delta hepatitis (P = 0.04 vs HBV and HCV patients), and the presence of CD4+ CTLs was associated with elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels (P = 0.01) and decreased platelet counts (P = 0.03). Perforin-positive CD4+ T cells decreased in two individuals during spontaneous clearance of acute hepatitis C. Significant associations were found between the frequency of perforin-expressing CD4+ cells and age (P = 0.04), perforin-positive CD8+ cells (P < 0.001) and perforin-positive CD4-/CD8- lymphoid cells (P = 0.002). Differentiated CD27- effector CD4+ CTLs can be detected in patients with viral hepatitis. In particular in patients with more advanced liver disease, the accumulation of perforin-positive T cells with age could be one correlate for the more severe course of viral hepatitis in elderly individuals."
Doc No.188,8899,negative/unlabeled,11.986625,Adherence to nucleos(t)ide analogues for chronic hepatitis B in clinical practice and correlation with virological breakthroughs.,"Medication adherence is important for the success of nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC) treatment for chronic hepatitis B. The aims of this study were to determine adherence to NUCs and factors associated with NUC adherence and to correlate NUC adherence with the occurrence of virological breakthroughs in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving NUC were asked to complete a survey every 3 months. Adherence was also assessed by healthcare providers in the clinic. Adherence rate was defined as the per cent of days the patients took their hepatitis B virus medications during the last 30 days. A total of 111 patients were studied. The mean age was 47.7 years, 73.9% were men, 57.7% were Asian, 42.3% had postgraduate education and 80% had private insurance. Sixty-nine (74.1%) patients reported 100% adherence in the survey, while 78 (83.9%) reported 100% adherence to their healthcare providers. Patients with 100% adherence based on the survey were older (P = 0.02), more likely to be men (P = 0.006), and had higher annual household income (P = 0.04) than those with <100% adherence. In the 80 patients who completed three surveys, viral breakthrough was observed in 1/46 (2.2%) with 100% adherence on all three surveys, 1/18 (5.6%) with <100% adherence on one survey and 3/16 (18.8%) with <100% adherence on ≥2 surveys, (P = 0.06). In conclusion, adherence to NUC therapy in our patients with chronic hepatitis B was high but self-reporting of adherence to healthcare providers may be inflated. Patients with chronic hepatitis B with better adherence to NUC therapy had a trend towards a lower rate of viral breakthroughs."
Doc No.189,569,positive/labeled,11.98365,Highly active antiretroviral therapy restores CD4+ Vbeta T-cell repertoire in patients with primary acute HIV infection but not in treatment-naive HIV+ patients with severe chronic infection.,"In drug-naive HIV+ patients, we analyzed the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the reconstitution of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. We followed 2 groups of patients for 1 year: 18 individuals who experienced acute HIV infection and 24 patients who had HIV infection for many years but never took HAART. They were compared with 10 healthy controls who were longitudinally analyzed for the same period. We performed cytofluorometric analysis of the Vbeta TCR repertoire and detected the clonality of different Vbeta families by the spectratyping method. A new statistical approach based on the use of mixed models was then employed to analyze the data. Before the beginning of therapy, the repertoire of patients with acute or chronic infection was significantly different from that of healthy controls. After therapy, patients with acute HIV infection showed an improvement of the repertoire among either CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes. Conversely, patients with chronic infection were capable of changing their repertoire among CD8+ but not CD4+ T lymphocytes. Our results indicate that HAART can restore the T-cell repertoire in individuals whose immune system is not severely compromised by the infection."
Doc No.190,2021,positive/labeled,11.981147,Kinetics of the changes of lymphocyte subsets defined by cytokine production at single cell level during highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection.,"The effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy on cytokine imbalances associated with HIV-1 infection have not been characterized. Using single cell analysis by flow cytometry, we show that a significant recovery in the frequency of IL-2-producing cells was only observed in patients with a sustained control of viral replication and that the overexpanded CD8 T cell population of CD28- IFN-gamma + cells was not significantly reduced after 1 yr of effective therapy. Moreover, a detrimental role of IL-4 is suggested by the association between an enhanced proportion of IL-4-producing cells within the CD4 and particularly the CD8 subset and viral load rebound. Finally, the kinetics of changes of cell subsets assessed for simultaneous production of different cytokines supports the view that cell reconstitution during highly active antiretroviral therapy is initially due to redistribution of terminally differentiated cells, followed by peripheral expansion of less differentiated ones and a late progressive increase of the proportion of functionally defined naive/memory precursor lymphocytes. These data bring new support for the role of cytokine imbalances in AIDS pathogenesis and may be relevant for the definition of immunointervention targets."

The study, from April 2003 to May 2005, with follow-up through 24 mo, was conducted at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Second Xiangya Hospital, Central-South University in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. Twenty-seven HIV1-infected patients received didanosine, stavudine, and nevirapine. Information from case notes regarding age, sex, side effects, viral load, naive and memory T cells, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell count at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo was collected and analyzed. Virologic suppression, defined as an HIV RNA concentration of less than 50 copies/mL at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24, was considered the main outcome measure. Of 27 patients, 17 were men with a mean age 33.5 yr. The mean baseline viral load was 5.15 log copies/mL and the mean CD4(+) cell count was 185 cells/dL. Of 27 patients, 3 patients discontinued study medication; treatment was changed, because of side effects, from didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and nevirapine (NVP) to zidovudine, lamivudine, and NVP for 24 patients who had completed 24 mo of treatment with ddI, d4T, and NVP; and viral load suppression was attained in 17 patients (70.8%) at 12 mo, in 14 patients (58.3%) at 18 mo, and in 13 patients (56.6%) at 24 mo. The CD4 T cell count increased by 114 cells/microL (mean, 299 cells/microL) after 12 mo of treatment and by 132 cells/microL (mean, 317 cells/microL) after 24 mo of treatment. Naive T cells and memory cells also increased in number, but at a slower rate. Activated (CD38(+)) CD8(+) T cells were elevated at baseline (67.7%) and declined by month 24 (49.7%), but did not reach normal levels. We conclude that a regimen of NVP with ddI and d4T provided durable suppression of plasma viral load in HIV-infected patients, with significant improvement in the CD4 cell count, and can be well tolerated by patients with HIV-1 infection."
Doc No.192,4535,negative/unlabeled,11.955655,"Superior control of HIV-1 replication by CD8+ T cells is reflected by their avidity, polyfunctionality, and clonal turnover.","The key attributes of CD8+ T cell protective immunity in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remain unclear. We report that CD8+ T cell responses specific for Gag and, in particular, the immunodominant p24 epitope KK10 correlate with control of HIV-1 replication in human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 patients. To understand further the nature of CD8+ T cell-mediated antiviral efficacy, we performed a comprehensive study of CD8+ T cells specific for the HLA-B27-restricted epitope KK10 in chronic HIV-1 infection based on the use of multiparametric flow cytometry together with molecular clonotypic analysis and viral sequencing. We show that B27-KK10-specific CD8+ T cells are characterized by polyfunctional capabilities, increased clonal turnover, and superior functional avidity. Such attributes are interlinked and constitute the basis for effective control of HIV-1 replication. These data on the features of effective CD8+ T cells in HIV infection may aid in the development of successful T cell vaccines."

The goals of this paper are to guide the establishment and development of pharmacy services for patients infected with HCV and to highlight HCV research and educational opportunities. Recommendations were based on the following: a review of published data on clinical pharmacist involvement in the treatment and management of HCV-infected patients; a consensus of clinical pharmacists who provide direct patient care to HCV-infected patients and practice in different pharmacy models, including community-based and academic settings; and a review of published guidelines and literature focusing on the treatment and management of HCV infections. The recommendations provided in this opinion paper define the areas of clinical pharmacist involvement and clinical pharmacy practice in the treatment and management of patients with HCV. Clinical pharmacists can promote preventive measures and education about reducing HCV transmission, improve medication adherence, assist in monitoring clinical and adverse effects, recommend treatment strategies to minimize adverse effects and drug interactions, and facilitate medication acquisition and logistics that positively improve patient outcomes and reduce the health care system costs.

Parameters analysed were serum levels of the CD8+ T-cell-derived inhibitory molecules interleukin-16 (IL-16), monocyte inhibitory protein-1beta (MIP-1beta) and RANTES ('regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted'), and the enhancer of HIV replication, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). Twenty-five patients with chronic HIV infection were evaluated during three cycles of intermittent interruptions of therapy (8 weeks on/4 weeks off) in comparison with 20 healthy sex- and age-matched controls. At enrolment, HIV-infected patients showed significantly higher serum concentrations of IL-16 and RANTES, and significantly lower concentrations of MCP-1, than did healthy controls. Levels of MIP-1beta were similar in both groups. Only the serum levels of IL-16 increased significantly in HIV-infected patients after every treatment interruption. However, differences between the CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell counts/microL, HIV loads and serum concentrations of each cytokine at baseline and at the end of the three cycles of intermittent interruptions of therapy were not significant. It was concluded that structured intermittent interruption of HAART for patients with chronic HIV infection did not modify the immunological parameters, including serum levels of CD8+ T-cell-derived inhibitory molecules, or the virus parameters studied. Thus, the findings do not support the use of this treatment modality for the management of HIV-infected patients."
Doc No.195,5147,negative/unlabeled,11.943645,Developments of indoles as anti-HIV-1 inhibitors.,"Since the first case of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was reported in 1981, AIDS has always been a global health threat and the leading cause of deaths due to the rapid emergence of drug-resistance and unwanted metabolic side effects. Every day in 2007 an estimated 6850 people were newly infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Over the past 28 years the rapid worldwide spread of AIDS has prompted an intense research effort to discover compounds that could effectively inhibit HIV. The development of new, selective and safe inhibitors for the treatment of HIV, therefore, still remains a high priority for medical research. To the best of our knowledge, the indole derivatives have been considered as one class of promising HIV-1 inhibitors, such as delavirdine approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 for use in combination with other antiretrovirals in adults with HIV infection. In this review we focus on the synthesis and anti-HIV-1 activity of indole derivatives, in the meantime, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for some derivatives are also surveyed. It will pave the way for the design of indole derivatives as anti-HIV-1 drugs in the future."

Medicaid reimbursement criteria for sofosbuvir were evaluated in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The authors searched state Medicaid Web sites between 23 June and 7 December 2014 and extracted data in duplicate. Any differences were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted on whether sofosbuvir was covered and the criteria for coverage based on the following categories: liver disease stage, HIV co-infection, prescriber type, and drug or alcohol use. Of the 42 states with known Medicaid reimbursement criteria for sofosbuvir, 74% limit sofosbuvir access to persons with advanced fibrosis (Meta-Analysis of Histologic Data in Viral Hepatitis [METAVIR] fibrosis stage F3) or cirrhosis (F4). One quarter of states require persons co-infected with HCV and HIV to be receiving antiretroviral therapy or to have suppressed HIV RNA levels. Two thirds of states have restrictions based on prescriber type, and 88% include drug or alcohol use in their sofosbuvir eligibility criteria, with 50% requiring a period of abstinence and 64% requiring urine drug screening. Heterogeneity is present in Medicaid reimbursement criteria for sofosbuvir with respect to liver disease staging, HIV co-infection, prescriber type, and drug or alcohol use across the United States. Restrictions do not seem to conform with recommendations from professional organizations, such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Current restrictions seem to violate federal Medicaid law, which requires states to cover drugs consistent with their U.S. Food and Drug Administration labels."
Doc No.197,7648,negative/unlabeled,11.930403,Impact of HLA in mother and child on disease progression of pediatric human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.,"A broad Gag-specific CD8(+) T-cell response is associated with effective control of adult human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The association of certain HLA class I molecules, such as HLA-B*57, -B*5801, and -B*8101, with immune control is linked to mutations within Gag epitopes presented by these alleles that allow HIV to evade the immune response but that also reduce viral replicative capacity. Transmission of such viruses containing mutations within Gag epitopes results in lower viral loads in adult recipients. In this study of pediatric infection, we tested the hypothesis that children may tend to progress relatively slowly if either they themselves possess one of the protective HLA-B alleles or the mother possesses one of these alleles, thereby transmitting a low-fitness virus to the child. We analyzed HLA type, CD8(+) T-cell responses, and viral sequence changes for 61 mother-child pairs from Durban, South Africa, who were monitored from birth. Slow progression was significantly associated with the mother or child possessing one of the protective HLA-B alleles, and more significantly so when the protective allele was not shared by mother and child (P = 0.007). Slow progressors tended to make CD8(+) T-cell responses to Gag epitopes presented by the protective HLA-B alleles, in contrast to progressors expressing the same alleles (P = 0.07; Fisher's exact test). Mothers expressing the protective alleles were significantly more likely to transmit escape variants within the Gag epitopes presented by those alleles than mothers not expressing those alleles (75% versus 21%; P = 0.001). Reversion of transmitted escape mutations was observed in all slow-progressing children whose mothers possessed protective HLA-B alleles. These data show that HLA class I alleles influence disease progression in pediatric as well as adult infection, both as a result of the CD8(+) T-cell responses generated in the child and through the transmission of low-fitness viruses by the mother."
Doc No.198,4794,negative/unlabeled,11.92974,Factors related to virologic failure among HIV-positive injecting drug users treated with combination antiretroviral therapy including two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nevirapine.,"Treatment strategies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive active injecting drug users (IDUs) must take into account their lifestyles, that often result in low adherence to therapy. The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) offer simpler treatment regimens, but the appearance of drug resistance during treatment failure may cause high levels of cross-resistance to all NNRTIs. We adopted a combination therapy of two NRTIs and nevirapine (NVP) for treatment of IDU patients to evaluate its feasibility in such patients. From October 1998 to December 1999, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 80 IDUs on this regimen were collected. Fisher's exact test, Kaplan Meier method, and Cox model were used for statistical analysis. Overall, 20 IDUs discontinued the treatment because of side effects and 20 IDUs experienced treatment failure. Considering the treatment failure as an end point, 55.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.9%-72.6%) of patients was still undergoing treatment after 12 months compared to 44.6% (31.8%-58.6%) when discontinuation was also taken into account. An increasing trend over time was observed in the CD4+ lymphocyte count, among failing and nonfailing IDUs. By multivariate analysis, baseline HIV-RNA, treatment breaks and low adherence and active injecting drug use turned out to be significantly associated with treatment failure. Our results show that continuing injecting drug use and treatment breaks are the main factors that can lead to treatment failure in IDUs and easily to NNRTI class resistance."

However, the impact of this co-infection on the clinical outcome of HIV infection has not been elucidated. We herein demonstrate that the HBV X protein (HBx) superinduces ongoing HIV-1 replication and HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transcription by synergizing with Tat protein and with T-cell activation signals. Although HBx cooperated with mitogenic stimuli in the induction of reporter plasmids harboring the HIV-1 kappaB enhancer, in both a NF-kappaB-dependent manner and a NF-AT-dependent manner, deletion of this element from the LTR did not affect the HBx-mediated up-regulation in the presence of Tat and/or mitogens. In contrast, mutation of the proximal LTR Sp1-binding sites abolished the HBx-mediated synergistic activation, but only when it was accompanied by deletion of the kappaB enhancer. When HBx was targeted to the nucleus, its ability to synergize with cellular activation stimuli was maintained. Furthermore, mutations of HBx affecting its interaction with the basal transcription machinery abrogated the synergistic activation by HBx, suggesting that this protein exerts its function by acting as a nuclear co-activator. These results indicate that HBx could contribute to a faster progression to AIDS in HBV-HIV co-infected individuals."
Doc No.200,5566,negative/unlabeled,11.903992,An improvement in virologic response to highly active antiretroviral therapy in clinical practice from 1996 through 2002.,"Early studies of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use in clinical practice suggested suboptimal rates of viral suppression. HAART regimens and expertise in the use of HAART have since evolved, and we sought to determine how virologic response to HAART has changed in clinical practice. We compared all patients who started a first HAART regimen from 1996 through 2002 in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected patients in care in Baltimore. There were significant improvements in suppressing HIV RNA to < 400 copies/mL, ranging from 43.8% (1996) to 72.4% (2001-2002) by 6 months and from 60.1% (1996) to 79.9% (2001-2002) by 12 months (both P < 0.01 for trend). There were also significant improvements in CD4 cell response. Over time, there was a significant increase in the use of a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen compared with a single PI as well as an increase in the number of patients who were antiretroviral (ARV) naive. There was also a significant temporal trend from 1996 through 2002 in achieving a suppressed HIV RNA level, adjusting for being ARV naive, specific HAART regimen, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, and demographic factors. This suggests that improved virologic response may also be attributable to other factors such as a greater focus on medication adherence, improved ARV tolerability, and ease of dosing."
Doc No.201,2950,negative/unlabeled,11.889636,Impact of hepatitis C virus coinfection on immune restoration during successful antiretroviral therapy in chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 disease.,"The effect of coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) on immune restoration in 39 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients during treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) was prospectively evaluated. After 48 weeks of treatment, HCV-coinfected patients had lower increases in CD4% (P = .05), total CD4+ (P = .01), and naïve CD4+ (P = .06) T cells than did single-infected subjects. Higher baseline naïve CD4+ T-cell levels were associated with better CD4+ (P = .05) and naïve CD4+ (P < .001) T-cell recovery. After a 4-year follow up, the differences disappeared (median CD4+ increase: 291 and 306 cells for HCV-positive and HCV-negative patients, respectively, P = .9). No significant differences were seen in memory CD4+ T cells (P = .30), and CD8+ cells expressing CD38 (P = .10) and CD28 (P = .73). These results suggest that, independently of other factors, infection with HCV blunts early CD4+ T-cell recovery in HIV-infected patients treated with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, as good control of viral replication is maintained, satisfactory long-term immune restoration can nonetheless be achieved."
Doc No.202,3258,negative/unlabeled,11.825914,Association of hepatitis C virus-specific CD8+ T cells with viral clearance in acute hepatitis C.,"CD8+ T lymphocytes play a major role in antiviral immune defense. Their significance for acute hepatitis C is unclear. Our aim was to correlate the CD8+ T cell response with the outcome of infection. Eighteen patients with acute hepatitis C and 19 normal donors were studied. Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific CD8+ T cells were identified in the enzyme-linked immunospot assay by their interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production after specific stimulation. The highest numbers of IFN-gamma-producing HCV-specific CD8+ T cells were found in patients with acute hepatitis C and a self-limited course of disease during the first 6 months after onset of disease, but these numbers dropped thereafter to undetectable levels. The differences in responsiveness between patients with self-limited disease versus patients with a chronic course were statistically significant (P<.001). Our data show that the number of IFN-gamma-producing HCV-specific CD8+ T cells during the first 6 months after onset of disease is associated with eradication of the HCV infection."
Doc No.203,9951,negative/unlabeled,11.812618,A bereavement support group intervention is longitudinally associated with salutary effects on the CD4 cell count and number of physician visits.,"A randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted to examine the impact of a semistructured, 10-week, once weekly, 90-min/session bereavement support group intervention on immunological, neuroendocrine, and clinical health status in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-seropositive (HIV-1+) and HIV-1-seronegative (HIV-1-) homosexual men, compared to a standard of care control condition. A total of 119 homosexual men (74 HIV-1+ and 45 HIV-1-) were assessed at baseline, 10 weeks, and 6 months follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up assessment, the intervention groups exhibited significant beneficial effects compared to controls on changes in CD4 cell, total T-lymphocyte, and total lymphocyte counts, when baseline levels, antiretroviral medication use, CDC stage of disease, and other potentially confounding factors were accounted for. There was no statistically significant effect on the CD4/CD8 ratio or on the CD8 cell count. The effect on CD4 cell count was associated with group attendance and with changes in plasma cortisol level. Plasma cortisol levels decreased significantly among intervention subjects, compared to controls. A significantly reduced number of health care visits over the 6-month follow-up period among the intervention subjects supported the clinical relevance of the immunological changes observed for both HIV-1+ and HIV-1- individuals. These results indicate that behavioral interventions may have salutary immunological and clinical health effects following bereavement among HIV-1-infected individuals. The effect in HIV-1- individuals suggests that this bereavement support group intervention might have similar salutary effects in the general population. Potential effects of such interventions on clinical HIV disease progression are of interest and should be studied."
Doc No.204,8400,negative/unlabeled,11.796133,Evidence for CD8+ antiviral activity in cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes a long, asymptomatic infection characterized by normal to elevated numbers of circulating CD8+ cells and a progressive decline in CD4+ cells. It has been speculated that HIV-specific antiviral activity driven by CD8+ T cells may control viral replication during this period and maintain the clinically asymptomatic stage of disease. The disease induced in cats by feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is similar to HIV in that it is characterized by a long asymptomatic stage with a progressive decline in CD4+ cells, culminating in AIDS. In the present study, we demonstrate that FIV is more readily isolated from CD8+ T-cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of FIV-infected cats than from unfractionated PBMC cultures. In addition, CD8+ T cells isolated from FIV-positive cats demonstrating anti-FIV activity in PBMC cultures inhibit FIV infection of FCD4E cells in vitro. Anti-FIV activity is not found in FIV- negative cats and is not characteristic of cats acutely infected with FIV but is present in the majority of chronically infected, clinically asymptomatic and symptomatic cats. Decreases in plasma and cell-associated viremia during the acute-stage FIV infection appears to precede the appearance of CD8+ anti-FIV cells in the circulation. In summary, this study demonstrates a population(s) of CD8+ T cells in chronically FIV-infected cats capable of suppressing FIV replication in cultured PBMC. The significance of anti-FIV CD8+ cells in the immunopathogenesis of the infection and disease progression has yet to be determined."
Doc No.205,5415,negative/unlabeled,11.77281,Terminal differentiation of T cells is strongly associated with CMV infection and increased in HIV-positive individuals on ART and lifestyle matched controls.,"HIV-1-positive individuals on successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) are reported to have higher rates of age-associated non-communicable comorbidities (AANCCs). HIV-associated immune dysfunction has been suggested to contribute to increased AANCC risk. Here we performed a cross-sectional immune phenotype analysis of T cells in ART-treated HIV-1-positive individuals with undetectable vireamia (HIV-positives) and HIV-1-negative individuals (HIV-negatives) over 45 years of age. In addition, two control groups were studied: HIV negative adults selected based on lifestyle and demographic factors (Co-morBidity in Relation to AIDS, or COBRA) and unselected age-matched donors from a blood bank. Despite long-term ART (median of 12.2 years), HIV-infected adults had lower CD4+ T-cell counts and higher CD8+ T-cell counts compared to well-matched HIV-negative COBRA participants. The proportion of CD38+HLA-DR+ and PD-1+ CD4+ T-cells was higher in HIV-positive cohort compared to the two HIV-negative cohorts. The proportion CD57+ and CD27-CD28- cells of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in HIV-positives was higher compared to unselected adults (blood bank) as reported before but this difference was not apparent in comparison with well-matched HIV-negative COBRA participants. Multiple regression analysis showed that the presence of an increased proportion of terminally differentiated T cells was strongly associated with CMV infection. Compared to appropriately selected HIV-negative controls, HIV-positive individuals on ART with long-term suppressed viraemia exhibited incomplete immune recovery and increased immune activation/exhaustion. CMV infection rather than treated HIV infection appears to have more consistent effects on measures of terminal differentiation of T cells."
Doc No.206,4653,negative/unlabeled,11.77245,Anti-TAR polyamide nucleotide analog conjugated with a membrane-permeating peptide inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 production.,"The emergence of drug-resistant variants has posed a significant setback against effective antiviral treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The choice of a nonmutable region of the viral genome such as the conserved transactivation response element (TAR element) in the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) may potentially be an effective target for drug development. We have earlier demonstrated that a polyamide nucleotide analog (PNA) targeted to the TAR hairpin element, when transfected into cells, can effectively inhibit Tat-mediated transactivation of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) LTR (T. Mayhood et al., Biochemistry 39:11532-11539, 2000). Here we show that this anti-TAR PNA (PNA(TAR)), upon conjugation with a membrane-permeating peptide vector (transportan) retained its affinity for TAR in vitro similar to the unconjugated analog. The conjugate was efficiently internalized into the cells when added to the culture medium. Examination of the functional efficacy of the PNA(TAR)-transportan conjugate in cell culture using luciferase reporter gene constructs resulted in a significant inhibition of Tat-mediated transactivation of HIV-1 LTR. Furthermore, PNA(TAR)-transportan conjugate substantially inhibited HIV-1 production in chronically HIV-1-infected H9 cells. The mechanism of this inhibition appeared to be regulated at the level of transcription. These results demonstrate the efficacy of PNA(TAR)-transportan as a potential anti-HIV agent."
Doc No.207,9193,negative/unlabeled,11.76179,Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication with artificial transcription factors targeting the highly conserved primer-binding site.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) primer-binding site (PBS) is a highly conserved region in the HIV genome and represents an attractive target for the development of new anti-HIV therapies. In this study, we designed four artificial zinc finger transcription factors to bind at or adjacent to the PBS and repress transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). These proteins bound to the LTR in vivo, as demonstrated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In transient reporter assays, three of the four proteins repressed transcription of a reporter driven by the HIV-1 LTR. Only one of these proteins, however, designated KRAB-PBS2, was able to prevent virus production when transduced into primary lymphocytes. We observed >90% inhibition of viral replication over the course of several weeks compared to untransduced cells, and no significant cytotoxicity was observed. Long-term exposure of HIV-1 to KRAB-PBS2 induced mutations in the HIV-1 PBS that reduced the effectiveness of the repressor, but these mutations also resulted in decreased rates of viral replication. These results show that KRAB-PBS2 has the potential to be used in antiviral therapy for AIDS patients and might complement other gene-based strategies."
Doc No.208,9747,negative/unlabeled,11.733641,A systematic review of treatment fatigue among HIV-infected patients prescribed antiretroviral therapy.,"HIV treatment requires lifelong adherence to medication regimens that comprise inconvenient scheduling, adverse side effects, and lifestyle changes. Antiretroviral adherence and treatment fatigue have been inextricably linked. Adherence in HIV-infected populations has been well investigated; however, little is known about treatment fatigue. This review examines the current state of the literature on treatment fatigue among HIV populations and provides an overview of its etiology and potential consequences. Standard systematic research methods were used to gather published papers on treatment fatigue and HIV. Five databases were searched using PRISMA criteria. Of 1557 studies identified, 21 met the following inclusion criteria: (a) study participants were HIV-infected; (b) participants were prescribed antiretroviral medication; (c) the article referenced treatment fatigue; (d) the article was published in a peer-reviewed journal; and (e) text was available in English. Only seven articles operationally defined treatment fatigue, with three themes emerging throughout the definitions: (1) pill burden; (2) loss of desire to adhere to the regimen; and (3) nonadherence to regimens as a consequence of treatment fatigue. Based on these studies, treatment fatigue may be defined as ""decreased desire and motivation to maintain vigilance in adhering to a treatment regimen among patients prescribed long-term protocols."" The cause and course of treatment fatigue appear to vary by developmental stage. To date, only structured treatment interruptions have been examined as an intervention to reduce treatment fatigue in children and adults. No behavioral interventions have been developed to reduce treatment fatigue. Further, only qualitative studies have examined treatment fatigue conceptually. Studies designed to systematically assess treatment fatigue are needed. Increased understanding of the course and duration of treatment fatigue is expected to improve adherence interventions, thereby improving clinical outcomes for individuals living with HIV. "

Previous studies in wealthy nations have found that experiencing severe traumas can cause elevated levels of anxiety, but few studies have examined this association in non-disaster situations in less wealthy nations. Trauma and trauma-related anxiety are associated with greater sexual risk taking behaviours, lower HIV medication adherence levels and poorer health outcomes in wealthy nations. The objectives of this manuscript are: (1) to compare rates of trauma in two HIV-positive samples from areas that have not experienced disaster situations that are recognized by the international community as traumatic events; and (2) to examine whether the reported traumatic experiences are similarly associated with self-reported mental and physical health. The samples come from a region of a wealthy nation that consistently experiences large increases in incident AIDS cases and where the epidemic is largely transmitted heterosexually (Deep South, United States; n =611) and a region in a less wealthy nation with relatively high HIV prevalence and incidence rates and where transmission is also primarily heterosexual (Moshi, Tanzania; n =72). Compared to the US sample, the Tanzanian sample reported significantly higher rates of trauma in the areas of illness, injury, accidents and ""other"" significant traumas, a higher prevalence of anxiety and poorer physical health. The experience of trauma was similarly associated with greater mental health symptomatology and poorer physical health in both samples. Further investigation into the area of trauma and its sequelae is warranted, particularly in relation to risk behaviours and HIV medication adherence. At a time of increasing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in less wealthy nations, additional focus on trauma care could improve ART adherence rates and reduce risk behaviors, thereby assisting in stemming the further spread of the epidemic."

A systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis was conduct to evaluate how ARV adverse drug reactions may influence ARV adherence. Thirty-nine articles were identified, and 33 reported that ARV adverse drug reactions decreased adherence and six studies found no influence. Visually noticeable adverse drug reactions and psychological adverse reactions were reported as more likely to cause non-adherence compared to other adverse drug reactions. Six studies reported a range of adverse reactions associated with EFV-containing regimens contributing to decreased adherence. Informing HIV-infected individuals about ARV adverse drug reactions prior to initiation, counselling about coping mechanisms, and experiencing the effectiveness of ARVs on wellbeing may improve ARV adherence."
Doc No.211,5107,negative/unlabeled,11.57188,Epidemiology and clinical features of Cryptosporidium infection in immunocompromised patients.,"Cryptosporidium spp. are a major cause of diarrheal disease in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient individuals. They also cause waterborne disease in both the United States and United Kingdom. Studies on the mechanisms of immunity to cryptosporidiosis indicate the importance of the T-cell response. The spectrum and severity of disease in immunocompromised individuals with cryptosporidiosis reflect this importance since the most severe disease is seen in individuals with defects in the T-cell response. The most commonly studied group is that of patients with AIDS. These patients suffer from more severe and prolonged gastrointestinal disease that can be fatal; in addition, body systems other than the gastrointestinal tract may be affected. The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy does appear to be having a beneficial effect on recovery from cryptosporidiosis and on the frequency of infection in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients. Other diseases that are associated with increased risk of severe cryptosporidiosis, such as primary immunodeficiencies, most notably severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, are also predominantly associated with T-cell defects. Of the remaining groups, children with acute leukemia seem to be most at risk from cryptosporidiosis. There is less evidence of severe complications in patients with other malignant diseases or in those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy."

In one case, a 43-year-old female health-care worker required liver transplantation after developing fulminant hepatitis and end-stage hepatic failure while taking NVP, zidovudine, and lamivudine as PEP following a needlestick injury (1). In the second case, a 38-year-old male physician was hospitalized with life-threatening fulminant hepatitis while taking NVP, zidovudine, and lamivudine as PEP following a mucous membrane exposure. To characterize NVP-associated PEP toxicity, CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed MedWatch reports of serious adverse events in persons taking NVP for PEP received by FDA (Figure 1). This report summarizes the results of that analysis and indicates that healthy persons taking abbreviated 4-week NVP regimens for PEP are at risk for serious adverse events. Clinicians should use recommended PEP guidelines and dosing instructions to reduce the risk for serious adverse events."

A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of primary drug resistance (PDR) in a cohort of young (<25 yrs) HAART-naïve HIV pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe. Whole blood was collected in EDTA for CD4 counts, viral load, serological estimation of duration of infection using the BED Calypte assay and genotyping for drug resistance. Four hundred and seventy-one women, mean age 21 years; SD: 2.1 were enrolled into the study between 2006 and 2007. Their median CD4 count was 371cells/µL; IQR: 255-511 cells/µL. Two hundred and thirty-six samples were genotyped for drug resistance. Based on the BED assay, 27% were recently infected (RI) whilst 73% had long-term infection (LTI). Median CD4 count was higher (p<0.05) in RI than in women with LTI. Only 2 women had drug resistance mutations; protease I85V and reverse transcriptase Y181C. Prevalence of PDR in Chitungwiza, 4 years after commencement of the national ART program remained below WHO threshold limit (5%). Frequency of recent infection BED testing is consistent with high HIV acquisition during pregnancy. With the scale-up of long-term ART programs, maintenance of proper prescribing practices, continuous monitoring of patients and reinforcement of adherence may prevent the acquisition and transmission of PDR."

We investigated the recognition of HIV-1 protease by CD4+ T cells from 75 HIV-1-infected, protease inhibitor (PI)-treated patients, using the 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester-based proliferation assay. In order to identify putative promiscuous CD4+ T cell epitopes, we used the TEPITOPE algorithm to scan the sequence of the HXB2 HIV-1 protease. Protease regions 4-23, 45-64 and 73-95 were identified; 32 sequence variants of the mentioned regions, encoding frequent PI-induced mutations and polymorphisms, were also tested. On average, each peptide bound to five of 15 tested common human leucocyte antigen D-related (HLA-DR) molecules. More than 80% of the patients displayed CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cell recognition of at least one of the protease peptides. All 35 peptides were recognized. The response was not associated with particular HLA-DR or -DQ alleles. Our results thus indicate that protease is a frequent target of CD4+ along with CD8+ proliferative T cell responses by the majority of HIV-1-infected patients under PI therapy. The frequent finding of matching CD4(+) and CD8+ T cell responses to the same peptides may indicate that CD4+ T cells provide cognate T cell help for the maintenance of long-living protease-specific functional CD8+ T cells."
Doc No.215,8832,negative/unlabeled,11.512546,Timing of lymphocyte activation in neonates infected with human immunodeficiency virus.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in children is associated with qualitative and quantitative changes in the peripheral lymphocyte surface phenotype beyond the normal maturational changes. Neonates, however, have been reported to have a delayed immune response to HIV compared to HIV-infected adults. We prospectively performed immunophenotyping of T lymphocytes by three-color immunofluorescent labeling and laser flow cytometry to determine the timing of phenotypic alterations in 112 neonates born to HIV-infected mothers. Serial testing was performed at birth (cord blood) and at 2, 6, and 12 weeks of age. Data were divided retrospectively for analysis into those for HIV-infected (n = 14) infants and those for exposed, uninfected infants. Our results show that both infected and uninfected infants had a decline in the percentages and numbers of CD4 cells beginning at 2 weeks of age but that the decline was greater in the HIV-infected group. The activation and differentiation of CD8 T cells in HIV+ infants were shown by a significant increase in CD45RA- CD45RO+ CD8+ cells by 6 weeks of age and by increases in CD8+ S6F1+ CD3+ cells and HLA-DR+ CD38+ CD8+ cells by 2 weeks of age. These results indicate that HIV-infected neonates show alterations in T-cell phenotype reflecting those reported for older HIV-infected children. Most importantly, neonatal T cells are able to respond to HIV within the first weeks of life."

In this study, we evaluated the use of lipopeptide vaccine candidates containing HLA-A2-restricted epitopes for DC-based immunotherapy of HCV infection. Lipopeptides were able to induce specific CD8(+) T cell responses in HLA-A2 transgenic mice and consistently activated human monocyte-derived DC from both healthy individuals and HCV infected patients. Lipopeptide-pulsed human DC were also found to secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12p70 and were able to activate antigen-specific IFN-gamma production by autologous CD8(+) T cells obtained from a hepatitis C patient. These results show that DC from HCV patients can be matured and antigen loaded with TLR2-targeting lipopeptides for effective presentation of CD8(+) T cell epitopes; the use of autologous lipopeptide-pulsed DC or direct lipopeptide vaccination may be successful approaches for the priming or boosting of anti-HCV CD8(+) T cell responses to aid in the clearance of the virus in chronically infected individuals."
Doc No.217,9883,negative/unlabeled,11.488625,Hepatitis B virus surface (S) transactivator with DNA-binding properties.,"Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in humans is strongly linked to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Activation of growth-regulatory genes may play a crucial role in carcinogenesis. Proto-oncogene expression has been shown to be higher in HCC tissue with integrated HBV DNA than in the normal liver. Earlier, we showed that the 3' end of the HBV major surface gene (S) (426-855 nucleotides of the S region) is a transactivator of the X promoter-enhancer regulatory element in co-transfection experiments. This region expresses a truncated carboxy terminal S protein extending from amino acid residues 102 to 226. In this study, the truncated S protein (trc-S) was examined for its enhancing activity on several viral and cellular regulatory elements. The results indicate that trc-S activates rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (LTR), human T-lymphotropic virus 2 LTR, human immunodeficiency virus 1 LTR, and the c-jun and c-fos promoters. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays carried out to investigate its DNA-binding properties established that trc-S binds to HBV X promoter and oligonucleotides representing binding sites for the AP1 and TFIID transcription factors. The specificity of this interaction was confirmed by using competition experiments and supershift assays. These experiments suggest that trc-S is a transactivator of several cellular and viral promoters and that this activity is mediated by direct interaction with DNA."
Doc No.218,6955,negative/unlabeled,11.483817,Strategies for overcoming resistance in HIV-1 infected patients receiving HAART.,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has fundamentally changed the clinical outcome of HIV infection and AIDS. However, the emergence of drug-resistant HIV variants is a barrier to successful use of HAART, with resistance to one drug often resulting in cross-resistance to many, if not all, others in the same class. The rise in the incidence of drug-resistant variants among newly infected patients also represents a formidable challenge for clinicians. Failure of the current HAART regimen due to drug resistance can severely limit second-line, third-line, and salvage treatment options. Although inadequate exposure of the virus to antiretroviral agents is a prime reason for the emergence of HIV drug-resistant variants, poor adherence to complicated regimens and variability in drug pharmacokinetics (PK), both within and between HIV-infected individuals, can also affect the overall efficacy of antiretroviral agents, promoting emergence of resistant HIV variants. Recent strategies to optimize antiretroviral drug regimens, including assessment of HIV genotype and/or phenotype, the use of protease inhibitor regimens that incorporate PK boosting, and scheduled treatment interruptions, have been explored. Additionally, several newer antiretroviral agents that produce rapid and sustained virologic and immunologic responses as well as novel resistance profiles (e.g. atazanavir and tenofovir) have become available. These characteristics thus increase the likelihood of durable viral suppression."
Doc No.219,7661,negative/unlabeled,11.482866,Guidelines for using antiretroviral agents among HIV-infected adults and adolescents.,"The availability of an increasing number of antiretroviral agents and the rapid evolution of new information have introduced substantial complexity into treatment regimens for persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation convened the Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV to develop guidelines for clinical management of HIV-infected adults and adolescents (CDC. Report of the NIH Panel To Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection and Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected adults and adolescents. MMWR. 1998;47[RR-5]:1-41). This report, which updates the 1998 guidelines, addresses 1) using testing for plasma HIV ribonucleic acid levels (i.e., viral load) and CD4+ T cell count; 2) using testing for antiretroviral drug resistance; 3) considerations for when to initiate therapy; 4) adherence to antiretroviral therapy; 5) considerations for therapy among patients with advanced disease; 6) therapy-related adverse events; 7) interruption of therapy; 8) considerations for changing therapy and available therapeutic options; 9) treatment for acute HIV infection; 10) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among adolescents; 11) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among pregnant women; and 12) concerns related to transmission of HIV to others. Antiretroviral regimens are complex, have serious side effects, pose difficulty with adherence, and carry serious potential consequences from the development of viral resistance because of nonadherence to the drug regimen or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents. Patient education and involvement in therapeutic decisions are critical. Treatment should usually be offered to all patients with symptoms ascribed to HIV infection. Recommendations for offering antiretroviral therapy among asymptomatic patients require analysis of real and potential risks and benefits. In general, treatment should be offered to persons who have <350 CD4+ T cells/mm3 or plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels of >55,000 copies/mL (by b-deoxyribonucleic acid [bDNA] or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] assays). The recommendation to treat asymptomatic patients should be based on the willingness and readiness of the person to begin therapy; the degree of existing immunodeficiency as determined by the CD4+ T cell count; the risk for disease progression as determined by the CD4+ T cell count and level of plasma HIV RNA; the potential benefits and risks of initiating therapy in an asymptomatic person; and the likelihood, after counseling and education, of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. Treatment goals should be maximal and durable suppression of viral load, restoration and preservation of immunologic function, improvement of quality of life, and reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Results of therapy are evaluated through plasma HIV RNA levels, which are expected to indicate a 1.0 log10 decrease at 2-8 weeks and no detectable virus (<50 copies/mL) at 4-6 months after treatment initiation. Failure of therapy at 4-6 months might be ascribed to nonadherence, inadequate potency of drugs or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents, viral resistance, and other factors that are poorly understood. Patients whose therapy fails in spite of a high level of adherence to the regimen should have their regimen changed; this change should be guided by a thorough drug treatment history and the results of drug-resistance testing. Because of limitations in the available alternative antiretroviral regimens that have documented efficacy, optimal changes in therapy might be difficult to achieve for patients in whom the preferred regimen has failed. These decisions are further confounded by problems with adherence, toxicity, and resistance. For certain patients, participating in a clinical trial with or without access to new drugs or using a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replicatioing a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replication might be preferable. Because concepts regarding HIV management are evolving rapidly, readers should check regularly for additional information and updates at the HIV/AIDS Treatment Information Service website ( http://www.hivatis.org )."

We have examined 10 chronically infected HIV-1-positive chimpanzees for evidence of progressive infection. In addition to 1 animal that developed AIDS, 3 chimpanzees exhibit evidence of progressive HIV infection. All progressors have low CD4(+) T cell counts (<200 cells/microL), severe CD4:CD8 inversion, and marked reduction in interleukin-2 receptor expression by CD4(+) T cells. In comparison with HIV-positive nonprogressor chimpanzees, progressors have higher plasma and lymphoid virus loads, greater CD38 expression in CD8(+)/HLA-DR(+) T cells, and greater serum concentrations of soluble tumor necrosis factor type II receptors and beta2-microglobulin, all markers of HIV progression in humans. These observations show that progressive HIV-1 infection can occur in chimpanzees and suggest that the pathogenesis of progressive infection in this species resembles that in humans."
Doc No.221,1914,negative/unlabeled,11.448911,Prolonged survival and tissue trafficking following adoptive transfer of CD4zeta gene-modified autologous CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects.,"We have genetically engineered CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) specificity by inserting a gene, CD4zeta, containing the extracellular domain of human CD4 (which binds HIV env) linked to the zeta (zeta) chain of the T-cell receptor (which mediates T-cell activation). Twenty-four HIV-positive subjects received a single infusion of 2 to 3 x 10(10) autologous CD4zeta-modified CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells administered with (n = 11) or without (n = 13) interleukin-2 (IL-2). Subjects had CD4 counts greater than 50/microL and viral loads of at least 1000 copies/mL at entry. T cells were costimulated ex vivo through CD3 and CD28 and expanded for approximately 2 weeks. CD4zeta was detected in 1% to 3% of blood mononuclear cells at 8 weeks and 0.1% at 1 year after infusion, and survival was not enhanced by IL-2. Trafficking of gene-modified T cells to bulk rectal tissue and/or isolated lamina propria lymphocytes was documented in a subset of 5 of 5 patients at 14 days and 2 of 3 at 1 year. A greater than 0.5 log mean decrease in rectal tissue-associated HIV RNA was observed for at least 14 days, suggesting compartmental antiviral activity of CD4zeta T cells. CD4(+) counts increased by 73/microL at 8 weeks in the group receiving IL-2. There was no significant mean change in plasma HIV RNA or blood proviral DNA in either treatment arm. This sustained, high-level persistence of gene-modified T cells demonstrates the feasibility of ex vivo T-cell gene therapy in HIV-infected adults and suggests the importance of providing HIV-specific T-helper function."
Doc No.222,2200,negative/unlabeled,11.438353,Reaction time variability in HIV-positive individuals.,"Progression of HIV/AIDS is frequently associated with frontal/subcortical dysfunction and mean reaction time (RT) slowing. Beyond group means, within-subject variability of RT has been found to be particularly sensitive to frontal/subcortical dysfunction in other populations. However, the possible relevance of RT variability to HIV/AIDS patients remains unknown. This study evaluated the relationships between RT variability and indicators such as neurocognitive, behavioral, and immunological status. A total of 46 HIV-positive adults on antiretroviral medication regimens were included in this study. Overall performance of this sample was poorer than normative means on measures of RT latency, RT variability, and traditional neurocognitive domains. Results demonstrated that the measures of RT variability were associated with global cognition, medication adherence rates, and peak immunological dysfunction, above and beyond the effects of RT latency. These preliminary findings suggest that measures of RT variability may provide enhanced sensitivity to neurocognitive disease burden in HIV/AIDS relative to more traditional measures of mean RT or cognitive function."

The Berlin Diarrhoea/Wasting Syndrome Study Group.","Intestinal T cells have a unique state of activation and differentiation which might specifically affect or be affected by HIV infection. Lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood are well characterized, but our knowledge about intestinal lymphocytes in HIV infection is incomplete. We therefore analysed lymphocytes isolated from large intestine biopsies of AIDS patients and controls by three-colour cytofluorometry. In the large intestine of HIV-infected patients CD4 T cells were reduced and CD8 T cells were increased compared with controls. Most of the CD8 T cells in the colorectal mucosa of AIDS patients were of the cytotoxic phenotype. Activated and resting CD4 T cells were similarly reduced, the expression of CD25 and HLA-DR of CD8 T cells was unaltered and increased, respectively. In intestinal CD4 T cells the expression of CD29 was decreased, but the expression of CD45RO and HML-1 was normal. CD8 T cells had a decreased expression of all these differentiation markers. Our findings demonstrate substantial alterations in subset distribution, activation, and differentiation of large intestine T cells, which may contribute to the secondary infections and malignancies commonly observed in the gut of AIDS patients."
Doc No.224,3382,negative/unlabeled,11.424091,Activation of the HIV-1 LTR by T cell mitogens and the trans-activator protein of HTLV-I.,"To investigate the mechanism by which immune activation augments replication of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in infected T cells, four different classes of T cell mitogens were evaluated for their effects on the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a mitogenic lectin; phorbol 12-myristic 13-acetate, a tumor promoter; ionomycin, a calcium ionophore; and tat-1, the trans-activator protein from the human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) each stimulated the HIV-1 LTR. Studies of deleted forms of the LTR supported a central role in these responses for the HIV-1 enhancer, which alone was sufficient for mitogen inducibility, but also suggested that other 5' positive and negative regulatory elements contribute to the overall magnitude of the response. Synergistic activation of the HIV-1 LTR (up to several thousandfold) was observed with combinations of these mitogens and the HIV-1--derived tat-III protein. Cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive agent, inhibited PHA-mediated activation of the HIV-1 LTR but was without effect in the presence of other mitogens. Thus, HIV-1 gene expression and replication appear to be regulated, via the HIV-1 LTR, by the same mitogenic signals that induce T cell activation."
Doc No.225,1691,negative/unlabeled,11.415876,"Association between enteric protozoan parasites and gastrointestinal illness among HIV- and tuberculosis-infected individuals in the Chowke district, southern Mozambique.","Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) infections remain major public health issues globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Impairment of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity by HIV and/or TB infections may limit the host's defences against other pathogens, including the diarrheagenic protozoan Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia intestinalis, and Entamoeba histolytica. During September-December 2015 a cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence and molecular diversity of these enteric parasites among HIV- and/or TB-infected patients at a medical reference centre in Chowke district, southern Mozambique. A total of 99 stool specimens were initially screened by direct microscopy and further confirmed and characterised by molecular methods. DNA sequence analyses of the genes encoding the small subunit ribosomal RNA and the 60-kDa glycoprotein were used for the typing and sub-typing of Cryptosporidium isolates, respectively. G. intestinalis-positive isolates by real-time PCR were subsequently typed at the glutamate dehydrogenase locus. Differential diagnosis of E. histolytica/dispar was achieved by real-time PCR. G. intestinalis (8.1%) was the enteric protozoan more frequently detected, followed by Cryptosporidium spp. (7.1%), and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (6.1%). Two HIV-infected (but not TB-infected) patients harbour G. intestinalis and Cryptosporidium spp. co-infections. Two (29%) G. intestinalis isolates were successfully characterised, revealing the presence of known AII and novel BIV genotypes. Four (57%) Cryptosporidium isolates were unmistakeable assigned to C. hominis, identifying two (IbA10G2 and IdA22) sub-types. Cryptosporidium infections were not associated to diarrhoea in HIV-positive patients, probably because improved immune function in the affected individuals due to antiretroviral therapy. G. intestinalis was considered a non-opportunistic pathogen, whereas the presence of E. histolytica could not be confirmed by molecular methods. Based on their common presence in the studied clinical population, we recommend the effective diagnosis and treatment of these enteropathogens for improving the management of HIV and TB patients."
Doc No.226,7080,negative/unlabeled,11.411099,Iron-deficiency anemia and the cycle of poverty among human immunodeficiency virus-infected women in the inner city.,"The prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia appears to be extremely high among female injection drug users in the inner city who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or hepatitis C (HCV) infections. Iron deficiency and its associated anemia may contribute to reduced energetic efficiency, lower aerobic capacity, decreased endurance, and fatigue. In practical terms, the functional limitations of iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia may affect the ability of women to participate in work, school, social, and family activities. Iron deficiency may contribute to the cycle of poverty in the inner city by limiting the ability of women to work, earn money, and afford iron-rich sources of food. Although iron supplementation may prevent or treat iron deficiency, the use of iron supplements needs to be approached with caution in women with HIV and HCV infections."
Doc No.227,4023,negative/unlabeled,11.393252,Impact of drug resistance genotypes on CD4+ counts and plasma viremia in heavily antiretroviral-experienced HIV-infected patients.,"The number of HIV-infected individuals with prior multiple treatment failures is increasing as time passes by. The success of antiretroviral therapy in these patients is often compromised by the selection of drug-resistant viruses. Despite initial concerns, a rebound in AIDS cases among heavily treatment-experienced patients failing virologically their antiretroviral therapy has not occurred yet. In a multicenter study conducted in Spain, HIV-infected patients were assessed with prior failure to antiretrovirals from the three main drug families who presented during the last semester of the year 2003 with plasma HIV-RNA values above 1,000 copies/ml, despite good treatment adherence. The relationships between CD4+ T cell counts, viral loads and drug-resistant genotypes were examined. A total of 273 patients were identified in 12 centers (78% male, median age: 41 years). The mean viral load was 50,438 copies/ml and the mean CD4+ count was 328 cells/mul. Only 19.5% had less than 200 CD4+ T cells/mul. Most patients (95%) were receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) in their last antiretroviral regimen, while 63% were treated with protease inhibitors (PI) and 27% on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Overall, 97.4% had at least one drug resistance mutation (87.2% for NRTI, 68.5% for NNRTI, and 92.7% for PI). Using the virtual phenotype, resistance to three or more drugs within each class was recognized in 45.8% for NRTI, 40.7% for NNRTI, and 44.7% for PI. Moreover, cross-resistance to compounds from two or three drug families was recognized in 41% and 19.4% of patients, respectively. Nearly half of the patients had plasma HIV-RNA below 10,000 copies/ml and they showed significantly higher CD4 + counts than those with greater viremia (408 versus 259 cells/mul; P < 0.001). Patients with higher plasma viremia had significantly more drug resistance mutations than those with lower viremia. No favorable effect on viral load could be recognized for individual drug resistance mutations known to reduce viral fitness in vitro (i.e., rtM184V, rtL74V, rtK65R, proD30N, or proI50L). In summary, a large proportion of treatment-experienced patients failing their current antiretroviral regimen carry viruses with broad cross-resistant genotypes. Nearly half of the patients with these multi-drug resistant viruses had < 10,000 HIV-RNA copies/ml and 80% have more than 200 CD4 + T cells/mul. Thus, maintaining treatment HIV-infected individuals failing virologically and harboring drug-resistant viruses might ameliorate immunological deterioration until new drugs became available. J. Med.

Doc No.228,8321,negative/unlabeled,11.383673,Major depression in patients with HIV/AIDS and substance abuse.,"Previous research has been inconsistent in documenting a strong relationship between depression and HIV/AIDS, although a recent meta-analysis of studies examining this issue indicates that rates of depression are modestly higher for this population. For the current study, conducted from 2001-2004, we sought to examine rates and types of depressive symptoms in a cohort of patients receiving HIV care at two urban medical centers. These patients were participants in an intervention study examining adherence and mental health in persons triply diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders, and HIV/AIDS. Nearly three quarters of these participants were people of color, two thirds described their sexual orientation as heterosexual, and the vast majority were unemployed. We sought to examine the relationship of depression to patients' adherence to antiretroviral medication regimens (highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]). Results obtained from structured clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires indicated that study participants experienced high rates of depressive symptoms, and that 72.9% of participants met criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). The results of this study offer a detailed view of the incidence and nature of MDDs and depressive symptoms for an urban sample of substance-abusing adults with HIV/AIDS. Given the degree to which depressive symptoms and MDD appear to be prevalent for this group, as well as the observation that these symptoms are amenable to treatment, future research should focus on identifying helpful strategies and interventions for treating these symptoms, effective ways of providing linkages to care, and ways in which standardized assessment and treatment protocols might be adapted to better suit this population."
Doc No.229,276,negative/unlabeled,11.377321,Neopterin estimation compared with the ratio of T-cell subpopulations in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1.,"We measured neopterin, a biochemical indicator for the activation of cell-mediated immune reactions, in urines from 105 individuals at risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), 83 of whom were seropositive for antibody to HIV-1. We compared absolute numbers of T-cell subsets (CD4+ helper/inducer T-cells, CD8+ suppressor/cytotoxic T-cells), and the ratio of CD4+ T-cells to CD8+ T-cells with the urinary neopterin concentrations. Concentrations of neopterin in urine were inversely correlated with absolute numbers of CD4+ T-cells and with CD4+/CD8+ ratios in anti-HIV-1 seropositive subjects but not in those seronegative. Various statistical comparisons of the data further demonstrated that neopterin concentrations showed larger differences between anti-HIV-1 seronegative and seropositive subjects than absolute numbers of CD4+ T-cells or CD4+/CD8+ ratios. These results seem to indicate that neopterin concentrations increase earlier in the course of HIV-1 infection, before effects on T-cell subpopulations are detectable, and may further support the suggestion that neopterin measurement could be of use for monitoring infected subjects or predicting the progression of disease."
Doc No.230,5344,negative/unlabeled,11.352786,HIV-1 compartmentalization in diverse leukocyte populations during antiretroviral therapy.,"CD4+ T lymphocytes are the primary target of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but there is increasing evidence that other immune cells in the blood, including CD8+ T lymphocytes and monocytes, are also productively infected. The extent to which these additional cellular reservoirs contribute to ongoing immunodeficiency and viral persistence during therapy remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a detailed investigation of HIV-1 diversity and genetic structure in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and monocytes of 13 patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Analysis of molecular variance and nonparametric tests performed on HIV-1 envelope sequences provided statistically significant evidence of viral compartmentalization in different leukocyte populations. Signature pattern analysis and predictions of coreceptor use provided no evidence that selection arising from viral tropism was responsible for the genetic structure observed. Analysis of viral genetic variation in different leukocyte populations demonstrated the action of founder effects as well as significant variation in the extent of genetic differentiation between subpopulations among patients. In the absence of evidence for leukocyte-specific selection, these features were supportive of a metapopulation model of HIV-1 replication as described previously among HIV-1 populations in the spleen. Compartmentalization of the virus in different leukocytes may have significant implications for current models of HIV-1 population genetics and contribute to the highly variable way in which drug resistance evolves in different individuals during HAART."
Doc No.231,6102,negative/unlabeled,11.348295,Immune activation and CD8+ T-cell differentiation towards senescence in HIV-1 infection.,"Progress in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic is hindered by our failure to elucidate the precise reasons for the onset of immunodeficiency in HIV-1 infection. Increasing evidence suggests that elevated immune activation is associated with poor outcome in HIV-1 pathogenesis. However, the basis of this association remains unclear. Through ex vivo analysis of virus-specific CD8(+) T-cells and the use of an in vitro model of naïve CD8(+) T-cell priming, we show that the activation level and the differentiation state of T-cells are closely related. Acute HIV-1 infection induces massive activation of CD8(+) T-cells, affecting many cell populations, not only those specific for HIV-1, which results in further differentiation of these cells. HIV disease progression correlates with increased proportions of highly differentiated CD8(+) T-cells, which exhibit characteristics of replicative senescence and probably indicate a decline in T-cell competence of the infected person. The differentiation of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cells towards a state of replicative senescence is a natural process. It can be driven by excessive levels of immune stimulation. This may be part of the mechanism through which HIV-1-mediated immune activation exhausts the capacity of the immune system."

In particular, molecules of the B7:CD28 family play a critical role in regulating T cell activation and peripheral tolerance. Chronic pathogens like HIV, which is characterized by ongoing viral replication despite detectable virus-specific T cell responses, and cancer cells have exploited these pathways to attenuate Ag-specific T cell immunity. This review summarizes evidence that molecules of the B7:CD28 family, PD-1, CTLA-4, and their ligands, play an active and reversible role in virus-specific T cell exhaustion associated with HIV infection in humans and in the SIV model in macaques. We discuss the potential for immunotherapeutic interventions based on manipulation of these inhibitory networks, the promising data obtained with blockade of the PD-1 pathway in animal models, and the challenges to such therapies."

Prisoners were randomized to receive ART by DOT or SAT. The primary outcome was medication adherence [percent of ART doses measured by the medication event monitoring system (MEMS) and pill counts] at the end of 24 weeks. The changes in the plasma viral loads from baseline and proportion of participants virological suppressed (<400 copies/mL) at the end of 24 weeks were assessed. Sixty-six percent (90/136) of eligible prisoners declined participation. Participants in the DOT arm (n = 20) had higher viral loads than participants in the SAT (n = 23) arm (p = 0.23). Participants, with complete data at 24 weeks, were analyzed as randomized. There were no significant differences in median ART adherence between the DOT (n = 16, 99% MEMS [IQR 93.9, 100], 97.1 % pill count [IQR 95.1, 99.3]) and SAT (n = 21, 98.3 % MEMS [IQR 96.0, 100], 98.5 % pill count [95.8, 100]) arms (p = 0.82 MEMS, p = 0.40 Pill Count) at 24 weeks. Participants in the DOT arm had a greater reduction in viral load of approximately -1 log 10 copies/mL [IQR -1.75, -0.05] compared to -0.05 [IQR -0.45, 0.51] in the SAT arm (p value = 0.02) at 24 weeks. The proportion of participants achieving virological suppression in the DOT vs SAT arms was not statistically different at 24 weeks (53 % vs 32 %, p = 0.21). These findings suggest that DOT ART programs in prison settings may not offer any additional benefit on adherence than SAT programs."

The recipients were classified into the following groups according to a hierarchical clustering of their preoperative CD8CD45 T-cell isoforms: group I, naive-dominant; group II, effector memory-dominant; and group III, effector-dominant. Plasma HCV-RNA rapidly increased and then peaked as an initial burst around postoperative day (POD) 25 in group I, on POD 40 in group II, and on POD 55 in group III. The initial burst of viremia was suppressed by the high expression of CD8+CD28-CD27- subsets. The progression of fibrosis > or =F2 was significantly more frequent for those patients with the highest viremia levels. Moreover, the initial T-cell immune response became less important throughout time, and new immune responses emerged after 2 months that modified the host-virus interaction. It is suggested that the interferon (IFN)-alpha/ribavirin therapy starting 2 months may be an effective option and now is undertaken."

However, sub-optimal adherence occurs in a sizable proportion of patients, and is independently predictive of detectable viremia. We investigated sub-optimal adherence according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill assessment methods, and their associated factors among HIV-infected adults receiving cART in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Eight-hundred seventy patients who initiated cART between May 2009 and April 2012 were randomly selected, and 664 patients who were alive, had remained in clinical care and were receiving cART for at least six-months were included. Sub-optimal adherence was defined as patients' response of less than ""all-of the time"" to the self-report adherence question, or any clinician-recorded poor adherence during the six most recent clinic visits, or a pharmacy-refill of <95% medication possession ratio (MPR). Logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with sub-optimal adherence. The average adherence level to cART, expressed as MPR, was nearly 97%. However, sub-optimal adherence occurred in 12%, 4%, and 27% of patients according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill measures, respectively. More satisfaction with social support was significantly associated with less sub-optimal adherence according to self-report and clinician-record. Younger age, lower educational level, and lower CD4 cell count at cART initiation were significantly associated with sub-optimal refill-based adherence. Findings from our large multi-center study suggest that sub-optimal adherence was present in up to a quarter of the patients, despite a high degree of average adherence to cART. Interventions aimed at preventing sub-optimal adherence should focus on improving social support, on younger patients, on patients with lower educational level, and on those who started cART at a lower CD4 cell count."

We tested the effects of HLA-DP SNPs for all major HBV outcomes in Han Chinese (n = 1742): HBV resistance, clearance, chronic infection, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HLA - DPA1 rs3077 T was strongly associated with decreased risk of chronic HBV infection (odds ratio, .62; P = .001), consistent with the previous report.

A cohort with 2372 PLWH was enrolled between July 2007 and June 2010 and monitored until 31 December 2012 at two healthcare centres. The event of interest was immunodeficiency-related death, which was defined based on the Coding Causes of Death in HIV Protocol (CoDe). The predictor variables were: sociodemographic characteristics, illicit drugs, tobacco, alcohol, nutritional status, antiretroviral therapy, anaemia and CD4 cell count at baseline; and treatment or chemoprophylaxis for tuberculosis (TB) during follow-up. We used Fine & Gray's model for the survival analyses with competing risks, since we had regarded immunodeficiency-unrelated deaths as a competing event, and we estimated the adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratios (SHRs). In 10 012·6 person-years of observation there were 3·1 deaths/100 person-years (2·3 immunodeficiency-related and 0·8 immunodeficiency-unrelated). TB (SHR 4·01), anaemia (SHR 3·58), CD4 <200 cells/mm3 (SHR 3·33) and being unemployed (SHR 1·56) were risk factors for immunodeficiency-related death. This study discloses a 13% coverage by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in our state and adds that anaemia at baseline or the incidence of TB may increase the specific risk of dying from HIV-immunodeficiency, regardless of HAART and CD4."

While the interaction of X4 HIV-1 with CXCR4 does not seem to activate this pathway, viruses using CCR5 for entry efficiently activate MEK/ERK kinases (W. Popik, J. E. Hesselgesser, and P. M. Pitha, J. Virol. 72:6406-6413, 1998; W. Popik and P. M. Pitha, Virology 252:210-217, 1998). Since the importance of MEK/ERK in the initial steps of viral replication is poorly understood, we have examined the role of MEK/ERK signaling in the CD3- and CD28 (CD3/CD28)-mediated activation of HIV-1 replication in resting peripheral blood CD4(+) T lymphocytes infected with X4 or R5 HIV-1. We have found that the MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 selectively inhibited CD3/CD28-stimulated replication of X4 HIV-1, while it did not affect the replication of R5 HIV-1. Inhibition of the CD3/CD28-stimulated MEK/ERK pathway did not affect the formation of the early proviral transcripts in cells infected with either X4 or R5 HIV-1, indicating that virus reverse transcription is not affected in the absence of MEK/ERK signaling. In contrast, the levels of nuclear provirus in cells infected with X4 HIV-1, detected by the formation of circular proviral DNA, was significantly lower in cells stimulated in the presence of MEK/ERK inhibitor than in the absence of the inhibitor. However, in cells infected with R5 HIV-1, the inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway did not affect nuclear localization of the proviral DNA. These data suggest that the nuclear import of X4, but not R5, HIV-1 is dependent on a CD3/CD28-stimulated MEK/ERK pathway."

Nevertheless, the comparable proviral DNA burdens observed for these two infections indicate similar numbers of infected cells. Here we investigated this apparent paradox by assessing cell-associated viral replication. We found that untreated HIV-1-positive (HIV-1(+)) and HIV-2(+) individuals, matched for CD4 T cell depletion, exhibited similar gag mRNA levels, indicating that significant viral transcription is occurring in untreated HIV-2(+) patients, despite the reduced viremia (undetectable to 2.6 × 10(4) RNA copies/ml). However, tat mRNA transcripts were observed at significantly lower levels in HIV-2(+) patients, suggesting that the rate of de novo infection is decreased in these patients. Our data also reveal a direct relationship of gag and tat transcripts with CD4 and CD8 T cell activation, respectively. Antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated HIV-2(+) patients showed persistent viral replication, irrespective of plasma viremia, possibly contributing to the emergence of drug resistance mutations, persistent hyperimmune activation, and poor CD4 T cell recovery that we observed with these individuals. In conclusion, we provide here evidence of significant ongoing viral replication in HIV-2(+) patients, further emphasizing the dichotomy between amount of plasma virus and cell-associated viral burden and stressing the need for antiretroviral trials and the definition of therapeutic guidelines for HIV-2 infection."

CD4+ counts are known to be inherently inconsistent and therefore could be misleading. This study was undertaken to analyze the CD4+/CD8+ ratio vis-à-vis CD4+ in HIV-1 infected individual in North Central Nigeria and to correlate these immunological parameters to AIDS event and death in relation to gender and age of patients. Cell counts were carried out using a Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) that quantifies CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes as absolute numbers of lymphocytes per microL of blood and the CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio recorded in an automated fashion. A total of 290 HIV-1 positive persons were enrolled for this study. The median CD4+/CD8+ ratio were 0.05, 0.27, 0.64 in patients with CD4+ counts of < 50, 51-200, > 350 respectively. CD4+/ CD8+ of 0.05 and 0.27 were corresponding predictors of AIDS-related event and death. Patients with > 0.64 are predictive of better disease prognosis and low progression to AIDS. The CD4+/CD8+ were minimally higher in female patients with a median CD4+/CD8 ratio of 0.27. The age distribution of our patients at point of first entry was not found to influence CD4+/CD8+ ratios. These findings provide basic and critical CD4+/CD8+ cut-off values in predicting HIV disease progression and an alternative to absolute CD4+ counts at predicting the onset of HIV related disease. These data are useful to determine when intervention with antiretroviral therapy is needed and to determine the likelihood of virological failure."

This study compares the efficacy of a personalized cell phone reminder system (ARemind) in enhancing adherence to ART versus a beeper. Twenty-three HIV-infected subjects on ART with self-reported adherence less than 85% were randomized to a cellular phone (CP) or beeper (BP). CP subjects received personalized text messages daily; in contrast, BP subjects received a reminder beep at the time of dosing. Interviews were scheduled at weeks 3 and 6. Adherence to ART was measured by self-report (SR, 7-day recall), pill count (PC, past 30 days at baseline, then past 3 weeks), Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS; cumulatively at 3 and 6 weeks), and via a composite adherence score constructed by combining MEMS, pill count, and self report. A mixed effects model adjusting for baseline adherence was used to compare adherence rates between the intervention groups at 3 and 6 weeks. Nineteen subjects completed all visits, 10 men and 9 females. The mean age was 42.7 ± 6.5 years, 37% of subjects were Caucasian and 89% acquired HIV heterosexually. The average adherence to ART was 79% by SR and 65% by PC at baseline in both arms; over 6 weeks adherence increased and remained significantly higher in the ARemind group using multiple measures of adherence. A larger and longer prospective study is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand optimal reminder messages and user fatigue."

We evaluated differences in past dietary glycemic intake between men with HIV who developed fat deposition and those who did not. This was a nested case-control study consisting of 37 cases and 37 controls from the Nutrition for Healthy Living cohort. Food records from 6 to 24 months prior to development of fat deposition in cases were analyzed and compared with controls. Cases were defined as men with a waist-to-hip ratio >0.95 and body mass index (calculated as kg/m(2)) between 23 and 26. Controls were matched by age, race, body mass index, highly active antiretroviral therapy use, and CD4 count. Food records were analyzed using t tests for normally distributed nutrients and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for nutrients with skewed distributions. Glycemic index was calculated for each meal and day. There was no significant difference in glycemic index for meals and day between participants with or without fat deposition. Both groups had a moderate dietary glycemic index intake. This study showed no association between dietary glycemic index and development of fat deposition in HIV. Instead, results of this study depict the potential benefits associated with eating high-quality diets, primarily adequate fiber and protein intake. Diet can be important in preventing development of fat deposition in patients with HIV."

Factors related to symptomatic infection and survival.,"The authors reviewed the medical records of 194 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients newly diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis and all 3,564 patients with newly diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at San Francisco General Hospital for the period 1986-1992. The study was designed to address three questions: 1) How do AIDS patients who present with cryptosporidiosis differ from other patients with AIDS? 2) What factors are associated with survival among AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis? 3) Does a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis impact survival after AIDS diagnosis? A total of 194 cases of cryptosporidiosis among HIV-infected patients were identified during the study period. Of the 194 patients, 109 (56%) had no prior diagnosis of AIDS. These 109 patients represented 3.1% of the 3,564 newly diagnosed cases of AIDS in the same period. Among the 134 patients with CD4 T-lymphocyte counts performed within 3 months of Cryptosporidium diagnosis, 34 (25%) had CD4 counts greater than 209 cells/ml. In a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the incidence of Cryptosporidium was related to ethnicity (for blacks vs. whites, matched odds ratio (OR) = 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.73), CD4 count (for a CD4 count of < or = 53 cells/ml vs. > 53 cells/ml, matched OR = 12.60, 95% CI 4.01-39.61), and age (for a 10-year increase, matched OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.98). Two factors measured at the time of Cryptosporidium diagnosis were identified as being independently associated with survival (p < 0.001) in the proportional hazards model: CD4 count < or = 53 cells/ml versus > 53 cells/ml (relative hazard = 6.18, 95% CI 2.99-12.76) and hematocrit < or 37% versus > 37% (relative hazard = 2.27, 95% CI 1.22-4.22). The median durations of survival in the four subgroups of Cryptosporidium-infected patients defined by these two variables differed significantly from each other (range, 204-1,119 days). Cryptosporidiosis as an initial AIDS-defining diagnosis was associated with an elevated relative hazard of death in comparison with other AIDS-defining diagnoses (relative hazard = 2.01, 95% CI 1.38-2.93). These data identify the groups of HIV-infected individuals at risk for presentation with symptomatic Cryptosporidium infection; the distinct survival patterns among subgroups of those patients already infected with this parasite; and the survival of AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis relative to patients with other AIDS-defining conditions. Such information is necessary for the design of prospective studies, the development of prophylactic strategies, the evaluation of candidate therapies, and the provision of prognostic information to patients."

Seventy-one children presenting HIV-related symptoms were included in the study; 29 were less than 2 y old and 42 were 2 to 12 y of age. Results were compared with those obtained in normal children of a similar age. In HIV-infected children the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+CD45RA+ cells was significantly decreased, whereas that of CD8+, CD8+CD38+, and CD8+CD45RO+ cells was strikingly increased compared with controls. In children less than 2 y old the absolute number of CD4+ and CD8+CD45RA+ cells decreased, and the number of CD8+CD45RO+ cells increased significantly, whereas the number of CD8+ and CD8+CD38+ cells did not change. The absolute number of CD4+ T cells declined with age both among controls and among HIV-infected children. In contrast, the absolute number of CD8+ cells and CD8 subsets decreased with age only in controls but not in infected children. In HIV-1-infected children the expression of the CD38 and CD45RO markers on CD8+ cells was significantly correlated, indicating that these were activated cells. The survival of less than 2-y-old children with AIDS symptoms was positively correlated with the total number of CD8 cells and CD8+CD38+ cells at time of entry into the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
Doc No.246,2159,negative/unlabeled,11.084414,Higher frequency of premature stop codon mutations at vpu gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 CRF01_AE compared with those of other subtypes.,"Our previous study demonstrated the anti-apoptosis function of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vpu gene product in normal CD4+ T lymphocytes. In this study, using sequences obtained from the HIV sequence database, we compared vpu sequences from 184 preparations of various subtypes of HIV-1 from diverse geographical regions. Our analysis revealed that CRF01_AE isolates had premature stop codon mutations at the vpu gene at a much higher rate (36%) than other subtypes (0-9%). The premature stop codon mutations in vpu existed mostly at two amino acid residues: the methionine initiation codon and the boundary between the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains. The mutations at the latter site were more often detected in CRF01_AE. The higher mutation rates at vpu in CRF01_AE were confirmed by sequence comparison of polymerase chain reaction products newly obtained directly from the DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but not from the RNA from the plasma, in CRF01_AE- and subtype B-infected individuals. This finding may indicate the possibility that the more abundant population of HIV-1 CRF01_AE is able to induce apoptosis in CD4+ T lymphocytes than the populations of other subtypes."
Doc No.247,8073,positive/labeled,11.055937,HIV type 1 viremia on ART is positively associated with polyclonal T cell proliferation in subjects with T cell IFN-gamma secretion levels comparable to those of uninfected subjects.,"We investigated the association between plasma HIV-1 RNA, immune activation, and polyclonal T cell function in viremic subjects whether on or off antiretroviral therapy (ART). The surface expression of activation/functional molecules on T cells and monocytes as well as cytokine secretion and T cell proliferation were assessed in 23 HIV-1(-) and 79 HIV-1(+)-infected subjects with different levels of viral suppression and CD4(+) T cell count >250 cells/mm(3) for >6 months. Viral replication was associated with increased T cell and monocyte activation irrespective of ART. In subjects with a detectable viral load on ART, we found a positive association with anti-CD3/CD28-induced T cell proliferation compared to patients with undetectable viral load (<400 copies/ml). No difference among groups was observed for anti-CD3/CD28-mediated IFN-gamma responses. The presence of an unexpected positive association between polyclonal T cell proliferation and viral load in subjects with levels of T cell IFN-gamma responses comparable to those of uninfected subjects is of potential relevance to an increase in T cell activation response before the loss of polyclonal cytokine secretion and proliferation observed with disease progression. This finding suggests that T cell hyperresponsiveness may play a role in the pathogenesis of immune comorbidities on ART."
Doc No.248,8094,negative/unlabeled,11.044753,Substance abuse and psychiatric disorders in HIV-positive patients: epidemiology and impact on antiretroviral therapy.,"There is a high prevalence of substance abuse and psychiatric disorders among HIV-infected individuals. Importantly, drug and alcohol-use disorders are frequently co-morbid with depression, anxiety and severe mental illness. Not only do these disorders increase the risk of contracting HIV, they have also been associated with decreased highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) utilisation, adherence and virological suppression. The literature evaluating the relationship between substance abuse and HIV outcomes has primarily focused on injection drug users, although there has been increasing interest in alcohol, cocaine and marijuana. Similarly, the mental health literature has focused largely on depression, with a lesser focus on severe mental illness or anxiety. To date, there is little literature evaluating the association between co-occurring HIV, substance abuse and mental illness on HAART uptake, adherence and virological suppression. Adherence interventions in these populations have demonstrated mixed efficacy. Both directly observed therapy and pharmacist-assisted interventions appear promising, as do integrated behavioural interventions. However, the current intervention literature has several limitations: few of these studies are randomised, controlled trials; the sample sizes have generally been small; and co-occurring substance abuse and mental illness has not specifically been targeted in these studies. Future studies examining individual substances of abuse, psychiatric disorders and co-occurring substance abuse and psychiatric disorders on HIV outcomes will inform targeted adherence interventions."

Bone mineral density (BMD) and microarchitecture were characterized in 38 HIV-infected men on antiretroviral therapy (18 perinatally-infected, 20 adolescence-infected) and 20 uninfected men age 20 to 25 years by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT). Flow cytometry was utilized to measure CD4+/CD8+ activation (HLADR+CD38+) and senescence (CD28-CD57+) and to quantify circulating osteogenic precursor (COP) cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using antibodies to RUNX2 and osteocalcin (OCN). Telomere lengths were measured in sorted COP cells using qPCR. DXA-derived areal BMD Z-scores and HRpQCT-derived volumetric BMD (vBMD) measures were lower in HIV-infected than uninfected men. Proportion of activated and senescent CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were higher in HIV-infected than uninfected men. The percentage of COP cells (mean ± SE) was lower in HIV-infected than uninfected (0.19% ± 0.02% versus 0.43% ± 0.06%; p < 0.0001) men, and also lower in perinatally-infected than adolescence-infected men (0.15% ± 0.02% versus 0.22% ± 0.03%; p < 0.04). A higher proportion of COP cells correlated with higher bone stiffness, a measure of bone strength, whereas a higher proportion of activated CD4+ T cells correlated with lower BMD and stiffness and lower proportion of COP cells. T cell activation with HIV-infection was associated with decreased numbers of osteogenic precursors as well as lower peak bone mass and bone strength. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research."

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at positions -607(C/A) and -137(C/G) in the promoter region of the interleukin-18 (IL-18) gene and at position +874(T/A) of the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) gene are related to the expression of these cytokines. To examine whether IL-18 and IFN-gamma polymorphisms are associated with LS, these SNPs were genotyped in 88 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients presenting LS, 79 HIV-infected without LS, and 133 healthy controls. The -607A allele, -607AA genotype, and -137G/-607A and -137C/-607A haplotypes in the IL-18 gene were over-represented in HIV patients presenting LS. The -137G/-607C haplotype was associated with protection against LS. These results indicate that the -607(C/A) SNP is associated with LS development in HIV-infected patients."

Since the digestive mucosal immune system is by far the largest lymphoid organ of the body, we attempted to evaluate its functional activity in advanced stages of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in the SIV-macaque model of HIV infection. Two chronically intravenously SIV-infected macaques, including one at the AIDS stage, were studied. Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) were isolated, analyzed, and compared to lymphocytes obtained from blood, spleen, and different lymph nodes: IEL were predominantly CD8+ T lymphocytes expressing the alphaE beta7 integrin and lacking the CD28 coactivatory molecule. A direct ex vivo SIV-specific cytotoxic activity was prominently found in the IEL of both macaques and was weaker or absent in the other sites. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SIV-specific cytotoxic activity from small intestine IEL in SIV-infected macaques. Considering the high similitude of the SIV-macaque model with the HIV infection in humans, these results may be highly important for the pathogenesis of HIV infection and more generally important for the characterization and function of digestive CD8+ IEL population."

Seven anti-retroviral therapy-naïve subjects were studied in detail between 1 and 87 weeks following onset of symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection. Synthetic peptides representing the autologous transmitted/founder HIV-1 sequences were used in multiparameter flow cytometry assays to determine the functionality of HIV-1-specific CD8+ T memory cells. In all seven patients, the earliest T cell responses were predominantly oligofunctional, although the relative contribution of multifunctional cell responses increased significantly with time from infection. Interestingly, only the magnitude of the total and not of the poly-functional T-cell responses was significantly associated with the selection of escape mutants. However, the high contribution of MIP-1β-producing CD8+ T-cells to the total response suggests that mechanisms not limited to cytotoxicity could be exerting immune pressure during acute infection. Lastly, we show that epitope entropy, reflecting the capacity of the epitope to tolerate mutational change and defined as the diversity of epitope sequences at the population level, was also correlated with rate of emergence of escape mutants."

We measured the prevalence of non-infectious illnesses and their risk factors and described healthcare use in this UK population. A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at an outpatient HIV specialist clinic in south east England. Patients age ≥50 years were invited to complete questionnaires measuring demographics, non-infectious illnesses, medication use, lifestyle and healthcare utilisation. The response rate was 67%. Of 299 participants, 84% reported ≥1 comorbid condition and 61% reported ≥2 (multimorbidity). Most commonly reported were high cholesterol, sexual dysfunction, hypertension and depression. In multivariate analyses, age, number of years HIV-positive and duration of antiretroviral therapy remained significant predictors of comorbidity when controlling for lifestyle factors (exercise, smoking and use of recreational drugs and alcohol). Use of non-HIV healthcare services was associated with increasing comorbidity, a longer duration of HIV and recreational drug use. The majority of HIV-patients aged ≥50 years reported multiple comorbidities and this was associated with polypharmacy and increased use of non-HIV services. Further research examining the quality, safety and patient experience of healthcare is needed to inform development of services to optimally meet the needs of older HIV-positive patients."

It affects millions of people worldwide and is considered as a leading cause of liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A recent study reported that TLR4 gene polymorphisms are good prognostic predictors and are associated with protection from liver fibrosis among Caucasians. This study aims to investigate the implication of genetic polymorphisms of TLR4 gene on the HCV infection in Saudi Arabian patients. Two SNPs in the TLR4 gene, rs4986790 (A/G) and rs4986791 (C/T), were genotyped in 450 HCV patients and 600 uninfected controls. The association analysis confirmed that both SNPs showed a significant difference in their distribution between HCV-infected patients and uninfected control subjects (P < 0.0001; OR = 0.404, 95% CI = 0.281-0.581) and (P < 0.0001; OR = 0.298, 95% CI = 0.201-0.443), respectively. More importantly, haplotype analysis revealed that four haplotypes, AC, GT, GC, and AT (rs4986790, rs4986791), were significantly associated with HCV infection when compared with control subjects. One haplotype AC was more prominently found when chronic HCV-infected patients were compared with cirrhosis/HCC patients (frequency = 94.7% and P = 0.04). Both TLR4 SNPs under investigation were found to be significantly implicated with HCV-infection among Saudi Arabian population."

Currently, it is debated whether AZT should be offered to symptomless HIV-infected individuals in the hope of delaying or even preventing progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, before the chronic use of AZT, it is essential to establish whether this drug alters the differentiation and functions of T cells particularly because HIV infects CD4+ T cells, as well as investigate whether AZT would alter the T cell response to HIV-encoded antigens. In the current study, therefore, we investigated the effect of administration of AZT into mice for 7-14 days on T cell differentiation in the thymus and the ability of T cells to respond to HIV antigens in the periphery. Our data demonstrated that AZT, when administered orally at 500 mg/kg body wt or higher concentrations for 14 days, caused marked thymic involution with significant decrease in the percentage of CD4+CD8+ T cells and increase in the percentage of CD4-CD8-, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells. AZT treatment did not affect the cellularity of the spleen or the ratios of T cells in the periphery. Also, splenic T cells from AZT-treated mice did not demonstrate marked decrease in their ability to respond to mitogens in vitro. However, when AZT-treated mice were immunized with foreign antigens, such as gp120 of HIV or conalbumin, the T cells demonstrated significant decrease in their ability to respond to these antigens. When AZT was added to cultures, it was found to inhibit the proliferation of T cells to mitogens as well as the differentiation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Interestingly, addition of exogenous IL-2 to CTL cultures reconstituted the decreased CTL response. Furthermore, administration of IL-2 into AZT-treated mice could also reconstitute the decrease in thymic cellularity induced by AZT. These data indicate that AZT, when present at the time of T cell differentiation or responsiveness to antigens in vivo, can mediate significant inhibition of such functions thereby suggesting that AZT may affect the immune response to HIV antigens."

Accordingly, we examined if HIV infection was associated with unmet support needs among men living with and without HIV receiving community mental health care. This cross-sectional study examined 215 men (135 living with HIV and 80 without HIV) receiving case management services in urban Ontario. Using the Camberwell Assessment of Need, we ascertained the prevalence of support needs in 13 domains grouped into three clusters: Basic needs (accommodation, food, benefits, and money management); self-care/functional needs (daytime activities, self-care, and looking after the home); and health/safety needs (physical, psychological distress, psychotic symptoms, safety to self, and safety to others). We used generalized estimating equations with a logit link to examine the association between HIV and unmet need in each domain. Compared to HIV-negative men, men with HIV were more likely to have mood and concurrent disorders, and intellectual and developmental disabilities. Following multivariable analyses, men with HIV had greater unmet needs related to food (odds ratio + 95% confidence interval: 9.36 (4.03, 21.75), p < 0.001); money (OR: 1.90 (1.04, 3.47), p = 0.036) [basic need domains]; psychological distress (OR: 2.39 (1.68, 3.41), p < 0.001); drug use (OR: 5.10 (2.16, 12.08) p < 0.001); and safety to self (OR: 3.35 (1.51, 7.52), p < 0.003) [health and safety domains]. Despite living in a setting with universal health insurance, men with HIV receiving community mental health support had greater unmet need in basic and health domains than HIV-negative men receiving such support. Further research is required to develop and evaluate interventions to best support community-dwelling persons with HIV and mental health disorders."
Doc No.257,8464,negative/unlabeled,10.9587755,Replication-competent noninduced proviruses in the latent reservoir increase barrier to HIV-1 cure.,"Antiretroviral therapy fails to cure HIV-1 infection because latent proviruses persist in resting CD4(+) T cells. T cell activation reverses latency, but <1% of proviruses are induced to release infectious virus after maximum in vitro activation. The noninduced proviruses are generally considered defective but have not been characterized. Analysis of 213 noninduced proviral clones from treated patients showed 88.3% with identifiable defects but 11.7% with intact genomes and normal long terminal repeat (LTR) function. Using direct sequencing and genome synthesis, we reconstructed full-length intact noninduced proviral clones and demonstrated growth kinetics comparable to reconstructed induced proviruses from the same patients. Noninduced proviruses have unmethylated promoters and are integrated into active transcription units. Thus, it cannot be excluded that they may become activated in vivo. The identification of replication-competent noninduced proviruses indicates that the size of the latent reservoir-and, hence, the barrier to cure-may be up to 60-fold greater than previously estimated."

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in relation to anaemia and CD4 counts among HIV-infected patients in Benin City, Nigeria. Using a serial sampling method, a total of 2000 HIV-infected patients were recruited on their first visit prior to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital from August 2007 to August 2009. Stool and blood samples were collected from each patient. The stool samples were processed using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique to microscopically identify the oocysts of Cryptosporidium species, Isospora belli, Cyclospora species and spores of Microsporidium species while saline and iodine preparations were used for identifying the ova, cysts and parasites of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Taenia spp and other parasites. The blood specimens were equally analyzed using the flow cytometry for CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and autoanalyzer - sysmex kx - 21 for haemoglobin concentration. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 93.3% while 18% had parasitic infections. There was a significant relationship between CD4 count <200cells/microL and anaemia (P<0.0001). Cryptosporidium species (P= 0.005), A. lumbricoides (P=0.035), hookworm and Taenia species (P=0.014) were associated with anaemia. Anaemia was associated with CD4 count while Cryptosporidium species, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species were the intestinal parasitic agents associated with anaemia. In conclusion the prevalence of anaemia in HIV-infected patients is high low CD4 count is a significant risk factor of acquiring anaemia. Except for isosporiasis, cryptosporidiosis, A. lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species in HIV infected individuals are parasitic agents associated with anaemia. Routine screening for intestinal parasites and holistic management of anaemia is advocated."

HIV-1 phylogenetic diversity and ARV resistance mutations associated with protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) were assessed among 48 ARV-experienced patients from Goiania/Goias, central west Brazil. The gp41 resistance mutations to the fusion inhibitor (T-20) were analyzed among multidrug-resistant (MDR) patients. PR, partial RT, and gp41 genes were amplified and sequenced from plasma RNA. HIV-1 subtype was assigned by phylogenetic analysis. ARV mutations in PR/RT were analyzed by the Stanford Database. T-20 resistance mutations in gp41 were identified by Stanford, the Los Alamos Database, and other sources. Subtype B represented 79.2% (38/48), subtype F1 4.2% (2/48), subtype C 2.1% (1/48), F1(PR)/B(RT) 8.3% (4/48), and B(PR)/F1(RT) 6.3% (3/48). Secondary drug resistance was observed in 79% (38/48): NRTI resistance (n = 1), NNRTI resistance (n = 1), PI + NRTI or NRTI + NNRTI resistance (n = 20), and PI + NRTI +NNRTI resistance, considered MDR (n = 16). Almost half of the MDR patients had viral loads below 10,000 copies/ml. The gp41 sequences from 14 MDR revealed one F1(PR)/B(RT)/F1(ENV) recombinant and 13 subtype B(PR)/B(RT)/B(ENV) isolates. G36E, N42T, and N43S T-20 resistance mutations were observed in three MDR patients, two of them previously treated with T-20 and the other who had never used T-20. Our data among ARV-experienced patients showed a high proportion of drug-resistance mutations and MDR. T-20 resistance mutations were detected among MDR patients corroborating the importance of T-20 genotyping for clinical management and salvage therapy."
Doc No.260,9653,negative/unlabeled,10.939977,The CD8+ cell non-cytotoxic antiviral response affects RNA polymerase II-mediated human immunodeficiency virus transcription in infected CD4+ cells.,"A CD8+ cell non-cytotoxic antiviral response (CNAR), mediated by a CD8+ cell antiviral factor (CAF), is associated with a long-term healthy state in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. CNAR/CAF reduces viral transcription without a known effect on specific viral sequences in the HIV genome. In studies to define the mechanism involved in the block in viral transcription, we now report that transcription from the HIV-LTR reporter is reduced in infected CD4+ cells upon treatment with CAF. In agreement with this observation, the amount of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) on the HIV promoter and other viral regions was strongly diminished in HIV-infected CD4+ cells co-cultivated with CNAR-expressing CD8+ cells. These results demonstrate further that CNAR/CAF has a specific role in regulating HIV transcription and a step during the preinitiation complex assembly appears to be sensitive to CNAR/CAF. "

In the research presented here we aimed to understand the dynamics of good adherence to ART among patients receiving free ART and HIV-related services from a clinic in Arusha, Tanzania. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 6 health care providers and 36 patients at a health care center in Arusha in 2006. Interviews were conducted in Swahili using interview guides informed by social cognitive theory. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed in Kiswahili, translated into English and coded for themes and patterns with ATLAS.ti. Of the 36 patients interviewed (mean time on ART 9.8 months; range 1-23 months), 32 reported perfect adherence in the previous month. Self-reported adherence was high despite economic hardship, depression, low rates of HIV disclosure and high perceived HIV-associated stigma. Five factors emerged to explain excellent adherence in the face of such barriers. First, all respondents experienced substantial improvements in their health after starting ART; this supported their confidence in the medication and motivated them to adhere. Second, their perceived need to be able to meet their family responsibilities motivated respondents to stay healthy. Third, respondents developed specific strategies to remember to take pills, particularly routinizing pill-taking by linking it with daily activities or events. Fourth, material and emotional support received from others facilitated adherence. Finally, respondents trusted the advice and instructions of their health care providers, who regularly emphasized adherence. The facilitating factors identified were consistent with the constructs of social cognitive theory and highlighted the importance of interventions that address multiple levels of influence on adherence."
Doc No.262,485,positive/labeled,10.93683,Human immunodeficiency virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses do not predict viral growth and clearance rates during structured intermittent antiretroviral therapy.,"There is a continuing search for better ways to use existing drugs against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). One idea is to use short therapy interruptions to ""autovaccinate"" HIV-infected patients. A group of 13 chronically HIV-infected patients enrolled in a trial of such so-called structured treatment interruptions (STIs) were intensively studied with respect to their viral load (VL) and HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte [CTL]) responses. We found that 10 of the 13 patients had plateau VLs after STIs that were lower than their pretreatment VLs. While viral rebound rates became lower over STIs, there were no changes in clearance rates. Although numbers of CTLs did increase over the same time that viral rebounds decreased, there was no correlation between CTL count and either viral rebound rates or clearance rates. Finally, we asked whether absolute numbers of or changes in numbers of CTLs predict plateau VLs after STIs. No measure of CTLs was able to predict plateau VLs. Thus, there was no signature in these data of an important contribution to virological control from HIV-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes."

T-lymphocyte populations, including CD3, CD4, CD28, and adhesion molecules (L selectin, LFA-1, VLA-4, and ICAM-1) were measured by flow cytometry in a cross-sectional study of 100 HIV-infected and 49 HIV-seronegative adults. HIV-infected adults had lower numbers of CD3+ lymphocytes expressing L selectin (P < 0.0001) and VLA-4 (P < 0.01) and higher numbers of CD3+ lymphocytes expressing LFA-1bright (P < 0.002) than did HIV-negative adults. By CD4+-lymphocyte count category (>500, 200 to 500, or <200 cells/microl), HIV-infected adults with more advanced disease had lower percentages of CD3+ lymphocytes expressing L selectin and VLA-4 and higher percentages of CD3+ lymphocytes expressing LFA-1. The percentages of CD3+ CD28+ lymphocytes and of CD3+ L selectin+ lymphocytes were positively correlated (Spearman coefficient = 0.86; P < 0.0001), and the percentage of CD3+ CD28+ lymphocytes and the CD3+ LFA-1bright lymphocyte/CD3+ LFA-1dim lymphocyte ratio were negatively correlated (Spearman coefficient = -0.92; P < 0.00001). The results of this study suggest that HIV infection is associated with altered expression of adhesion molecules."

Health professionals conducted face-to-face interviews and collected data from patients' electronic medical records regarding patients' demographic, clinical, and medication information, as well as their social support and perceived health status. We classified all HIV/AIDS patients into HIV monoinfected and TB coinfected, at a ratio of 2:1.Compared with the HIV monoinfected, patients with HIV/TB coinfection were more likely to be older, male, less educated, unemployed, carrying health insurance, having advanced stage of HIV infection, longer history with HIV, and other opportunistic infections. Patients coinfected with TB were also more likely to hold a negative belief that their HIV treatment could prevent exacerbations, and reported significantly worse emotional/informational support, social interaction, and perceived health status. Better social support and better self-efficacy to the HIV treatment adherence was significantly associated with better perceived health status among patients with HIV and TB coinfection.Having HIV/TB coinfection was associated with poorer perceived general well-being and mental health, particularly in those undergoing TB therapy. Our findings suggest the need for mental health referrals and medication management for coinfected individuals, as well as further efforts and policies to improve coordinated care."

The results were evaluated statistically. An increase in the absolute number of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in HIV infected patients without clinical symptoms, ARC or AIDS was seen in the connective tissue stroma when compared with normal oral mucosa from sero-negative patients. However, the ratio between CD4+/CD8+ cells was decreased due to the disproportionate increase of CD8+ cells. These findings did not show statistical correlation with the clinical status of the infection. In contrast to the increase in absolute number of CD4+/CD8+ cells the number of Langerhans cells was unchanged when compared with the control group. Using four different monoclonal antibodies against virus structural proteins (2 X anti p24, gp41, gp120) two of 26 patients showed labelled cells in consecutive sections in the same connective tissue areas. It was assumed that latently infected mononuclear cells invaded the oral mucosa together with uninfected cells of the cellular immune system."

Doc No.267,3629,positive/labeled,10.836918,Impact of an adherence program to antiretroviral treatment on virologic response in a cohort of multitreated and poorly adherent HIV-infected patients in Spain.,"Several studies have shown the importance of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in achieving HIV-1 suppression. However, most have focused on naïve patients and do not assess the impact of HAART on viral load (VL). Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of an adherence program in a cohort of multitreated and poorly adherent patients. We performed a cohort study of all adult HIV-1 infected patients with detectable VL who were treatment experienced and poorly adherent to HAART, included in an adherence program since its introduction in 2009 (n=136). The adherence program consisted of a multidisciplinary team with a nurse who specialized in behavioral intervention, counselling on substance abuse, and motivational interviewing, as well as a social worker responsible for referring patients to local healthcare centers. Effectiveness was evaluated as percentage of patients with VL <50 copies/mL at week 48 by modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis. Initially, 76.6% of the patients had an adherence <30% according to the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ). At 48 weeks, 48.1% of the patients had VL <50 copies/mL, and the adherence was >90% in 71% of the patients. In multivariate analysis, a ratio of bottle refill per month >0.9 during the study [odds ratio (OR) 14.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.08-50.08, p<0.001] and being on a b.i.d. regimen (OR 12.5; 95% CI 1.81-86.4, p=0.010) were associated with an undetectable VL. In conclusion, the adherence program was successful in almost half of the patients, despite their long treatment experience and prior poor adherence. This strategy may help to prevent disease progression and the risk of HIV transmission in these patients."

A new study in rhesus monkeys treated with a DNA vaccine (Barouch et al.) demonstrates that a powerful vaccine-induced CD8(+) cytolytic T cell response reduces the amount of virus in the blood to very low levels preventing the drastic decrease in CD4(+) T helper cells and subsequent immunodeficiency. As the Perspective authors explain, vaccinating HIV patients that are receiving HAART may enable HIV levels to be permanently brought under control such that the drug treatment can eventually be stopped."

However, HIV-infected chimpanzees do not exhibit the marked immune system alterations seen in humans and remain relatively resistant to AIDS. In humans, HIV infection leads to unresponsiveness of T cells in response to TCR stimulation, associated with increased T cell death by apoptosis. In an effort to understand some of the mechanisms used to limit lentivirus infection in African nonhuman primates, we compared apoptosis in infected humans vs chimpanzees in CD4 and CD8 T cells in relation with the expression of Bcl-2 and Fas molecules. The intensity of apoptosis in CD4 and CD8 T cells from infected chimpanzees was very low, was not inducible by several TCR-dependent activators, and was comparable to that detected in noninfected chimpanzees. Moreover, CD45RO+ and HLA-DR+ subsets, which were shown to exhibit ex vivo a high propensity to undergo apoptosis in infected humans, were not modified in infected chimpanzees. Interestingly, in contrast to the situation found in infected humans, Fas ligation by agonistic Abs or recombinant human Fas ligand on CD4 and CD8 T cells from infected chimpanzees did not induce apoptosis in these subsets even when Bcl-2 was down-regulated. Finally, this resistance to apoptosis was associated with the predominance of CD3 T cells with a Th1 phenotype. Together these observations argue for a strong relationship among the absence of chronic immune stimulation in HIV-1-infected chimpanzees, the normal control of lymphocyte survival, and the resistance to disease progression."
Doc No.270,3284,negative/unlabeled,10.768496,Public health consequences of screening patients for adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy.,"Improvements in HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been accompanied by increasing recognition of the importance of adherence to treatment regimens for maximizing patient benefits while minimizing the emergence of drug-resistant virus. Whether clinicians should screen patients for adherence and only administer therapy to those believed likely to adhere has not been resolved. We first examine the implications of data drawn from a recent study reporting physicians' ability to predict whether patients will adhere to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or not. We then extend previously developed mathematical models of ART to include screening for adherence and focus on resulting drug resistance as well as on HIV and AIDS incidence at the population level. We show that although screening for adherence is likely to reduce the level of drug resistance compared with a policy of treating all HIV patients with HAART, rates of new HIV infections and AIDS cases in the population would likely increase unless screening accuracy is extremely (perhaps implausibly) high."

Doc No.272,8968,negative/unlabeled,10.751337,Interaction of acute feline herpesvirus-1 and chronic feline immunodeficiency virus infections in experimentally infected specific pathogen free cats.,"Cats with or without chronic feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection were exposed to feline herpesvirus, type 1 (FHV-1). FIV infected cats became sicker than non-FIV infected cats and required more supportive treatment. However, there were no differences in the length of their illness or in the levels and duration of FHV-1 shedding. FHV-1 infection caused a transient neutrophilia at Day 7 with a rapid return to preinfection levels. The neutrophilia coincided with a transient lymphopenia that was accompanied by a decline in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes. A brief decrease in the CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio occurred at Day 14 in both FIV infected and non-infected cats. This decrease was mainly the result of an absolute and transient increase in CD8+ T-lymphocytes. CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte numbers and CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratios returned to baseline within 4-8 weeks in both FIV infected and non-infected cats. FIV infected cats produced less FHV-1 neutralizing antibodies during the first 3 weeks of infection than non-FIV infected animals. The IgM FHV-1 antibody response was depressed in FIV infected cats whereas the IgG antibody response was unaffected. FHV-1 infection evoked a comparable transient loss of lymphocyte blastogenic responses to concanavalin A and pokeweed mitogen in both FIV infected and non-infected cats. However, response to pokeweed mitogen took longer to return to normal in FIV infected animals. Lymphocytes from FIV infected cats had a greater and more sustained proliferative response to FHV-1 antigen than non-FIV infected cats. The ongoing IgG antibody response to FIV was not affected by FHV-1 infection."

The experience with treatment of infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has changed the way healthcare workers deal with viral infections and has triggered a growing rate of discovery and use of antiviral agents, the first fruits of the expanding genomics revolution. HIV treatment also provides an informative paradigm for pharmacogenomics because control of infection and its consequences is limited by the development of viral drug resistance and by host factors. This report summarizes studies published to date on the significance of testing of HIV-1 resistance to antiretroviral drugs. The only Food and Drug Administration-approved kit is commercially available through Visible Genetics, Inc., for HIV drug resistance testing by genotypic sequencing. Genotyping sequencing alone is most likely an adequate test to assist in the therapeutic decision-making process in cases of previous regimen failure, treatment-naïve patients in areas of high prevalence of transmitted resistant virus, and pregnant women. However, in exceptional cases of highly complex mutation patterns and extensive cross-resistance, it may be useful to obtain a phenotype test, because that result may more easily identify drugs to which the virus is least resistant. There are no published clinical trial results on the usefulness of the so-called virtual phenotype over genotypic sequencing alone. The paradigm of viral pharmacogenomics in the form of HIV genotypic sequencing has been not only useful to the treatment of other viral diseases but also important to the real-life implementation of the growing discipline of genomics or molecular medicine. The application of this paradigm to the thousands of potential therapeutic targets that have become available through the various human genome projects will certainly gradually change the landscape of diagnosis and management of many diseases, including cancer."

Dolutegravir provides distinct advantages compared with first generation integrase inhibitors. Unlike raltegravir, dolutegravir can be given once daily for patients who are antiretroviral treatment naïve. Once-a-day dolutegravir dosing also does not require a pharmacokinetic booster like elvitegravir which minimizes the drug-drug interaction potential of dolutegravir. In Phase III clinical trials, dolutegravir-containing regimens have demonstrated either non-inferiority or superiority to current first line agents such as raltegravir, darunavir/ritonavir, and efavirenz containing regimens. Moreover, dolutegravir may be effective for patients with a history of raltegravir and/or elvitegravir resistance. Dolutegravir will likely play a major role in the management of patients with HIV-1 infection, and will be aided when coformulation with abacavir/lamivudine as a single pill, once-daily regimen is available.

Doc No.275,6426,negative/unlabeled,10.689183,Effect of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease inhibitor therapy and subtype on development of resistance in subtypes B and G.,"Europe is currently observing a significant rise in non-B subtypes. Consequently, the effect of genetic variability on therapy response or genotypic resistance interpretation algorithms is an emerging concern. The purpose of this study is to investigate the amino acid substitutions selected under drug pressure in the protease of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes B and G, and determine if there are any significant differences. We investigated therapy-related and subtype-related substitutions in the protease, considering subtype, overall protease inhibitor treatment and individual drug exposure. Many mutations were significantly related to protease inhibitor (PI) therapy, with mutations exclusive to subtype B or subtype G. Some mutations are at positions related to resistance in both subtypes, but the amino acid substitution is different. Other mutations were significantly associated with subtype and PI selective pressure (p<0.05), pointing towards a differential selective pressure in both subtypes. We confirmed previous reports on the subtype-dependent selection of D30N and 89I, and identified a new mutation with such differential selective pressure: 37D was preferentially selected by lopinavir in subtype B. Other novel mutations found under therapy pressure were 13A, 35N, K55R, I66F, I72L/T, T74S, 82M and 89I/V. Our study indicates that even though in general, drug selective pressure and resistance pathways are relatively similar between subtypes B and G, some differences do occur, leading to subtype-dependent substitutions."
Doc No.276,2113,negative/unlabeled,10.68538,Long terminal repeat and nef gene variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in perinatally infected long-term survivors and rapid progressors.,"HIV-1 sequences from perinatally infected children were analyzed in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region and nef in order to investigate associations of viral variation and disease progression. Four long-term survivors who reached 10 years of age or older, and four rapid progressors who survived less than 2 years, participated in this study. LTR sequences of multiple independent viral variants from each individual were compared. No sequence pattern within the LTR consistently distinguished long-term survivors from rapid progressors or vice versa. Deletions and insertions within transcription factor binding sites of the LTR and nef ranging from 8 to 341 bp were found in viral variants from the eldest long-term survivor (LTS047). These deletions and duplications may be associated with the survival of LTS047 via an unknown mechanism. Among all children in this study, the sites in the untranslated region (NF-kappaB, SP1, and TATA box) were more conserved than the sites in the nef/LTR overlap region (NFAT, purine-rich region, USF, TCF1alpha), reflecting the importance of the sites in the untranslated region for viral replication. A mutation in the E box motif within the USF site among the sequences from a long-term survivor (LTS113) is predicted to disrupt protein binding and may be associated with slow disease progression. Mutations of the SP1-III site in a rapid progressor (RP056) indicate that this site is not necessary for rapid disease progression."

This was assessed by evaluating T cell subset changes in individuals who received a salvage regimen of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) after initially failing protease inhibitor monotherapy. Ten HIV-1-infected asymptomatic patients received a regimen of indinavir, zidovudine, and 3TC after failing saquinavir monotherapy. Changes in absolute numbers of naive, memory, and activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing a selection of CD45RA, CD62L, CD45RO, HLA-DR, and CD38 markers were monitored prospectively over 6 months. These measurements were correlated with plasma viral load along with alterations in a selected CD8+ V alpha/Vbeta T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Over 6 months there was a progressive increase in numbers of CD4+ memory (CD45RA-CD62L+) and naive (CD45RA+CD62L+) T cells, which displayed a modest inverse correlation with viral load. Two phases of CD8+ memory cell changes were identified, consisting of a transient increase in CD45RA+CD62L- numbers after 2 months and thereafter a progressive rise in CD45RA-CD62L+ cells until 6 months. A strong correlation existed between reduced viral load and loss of activated CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+ cell numbers. There was also a temporary broadening of the CD8+ V alpha/Vbeta TCR repertoire at 8 weeks, which became skewed after 6 months in parallel with reduced viral suppression. Closer analysis of naive and memory cell subset proportions in individual patients revealed that enlarged pools of naive subsets were evident in those patients with rebounds in viral load. Overall, drug-experienced patients responding to HAART displayed increased numbers of naive and memory CD4+ subsets, and reduced CD8+ cell activation with a loss of TCR skewing."

Both infections are common in endemic areas because these viruses share similar routes of transmission. The aim of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of HTLV1/2 in a population of HIV1-infected patients in the state of Goiás, Midwestern Brazil. Of the 505 studied patients, four (0.79%) were positive for anti-HTLV1/2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with HTLV1 infection confirmed by line immunoassay (LIA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all of the ELISA-positive samples. No cases of HTLV2 infection were observed. The prevalence of HTLV1/HIV1 coinfection was 0.79% (4/505; 95% CI: 0.25-2.16). All the coinfected patients reported sexual risk behaviors and only one reported intravenous drug use. Sequencing of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) region and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the four HTLV1 isolates belonged to the Transcontinental a subgroup of the Cosmopolitan (1a) subtype, the most frequent subgroup detected in Brazil. This study shows a low prevalence of HTLV1/2 in HIV1-infected patients in Midwestern Brazil."

The study was prematurely terminated to new enrollment because of the emergence of genetic mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs in 5 patients. After 48 weeks, there was no significant difference between groups in lipid, hepatic transaminase, and C-reactive protein levels in 41 patients. Although there were no differences in CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cell counts or the percentage of cells that were CD4(+)CD25(+), CD8(+)CD25(+), or CD4(+)DR(+), patients who received SIT had a significantly higher percentage of CD8(+)CD38(+) and CD8(+)DR(+) cells. There was no clear autoimmunization effect by immunologic or virologic parameters. There was no benefit to long-cycle SIT versus continuous HAART with regard to certain toxicity, immunologic, or virologic parameters."

In a nationally representative sample of HIV-infected adults receiving medical care, 86% self-reported taking all ART doses in the past 72 hours. Overall, 20% reported using adherence support services and 2% reported an unmet need for services. If all nonadherent persons not receiving adherence support and all persons with a self-perceived unmet need for adherence support accessed services, resources to support ∼42,673 additional persons would be needed. Factors associated with lower adherence included younger age, female gender, depression, stimulant use, binge alcohol use, greater than once-daily dosing, longer time since HIV diagnosis, and patient beliefs. Predictors of adherence are multifactorial so multiple targeted strategies to improve adherence are warranted. Providing adherence support services to all those in need may require additional resources. "

By use of flow cytometry, transient high-level TCR beta-chain variable region-specific expansions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were observed more frequently in HIV-infected children than in children exposed to HIV who remained uninfected. TCR beta-chain diversity analysis and diversity-specific polymerase chain reaction were used to study the clonality of expanded CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. In CD8+ T cells, structural features of the complement-determining regions 3 were altered during the course of the expansion, and persistent TCR clonotypes were observed, consistent with antigen-driven selection. In contrast, TCR beta-chain variable region-specific expansions without clonotypic overrepresentation or persistence were observed in CD4+ T cells, possibly related to HIV-specific helper T cell responses or to the progressive destruction of the CD4+ cell compartment."
Doc No.282,781,negative/unlabeled,10.645045,Gamma delta T cell receptor subsets in the lung of patients with HIV-1 infection.,"In this study the frequency of gamma delta+ cells and their subsets has been assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell populations recovered from 51 patients at various clinical stages of HIV-1 infection. Thirteen out of the 51 HIV-1-infected patients showed an increase in the percentage of TCR delta 1+ BAL T cells (25.5%). BAL lymphocytes bearing pan-gamma delta antigens were also quantitatively increased in 10 patients (19.6%). A strict correlation was observed between the degree of CD8 alveolitis and the increase of gamma delta T cells. Phenotypic study of BAL gamma delta cells revealed that (a) V delta 2-related BB3+ cells accounted for the majority of lung gamma delta T cells; (b) these cells were CD45RO+ memory cells and expressed a series of adhesion molecules; and (c) 29% of BAL gamma delta T cells expressed CD8 surface molecules. We also compared the distribution of V delta 2 and V delta 1 subsets in paired samples of peripheral blood and BAL fluid. Patients who showed an increased number of BB3+ cells in the BAL fluid presented a reversal of the V delta 2 to V delta 1 cell ratio in the peripheral blood. By contrast, in the lung of normal subjects pulmonary BB3+ and A13+ cells were present in approximately the same proportions found in the peripheral blood. Taken together these data demonstrate that a redistribution of T cells expressing V delta 2 TCR takes place in the lung of a subset of patients with HIV-1 infection and CD8 alveolitis. In the pulmonary microenvironment these cells might play a role in the local immune response against HIV-1 and/or opportunistic infections."
Doc No.283,4003,negative/unlabeled,10.643434,Tenofovir for the treatment of hepatitis B virus.,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in adults. Tenofovir has been available in the United States for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since 2001. It blocks HBV replication in liver cells and is available as a once-daily oral formulation. The efficacy of tenofovir for the treatment of chronic HBV has been demonstrated to be superior to adefovir in randomized controlled trials, which led to its FDA approval for use in chronic HBV. Because of its potent antiviral activity, favorable safety profile, and higher barrier to the development of resistance, tenofovir should replace adefovir as a first-line monotherapy option in the treatment of HBV in monoinfected patients. In the HIV-HBV-coinfected population, tenofovir is already a preferred agent in combination with other anti-HBV agents (lamivudine or emtricitabine), which are cotreatments for HIV as well. In addition, tenofovir monotherapy or in combination with nucleoside analogs are options for patients who have developed resistance to other therapies for chronic HBV, including lamivudine and adefovir."
Doc No.284,3619,negative/unlabeled,10.638653,Multiple cis-acting elements in the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 enhancer mediate the response to T-cell receptor stimulation by antigen in a T-cell hybridoma line.,"Transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 long terminal repeat (HIV-2 LTR) responds to T-cell antigen receptor signaling. Agents that stimulate T-cell signaling pathways activated by the antigen receptor, such as phorbol ester, plant lectin, or anti-CD3 antibody treatment, have been shown to increase transcription directed by the HIV-2 LTR. In this study, we examine the activation of the HIV-2 LTR in T cells stimulated with the physiologic ligand of the T-cell receptor, antigenic peptide presented by a major histocompatibility molecule. HIV-2 reporter plasmids were transfected into the antigen-specific T-cell hybridoma, 2B4.11, where they responded to antigen-dependent activation. This antigen-mediated transcriptional activation of the HIV-2 enhancer required the presence of at least four regulatory elements in the HIV-2 enhancer, including two purine boxes, PuB1 and PuB2, an AP-1/CREB-like element (pets), and kappa B. This finding suggests that signals emanating from the antigen receptor act coordinately on a set of transcription factors that bind to conserved HIV-2 regulatory elements. Despite differences in the organization of potentially related enhancer elements in HIV-2 and IL-2, these enhancers exploit a similar signal transduction pathway to induce gene expression in antigen-activated T cells."

The Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database was interrogated and showed that 23% of patients treated with nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTI) had mutations at codon 69. These variants included T69N, -S, -A, -G, -E, -I, and -K mutations that were present in patients treated with NRTI but not in drug-naive patients. Treatment history information showed that a substantial percentage of these codon 69 changes occurred in patients administered non-ddC-containing regimens. Different and specific patterns of other RT gene mutations were associated with the various codon 69 mutations. Drug susceptibility assays showed that viral constructs containing codon 69 variants could have reduced susceptibility to ddC and other RT inhibitors. These results suggest that the T69D mutation is not the only codon 69 variant associated with drug resistance and that ddC is not the only drug affected."
Doc No.286,4405,negative/unlabeled,10.6179905,Acute HIV infection with rapid progression to AIDS.,"Acute HIV infection is rarely recognized as the signs and symptoms are normally unspecific and can persist for days or weeks. The normal HIV course is characterized by a progressive loss of CD4+ cells, which normally leads to severe immunodeficiency after a variable time interval. The mean time from initial infection to development of clinical AIDS is approximately 8-10 years, but it is variable among individuals and depends on a complex interaction between virus and host. Here we describe an extraordinary case of a man who developed Pneumocisits jiroveci pneumonia within one month after sexual exposure to HIV-1, and then presented with 3 consecutive CD4 counts bellow 200 cells/mm³ within 3 months, with no other opportunistic disease. Although antiretroviral therapy (AZT+3TC+ATZ/r) was started, with full adherence of the patient, and genotyping indicating no primary antiretroviral resistance mutations, he required more than six months to have a CD4 restoration to levels above 200 cells/mm³ and 10 months to HIV-RNA to become undetectable."
Doc No.287,9151,negative/unlabeled,10.615894,Viremia control despite escape from a rapid and potent autologous neutralizing antibody response after therapy cessation in an HIV-1-infected individual.,"The neutralizing Ab response after primary HIV-1 infection is delayed relative to the virus-specific CD8(+) T cell response and the initial decline in plasma viremia. Because nearly all HIV-1 infections result in AIDS, it would be instructive to study cases where neutralizing Ab production commenced sooner. This was done in subject AC10, an individual treated during early infection and in whom a rapid autologous neutralizing Ab response was detected after therapy cessation as rebound viremia declined and remained below 1000 RNA copies/ml of blood for over 2.5 years. This subject's Abs were capable of reducing the infectivity of his rebound virus by >4 logs in vitro at a time when rebound viremia was down-regulated and virus-specific CD8(+) T cells were minimal, suggesting that neutralizing Abs played an important role in the early control of viremia. The rebound virus did not exhibit an unusual phenotype that might explain its high sensitivity to neutralization by autologous sera. Neutralization escape occurred within 75 days and was proceeded by neutralizing Ab production to the escape variant and subsequent escape. Notably, escape was not associated with a significant rise in plasma viremia, perhaps due to increasing CD8(+) T cell responses. Sequence analysis of gp160 revealed a growing number of mutations over time, suggesting ongoing viral evolution in the face of potent antiviral immune responses. We postulate that an early effective neutralizing Ab response can provide long-term clinical benefits despite neutralization escape."
Doc No.288,1377,negative/unlabeled,10.605768,Double Filtration Plasmapheresis in Treatment of Patients With Co-Infection of Hepatitis C and Human Immunodeficiency Virus.,"One of the main causes of mortality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are complications of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). Combining drug therapy for HCV with double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) has significantly increased the effectiveness of treatment for these patients. However, there are no data on the use of this method for the treatment of patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. We demonstrated that positive clinical effect in the treatment of HCV patients by DFPP (previously demonstrated) is also achieved in the treatment of HIV infected patients, co-infected with HCV. The obtained efficiency of 62.5% is almost two times higher than the predicted treatment efficiency. We can conclude that the complex therapy of hepatitis C, including DFPP and medication by PEG-IFN + RBV is an effective and safe approach for the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HCV and HIV.

The frequencies of HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ PBL binding HLA-A2/HIV-epitope tetramers or producing IFN-gamma were below 1%. A panel of 16 CTL epitopes covering 15 HLA class I molecules in 14 patients allowed us to test 3.8 epitopes/patient and to detect 2.2 +/- 1.8 HIV epitope-specific CD8+ subsets per patient with a median frequency of 0.24% (0.11-4. 79%). During the first month of treatment, viral load rapidly decreased and frequencies of HIV-specific CD8 PBL tripled, eight new HIV specificities appeared of 11 undetectable at entry, while CMV-specific CD8+ PBL also appeared. With efficient HIV load control, all HIV specificities decayed involving a reduction of the CD8+CD27+CD11ahigh HIV-specific effector subset. Virus rebounds triggered by scheduled drug interruptions or transient therapeutic failures induced four patterns of epitope-specific CD8+ lymphocyte dynamics, i.e., peaks or disappearance of preexisting specificities, emergence of new specificities, or lack of changes. The HIV load rebounds mobilized both effector/memory HIV- and CMV-specific CD8+ lymphocytes. Therefore, frequencies of virus-specific CD8 T cells appear to be positively correlated to HIV production in most cases during highly active antiretroviral therapy, but an inverse correlation can also be observed with rapid virus changes that might involve redistribution, sequestration, or expansion of these Ag-specific CD8 T cells. Future strategies of therapeutic interruptions should take into account these various HIV-specific cell dynamics during HIV rebounds."

Zhang et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 13:1215-1219, 2003). To characterize the intracellular mechanisms of action of DKAs, we analyzed the antiviral activities of two potent azido-containing DKAs with either a monosubstitution or a disubstitution of azido groups, using single- and multiple-replication-cycle assays. Both azido-containing DKAs significantly inhibited HIV-1 infection in 293T, CEM-SS, and H9 cells (50% inhibitory concentration = 2 to 13 micro M) and exhibited low cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration = 60 to 600 micro M). Inhibition of HIV-1 IN in vivo was demonstrated by the observation that previously described L-708,906 resistance mutations in HIV-1 IN (T66I and T66I/S153Y) also conferred resistance to the azido-group-containing DKAs. In vitro assays and in vivo analysis indicated that the DKAs did not significantly inhibit the 3' processing and selectively inhibited the strand transfer reaction. In addition, quantitative PCR indicated that two-long-terminal-repeat (2-LTR) circles were elevated in the presence of the azido-containing DKAs, confirming that HIV-1 IN was the intracellular target of viral inhibition. To gain insight into the mechanism by which the DKAs increased 2-LTR-circle formation of 3'-processed viral DNAs, we performed extensive DNA sequencing analysis of 2-LTR-circle junctions. The results indicated that the frequency of deletions at the circle junctions was elevated from 19% for the untreated controls to 32 to 41% in the presence of monosubstituted (but not disubstituted) DKAs. These results indicate that the structure of the DKAs can influence the extent of degradation of viral DNA ends by host nucleases and the frequency of deletions at the 2-LTR-circle junctions. Thus, sequencing analysis of 2-LTR-circle junctions can elucidate the intracellular mechanisms of action of HIV-1 IN inhibitors."

This study characterized the prevalence of cigarette smoking among HIV-infected Russian women and examined the association between smoking frequency and quantity and HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. HIV-infected Russian women (N = 250; M age = 30.0) in St. Petersburg, Russia, completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview survey assessing cigarette use, antiretroviral medication adherence, and provided blood samples assayed for HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. The majority (60.4%) reported cigarette smoking in the past month; 49.0% of recent smokers were classified as moderate or heavy smokers, defined as smoking ≥10 cigarettes daily. Viral load status did not differ between infrequent smokers and regular smokers. However, moderate/heavy smokers (relative to light smokers) were more likely to have a detectable viral load (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.1). There were no significant differences in CD4+ lymphocyte counts by smoking frequency or quantity of cigarettes smoked. Results highlight the need for additional research to examine the association between cigarette smoking and virologic suppression and markers of HIV disease progression. Adverse health consequences of cigarette smoking coupled with a potential link between heavy smoking and poor virologic suppression highlight the need for assessment of cigarette use and provision of evidence-based smoking-cessation interventions within HIV medical care."

A novel class of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors, peroxovanadium (pV) compounds, were tested for a putative effect on HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) activity. We found that these PTP inhibitors markedly enhanced HIV-1 LTR activity in 1G5 cells, a stably transfected cell line that harbors an HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase construct. A direct correlation between the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation and the level of HIV-1 LTR inducibility was seen after treatment with three different pV compounds. Transient transfection experiments were carried out in several T cell lines, and after addition of pV, a marked increase in HIV-1 LTR activity was measured. Monocytoid cells were tested using U937-derived cell lines and were also found to be sensitive to the pV-mediated potentiating effect on HIV-1 LTR activity. A significant reduction of the pV-mediated increase in HIV-1 LTR activity was seen in cells transiently transfected with an HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase construct bearing a mutation in both NF-kappaB binding sites although detectable levels of induction remained. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays allowed the identification of the nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB p50.p65 heterodimer complex induced by pV compounds. A dominant negative version of the repressor IkappaBalpha mutated on serines 32 and 36 impeded pV-induced NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase activity. Western blot analysis showed a clear diminution in the protein level of IkappaBalpha starting 30 min after pV treatment of Jurkat E6.1 cells which is indicative of its degradation. On the other hand, no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was observed on IkappaBalpha itself. Finally, we tested the PTP inhibitors on four cell lines latently infected with HIV-1 and showed a consistent pV-mediated increase in virion production. Thus, our studies suggest that pV-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR activity is controlled by the nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor, which is mediated by IkappaBalpha serine phosphorylation and degradation, but also by a still undefined NF-kappaB-independent pathway."

The issue of resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) in HIV infection has not been adequately addressed in the Indian subcontinent. We compared HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) gene sequences to identify mutations present in HIV-1 patients who were ART non-responders, ART responders and drug naive. Genotypic drug resistance testing was performed by sequencing a 655-bp region of the RT gene from 102 HIV-1 patients, consisting of 30 ART-non-responding, 35 ART-responding and 37 drug-naive patients. The Stanford HIV Resistance Database (HIVDBv 6.2), IAS-USA mutation list, ANRS_09/2012 algorithm, and Rega v8.02 algorithm were used to interpret the pattern of drug resistance. The majority of the sequences (96 %) belonged to subtype C, and a few of them (3.9 %) to subtype A1. The frequency of drug resistance mutations observed in ART-non-responding, ART-responding and drug-naive patients was 40.1 %, 10.7 % and 20.58 %, respectively. It was observed that in non-responders, multiple mutations were present in the same patient, while in responders, a single mutation was found. Some of the drug-naive patients had more than one mutation. Thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs), however, were found in non-responders and naive patients but not in responders. Although drug resistance mutations were widely distributed among ART non-responders, the presence of resistance mutations in the viruses of drug-naive patients poses a big concern in the absence of a genotyping resistance test."

The APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide 3G) protein is a component of innate antiviral immunity that inhibits HIV-1 replication. In the present study, a total of 483 HIV-1 seropositive men and 493 HIV-1 seronegative men were selected to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the APOBEC3G gene and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and AIDS progression among MSM residing in northern China. Genotyping of four SNPs (rs5757465, rs3736685, rs8177832, and rs2899313) of the APOBEC3G was performed using the SNPscan™ Kit, while the rs2294367 polymorphism was genotyped using the SNaPshot multiplex system.

Abnormal salivary gland radiotracer activity was seen in 13 patients with diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS), five patients with undifferentiated salivary gland disease (USD), and 10 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). More DILS patients (54%) had intense gallium uptake than did the AIDS and USD patients combined (13%) (P less than .05). DILS patients had markedly elevated CD8 cell counts and moderately reduced CD4 cell counts, while AIDS patients had normal CD8 cell counts and markedly reduced CD4 cell counts. These differences were statistically significant (P less than .05). The authors recommend that DILS be considered in the differential diagnosis when abnormal, particularly intense, bilateral salivary gland gallium uptake occurs in HIV-infected patients. This disease is more likely to occur when circulating CD8 lymphocytosis is present, while AIDS is the more likely diagnosis when the patient has a normal CD8 cell count and a markedly depressed CD4 cell count."

Doc No.297,1213,negative/unlabeled,10.541882,Lymphocyte autoantibodies and alloantibodies in HIV-positive haemophilia patients.,"Immune parameters were studied in 86 haemophilia patients (six with AIDS) and 87 healthy controls. We found lymphocytotoxic alloantibodies in HIV-positive (HIV+) sera which reacted preferentially with B lymphocytes but also with T lymphocytes, and which reacted more frequently at 4 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. The antibodies were not directed against HIV-induced structures on T lymphocytes and they were reactive with both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. In addition to cytotoxic alloantibodies, cytotoxic autoantibodies were detected which coated patient lymphocytes in vivo. Increased proportions of in vivo-antibody-coated-cells were found in 37 of 86 haemophilia patients. Antibody binding was labile so that the immunoglobulins were partially removed from the lymphocyte surface by washing. The autoreactive antibodies were of IgG and IgM type, fixed complement as demonstrated by increased anti-C3d+ cells in the patients' blood, and reacted with CD4+ as well as CD8+ lymphocytes. There was a statistically significant correlation of increased Ig+ cells with HIV infection, decreased CD4/CD8 ratios, increased serum neopterin levels, and abnormal in-vitro responses to pooled allogeneic stimulator cells or CD3 monoclonal antibody. Patients with increased Ig+ cells were lymphopenic, had decreased absolute counts of CD4+, CD25+, CD21+ and OKM5+ cells, and higher percentages of CD8+ and OKIa1+ cells in their blood than patients with normal levels of Ig+ cells. Our data suggest a role of autoreactive anti-lymphocyte antibodies in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency."

We studied a murine model of AIDS, the CD4C/HIV transgenic (Tg) mouse model, to assess the importance of the apoptotic pathway in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pathogenesis. In these Tg mice, Nef is the major determinant of the disease and is expressed in immature and mature CD4(+) T cells and in cells of the macrophage/myeloid lineage. We report here a novel AIDS-like phenotype: enhanced death, most likely by apoptosis (as assessed by 7-aminoactinomycin D and annexin V/propidium iodide staining), of Tg thymic and peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. The Tg CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were also more susceptible to cell death after activation in vitro in mixed lymph node (LN) cultures. However, activation-induced cell death was not higher in Tg than in non-Tg-purified CD4(+) T cells. In addition, expression of Fas and FasL, assessed by flow cytometry, was increased in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from Tg mice compared to that of non-Tg littermates. Despite the enhanced expression of Fas and FasL on Tg CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, Fas (lpr/lpr) and FasL (gld/gld) mutant CD4C/HIV Tg mice developed an AIDS-like disease indistinguishable from lpr/+ and gld/+ CD4C/HIV Tg mice, including loss of CD4(+) T cells. Similarly, CD4C/HIV Tg mice homozygous for mutations of two other genes implicated in cell death (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme [ICE], tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 [TNFR-1]) developed similar AIDS-like disease as their respective heterozygous controls. Moreover, the double-Tg mice from a cross between the Bcl2/Wehi25 and CD4C/HIV Tg mice showed no major protection against disease. These results represent genetic evidence for the dispensable role of Fas, FasL, ICE, and TNFR-1 on the development of both T-cell loss and organ disease of these Tg mice. They also provide compelling evidence on the lack of protection by Bcl2 against Tg CD4(+)-T-cell death. In view of the high resemblance between numerous phenotypes observed in the CD4C/HIV Tg mice and in human AIDS, our findings are likely to be relevant for the human disease."

Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can regulate an inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MMP-3 and -9 genes on the susceptibility to persistent HBV infection. We studied 489 Korean patients with HBV infection (144 inactive carriers, 182 chronic hepatitis, and 163 liver cirrhosis) and 174 healthy individuals who had recovered from HBV infection. MMP-3 gene SNPs were identified at two polymorphic sites (codon 45 [E45K] and codon 96 [D96D]) and MMP-9 gene SNPs at three polymorphic sites (codon 279 [R279Q], codon 607 [G607G], and codon 668 [Q668R]) in study subjects. The frequency of T allele at third position of codon 96 in the MMP-3 gene was higher in HBV persistence patients when analyzed by co-dominant model (age- and sex-adjusted OR=1.242, 95% CI= 1.001-1.540, p=0.049). In conclusion the T allele at the third position of codon 96 in the MMP-3 gene might be associated with persistent HBV infection."
Doc No.300,2151,negative/unlabeled,10.517024,Role of SP1-binding domains in in vivo transcriptional regulation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat.,"Five regions of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) have been shown to be important in the transcriptional regulation of HIV in HeLa cells. These include the negative regulatory, enhancer, SP1, TATA, and TAR regions. Previous studies in which purified SP1 was used showed that the three SP1-binding sites in the HIV LTR were important in the in vitro transcription of this promoter. However, no studies to ascertain the role of each of these SP1-binding sites in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation in vivo have been reported. To determine the role of SP1 sites in transcriptional regulation of the HIV LTR in vivo, these sites were subjected to oligonucleotide mutagenesis both individually and in groups. The constructs were tested by DNase I footprinting with both oligonucleotide affinity column-purified SP1 and partially purified HeLa extract and by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in both the presence and absence of the tat gene. Mutagenesis of each SP1-binding site resulted in minimal changes in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation. Mutations involving alterations of SP1 sites I and II, I and III, or II and III also resulted in minimal decreases in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation. However, mutagenesis of all three SP1-binding sites resulted in a marked decrease in tat induction. The latter mutation also greatly decreased DNase I protection over the enhancer, TATA, and TAR regions when partially purified HeLa nuclear extract was used. Mutagenesis of the HIV LTR SP1 sites which converted them to consensus high-affinity SP1-binding sites with the sequence GGGGCGGGGC resulted in increased tat-induced gene expression compared with the wild-type HIV LTR template. These results suggest that SP1, through its interaction with other DNA-binding proteins, is critical for in vivo transcriptional regulation of HIV."

Recent studies suggest that stimulation of HIV-1-specific CTL responses is important for effective vaccination against HIV-1. While quantitative measurements of SIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses have been facilitated by the use of tetrameric peptide complexes, this technique is currently limited to the study of Mamu-A*01-positive rhesus macaques. Furthermore, very few SIV-specific CTL epitopes have been identified, and there is limited identification of other MHC alleles in macaques. In this study, cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) was used to quantify SIV-specific CD8+ antigen-reactive T cells in macaques infected with SIV. We found a strong correlation (r = 0.96, P < 0.001) between CD8+ antigen-reactive T cells stained with the Mamu-A*01 p11C, C-M tetramer and production of intracellular TNF-alpha in the CFC assay. Furthermore, the CFC assay was used to identify a novel SIV-specific CTL epitope in Envelope (SIV Env, a.a. 486-494, sequence AEVAELYRL). The use of the CFC assay facilitates the study of antigen-reactive T cell responses in SIV infection and vaccination."
Doc No.302,8225,positive/labeled,10.507376,Long-term suppression of plasma viremia with highly active antiretroviral therapy despite virus evolution and very limited selection of drug-resistant genotypes.,"HIV-1 evolution and the possible emergence of mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral inhibitors have been evaluated in a cohort of sixty-three patients successfully treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The patients under effective HAART were recruited in three different hospitals in Spain, and none of them had been treated (naïve) before entering this study. HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined, and nucleotide sequences of proviral regions encoding protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) were obtained for longitudinal blood samples spanning a mean follow-up period of 88 weeks. Phylogenetic reconstructions and calculations of genetic distances among the different sequences of each patient were performed. All except one of the patients under study showed an early and sustained decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA to levels that were below 200 copies/ml. The plasma viral decline paralleled a significant increase in the CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. Amino acid sequence analyses revealed the occurrence of mutations associated with antiretroviral resistance in nine patients (14.3%) during HAART treatment, that in some cases could be attributed to excess G to A transitions. In six of the nine patients, the mutations conferred resistance to inhibitors administered in the treatment regime, although the mutations did not result in treatment failure. Sequence comparisons revealed viral evolution during the period of treatment in 47.5% of the patients. The results indicate successful suppression of HIV-1 under HAART for extended time periods, indistinguishable for patients in which evidence of virus evolution could or could not be documented."
Doc No.303,10002,negative/unlabeled,10.465919,Infectious potential of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase mutants with altered inhibitor sensitivity.,"There is considerable interest in the potential of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to develop drug resistance, especially as 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (Retrovir) is now in widespread clinical use to treat people with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC). To address this possibility, mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase [deoxynucleoside-triphosphate:DNA deoxynucleotidyltransferase (RNA-directed), EC 2.7.7.49] gene have been introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of cloned constructs in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the recombinant mutant reverse transcriptase from a number of these constructs revealed enzymes that maintained enzyme activity but had a reduced ability to recognize inhibitors such as azidothymidine triphosphate. To assess the infectivity of these mutants, several constructs of proviral HIV clones with mutant reverse transcriptase genes have been made and used to transfect T cells. All five mutants tested have lower infectious potential, suggesting considerable levels of reverse transcriptase activity are required for efficient virus replication. Viable virus recovered from two clones showed decreased sensitivity to the antiviral compound phosphonoformate, thus demonstrating the potential for drug-resistant HIV to replicate. However, although the reverse transcriptase from these mutant viruses showed decreased sensitivity to azidothymidine triphosphate, paradoxically these viruses were hypersensitive to azidothymidine when tested in culture."

Ideally, expression of the anti-HIV-1 gene constructs should be induced during early stages of infection to combat high turnover of the replicating virus. In this study, we investigated the activity of two promoters, HIV-1 long terminal repeat (HIV-1-LTR) and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) LTR fused with the transactivation response element (TAR) from the HIV-1-LTR (ie RSV-TAR) in presence of Tat, the major HIV-1 transcriptional transactivator and an early gene product in HIV-1 infection. Comparative expression from both of these plasmids was analyzed by measuring expression of a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), after transfection of the promoter-CAT constructs and a Tat-expressing plasmid into CEM T lymphocytic cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The HIV-1-LTR could be transactivated by Tat in both unstimulated and stimulated cells. Although the RSV-TAR had a relatively high basal level of expression, Tat transactivation of this chimeric promoter occurred only in unstimulated cells. These results suggest that the HIV-1-LTR may be a better promoter for therapeutic gene expression in anti-HIV-1 intracellular immunization approaches."
Doc No.305,31,positive/labeled,10.434296,Natural suppression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication is mediated by transitional memory CD8+ T cells.,"HIV replication is suppressed in vitro by a CD8(+) cell noncytotoxic antiviral response (CNAR). This activity directly correlates with an asymptomatic clinical state. The objective of this study was to identify the phenotype of CD8(+) cell subsets having strong CNAR activity. CD8(+) cell subset frequencies and CNAR levels were measured for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected individuals and three groups of HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals: asymptomatic individuals with low-level viremia (vHIV), antiretroviral-drug-treated subjects with undetectable virus levels (TxHIV), and therapy-naïve aviremic elite controllers (EC). CD8(+) cells from the vHIV individuals exhibited the highest HIV-suppressing activity and had elevated frequencies of CD45RA(-) CD27(+) and PD-1(+) (CD279(+)) cells. Functional assessments of CD8(+) cells sorted into distinct subsets established that maximal CNAR activity was mediated by CD45RA(-) CCR7(-) CD27(+) and PD-1(+) CD8(+) cells. T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire profiles of CD8(+) cell subsets having strong CNAR activity exhibited increased perturbations in comparison to those of inactive subsets. Together, these studies suggest that CNAR is driven by HIV replication and that this antiviral activity is associated with oligoclonally expanded activated CD8(+) cells expressing PD-1 and having a transitional memory cell phenotype. The findings better describe the identity of CD8(+) cells showing CNAR and should facilitate the evaluation of this important immune response in studies of HIV pathogenesis, resistance to infection, and vaccine development."
Doc No.306,1678,negative/unlabeled,10.432378,Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection and syncytium formation in human cells by V3 loop synthetic peptides from gp120.,"Because V3 loop-specific antibodies have been shown to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of human cells and because specific mutations in the V3 loop render the virus ineffective for infection and syncytium formation, we tested the anti-HIV effects of V3 loop peptides from different HIV-1 strains. We obtained evidence that V3 loop synthetic peptides of 8 to 15 amino acids at nanogram concentrations efficiently blocked HIV-1 IIIB infection of several human T-cell lines and of freshly prepared normal human T cells. More importantly, syncytium formation by three different primary clinical HIV isolates was inhibited by the V3 loop peptide from HIV-1 IIIB at a concentration of 1 micrograms/ml. Concentrations of V3 peptides up to 50 micrograms/ml were not toxic to any of the human cells studied. Additionally, V3 peptides incubated in normal human serum or plasma exhibited biological and physical stability for up to 24 h. Taken together, these results suggest that the V3 loop peptides have medical utility as therapeutic reagents to either prevent HIV-1 infection in humans or reduce the spread of virus infection in HIV-infected individuals. These findings are especially significant because a number of reports in the literature indicate that the V3 loop region in gp120 plays an important role in the initial stages of HIV-1 infection of cells."
Doc No.307,4193,positive/labeled,10.430171,HIV-1 reverse transcriptase drug-resistance mutations in chronically infected individuals receiving or naïve to HAART in Cameroon.,"The most common first-line, highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) received by individuals infected with HIV-1 in Cameroon is the combination therapy Triomune, comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI). To examine the efficacy of these drugs in Cameroon, where diverse non-B HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses predominate, the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral sequences in patient plasma were analyzed for the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance. Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon."
Doc No.308,9176,positive/labeled,10.42647,Correlation of Internet Use for Health Care Engagement Purposes and HIV Clinical Outcomes Among HIV-Positive Individuals Using Online Social Media.,"The authors aimed to describe cell phone and Internet use and assess the correlation of Internet use for health care engagement purposes and HIV clinical outcomes among HIV-positive individuals. The authors conducted a national survey using online social media to examine cell phone and Internet use, self-reported HIV viral load (detectable vs. undetectable), and antiretroviral adherence rating (excellent vs. less than excellent). Participants (N = 1,494) were asked about their Internet use for health care engagement purposes (including e-mailing health care providers, refilling medications online, and making medical appointments online). Approximately 95% of participants accessed the Internet nearly daily or daily in the past month (mean hours on Internet use per day = 5.2) and 55.5% used the Internet for health care engagement purposes. Those who used the Internet for any health care engagement purposes had a 1.52-fold odds of reporting an undetectable viral load (p = .009) and a 1.49-fold odds of reporting excellent adherence (p = .001). Although Internet access and use were similar across racial/ethnic, educational, and socioeconomic groups, disparities existed with the use of the Internet for health care engagement purposes among racial/ethnic minorities, those with low to moderate financial stability, lower education, and history of incarceration. The authors' data reveal that among HIV-positive users of online social media, use of the Internet for health care engagement purposes is associated with better self-reported virologic and adherence outcomes."

Antiviral agents other than antiretrovirals: therapy for herpesvirus infections, viral hepatitis, and influenza.","The incidences of viral infectious diseases are increasing at an alarming rate in the US and worldwide. Antiviral therapy is challenging because viruses subsume normal host cellular mechanisms for many functions, have rapid replication rates, have poor error scanning when reading genetic code, and undergo frequent drug target mutations. This article will focus on antiviral drugs and principles of treatment for infections due to herpes simplex viruses (HSV1 and HSV2), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, and influenza virus. Therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection will be discussed in the next symposium segment."
Doc No.310,5219,negative/unlabeled,10.423006,The use of human immunodeficiency virus resistance tests in clinical practice.,"Important progress has been made in recent years in the development and clinical use of drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Nevertheless, when antiretroviral therapy fails to be fully suppressive, new viral variants emerge, thus allowing HIV-1 to escape from drug pressure by accumulating mutations. Between 50% and 70% of treated patients with virological rebound harbour some form of drug-resistant virus; transmitted drug resistance in drug-naïve populations has reached 5-20% in areas of the world with access to treatment. The emergence of drug-resistant viruses remains the limiting factor in HIV-1 management, being a major cause of treatment failure, and being associated with clinical progression and death. All international guidelines focus on the importance of tailoring antiretroviral therapy to the individual patient, on the basis onf HIV-1 genetic data, integrated with clinical, laboratory and therapeutic information. The aim of this review is to provide useful information to clinicians and virologists about how and when to use genotypic resistance testing in clinical practice, especially in the management of the first stages of HIV-1 patient care and treatment decisions."
Doc No.311,8659,positive/labeled,10.421987,Socioeconomic and clinical factors explaining the risk of unstructured antiretroviral therapy interruptions among Kenyan adult patients.,"A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the extent of unstructured HIV treatment interruptions (TIs) and investigate the effects of socioeconomic, socio-demographic, HIV treatment-related and clinical factors on the magnitude and rate of the same among adult patients at a Kenyan regional referral center. Four hundred and twenty-one adult patients actively receiving antiretroviral therapy at Nyeri County Referral Hospital since 2003 were randomly selected to complete a health survey questionnaire. Electronic records were used to obtain their HIV treatment utilization history. The marginal effects of selected determinants on prevalence and rate of TI were assessed by fitting multiple Poisson log-linear regression models. In total, 392 patients participated in the study. HIV TI was prevalent with 64.5% having had at least one TI of 3 months or more during treatment. The risk of TI was significantly higher in those longer on treatment (prevalence ratio = 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.28). Greater risk of TI was also associated with lower income (prevalence rate ratio [PRR] = 0.9, 95% CI 0.83-1.00), low medication adherence (PRR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.13-0.72), inconsistent treatment engagement (PRR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.19-0.75) and, contrarily, fewer adverse drug reactions (PRR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.90-0.97). Unstructured HIV TIs appear to be fairly common at the study site. The results suggest that efforts to minimize HIV TI could benefit from treatment-continuity monitoring strategies that target the high-risk sub-samples identified."
Doc No.312,3305,negative/unlabeled,10.410029,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 group m protease in cameroon: genetic diversity and protease inhibitor mutational features.,"To establish a baseline for monitoring resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs) and examining the efficacy of their use among persons in Cameroon infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), we analyzed genetic variability and PI resistance-associated substitutions in PCR-amplified protease (PR) sequences in strains isolated from 110 HIV-1-infected, drug-naïve Cameroonians. Of the 110 strains, 85 were classified into six HIV-1 PR subtypes, A (n = 1), B (n = 1), F (n = 4), G (n = 7), H (n = 1), and J (n = 7), and a circulating recombinant form, CRF02-AG (n = 64). PR genes from the remaining 25 (23%) specimens were unclassifiable, whereas 2% (7 of 301) unclassifiable PR sequences were reported for a global collection. Two major PI resistance-associated mutations, 20M and 24I, were detected in strains from only two specimens, whereas secondary mutations were found in strains from all samples except one strain of subtype B and two strains of CRF02-AG. The secondary mutations showed the typical PI resistance-associated pattern for non-subtype B viruses in both classifiable and unclassifiable PR genes, with 36I being the predominant (99%) mutation, followed by 63P (18%), 20R (15%), 77I (13%), and 10I or 10V (11%). Of these mutations, dual and triple PI resistance-associated substitutions were found in 38% of all the Cameroonian strains. Compared with classifiable PR sequences, unclassifiable sequences had significantly more dual and triple substitutions (64% versus 30%; P = 0.004). Phenotypic and clinical evaluations are needed to estimate whether PI resistance during antiretroviral drug treatment occurs more rapidly in individuals infected with HIV-1 strains harboring multiple PI resistance-associated substitutions. This information may be important for determination of appropriate drug therapies for HIV-1-infected persons in Cameroon, where more than one-third of HIV-1 strains were found to carry dual and triple minor PI resistance-associated mutations."
Doc No.313,9402,positive/labeled,10.400771,Persistence of transmitted drug resistance among subjects with primary human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"Following interruption of antiretroviral therapy among individuals with acquired drug resistance, preexisting drug-sensitive virus emerges relatively rapidly. In contrast, wild-type virus is not archived in individuals infected with drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and thus cannot emerge rapidly in the absence of selective drug pressure. Fourteen recently HIV-infected patients with transmitted drug-resistant virus were followed for a median of 2.1 years after the estimated date of infection (EDI) without receiving antiretroviral therapy. HIV drug resistance and pol replication capacity (RC) in longitudinal plasma samples were assayed. Resistance mutations were characterized as pure populations or mixtures. The mean time to first detection of a mixture of wild-type and drug-resistant viruses was 96 weeks (1.8 years) (95% confidence interval, 48 to 192 weeks) after the EDI. The median time to loss of detectable drug resistance using population-based assays ranged from 4.1 years (conservative estimate) to longer than the lifetime of the individual (less conservative estimate). The transmission of drug-resistant virus was not associated with virus with reduced RC. Sexual transmission of HIV selects for highly fit drug-resistant variants that persist for years. The prolonged persistence of transmitted drug resistance strongly supports the routine use of HIV resistance genotyping for all newly diagnosed individuals."
Doc No.314,554,negative/unlabeled,10.388919,Different hepatitis B virus genotypes are associated with different mutations in the core promoter and precore regions during hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion.,"Mutations in the core promoter and precore regions are frequently found in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative patients, but precore stop codon mutation is restricted to hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes that have T at nucleotide 1858. The aims of this study were to determine the role of core promoter and/or precore mutations in HBeAg seroconversion and their impact on the subsequent course of liver disease, and to determine if core promoter mutations are more frequently selected in patients with HBV genotypes that preclude the development of precore stop codon mutation. Serial sera from 45 patients with chronic HBV infection were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified, and the HBV core promoter and precore regions were sequenced. Ninety-two percent of patients had core promoter or precore mutations after HBeAg seroconversion: 42% had core promoter changes only, 38% had precore stop codon mutations only, and 12% had changes in both regions. Seventy-three percent of the patients had persistently normal aminotransferases, and only 8% had multiple flares in aminotransferases after HBeAg seroconversion. Core promoter changes were significantly more common in patients infected with HBV who have C at nucleotide 1858 (91% vs. 27%; P <.01), while precore stop codon changes were exclusively found in patients infected with HBV who have T at nucleotide 1858 (87% vs. 0; P <.01). The vast majority of our patients had core promoter and/or precore mutations after HBeAg seroconversion. Nevertheless, most patients had sustained remission of liver disease. Our data suggest that core promoter changes are preferentially selected in patients infected with HBV genotypes that preclude the development of precore stop codon mutation."

People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) can experience multiple physical symptoms or problems related to HIV infection and treatment. A common problem for PLWHA continues to be diarrhea and nausea and vomiting (NV). Diarrhea and NV can negatively impact the quality of life and adherence to medication therapy among PLWHA and are common reasons to change or discontinue HAART regimens. Because diarrhea and NV can have substantial negative health outcomes for PLWHA, it is important to understand the causes of these conditions."

Participants rated the program highly on measures of satisfaction, providing evidence of its acceptability. The effectiveness of the program was assessed in comparisons of the intervention (n = 41) and standard care only (n = 40) groups at baseline and 6-week intervals. Program participants showed significant improvement over comparison group participants on measures of HIV/AIDS and treatment-related knowledge and recognition and understanding of HIV terms. Although there were no significant changes in adherence mastery and behaviors during the 6-week follow up period, there were significant changes in program participants' knowledge about medication adherence. Future steps to examine the sustainability of the program in the medical management of patients are planned in addition to determining its long-range relative impact."
Doc No.317,8828,positive/labeled,10.379524,Meningioma in four patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"We describe four patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had development of meningiomas. In contrast to those in the general population who have meningiomas, all our patients were young men; the mean age was 40 years (range, 32 to 50). Their risk behavior for HIV was homosexuality (three patients) and intravenous drug use (one patient). The CD4+ cell count in each of the three homosexual men was less than 50/microL and was 280/microL in the drug user. Imaging studies showed enhancing lesions in three of the patients. Although each of these meningiomas could have occurred in otherwise normal young to middle-aged men, we speculate that the meningiomas may have grown in these HIV-infected hosts because of either loss of immune function or dysregulation of cytokines."
Doc No.318,6542,negative/unlabeled,10.376239,Immune escape mutations detected within HIV-1 epitopes associated with viral control during treatment interruption.,"We analyzed immune responses in chronically HIV-infected individuals who took part in a treatment interruption (TI) trial designed for patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy within 6 months of seroconversion. In the 2 subjects who exhibited the best viral control, we detected CD8(+) T-cell responses against 1-2 Gag epitopes during the early weeks of TI and a subsequent increase in the number of epitopes recognized by the later time points. Each of these subjects developed mutations within the epitopes targeted by the highest magnitude responses. In the subject with the worst viral control, we detected responses against 2 Gag epitopes throughout the entire TI and no Gag mutations. The magnitude of these responses increased dramatically with time, greatly exceeding those detected in the virologic controllers. The highest levels of contemporaneous autologous neutralizing antibody activity were detected in the virologic controllers, and a subsequent escape mutation developed within the envelope gene of one controller that abrogated the response. These data suggest that immune escape mutations are a sign of viral control during TI, and that the absence of immune escape mutations in the presence of high levels of viral replication indicates the lack of an effective host immune response."
Doc No.319,7590,negative/unlabeled,10.3717165,Long-term postpartum adherence to antiretroviral drugs among women in Latin America.,"Antiretroviral adherence in the postpartum period is crucial for maternal health and decreasing the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission and transmission to sexual partners. Self-reported antiretroviral adherence was examined between 6- to 12-weeks and 30 months postpartum among 270 HIV-infected women enrolled in a prospective cohort study from 2008 to 2010 at multiple sites in Latin America. Adherence data were collected at each study visit to quantify the proportion of prescribed antiretrovirals taken during the previous three days, assess the timing of the last missed dose, and identify predictors of adherence. Mean adherence rates were 89.5% at 6-12 weeks and 92.4% at 30 months; the proportions with perfect adherence were 80.3% and 83.6%, respectively. The overall trend for perfect adherence was not significant (p = 0.71). In adjusted regression modelling, younger age was associated with an increased probability of non-perfect adherence at 18 and 24 months postpartum. Other factors associated with increased probability of non-perfect adherence were higher parity, current use of alcohol and tobacco, and more advanced HIV disease. Women with perfect adherence had lower viral loads. Interventions for alcohol and tobacco use cessation, and support for young women and those with advanced HIV disease should be considered to improve postpartum adherence."

Clearance of genital HR-HPV infection was evaluated for 134 HIV-1 seropositive African-American female adolescents from the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) cohort. Genotyping targeted 225 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the exons, 5' untranslated region (UTR) and 3' UTR sequences of 27 immune-related candidate genes encoding interleukin family of cytokines. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the association of type-specific HPV clearance adjusting for time-varying CD4+ T-cell count and low-risk (LR-HPV) HPV co-infections. HR-HPV clearance rates were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with five SNPs (rs228942, rs419598, rs315950, rs7737000, and rs9292618) mapped to coding and regulatory regions in three genes (IL2RB, IL1RN, and IL7R). These data suggest that the analyzed genetic variants in interleukin family of cytokines modulate HR-HPV clearance in HIV-1 seropositive African-Americans that warrants replication."

Doc No.322,1957,positive/labeled,10.354823,Indicators of adherence to antiretroviral therapy treatment among HIV/AIDS patients in 5 African countries.,"As the HIV epidemic threatens the social fabric of countries struggling with HIV prevalence rates as high as 10% to 30%, access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone is only the beginning of the clinical challenge. There is a need to identify adherence indicators that will ensure long-term treatment success. A cross-sectional review of 921 adult patients on ART for at least 1 year was conducted. Through an administered adherence survey, key indicators were found to be highly correlated with patient adherence. The adherence rate in this sample was 72% after being on treatment for an average of 15 months. This data suggest that having a high perceived quality of care and owning one's own home positively affected patients' adherence. Indicators such as alcohol use in the last month and a high level of depression negatively affected patients' adherence. Targeting specific indicators for specific interventions will guard against nonadherence, leading to treatment failure."
Doc No.323,1895,negative/unlabeled,10.353213,Increased number of single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions correlates with HIV-1 antigen expression and CD4+ cell decline in vivo.,"Human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) DNA in peripheral blood cells of HIV-1 infected individuals may be present as integrated and/or unintegrated DNA. Several reports have indicated that a major proportion of HIV-1 DNA in the asymptomatic phase is linear, full-length, and unintegrated and in the symptomatic phase either circular unintegrated or integrated in the host genome. We developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to detect single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions, reflecting the presence of unintegrated single-LTR circles. In vitro infection of a CD4+ T-cell line resulted first in the increase of single-LTR junctions followed by syncytium formation and a rise of p24 antigen production. The number of single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions was further studied in two acutely infected individuals and in 21 long-term infected individuals. The number of single-LTR junctions was significantly correlated with CD4+ cell decline, p24 antigen expression, and total HIV-1 DNA content of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions were absent from PBMC containing other forms of HIV-1 DNA in four of nine non/slow progressors relative to 2 of 12 rapid progressors/AIDS patients. We conclude from our data that quantitative detection of single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions can be used as an early DNA marker of the transition from clinical latency to active replication in the peripheral blood."

Here, an investigation was done to determine whether cellular immunity to EBV is lost because of physical loss or dysfunction of EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells. Data on EBV-specific cellular immunity were correlated with EBV load. For comparison, individuals who progressed to AIDS with opportunistic infections (AIDS-OI) and long-term asymptomatics (LTAs) were studied. The number of virus-specific T cells was detected using tetrameric HLA-EBV-peptide complexes; function of these EBV-specific T cells was determined using the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) Elispot assay. It was observed that EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells were present in normal numbers in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. However, their functional capacity was decreased compared with HIV(-) individuals. In AIDS-NHL patients, EBV-specific T cells were not physically lost in the course of HIV-1 infection but showed progressive loss of their capability to produce IFN-gamma in response to EBV peptides. This loss of function correlated with lower CD4(+) T-cell numbers and was accompanied by increasing EBV load. In HIV-1-infected LTA individuals, in whom CD4(+) T-cell numbers were maintained, and progressors to AIDS-OI, IFN-gamma-producing EBV-specific T cells were stable and EBV load remained stable or decreased in the course of HIV infection, suggestive of immune control. Our data indicate that functional loss of EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells with a concomitant increase in EBV load may play a role in the pathogenesis of AIDS-NHL."
Doc No.325,4401,negative/unlabeled,10.310381,Evaluating the Role of Cellular Immune Responses in the Emergence of HCV NS3 Resistance Mutations During Protease Inhibitor Therapy.,"The efficacy of protease inhibitor drugs in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment is limited by the selection and expansion of drug-resistant mutations. HCV replication is error-prone and genetic variability within the dominant epitopes ensures its persistence. The aims of this study are to evaluate the role of cellular immune response in the emergence of HCV protease resistance mutations and its effects on treatment outcome. Ten chronically HCV-infected subjects were treated with boceprevir (BOC)-based triple therapy. HCV-RNA was tested for BOC resistance-associated viral variants. HCV protease resistance mutations were investigated pretreatment and 24 weeks post-treatment. Synthetic peptides representing the wild-type and the potential nonstructural (NS)3 variants were used to evaluate T cell responses and human leukocyte antigen binding. Sustained viral response was achieved in 70% of patients, two patients were treatment nonresponders (NRs) and one was classified as a relapse. Pretreatment, the proportion of drug-resistant variants within individuals was higher in sustained viral responders (SVRs) than in NR patients. However, resistance-associated variants increased in NRs after BOC combined triple therapy. In contrast to NR patients, significant stronger cell-mediated immune responses were observed at the baseline among those who achieved sustained viral response for all T cell epitopes tested. Despite the increase in cell-mediated immune responses at week 24 in NRs, they failed to control the virus replication, leading to development of overt drug-resistant variants. Our data suggest that strong NS3-specific T cell immune responses at the baseline may predict a positive outcome of directly acting antiviral-based therapy, and the presence of pre-existent resistance mutations does not play a significant role in the outcome of anti-HCV combined therapy."

This is a prospective observational cohort of 700 HIV-infected patients enrolled between March 2004 and June 2006 in four U.S. cities, who completed a confidential audio computer-assisted self-interview [ACASI] with behavioral risk and health-related questions at baseline and 6-month follow-up visits, including the nine-question PRIME-MD depression screener and a validated 3-day antiretroviral adherence question. Among 539 eligible participants receiving HAART, 14% had depression at baseline (22% women, 12% men). In multivariable analysis using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for repeated measurements through 24 months of follow-up, persons who reported depression on a given ACASI were twice as likely to report nonadherence to antiretrovirals on the same ACASI (Odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% CI: 1.15, 3.57] for mild/moderate depression versus none); such persons were also less likely to have HIV viral load<400 copies/mL.

Part 2: Mechanism of the antiviral action.","In the accompanying paper, the resistance to infections with HSV type 1 (HSV-1) and Candida albicans was improved in thermally injured mice treated with benzoylmesaconine (BEN), an aconitine-hydrolysate isolated from heated Aconiti tuber, or inoculated with splenic CD4+ T cells from BEN-treated mice (BEN T cells). In this paper, therefore, the antiviral mechanism of BEN T cells (or BEN) on the improved resistance of burned mice to the HSV-1 infection was studied. Burn-associated CD + CD11b+ TCRgamma/delta+ type-2 T cells have been shown to be a key on the increased susceptibility of thermally injured mice to infection with HSV-1 or C. albicans. The susceptibility of T6S-mice, mice inoculated with 1 x 10(6) cells/mouse of T6S cells (a clone of burn-associated type-2 T cells), to HSV-1 infection was similar to that of thermally injured mice. The adoptive transfer of BEN T cells to T6S-mice restores their impaired resistance to HSV-1 infection. The type-2 cytokine levels in sera of T6S-mice were decreased after inoculation of BEN T cells. BEN T cells inhibited the type-2 cytokine production by T6S cells when they were cocultured in vitro. BEN T cells, characterized as CD4+ CD28+ TCRalpha/beta+ Vicia villosa (VV) lectin-adherent T cells, showed non-specific ability to inhibit the cytokine production by various type-2 T cells. From the results of the cytokine-producing profile, BEN T cells were shown to be a different subset of CD4+ T cells from Th1 and Th2 cells, although these three CD4+ T cells had similar properties phenotypically. BEN T cells were induced in normal mice 1-4 days after the oral treatment of BEN (1 microg/kg or more). These results suggest that, through the induction of antagonistic CD4+ T cells against burn-associated type-2 T cells, BEN may improve the resistance of T6S-mice (or thermally injured mice) to the infection of HSV-1."

Genome-wide association studies consistently linked SVR of IFN-α-based therapy to the IL28B single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 19q.13 in various populations. This study was undertaken to investigate the association of IL28B SNPs with SVR in a cohort of Taiwanese chronic HCV patients. Ten SNPs of IL28B were genotyped in 728 chronic HCV patients and 960 healthy controls. Genotype distributions, allele frequencies and haplotypes were tested for SVR and susceptibility in Taiwanese chronic HCV patients. Non-genotype 1 infection (adjusted P=3.3 × 10(-12), odds ratio (OR) 0.179; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.110-0.290) and low HCV viral load (<400 000 IU ml(-1)) (adjusted P=3.5 × 10(-9), OR 0.299; 95% CI: 0.200-0.446) were two major factors identified for high SVR. Notably, eight IL28B SNPs including previously described disease-associated SNPs (Trend test P=0.005) were significantly associated with SVR. Our data indicate that IL28B polymorphisms are the essential contributing factors for high SVR in Taiwanese chronic HCV patients. Combination of virus genotyping and host genetic data may be used to select the optimal treatment regimes in IFN-based therapy."
Doc No.330,8054,negative/unlabeled,10.289014,Patterns of CD8+ immunodominance may influence the ability of Mamu-B*08-positive macaques to naturally control simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239 replication.,"Certain major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I alleles are strongly associated with control of human immunodeficiency virus and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). CD8(+) T cells specific for epitopes restricted by these molecules may be particularly effective. Understanding how CD8(+) T cells contribute to control of viral replication should yield important insights for vaccine design. We have recently identified an Indian rhesus macaque MHC class I allele, Mamu-B*08, associated with elite control and low plasma viremia after infection with the pathogenic isolate SIVmac239. Here, we infected four Mamu-B*08-positive macaques with SIVmac239 to investigate why some of these macaques control viral replication. Three of the four macaques controlled SIVmac239 replication with plasma virus concentrations below 20,000 viral RNA copies/ml at 20 weeks postinfection; two of four macaques were elite controllers (ECs). Interestingly, two of the four macaques preserved their CD4(+) memory T lymphocytes during peak viremia, and all four recovered their CD4(+) memory T lymphocytes in the chronic phase of infection. Mamu-B*08-restricted CD8(+) T-cell responses dominated the acute phase and accounted for 23.3% to 59.6% of the total SIV-specific immune responses. Additionally, the ECs mounted strong and broad CD8(+) T-cell responses against several epitopes in Vif and Nef. Mamu-B*08-specific CD8(+) T cells accounted for the majority of mutations in the virus at 18 weeks postinfection. Interestingly, patterns of viral variation in Nef differed between the ECs and the other two macaques. Natural containment of AIDS virus replication in Mamu-B*08-positive macaques may, therefore, be related to a combination of immunodominance and viral escape from CD8(+) T-cell responses."

Inter- and intra-subtype polymorphism extends throughout the genome, including the long terminal repeat (LTR). In this study, the importance of the upstream stimulating factor (USF)-binding site (E-box) in the core-negative regulatory element (NRE) of the LTR of HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D, E and G was investigated. In vivo, USF was found to repress transcription directed from representative HIV-1 LTR sequences of all the subtypes tested in an epithelial cell line, yet activate the same transcription in a T-cell line. Mutation of the core-NRE USF site of the representative subtype B LTR did not affect the cell-specific, subtype-independent, dual role of USF. In vitro binding assays showed that recombinant USF(43) interacts with the core-NRE from subtypes B and C, but not A, D, E or G. Thus, USF affects LTR-directed transcription in a cell-specific manner, independently of both the HIV-1 subtype from which the LTR was derived and the core-NRE USF site sequences."
Doc No.333,650,negative/unlabeled,10.252889,Resistance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 to protease inhibitors: selection of resistance mutations in the presence and absence of the drug.,"Inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease are a promising class of antiviral agents that dramatically reduce HIV replication both in culture and in infected patients. However, as for many other antiviral compounds, long-term efficacy of these agents is impeded by the emergence of virus variants with increased resistance to their inhibitory action, following selection of specific mutations in the protease coding sequence. We have studied HIV-1 variants that emerged at different stages of selection in the presence of the C2-symmetrical protease inhibitor ABT-77003. The selection of variants was a gradual process during which mutations accumulated at different sites in the protease, generating virus populations with increasing levels of resistance to the drug. The initially selected viruses had a low level of resistance as well as a markedly reduced replicative capacity. Further accumulation of mutations at secondary sites led to an improvement in both drug resistance and replication. In spite of their reduced infectivity, partially selected virus populations did not readily revert to wild-type when serially passaged in drug-free conditions. Instead, even in the absence of drug, secondary mutations identical to those selected in the presence of the inhibitor continued to emerge. These mutations improved both the intrinsic replicative capacity of the virus and its level of resistance to the inhibitor, suggesting that once committed to drug resistance, readaptation of the enzyme to its natural substrate leads to a reduction of its sensitivity to the inhibitor."

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies that do not require interferon increase response rates to levels identical to those seen in HCV monoinfection. However, drug-drug interaction between antiretrovirals and HCV medication is the major consideration in deciding on the appropriate HCV therapeutic approach in patients with HIV. This article summarizes the currently available data with HCV DAAs in patients with HIV, and focuses on predicting and managing drug interaction to facilitate successful DAA-based HCV therapy in those with HIV.

Doc No.335,7566,negative/unlabeled,10.246496,Maternal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus escape mutations subverts HLA-B57 immunodominance but facilitates viral control in the haploidentical infant.,"Expression of HLA-B57 is associated with restricted replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the mechanism for its protective effect remains unknown. If this advantage depends upon CD8 T-cell recognition of B57-restricted epitopes, mother-to-child transmission of escape mutations within these epitopes could nullify its protective effect. However, if the B57 advantage is largely mediated by selection for fitness-attenuating viral mutations within B57-restricted epitopes, such as T242N in TW10-Gag, then the transmission of such mutations could facilitate viral control in the haploidentical infant. We assessed the consequences of B57-associated mutations on replication capacity, viral control, and clinical outcome after vertical transmission in 13 mother-child pairs. We found that expression of HLA-B57 was associated with exceptional control of HIV during infancy, even when mutations within TW10 and most other B57-restricted epitopes were transmitted, subverting the natural immunodominance of HLA-B57. In contrast, most B57-negative infants born to B57-positive mothers progressed rapidly to AIDS. The presence of T242N led to a reproducible reduction in viral fitness, as demonstrated by in vitro assays using NL4-3 constructs encoding p24 sequences from individual mothers and infants. Associated compensatory mutations within p24-Gag were observed to reverse this impairment and to influence the propensity of T242N to revert after transmission to B57-negative hosts. Moreover, primary failure to control viremia was observed in one infant to whom multiple compensatory mutations were transmitted along with T242N. These parallel in vivo and in vitro data suggest that HLA-B57 confers its advantage primarily by driving and maintaining a fitness-attenuating mutation in p24-Gag."

The serum samples were from individuals known to be infected with variants of HIV-1 including group M subtypes A, B, B', C, D, E, F, and G and group O. All immunoassays detected the vast majority of samples tested. Three samples produced low signal over cutoff values in one or more tests: a clade B sample, an untypeable sample with a low antibody titer, and a group O sample. It is concluded that HIV-1 immunoassays used in the United States are capable of detecting most HIV-1 group M variants."

Three-color flow cytometry was used to quantitate the different CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations in 116 asymptomatic HIV+ individuals. In asymptomatic HIV+ infection there was a significant relative increase in the CD4+ CD45RO+ and CD8+ CD45RO+ T cell subsets, which express CD38 and DR antigens, that correlated strongly with the decline in total CD4+ T cells. In addition, we found a loss of CD4+ CD45RO- and CD8+ CD45RO- T cells associated with progression of HIV infection (as measured by the decline in total CD4+ T cells). Studies presented here also indicate that, with the progression of asymptomatic HIV infection, CD8+ CD11b- T lymphocytes showed a significant decrease, whereas CD8+ CD11b+ T cells were significantly increased. This study demonstrates that the progression of HIV infection in asymptomatic patients involves the increase in CD45RO+ subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the increase in CD8+ CD11b+ T cells, the decrease in CD45RO- CD45RA+ subsets of CD4 and CD8 T cells, and the decline in CD8+ CD11b- T cells."
Doc No.338,7525,negative/unlabeled,10.215964,Repression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 through the novel cooperation of human factors YY1 and LSF.,"A subpopulation of stably infected CD4+ cells capable of producing virus upon stimulation has been identified in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals (T.-W. Chun, D. Finzi, J. Margolick, K. Chadwick, D. Schwartz, and R. F. Siliciano, Nat. Med. 1:1284-1290, 1995). Few host factors that directly limit HIV-1 transcription and could support this state of nonproductive HIV-1 infection have been described. YY1, a widely distributed human transcription factor, is known to inhibit HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transcription and virus production. LSF (also known as LBP-1, UBP, and CP-2) has been shown to repress LTR transcription in vitro, but transient expression of LSF has no effect on LTR activity in vivo. We report that both YY1 and LSF participate in the formation of a complex that recognizes the initiation region of the HIV-1 LTR. Further, we have found that these factors cooperate in the repression of LTR expression and viral replication. This cooperative function may account for the divergent effects of LSF previously observed in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the cooperation of two general cellular transcription factors may allow for the selective downregulation of HIV transcription. Through this mechanism of gene regulation, YY1 and LSF could contribute to the establishment and maintenance of a population of cells stably but nonproductively infected with HIV-1."

We sought to discover whether TE moderated the effect of NCI on adherence to ART in HIV-infected individuals. One hundred sixteen HIV-infected, methadone-maintained people who reported HIV risk behaviors were enrolled in the study. Variables of interest (NCI, ART adherence, TE) were assessed using audio computer-assisted self-interview. Results revealed a significant interactive effect of NCI and TE on ART adherence, which supported the moderation effect. Findings from post hoc analyses showed that NCI was negatively associated with adherence to ART at low levels of TE. Findings suggest the need to accommodate individual NCI and improve TE as a means to enhance ART adherence in HIV-infected PWUDs."
Doc No.340,1832,positive/labeled,10.197326,Short communication: low prevalence of genotypic drug resistance mutations among antiretroviral-naive HIV type 1 patients in Malaysia.,"To assess the prevalence of mutations associated with drug resistance in antiretroviral-naive patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, genotypic resistance testing was conducted among drug-naive HIV-1 patients attending the University Malaya Medical Center (UMMC) between July 2003 and June 2004. Reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes of plasma virions were sequenced from 100 individuals. The majority of the patients were recently diagnosed. Codons 20-255 of the RT and 1-96 of the protease gene were examined for major and minor mutations associated with antiretroviral resistance reported by the International AIDS Society- USA (IAS-USA) Drug Resistance Mutations Group. The prevalence of patients with at least one major mutation conferring drug resistance was 1%, with only one patient having a Y181C amino acid substitution in the RT gene that confers high-level resistance to nevirapine and delavirdine. Minor mutations were detected in high prevalence in the protease gene. Amino acid substitutions I13V, E35D, and M36I were associated with CRF01_AE while L63P, V77I, and I93L were associated with subtype B. Baseline prevalence of major mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs was low among antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 patients, suggesting that routine drug resistance testing may be unnecessary for all individuals newly diagnosed with HIV or all patients beginning antiretroviral therapy."

HIV89.6 is a primary isolate with a transitional phenotype: like M-tropic strains it replicates in primary macrophages and lymphocytes but not in most transformed cells, yet it is also syncytium inducing. We have shown that HIV89.6 can utilize both the M-tropic and T-tropic cofactors CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, in conjunction with CD4 for fusion and entry into otherwise nonpermissive nonhuman cells. To better understand the nature of restricted HIV89.6 infection of transformed cells, we analyzed its interaction with CD4-expressing transformed human HeLaCD4-LTR/beta-Gal cells, which contain the beta-galactosidase gene linked to the HIV-1 LTR. Here we show that HIV89.6 enters these cells and undergoes reverse transcription and integration. Furthermore, HIV89.6 induces LTR-driven beta-galactosidase expression, indicating Tat-dependent trans-activation, in a similar number of cells as the permissive T-tropic/SI isolate HIV(HXB). Acute infection with HIV89.6, however, produces markedly lower levels of p24 antigen and infectious virus per trans-activation-positive cell than HIV(HXB). In contrast, transfection results in high levels of expression for both viruses but HIV89.6 still fails to establish spreading infection. HIV89.6 is also blocked after entry in two other nonpermissive cell lines, SUP-T1 and U937. HIV89.6 arrest in HeLaCD4-LTR/beta-Gal cells at a stage subsequent to entry, reverse transcription, integration, and Tat expression is a novel level at which HIV-1 strain- and cell-specific restrictions define host cell tropism. These studies emphasize that complex patterns of tropism are determined by the interplay of permissive or restricted virus-cell interactions at multiple steps in the replication cycle."
Doc No.342,9743,positive/labeled,10.181106,"Immune activation, CD4+ T cell counts, and viremia exhibit oscillatory patterns over time in patients with highly resistant HIV infection.","The rates of immunologic and clinical progression are lower in patients with drug-resistant HIV compared to wild-type HIV. This difference is not fully explained by viral load. It has been argued that reductions in T cell activation and/or viral fitness might result in preserved target cells and an altered relationship between the level of viremia and the rate of CD4+ T cell loss. We tested this hypothesis over time in a cohort of patients with highly resistant HIV. Fifty-four antiretroviral-treated patients with multi-drug resistant HIV and detectable plasma HIV RNA were followed longitudinally. CD4+ T cell counts and HIV RNA levels were measured every 4 weeks and T cell activation (CD38/HLA-DR) was measured every 16 weeks. We found that the levels of CD4+ T cell activation over time were a strong independent predictor of CD4+ T cell counts while CD8+ T cell activation was more strongly associated with viremia. Using spectral analysis, we found strong evidence for oscillatory (or cyclic) behavior in CD4+ T cell counts, HIV RNA levels, and T cell activation. Each of the cell populations exhibited an oscillatory behavior with similar frequencies. Collectively, these data suggest that there may be a mechanistic link between T cell activation, CD4+ T cell counts, and viremia and lends support for the hypothesis of altered predator-prey dynamics as a possible explanation of the stability of CD4+ T cell counts in the presence of sustained multi-drug resistant viremia."

We investigated this relationship by applying 3 different statistical methods-cluster analysis, recursive partitioning, and linear discriminant analysis-to results for 72 patients followed in the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) protocol 333. ACTG 333 was a multicenter, randomized trial comparing 2 formulations of saquinavir (SQV) to indinavir (IDV) in patients with extensive hard-gel SQV experience. Data include protease amino acid sequences and 50% inhibitory concentrations for SQV and IDV at baseline. The 3 methods give similar results showing the association of mutations at codons 10, 63, 71, and 90 with in vitro resistance to IDV and SQV. Recursive partitioning is especially useful because it can identify interactions among mutations at different codons and accommodates many types of data as well as missing observations."

We evaluated the evolution of drug costs for HIV-infected persons who attend a university clinic in Baltimore, Maryland. Cross-sectional abstracts of a cohort of patients for four periods, corresponding to landmark changes in therapy, who attended the clinic between June 1995 and September 1996 were obtained. Monthly medication costs for all patients were calculated. Mean costs increased significantly (p < .01) from period 1 ($447 U.S.) to period 4 ($1048 U.S.). Multivariate analysis only revealed higher costs for patients with a CD4+ count <200 cells/mm3 (p < .001). The proportion of costs attributable to antiretroviral therapy increased from 34% in period 1 to 53% in period 4. Combination therapy increased >10-fold, from 8% in period 1 to 94% in period 4. Protease inhibitor use also increased significantly, from 4% in period 2 to 53% in period 4. We quantified the increase in costs of medications from mid-1995 to late 1996. Increases in costs appear to be the result of increasing complexity of drug regimens, particularly antiretroviral therapy in combinations."
Doc No.345,7533,positive/labeled,10.158543,Adherence and plasma HIV RNA response to antiretroviral therapy among HIV-seropositive injection drug users in a Canadian setting.,"HIV-positive individuals who use injection drugs (IDU) may have lower rates of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, previous studies of factors associated with adherence to ART among IDU have been limited primarily to samples drawn from clinical settings and in areas with financial barriers to healthcare.We evaluated patterns of ART adherence and rates of plasma HIV RNA response among a Canadian cohort of community-recruited IDU. Using data from a community-recruited cohort of antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected IDU, we investigated ART adherence patterns based on prescription refill compliance and factors associated with time to plasma HIV-1 RNA suppression (<500 copies/mL) using Cox proportional hazards regression in a setting with universal health care, including free ART. Between 1996 and 2008, 267 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected IDU initiated ART and had a median of 51 months (inter-quartile range: 17-95 months) of follow-up. Overall, 81 (30.3%) were ≥95% adherent during the first year of HAART and 187 (70.0%) achieved HIV RNA suppression at least once over the study period, for an incidence-density of 34.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.8-39.9) per 100 person-years. The Kaplan-Meier cumulative plasma HIV RNA suppression rates at 12 months after the initiation of ART were 80.8% (95% CI: 71.2-88.7) for adherent and 28.9% (95% CI: 22.8-36.1) for non-adherent participants. While several socio-demographic characteristics and drug-using behaviours were identified as barriers to successful treatment in unadjusted analyses, the factor most strongly associated with time to HIV RNA suppression in multivariate analysis was adherence to ART of at least 95% (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 6.0, 95% CI: 4.2-8.6, p<0.001). These results demonstrate low rates of adherence to ART among a community-recruited cohort of IDU and reinforce the importance of adherence as the key determinant of successful virological response to antiretroviral therapy."
Doc No.346,9509,negative/unlabeled,10.144183,Determination of the minimal amount of Tat activity required for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication.,"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a potent trans-activator of transcription from the viral LTR promoter. Previous mutagenesis studies have identified domains within Tat responsible for binding to its TAR RNA target and for transcriptional activation. The minimal Tat activation domain is composed of the N-terminal 48 residues, and mutational analyses identified a cluster of critical cysteines. The importance of four highly conserved aromatic amino acids within the activation domain has not been thoroughly investigated. We have systematically substituted these aromatic residues (Y26, F32, F38, Y47) of the HIV-1 LAI Tat protein with other aromatic residues (conservative mutation) or alanine (nonconservative mutation). The activity of the mutant Tat constructs was measured in different cell lines by transfection with a LTR-CAT reporter plasmid. The range of transcriptional activities measured for this set of Tat mutants allowed careful assessment of the level of Tat activity required for optimal viral replication. To test this, the mutant Tat genes were introduced into the pLAI infectious molecular clone and tested for their effect on virus replication in a T-cell line. We found that a twofold reduction in Tat activity already affects viral replication, and no virus replication was measured for Tat mutants with less than 15% activity. This strict correlation between Tat activity and viral replication demonstrates the importance of the Tat function to viral fitness. Interestingly, a less pronounced replication defect was observed in primary cell types. This finding may correlate with the frequent detection of proviruses with Tat-inactivating mutations in clinical samples."

The role of T cell-mediated immunity is suggested by the chronic disease observed in AIDS patients and in athymic or CD4+ T cell-depleted mice. The role of specific antibodies is also unclear. This study sought to determine serum and secretory antibodies to C. parvum in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with or without chronic cryptosporidiosis. C. parvum-specific antibodies and specific secretory antibodies were determined by ELISA in saliva and sera from 50 HIV-1-infected patients, 27 healthy adults, and 21 healthy children. Despite lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts, patients with chronic cryptosporidiosis had increased levels of C. parvum-specific antibodies in saliva and serum and higher specific secretory antibody levels in saliva than did controls. Persistence of protracted diarrhea despite high levels of both serum and secretory antibodies suggests that specific secretory antibodies are not sufficient to control this protozoan parasite infection of intestinal mucosa."
Doc No.348,10011,negative/unlabeled,10.134778,Ligand-independent exhaustion of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor-positive CD8+ T cells in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.,"Virus-specific CD8(+) T cells play a central role in the control of viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. However, despite the presence of strong and broad HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in chronic HIV-1 infection, these cells progressively lose critical effector functions and fail to clear the infection. Mounting evidence suggests that the upregulation of several inhibitory regulatory receptors on the surface of CD8(+) T cells during HIV-1 infection may contribute directly to the impairment of T-cell function. Here, we investigated the role of killer immunoglobulin receptors (KIR), which are expressed on NK cells and on CD8(+) T cells, in regulating CD8(+) T-cell function in HIV-1 infection. KIR expression was progressively upregulated on CD8(+) T cells during HIV-1 infection and correlated with the level of viral replication. Expression of KIR was associated with a profound inhibition of cytokine secretion, degranulation, proliferation, and activation by CD8(+) T cells following stimulation with T-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent stimuli. In contrast, KIR(+) CD8(+) T cells responded potently to TCR-independent stimulation, demonstrating that these cells are functionally competent. KIR-associated suppression of CD8(+) T-cell function was independent of ligand engagement, suggesting that these regulatory receptors may constitutively repress TCR activation. This ligand-independent repression of TCR activation of KIR(+) CD8(+) T cells may represent a significant barrier to therapeutic interventions aimed at improving the quality of the HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell response in infected individuals."

In this study sequential viral isolates were analyzed from five patients with prior zidovudine (AZT) use who received 6 to 16 months of ddl therapy. Following ddl therapy, viral isolates exhibited an increased AZT susceptibility and decreased ddl susceptibility. Sequence and nested PCR analysis of the HIV-1 RT gene revealed that two viral isolates contained the Leu to Val change at codon 74, and three other isolates with reduced susceptibility to ddl each contained changes at codons 65, 70, and 72. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to insert specific mutations in RT gene of proviral clone pNL4-3. Analysis of virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity indicated that the Lys70Arg mutation resulted in an enzyme with 2- to 4-fold decreased susceptibility to ddATP. Statistical analysis of the inhibitory concentration for RT activity between pNL4-3 and mutant Lys70Arg viruses obtained in three independent RT inhibition assays was significant (P = 0.05) by student t test paired analysis. Drug susceptibility assays on the virus with Lys70Arg mutation showed a marginal decrease in susceptibility to ddl (1.5- to 2-fold) and about 4- to 6-fold decrease in susceptibility to AZT. Mutations Lys65Glu and Arg72Ser resulted in an impaired RT with greatly diminished functional RT activity. The AZT-associated Lys70Arg mutation results in an RT enzyme with decreased susceptibility to ddATP."
Doc No.350,4145,negative/unlabeled,10.125379,Synergy between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and Epstein-Barr virus in T lymphoblastoid cell lines.,"CR2 (CD21), the EBV receptor, was detected on three of four CD4-positive cell lines by indirect fluorescent labeling, and its corresponding mRNA was found by use of the reverse transcription-based polymerase chain reaction. To determine whether CR2 on CD4-positive cells was functional, their ability to be infected by EBV was analyzed. EBV DNA, EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2A), and EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER1) transcripts could be detected in CR2-expressing CD4-positive cells following infection by the B95.8 strain of EBV. Analysis of the terminal region showed the EBV genome remained linear following infection, and copy number decreased with time. Since CD4-positive cell lines are targets for HIV-1 infection, the effects of EBV infection on HIV-1 expression were analyzed. HIV-1 replication was upregulated when CD4-positive cells were coinfected with EBV strain B95.8 but not P3HR-1K. These results suggested that EBNA-2 is involved in upregulation of HIV-1 expression in T lymphoblastoid cell lines. To test this hypothesis an EBNA-2-expression vector was transfected into T lymphoblastoid cell lines and HIV-1 expression measured. First, trans-activation of HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by Tat was enhanced by EBNA-2 type 1 expression. trans-Activation of the HIV-1 LTR by Tat was also enhanced when CD4-positive cells were infected by EBV (strain B95.8) encoding an intact EBNA-2, but not by P3HR-1K with a deleted EBNA-2. In addition, CD4-positive cell clones stably expressing EBNA-2 supported enhanced HIV-1 replication as measured by accumulation of reverse transcriptase activity and syncytium induction. This provides direct evidence that EBV infection can enhance HIV-1 replication in T cells. Whether this in vitro phenomenon contributes to disease progression in vivo remains to be determined."
Doc No.351,7380,positive/labeled,10.120404,Engagement in HIV Prevention Advocacy Associated with Increased Consistent Condom Use Among HIV Clients in Uganda.,"We examined whether engagement in prevention advocacy among HIV clients is associated with their own condom use and HIV care adherence. Longitudinal data merged from three studies in Uganda produced a sample of 1,882 participants who were administered assessments at baseline and months 6 and 12. The measure of prevention advocacy was the mean of two Likert scale items assessing encouragement of others to (1) use condoms, and (2) get HIV tested. In regression analyses controlling for demographics and known correlates of the dependent variables, increased prevention advocacy from baseline to month 12 was significantly associated with increased consistent condom use and marginally associated with increased antiretroviral adherence and clinic attendance. These results suggest that empowering HIV clients to engage in prevention advocacy with others may benefit their own HIV protective behaviors and should be promoted as a component to interventions targeting positive living among people living with HIV.

Doc No.352,5215,negative/unlabeled,10.117719,Sensitization of the HIV-1-LTR upon long term low dose oxidative stress.,"Human lymphoid cell lines were transfected with HIV-1-LTR-CAT DNA and permanently transformed cell lines were obtained. These transformed cell lines were treated with 0.01 mM H2O2 for 25 days and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activities of these cell lines were measured. The CAT activities of transformed cell lines were latent in normal culture conditions, but were activated by retreatment with 0.2 mM H2O2 for 1 h. On treatment with 0.05 mM H2O2 for 1 h, the CAT activity of these cell lines maintained in normal conditions remained latent, whereas cell lines pretreated with 0.01 mM H2O2 for 25 days were greatly activated by this treatment. Here, the HIV-1 promoter seemed latent in normal culture conditions, but it could be activated by a comparatively low concentration (0.05 mM) of H2O2 after treatment with a dilute H2O2 (0.01 mM) for about 1 month. Many patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) show a long latent period before development of AIDS. During this latent period, their infected cells may be subjected to oxidative stress due to metabolism and physical movement. The present results indicate that oxidative stress may cause activation of the HIV-1 promoter in patients with latent HIV-1."

Three patients (3.3%) had an M46I amino acid substitution in the protease (PR) gene that decreased susceptibility to IDV, RTV, and NFV and one patient (1.1%) had an M184I amino acid substitution in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene that confers high-level resistance to 3TC and FTC. Minor mutations were detected in high frequency in the PR gene. The frequencies of minor mutations to protease inhibitors (PI) were I93L (71.4%), L63P (62.6%), V77I (62.6%), M36I/V (33.0%), A71T/V (22.0%), K20R (6.6%), G16E (6.6%), and L10I (5.5%). The relatedness between subtypes and the frequencies of amino acid substitutions in PR were observed; 63P, 77I, and 71V/T were found in HIV-1 subtype B'/B, 16E, 36I, 20R/I, and 82I in non-B, except for CRF07_BC, 10I in subtype A, and 93L in non-A. Although the primary resistance of HIV-1 to antiretroviral drugs is low among the treatment-naive HIV-1 patients living in Liaoning province, the surveillance and monitoring of drug-resistant HIV-1 should be implemented regularly because of the increased access to antiretroviral therapy in China."
Doc No.354,7611,negative/unlabeled,10.082981,The relationship of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression to antiretroviral medication adherence in persons with HIV.,"In HIV/AIDS, symptoms of depression or post-traumatic stress may interfere with important self-care behaviors such as the ability to adhere to one's medical treatment regimen. However, these problems may frequently go undetected in HIV care settings. The present study used brief self-report screening measures of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the HIV/AIDS care settings to examine (1) frequency of positive screens for these diagnoses; (2) the degree to which those with a positive screen were prescribed antidepressant treatment; and (3) the association of continuous PTSD and depression symptom scores, and categorical (screening positive or negative) PTSD and depression screening status, to each other and to ART adherence as assessed by the Medication Event Monitoring System, regardless of antidepressant treatment. Participants were 164 HIV-infected individuals who took part in a multisite adherence intervention study in HIV treatment settings in Massachusetts. Available data from 5 time points was used, yielding 444 data points. Participants screened positive for PTSD at 20% of visits, and depression at 22% of visits. At visits when participants screened positive for both depression and PTSD, 53.6% of the time they were on an antidepressant. Those who screened positive for PTSD were more likely to also screen positive for depression. In multiple regression analyses that included both continuous and dichotomous PTSD and depression and controlled for shared variance due to clustering of multiple observations, only depression contributed significant unique variance, suggesting the primary role of depression and the secondary role of PTSD in poor adherence in individuals with HIV."

A strong increase in the expression of CD95 (APO-1/Fas) and CD95 ligand, key regulators of apoptosis in normal T cells, has previously been described in freshly isolated T cells from HIV-1-positive children when compared with healthy age-matched controls. We also found an increase in spontaneous as well as specific CD95-mediated apoptosis in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from these patients. However, the relationship of these findings to disease progression in children with HIV infection is not known. MEASUREMENTS AND SUBJECTS: We studied expression of CD95 and CD95 ligand as well as sensitivity towards spontaneous and anti-CD95-triggered apoptosis of T cells in 33 HIV-1-positive children and adolescents in different disease stages."
Doc No.356,3379,negative/unlabeled,10.076995,Individual and system level factors associated with treatment nonadherence in human immunodeficiency virus-infected men and women.,"Antiretroviral treatment nonadherence is complex, implicating more than a patient's ability and motivation to be compliant. The bulk of the research to date focuses on individual level barriers with less emphasis on the many system level factors that potentially impact patients' adherence behaviors. This study examined the effects of system enabling factors in addition to the frequently studied individual predisposing and enabling factors upon nonadherence to treatment. One hundred eighty-two patients from five community-based clinics were interviewed and their medical charts examined. Patients' self-reported nonadherence was correlated with clinicians' assessments of medication and appointment nonadherence. Seven individual predisposing factors (gender, ethnicity, birthplace, years of education, HIV Overview of Problems-Evaluation System [HOPES] psychosocial, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] anxiety, and HADS depression scores) were found to be significantly associated with treatment adherence/nonadherence. Individual enabling factors (hopefulness and access to health care), as well as treatment by clinic staff, a system enabling factor, were significantly associated with adherence/nonadherence. In a multivariate analysis, six factors - age (younger), gender (female), birth outside the United States, level of hopefulness (lower), access to health care (lower), and treatment by clinic staff (poorer) - accounted for 19.3% of the variance in nonadherence. Results of this study indicated that several individual predisposing and enabling factors were potential predictors of treatment nonadherence; however, system enabling factors, e.g., treatment by clinic staff were also associated with treatment nonadherence. Further studies are needed to examine the complex relationships of individual and system related factors in predicting treatment nonadherence."

The study population consisted of 807 protease inhibitor-naive HIV-seropositive patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy with reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors (indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir) between January 1997 and January 1999. Demographic variable, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+ T-cell count, adverse drug reactions, and adherence to HAART were assessed. Virologic treatment response was defined as a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA load from baseline to below 500 copies per milliliter after 12 months of therapy. Levels of HIV-1 RNA were undetectable in 43% of patients at 12 months. Factors associated with failure to suppress viral load included age 40 years or younger, baseline CD4+ T cell count less than 200 x 10(6) per liter baseline viral load greater than 4.3 log(10) per milliliter, and non-adherence to HAART. After adjustment by logistic regression, non-adherence was the only statistically significant variable associated with virologic failure (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.67). Unselected patients in whom protease inhibitor is started in a usual clinical setting achieve viral suppression less frequently than do patients in controlled clinical trials. Failure to adherence to HAART was the strongest predictor of virologic failure."

CTL clones were derived from peripheral blood or cerebrospinal fluid of three HIV-1 patients, with depressed CD4+ T cell counts. When stimulated with HLA-compatible target cells (B-LCL) presensitized with cognate HIV-1 peptides, all clones produced GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma and most produced low amounts of IL2, IL3, and IL4. After nonspecific stimulation with a phorbol ester and calcium ionophore, the clones secreted cytokines at levels similar to those from CD4+ lines from an HIV-1 infected donor. The ability of supernatants from the stimulated CTL clones to support the formation of granulocyte-macrophage colonies in normal bone marrow suggests that the GM-CSF was biologically active. Release of cytokines by activated CTL may influence the immunopathogenesis of HIV disease."
Doc No.359,9219,negative/unlabeled,10.050376,Natural variants of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat: analysis of promoters with duplicated DNA regulatory motifs.,"Sequence variation in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region of HIV-1 was analyzed in viral isolates of 17 infected individuals. Two classes of LTR size variants were found. One HIV-1 variant was detected containing an additional binding site for the transcription factor Sp1. Another LTR size variation was observed in four patients in a region just upstream of the NF-kappa B enhancer. This variation was the result of a duplication of a short DNA sequence (CTG-motif). Cell culture experiments demonstrated that the natural variant with four Sp1 sites had a slightly higher promoter activity and viral replication rate than the isogenic control LTR with three Sp1 sites. No positive effect of the duplicated CTG-motif could be detected. In order to measure small differences in virus production more accurately, equal amounts of a size variant and the wild-type plasmid were cotransfected into T-cells. The virus with four Sp1 sites did outgrow the three Sp1 virus in 35 days of culture and CTG-monomer virus outcompeted the CTG-dimer virus in 42 days. Based on these results we estimate a 5-10% difference in virus production of the LTR variants when compared to that of wild-type."

We report the case of a 42-year-old man who entered care with a CD4+ cell count of 78/microL but was reluctant to take many of the available antiretroviral agents. For many years, periods of sobriety and good adherence to antiretroviral medications were interspersed with relapses to heroin, cocaine, and alcohol use as well as episodes of overdose, major depression with psychiatric hospitalization, incarceration, and discontinuation of antiretroviral medications. After 4 years of HIV primary care, the patient was stabilized to begin therapy for hepatitis C with pegylated interferon and ribavirin with the support of a multidisciplinary team. After starting treatment for hepatitis C, the patient achieved an early virologic response and continues to have an undetectable HCV RNA level by polymerase chain reaction testing and 100% adherence to on-site pegylated interferon injections, without adverse events related to his addiction or psychiatric symptoms. This case suggests that HIV-HCV-coinfected persons with the common comorbidities of polysubstance dependence and psychiatric illness may effectively and safely undergo pharmacotherapy for hepatitis C with appropriate support."
Doc No.361,1174,negative/unlabeled,10.045449,In vitro analysis of the effects of mutations in the G-tract of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 polypurine tract on RNase H cleavage specificity.,"The recognition and precise cleavage of the polypurine tract (PPT) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is an essential step in HIV-1 reverse transcription. The accurate cleavage, and the subsequent removal, of the PPT by the RNase H activity of HIV-1 RT defines the left end of the double-stranded viral DNA genome, the substrate for integration into the host genome. Previous analyses have shown that mutations in the 3'-end (G-tract) of the PPT cause alterations in RNase H cleavage specificity. In particular, mutations at positions 2 and 5 in the G-tract increased the frequency of retention of PPT sequences in the 2-LTR circle junction. To better understand why these mutations affected PPT cleavage in vivo, we analyzed the cleavage of PPT substrates in vitro that contained altered sequences and unusual base substitutions. Our results, herein, confirm that mutations at positions 2 and 5 of the G-tract do significantly alter the cleavage specificity at the PPT/U3 junction, and further suggest that the miscleavages observed in vivo were due to an improper generation of the PPT primer, as opposed to its improper removal. Finally, our results point to the structure of the PPT, rather than the base-specific contacts between the PPT and HIV-1 RT, as the primary determinants of RNase H cleavage specificity at the PPT/U3 junction."

However, the main problem with prolonged use of lamivudine is the development of viral resistance to the treatment. Mutations in the YMDD motif of the hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase gene have been associated with resistance to drug therapy. So far, there have not been many studies in Brazil reporting on genotype-dependent development of resistance to lamivudine. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the possible correlation between a certain genotype and increased development of resistance to lamivudine among chronic hepatitis B patients."
Doc No.363,4172,negative/unlabeled,10.03475,The association of hepatitis C viral infection with porphyria cutanea tarda in the Lothian region of Scotland.,"Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is believed to be associated with reduced hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity and risk factors such as alcohol abuse and medication with oral contraceptives and certain other drugs. Recently it has been suggested that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may also be associated with PCT. We have therefore reviewed the prevalence of HCV infection in a series of patients with PCT in the Lothian region of Scotland. We identified 12 patients with PCT, all of whom had abnormal liver function tests. Liver histology revealed chronic active hepatitis in six patients, micronodular cirrhosis in four patients, hepatocellular carcinoma in one patient and normal findings in one HIV positive patient. Out of 12 patients tested, 11 were positive for anti-HCV antibodies by second generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA 2), and by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA 2); positive serology was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In a second group of 14 patients with chronic HCV infection matched for age and sex with the PCT patients, all had normal urinary uroporphyrin excretion. We have thus confirmed in Scotland early reports from Spain and Italy that PCT is strongly associated with HCV infection. This could explain the development of inflammatory changes in the liver and progression of liver disease in patients with PCT. Porphyrin metabolism, however, appears normal in patients with chronic HCV infection without PCT."
Doc No.364,7413,positive/labeled,10.031419,2B4 expression on natural killer cells increases in HIV-1 infected patients followed prospectively during highly active antiretroviral therapy.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection influences natural killer (NK) cell expression of inhibitory NK receptors and activating natural cytotoxicity receptors. It is unknown whether expression of the co-stimulatory NK cell receptor 2B4 (CD244) on NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells are affected by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), low-level viraemia, proviral-DNA or immune activation in HIV-1 infected patients. A total of 101 HAART-treated HIV-1 infected patients with < or = 200 HIV-RNA copies/ml were followed prospectively for 24 months. HIV-RNA was investigated 3-monthly and 2B4 expression on CD3- CD16+ NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells, proviral-DNA and plasma soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor (sTNFr)-II were investigated 6-monthly. For comparison, 2B4 expression was investigated in 20 healthy individuals. The concentration of 2B4+ NK cells was initially reduced in HIV-1 infected patients (P < 0.001) but increased to a normal level during the 24 months' follow-up. The concentration of CD3+ CD8+ 2B4+ cells in HIV-1 infected patients was normal and did not change during follow-up. The relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of 2B4 increased on both NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells during follow-up (both P < 0.001). Higher levels of proviral-DNA carrying cells and plasma sTNFrII were associated with reductions in the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells (all P < 0.05). HIV-RNA had no effect on 2B4 expression on NK cells or CD3+ CD8+ cells. These findings demonstrate that the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells normalizes during long-term HAART in HIV-1 infected patients. The finding that proviral-DNA and sTNFrII were associated negatively with the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells suggests that immune activation in HIV-1 infected patients receiving HAART influences the target cell recognition by NK cells."

Doc No.366,4890,negative/unlabeled,10.027541,Prevalence of HIV drug resistance mutation in the northern Indian population after failure of the first line antiretroviral therapy.,"There is limited information available about the prevalence and pattern of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance mutations (DRMs) among antiretroviral therapy (ART) experienced patients from northern India. Results of genotypic drug resistance testing were obtained from plasma samples of 128 patients, who had presented with clinical or immunological failure to treatment after at least six months of ART. Major DRMs associated with any of the three classes of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI), were seen in 120 out of 128 patients (93.8% prevalence). NRTI and NNRTI DRMs were each seen in 115/128 (89.8%) patients, with M184V, M41L, D67N and T215Y being the most frequent among NRTI associated mutations, and K103N, G190A, Y181C and A98G among NNRTI associated ones. PI DRMs were observed in 14/128 (10.9%) patients, with L10I, V82A and L89V being the commonest. These results present a high prevalence of DRMs among ART experienced patients from northern India with clinical or immunological failure of therapy. It emphasizes the need for regular testing of plasma samples of such patients for DRMs in order to detect and replace a failing regimen early, and also the use of HIV drug resistance genotyping of ART naive individuals prior to initiating first line ART for possible transmitted resistance. It is very important to enhance the access of patients to ARV drugs so that their compliance could be improved and hence development of DRMs be minimized."
Doc No.367,5992,negative/unlabeled,10.026316,Chronic inflammation in a long-term cohort of HIV-infected patients according to the normalization of the CD4:CD8 ratio.,"In HIV-infected patients a low CD4:CD8 ratio can persist despite CD4 recovery with long-term antiretroviral treatment (ART). As CD4:CD8 inversion is considered a marker of immune-senescence, we aimed to assess if it was associated with the chronic inflammation state in aging patients with HIV. A total of 112 patients with a >15 year history of HIV infection and ART were included, 85 of whom were suppressed. All subjects were tested for interleukin (IL)-6, high-sensitivity (hs)-PCR, and D-dimer levels. Complete clinical, therapeutic, and hematochemical data were retrieved. Coreceptor tropism based on HIV-DNA gp120 genotyping was also available within the past 6 months. A progressive increase in the CD4:CD8 ratio over time was observed without reaching a plateau. Based on the CD4:CD8 ratio at the time of testing, patients were classified into group A (normal ratio ≥0.9) and group B (<0.9). A normal ratio was observed in 37% of patients. Variables associated with an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio were older age, nadir CD4, and detectable HIV viremia. No association between HIV subtype, coreceptor tropism, cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfections and CD4:CD8 ratio was observed. Group B patients showed a trend for a higher frequency of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia compared to group A patients, but they did not differ in IL-6, hs-PCR, and D-dimer levels or in frequency of severe non-AIDS-associated events. In conclusion, CD4:CD8 ratio normalization occurs rarely, even after several years of ART. Chronic inflammation in patients aging with HIV does not seem to be directly dependent on the CD4:CD8 ratio. However, the persistent immune dysregulation expressed by a CD4:CD8 inversion might be linked to a higher risk of non-AIDS events, especially metabolic disorders."
Doc No.368,2577,negative/unlabeled,10.02242,Lack of effect of motivation on the adherence of HIV-positive/AIDS patients to antiretroviral treatment.,"As a result of the potent drug combinations of reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors currently available, it is now possible to achieve extreme reductions in the numbers of viral particles in the peripheral blood of HIV-positive patients undergoing treatment, to the point that they are undetectable. Moreover, the immunological recovery resulting from continued and prolonged use of these drugs significantly reduces both mortality and the incidence of opportunistic infections. However, the strict therapeutic regimens required, the number of pills, adverse events and the stigma of a disease that requires the patient to introduce pill-taking into his/her lifestyle brings into question one aspect of mental health, which is motivation to do that which is being proposed. We investigated the influence of each of the components of the adherence trilogy: information, motivation and behavioral abilities, as risk factors in a population of HIV-positive/AIDS patients undergoing antiretroviral treatment in the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil."

Using qualitative data, this paper identifies potential lay social resources for support of PrEP adherence by HIV serodiscordant couples in Uganda, laying the groundwork for incorporation of these resources into adherence support initiatives as part of implementation. The qualitative analysis characterizes support for PrEP adherence provided by HIV-infected spouses, children, extended family members, and the larger community. Results suggest social resources for support of PrEP adherence in Africa are plentiful outside formal health care settings and health systems and that couples will readily use them. The same shortage of health professionals that impeded scale-up of antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS in Africa promises to challenge delivery of PrEP. Building on the treatment scale-up experience, implementers can address this challenge by examining the value of lay social resources for adherence support in developing strategies for delivery of PrEP."

We examined antiretroviral resistance among a cohort of 323 South African HIV-infected children <2 years old exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Ritonavir (RTV) was used initially for 138 children who were <6 months old or receiving antimycobacterial therapy; otherwise children received lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based ART. HIV-1 population sequencing of the pol gene was conducted on all pretreatment samples and on posttreatment samples for children who did not achieve HIV-1 plasma RNA <400 copies/ml by 52 weeks. Among children in the cohort, 38 died, 22 had <24 weeks follow-up, 209 achieved virologic suppression, and 54 did not. Of 41 children without virologic suppression with posttreatment HIV genotype data available, major resistance mutations were found in 32 (78%): 14 (36%) had PI mutations including V82A, M46I, and L90M; 29 (71%) had M184V/I; and three had NNRTI mutations (K103N, Y181C, and G190A). Among the children who did not achieve virologic suppression, none of the seven children treated exclusively with LPV/r developed PI-related mutations, compared with 14 of 32 (44%) who received RTV-based regimens (p=0.036); PI genotypes were unavailable for two children. Seventy-eight percent of children without virologic suppression developed resistance mutations that impact second-line ART options. Only children who received RTV-based ART developed major PI-related resistance mutations, and use of this regimen should be avoided."
Doc No.371,5412,positive/labeled,9.998912,High frequency of drug resistance mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected Korean patients treated with HAART.,"We have investigated the frequency of resistance mutations to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 37 Korean HIV-1-infected patients, 22 of whom had experienced previous monotherapy. CD4(+) T cell counts significantly increased from 135 +/- 110/microl to 523 +/- 259/microl for 39 +/- 3 months by HAART (p < 0.0001). Over 39 +/- 3 months of HAART, 18 of 37 patients (48.6%) harbored drug resistance mutations. The most frequently observed mutation was M184V (24.3%, 9/37). Seven of 35 patients (20.0%) exposed to protease inhibitors and 2 of 11 (18.2%) exposed to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors developed resistance mutations to their respective drugs. When we measured HIV-1 RNA viral loads over 30 months of HAART in 31 patients, we found that 13 patients (41.9%) showed virological treatment failure, with viral load >400 copies/ml. In conclusion, we found that the frequency of resistance mutations to antiretroviral drugs over 30 months was high in HAART-treated patients. As the first report on resistance mutations to HAART in Korea, our data suggest that genotyping-guided treatment as well as education for compliance are required for better care."
Doc No.372,6126,negative/unlabeled,9.997903,Impaired hepatitis B vaccine responses during chronic hepatitis C infection: involvement of the PD-1 pathway in regulating CD4(+) T cell responses.,"Vaccination for hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the setting of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is recommended, but responses to vaccination are blunted when compared to uninfected populations. The mechanism for this failure of immune response in HCV-infected subjects remains unknown but is thought to be a result of lymphocyte dysfunction during chronic viral infection. We have recently demonstrated that PD-1, a novel negative immunomodulator for T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, is involved in T and B lymphocyte dysregulation during chronic HCV infection. In this report, we further investigated the role of the PD-1 pathway in regulation of CD4(+) T cell responses to HBV vaccination in HCV-infected individuals. In a prospective HCV infected cohort, a poor response rate to HBV vaccination as assayed by seroconversion was observed in HCV-infected subjects (53%), while a high response rate was observed in healthy or spontaneously HCV-resolved individuals (94%). CD4(+) T cell responses to ex vivo stimulations of anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were found to be lower in HBV vaccine non-responders compared to those responders in HCV-infected individuals who had received a series of HBV immunizations. PD-1 expression on CD4(+) T cells was detected at relatively higher levels in these HBV vaccine non-responders than those who responded, and this was inversely associated with the cell activation status. Importantly, blocking the PD-1 pathway improved T cell activation and proliferation in response to ex vivo HBsAg or anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation in HBV vaccine non-responders. These results suggest that PD-1 signaling may be involved in impairing CD4(+) T cell responses to HBV vaccination in subjects with HCV infection, and raise the possibility that blocking this negative signaling pathway might improve success rates of immunization in the setting of chronic viral infection."

We compared three genotyping methods for identification of mutations known to confer drug resistance in the reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes of HIV type 1 (HIV-1). The HIV-GenotypR method (GenotypR; Specialty Laboratories, Inc., Santa Monica, Calif.) with the ABI 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.), the HIV PRT GeneChip assay (GeneChip; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif.), and the HIV-1 RT Line Probe Assay (LiPA; Innogenetics, Alpharetta, Ga.) were used to genotype plasma samples from HIV-infected patients attending the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics and the Mayo Clinic. At the time of analysis, patients were failing combination therapy (n = 18) or were treatment naive (n = 6). Forty codons of the RT and protease genes were analyzed by GenotypR and GeneChip for resistance-associated mutations. LiPA analyzed seven RT codons for mutations. Each sample was genotyped by all three assays, and each assay was subjected to pairwise comparisons. At least 92% of the codons tested (by the three assays) in paired comparisons were concordant. GenotypR and GeneChip demonstrated 96.6% concordance over the 40 codons tested. GenotypR identified slightly more mutations than GeneChip and LiPA; GeneChip identified all primary mutations that corresponded to failing treatment regimens. Each assay identified at least 84% of the mutations identified by the other assays. Mutations that were discordant between the assays mainly comprised secondary mutations and natural polymorphisms. The assays had better concordance for mutations that corresponded to current failing regimens, present in the more predominant viral quasispecies. In the treatment-naive patients, GenotypR, GeneChip, and LiPA mainly identified wild-type virus. Only the LiPA identified K70R, a possible transmitted zidovudine resistance mutation, in the RT gene of a treatment-naive patient. We conclude that although discrepancies in results exist between assays, each assay showed a similar capacity to identify potentially clinically relevant mutations related to patient treatment regimens."
Doc No.374,5255,negative/unlabeled,9.987439,Genetic analyses reveal structured HIV-1 populations in serially sampled T lymphocytes of patients receiving HAART.,"HIV-1 infection and compartmentalization in diverse leukocyte targets significantly contribute to viral persistence during suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Longitudinal analyses were performed on envelope sequences of HIV-1 populations from plasma, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 14 patients receiving HAART and 1 therapy-naive individual. Phylogenetic reconstructions and analysis of molecular variance revealed that HIV-1 populations in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells remained compartmentalized over time in most individuals. Analyses of viral genetic variation demonstrated that, despite compartmentalization remaining over time, viral subpopulations tended not to persist and evolve but instead broke down and became reconstituted by new founder viruses. Due to the profound impact of HAART on viral evolution, it was difficult to discern whether these dynamics were ongoing during treatment or predominantly established prior to the commencement of therapy. The genetic structure and viral founder effects observed in serially sampled T lymphocyte populations supported a scenario of metapopulation dynamics in the tissue(s) where different leukocytes become infected, a factor likely to contribute to the highly variable way that drug resistance evolves in different individuals during HAART."
Doc No.375,3020,positive/labeled,9.976105,Multi-state models for defining degrees of chronicity related to HIV-infected patient therapy adherence.,"Few studies on AIDS that evaluate factors associated with treatment failure have considered the slow evolution of the disease and multiple health state transitions following the use of antiretrovirals. In this article we study factors associated with the progression between different stages of the disease, focusing on therapy adherence using a sample of 722 HIV+ patients followed up for 3 years. States were defined using the following classifications of the CD4 cell count: s₁ (CD4 ≥ 500); s₂ (350 ≤ CD4 < 500); and s₃ (CD4 < 350). The transitions between states were modeled using multi-state models. Antiretroviral therapy adherence and disease duration were associated with transitions between immune states during follow-up. Low adherence increased the hazard ratio of a transition between s₁ to s₂ and intermediate adherence increased the hazard ratio of a transition between s₂ to s₃. On the other hand, older age and disease duration between two and four years are protective factors for AIDS progression. Multi-state modeling is a powerful approach for studying chronic diseases and estimating factors associated with transitions between each stage of progression, thus enabling the use of more individualized and effective interventions."
Doc No.376,1566,negative/unlabeled,9.969828,Correlation of in vitro T-cell and B-cell function with responses to childhood vaccines in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"We analyzed T-cell responses to mitogens and antigens and B-cell differentiation in response to T-cell dependent (TCD) and independent stimuli in 22 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children (1 to 9 years of age) according to the presence of protective humoral immunity at a mean time of 18 months after vaccination with Haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B, diphtheria, and tetanus vaccines. The 17 vaccine responders had a mean of 3.2 responses. However, their antibody levels were lower compared with healthy children. The 5 nonresponders had a mean of 0.84 responses. There were no significant differences between responders and nonresponders regarding age, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) disease class, CDC immunologic class, serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, or in the use of antiretroviral therapy. However, responders tended to have higher age-adjusted absolute CD4 cell counts than nonresponders (p = 0.07). Nonetheless, there was no correlation between antibody levels and age-adjusted CD4 counts for each of the 4 TCD vaccines. Responders had conserved lymphoproliferative responses to mitogens and to candida antigen; 7 (41%) had normal responses to tetanus antigen. While nonresponders had some conserved responses to mitogens, only 1 had a response to antigen. Thirteen responders (77%) and only 1 nonresponder (20%) had normal responses to at least 2 of the 3 mitogens and 1 of the 2 antigens (p = 0.04). Although defects in B-cell differentiation were detected in both groups, they were profound and generalized in the nonresponders. Fourteen responders (82%) had at least 1 normal B-cell response compared with none of the 5 nonresponders (p = 0.002). There were no correlations between normal lymphoproliferative responses and age, CD4 counts, serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, or the use of antiretroviral therapy. Immunologic function is important in the evaluation of HIV-infected children."
Doc No.377,7107,negative/unlabeled,9.968069,Drug-resistant reverse transcriptase genotyping and phenotyping of B and non-B subtypes (F and A) of human immunodeficiency virus type I found in Brazilian patients failing HAART.,"Development of drug resistance is the inevitable consequence of incomplete suppression of virus plasma levels in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy. Resistance mutations previously characterized have been found in B subtype viruses of developed countries. Moreover, mutation profiles for non-B and more divergent B subtype viruses found in developing countries shall be analyzed together with their ex vivo phenotyping in order to establish an exact correlation between the genotyping data and the clinical management counseling for those uncommon virus subtypes. In the present study, we evaluated the mutation profile for individuals infected with B subtype and non-B subtype viruses. Viral DNA fragments corresponding to the RT gene were amplified, sequenced, and subtyped. Phenotyping analysis for reverse transcriptase nucleoside (NRTI) and nonnucleoside inhibitor susceptibility was performed using the recombinant virus assay technology. Brazilian non-B subtypes (subtype F, n = 4, and subtype A, n = 1) isolates showed essentially the same B subtype mutation profile, presenting an NRTI drug resistance with similar MIC50% and MIC90% values for all drugs analyzed regardless of their subtypes. A strong cross-resistance phenotype among AZT, 3TC, and abacavir could be seen in all isolates analyzed. A novel result was that some RT sequences not only revealed the presence of G333D/E mutations but also correlated to the presence of mutation T386I that could abrogate the M184V-surpassing effect of L210W or L210W plus G333D/E. These findings suggest that Brazilian non-B subtype HIV-1 strains use an identical RT drug resistance mutation pattern when compared to B isolates and will contribute to the validation of the genotypic and phenotypic tests in these predominant worldwide-spread viral variants."
Doc No.378,2387,negative/unlabeled,9.96168,Expanded HIV-1 cellular tropism by phenotypic mixing with murine endogenous retroviruses.,"In view of the current interest in in vivo murine models for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the interaction between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and endogenous murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-related retroviruses was investigated with a human leukemic T cell line (PF-382x) that acquired xenotropic MuLV (X-MuLV) after in vivo passage in immunosuppressed mice. Despite similar levels of membrane CD4 expression and HIV-1 125I-labeled gp 120 binding, a dramatic acceleration in the time course of HIV-1 infection was observed in PF-382x compared to its X-MuLV-negative counterpart (PF-382). Moreover, PF-382 cells coinfected by X-MuLV and HIV-1 generated a progeny of phenotypically mixed viral particles, enabling HIV-1 to productively infect a panel of CD4- human cells, including B lymphoid cells and purified normal peripheral blood CD4-/CD8+ T lymphocytes. Mixed viral phenotypes were also produced by human CD4+ T cells coinfected with an amphotropic MuLV-related retrovirus (A-MuLV) and HIV-1. These data show that endogenous MuLV acquired by human cells transplanted into mice can significantly interact with HIV-1, thereby inducing important alterations of HIV-1 biological properties."
Doc No.379,8500,negative/unlabeled,9.961483,Increased T cell trafficking as adjunct therapy for HIV-1.,"Although antiretroviral drug therapy suppresses human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) to undetectable levels in the blood of treated individuals, reservoirs of replication competent HIV-1 endure. Upon cessation of antiretroviral therapy, the reservoir usually allows outgrowth of virus and approaches to targeting the reservoir have had limited success. Ongoing cycles of viral replication in regions with low drug penetration contribute to this persistence. Here, we use a mathematical model to illustrate a new approach to eliminating the part of the reservoir attributable to persistent replication in drug sanctuaries. Reducing the residency time of CD4 T cells in drug sanctuaries renders ongoing replication unsustainable in those sanctuaries. We hypothesize that, in combination with antiretroviral drugs, a strategy to orchestrate CD4 T cell trafficking could contribute to a functional cure for HIV-1 infection."
Doc No.380,5376,negative/unlabeled,9.955788,Plasma membrane-targeted Raf kinase activates NF-kappaB and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in T lymphocytes.,"Increasing evidence points to a role of the mitogenic Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade in regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression. Stimulation of elements of this pathway leads to transactivation of the HIV-1 promoter. In particular, the NF-kappaB motif in the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) represents a Raf-responsive element in fibroblasts. Regulation of the Raf kinase in T cells differs from findings with a variety of cell lines that the catalytic domain of Raf (Raf(delta26-303)) shows no activity. In this study, we restored the activity of the kinase in T cells by fusing its catalytic domain to the CAAX motif (-Cx) of Ras, thus targeting the enzyme to the plasma membrane. Constitutive activity of Raf was demonstrated by phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and endogenous mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in A3.01 T cells transfected with Raf(delta26-303)-Cx. Membrane-targeted Raf also stimulates NF-kappaB, as judged by kappaB-dependent reporter assays and enhanced NF-kappaB p65 binding on band shift analysis. Moreover, we found that active Raf transactivates the HIV(NL4-3) LTR in A3.01 T lymphocytes and that dominant negative Raf (C4) blocked 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced transactivation. When cotransfected with infectious HIV(NL4-3) DNA, membrane-targeted Raf induces viral replication up to 10-fold over basal levels, as determined by the release of newly synthesized p24gag protein. Our study clearly demonstrates that the activity of the catalytic domain of Raf in A3.01 T cells is dependent on its cellular localization. The functional consequences of active Raf in T lymphocytes include not only NF-kappaB activation and transactivation of the HIV(NL4-3) LTR but also synthesis and release of HIV particles."

Here, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA positivity, drug resistance mutations and their association with HBV genotypes were evaluated in chronically HBV-infected patients under different drug regimens in Brazil. The study involved 129 patients under interferon or nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy for a median treatment time of 12 months. One hundred and five (81%) of these patients were treated with lamivudine (LAM), either in monotherapy or in combination with newer drugs, such as entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir (TDF). High (37.5-100%) rates of HBV DNA positivity were observed with all but one drug regimen (LAM + ETV). However, patients that were treated with ETV alone, TDF alone or with LAM combination therapies had a mean viral load that was 3-4 log lower than patients treated with LAM monotherapy. Of the patients treated with LAM, 47% developed resistance mutations. HBV genotypes A (59.1%), D (30.3%) and F (9.1%) were found. There was no association between the presence of LAM resistance mutations and genotypes, HBeAg status or treatment duration. Nevertheless, the rtM204V mutation was observed more frequently (12/13, 92%) in genotype A than in the others (p = 0.023). Six out of nine isolates that contained the rtM204I mutation belonged to genotype D and half of them displayed a single mutation. Genotype D isolates with the rtM204V variant preferentially displayed a triple mutation, while genotype A preferentially displayed a double mutation (p = 0.04)."
Doc No.382,6613,negative/unlabeled,9.943741,Elevated levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in the plasma of HIV-1-infected patients and in HIV-1-infected cell cultures: a relevant role on viral replication.,"The cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and infectious diseases, however its role in HIV-1 infection is unknown. Here we show that HIV-1-infected patients present elevated plasma levels of MIF, that HIV-1-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) release a greater amount of MIF, and that the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 induces MIF secretion from uninfected PBMCs. The HIV-1 replication in PBMCs declines when these cells are treated with anti-MIF antibodies, and exposure of HIV-1-infected cells to the ABC-transporter inhibitor probenecid results in inhibition of MIF secretion. The addition of recombinant MIF (rhMIF) to HIV-1-infected PBMCs enhances viral replication of CCR5- or CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolates. Using a T CD4(+) cell lineage containing an HIV long terminal repeats (LTR)-Luciferase construct, we detected that rhMIF promotes transcription from HIV-1 LTR. Our results show that HIV-1 induces MIF secretion and suggest that MIF influences the HIV-1 biology through activation of HIV-1 LTR."
Doc No.383,4426,negative/unlabeled,9.942038,Generation of CD3+CD8low thymocytes in the HIV type 1-infected thymus.,"Infection with the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) can result both in depletion of CD4(+) T cells and in the generation of dysfunctional CD8(+) T cells. In HIV-1-infected children, repopulation of the peripheral T cell pool is mediated by the thymus, which is itself susceptible to HIV-1 infection. Previous work has shown that MHC class I (MHC I) molecules are strongly up-regulated as result of IFN-alpha secretion in the HIV-1-infected thymus. We demonstrate in this study that increased MHC I up-regulation on thymic epithelial cells and double-positive CD3(-/int)CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes correlates with the generation of mature single-positive CD4(-)CD8(+) thymocytes that have low expression of CD8. Treatment of HIV-1-infected thymus with highly active antiretroviral therapy normalizes MHC I expression and surface CD8 expression on such CD4(-)CD8(+) thymocytes. In pediatric patients with possible HIV-1 infection of the thymus, a low CD3 percentage in the peripheral circulation is also associated with a CD8(low) phenotype on circulating CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, CD8(low) peripheral T cells from these HIV-1(+) pediatric patients are less responsive to stimulation by Ags from CMV. These data indicate that IFN-alpha-mediated MHC I up-regulation on thymic epithelial cells may lead to high avidity interactions with developing double-positive thymocytes and drive the selection of dysfunctional CD3(+)CD8(low) T cells. We suggest that this HIV-1-initiated selection process may contribute to the generation of dysfunctional CD8(+) T cells in HIV-1-infected patients."
Doc No.384,2066,negative/unlabeled,9.941329,"The impact of genetic variation in IL28B, IFNL4 and HLA genes on treatment responses against chronic hepatitis C virus infection.","Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the interleukin-28B (IL28B), interferon lambda 4 (IFNL4) and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene are associated with treatment responses in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus infection treated with pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin (pegIFN-α/RBV). We compared the role of IL28B SNPs (rs12979860, rs12980275, and rs8099917), IFNL4 ss469415590 and HLA rs4273729 with treatment outcomes in patients with CHC virus. A total of 520 Iranian patients with CHC infection were enrolled. SNPs in IL28B, IFNL4 ss469415590 and HLA rs4273729 were genotyped by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, TaqMan® Real-Time PCR and direct sequence. Out of 520 CHC treatment-naive patients, 42.9% were infected with HCV-1a, 15.4% with HCV-1b, 9.8% with HCV-2, and 31.9% with HCV-3a. Rapid virologic response (RVR), complete early virologic response (cEVR), and sustained virologic response (SVR) were 53.3%, 73.8%, and 66.7%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that IL28B rs12980275 and IFNL4 ss469415590 in all HCV genotypes were associated with RVR. In addition, IL28B rs12979860 and RVR in all HCV genotypes and IL28B rs12980275, IFNL4 ss469415590, and HLA rs4273729 in HCV subtypes 1a, 1b, and 3a correlated with cEVR. In patient's achieving-SVR, IL28B rs12980275, and RVR in all HCV genotypes and IL28B rs12979860, IFNL4 ss469415590, and HLA rs4273729 in HCV subtypes 1a, 1b, and 3a were the powerful predictor factors. As the first report of its kind published in Iran, we indicated that beside IL28B SNPs and HLA rs4273729, IFNL4 ss469415590 was a powerful predictor factor for RVR, cEVR and SVR. Genotyping these SNPs may be a helpful priority in the treatment of patients with HCV infection, especially in countries where access to triple or double therapy with a viral protease inhibitor is limited."
Doc No.385,4330,negative/unlabeled,9.936218,Influence of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Infection on laboratory parameters of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) share routes of transmission and some individuals have dual infection. Although some studies point to a worse prognosis of hepatitis C virus in patients co-infected with HTLV-1, the interaction between these two infections is poorly understood. This study evaluated the influence of HTLV-1 infection on laboratory parameters in chronic HCV patients. Twelve HTLV-1/HCV-coinfected patients were compared to 23 patients infected only with HCV, in regard to demographic data, risk factors for viral acquisition, HCV genotype, presence of cirrhosis, T CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts and liver function tests. There was no difference in regard to age, gender, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, HCV genotype or presence of cirrhosis between the groups. Intravenous drug use was the most common risk factor among individuals co-infected with HTLV-1. These patients showed higher TCD8+ counts (p = 0.0159) and significantly lower median values of AST and ALT (p = 0.0437 and 0.0159, respectively). In conclusion, we have shown that HCV/HTLV-1 co-infected patients differs in laboratorial parameters involving both liver and immunological patterns. The meaning of these interactions in the natural history of these infections is a matter that deserves further studies."
Doc No.386,3540,negative/unlabeled,9.934658,Role of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 envelope in the anti-HIV activity of the betulinic acid derivative IC9564.,"The betulinic acid derivative IC9564 is a potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) compound that can inhibit both HIV primary isolates and laboratory-adapted strains. However, this compound did not affect the replication of simian immunodeficiency virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Results from a syncytium formation assay indicated that IC9564 blocked HIV type 1 (HIV-1) envelope-mediated membrane fusion. Analysis of a chimeric virus derived from exchanging envelope regions between IC9564-sensitive and IC9564-resistant viruses indicated that regions within gp120 and the N-terminal 25 amino acids (fusion domain) of gp41 are key determinants for the drug sensitivity. By developing a drug-resistant mutant from the NL4-3 virus, two mutations were found within the gp120 region and one was found within the gp41 region. The mutations are G237R and R252K in gp120 and R533A in the fusion domain of gp41. The mutations were reintroduced into the NL4-3 envelope and analyzed for their role in IC9564 resistance. Both of the gp120 mutations contributed to the drug sensitivity. On the contrary, the gp41 mutation (R533A) did not appear to affect the IC9564 sensitivity. These results suggest that HIV-1 gp120 plays a key role in the anti-HIV-1 activity of IC9564."

This study's purpose was to examine participant responsiveness and tobacco dependence treatment adherence and their influences on tobacco abstinence among HIV-infected patients. This non-randomized study included HIV-infected smokers 18 years of age or older, who smoked at least 5 cigarettes per day, and had an interest in quitting smoking in the next 30 days. HIV-infected smokers (n = 247) received a 12-week tobacco dependence treatment intervention that included pharmacotherapy and telephone counseling. Younger age and non-White race were associated with lower adherence to pharmacotherapy. Younger age, non-White race, and increased monthly binge drinking were associated with lower adherence to telephone counseling. High participant responsiveness was associated with adherence to pharmacotherapy, counseling, and abstinence. Development and testing of interventions to improve adherence to evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment is warranted."
Doc No.388,6140,negative/unlabeled,9.924197,Association of interleukin-18 gene polymorphisms with hepatitis B virus clearance.,"The outcome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can be affected by host immune factors. Interleukin-18 (IL-18) was originally discovered as an interferon-gamma-inducing factor and plays a critical role in immune response. We assessed the association between the clearance of HBV infection and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-18 gene. Between March 2002 and December 2004, a total of 1,050 Korean subjects were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups: (1) the HBV spontaneous recovery group (n = 320) and (2) the chronic HBV carrier group (n = 730). We analyzed SNPs at four polymorphic sites in the IL-18 gene at positions -667G>T, -148G>C, +8925C>G, and +13925A>C. We observed that the subjects bearing the IL-18 -148C allele [odds ratio (OR), 0.25; confidence interval (CI), 0.09-0.68; P = 0.01], the +8925G allele (OR, 0.36; CI, 0.15-0.88; P = 0.02), and the +13925C allele (OR, 0.25; CI, 0.13-0.82; P = 0.01) were significantly associated with HBV clearance in a recessive model. This study indicates that the -148C, +8925G, and +13925C alleles of the IL-18 gene are likely associated with HBV clearance in a Korean population."
Doc No.389,34,negative/unlabeled,9.917742,Meeting the complex needs of individuals living with HIV: a case study approach.,"This article critically discusses the nursing care and management of a person living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as a long-term condition, requiring highly complex HIV care. Complex HIV care is managed in the secondary care setting. However, recent legislation has motivated shifts in HIV care to the community care setting. This article aims to enhance health professionals' understanding in order to equip practice and district nurses to deliver HIV care provision. Antiretroviral adherence is a prerequisite for disease survival as well as an essential component of complete HIV self-care management. It is therefore imperative that nurses tailor adherence strategies according to each patient's requirements. Case management strategies such as the use of cognitive behavioural therapy to alleviate depressive symptoms will be considered. Furthermore, the use of motivational interviewing for antiretroviral adherence is highlighted as a potential intervention to help patients overcome the physical, psychological and physiological challenges of living with HIV-associated comorbidities. The delivery of integrated HIV care is pivotal for the management of the person living with HIV, as is the facilitation of a self-caring behaviour. "
Doc No.390,33,negative/unlabeled,9.915286,"Drug resistance mutations among HIV-1 strains from antiretroviral-naive patients in Martinique, French West Indies.","We report on the frequency of genetic mutations associated with drug resistance in antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from Martinique (French West Indies), where zidovudine (ZDV) has been available since 1987 and where combination therapy developed simultaneously with its use in continental France. Genotypic resistance was studied in plasma HIV RNA from samples collected between 1988 and 1998 from 70 antiretroviral-naive study subjects, half presenting with either primary infection or documented seroconversion. A line probe assay (LIPA) was used to detect substitutions on the reverse transcriptase (RT) codons 41, 69, 70, 74, 184, and 215. Direct sequencing was used to complete the data for RT codons which were uninterpretable by LIPA. Of these patients, 17 harbored mutated viruses with one or more mutations in the RT gene codons analyzed. ZDV resistance mutations T215Y/F, M41L, and K70R were found in 2, 5, and 12 individuals, respectively. Mutant strains L74V (didanosine [ddI] and dideoxycytidine [ddC]) were detected in 3 patients and M184V (lamivudine/ddI/ddC) in 4 patients. However, pure mutant results at one or more codons of interest were observed in only 5 (7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-13%) patients, all involving ZDV resistance. One carried both mutations T215Y and M41L known to confer a high degree of phenotypic resistance to ZDV. Among a subgroup of 28 patients with a timepoint of infection after 1995, 24 [86%; approximately 95% CI, 73%-99%) presented with a wild-type pattern. The significance of the high prevalence of mixed patterns observed in drug-naive patients remains unclear. However, the frequency of primary mutant genotypes associated with high levels of drug resistance is low in Martinique and in this study we did not observe any currently increased tendency in this frequency."
Doc No.391,3435,negative/unlabeled,9.906652,"PITALRE, the catalytic subunit of TAK, is required for human immunodeficiency virus Tat transactivation in vivo.","The human cdc2-related kinase PITALRE is the catalytic component of TAK, the Tat-associated kinase. Previously, we have proposed that TAK is a cellular factor that mediates Tat transactivation function. Here we demonstrate that transient overexpression of PITALRE specifically squelches Tat-1 activation of both a transfected and an integrated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR), suggesting that PITALRE mediates Tat function as a multiprotein complex. A catalytic mutant of PITALRE, D167N, was found to be more efficient than wild-type PITALRE in squelching Tat transactivation. Neither wild-type PITALRE nor D167N was able to squelch transactivation of the human T-cell leukemia type 1 LTR by the Tax protein. Additionally, we show that artificial targeting of PITALRE to a nascent RNA element, in the absence of Tat, activated HIV-1 LTR expression. These results indicate that a PITALRE-containing complex mediates transactivation by Tat and suggest that Tat proteins function by localizing such a PITALRE-containing complex to the site of the transcribing provirus."

However, RNA dependant virus replication has a high mutation rate. Human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 protease plays an essential role in viral replication cycle. This protein is an important target for therapy with viral protein inhibitors. There are few works using normal mode analysis to investigate this problem from the structural changes viewpoint. The investigation of protein flexibility may be important for the study of processes associated with conformational changes and state transitions. The normal mode analysis allowed us to investigate structural changes in the protease (such as flexibility) in a straightforward way and try to associate these changes with the increase of fitness for each positively selected HIV-1 mutant protease of patients treated with several protease inhibitors (saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, fosamprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, and tripanavir) in combination or separately. These positively selected mutations introduce significant flexibility in important regions such as the active site cavity and flaps. These mutations were also able to cause changes in accessible solvent area. This study showed that the majority of HIV-1 protease mutants can be grouped into two main classes of protein flexibility behavior. We presented a new approach to study structural changes caused by positively selected mutations in a pathogen protein, for instance the HIV-1 protease and their relationship with their resistance mechanism against known inhibitors. The method can be applied to any pharmaceutically relevant pathogen proteins and could be very useful to understand the effects of positively selected mutations in the context of structural changes."
Doc No.393,5732,negative/unlabeled,9.89237,Structure-function analysis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120 amino acid mutations associated with resistance to the CCR5 coreceptor antagonist vicriviroc.,"Vicriviroc (VCV) is a small-molecule CCR5 coreceptor antagonist currently in clinical trials for treatment of R5-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. With this drug in development, identification of resistance mechanisms to VCV is needed to allow optimal outcomes in clinical practice. In this study we further characterized VCV resistance in a lab-adapted, VCV-resistant RU570 virus (RU570-VCV(res)). We show that K305R, R315Q, and K319T amino acid changes in the V3 loop, along with P437S in C4, completely reproduced the resistance phenotype in a chimeric ADA envelope containing the C2-V5 region from RU570 passage control gp120. The K305R amino acid change primarily impacted the degree of resistance, whereas K319T contributed to both resistance and virus infectivity. The P437S mutation in C4 had more influence on the relative degree of virus infectivity, while the R315Q mutation contributed to the virus concentration-dependent phenotypic resistance pattern observed for RU570-VCV(res). RU570-VCV(res) pseudovirus entry with VCV-bound CCR5 was dramatically reduced by Y10A, D11A, Y14A, and Y15A mutations in the N terminus of CCR5, whereas these mutations had less impact on entry in the absence of VCV. Notably, an additional Q315E/I317F substitution in the crown region of the V3 loop enhanced resistance to VCV, resulting in a stronger dependence on the N terminus for viral entry. By fitting the envelope mutations to a molecular model of a recently described docked N-terminal CCR5 peptide consisting of residues 2 to 15 in complex with HIV-1 gp120 CD4, potential new interactions in gp120 with the N terminus of CCR5 were uncovered. The cumulative results of this study suggest that as the RU570 VCV-resistant virus adapted to use the drug-bound receptor, it also developed an increased reliance on the N terminus of CCR5."

The LTNP were compared with patients in the early phase of infection and patients who had progressed to advanced immunodeficiency. Changes in CD8(+) subset distribution were observed mainly at acquisition of HIV-1 infection, whereas CD4(+) subset changes appeared during progression of HIV-1 infection. The decreasing levels of CD4(+) cells were characterized by an increasing frequency of cells expressing the activation markers HLA-Dr and CD45RO but not the CD28 surface antigen. The LTNP exhibited significant changes compared to HIV-negative patients in almost all markers. Compared to patients in the early phase of infection, the only difference was a relatively lower frequency of CD4(+) cells expressing CD26 among the LTNP. The results show that HIV-1-infected persons who have no signs of immunodeficiency despite many years of infection have an immunophenotypic pattern that is substantially different from that of noninfected persons. Despite the long duration of infection, the LTNP exhibit a pattern similar to that of newly infected persons, with the exception of lower expression of CD26 on CD4(+) cells."

Sera from 69 Chinese patients with chronic HBV infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction amplification of HBV DNA to determine the frequency and location of naturally occurring HBV core gene mutations. All but one patient had nucleotide changes, and 44 (64%) patients had at least one amino acid change (mean, 3.7; range, 1-13) when compared with published sequences. Multiple regression analysis showed that the frequency of core gene mutations was significantly associated with precore stop-codon mutation, hepatitis B e antigen negativity, and active liver disease, but not patients' age. The mean number of amino acid changes/patient for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients with elevated versus normal aminotransferase levels were, respectively, 2.8 +/- 0.4 and 0.6 +/- 0.2. The corresponding values for HBeAg-negative patients were, respectively, 5.0 +/- 1.2 and 6.0 +/- 1.5. Thirteen patients were serially studied, the mean rates of amino acid substitution in HBeAg-positive patients who did or did not clear HBeAg during follow-up were 5.7 +/- 0.8 and 0 per codon/yr. Most of the mutations were clustered in the codon/yr. Most of the mutations were clustered in the middle of the core gene that harbor several major B- and helper T-cell epitopes. Very few mutations were found in the C-terminal part of the core gene. In summary, mutations in the core gene can be frequently detected in patients with chronic HBV infection. These mutations occur predominantly around the time of HBeAg clearance when liver disease is most active."

Adherence was measured by self-reported number of ART pills/capsules missed during the previous week and previous month, evaluated as satisfactory when less than 5%. 101 HIV+ adults took part in this study, 60.4% males, ranging from 20 to 71 years of age (mean = 37.9 years), and 73.3% symptomatic. Data procedures included interviews and the use of validated instruments. The majority of participants (n = 73; 72.3%) reported adherence of > 95%. Logistic regression showed that a history of self-reported ART interruption and self-efficacy expectations were significant adherence predictors. Upgrading of care with interdisciplinary teams is needed to develop an appropriate approach to the medical and psychosocial difficulties of ART adherence by persons with HIV/AIDS."

However, to accomplish this, all the steps that define the HIV care continuum must be achieved at high levels, including HIV testing and diagnosis, linkage to and retention in clinical care, antiretroviral medication initiation, and adherence to achieve and maintain viral suppression. The HPTN 065 (Test, Link-to-Care Plus Treat [TLC-Plus]) study was designed to determine the feasibility of the ""test and treat"" approach in the United States. Methods HPTN 065 was conducted in two intervention communities, Bronx, NY, and Washington, DC, along with four non-intervention communities, Chicago, IL; Houston, TX; Miami, FL; and Philadelphia, PA. The study consisted of five components: (1) exploring the feasibility of expanded HIV testing via social mobilization and the universal offer of testing in hospital settings, (2) evaluating the effectiveness of financial incentives to increase linkage to care, (3) evaluating the effectiveness of financial incentives to increase viral suppression, (4) evaluating the effectiveness of a computer-delivered intervention to decrease risk behavior in HIV-positive patients in healthcare settings, and (5) administering provider and patient surveys to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding the use of antiretroviral therapy for prevention and the use of financial incentives to improve health outcomes. The study used observational cohorts, cluster and individual randomization, and made novel use of the existing national HIV surveillance data infrastructure. All components were developed with input from a community advisory board, and pragmatic methods were used to implement and assess the outcomes for each study component. Results A total of 76 sites in Washington, DC, and the Bronx, NY, participated in the study: 37 HIV test sites, including 16 hospitals, and 39 HIV care sites. Between September 2010 and December 2014, all study components were successfully implemented at these sites and resulted in valid outcomes. Our pragmatic approach to the study design, implementation, and the assessment of study outcomes allowed the study to be conducted within established programmatic structures and processes. In addition, it was successfully layered on the ongoing standard of care and existing data infrastructure without disrupting health services. Conclusion The HPTN 065 study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a multi-component ""test and treat"" trial that included a large number of community sites and involved pragmatic approaches to study implementation and evaluation."

Doc No.399,2373,negative/unlabeled,9.873409,Isolation of a cellular factor that can reactivate latent HIV-1 without T cell activation.,"HIV-1 latency in resting CD4(+) T cells represents a major barrier to virus eradication in patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Eliminating the latent HIV-1 reservoir may require the reactivation of viral gene expression in latently infected cells. Most approaches for reactivating latent HIV-1 require nonspecific T cell activation, which has potential toxicity. To identify factors for reactivating latent HIV-1 without inducing global T cell activation, we performed a previously undescribed unbiased screen for genes that could activate transcription from the HIV-1 LTR in an NF-kappaB-independent manner, and isolated an alternatively spliced form of the transcription factor Ets-1, DeltaVII-Ets-1. DeltaVII-Ets-1 activated HIV-1 transcription through 2 conserved regions in the LTR, and reactivated latent HIV-1 in cells from patients on HAART without causing significant T cell activation. Our results highlight the therapeutic potential of cellular factors for the reactivation of latent HIV-1 and provide an efficient approach for their identification."

Down-regulating effect of mitogens.,"Spontaneous in vitro production of HIV-1-specific antibodies, a hallmark of infected subjects, is often down-regulated by the addition of pokeweed mitogen. We observed that a decrease in such ongoing anti-HIV-1 antibody synthesis could also be induced in cultures from most patients by addition of phytohemagglutinin and Concanavalin A, but not by Epstein-Barr virus, a selective B-cell mitogen. In most cases, this down-regulatory effect of mitogens was evident within the first 24 h of culture. The observed mitogen-associated decrease in spontaneous antibody synthesis was prevented by treating peripheral blood mononuclear cells with agents inhibiting non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic activity or by adding third-party cells to the cultures. In most cases, the mitogen-induced effect was also counteracted by removal of T lymphocytes or CD8+ T-cell sub-population. These findings recall a similar phenomenon observed in normal subjects following intentional immunization, and indicate that mitogen-induced down-regulation of spontaneous in vitro anti-HIV-1-antibody production most probably occurs through a lectin-dependent cytotoxic effect on activated B cells."
Doc No.401,3363,negative/unlabeled,9.8569145,The anti-idiotypic antibody 1F7 selectively inhibits cytotoxic T cells activated in HIV-1 infection.,"Circulating CD8+ T lymphocyte numbers rise substantially following infection with HIV-1. This expanded CD8+ T cell population includes HIV-specific CTL and CTL that kill activated uninfected CD4+ lymphocytes. Experimental, epidemiological and clinical evidence supports the possibility that expansion of CD8+ CTL contributes to CD4+ T cell depletion and disease progression in human HIV infection. Therefore, modulation of CD8+ T cell numbers or of certain CD8+ CTL activated in HIV-infected individuals may be beneficial. It was found that 1F7, a mAb against an idiotype common to anti-HIV and anti-simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) antibodies, selectively inhibited both anti-HIV CTL and CTL against uninfected CD4+ T cells. Alloantigen-specific CTL and NK cells from either HIV-infected individuals or controls were unaffected by 1F7. Prolonged incubation of CD8+ T cells from HIV-infected individuals with 1F7 induces apoptosis, which was shown to be reflected functionally in reduced total CTL activity and in especially reduced CTL activity against uninfected CD4+ lymphocytes. The selective reactivity of 1F7 with certain CD8+ CTL could be applied towards the modulation of CD8+ T cell responses involved in AIDS pathogenesis."
Doc No.402,644,negative/unlabeled,9.8443575,Naturally occurring mutations in the nonstructural region 5B of hepatitis C virus (HCV) from treatment-naïve Korean patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1b.,"The nonstructural 5B (NS5B) protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity plays a pivotal role in viral replication. Therefore, monitoring of its naturally occurring mutations is very important for the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines. In the present study, mutations in the partial NS5B gene (492 bp) from 166 quasispecies of 15 genotype-1b (GT) treatment-naïve Korean chronic patients were determined and mutation patterns and frequencies mainly focusing on the T cell epitope regions were evaluated. The mutation frequency within the CD8+ T cell epitopes was significantly higher than those outside the CD8+ T cell epitopes. Of note, the mutation frequency within predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, a particular mutational hotspot in Korean patients was significantly higher than it was in patients from other areas, suggesting distinctive CD4+ T cell-mediated immune pressure against HCV infection in the Korean population. The mutation frequency in the NS5B region was positively correlated with patients with carrier-stage rather than progressive liver disease (chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Furthermore, the mutation frequency in four codons (Q309, A333, V338 and Q355) known to be related to the sustained virological response (SVR) and end-of treatment response (ETR) was also significantly higher in Korean patients than in patients from other areas. In conclusion, a high degree of mutation frequency in the HCV GT-1b NS5B region, particularly in the predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, was found in Korean patients, suggesting the presence of distinctive CD4+ T cell pressure in the Korean population. This provides a likely explanation of why relatively high levels of SVR after a combined therapy of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) in Korean chronic patients with GT-1b infections are observed.

This study examined human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific lymphocyte proliferation before and after treatment with an inactivated HIV-1 immunogen in 15 chronically infected HIV-1 seropositive subjects. Lymphocyte proliferation to the immunizing antigen (gp120-depleted HIV-1; P<.001), purified native p24 (P<.001), and recombinant p24 (P<.05) increased after treatment with the HIV-specific immune-based therapy. By HIV-1 antigen-specific flow cytometry, T helper CD4 lymphocytes, CD8 lymphocytes, and NK cells (all P<.001) were the predominant cell types proliferating in vitro after treatment. Additional phenotyping of proliferating cells revealed predominantly CD4 and CD8 memory (both P<.001) phenotypes. This study supports the concept that in vitro lymphocyte proliferation to HIV-1 antigens, augmented after treatment with an inactivated HIV-1 immunogen, involves primarily CD4 and CD8 cell memory immune responses."
Doc No.404,4857,negative/unlabeled,9.8336935,Virus entry as a target for anti-HIV intervention.,"The replicative cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be interrupted at several stages. Until recently only the viral reverse transcriptase and protease were the only enzymes targeted by antiretroviral agents. However, the first HIV entry inhibitor (T-20, Enfuvirtide, Fuseon) to be used in humans has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The HIV entry process is considered as an attractive target for chemotherapeutic intervention, as blocking HIV entry into its target cell leads to suppression of viral infectivity, replication and the cytotoxicity induced by virus-cell contacts. HIV-1 entry into target cells is a multistep process: virus attachment is initiated by the binding of trimeric envelope glycoprotein gp120 complexes on the virions to glycosylated T-cell surface receptor (CD4) and HIV GPCR coreceptors (CCR5 or CXCR4) leading to envelope glycoprotein gp41-dependent fusion-pore formation and membrane fusion. A number of compounds are being developed to specifically target each of these steps leading to virus entry and some compounds have reached early clinical development. Conversely, agents such as the CCR5 antagonist Tak-779 and the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 are not longer being thought as relevant anti-HIV agents but have given way to new analogues with improved properties. This review summarizes the current state of HIV entry inhibitors, their mechanisms of action and their therapeutic value against HIV infection and AIDS."
Doc No.405,9291,negative/unlabeled,9.825527,Clinical data sets of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase-resistant mutants explained by a mathematical model.,"Treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection during the clinical latency phase with drugs inhibiting reverse transcriptase (RT) reduces the HIV-1 RNA load and increases the CD4+ T-cell count. Typically, however, the virus evolves mutations in the RT gene that circumvent the drugs. We develop a mathematical model for this situation. The model distinguishes quiescent from activated CD4+ T cells, incorporates the fact that only activated cells can become productively infected by HIV-1, embodies empirical estimates for the drug resistance and the mutation frequency for each of the HIV-1 drug-resistant mutants, and assumes the antiviral immune response to remain constant over the course of the experiments. We analyze clinical data on the evolution of drug-resistant mutants for the RT inhibitors lamivudine and zidovudine. The results show that the evolutionary sequence of the drug-resistant mutants in both data sets is accounted for by our model, given that lamivudine is more effective than zidovudine. Thus, current empirical estimates of the mutation frequencies and the drug resistances of the mutants suffice for explaining the data. We derive a critical treatment level below which the wild-type HIV-1 RNA load can rebound before the first drug-resistant mutant appears. Our zidovudine data confirm this to be the case. Thus, we demonstrate in the model and the data that the rebound of the HIV-1 RNA load in the case of zidovudine is due to the outgrowth of wild-type virus and the first drug-resistant mutant, whereas that in the case of lamivudine can only be due to the drug-resistant mutants. The evolution of drug resistance proceeds slower in the case of zidovudine because (i) zidovudine is not as effective as lamivudine and (ii) the first zidovudine drug-resistant mutant is competing with the rebounding wild-type virus."

SECOND-LINE study participants were assessed at baseline for HIV-1 subtype, demographics, HIV-1 history, ART exposure, viral load (VL), CD4(+) count, and genotypic ART resistance. We used backward stepwise multivariate regression (MVR) to assess associations between baseline variables and presence of ≥3 N(t)RTI mutations, ≥1 NNRTI mutation, ≥3 thymidine analog-N(t)RTI [ta-N(t)RTI] mutations (TAMs), the K65/K70 mutation, and predicted etravirine (ETV)/rilpivirine (RPV) activity. The inclusion p-value for MVR was p < .2. The exclusion p-value from stepwise elimination was p > .05. Of 541 participants, 491 (91%) had successfully characterized baseline viral isolates. Subtype distribution: B (n = 123, 25%), C (n = 202, 41%), CRF01_AE (n = 109, 22%), G (n = 25, 5%), and CRF02_AG (n = 27, 5%). Baseline CD4(+) 200-394 cells/mm(3) were associated with <3 N(t)RTI mutations (OR = 0.47; 95% CI 0.29-0.77; p = .003), absence of the K65/K70 mutation (OR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.26-0.73; p = .002), and higher ETV sensitivity (OR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.35-0.78; p = .002). Recent tenofovir (TDF) use was associated with K65/K70 mutations (OR = 8.91; 95% CI 5.00-15.85; p < .001). Subtype CRF01_AE was associated with ≥3 N(t)RTI mutations (OR = 2.34; 95% CI 1.31-4.17; p = .004) and higher RPV resistance (OR = 2.13; 95% CI 1.30-3.49; p = .003), and subtype C was associated with <3 TAMs (OR = 0.45; 95% CI 0.21-0.99; p = .015). Subtypes CRF01_AE (OR = 2.46; 95% CI 1.26-4.78; p = .008) and G (OR = 4.77; 95% CI 1.44-15.76; p = .01) were associated with K65/K70 mutations. Higher VL at confirmed first-line VF was associated with ≥3 N(t)RTI mutations (OR = 1.39; 95% CI 1.07-1.78; p = .013) and ≥3 TAMs (OR = 1.62; 95% CI 1.15-2.29; p = .006). The associations of first-line resistance mutations across the HIV-1 subtypes in this study are consistent with knowledge derived from subtype B, with some exceptions. Patterns of resistance after failure of a first-line ta-N(t)RTI regimen support using TDF in N(t)RTI-containing second-line regimens, or using N(t)RTI-sparing regimens."

These patients account for less than 1% of HIV-infected patients. They are defined according to a virological definition: plasma viral load less than 400 copies RNA/ml in more than 90% of the samples tested and HIV positive serology known for more than 10 years. They should never have received antiretroviral therapy. The CD4 T cell count is not taken into account, which differenciate these patients from long-term non progressors. Fifteen patients HIV controllers have been studied in a preliminary work with two main results: i) the demonstration of a strong HIV-specific CD8 immune response and ii) the amount of viral DNA in PBMCs is very low and stable along the time. The aim of the ANRS EP36 study group is to precize the immunological and virological characteristics of these patients. First data seem to confirm an essential role of CD8 T cells to control viral replication, the absence of defective virus, and a normal susceptibility of the CD4 T cells from these patients to the infection with various HIV strains. This group of patients is homogeneous and its study supports physiopathological studies. To go further, a national survey of these patients has been set up to allow future study."
Doc No.408,1184,positive/labeled,9.806961,Low-Frequency Drug Resistance in HIV-Infected Ugandans on Antiretroviral Treatment Is Associated with Regimen Failure.,"Most patients failing antiretroviral treatment in Uganda continue to fail their treatment regimen even if a dominant drug-resistant HIV-1 genotype is not detected. In a recent retrospective study, we observed that approximately 30% of HIV-infected individuals in the Joint Clinical Research Centre (Kampala, Uganda) experienced virologic failure with a susceptible HIV-1 genotype based on standard Sanger sequencing. Selection of minority drug-resistant HIV-1 variants (not detectable by Sanger sequencing) under antiretroviral therapy pressure can lead to a shift in the viral quasispecies distribution, becoming dominant members of the virus population and eventually causing treatment failure. Here, we used a novel HIV-1 genotyping assay based on deep sequencing (DeepGen) to quantify low-level drug-resistant HIV-1 variants in 33 patients failing a first-line antiretroviral treatment regimen in the absence of drug-resistant mutations, as screened by standard population-based Sanger sequencing. Using this sensitive assay, we observed that 64% (21/33) of these individuals had low-frequency (or minority) drug-resistant variants in the intrapatient HIV-1 population, which correlated with treatment failure. Moreover, the presence of these minority HIV-1 variants was associated with higher intrapatient HIV-1 diversity, suggesting a dynamic selection or fading of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants from the viral quasispecies in the presence or absence of drug pressure, respectively. This study identified low-frequency HIV drug resistance mutations by deep sequencing in Ugandan patients failing antiretroviral treatment but lacking dominant drug resistance mutations as determined by Sanger sequencing methods. We showed that these low-abundance drug-resistant viruses could have significant consequences for clinical outcomes, especially if treatment is not modified based on a susceptible HIV-1 genotype by Sanger sequencing. Therefore, we propose to make clinical decisions using more sensitive methods to detect minority HIV-1 variants."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is etiologically associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 80% of cases, and is the dominant cause of death among HBV carriers. Among patients with chronic HBV infection, family history is a known risk factor for the development of HCC; therefore, genetic factors are likely to modify the risk of HCC. However, the genetic factors that determine progression to HCC remain mostly to be investigated. In this review, we discussed that the natural history of HBV infection and host genetic factors related to HCC, study design and target gene selection for the detection of SNPs related to the occurrence of HCC. Also, we reviewed that several SNPs or haplotypes, which were reportedly associated with increased or reduced risk of HCC occurrence in patients with chronic HBV infection. Screening of these polymorphisms might be useful in clinical practice to stratify the lower or higher risk group for HCC and might modify the design of HCC surveillance programs in patients with chronic HBV infection, if further genetic susceptibilities are identified."
Doc No.410,8686,negative/unlabeled,9.797592,HIV-1 LTR DNA sequence variation in brain-derived isolates.,"Isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) derived from the central nervous system (CNS) display properties distinctive from blood-derived isolates, including a high incidence of macrophage tropism in CNS isolates. Macrophage tropism is a result, in part, of DNA sequence variation in the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gene, but evidence also exists suggesting differences in the long terminal repeat (LTR) may contribute to differential gene expression. To investigate the nature of HIV-1 LTR sequence variation in the brain, we have sequenced bases -374 to +43 of the LTR from the brains of four HIV-1-infected patients. A total of 56 clones were derived from either both gray and white matter (three brains) or white matter alone (one brain), and these sequences were compared to 17 published sequences derived from multiple sources. A total of five LTR quasispecies were found. Overall, there was a significant amount of sequence variation both within and between brains, comparable to that seen in quasispecies of the envelope glycoprotein derived from blood or brain. The vast majority of the variation was seen in regions upstream from the two NF-kappa B sites. Compared to the blood-derived, T cell-tropic IIIB LTR, a majority of clones from two or more of the brains shared 11 unique substitutions in transcription factor binding sites, of which eight were shared with the CNS-derived clones JR-CSF and JR-FL and altered the NF-AT and LEF-1 transcription factor binding sites. These findings correlate with published functional studies showing CNS-derived HIV-1 LTRs are distinct from the blood-derived IIIB LTR, and represent a starting point for future studies designed to determine which LTR sequence variations are associated with cell-specific differences in gene expression in the CNS."

By flow cytometry, only 5 of 7 subjects had detectable CD8 T cells that produced IFN-gamma after stimulation with HIV-infected primary CD4 T cells. In 2 subjects, the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing cells increased 4-fold when IL-2 was added to the culture medium; in another subject, IFN-gamma-producing cells could be detected only after IL-2 was added. IFN-gamma-producing cells ranged from 0.4% to 3% of CD8 T cells. Major histocompatibility complex-peptide tetramer staining, which identifies antigen-specific T cells irrespective of function, was used to evaluate the proportion of HIV-specific CD8 T cells that may be nonfunctional in vivo. CD8 T cells binding to tetramers complexed to HIV gag epitope SLYNTVATL and reverse transcriptase epitope YTAFTIPSI were identified in 9 of 15 and 5 of 12 HLA-A2-expressing seropositive subjects at frequencies of 0.1% to 1.1% and 0.1 to 0.7%, respectively. Freshly isolated tetramer-positive cells expressed a mixed pattern of memory and effector markers. On average, IFN-gamma was produced by less than 25% of tetramer-positive CD8 T cells after stimulation with the relevant gag or reverse transcriptase peptide. In all subjects tested, freshly isolated CD8 T cells were not cytolytic against peptide-pulsed B lymphoblastoid cell line or primary HIV-infected CD4 T-cell targets. Exposure to IL-2 enhanced the cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells against primary HIV-infected CD4 targets in 2 of 2 subjects tested. These results suggest that a significant proportion of HIV-specific CD8 T cells may be functionally compromised in vivo and that some function can be restored by exposure to IL-2."
Doc No.412,2504,negative/unlabeled,9.794912,Prevalence of Drug-Resistant Minority Variants in Untreated HIV-1-Infected Individuals With and Those Without Transmitted Drug Resistance Detected by Sanger Sequencing.,"Minority variant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance mutations are associated with an increased risk of virological failure during treatment with NNRTI-containing regimens. To determine whether individuals to whom variants with isolated NNRTI-associated drug resistance were transmitted are at increased risk of virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen, we identified minority variant resistance mutations in 33 individuals with isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance and 49 matched controls. We found similar proportions of overall and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated minority variant resistance mutations in both groups, suggesting that isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance may not be a risk factor for virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen."
Doc No.413,9674,negative/unlabeled,9.786431,Enhancement of TAT-induced transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR by two genomic fragments of HHV-6.,"Clinical and experimental observations suggest that human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), a T-lymphotropic herpesvirus, may act as a cofactor in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Moreover, a possible role of HHV-6 in the increased incidence and severity of cervical carcinoma in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women was suggested by the recent observation that HHV-6 can infect cervical carcinoma cells, accelerating their tumorigenicity in vivo. Therefore, the ability of four HHV-6 genomic clones derived from HHV-6 to transactivate the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV-1 in two cervical carcinoma cell lines and in a T-lymphoid cell line was tested. Two HHV-6 clones, pZVH-14 and pZVB-70, which were previously shown to increase the expression of human papillomavirus (HPV)-transforming genes, were, per se, weak transactivators of the HIV-1 LTR. However, an increased effect occurred when these clones were combined with the HIV-1 transactivator TAT-1. No such effect was seen with two other HHV-6 clones used as controls. Analysis with HIV-1 LTR deletion mutants indicated that this enhancing effect requires the presence of elements contained in both the enhancer region and the TAT activation region (TAR) of HIV-1. This data may have implications for the potential role of HHV-6 in AIDS and AIDS-related cervical carcinoma."

In Cayenne, the mother to child HIV transmission rate was 6% in 2006-2008. Despite free testing and treatment, HIV pregnant women often have delayed or insufficient access to care. The aim of this study was to identify predictive factors of antiretroviral treatment<4 weeks in HIV pregnant women in Cayenne (French Guiana) and then to describe their attitudes, practices, and beliefs regarding HIV/AIDS. A case control study was conducted including all deliveries in Cayenne from 2003 to 2010. For each case, a standardized questionnaire including epidemiological, clinical, and biological data was administered. The analysis first described the summary statistics and then bivariate analysis studied the relation of each variable with the outcome. Multivariate analysis adjusted for the confounding factors. Thirty-three women in the first group and 96 in the control group were included in the study. Women born in French Guiana (OR = 5, IC95% = 1.22-20.86, p=0.027) had a high risk of treatment<4 weeks. The other factors associated with treatment<4 weeks in our study were benefiting from food parcels (OR = 12.72, IC95% = 2.07-78.14, p=0.006), consulting a traditional healer when sick (OR = 9.86, IC95% = 2.57-37.88, p= < 0.001), and drug use (OR = 6.27, IC95% = 1.26-31.13, p=0.025). These predictive factors should be considered in prevention programs against mother to child transmission of HIV."

We investigated adherence to HAART among patients in a clinical cohort study.
Doc No.416,1044,negative/unlabeled,9.767205,Mutually exclusive T-cell receptor induction and differential susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 mutational escape associated with a two-amino-acid difference between HLA class I subtypes.,"The relative contributions of HLA alleles and T-cell receptors (TCRs) to the prevention of mutational viral escape are unclear. Here, we examined human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses restricted by two closely related HLA class I alleles, B*5701 and B*5703, that differ by two amino acids but are both associated with a dominant response to the same HIV-1 Gag epitope KF11 (KAFSPEVIPMF). When this epitope is presented by HLA-B*5701, it induces a TCR repertoire that is highly conserved among individuals, cross-recognizes viral epitope variants, and is rarely associated with mutational escape. In contrast, KF11 presented by HLA-B*5703 induces an entirely different, more heterogeneous TCR beta-chain repertoire that fails to recognize specific KF11 escape variants which frequently arise in clade C-infected HLA-B*5703(+) individuals. These data show the influence of HLA allele subtypes on TCR selection and indicate that extensive TCR diversity is not a prerequisite to prevention of allowable viral mutations."
Doc No.417,1218,negative/unlabeled,9.76353,The NF-kappa B and Sp1 motifs of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat function as novel thyroid hormone response elements.,"We report that thyroid hormone (T3) receptor (T3R) can activate the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR). Purified chick T3R-alpha 1 (cT3R-alpha 1) binds as monomers and homodimers to a region in the LTR (nucleotides -104 to -75 [-104/-75]) which contains two tandem NF-kappa B binding sites and to a region (-80/-45) which contains three Sp1 binding sites. In contrast, human retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR-alpha) and mouse retinoid X receptor beta (RXR-beta) do not bind to these elements. However, RXR-beta binds to these elements as heterodimers with cT3R-alpha 1 and to a lesser extent with RAR-alpha. Gel mobility shift assays also revealed that purified NF-kappa B p50/65 or p50/50 can bind to one but not both NF-kappa B sites simultaneously. Although the binding sites for p50/65, p50/50, and T3R, or Sp1 and T3R, overlap, their binding is mutually exclusive, and with the inclusion of RXR-beta, the major complex is the RXR-beta-cT3R-alpha 1 heterodimer. The NF-kappa B region of the LTR and the NF-kappa B elements from the kappa light chain enhancer both function as T3 response elements (TREs) when linked to a heterologous promoter. The TREs in the HIV-1 NF-kappa B sites appear to be organized as a direct repeat with an 8- or 10-bp gap between the half-sites. Mutations within the NF-kappa B motifs which eliminate binding of cT3R-alpha 1 also abolish stimulation by T3, indicating that cT3R-alpha 1 binding to the Sp1 region does not independently mediate activation by T3. The Sp1 region, however, is converted to a functionally strong TRE by the viral tat factor. These studies indicate that the HIV-1 LTR contains both tat-dependent and tat-independent TREs and reveal the potential for T3R to modulate other genes containing NF-kappa B- and Sp1-like elements. Furthermore, they indicate the importance of other transcription factors in determining whether certain T3R DNA binding sequences can function as an active TRE."

Very poor rates of adherence were found, ranging from 43% (pill count assessment) to 56% (self-report of 3-day adherence to dose). Several factors were associated with nonadherence, including alcohol use, perceived stress, having a partner and age of youngest child, poor self-efficacy to stay with treatment, and poor outcome expectancies regarding the benefits of following the treatment regimen. Interventions to assist these women in improving adherence are urgently needed."
Doc No.419,5096,positive/labeled,9.759607,Psychosocial aspects of antiretroviral medication use among HIV patients.,"This study examines variables related to alteration of antiretroviral medication regimens by HIV infected persons, independent of medical advice. Perceived severity, susceptibility, benefits/barriers, cues to action, and locus of control were included in the analyses. Of 99 subjects, 37 reported discontinuing antiretrovirals on their own initiative and 36 subjects ('fiddlers') reported recent alterations in their medication regimens. Subjects who reported greater perceived barriers and pessimism and less faith in the ability of antiretrovirals to protect them from AIDS related illness were more likely to discontinue drug therapy. Fiddlers were more pessimistic and perceived more barriers to drug therapy than compliers, who believed more in the benefits of antiretrovirals. Fiddlers were significantly more internally oriented than were discontinuers. Compliers were the most optimistic about the effect of antiretrovirals. Even though compliers were more symptomatic than discontinuers, they reported their health status to be better than did discontinuers."
Doc No.420,364,negative/unlabeled,9.739243,Analysis of 3' terminals of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcripts in persistently infected cells.,"To examine the 3' terminal processing of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcripts and the effects of phorbol ester (TPA) on this processing, cellular RNAs from persistently infected T cells (MOLT-4) or promonocytes (U937), with or without TPA treatment, were analyzed. To map the 3' terminals of viral transcripts, the RNA samples were examined by RNase-protection assay with an HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) antisense riboprobe. Without TPA treatment, the viral transcripts initiated at the cap site in 5' LTR and polyadenylated at poly(A) site in 3' LTR were dominantly detected in both types of cells. This analysis demonstrated that some occlusion mechanism inactivating the poly(A) site in 5' LTR might exist in these infected cells. After TPA treatment, we found a dramatic shift in the protected patterns of viral transcripts in MOLT-4 cells, while the shift in U937 cells was less dramatic. These results suggested that the primary factor(s) involved in the observed effect of TPA might be cellular. We also demonstrated that the shift in the protected patterns of viral transcripts was associated with increased steady-state levels of viral transcripts. These results indicated that the factors involved in the TPA-induced shift might have some relation to the trans-activation of HIV-1 by similar substances."
Doc No.421,7856,positive/labeled,9.728074,Microsporidia infection in patients with the human immunodeficiency virus and unexplained cholangitis.,"Cholangitis in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is usually associated with opportunistic infections by cryptosporidium species or cytomegalovirus, but in about a third of cases no opportunistic agent is identified. We suspected some of these cases of biliary disease might be explained by infection with the microsporidia species Enterocytozoon bieneusi, an obligate intracellular protozoan that causes chronic diarrhea in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)."
Doc No.422,8008,negative/unlabeled,9.716893,Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and type 2 Tat function by transdominant Tat protein localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm.,"We introduced various mutations into the activation and RNA binding domains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat in order to develop a novel and potent transdominant Tat protein and to characterize its mechanism of action. The different mutant Tat proteins were characterized for their abilities to activate the HIV LTR and inhibit the function of wild-type Tat in trans. A Tat protein containing a deletion of the basic domain (Tat(delta)49-57) localized exclusively to the cytoplasm of transfected human cells was nonfunctional and inhibited both HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat function in a transdominant manner. Tat proteins containing mutations in the cysteine-rich and core domains were nonfunctional but failed to inhibit Tat function in trans. When Tat nuclear or nucleolar localization signals were fused to the carboxy terminus of Tat(delta)49-57, the chimeric proteins localized to the nucleus or nucleolus, respectively, and remained capable of acting in a transdominant manner. Introduction of secondary mutations in the cysteine-rich and core domains of the various transdominant Tat proteins completely eliminated their abilities to act in a transdominant fashion. Our data best support a mechanism in which these transdominant Tat proteins squelch a cellular factor or factors that interact with the Tat activation domain and are required for Tat to function."
Doc No.423,8263,negative/unlabeled,9.713445,Virus-induced immunosuppression is linked to rapidly fatal disease in infant rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus.,"Six newborn rhesus macaques were experimentally infected with pathogenic Simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac251), and three newborn macaques were infected with avirulent SIVmac1A11. The former developed rapidly fatal simian AIDS and died within 26 wk of age, whereas the latter remained clinically normal. Infant monkeys that developed rapidly progressive disease had rapid declines in CD4+ cells and were unable to mount IgG and IgA antibody responses to SIV or to an unrelated antigen, tetanus toxoid. IgM antibody responses were near normal to both SIV-specific and nonspecific antigens. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses to SIV envelope were observed in animals infected with either virulent or avirulent SIV. These studies demonstrated that virulent SIVmac infection induced a rapid immunosuppression that was both SIV-specific and nonspecific in nature. The observation that virulent strains of SIV can rapidly induce a global immunosuppression provides one explanation for the rapid disease course in some HIV-infected children and supports the strategy of early and vigorous antiviral drug therapy to alter the disease course even if this does not prevent infection."
Doc No.424,548,negative/unlabeled,9.71109,"RANTES and MCP-3 inhibit the replication of T-cell-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strains (SF-2, MN, and HE).","The effects of the C-C chemokines RANTES (regulation upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted) and MCP-3 (monocyte chemotactic protein 3) on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) activated in vitro with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) were investigated. The following T-cell line-tropic (T-tropic) HIV strains were tested: HIV type 1 (HIV-1) SF-2, HIV-1 IIIB, HIV-1 MN, HIV-1 NDK, HIV-1 HE, HIV-1 NL4-3, HIV-2 ROD, and HIV-2 EHO. The strain most sensitive to the antiviral effects of RANTES and MCP-3 appeared to be HIV-1 SF-2. A 50% inhibitory concentration for HIV-1 SF-2 of 4 ng of RANTES per ml was obtained, and that of MCP-3 was about 1 ng/ml. However, MCP-3 was inactive at 100 ng/ml. Other HIV-1 strains, such as MN and HE, were less sensitive to the antiviral effects of RANTES and MCP-3, whereas all the other HIV strains tested were insensitive. Although the ratio of CD3+ CD4+ to CD3+ CD8+ T cells was the same in HIV-infected PBMC cultures treated or untreated with the chemokines, RANTES and MCP-3 interfered with the binding of monoclonal antibody (MAb) OKT4 to the CD4 receptor on T cells but not with the binding of MAb OKT4A. Therefore, RANTES and MCP-3 not only interfere with the HIV-induced fusion process but also have some modulating effect on the CD4 cell receptor. The chemokines did not affect HIV-1 binding to PHA-stimulated PBMC. Taken together, our observations point to the important role that both RANTES and MCP-3 may play in inhibiting HIV-1 replication of certain T-tropic strains in primary PBMC cultures. This may have important implications for immunotherapeutic strategies designed to slow down disease progression in AIDS."
Doc No.425,8,negative/unlabeled,9.709829,CD8low T-cell subpopulation is increased in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection.,"Recent studies suggest that CD8(+) T cells with down-regulated CD8 expression (CD3(+)CD8(low) T cells) represented as a distinct phenotype of CD8(+) T cells are increased and linked to disease severity in some chronically persistent infection, such as chronic HIV and parasite infection. However, the role of CD3(+)CD8(low) T cells in the context of chronic HBV infection is poorly understood. In this study, peripheral blood samples of 47 chronic hepatitis B patients and 19 healthy controls were collected and tested for the frequency and phenotype of CD8(low) T cells. The circulating CD8(low) T cells were significantly more frequent in the patients compared to those in healthy controls, and the CD8(low) T cells in the patients expressed less IFN-γ and more mTGF-β1 than those in the controls, suggesting their type-2 polarized and suppressive properties. Meanwhile, the concentrations of plasma soluble HLA class I molecules were found elevated in the patients, and positively associated with the frequencies of CD8(low) T cells. Furthermore, the CD8(low) T-cell frequency in the HLA-A2-positive patients (n=21) was found negatively correlated with the T-cell responsiveness against the HBc₁₈₋₂₇ peptide, the latter was impaired as revealed by IFN-γ Elispot assay. Our findings suggested that a better understanding of the involvement of CD8(low) T cells in chronically persistent HBV infection would add to our knowledge of the impaired T-cell response in the patients."
Doc No.426,6181,negative/unlabeled,9.697486,Maraviroc: perspectives for use in antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected patients.,"Maraviroc (Pfizer's UK-427857, Selzentry or Celsentri outside the USA) is the first agent in the new class of oral HIV-1 entry inhibitors to acquire approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency. Considering the mechanism of action, it is expected that this drug will be effective only in a subpopulation of HIV-1-infected people, namely those harbouring the R5 virus. The favourable toxicity profile of the drug has been demonstrated in Phase III clinical trials in treatment-naive (MERIT) and treatment-experienced (MOTIVATE) patients. In the latter population, maraviroc showed a superior antiviral efficacy and immunological activity compared with optimized backbone therapy + placebo. However, in MERIT, a prospective double-blind, randomized trial in treatment-naive patients, maraviroc + zidovudine/lamivudine failed to prove non-inferiority to efavirenz + zidovudine/lamivudine as standard of care regimen in the 48 week intention-to-treat analysis. Using an assay with higher sensitivity for minority CXCR4-using (X4) HIV variants (the enhanced Trofile assay-Monogram), non-inferiority was reached for the maraviroc- versus efavirenz-based combination. These data indicate the important impact of the sensitivity of tropism testing on treatment outcome of maraviroc-containing regimens. This paper discusses both the prospective and retrospective analyses of the MERIT data and highlights the impact of these results on daily practice in HIV care."
Doc No.427,9670,negative/unlabeled,9.696601,Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.,"Gilead Sciences is developing a fixed-dose co-formulation of two of its reverse transcriptase inhibitors, emtricitabine [Emtriva] and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Viread], for once-daily dosing in combination with other antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV infection. Each co-formulated tablet will contain 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 200 mg of emtricitabine. Emtricitabine [Emtriva] is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with demonstrated potent activity against HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). It was first approved in the US by the FDA in July 2003 and is indicated for adults aged > or =18 years. Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established. In antiretroviral-treatment-experienced patients, the use of emtricitabine may be considered for adults with HIV strains that are expected to be susceptible to the drug as assessed by genotypic or phenotypic testing. The recommended dose of emtricitabine is one 200 mg capsule daily, with or without food. In the European Union, emtricitabine is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV in adults and children, where it is also licensed as an oral 10 mg/mL solution. The oral solution is for use in infants older than 4 months, children and patients unable to swallow hard capsules, and patients with renal impairment who require dose reduction. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Viread] is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced patients. The drug was first approved in the US in October 2001, followed by further approvals in the European Union, Australia, Iceland, Brazil, Canada and Switzerland. The drug has been launched in all these countries. In February 2003, the EMEA's advisory committee adopted a positive opinion to extend the indication of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in all 15 member states to include the product's use in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients. In July 2003, Japan Tobacco signed an agreement with Gilead for the commercialisation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine and the future co-formulation of these two drugs within Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, Japan Tobacco will be submitting an application to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for regulatory approval of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine. On 15 March 2004, Gilead announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the US FDA and a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the EMEA for marketing approval of the fixed-dose co-formulation of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. The MAA will be reviewed under the centralised procedure, which, when finalised, will provide one marketing authorisation in all 25 member states of the enlarged European Union. Gilead anticipates launching the combination pill on the US market early in 2005. Regulatory filings for marketing approval in Japan by Japan Tobacco are also expected during 2004. In August 2003, Gilead announced that enrollment had begun in a 48-week phase III study (Study 934) evaluating the efficacy of a once-daily regimen of Viread and Emtriva versus Combivir. The open-label, multicentre trial will enroll up to 500 treatment-naive, HIV-infected patients in the US and Europe. Patients in one arm will receive Viread 300 mg, Emtriva 200mg and efavirenz 600 mg once daily. Patients in the comparator arm will receive Combivir) (lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg) twice daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily."
Doc No.428,6094,negative/unlabeled,9.69202,Pneumocystis carinii infection in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients.,"Pneumocystis carinii is a ubiquitous, atypical unicellular fungus. P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, and is the leading complication in advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Many different host (mammal)-specific species of Pneumocystis exist, but the life-cycle is not understood fully. Human strains are designated as P. carinii f. sp. (special form) hominis (at least 59 different types). P. carinii is spread via the airborne route. Disease is most frequently caused by fresh exposure to a source of P. carinii, rather than by reactivation of latent infection. Asymptomatic carriage among healthy persons may occur. PCP occurs in HIV-infected patients when the CD4+ count falls below a certain threshold; organisms multiply and gradually fill the alveoli. Symptoms, which include a mildly productive cough, progressive dyspnoea and fever, may persist for months prior to diagnosis. Without treatment, progressive respiratory insufficiency invariably ends in death. Pulmonary specimens may be obtained by procedures of varying sensitivity and risk. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by detection of stained organisms; however, staining procedures vary in sensitivity and ease of use. Robust polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols with good predictive results may be useful in the future. Therapy falls into two categories: for acute primary infections and for prophylaxis. A confirmed diagnosis ensures that patients do not receive potentially toxic medication (adverse drug reactions can occur). Prophylaxis can dramatically reduce the frequency of PCP in HIV patients, and its more widespread use should lead to a decline in the incidence of PCP in the future."

We performed a retrospective study of treated HIV-infected patients with stable detectable viral replication (<10000 copies/mL [low-level viremia]) and compared their clinical, virologic and immunologic courses with those of treated patients with undetectable viremia and viremia (>or=10000 copies/mL [high-level viremia]). Viral reverse transcriptase and protease genotype and HIV-specific CD4 T-cell responses were determined using patient-derived samples. Clinical and immunologic benefits were maintained in patients with partial virologic suppression (<or=10000 copies/mL). Although low-level viral replication under drug pressure led to the accumulation of resistance mutations in most subjects' viruses, most subjects retained susceptibility to drugs in >or=2 classes of antiretroviral medications. HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell immunity was detected in most subjects with low-level and undetectable viremia and may have a role in controlling viremia in the setting of partial suppression."
Doc No.430,6381,negative/unlabeled,9.684176,Application of biosafety principles in blood establishments.,"In light of increasing public and employee concern over potential infectious hazards associated with blood and other body fluids, several government agencies (the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Health Care Financing Administration and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute) cosponsored a Biosafety Workshop in April 1988. The objective of the workshop was to identify appropriate biosafety practices and standard control procedures to protect workers involved in the collection, storage, and transportation of human blood donations with the least possible disruption of the nation's blood supply. Speakers focused on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV); however, the safety principles discussed were considered equally applicable to other known (e.g., non-A, non-B hepatitis and human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) blood-transmitted infections. The resulting consensus included the need for blood establishments to develop and apply thoughtful biosafety programs to address staff training, accident prevention, HBV vaccination, handling spills, managing contaminated waste and transporting blood specimens. There was lack of agreement, however, on the usefulness of gloves during the phlebotomy of healthy blood donors."
Doc No.431,8913,positive/labeled,9.679897,Prevalence and pattern of drug resistance mutations among antiretroviral-treated HIV-1 patients with suboptimal virological response in Malaysia.,"To assess the prevalence of major drug resistance mutations in antiretroviral (ARV)-treated patients with detectable viral load (VL) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, genotypic resistance testing was performed among treated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) patients attending the University Malaya Medical Center between July 2003 and November 2004. The reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes from 36 plasma samples with detectable VL were examined for major mutations associated with ARV resistance as reported by the International AIDS Society-USA Drug Resistance Mutations Group. The prevalence of patients with at least one major mutation conferring drug resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), non-NRTIs (NNRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs) was 77.8%. In the RT gene, the frequency of mutations associated with NRTIs and NNRTIs resistance was 52.8 and 63.9%, respectively, with M184V and K103N mutations being selected most frequently by these drugs. A patient with Q151M mutation complex was also detected. Twenty-two percent of the patients had mutations associated with PIs. The following pattern of prevalence of ARV-resistant HIV-1 variants was observed: NNRTI-resistant > NRTI-resistant > PI-resistant. The prevalence of major drug resistance mutations among ARV-treated patients with detectable VL is high in Kuala Lumpur. Genotypic drug resistance testing is therefore important for monitoring patients experiencing ARV regimen failure."

Seven candidate polymorphisms (rs3842 and rs1045642 in ABCB1, rs212091 and rs3743527 in ABCC1, rs3745274 in CYP2B6, rs628031 in SLC22A1 and rs1517618 in SLCO3A1) were evaluated if they were associated with virological failure through logistic regression analysis. The study design was a retrospective cohort, analyzing 187 patients from Recife metropolitan region (Pernambuco, Brazil): among these 160 obtained complete suppression of HIV-1 replication (responders) and were compared to 27 non-responders, which underwent virological failure. There was no association between CYP2B6, SLC22A1, and SLCO3A1 SNPs and virological failure. Using logistic regression analysis, a significant association was detected between rs1045642 (3435C>T, ABCB1) and rs212091 (198217T>C; 3'-UTR, ABCC1) with virological failure of first-line antiretroviral regimens containing protease inhibitors, when controlled by clinical factors, such as sex, age and race. The present results could contribute to unravel the influence of genetic background in anti-HIV-1 therapy outcome and help in treatment personalization of Northeast Brazil HIV infected patients. "
Doc No.433,3436,negative/unlabeled,9.669176,Resistance profiles to antiretroviral drugs in HIV-1 drug-naive patients in Argentina.,"The drug resistance profile of treatment-naive HIV-infected individuals living in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was studied. Samples taken from 94 drug-naive individuals with established HIV infection and 13 patients with primary HIV infection were assessed by nucleotide sequencing and LIPA. The prevalence of drug-associated primary mutations in individuals with established infection was very low. In the viral protease region, 1/86 (1.2%) individuals carried the D30N mutation, whereas 1/85 (1.2%) had the M41L mutation in the reverse transcriptase (RT) region. Secondary mutations in both the protease and RT regions were found in almost 90% of the individuals. In individuals with primary infection, primary mutations were detected in 2/13 (15.4%) patients, one of them carrying M461 mutation in the protease while the other patient had a mutation at codon 184 of the RT. In accordance with current drug resistance testing guidelines, the results of this study suggest that susceptibility tests need not be performed at this time prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected people in Argentina. However, the public health implications of this subject warrant follow-up studies that will examine a larger number of drug-naive patients, not only in Buenos Aires but also in other major Argentinian cities and in rural areas."

The faith-based organisation, Gospel Health and Development Services, provides a home-based care programme for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) residing in Plateau State, Nigeria. This paper assesses the challenges that PLWHA in the programme faced while maintaining their health and livelihoods. The frustrations that volunteers endured in performing their work are also described, as well as the benefits and weaknesses of the programme from the perspective of PLWHA and their volunteer caregivers. Focus groups and interviews were done with 30 PLWHA and 22 volunteers to learn about their experiences with the home-based care programme and possible areas for its improvement. From these discussions three major challenges facing PLWHA emerged: discrimination towards PLWHA; the lack of money, food, and transport to health-care centres; and the desire for closer antiretroviral drug access."

A key factor in the effectiveness of ART is good adherence to the prescribed regimen for both individual well-being and public health. Poor adherence can contribute to the emergence of drug resistant strains of the virus and transmission during risky behaviors. Increased access to ART in low-income country settings has contributed to an interest in treatment adherence in resource-poor contexts. This study aims to investigate the proportion of adherence to ART and identify possible factors related to non-adherence to ART among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Lao PDR."
Doc No.436,9004,negative/unlabeled,9.658253,Risk factors of hepatitis B virus infection in children.,"Hepatitis B infection (HBV) is prevalent worldwide. Overall prevalence is about 3 percent in Bangladesh. Treatments of chronic HBV infection by antiviral drugs are costly and outcome of treatment is also restricted. Therefore risk factors identification is the logical & rational approach to prevent HBV infection. This case control study aimed to find out certain risk factors related to HBV infection in children. It was conducted on patients attending the Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition and Department of Virology of BSMMU and Khidmah Hospital, Dhaka. A total of one hundred cases and one hundred suitably matched controls were studied between October 2007 to May 2009.Variables used for the purpose of the study were younger age,  use of mosquito nets, history of undergoing surgical procedures, history of taking intravenous drug and blood transfusion, maternal infection, dental procedures and abrasion during hair cut in barber shops. Chi-square test   was done to measure the level of significance. Odds ratio was calculated to correlate the disease risk. Backward conditional logistic regression was also done for multivariate analysis. The study result showed that the frequency of HBV infection among the study population was higher (62.0%) among children of 7 to 12 years age group. In younger age group (0-6 years) prevalence was 18.0%. Respondents who did not use mosquito net during sleep on a regular basis had higher risk of developing HBV infection than those who used it regularly (p value 0.028). Children who underwent surgical procedures for any reason were significantly associated with HBV infection (p value 0.005). Intravenous drug use (p value 0.001), mother to child transmission (p value 0.001) and history of abrasion during hair cut in barber shops (p value 0.04) were also identified as significant risk factors. No significant association was observed with blood transfusion (p value 0.138) and dental procedures (p value 0.315). From this study it may be concluded that irregular use of mosquito nets, history of surgical procedures, history of parenteral medication, transmission from infected mothers and abrasion during hair cut in barber shops are the probable important risk factors of HBV infection in children."
Doc No.437,4579,negative/unlabeled,9.6570635,Hepatitis B virus antiviral drug resistance: from the laboratory to the patient.,"The development and application of nucleoside (and nucleotide) analogues for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection will transform the management of this condition. For instance, treatment with lamivudine effects a dramatic and measurable reduction of serum virus titre. This is associated with biochemical and histological improvements. Unfortunately, for the majority, replication resumes when treatment is withdrawn. Prolonged lamividine treatment may be associated with the emergence of drug-resistant species with specific polymerase mutations. Compared with the observed rate for the development of drug resistance observed during monotherapy of HIV infection, resistance is slow to emerge during treatment of hepatitis B. The rate of emergence might be dependent on the rate of infected hepatocyte turnover, which is extremely variable in chronic HBV infection (and significantly slower than infected lymphocyte turnover during HIV infection). Preliminary data suggest that pretreatment serum virus titre may be an important predictor of the development of drug resistance, an observation consistent with preexistance of the resistant virus in the hepatitis B virus quasispecies. Akin to developments in antiviral treatment of HIV infection, further progress in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B will depend on the development of drugs for use in combination therapy."

We retrospectively evaluated the impact of IL28B SNPs and other factors on SVR in a cohort of 102 HIV-1/HCV-coinfected patients treated with pegylated interferon-? (peg-INF?) and ribavirin. Data on baseline features and virological response at different time-points were collected. Overall, 89/102 patients (87%) were males, 44 (43%) of whom infected with HCV genotype 1; SVR was achieved by 50 patients (49%). A univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that rs129679860 SNP genotype CC (p<0.034), rs8099917 SNP genotype TT (p<0.01), HCV genotype 2 or 3 (p<0.0001), low HCV viral load (p<0.028) and RVR (rapid virological response) (p<0.0001) were associated with a higher likelihood of SVR. Multivariate analysis confirmed only RVR and HCV genotype as independent predictors of SVR. In a real life setting, the importance of RVR and IL28B SNPs was confirmed as predictive of SVR to identify patients with a higher likelihood of SVR to Peg-INF?+RBV, and also to designate a deferred therapy for patients with a low likelihood of SVR for whom it is preferable to wait for more successful options.

We used the data from a 5-year longitudinal study of the MANIF 2000 cohort of individuals infected with HIV (as a result of injection drug use) and receiving HAART to investigate the predictors of long-term virological success. Design. Data were collected every 6 months from outpatient hospital services delivering HIV care in France. We selected all patients who were receiving HAART for at least 6 months (baseline visit) and who had indications for OST (ie, still dependent on opioids). We selected a total of 113 patients, accounting for a total of 562 visits for all the analyses."
Doc No.440,4393,negative/unlabeled,9.648354,Prevalence of transmitted HIV drug resistance since the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy.,"We investigated the prevalence of HIV-1-associated transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in Victoria from the time of first availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Drug resistance genotyping was performed on virus present in blood samples collected from individuals with serologically confirmed primary infection, between 1996 and 2007. The significance of any mutations detected was interpreted according to a standardised list of drug resistance mutations. The main outcomes measured were the prevalence by year of TDR to any antiretroviral drug class, the numbers of infected individuals with TDR involving multiple drug classes, and the resistance mutations implicated in all cases. There was an average annual prevalence of TDR of 16%, predominantly associated with nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors and most commonly occurring at codons 41, 103 and 215 in the RT. The prevalence of thymidine-associated mutations remained high throughout the period of study. While mutations known to cause resistance to protease inhibitors were uncommon, they were present in several individuals infected with virus resistant to multiple drug classes. The prevalence of TDR in Victoria is similar to geographical locations outside Australia where HIV-specific drug treatment is widely available. Primary infection with drug resistant HIV is a future treatment issue for the individual patient and for the wider population at risk of infection. At this time TDR shows no sign of waning and our data support recent treatment guidelines recommending baseline testing for TDR before therapy is initiated."
Doc No.441,6890,positive/labeled,9.645122,Development of oral lesions in human immunodeficiency virus-infected transfusion recipients and hemophiliacs.,"The authors used multivariate repeated-measures transition models to identify risk factors for two oral lesions related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-candidiasis and hairy leukoplakia-in 152 HIV-infected blood transfusion recipients and hemophiliacs. Subjects were examined for occurrences of these lesions every 6 months from July 1985 through March 1993, yielding 1,076 study visits. It was found that, after adjustment for the CD4:CD8 T-lymphocyte ratio, patients with a history of candidiasis in the previous 18 months were at high risk of lesion recurrence. This risk increased with the number of prior episodes and with the recency of the episode(s). A history of hairy leukoplakia was less predictive of persistence of that lesion after adjustment for significant risk factors (including candidiasis and use of antifungal agents at the current examination, a low CD4:CD8 cell ratio, and age less than 40 years). The authors also found a high coprevalence of candidiasis and hairy leukoplakia in these subjects. These results suggest that HIV-infected patients with oral candidiasis should be carefully monitored for subsequent episodes over the next 12-18 months, and patients with either oral candidiasis or hairy leukoplakia and a low CD4:CD8 cell ratio should be carefully examined for the other type of lesion as well."

The incidence of clinically overt toxoplasmosis was about 20% in the 167 hospitalized persons infected with the parasite. In 29% of 68 patients with suspected pneumocystosis, the infection could be verified. In 9% of 219 patients, Cryptosporidium sp. was found. In two persons, an infection with Strongyloides stercoralis was diagnosed. Except these AIDS-associated opportunistic infections, the incidence of parasitic infections in the Austrian HIV-infected population was found to be low, and, except for Entamoeba histolytica, not significantly exceeding the frequency of parasitic infections in non-HIV-infected Austrians. Compared to data on the frequency of opportunistic infections in AIDS-patients in other developed countries, toxoplasmosis as well as infections with Cryptosporidium sp. seem to be more often diagnosed in Austria, whereas pneumocystosis is slightly less frequently found."

Optimal anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence is essential for maximal suppression of viral replication and long term survival of patients. In order to develop effective public health interventions in the context of scaling ART services to peripheral areas, it is important to evaluate factors associated with non-adherence among HIV-infected individuals in Pwani Region. The purpose of this study was to identify factors related to non-adherence to ART among HIV infected people in Pwani Region eastern of Tanzania. A case-control study was carried out at Tumbi Hospital and Chalinze Health Centre in Pwani Region in eastern Tanzania. A structured questionnaire was used to assess non-adherence and adherence to doses instruction and time schedule. Patients with less than 95% adherence were defined as cases while those with more than 95% adherence became controls. A structured questionnaire containing factors known to be associated with non-adherence to ART in similar settings was administered. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with non-adherence. A total of 79 cases and 237 controls matched by age and sex were studied. A high proportion of cases and controls (77.2% and 84.8%) had good knowledge ofART benefits, adherence and eligibility. Majority of cases (73.3%) and controls (69.2%) used public transport to access ART services. More than half of cases (53.2%) missed clinic appointments due to lack of bus fare or other reasons and was associated with ART non adherence (mOR 4.2, 95%CI, 2.2-8.1 and 2.1,95%CI 1.2-4.2). Disclosure to confidants only and failure to disclose HIV-test positive status were associated with non adherence (mOR 3.3, 95%CI 1.3-8.5 and 2.3, 95%CI 1.2-7.1). Alcohol use was associated with non adherence to ART (mOR 1.9, 95%CI 1.4-3.7). Patients who were not satisfied with providers were more likely to be non adherence to ART (mOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.2-3.8). In conclusion, these findings show that adherence is a process which is depended on local specific adherence factors. Adherence improvement strategies need to consider site specific adherence determinants, patient experiences and concerns."

Doc No.445,6070,negative/unlabeled,9.609448,Virological outcome after structured interruption of antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus infection is associated with the functional profile of virus-specific CD8+ T cells.,"A clear understanding of the antiviral effects of CD8(+) T cells in the context of chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is critical for the development of prophylactic vaccines and therapeutics designed to support T-cell-mediated immunity. However, defining the potential correlates of effective CD8(+) T-cell immunity has proven difficult; notably, comprehensive analyses have demonstrated that the size and shape of the CD8(+) T-cell response are not necessarily indicative of efficacy determined by measures of plasma viral load. Here, we conducted a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of CD8(+) T-cell responses to autologous virus in a cohort of six HIV-infected individuals with a history of structured interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (SIT). The magnitude and breadth of the HIV-specific response did not, by themselves, explain the changes observed in plasma virus levels after the cessation of ART. Furthermore, mutational escape from targeted epitopes could not account for the differential virological outcomes in this cohort. However, the functionality of HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations upon antigen encounter, determined by the simultaneous and independent measurement of five CD8(+) T-cell functions (degranulation and gamma interferon, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-2 levels) reflected the emergent level of plasma virus, with multiple functions being elicited in those individuals with lower levels of viremia after SIT. These data show that the quality of the HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell response, rather than the quantity, is associated with the dynamics of viral replication in the absence of ART and suggest that the effects of SIT can be assessed by measuring the functional profile of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells."
Doc No.446,4219,negative/unlabeled,9.608898,Early diagnosis and immunologic changes in HIV-1 infected pregnant women and their children.,"The diagnosis of HIV infection in pregnant women is usually based on the detection of HIV-specific antibodies. These tests become positive a few weeks to months after infection. In the United States, it is recommended that tests be offered to all women and encouraged where the rate of infection is > or = 1/1,000 or the woman is at increased risk for infection. The great majority of infected pregnant women are asymptomatic, and questioning patients about risk behavior will identify only about one-half of the infected women. In Washington, D.C. about 1.5% of the pregnant women who reside in the city are HIV positive. The diagnosis of HIV in the child in the first month of life is difficult and requires the use of polymerase chain reaction tests and/or culture. Other tests become positive later. Immunological tests in most HIV-infected mothers in the USA are normal; however, about 12% of patients are symptomatic and show decreased CD4 T cell counts and 6% have AIDS. These patients may have other evidence of decreased T cell responses and are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. At birth, almost all children of HIV-infected mothers have normal immunological findings. However, about 50 of these children become ill by 1 year of age and many develop decreased T cell counts and other immunological changes."
Doc No.447,5847,positive/labeled,9.602604,Clinical relevance of substitutions in the connection subdomain and RNase H domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from a cohort of antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients.,"Some mutations in the connection subdomain of the polymerase domain and in the RNase H domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) have been shown to contribute to resistance to RT inhibitors. However, the clinical relevance of such mutations is not well understood. To address this point we determined the prevalence of such mutations in a cohort of antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients (n=123) and assessed whether these substitutions are associated with drug resistance in vitro and in vivo. We report here significant differences in the prevalence of substitutions among subtype B, and non-subtype B HIV isolates. Specifically, the E312Q, G333E, G335D, V365I, A371V and A376S substitutions were present in 2-6% of subtype B, whereas the G335D and A371V substitutions were commonly observed in 69% and 75% of non-B HIV-1 isolates. We observed a significant decline in the viral loads of patients that were infected with HIV-1 carrying these substitutions and were subsequently treated with triple drug regimens, even in the case where zidovudine (AZT) was included in such regimens. We show here that, generally, such single substitutions at the connection subdomain or RNase H domain have no influence on drug susceptibility in vitro by themselves. Instead, they generally enhance AZT resistance in the presence of excision-enhancing mutations (EEMs, also known as thymidine analogue-associated mutations, TAMs). However, N348I, A376S and Q509L did confer varying amounts of nevirapine resistance by themselves, even in the absence of EEMs. Our studies indicate that several connection subdomain and RNase H domain substitutions typically act as pre-therapy polymorphisms."
Doc No.448,8471,positive/labeled,9.599811,Characteristics of nausea reported by HIV-infected patients initiating combination antiretroviral regimens.,"Reliable data on the incidence and severity of nausea accompanying combination antiretroviral therapies is lacking. A prospective time series design was used to assess the rate, severity, and distress of nausea in a cohort of 75 HIV-positive patients who were beginning or changing a combination of two or more antiretroviral medications. Data were collected via telephone at weekly intervals for 12 weeks. The rate of nausea across regimens was greatest at Week 1 (39%) and declined progressively over time. By Week 12, the rate of nausea was only 5%. Severity of nausea was ranked as moderate or severe by a substantial proportion of patients through Week 10; however, nausea severity and distress were also found to diminish over time. The nausea associated with combination antiretroviral therapy is quite common and may adversely affect medication adherence. Findings indicate that clinicians should consider initiating interventions for management of antiretroviral-related nausea at baseline."
Doc No.449,9798,negative/unlabeled,9.596303,The role of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in the therapy of HIV-1 infection.,"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have, in addition to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs), gained a definitive place in the treatment of HIV-1 infections. Starting from the HEPT and TIBO derivatives, more than 30 structurally different classes of compounds have been identified as NNRTIs, that is compounds that are specifically inhibitory to HIV-1 replication and targeted at the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Two NNRTIs (nevirapine and delavirdine) have been formally licensed for clinical use and several others are in preclinical or clinical development [thiocarboxanilide UC-781, HEPT derivative MKC-442, quinoxaline HBY 097 and DMP 266 (efavirenz)]. The NNRTIs interact with a specific 'pocket' site of HIV-1 RT that is closely associated with, but distinct from, the NRTI binding site. NNRTIs are notorious for rapidly eliciting resistance due to mutations of the amino acids surrounding the NNRTI-binding site. However, the emergence of resistant HIV strains can be circumvented if the NNRTIs, alone or in combination, are used from the start at sufficiently high concentrations. In vitro, this procedure has proved to 'knock-out' virus replication and to prevent resistance from arising. In vivo, various triple-drug combinations of NNRTIs (nevirapine, delavirdine or efavirenz) with NRTIs (AZT, 3TC, ddI or d4T) and/or PIs (indinavir or nelfinavir) have been shown to afford a durable anti-HIV activity, as reflected by both a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and increased CD4 T-lymphocyte counts."
Doc No.450,2003,negative/unlabeled,9.5959635,Prevalence of drug-resistance-associated mutations in antiretroviral drug-naive Zambians infected with subtype C HIV-1.,"The ability of HIV-1 to evolve resistance to antiretroviral drugs leads to treatment failure. By nucleotide sequencing of HIV-1 subtype B isolates, amino acids responsible for drug resistance have been identified. Less information is available, however, on the extent and distribution of these amino acids in HIV-1 nonsubtype B viruses circulating mainly in developing countries. More HIV-infected patients in the developing world are now using antiretroviral drugs, and hence there is a need to monitor drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 non-subtype B viruses. This study examines the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in 28 antiretroviral drug-naive HIV-1-infected Zambians. HIV-1 proviral DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The region encompassing gag p17 to env C2-V3-C3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing. Sequence analyses for drug resistance-associated mutations in th e protease and reverse transcriptase genes, and HIV-1 subtyping, were done. Overall, 92.8% of the generated sequences were HIV-1 subtype C. The generated sequences revealed only secondary associated, but no primary, drug-resistance mutations The most frequent secondary mutations in the protease and RT genes were, respectively, I93L(91.7%), L89M (79.2%), M3611V (79%, 4.2%), and R211K (70.8%), S48T (62.5%). The atypical residues M41N (3.6%) and D67A (3.6%) were detected in the RT gene. This study reveals many naturally occurring polymorphisms in HIV-1 subtype C isolates from antiretroviral drug-naive individuals. Such polymorphisms could lead to rapid treatment failure and development of drug-resistant HIV-1 mutants in individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy."

We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess virological response and resistance development from ART patients. Between 2006 and 2008, blood was collected from 143 ART patients. Viral load (VL) was determined with a detection limit of 50 copies/ml; those with detectable VL were genotyped with dried plasma spots using a broadly sensitive genotyping assay. Resistance mutations were identified using the Stanford HIV drug resistance database. Of the 143 patients, 72% [95% confidence interval (CI): 65.9-78.2] suppressed their VL to <50 copies/ml. Genotyping analysis of the remaining 40 patients revealed that 21 (53%, CI: 37.0-68.0) harbored one or more mutations. The most common mutations were thymidine-analog mutations (22.5%) and M184V (10%) to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and V106I/A /M (17.5%), Y181C (15%), and H221Y (12.5%) to non-NRTIs (NNRTIs); 13 patients had mutations to both NRTIs and NNRTIs. Patients with VL >1000 copies/ml appear to harbor more mutations than those with VL between 50 and 1000 (62.1% vs. 27.3%, p>0.05). Resistance mutations were intensified among 10 patients for whom two sequential specimens were obtained and accumulation of resistance mutations predicted compromised treatment outcomes and future drug selections. This study provides a snapshot of the virological responses and resistance profiles for patients on first-line regimens, indicating that patient monitoring is a critical component in preventing the accumulation of resistance mutations among patients failing their regimens and thus maintaining the effectiveness of the first-line regimens."
Doc No.452,8846,negative/unlabeled,9.58529,Studies on the production of IL-15 in HIV-infected/AIDS patients.,"IL-15 is essential for the development and differentiation of NK cells. It selectively induces proliferation of CD8+ memory T lymphocytes. Despite its importance in both innate and adaptive immune responses, little is known about its production in HIV-infected persons. We report here that IL-15 levels are significantly decreased in the sera of HIV-infected/AIDS patients compared to control sera. We also show that PBMC from the infected patients are compromised in their ability to respond with enhanced production of IL-15 upon exposure to HSV-1. The decreased production of IL-15 occurs despite a comparable increase in IL-15 mRNA in the PBMC of HIV-infected and healthy HIV-seronegative donors when exposed to HSV-1. The HSV-stimulated patients' PBMC exhibited less NK activity compared to similarly treated normal PBMC. These results suggest that a compromised ability of PBMC from HIV-infected individuals to induce IL-15 production in response to a viral stimulus may be a reason of their compromised innate and adaptive immunity."

Infection of CD3+ CD8+ CD45RA+ cells was detected in 9 of 16 study subjects at frequencies ranging from 30 to 1,400 proviral copies/10(6) cells, more frequently than CD3+ CD8+ lymphocytes expressing the RO isoform of CD45 (n = 2, 70 and 260 copies /10(6) cells). In agreement with previous studies, there was no evidence for a similar preferential infection of CD4+ naive lymphocytes. Proviral sequences in both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte subsets were complete, as assessed by quantitation using primers from the long terminal repeat region spanning the tRNA primer binding site. In six of the seven study subjects investigated, variants infecting CD8+ lymphocytes were partially or completely genetically distinct in the V3 region from those recovered from CD4+ lymphocytes and showed a greater degree of compartmentalization than observed between naive and memory subsets of CD4+ lymphocytes. In two study subjects, arginine substitutions at position 306, associated with use of the chemokine coreceptor CXCR4, were preferentially found in CD4 lymphocytes. These population differences may have originated through different times of infection rather than necessarily indicating a difference in their biological properties. The preferential distribution of HIV-1 in naive CD8+ lymphocytes indeed suggests that infection occurred early in T-lymphocyte ontogeny, such as during maturation in the thymus. Destruction of cells destined to become CD8+ lymphocytes may be a major factor in the decline in CD8+ lymphocyte frequencies and function on disease progression and may contribute directly to the observed immunodeficiency in AIDS."

These tests are based on bulk population sequencing and thus consider only variants representing more than 20% of the viral population, whereas next generation sequencing methods allow detection below this threshold. We aimed to evaluate the potential use of ultradeep pyrosequencing (UDPS) for genotypic resistance testing in clinical routine at the University Hospital of Bordeaux, France. We performed UDPS on reverse transcriptase (RT) from 47 HIV-1 individuals, naive of antiretroviral treatment and for whom genotypic resistance testing was requested for clinical management in 2011-2012. In 8.5% of the patients, only low-frequency variants harboring RT drug resistance mutations were detected raising the question of their clinical significance. Rilpivirine-associated resistance mutations were detected in 19.1% of our population study. To conclude, UDPS could become a routine tool for the evaluation of HIV-infected patients in hospital laboratories."

In the final multivariate model, illicit drug use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-5.07), previous abandon of medication (AOR 38.6; 95% CI 10.49-142.25), last CD4 count <200 cells/mm(3) (AOR 1.5; 95% CI 1.03-2.10), and viral load higher than 1000 copies/mL (AOR 2.0 (95% CI 1.34-3.09) were independent predictors of abandonment of ART. In addition to the clinical indicators, behavioral factors remained important throughout the multivariate analysis in our study."

Of the 55 subjects studied, major mutations conferring HIV drug resistance were present in 10 (18%). Eight (15%) had nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations, with the majority (6) having the K103N mutation; 2 (4%) had nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutations; and 2 (4%) had protease inhibitor (PI) mutations. Phenotypic drug resistance was present in 12 (22%) subjects: 10 (18%) for NNRTIs, 2 (4%) for NRTIs, and 3 (5.5%) for PIs. The prevalence of primary HIV-1 drug resistance, particularly to NNRTIs, in this group of recently infected youth was high."

A retrospective study of participants consecutively recruited at the UCSD HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program examined effects of combined ART and SGAs on body mass index (BMI), nonfasting serum lipids, diabetes mellitus (DM) incidence, and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Metabolic outcome variables and covariates were compared using t-tests, Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests. Linear and logistic multivariable models explored metabolic outcomes for participants taking (SGA+) or not taking (SGA-) concomitant SGAs, after controlling for demographic and HIV disease- and ART-related covariates. Of 2229 HIV-infected participants, 12% (N=258) were treated with SGAs. In multivariable models adjusted for relevant covariates, the SGA+ group had significantly higher mean triglycerides, significantly higher odds of DM, significantly higher MAPs and marginally higher BMI. The use of SGAs in HIV-infected adults taking ART was independently associated with worse indicators of MetS and cardiovascular risk. Aggressive monitoring for the metabolic complications from concurrent SGA and ART is indicated in all patients receiving these medication combinations. "

Therefore, HIV/AIDS still remains a public health emergency and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. It is believed that reverse transcriptase (RT) is a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of HIV-1, and thereby RT has been the important drug target for antiretroviral (ARV) chemotherapy against AIDS. To our knowledge, dipyridodiazepinone analogs have been considered as one class of potential non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), especially the structurally and chemically related nevirapine (Viramune(R)), which was the first NNRTI approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection for adults in 1996 and for children in 1998. This review mainly highlights the progress of synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of dipyridodiazepinone analogs; in the meantime, the mechanism of action is also presented. It will pave the way for the design and development of novel dipyridodiazepinone analogs as NNRTIs in AIDS chemotherapy in the future."

Apoptosis and cellular immune responses are crucial to the clearance or persistence of viral infections. This case-control study was carried out to detect whether apoptosis genes single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) confer risk to HCV in a cohort of Egyptian patients and to explore their association with viral load. One hundred and ninety six blood samples were withdrawn from 96 HCV patients and 100 controls. The Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) -1525G>A and FasL-844T>C SNPs were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Hepatitis C viral load was measured using Real time PCR. Results Genotypes distributions of TRAIL -1525G>A and FasL-844 T>C polymorphisms in controls were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). The study showed a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the TRAIL -1525G>A polymorphism genotypes and the FasL-844 T>C polymorphism genotypes between the HCV patients and the controls (p=0.001 and 0.02 respectively), with association of the -1525GA genotype and -844 TT genotype with increased risk of HCV infection (OR=2.68, 1.942 respectively, 95% CI=1.482-4.846, 1.1-3.43, respectively). No significant association was detected between TRAIL, FasL and the viral load. Our results suggest that the FasL -844T>C SNP is implicated in the susceptibility to HCV in Egyptian patients and firstly report the involvement of TRAIL gene polymorphism in the risk of the disease. Therefore we recommend national programs to delineate genetic factors that may put individuals at risk for contracting HCV."

Comparing immunodiscordant and immunoconcordant subjects matched by pretreatment CD4 counts, we observed a lower pretreatment CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio in immunodiscordant subjects. Furthermore, pretreatment CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio, but not CD4 counts, correlated with the main immunological alterations observed in immunodiscordants, including increased regulatory T-cell (Treg) frequency and T-cell turnover-related markers. Then, in a larger cohort, only baseline CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio was independently associated with immunodiscordance, after adjusting by the viral CXCR4-tropic HIV variants. Our results suggest that the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio could be an accurate biomarker of the subjacent immunological damage triggering immunodiscordance."

The detailed kinetic of HLA-B51-restricted CTL responses was described through blood sampling time points including seroconversion, 3 and 6 months after HIV-1 infection in the 7 HLA-B51+ individuals, by using 16 known HLA-B51 restricted epitopes. Pol743-751 (LPPVVAKEI, LI9), Pol283-289 (TAFTIPSI, TI8), and Gag327-3459 (NANPDCKTI, NI9) were identified as 3 dominant epitopes, and ranked as starting with LI9, followed by TI8 and NI9 in the ability to induce T-cell responses. The dynamics of escape mutations in the 3 epitopes were also found with the same order as T-cell response, by using sequencing for viral clones on blood sampling at seroconversion, 3 and 6 months after HIV-1 infection.We use solid evidence to demonstrate the correlation between T-cell response and HIV-1 mutation, and postulate that multiple T-cell responses might benefit the control of HIV-1 infection, especially in acute infection phase.

Doc No.463,8462,negative/unlabeled,9.544469,[The function and application of the IL28B gene in HCV infection and treatment].,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the etiological factor for Hepatitis C, which is one of the most important pathogenic factors of chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV infection brings great threat to human health. Host genetic background could impact HCV infection, viral clearance, and treatment. Recently, some genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of HCV patients were performed. The results showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IL28B gene, which encodes protein IFN-lambda3, are associated with viral clearance and treatment effectiveness of HCV patients who were cured by PEG-IFNalpha combined with ribavirin (RBV). IFN-lambda3 interacts with its acceptor, a heterodimer (IFN-lambdaR1 x IL-10R2), and upregulates the IFN-stimulated gene factors (ISGF). IFN-lambda3 plays roles in antiviral, antitumor, and immunoloregulation, and thus it might become a potential drug for Hepatitis C treatment. However, the mechanism of the IL28B gene in HCV infection and treatment is unclear, and further studies are needed to reveal the veils and provide theoretical basis for developing a new antiviral drug in clinic."
Doc No.464,376,positive/labeled,9.542709,Inverse relationship between viral load and genotypic resistance mutations in Korean patients with primary HIV type 1 infections.,"The transmission of antiretroviral-resistant HIV-1 strains is associated with suboptimal virological responses to initial antiretroviral therapy. However, certain types of resistance mutations are known to be associated with decreased viral fitness, which confers a lower replication capacity than that of the wild-type virus in the absence of antiretroviral drugs. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between antiretroviral resistance mutations and viral replication in the primary HIV-1 infection (PHI) period. From January 2002 to March 2005, 52 PHI patients were identified in the Republic of Korea. HIV-1 RNA genotyping was performed, and the resistance mutation score was obtained from the HIV Drug Resistance Database of Stanford University. We defined the sum of the average resistance mutation scores (SARMS) for each antiretroviral drug class as a measure of the degree of resistance of any specific strain. The overall mean SARMS was 2.00 +/- 2.74, and the annual mean did not change significantly during the study period. No critical resistance mutation gene was identified in the study group. The SARMS showed a weak negative correlation with the viral load log10 during PHI, but without statistical significance (r = -0.274, p = 0.051). But the mean SARMS of patients with a viral load exceeding 100,000 copies/ml was significantly lower than that of patients with a viral load of less than 100,000 copies/ml (p = 0.03). Evaluation of the potency of antiretroviral resistance revealed a weak negative correlation with viral replication in the PHI period. This could be one reason why the transmission of resistant strains in PHI patients is not increasing significantly despite the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)."

The aim of the present study was to identify genes associated with spontaneous HCV clearance in a population of Iranian patients. We genotyped 110 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 59 selected--candidate--genes in a cohort of 107 HCV-infected participants who spontaneously cleared the infection and 176 participants whose infection persisted. Three out of the 110 SNPs were found to be associated with HCV outcome (P-values<0.03). rs11506105 in EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor gene), and rs11881222 and rs12979860 in IL28B (interferon-λ3 gene). Multivariate logistic regression of the three markers showed that the A/A genotypes in both rs11506105 (EFGR) and rs11881222 (IL28B), and the C/C genotype in rs12979860 (IL28B) are associated with HCV clearance (recessive model: odds ratio (OR)=2.06, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.09-3.88, P=0.025; OR=2.09, 95% CI=1.23-3.60, P=0.007; and OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.15-3.35, P=0.014 for rs11506105, rs12979860 and rs11881222, respectively). In conclusion, EGFR and IL28B SNPs are strong independent predictive markers of spontaneous viral clearance."

In the three HIV-seropositive hemophiliacs it was demonstrated that there was a decrease in peripheral helper T cells, a fact significantly different from normal controls (P less than 0.05); there was an increase in peripheral suppressor T cells and a decrease in helper to suppressor T cell ratio, another fact significantly different from normal controls (P less than 0.005, P less than 0.002 respectively) as well as HIV-seronegative hemophiliacs (P less than 0.02). In addition, all three HIV-seropositive hemophiliacs had anergy for 1:2000 OT test. It appeared that these immunological abnormalities are the results of HIV infection. The number of peripheral helper T cell and suppressor T cells and the ratio of helper to suppressor cells in the HIV-seronegative hemophiliacs did not differ from those in normal controls. Among 15 HIV-seronegative hemophiliacs tested with 1:2000 OT, only two showed anergy. The findings in our study differed somewhat from those reported abroad. This difference may be due to the fact that our hemophilic patients had been treated with much smaller doses of blood products for alleviating coagulation defects."
Doc No.467,2854,negative/unlabeled,9.51402,Short communication: enhanced CD8+ T cell apoptosis in HIV-infected adolescents with virologic failure on protease inhibitor-based therapy.,"In this study, we investigated the possibility of differential effects of protease inhibitor (PI)-containing (PI(+)) and PI-sparing (PI(-)) antiretroviral therapies (ART) on CD8(+) T cell apoptosis. We retrospectively analyzed both PD-1 expression and CD8(+) T cell apoptosis in a cross-sectional study of HIV-positive adolescents and young adults (mean age = 17.4 years), with perinatally or behaviorally acquired HIV infection. Fifty-one specimens of cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analyzed using 7-color flow cytometry: 20 from patients receiving PI(+) ART, 14 from PI(-) ART, and 17 from the untreated. The results showed that percentages of PD-1(+) CD8(+) T cells were strongly correlated with plasma viral loads regardless of treatment (p = 0.0001). The percentage of PD-1(+) CD8(+) T cells was also positively associated with percentages of Annexin V(+) CD8(+) T cells (p = 0.04) in the PI(+)-treated group. The fraction of apoptotic (Annexin V(+)) CD8(+) T cells was associated with viral load in the patients receiving ART that contained one or more protease inhibitors (p = 0.029), but not in the PI(-) or untreated groups. In summary, we found a direct correlation between PD-1 expression on CD8(+) T cells and HIV levels that was not affected by types of medications used in the ART of those adolescents, suggesting that virological success is necessary for PD-1 downregulation. CD8(+) T cell apoptosis was linked to high levels of PD-1 expression and HIV viremia. However, there was a higher degree of apoptosis among viremic patients receiving PI therapy, suggesting an immunologically adverse effect of continuing PI(+) therapy after virological failure."
Doc No.468,117,negative/unlabeled,9.494832,Validation of the INNO-LiPA HBV DR assay (version 2) in monitoring hepatitis B virus-infected patients receiving nucleoside analog treatment.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral drug resistance mutations prevent successful outcome of treatment and lead to worsening of liver disease. Detection of its emergence permits opportune treatment with alternative drugs. Unfortunately, the use of newly approved antivirals, including adefovir dipivoxil, emtricitabine, and telbivudine, is also associated with the development of drug resistance, albeit to a lesser extent than the use of lamivudine. The objectives of this work were to assess the performance characteristics (sensitivity and accuracy) of an updated drug resistance test, the INNO-LiPA HBV DR v2, which includes detection of mutations associated with lamivudine, adefovir, emtricitabine, and telbivudine resistance, and to compare the results with consensus sequencing of serum samples from patients treated with HBV antivirals. Diagnostic sensitivity, defined as detection of a positive amplification line on the line probe assay (LiPA) strip, was 94.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.7 to 97.9) after initial testing, increasing to 96.3% (95% CI, 91.6 to 98.8) after repeat test 1 and to 100% (95% CI, 97.3 to 100.0) after repeat test 2. In diagnostic accuracy determinations, full concordance was observed between sequencing and LiPA for 77.0% of the codons tested (620/805 codons [95% CI, 74.0 to 79.9]), whereas LiPA and sequencing were partially concordant 22% of the time (177/805 codons). In 167 out of 177 cases, LiPA detected a wild-type/mutant mixture whereas sequencing detected only one of the two results. Performance testing of the new LiPA test, the INNO-LiPA HBV DR v2, showed convincing diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy. The ability of the test to detect mixed infections and minority viral populations associated with resistance to the current generation of antivirals, including adefovir, emtricitabine, and telbivudine, makes it a useful tool for HBV therapy monitoring."

Interestingly, CD57-expressing CD8(+) T cells exhibit a dual profile, being simultaneously highly cytotoxic (terminally differentiated effectors) and poorly proliferative (replicative senescent). Recent publications point toward a positive role of CD57-expressing CD8(+) T cell subsets, presumably due to their high cytolytic activity. We further investigated the phenotype of CD57-expressing CD8(+) T cells in healthy donors and during HIV infection combining CD57 expression to Eomesodermin (EOMES), a T box transcription factor which determines, coordinately with T-bet, effector and memory CD8(+) T cell differentiation. We defined in healthy donors two functionally distinct CD57-expressing CD8(+) T cell subsets exhibiting different levels of EOMES expression: EOMES(hi) CD57(+) and EOMES(int) CD57(+) CD8(+) T cells. EOMES(hi) CD57(+) cells exhibited low cytotoxic activity but preserved proliferative capacity and interleukin 7 (IL-7) receptor expression, whereas EOMES(int) CD57(+) cells exhibited obvious cytotoxic functions and a more terminally differentiated phenotype. We next performed a similar analysis in different contexts of HIV infection: primary infected patients, long-term viremic patients, aviremic patients treated with antiretroviral therapy, and HIV controllers; we demonstrated a higher percentage of CD57-expressing cells in all HIV-infected patients regardless of virological status. When heterogeneity in EOMES expression among CD57 cells was taken into account, we detected significantly higher proportions of EOMES(hi) CD57(+) cells among HIV-specific and nonspecific CD8(+) T cells from HIV controllers than in aviremic antiretroviral-treated patients and viremic patients. Importantly, such a peculiar non-terminally differentiated EOMES(hi) CD57(+) phenotypic profile was associated with viral control. Importance: This study demonstrates that functional heterogeneity exists among CD57-expressing CD8 T cells, which include both terminally differentiated, highly cytotoxic EOMES(int) CD57(+) CD8(+) T cells and less differentiated EOMES(hi) CD57(+) CD8 T cells, which do not exhibit immediate cytotoxic functions but present high proliferative capacity. Interestingly, HIV controllers present a high proportion of EOMES(hi) CD57 cells among CD57-expressing HIV-specific CD8 T cells compared to both long-term viremic and aviremic antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated patients, suggesting a beneficial role for this cell subset in viral control."

Decreased CD4 lymphocytes, high human immunodeficiency viral load (HIVL) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are risk factors for CIN. We characterized the prevalence, risk factors and prognosis of histologically-verified CIN among systematically followed HIV-infected women enrolled from a low HIV-prevalence population. The study population comprised 153 HIV-infected women followed between 1989 and 2006. The mean +/- SD duration of follow-up was 5.6 +/- 3.8 years. Demographic as well as treatment-related data were derived from medical reports. During the follow-up, 51 subjects (33%) displayed CIN (16% CIN 1 and 18% CIN 2 +), whereas 102 subjects had Pap smear results of normal cells, atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance, or signs of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) but no CIN in histological specimens from the cervix. Only one case of cancer of the uterine cervix was detected. Pap smears were reliable in screening for CIN; 75% of patients with CIN had high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or LSIL in Pap smears taken at the time of dysplasia. The incidence of CIN decreased from 12.7 to 3.5 (per 100 subjects) between 2000 and 2005 (P = 0.07). The risk of CIN was not associated with decreased levels of CD4 lymphocytes, duration of HIV infection, use of antiretroviral medication or plasma HIVL. In univariate analysis, bacterial vaginosis (BV) was associated with a significantly increased risk of CIN, whereas parity was associated with lower risk of CIN. Each delivery lowered the risk of CIN by 30% (P = 0.02). The significantly lower risk of CIN among parous women (P = 0.04) persisted in multivariate analysis. CIN was treated by means of loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), (n = 34). The recurrence rate was low; seven subjects (14%) had a recurrence of CIN during follow-up. The nadir of CD4 lymphocytes was lower (P = 0.04) and the HIVL higher (P = 0.03) among subjects with recurrence of CIN. Duration of HIV infection, use of antiretroviral medication and positive margins in LEEP specimens were indistinguishable among subjects with vs. without recurrence of CIN. The prevalence of CIN is high among systematically managed HIV-infected women. However, the incidence of CIN decreased during the 21st century. BV was associated with an increased risk of CIN whereas parous women had lower risk of CIN. However, the patients with and without CIN could not be distinguished on the basis of previously described risk factors. Regular follow-up by means of Pap smears is warranted in all HIV-infected women."

However, a SIV-HIV-1 chimera (RT-SHIV), in which the RT from SIVmac239 was replaced with the RT-encoding region from HIV-1, is susceptible to NNRTIs and is infectious to rhesus macaques. We have evaluated the antiviral activity of efavirenz against RT-SHIV and the emergence of efavirenz-resistant mutants in vitro and in vivo. RT-SHIV was susceptible to efavirenz with a mean effective concentration of 5.9 +/- 4.5 nM, and RT-SHIV variants selected with efavirenz in cell culture displayed 600-fold-reduced susceptibility. The efavirenz-resistant mutants of RT-SHIV had mutations in RT similar to those of HIV-1 variants that were selected under similar conditions. Efavirenz monotherapy of RT-SHIV-infected macaques produced a 1.82-log-unit decrease in plasma viral-RNA levels after 1 week. The virus load rebounded within 3 weeks in one treated animal and more slowly in a second animal. Virus isolated from these two animals contained the K103N and Y188C or Y188L mutations. The RT-SHIV-rhesus macaque model may prove useful for studies of antiretroviral drug combinations that include efavirenz."

Cell lines coexpressing CD4 and these chemokine receptors were infected with a panel of seven primary HIV-2 isolates passaged in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and three laboratory HIV-2 strains passaged in T-cell lines. The CCR-5, CCR-3, and CXCR-4 coreceptors could all be used by HIV-2. The ability to use CXCR-4 represents a major difference between HIV-2 and the closely related simian immunodeficiency viruses. Most HIV-2 strains using CCR-5 could also use CCR-3, sometimes with similar efficiencies. As observed for HIV-1, the usage of CCR-5 or CCR-3 was observed principally for HIV-2 strains derived from asymptomatic individuals, while HIV-2 strains derived from AIDS patients used CXCR-4. However, there were several exceptions, and the patterns of coreceptor usage seemed more complex for HIV-2 than for HIV-1. The two T-tropic HIV-2 strains tested used CXCR-4 and not CCR-5, while T-tropic HIV-1 can generally use both. Moreover, among five primary HIV-2 strains all unable to use CXCR-4, three could replicate in CCR-5-negative PBMC, which has not been reported for HIV-1. These observations suggest that the CCR-5 coreceptor is less important for HIV-2 than for HIV-1 and indicate that HIV-2 can use other cell entry pathways and probably other coreceptors. One HIV-2 isolate replicating in normal or CCR-5-negative PBMC failed to infect CXCR-4+ cells or the U87MG-CD4 and sMAGI cell lines, which are permissive to infection by HIV-2 but not by HIV-1. This suggests the existence of several HIV-2-specific coreceptors, which are differentially expressed in cell lines and PBMC."

We set out to gain patient perceptions on factors that facilitate and challenge access and adherence to such therapy. We carried out two semi-structured interviews 12 months apart with 40 HIV-positive people drawn from three economically deprived townships in the Copperbelt, Zambia. We also conducted a focus group of 12 of these interviewees. Availability of medication in health facilities did not automatically ensure access to those in need. A prerequisite for commencing on treatment was a positive documented HIV test result, but too few HIV testing centres, fear of family and community rejection and male domination in sexual and social decision-making prevented a number from coming forward to be tested. Once within the system of care, further barriers, such as rumours of bad side-effects, inconsistent information, high costs of drugs (at the time of the first interviews), ongoing costs of additional medical tests, overcrowded systems and overworked staff, all hindered access to receiving treatment. When taken, therapy brought side-effects, the most common being increased appetite and hunger. Yet, despite these barriers and challenges many of those on treatment reported good adherence. Immediate factors, such as seeing ill people becoming well; being supported by a friend or family member; and having a watch or clock to keep to a regular regime, were important. The increase in the number of people who were expected to die but were now looking well also shifted community attitudes. HIV/AIDS is beginning to move from a hidden terminal disease to a chronic condition that is treatable."

Compared to chronically infected, antiretroviral-untreated patients, most chronically infected, treated patients with detectable viremia lack a cellular immune response against the Gag 77-85(SL9) epitope but show a new immunodominant response against an epitope in protease PR 76-84. Hence, mutations induced by antiretroviral therapy likely alter the profile of epitopes presented to T cells and thus the direction of the response. The consequences of dual pressures from treatment and CTL need to be considered in monitoring of drug therapy."

One of the most common opportunistic infections in these patients is Pneumocystis pneumonia. CD8+ T cells are recruited to the lung after P. carinii infection and have been associated with both lung injury and host defense. This variability may be due to subpopulations of CD8+ T cells recruited to the lung. We have previously shown using adoptive transfer studies that in vivo-generated T-cytotoxic-1 (Tc1) CD8+ T cells, defined by the secretion of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), have effector activity against Pneumocystis spp. in vitro as well as in vivo. To better understand the mechanisms of these effects, we generated, expanded, and tested Tc1 and Tc2 CD8+ T cells specific for P. murina ex vivo. Tc1-polarized CD8+ T cells secreted higher levels of IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and lower levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 than Tc2 CD8+ T cells when stimulated with P. murina antigen. Moreover, Tc1 CD8+ T cells demonstrated enhanced effector activity in a macrophage-mediated killing assay which was independent of cell contact. The augmentation in macrophage-mediated P. murina killing was significantly abrogated when GM-CSF was neutralized in the Tc1 CD8+ T cells. These data support the possibility that antigen-specific GM-CSF secretion is critical for effector activity of P. murina-specific Tc1 CD8+ T cells in vitro."
Doc No.476,9353,negative/unlabeled,9.444435,Activation of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat by herpes simplex virus type 1 is associated with induction of a nuclear factor that binds to the NF-kappa B/core enhancer sequence.,"It has been previously shown that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection of HeLa cells results in augmentation of gene expression directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat (LTR). This effect is presumably mediated by protein interactions with the LTR. We have used two different assays of DNA-protein interactions to study the HSV-induced activation of the HIV LTR. Activation of the HIV LTR is associated with increased protein binding to LTR sequences in a region including the NF-kappa B/core enhancer and the Sp1 binding sequences as monitored by an exonuclease protection assay. Gel retardation assays demonstrated that HSV-1 infection resulted in the induction of a nuclear factor(s) that binds to the NF-kappa B/core enhancer sequence. In addition to the activation of the HIV LTR, HSV induction of NF-kappa B activity may be important for the regulation of HSV gene expression during a herpesvirus infection."

To circumvent this obstacle, an in vitro culture system for post-activation long-term survival of normal CD4+ T-cells in a quiescent (non-cycling) state was developed and used to generate latently infected, long-lived quiescent CD4+ T-cells from HIV-infected, activated normal CD4+ T-lymphocytes. This yielded a frequency of approximately 5x10(4) latently infected cells per 10(6) cells in culture, which is approximately 10(3)- to 10(4)-fold higher than that available from patients. Moreover, 5-10% of long-term surviving non-cycling T-cells were found to make infectious HIV continuously at low levels, showing that HIV production from infected T-cells does not require full cellular activation. This model system should facilitate studies of long-lived, latently infected and persistently HIV-producing quiescent normal CD4+ T-lymphocytes."
Doc No.478,1762,negative/unlabeled,9.429929,Camptothecin inhibits Tat-mediated transactivation of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus.,"Transcription of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is governed by the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). By using HIV-1 LTR-directed reporter gene systems, we found that the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin inhibits Tat-mediated transactivation of HIV-1 LTR. The 293.27.2 cells that carry a stably transfected HIV-1 LTR-directed lacZ gene expression vector (pNAZ) were used. Inhibitions of LTR were observed at camptothecin concentrations (IC50 about 0.03 microM, which was an order of magnitude lower than for Ro 24-7429), which had minor effects on cell survival, expression of the cellular gene gro, or Rous sarcoma virus-directed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression. Inhibition was also seen with RPMI 8402, which is a human CD4-positive lymphocyte line transiently transfected with a HIV-1 LTR-directed (CAT) gene. Experiments with HIV-1 LTR mutants suggest that transactivation response sequence but not NF-kappa B is responsible for the inhibition by camptothecin. The target for camptothecin may be a cellular factor that is important for the activation of HIV-1 LTR by Tat and thus may offer a potential target for therapy of HIV-1 infection."
Doc No.479,8503,negative/unlabeled,9.426714,Dynamic analysis of CD127 expression on memory CD8 T cells from patients with chronic hepatitis B during telbivudine treatment.,Accumulating evidence supports the theory that expression of CD127 on CD8 T cells during the process of antiviral immune response indicates a subset of effect CD8 T cells that successfully develop into fully protective memory. CD8 T cells expression of CD127 may be used as a predictor to evaluate disease status in chronic viral infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the CD127 expression level on different subsets of CD8 T cell and explore the relationship between CD127 expression on CD8 memory T cells and serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) levels in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). We also aimed to investigate the CD127 expression pattern on CD8 memory T cells of CHB patients who were treated with Telbivudine.

HLA-B57 and the closely related allele B*5801 are particularly associated with enhanced control and recognize the same Gag(240-249) TW10 epitope. The typical escape mutation (T242N) within this epitope diminishes viral replication capacity in chronically infected persons; however, little is known about TW10 epitope sequences in residual replicating viruses in B57/B*5801 EC and the extent to which mutations within this epitope may influence steady-state viremia. Here we analyzed TW10 in a total of 50 B57/B*5801-positive subjects (23 EC and 27 viremic subjects). Autologous plasma viral sequences from both EC and viremic subjects frequently harbored the typical cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-selected mutation T242N (15/23 sequences [65.2%] versus 23/27 sequences [85.1%], respectively; P = 0.18). However, other unique mutants were identified in HIV controllers, both within and flanking TW10, that were associated with an even greater reduction in viral replication capacity in vitro. In addition, strong CTL responses to many of these unique TW10 variants were detected by gamma interferon-specific enzyme-linked immunospot assay. These data suggest a dual mechanism for durable control of HIV replication, consisting of viral fitness loss resulting from CTL escape mutations together with strong CD8 T-cell immune responses to the arising variant epitopes."
Doc No.481,2122,negative/unlabeled,9.423097,Role of glucocorticoid receptor binding sites in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat in steroid-mediated suppression of HIV gene expression.,"Dexamethasone inhibited human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR)-directed gene expression in cells of T and B lymphoblastoid lineages, but not in monocytic cells. Suppression required an intact glucocorticoid receptor (GR), as it was amplified by transfection of lymphocytes with a plasmid encoding the human GR and blocked by the receptor antagonist RU486. These results were in direct contrast to the effects of dexamethasone on a murine leukemia retrovirus promoter where, consistent with the findings of others, activation of gene expression was obtained. Potential regions of the HIV-1 LTR mediating these effects were sought, with sequence homologies predicting two new glucocorticoid response element half-sites, GRE-II (nucleotides -6 to -1) and GRE-III (+ 15 to + 20), downstream from a previously identified GR DNA binding domain, GRE-I (-264 to -259). Mutational analyses documented the loss of inhibitory activity attendant on changes in GRE-III and the independence of steroid-mediated effects from GRE-I and GRE-II. Consistent with these findings, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a difference in binding of cellular factors to GRE-III in cells of T and B lymphocyte vs. monocytic lineages. Binding sites for the cellular transcription factor leader binding protein (LBP-1) were found to overlap with GRE-III, and LBP-1 interacted with this element in the HIV LTR only in T and B lymphocytic extracts. We hypothesize that GRE-III sequence-specific effects, including modulation of LBP-GR interactions, underlie the negative regulatory effect of glucocorticoids on HIV-1 gene expression, with some specificity for cell type."
Doc No.482,6933,negative/unlabeled,9.421299,Engagement of CD43 enhances human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcriptional activity and virus production that is induced upon TCR/CD3 stimulation.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcriptional activity is regulated by several cytokines and T cell activators. CD43 (sialophorin) is a sialoglycoprotein expressed on the surface of a wide variety of blood cells including T lymphocytes. Several studies have shown that CD43 ligation induces proliferation and activation of human T lymphocytes. We were thus interested in defining whether CD43-mediated signaling events can modulate the life cycle of HIV-1. We demonstrate here that CD43 cross-linking potentiates HIV-1 promoter-driven activity and virus production that is seen following the engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR).CD3 complex. This effect is independent of the CD28 co-stimulatory molecule and is mediated by both NF-kappaB and NFAT transcription factors. A number of signal transducers known to be involved in the TCR/CD3-dependent signal transduction pathway, including p56(lck), p36(lat), and SLP-76, as well as capacitative entry of calcium, are crucial for the noticed CD43 co-stimulatory effect. Calcium mobilization studies indicate that a synergy is occurring between CD43- and TCR/CD3-mediated signaling events leading to an augmented calcium release. These data suggest that CD43 can be seen as a co-stimulatory cell surface constituent that can modulate HIV-1 expression in T lymphocytes."
Doc No.483,4831,positive/labeled,9.40984,Effect of antiretroviral therapy on cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"To better understand whether potent antiretroviral therapies can modify the natural history of HIV-1-associated microsporidiosis and cryptosporidiosis, the response to antimicrobial treatment of these opportunistic infections was evaluated in patients with or without antiretroviral treatment. Fifty patients with diarrhoea, all positive for Cryptosporidium parvum or Enterocytozoon bieneusi, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected concerning demographics, clinical and microbiological characteristics of the parasitic infection, antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Faecal samples were prepared using the Richie formalin-ethyl acetate method and stained using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for detection of Cryptosporidium parvum and Isospora belli, the modified trichrome and calcofluor white technique for detection of Enterocytozoon spp., and iodine for detection of ova, cysts or vegetative forms. Diarrhoea was defined as an abnormal increase in stool liquidity, an abnormal increase in stool frequency and a daily stool weight of more than 250 g for a period of at least 4 days. Patients treated with double antiretroviral therapy or protease inhibitors demonstrated an excellent response and a sustained therapeutic effect after follow-up (range, 5-36 months). The relapse of cryptosporidiosis in two patients who discontinued antiretroviral therapy suggests that the infection might remain in a latent stage. The resolution of the diarrhoea seems to be related to an increased CD4+ cell count rather than to the viral load. In conclusion, these data strongly support the hypothesis that combination antiretroviral therapy is able to greatly modify the course of cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis in patients infected with HIV-1."

We examined the prospective relationship between depressive symptoms and adherence, virologic failure, and suppressed immune function in people living with HIV/AIDS in Tanzania. Data from 403 study participants who were on stable ART and engaged in HIV clinical care were analyzed. We assessed crude and adjusted associations of depressive symptoms and ART adherence, both at baseline and at 12 months, using logistic regression. We used logistic generalized estimating equations to assess the association and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between depressive symptoms and both virologic failure and suppressed immune function. Ten percent of participants reported moderate or severe depressive symptoms at baseline and 31% of participants experienced virologic failure (>150 copies/ml) over two years. Depressive symptoms were associated with greater odds of reported medication nonadherence at both baseline (Odds Ratio [OR] per 1-unit increase = 1.18, 95% CI [1.12, 1.24]) and 12 months (OR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.03, 1.14]). By contrast, increases in depressive symptom score were inversely related to both virologic failure (OR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.87, 1.00]) and immune system suppression (OR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.79, 0.99]), though the association between depressive symptoms and clinical outcomes was less precise than for the association with nonadherence. Findings indicate a positive association between depressive symptoms and nonadherence, and also an inverse relationship between depressive symptoms and clinical outcomes, possibly due to informative loss to follow-up."
Doc No.485,2685,negative/unlabeled,9.375887,Drug-drug interaction in a kidney transplant recipient receiving HIV salvage therapy and tacrolimus.,"Concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents and antiretroviral drugs may lead to complex drug-drug interactions. The calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A4 (encoded by the CYP3A4 gene) and is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (encoded by the ABCB1 gene). Both pathways can be inhibited by protease inhibitors (PIs). The reduction in first-pass and postabsorptive metabolism of tacrolimus by PIs can lead to extreme prolongation of the elimination half-life and significantly increase tacrolimus trough levels. In a patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis leading to kidney cadaveric transplantation, HIV salvage therapy was started with the new PI darunavir and boosted with ritonavir, another PI. The reduction in first-pass and postabsorptive metabolism of tacrolimus by PIs led to a dramatic increase in tacrolimus trough levels and extreme prolongation of the elimination half-life. Trough levels of tacrolimus levels were as high as 106.7 ng/mL. A decrease in tacrolimus dosage to a single dose of 0.5 mg/wk, corresponding to 3.5% of the usual dose, enabled maintenance of stable tacrolimus trough levels. Our case highlights that coadministration of a PI and tacrolimus is feasible through intense reduction in dose and prolongation of the dosing interval of the calcineurin inhibitor. Complex drug interactions may become more frequent because more HIV-infected patients are undergoing transplantation and newer HIV drugs are being used. Close monitoring and excellent adherence are mandatory to avoid the risk of harm for the graft and patient."
Doc No.486,3074,negative/unlabeled,9.372588,Monocyte activation by circulating fibronectin fragments in HIV-1-infected patients.,"To identify signals that can alter leukocyte function in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we analyzed single blood samples from 74 HIV-1-infected patients and additional blood was collected at 90-day intervals from 51 HIV-1-infected patients over a 516 +/- 172 (mean +/- SD) day interval. Despite the absence of circulating immune complexes and normalization of phagocytic function, compared with controls, the fraction of patients' monocytes expressing CD49e and CD62L was decreased and expression of CD11b and CD86 increased. Plasma from 63% of patients but none from normal controls contained 110-120 kDa fibronectin fragments (FNf). Presence of FNf did not reflect poor adherence to therapy. Addition of FNf to normal donor blood in vitro replicated changes in monocyte CD49e, CD62L, CD11b, and CD86 seen in vivo. FNf also induced monocytes to release a serine proteinase, nominally identified as proteinase-3, that hydrolyzed cell surface CD49e. alpha(1)-Antitrypsin blocked FNf-induced shedding of CD49e in a dose-dependent manner. Plasma with a normal frequency of CD49e(+) monocytes contained antiproteases that partially blocked FNf-induced monocyte CD49e shedding, whereas plasma from patients with a low frequency of CD49e(+) monocytes did not block this effect of FNf. Electrophoretic analyses of plasma from the latter group of patients suggested that a significant fraction of their alpha(1)-antitrypsin was tied up in high molecular mass complexes. These results suggest that monocyte behavior in HIV-1-infected patients may be influenced by FNf and the ratio of protease and antiproteases in the cells' microenvironment."
Doc No.487,4359,negative/unlabeled,9.370965,Selective pressures of HLA genotypes and antiviral therapy on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 sequence mutation at a population level.,"The objective of this study was a comprehensive analysis of the immune-driven evolution of viruses of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) clade B in a large patient cohort treated at a single hospital in Germany and its implications for antiretroviral therapy. We examined the association of the HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 alleles with the emergence of mutations in the complete protease gene and the first 330 codons of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene of HIV-1, studying their distribution and persistence and their impact on antiviral drug therapy. The clinical data for 179 HIV-infected patients, the results of HLA genotyping, and virus sequences were analyzed using a variety of statistical approaches. We describe new HLA-associated mutations in both viral protease and RT, several of which are associated with HLA-DRB1. The mutations reported are remarkably persistent within our cohort, developing more slowly in a minority of patients. Interestingly, several HLA-associated mutations occur at the same positions as drug resistance mutations in patient viruses, where the viral sequence was acquired before exposure to these drugs. The influence of HLA on thymidine analogue mutation pathways was not observed. We were able to confirm immune-driven selection pressure by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II alleles through the identification of HLA-associated mutations. HLA-B alleles were involved in more associations (68%) than either HLA-A (23%) or HLA-DRB1 (9%). As several of the HLA-associated mutations lie at positions associated with drug resistance, our results indicate possible negative effects of HLA genotypes on the development of HIV-1 drug resistance."

The present study investigated the occurrence of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs4986790 (A>G) and rs4986791 (C>T) in the TLR4 gene in chronic carriers of the hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses. A total of 420 blood samples were collected (HBV, 49; HCV, 72; and controls, 299) at the liver disease outpatient clinic of Hospital da Fundação Santa Casa de Misericórdia do Pará (FSCMPA). Genomic DNA extracted from leukocytes was subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis to identify the genetic profile of the participants. No significant differences were found in the allele and genotype frequencies between the infected participants and controls. No significant associations were found between the investigated polymorphisms and inflammatory activity, fibrosis, and the presence of cirrhosis; the same results were obtained in the haplotype analysis. The results showed a lack of association between the rs4986790 and rs4986791 SNPs and susceptibility to infection with HBV and HCV, as well as clinical and laboratory information of the patients. "
Doc No.489,5368,negative/unlabeled,9.367102,Antiretroviral therapy restores diversity in the T-cell receptor Vbeta repertoire of CD4 T-cell subpopulations among human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children and adolescents.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection perturbs the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta repertoire. The TCR CDR3 length diversity of individual Vbeta families was examined within CD45RA and CD45RO CD4 T cells to assess the impact of the virus on clonality throughout CD4 T-cell activation and differentiation. A cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort study of 13 HIV-infected and 8 age-matched healthy children and adolescents examined the Vbeta CDR3 length profiles within CD4 T-cell subsets by the use of spectratyping. HIV-infected subjects demonstrated higher numbers of perturbations in CD4 CD45RA T cells (5.8 +/- 4.9 Vbeta families) than healthy individuals (1.6 +/- 1.8 Vbeta families) (P = 0.04). Surprisingly, CD4 CD45RO central memory T cells from infected subjects showed no increased perturbations compared to the perturbations for the same cells from healthy subjects (2.9 +/- 3.1 and 1.1 +/- 1.8 Vbeta families, respectively; P = 0.11). CD4 CD45RA TCR perturbations were higher among infected subjects with >25% CD4 cells than healthy subjects (mean number of perturbed Vbeta families, 6.6 +/- 5.4; P = 0.04). No correlations between perturbations in CD4 subsets and pretherapy age or viral load were evident. In contrast to CD8 T cells, HIV induces TCR disruptions within CD45RA but not CD45RO CD4 T cells. Therapy-induced viral suppression resulted in increases in thymic output and the normalization of the diversity of TCR within CD45RA CD4 T cells after 2 months of treatment. Perturbations occur prior to CD4 T-cell attrition and normalize with effective antiretroviral therapy. The impact of HIV on the diversity of TCR within naïve, central memory, and effector memory CD4 T cells is distinctly different from that in CD8 T cells."
Doc No.490,5514,positive/labeled,9.359229,"The decrease of regulatory T cells correlates with excessive activation and apoptosis of CD8+ T cells in HIV-1-infected typical progressors, but not in long-term non-progressors.","Persistent HIV infection results in a decrease in absolute counts of CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg). To investigate the role of decreased Treg counts in the regulation of excessive activation and apoptosis of CD8(+) T cells in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, we characterized Treg in 83 HIV-1-infected individuals, including 19 long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) and 51 typical progressors (TPs) who were treatment-naïve, and 13 AIDS patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), of whom nine were complete responders (CRs) and the remaining four were non-responders (NRs) to the treatment. TPs but not LTNPs had a significant decrease in absolute counts of circulating Treg, which was inversely correlated with the activation and apoptosis of CD8(+) T cells. Efficient HAART was found to increase Treg counts in CR patients and temper the excessive activation and apoptosis of CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, isolated Treg significantly inhibited the spontaneous and anti-CD3-induced apoptosis of CD8(+) T cells in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Thus, our findings indicate that the decrease in Treg closely correlates with the increase in apoptotic CD8(+) T cells and disease progression in chronic HIV-1 infection, and that Treg may play a key role in maintaining the balance between the amount and quality of CD8(+) T cells in HIV-1 infection. Manipulation of Treg function may be a promising strategy for immune therapy of this disease."

Doc No.492,1900,negative/unlabeled,9.3585205,T cells with a CD4+CD25+ regulatory phenotype suppress in vitro proliferation of virus-specific CD8+ T cells during chronic hepatitis C virus infection.,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with impaired proliferative, cytokine, and cytotoxic effector functions of HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells that probably contribute significantly to viral persistence. Here, we investigated the potential role of T cells with a CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory phenotype in suppressing virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell proliferation during chronic HCV infection. In vitro depletion studies and coculture experiments revealed that peptide specific proliferation as well as gamma interferon production of HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells were inhibited by CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells. This inhibition was dose dependent, required direct cell-cell contact, and was independent of interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor beta. Interestingly, the T-cell-mediated suppression in chronically HCV-infected patients was not restricted to HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells but also to influenza virus-specific CD8(+) T cells. Importantly, CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells from persons recovered from HCV infection and from healthy blood donors exhibited significantly less suppressor activity. Thus, the inhibition of virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell proliferation was enhanced in chronically HCV-infected patients. This was associated with a higher frequency of circulating CD4(+)CD25(+) cells observed in this patient group. Taken together, our results suggest that chronic HCV infection leads to the expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells that are able to suppress CD8(+) T-cell responses to different viral antigens. Our results further suggest that CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells may contribute to viral persistence in chronically HCV-infected patients and may be a target for immunotherapy of chronic hepatitis C."
Doc No.493,7954,positive/labeled,9.340667,The magnitude and breadth of hepatitis C virus-specific CD8+ T cells depend on absolute CD4+ T-cell count in individuals coinfected with HIV-1.,"CD8(+) T-cell responses are an essential antiviral host defense in persistent viral infections, and their sustained effectiveness is thought to be critically dependent on CD4(+) T-helper cells. To determine the relationship between HIV-1-induced CD4(+) T-cell depletion and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses during viral persistence, we studied 103 persons positive for HCV, 74 coinfected with HIV-1. CD8(+) T-cell responses to the entire HCV polyprotein were determined by using an interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay. Although HIV-1 infection by itself was not associated with a diminished HCV-specific response, HIV-1-associated CD4(+) depletion was associated with significantly lower HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells (R = 0.48, P < .0001). In contrast, declining CD4(+) counts over the same range were not associated with diminished Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)- (R = 0.19, P = .31) or HIV-1-specific (R = -0.13, P = .60) CD8(+) T-cell responses in persons infected with all viruses. These data indicate that frequencies of circulating HCV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses are sensitive to absolute CD4(+) T-cell counts and provide a possible explanation for the accelerated HCV disease course in persons coinfected with HIV-1 and HCV."

In order to characterize further these factors, we analyzed gene expression profiles of activated CD8(+) T-cells using a human cDNA expression array containing 588 human cDNAs. mRNA for the chemokine I-309 (CCL1), the cytokines granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-13, and natural killer cell enhancing factors (NKEF) -A and -B were up-regulated in bulk CD8(+) T-cells from HIV-1 seropositive individuals compared with seronegative individuals. Recombinant NKEF-A and NKEF-B inhibited HIV-1 replication when exogenously added to acutely infected T-cells at an ID(50) (dose inhibiting HIV-1 replication by 50%) of approximately 130 nm (3 microg/ml). Additionally, inhibition against dual-tropic simian immunodeficiency virus and dual-tropic simian-human immunodeficiency virus was found. T-cells transfected with NKEF-A or NKEF-B cDNA were able to inhibit 80-98% HIV-1 replication in vitro. Elevated plasma levels of both NKEF-A and NKEF-B proteins were detected in 23% of HIV-infected non-treated individuals but not in persons treated with highly active antiviral therapy or uninfected persons. These results indicate that the peroxiredoxin family members NKEF-A and NKEF-B are up-regulated in activated CD8(+) T-cells in HIV infection, and suggest that these antioxidant proteins contribute to the antiviral activity of CD8(+) T-cells."

We measured inflammation biomarker levels in 158 predominantly virologically suppressed adults on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a range of body mass index (BMI) values from normal to morbidly obese. We assessed the relationship between BMI and each biomarker using multivariable linear regression adjusted for age, sex, race, CD4(+) count, tobacco use, data source, protease inhibitor use, and routine nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) or aspirin use. Among normal-weight (n=48) and overweight participants (n=41; BMI <30 kg/m(2)), incremental BMI increases were associated with significantly higher serum highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP; β=2.47, p=0.02) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α receptor 1 levels (β=1.53, p=0.03), and significantly lower CD14 levels (β=0.84, p=0.01), but similar associations were not observed in the obese participants. Among the obese (n=69; BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)), however, higher serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6; β=1.30, p=0.02) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (β=1.77, p<0.01) were associated with higher BMI, a finding not observed among the nonobese. Among all participants, IL-6 and TNF-α receptor 1 levels were most closely associated with hsCRP (p<0.01). Further studies are needed to determine whether higher serum inflammation biomarker levels found in obese HIV-infected individuals on ART reflect an increased likelihood of adverse health outcomes, or if novel markers to estimate mortality and disease risk are needed in this population."

Poor retention in clinical care has been associated with higher mortality, an increase in HIV RNA, and decreased CD4 cell count. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the health care utilization and health outcomes of HIV-infected racial/ethnic minority YMSM enrolled in an outreach, linkage, and retention study funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB). We hypothesized that among racial/ethnic minority YMSM, baseline CD4 counts and usage of ART are influenced by age, race, drug and alcohol use, and mental health symptoms. Overall, 155 subjects had at least a baseline CD4 count recorded at study entry. There was a low rate of ART use in this population with only one-half of the cohort with CD4 counts ≤ 350 cells/mm(3) being prescribed ART to treat their infection. However, of those youth who were started on ART, the majority (74%) did achieve undetectable viral loads (< 400 copies). Given the continued increase in cases of HIV infection among racial/ethnic minority YMSM, efforts to increase both the provision of ART and support services that encourage adherence in this population are warranted."
Doc No.497,3727,negative/unlabeled,9.32043,HIV-1 drug resistance: degree of underestimation by a cross-sectional versus a longitudinal testing approach.,"Genotyping of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) for antiretroviral drug resistance is routinely used both in clinical practice, to guide the selection of options for an individual's antiretroviral therapy, and in epidemiological studies, to estimate levels of antiretroviral drug resistance in a patient population. However, reliance on results of a single test can result in an underestimation of antiretroviral drug resistance. In the present study, we quantified the prevalence of resistance-associated mutations found in recent genotypic tests of 1734 HIV-1-infected, treatment-experienced subjects who had at least 3 genotypic tests (n = 11,404 genotypic tests total; median, 5 tests/subject) and compared it with that of resistance-associated mutations ever detected in these subjects between 1996 and 2004. Single-point analyses underestimated antiretroviral drug resistance, particularly for nucleoside analogues, in both individuals and patient populations. For example, the prevalence of resistance-associated mutation M184V/I was 25.5% in the most recent genotypes and 58.8% in available historical genotypes. Our results suggest that analysis of a combined historical genotype rather than of a cross-sectional genotype may lead to more accurate estimates of antiretroviral drug resistance in individual patients and in patient populations."

Testing of CAF activity against autologous viruses isolated at approximately the same time points showed that CD8+ T lymphocytes from long-term survivors indeed possessed high CAF activity. However, in four of six progressors to AIDS, we observed the same amount of CAF activity in the face of increasing cellular HIV-1 load. In the other two progressors, CAF activity seemed preserved over time whereas the susceptibility of the virus isolate obtained late in infection seemed to be diminished. In a heterologous system, CAF activity of CD8+ T lymphocytes from 13 HIV-1-positive individuals did not correlate with CD4+ T lymphocyte counts. In two of three patients, syncytium-inducing (SI) HIV-1 variants, which are associated with a progressive clinical course, appeared to have a somewhat reduced susceptibility to CAF activity as compared to their coexisting non-SI HIV-1 variants. In a large donor group, suppression of SI isolates (as compared to non-SI isolates) mediated by heterologous CD8+ T lymphocytes was reduced. CD8+ T lymphocytes from five of six HIV-1-positive individuals suppressed HIV-1 replication in macrophages. CD8+ T lymphocytes from noninfected donors, even from cord blood, already had high CAF activity, suggesting that induction of this activity is neither virus nor HIV-1 specific."

The BZLF1 gene product caused an 18-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity from an HIV-1 LTR lacZ expression vector, whereas the HIV-1 transactivator tat caused a 44-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity. When cells were transfected with both BZLF1 (pEBV-Z) and tat (pTAT3) expression vectors, as well as HIV-1 LTR lacZ plasmid (pLRON), a 214-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity was observed. This result suggests a synergistic effect of BZLF1 and tat on HIV-1 LTR-directed lacZ gene expression. Analysis of quantitative BZLF1 and tat requirements for maximal HIV-1 LTR activation indicates that BZLF1 does not reduce the amount of tat required for maximal LTR activation, as would be expected if the BZLF1 synergistic effect was due to increased tat gene expression. Thus, coordinate effects of BZLF1 and tat on the HIV-1 LTR or its transcript are probably responsible for synergistic HIV-1 LTR activation."

This is a qualitative cross-sectional study of HIV-positive postpartum women (n = 112) enrolled in a 2-year observational prospective cohort in Rwanda. Informed by the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), we conducted in-depth interviews with women whose children were 0-6, 7-12, 13-18, or 21-24 months of age to describe factors contributing to adherence and changes over time. Positive ART attitudes reported by women included mothers' health promotion, prevention of infant HIV infection, higher CD4 count, and improved physical appearance. Negative attitudes were few, but included side effects and the lifelong nature of treatment. Learning from people living with HIV (PLHIV) was identified as a norm facilitating adherence; ART adherence was inhibited by fear of disclosure or stigmatization in communities and clinics. Poor adherence behaviors were common immediately after HIV diagnosis, not necessarily during prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). Women with older children, most of whom stopped breastfeeding by 13-18 months, reported more barriers and missed doses than women with younger children. The TRA was useful in identifying the collective influence of attitudes, norms, and intentions on behavior. Findings suggest that HIV-positive women are vulnerable to poor adherence following HIV diagnosis and around the time of breastfeeding cessation. Lifelong treatment adherence can be supported through PLHIV exemplifying long-term ART use, fewer and less stigmatizing clinic visits, and counseling messages highlighting the benefits of drugs on appearance and illness prevention and incorporating biological feedback."
Doc No.501,2644,negative/unlabeled,9.311347,Structural and functional constraints limit options for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte escape in the immunodominant HLA-B27-restricted epitope in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 capsid.,"Control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by HLA-B27-positive subjects has been linked to an immunodominant CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response targeting the conserved KK10 epitope (KRWIILGLNK(263-272)) in p24/Gag. Viral escape in KK10 typically occurs through development of an R(264)K substitution in conjunction with the upstream compensatory mutation S(173)A, and the difficulty of the virus to escape from the immune response against the KK10 epitope until late in infection has been associated with slower clinical progression. Rare alternative escape mutations at R(264) have been observed, but factors dictating the preferential selection of R(264)K remain unclear. Here we illustrate that while all observed R(264) mutations (K, G, Q, and T) reduced peptide binding to HLA-B27 and impaired viral replication, the replicative defects of the alternative mutants were actually less pronounced than those for R(264)K. Importantly, however, none of these mutants replicated as well as an R(264)K variant containing the compensatory mutation S(173)A. In assessing the combined effects of viral replication and CTL escape using an in vitro coculture assay, we further observed that the compensated R(264)K mutant also displayed the highest replication capacity in the presence of KK10-specific CTLs. Comparisons of codon usage for the respective variants indicated that generation of the R(264)K mutation may also be favored due to a G-to-A bias in nucleotide substitutions during HIV-1 replication. Together, these data suggest that the preference for R(264)K is due primarily to the ability of the S(173)A-compensated virus to replicate better than alternative variants in the presence of CTLs, suggesting that viral fitness is a key contributor for the selection of immune escape variants."
Doc No.502,5499,negative/unlabeled,9.308125,New insights into the neuroimmunity of SIV infection by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"(1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was employed to noninvasively monitor neuronal injury in eight rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), whose immune system was compromised by CD8 T lymphocyte depletion and treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). SIV infection and CD8 depletion resulted in a rapid decline in cerebral N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels, a sensitive marker of neuronal health. Within 3 months of SIV infection and CD8 depletion, four animals developed AIDS and severe SIV encephalitis. The other four macaques underwent daily doses of HAART beginning 4 weeks after infection/CD8 depletion. HAART involved drugs that do not penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) including 9-[2(R)-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine and a racemic mixture of D: -L: -enantiomers of 2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'thiacytidine. HAART resulted in reversal of NAA/Cr decline after 4 weeks of therapy, and no virus or encephalitis was found in brain samples analyzed. These results indicate that the CNS injury in AIDS is entirely dependent on events involving the peripheral immune system mediated by trafficking of SIV-infected monocytes into the brain. The rapid decline in NAA/Cr with SIV infection/CD8 depletion and its rapid recovery with HAART suggest that: (1) infected monocyte turnover in the CNS is rapid, occurring in days to weeks; (2) there are endogenous mechanisms that reverse neuronal injury; and (3) a threshold level of infected monocytes/macrophages in the CNS is required to overcome the neuronal recovery processes. These observations explain the clinical success of antiretroviral therapy in reducing the incidence of HIV-associated dementia and minor cognitive/motor disorder and suggest novel targets for drug development."
Doc No.503,5342,negative/unlabeled,9.305714,Conflicting interpretations of the prevalence of mutations associated with drug resistance in antiviral naïve HIV-1 patients with acute and chronic infection.,"The routine determination of drug resistance in newly HIV-1 infected individuals records a potential increase in transmissions of drug-resistant variants. Plasma samples from 38 individuals classified as newly infected (seroconversion time <12 months) and twenty four individuals with an established infection (seroconversion time ranging from 3 to 10 years) were analyzed for the presence of mutations by Trugene HIV-1 genotyping assay and Virtual phenotype. Results on the newly infected and the chronically infected individuals showed a limited number of relevant mutations associated with substantial resistance to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. In particular, three patients (4.8%) carried viral major mutations (T69D and M41L) associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors, whereas only one showed the presence of M46L, which is correlated with partial resistance to some protease inhibitors. The clinical interpretation based on different approaches to monitor resistance showed that the Virconet interpretation was less grave than Trugene, suggesting that these interpretations need standardization for the currently used sequencing methods and that they may be associated with different outcomes when eventually are used."
Doc No.504,3787,negative/unlabeled,9.305389,The role of T helper 17 cells in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus-related liver cirrhosis (Review).,"In chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients, T helper 17 (Th17) cells are significantly elevated. Th17 cells initiate immune‑mediated pathogenesis and have a critical role in the process of HBV‑related liver cirrhosis (HBV‑LC). The mechanisms underlying this process are attributed to Th17‑secreted cytokines, which include interleukin (IL)‑17, IL‑21 and IL‑22; however, a systemic analysis regarding these mechanisms has yet to be conducted. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of HBV‑LC. All randomized clinical trials, case series, case reports and meta‑analyses that contained the aforementioned keywords were included in the review process. In addition, unpublished information from the Food and Drug Administration was included. The findings indicated that Th17‑secreted cytokines, including IL‑17, IL‑21 and IL‑22, function by activating or silencing hepatic stellate cells, modulating proinflammatory and pro‑ or antifibrogenic effectors, regulating extracellular matrix formation, upregulating chemokine expression, and inducing hepatocellular damage or hepatoprotection during the HBV‑LC process. In addition, Th17 cells and Th17‑secreted cytokines may be considered a potential tool in the diagnosis or treatment of HBV‑LC. The present review summarized the role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of HBV‑LC in order to deepen the clinical understanding of the role of Th17 cells and also to support the development of effective therapies for patients with HBV‑LC."
Doc No.505,8478,positive/labeled,9.302833,Factors associated with adherence to antiretroviral therapy.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of sociodemographic characteristics, patient perceptions, and patient characteristics including spirituality, self-reported adherence, and highly active antiretroviral therapy. The convenience sample consisted of 120 English-speaking adults (60% male, 35% female, 5% transgendered) with HIV/AIDS from two HIV service agencies in a large metropolitan city in the southeastern United States. The mean self-reported adherence was 83.1% (SD = 15.7%). Adherence was significantly correlated with perceived support and absence of barriers, strong intentions to adhere, perceived effectiveness of the medications, higher levels of perceived general health, fewer years of HIV disease, and fewer years on antiretroviral medications. Existential well-being (e.g., viewing life as positive and having meaning) was a weak significant correlate. Backward regression analysis was conducted to identify a parsimonious model of predictors of adherence. The final model included presence of support and absence of barriers, fewer years of HIV infection, no current alcohol use, perceived severity of HIV, existential well-being, and male gender. This model explained 19.4% of the variance in adherence (observed F[6, 100] = 5.6, p < .0001)."
Doc No.506,3769,negative/unlabeled,9.296231,Hepatitis C virus drug resistance and immune-driven adaptations: relevance to new antiviral therapy.,"The efficacy of specifically targeted anti-viral therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) (STAT-C), including HCV protease and polymerase inhibitors, is limited by the presence of drug-specific viral resistance mutations within the targeted proteins. Genetic diversity within these viral proteins also evolves under selective pressures provided by host human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted immune responses, which may therefore influence STAT-C treatment response. Here, the prevalence of drug resistance mutations relevant to 27 developmental STAT-C drugs, and the potential for drug and immune selective pressures to intersect at sites along the HCV genome, is explored. HCV nonstructural (NS) 3 protease or NS5B polymerase sequences and HLA assignment were obtained from study populations from Australia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Four hundred five treatment-naïve individuals with chronic HCV infection were considered (259 genotype 1, 146 genotype 3), of which 38.5% were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We identified preexisting STAT-C drug resistance mutations in sequences from this large cohort. The frequency of the variations varied according to individual STAT-C drug and HCV genotype/subtype. Of individuals infected with subtype 1a, 21.5% exhibited genetic variation at a known drug resistance site. Furthermore, we identified areas in HCV protease and polymerase that are under both potential HLA-driven pressure and therapy selection and identified six HLA-associated polymorphisms (P <or= 0.05) at known drug resistance sites."
Doc No.507,6806,negative/unlabeled,9.294461,Resistance mutational analysis of HIV type 1 subtype C among rural South African drug-naive patients prior to large-scale availability of antiretrovirals.,"Baseline HIV-1 resistance data are important for resistance monitoring purposes especially in regions initiating large-scale antiretroviral treatment programs. We examined 40 protease and 35 reverse transcriptase amino acid sequences of HIV-1 subtype C from drug inexperienced patients from rural settings in South Africa for resistance mutations. Samples were collected between 2001 and 2004 prior to the availability of antiretrovirals through public health institutions. Ninety-five percent of patients had no major mutations in the protease gene, although substitutions M46L (2.5%) and G73S (2.5%), which according to the Stanford Genotypic Resistance Interpretation Algorithm are considered major mutations, were detected. In addition, a high prevalence of minor mutations was observed in the protease, with at least three minor resistance-associated mutations in 37% of the isolates. An isoleucine insertion at codon 37 was detected in one sequence. Most of the RT sequences were wild-type, although V118I (8.5%) and Y318F (5.7%) associated with resistance to lamivudine and nevirapine, respectively, were observed. Our data suggest that major resistance mutations among the drug-inexperienced population in South Africa may be rare, and routine resistance testing before the initiation of therapy in this initial stage of the treatment program may not be necessary."

In those with OPC, CD8+ T cells accumulate at the lamina propria-epithelium interface at a distance from the organism at the outer epithelium. The present study aimed to characterize the tissue-associated CD8+ T cells and tissue microenvironment in both OPC+ and OPC- persons. The results show that the majority of CD8+ T cells possess the alphabeta T-cell receptor, the thymus-derived alphabeta CD8 antigen heterodimer, and similar levels of the alpha(4)beta(7), alpha(4)beta(1), and alpha(e)beta(7) homing receptors. Studies to evaluate the tissue microenvironment showed that in OPC+ persons, the adhesion molecule for T cells to enter mucosa, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule, is significantly increased, whereas E-cadherin, which allows T cells to migrate through mucosa, is significantly decreased compared to OPC- persons. These results continue to support a role for CD8+ T cells against OPC under conditions of reduced numbers of CD4+T cells, with susceptibility to infection potentially associated with a dysfunction in mucosal CD8+ T-cell migration by reduced tissue-associated E-cadherin."

Usually, the diagnosis of such viruses employs serological assays; however, some difficulties in confirming HTLV-2 infection have been reported in high-risk populations in Brazil. We present data of an unusual case of coinfection with HIV-1, HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HCV in a male IDU in which HTLV-2 was detected only by molecular assays. Comparative analysis of retroviruses from 2002 and 2012 showed identical HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 sequences (LTR, env, and tax), and a change in HIV-1 tropism from CXCR4 to CCR5. No mutation was detected in the hot points of the env region of the HTLV-2 isolate that justified the lack of rgp46-II-specific antibodies. These data emphasize the need for molecular assays to diagnose HTLV-2 in high-risk populations in Brazil."

An ensuing influx of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells, which persist throughout the chronic phase of infection, has also been documented in the gastrointestinal tract. However, little is known of the functionality of these effector cells or their relationship to the disease course. In this study, we measured CD8(+) T-cell responses to HIV-1 peptides in paired rectal and blood samples from chronically infected patients. In both blood and rectum, there was an immunodominant CD8(+) T-cell response to HIV Gag compared to Pol and Env (P < 0.01). In contrast, cytomegalovirus pp65 peptides elicited gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) secretion strongly in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) but weakly in rectal CD8(+) T cells (P = 0.015). Upon stimulation with HIV peptides, CD8(+) T cells from both sites were capable of mounting complex responses including degranulation (CD107 expression) and IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production. In rectal tissue, CD107 release was frequently coupled with production of IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha. In patients not on antiretroviral therapy, the magnitude of Gag-specific responses, as a percentage of CD8(+) T cells, was greater in the rectal mucosa than in PBMC (P = 0.054); however, the breakdown of responding cells into specific functional categories was similar in both sites. These findings demonstrate that rectal CD8(+) T cells are capable of robust and varied HIV-1-specific responses and therefore likely play an active role in eliminating infected cells during chronic infection."

Amplification of at least one gene was successful for 144 isolates. All three genes were obtained for 136 isolates. Subtyping showed that CRF01_AE was predominant (130 cases). According to the ANRS September 2004 list, polymorphism substitutions (>50% versus the subtype B consensus) of CRF01_AE at drug resistance positions were observed only in protease: I13V (81%), E35D (87%), M36I (100%), R41K (96%), and H69K (100%). Two strains bore one major resistance mutation to PIs: M46I and N88D. Five other strains carried drug resistance mutations to RTIs: K70R (one strain), V75M (three strains), and K101E (one strain). Of the isolates 4.9% had drug resistance mutations to antiretroviral drugs."
Doc No.512,268,negative/unlabeled,9.270386,Factors influencing T-cell turnover in HIV-1-seropositive patients.,"HIV-1 disease is associated with pathological effects on T-cell production, destruction, and distribution. Using the deuterated (2H) glucose method for endogenous labeling, we have analyzed host factors that influence T-cell turnover in HIV-1-uninfected and -infected humans. In untreated HIV-1 disease, the average half life of circulating T cells was diminished without compensatory increases in cell production. Within 12 weeks of the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the absolute production rates of circulating T cells increased, and normal half-lives and production rates were restored by 12-36 months. Interpatient heterogeneity in the absolute degree of turnover correlated with the relative proportion of naive- and memory/effector-phenotype T cells in each of the CD4+ and CD8+ populations. The half-lives of naive-phenotype T cells ranged from 116-365 days (fractional replacement rates of 0.19-0.60% per day), whereas memory/effector-phenotype T cells persisted with half-lives from 22-79 days (fractional replacement rates of 0.87-3.14% per day). Naive-phenotype T cells were more abundant, and the half-life of total T cells was prolonged in individuals with abundant thymic tissue, as assessed by computed tomography. Such interpatient variation in T-cell kinetics may be reflective of differences in functional immune reconstitution after treatment for HIV-1 disease."

We now report that pX17 synthesized in Escherichia coli can activate transcription controlled by the HIV-1 LTR using a protoplast fusion technique. Protoplasts of E. coli-containing presynthesized X-protein were fused with lymphocytic H938 cells harboring an integrated copy of a plasmid with the CAT gene under control of the HIV-1 LTR (HIV-1 LTR CAT) and a marked increase in the steady state expression of the CAT mRNA was observed. When the same fused cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide, the pX17-dependent activation of the HIV-1 LTR was abolished. This result indicates that the X-protein expressed in E. coli is biologically active and suggests that the HBV X-protein-mediated trans-activation of the HIV-1 LTR in this system requires de novo cellular protein synthesis."
Doc No.514,9954,negative/unlabeled,9.251555,The T cell response to persistent herpes virus infections in common variable immunodeficiency.,"We show that at least half of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) have circulating CD8(+) T cells specific for epitopes derived from cytomegalovirus (CMV) and/or the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Compared to healthy age-matched subjects, more CD8(+) T cells in CVID patients were committed to CMV. Despite previous reports of defects in antigen presentation and cellular immunity in CVID, specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells produced interferon (IFN)-gamma after stimulation with CMV peptides, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells secreted perforin in response to these antigens. In CVID patients we found an association between a high percentage of circulating CD8(+) CD57(+) T cells containing perforin, CMV infection and a low CD4/CD8 ratio, suggesting that CMV may have a major role in the T cell abnormalities described previously in this disease. We also show preliminary evidence that CMV contributes to the previously unexplained severe enteropathy that occurs in about 5% of patients."
Doc No.515,7945,negative/unlabeled,9.243695,Long-acting slow effective release antiretroviral therapy.,"Advances in long-acting antiretroviral therapy (ART) can revolutionize current HIV/AIDS treatments. We coined the term 'long-acting slow effective release ART' (LASER ART) to highlight the required formulation properties of slow drug dissolution, poor water-solubility, bioavailability, little-to-no off-target toxicities and improved regimen adherence. Drug carrier technologies characterized by high antiretroviral drug (ARV) payloads in a single carrier improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. The surface modifications of ARV carriers target monocyte-macrophages and facilitate drug transport across physiological barriers and to virus-susceptible CD4 + T cells. Areas covered: The review highlights developments of reservoir-targeted LASER ART for improved therapeutic outcomes. Such nanoART delivery platforms include decorated multifunctional nano- and micro-particles, prodrugs and polymer conjugates. Therapeutic strategies such as gene-editing technologies boost ART effectiveness. Expert opinion: The persistence of HIV-1 in lymphoid, gut and nervous system reservoirs poses a challenge to viral eradication. Emerging slow-release drug carriers can target intracellular pathogens, activate antiviral immunity, promote genome editing, sustain drug depots and combine therapeutics with image contrast agents, and can meet unmet clinical needs for HIV-infected patients. Such efforts will bring the medicines to reservoir sites and accelerate viral clearance."

Patient Care Committee & Adherence Working Group of the Outcomes Committee of the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG).,"This paper describes the AACTG Adherence Instruments, which are comprised of two self-report questionnaires for use in clinical trials conducted by the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG). The questionnaires were administered to 75 patients at ten AACTG sites in the USA. All patients were taking combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), including at least one protease inhibitor. Eleven per cent of patients reported missing at least one dose the day before the interview, and 17% reported missing at least one dose during the two days prior. The most common reasons for missing medications included 'simply forgot' (66%) and a number of factors often associated with improved health, including being busy (53%), away from home (57%) and changes in routine (51%). Less adherent patients reported lower adherence self-efficacy (p = 0.006) and were less sure of the link between non-adherence and the development of drug resistance (p = 0.009). They were also more likely to consume alcohol, to be employed outside the home for pay and to have enrolled in clinical trials to gain access to drugs (all p < 0.05). Twenty-two per cent of patients taking drugs requiring special instructions were unaware of these instructions. Each questionnaire took approximately ten minutes to complete. Responses to the questionnaires were favourable. These questionnaires have been included in six AACTG clinical trials to date and have been widely disseminated to investigators both in the USA and abroad."

Presumably these cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). To further delineate the interactions between HIV-1 and host cells, the susceptibility and permissivity of normal human peripheral blood-derived monocyte/macrophages (M/M) and T lymphocytes, and neoplastic monocytoid and lymphoid cell lines to various HIV-1 isolates was assessed. The results suggest: (1) ""fresh"" isolates recovered from patients and propagated only in normal host cells exhibit a dual tropism for both M/M and T cells, regardless of their tissue of origin or the cell type from which they were isolated; (2) the repeated passage of an HIV-1 isolate through normal M/M does not generally result in the loss of the ability to infect normal T cells nor vice versa; (3) the majority of fresh HIV-1 isolates do not infect neoplastic cells of either origin, and those that do show no preference for monocytoid or lymphoid targets, regardless of their cell origin."

None of the samples had major ENF resistance mutations. Six (3.4%) samples had minor ENF resistance mutations in the HR1 region (V38G, N43K, L44M, L45M). Twenty-eight (16%) samples had the N42S polymorphism, which is associated with ENF hypersusceptibility. Accessory mutations in the HR2 region were identified in some samples (E137K, S138A). Five of the six samples with HR1 resistance mutations were analyzed with a phenotypic assay; one sample had reduced ENF susceptibility (a sample with N42S +L44M + E137K). Prior to the availability of ENF, some men in the United States were infected with HIV that contained mutations associated with ENF resistance or hypersusceptibility. However, most of the mutations were not associated with phenotypic ENF resistance."

Our previous studies demonstrated that CD8 T cells from chronically infected patients with high virus load proliferated poorly in response to interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine critical in CD8 T cell growth and differentiation, even though relatively high levels of IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) were expressed. This suggested that signal transduction defects in response to IL-2 might be involved. The STAT5 transcription factor is important in IL-2-dependent biological responses and it is known that there are defects in unstimulated CD3 and CD4 cells in HIV-infected patients."
Doc No.520,751,negative/unlabeled,9.189715,Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication by regulated expression of a polymeric Tat activation response RNA decoy as a strategy for gene therapy in AIDS.,"We are investigating a strategy for somatic gene therapy to treat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection by intracellular expression of an RNA decoy and a ribozyme. The RNA decoy, consisting of polymeric Tat activation response elements (TARs), is designed to compete for Tat binding in an equilibrium with viral TAR RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication. The expression of polymeric TAR is regulated by the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) and transcriptional activation is dependent on the presence of HIV Tat. Our initial studies indicated that plasmids expressing up to 50 tandem copies of TAR RNA (50TAR) inhibited tat-mediated gene expression by > 90% in a transient transfection assay. A HIV LTR-driven 50TAR construct was subcloned into a replication-defective retroviral vector to ensure high-efficiency gene transfer into T lymphocytes. In addition, a gag RNA-specific ribozyme gene was introduced into the 50TAR containing retroviral vector to enhance the inhibitory effect of the construct (designated TAR-Rib). A human T-cell line (Molt3) was infected (transduced) with the TAR-Rib recombinant retrovirus and challenged with either HIV-1 or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). HIV-1 replication was inhibited by 99% in the TAR-Rib-transduced T cells and was maintained over a 14-month period, suggesting that this antiviral strategy represses the formation of escape mutants. Interestingly, the TAR-Rib also inhibited SIV replication in transduced T cells, which suggests that polymeric TAR is a general inhibitor of primate lentiviruses; therefore, the macaque model could be used for further in vivo testing of this antiviral gene therapy strategy."
Doc No.521,308,negative/unlabeled,9.18742,Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients with and without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.,"Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials were recorded in 35 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive subjects from the Centers for Disease Control groups III and IV, 24 HIV-negative drug abusers, and 62 normal healthy controls. None of the patients had evidence of neurological complications. History of alcohol consumption was an exclusion criterion. The values of central conduction times I-V and III-V showed significant differences between the HIV-seropositive subjects and normal healthy controls, as well as between the HIV-seropositive subjects and HIV-negative drug abusers. Central conduction times I-III showed no differences between groups, except in the left ear of Centers for Disease Control group IV compared with controls. No statistical differences were found in the central conduction times between HIV-negative drug abusers and normal healthy controls. The results suggest a subclinical involvement of the upper brain stem in HIV infection. It could be produced by direct action of the virus on central nervous system structures."
Doc No.522,192,negative/unlabeled,9.1830435,PD-1 expression on HIV-specific T cells is associated with T-cell exhaustion and disease progression.,"Functional impairment of T cells is characteristic of many chronic mouse and human viral infections. The inhibitory receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1; also known as PDCD1), a negative regulator of activated T cells, is markedly upregulated on the surface of exhausted virus-specific CD8 T cells in mice. Blockade of this pathway using antibodies against the PD ligand 1 (PD-L1, also known as CD274) restores CD8 T-cell function and reduces viral load. To investigate the role of PD-1 in a chronic human viral infection, we examined PD-1 expression on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific CD8 T cells in 71 clade-C-infected people who were naive to anti-HIV treatments, using ten major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I tetramers specific for frequently targeted epitopes. Here we report that PD-1 is significantly upregulated on these cells, and expression correlates with impaired HIV-specific CD8 T-cell function as well as predictors of disease progression: positively with plasma viral load and inversely with CD4 T-cell count. PD-1 expression on CD4 T cells likewise showed a positive correlation with viral load and an inverse correlation with CD4 T-cell count, and blockade of the pathway augmented HIV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell function. These data indicate that the immunoregulatory PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is operative during a persistent viral infection in humans, and define a reversible defect in HIV-specific T-cell function. Moreover, this pathway of reversible T-cell impairment provides a potential target for enhancing the function of exhausted T cells in chronic HIV infection."
Doc No.523,5363,negative/unlabeled,9.181822,Activated peripheral CD8 lymphocytes express CD4 in vivo and are targets for infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"There is increasing evidence that CD8 lymphocytes may represent targets for infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in vivo whose destruction may contribute to the loss of immune function underlying AIDS. HIV-1 may infect thymic precursor cells destined to become CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes and contribute to the numerical decline in both subsets on disease progression. There is also evidence for the induction of CD4 expression and susceptibility to infection by HIV-1 of CD8 lymphocytes activated in vitro. To investigate the relationship between CD8 activation and infection by HIV-1 in vivo, activated subsets of CD8 lymphocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HIV-seropositive individuals were investigated for CD4 expression and HIV infection. Activated CD8 lymphocytes were identified by expression of CD69, CD71, and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II, the beta-chain of CD8, and the RO isoform of CD45. CD4(+) and CD4(-) CD8 lymphocytes, CD4 lymphocytes, other T cells, and non-T cells were purified using paramagnetic beads, and proviral sequences were quantified by PCR using primers from the long terminal repeat region. Frequencies of activated CD8 lymphocytes were higher in HIV-infected study subjects than in seronegative controls, and they frequently coexpressed CD4 (mean frequencies on CD69(+), CD71(+), and HLA class II(+) cells of 23, 37, and 8%, respectively, compared with 1 to 2% for nonactivated CD8 lymphocytes). The level of CD4 expression of the double-positive population approached that of mature CD4 lymphocytes. That CD4 expression renders CD8 cell susceptible to infection was indicated by their high frequency of infection in vivo; infected CD4(+) CD8 lymphocytes accounted for between 3 and 72% of the total proviral load in PBMCs from five of the eight study subjects investigated, despite these cells representing a small component of the PBMC population (<3%). Combined, these findings provide evidence that antigenic stimulation of CD8 lymphocytes in vivo induces CD4 expression that renders them susceptible to HIV infection and destruction. The specific targeting of responding CD8 lymphocytes may provide a functional explanation for the previously observed impairment of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) function disproportionate to their numerical decline in AIDS and for the deletion of specific clones of CTLs responding to HIV antigens."
Doc No.524,7484,negative/unlabeled,9.175633,"Human immunodeficiency virus-driven expansion of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells, which suppress HIV-specific CD4 T-cell responses in HIV-infected patients.","The present study demonstrates that CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells, expanded in peripheral blood of HIV-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), exhibit phenotypic, molecular, and functional characteristics of regulatory T cells. The majority of peripheral CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells from HIV-infected patients expressed a memory phenotype. They were found to constitutively express transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) messengers. CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells weakly proliferated to immobilized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and addition of soluble anti-CD28 mAb significantly increased proliferation. In contrast to CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells, CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells from HIV-infected patients did not proliferate in response to recall antigens and to p24 protein. The proliferative capacity of CD4 T cells to tuberculin, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and p24 significantly increased following depletion of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells. Furthermore, addition of increasing numbers of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of CD4(+)CD25(-) T-cell proliferation to tuberculin and p24. CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells responded specifically to p24 antigen stimulation by expressing transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and interleukin 10 (IL-10), thus indicating the presence of p24-specific CD4(+) T cells among the CD4(+)CD25(+) T-cell subset. Suppressive activity was not dependent on the secretion of TGF-beta or IL-10. Taken together, our results suggest that persistence of HIV antigens might trigger the expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells, which might induce a tolerance to HIV in vivo."
Doc No.525,1510,positive/labeled,9.168683,Genotypic analysis of HIV-1 drug resistance at the limit of detection: virus production without evolution in treated adults with undetectable HIV loads.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) production continues in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with undetectable (<50 copies/mL) virus loads. Our initial cross-sectional study showed that this viremia is composed of viruses that lack new resistance mutations to the HAART regimen. Here we describe a longitudinal, clonal genotypic analysis of plasma virus loads in treated adults who had undetectable virus loads. We document a continuous production of virus in 8 HIV-1-infected adults who maintained suppression of viremia for up to 15 months. Using analytical approaches for distinguishing selected resistance mutations from nonselected mutations and polymerase chain reaction errors, we detected no evolution of resistance in the reverse-transcriptase and protease genes. Sporadic resistance mutations were detected in some viral clones that were not selected for subsequently. Thus, in some patients, HAART suppresses replication to a level that does not allow the evolution of drug resistance over a time frame of years."
Doc No.526,5703,negative/unlabeled,9.155068,Short Communication: Population-Based Surveillance of HIV-1 Drug Resistance in Cameroonian Adults Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy According to the World Health Organization Guidelines.,"With ongoing earlier enrollment on and rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cameroon, there are increasing risks of transmitted HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) at population levels. We, therefore, evaluated the threshold of HIVDR in a population initiating ART, to inform on the effectiveness of first-line regimens, considering HIV-1 diversity, plasma viral load (PVL), and CD4-based disease progression. A total of 53 adults [median (interquartile range, IQR) CD4: 162 cell/mm(3) (48-284); median (IQR) PVL: 5.34 log10 RNA (4.17-6.42) copies/ml] initiating ART in 2014 at the Yaoundé Central Hospital were enrolled for HIV-1 protease-reverse transcriptase sequencing. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were interpreted using the 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) list versus the Stanford HIVdb algorithm version 7.0. Level of DRMs was low (3.77%) versus moderate (7.55%), respectively, following the WHO list (T69D, K103N) versus Stanford HIVdb (T69D, A98G, K103N, K238T), respectively. Prevailing clade was CRF02_AG (71.70%). Based on Stanford HIVdb, a slightly higher proportion of patients with DRMs were found among ones infected with CRF02_AG than in those non-CRF02_AG infected (7.89% vs. 6.67%, p = 1.000), with lower PVL (7.69% <5.5 vs. 0% ≥5.5 log10 RNA copies/ml, p = .488) and with higher CD4 counts (9.52% CD4 ≥200 vs. 3.33% CD4 <200 cells/mm(3), p = .749). Thresholds of DRMs suggest that standard first-line regimens currently used in Cameroon may remain effective at population levels, despite scale-up of ART in the country, pending adherence, and closed virological monitoring. With an intent-to-diagnose approach, the discrepant levels of DRMs support using Stanford HIVdb to evaluate initial ART, while revising the WHO list for surveillance."
Doc No.527,4625,negative/unlabeled,9.14507,Functional correlates of insertion mutations in the protease gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolates from patients.,"Twenty-four of over 24,000 patients genotyped over the past 3 years were found to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates that possess an insert in the protease gene. In this report, we evaluated the spectrum of protease gene insertion mutations in patient isolates and analyzed the effect of these various insertion mutations on viral phenotypes. The inserts were composed of 1, 2, 5, or 6 amino acids that mapped at or between codons 35 and 38, 17 and 18, 21 and 25, or 95 and 96. Reduced susceptibility to protease inhibitors was found in isolates which possess previously reported drug resistance mutations. Fitness assays, including replication and competition experiments, showed that most of the isolates with inserts grew somewhat better than their counterparts with a deletion of the insert. These experiments demonstrate that, rarely, insertion mutations can develop in the HIV type 1 protease gene, are no more resistant than any other sequences which have similar associated resistance mutations, and can provide a borderline advantage in replication."
Doc No.528,3820,negative/unlabeled,9.144501,Multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strains resulting from combination antiretroviral therapy.,"Multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains with reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations at codons A62-->V, V75-->I, F77-->L, F116-->Y, and Q151-->M have been reported in patients receiving combination therapy with zidovudine (AZT) and didanosine (ddI). Infectious clones with each mutation alone, all five mutations together, and various combinations of mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation Q151-->M conferred partial resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine, whereas a combination of four mutations conferred increased resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine. The positions of residues 75, 77, and 151 in the three-dimensional crystal structure of HIV-1 RT suggest that these residues may affect the ability of the enzyme to discriminate between deoxynucleoside triphosphates and nucleoside analog RT inhibitors. Replication experiments showed that clones with mutation F77-->L but without V75-->I (HIV-1(77), HIV-1(77,151), and HIV-1(77,116,151) had attenuated growth compared with that of the original HIV-1NL4-3 strain and strains containing mutations at both positions 75 and 77 (HIV-1(75,77,151) and HIV-1(75,77,116,15)). Sequence analysis of viral RNA and proviral DNA from several patients indicated that RT mutations developed in a sequential and cumulative pattern over the course of a 2- to 4-year observation period. The present results suggest that drug resistance and viral replicative capacity both may play a role in selection of HIV-1 RT mutations."
Doc No.529,875,negative/unlabeled,9.142646,Expansion of CD8+ T cells lacking Sema4D/CD100 during HIV-1 infection identifies a subset of T cells with decreased functional capacity.,"Sema4D, also known as CD100, is a constitutively expressed immune semaphorin on T cells and NK cells. CD100 has important immune regulatory functions that improve antigen-specific priming by antigen-presenting cells, and can also act as a costimulatory molecule on T cells. We investigated the consequence of HIV-1 infection on CD100 expression by T cells, and whether CD100 expression signifies functionally competent effector cells. CD100 expression on T cells from healthy individuals was compared with HIV-1-infected subjects including elite controllers, noncontrollers, and patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The frequency and fluorescence intensity of CD100 on CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells were decreased during HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, the absolute number of CD100-expressing CD8(+) T cells was positively associated with the magnitude of HIV-1-specific T-cell responses. CD8(+) T cells lacking CD100 expression were functionally impaired and present in increased numbers in HIV-1-infected individuals. The number of CD100(-)CD8(+) T cells positively correlated with T-cell immunosenescence, immune activation, and viral load. Loss of CD100 expression appears to result from direct antigen stimulation, as in vitro cytokine exposure and viral replication did not significantly impact CD100 expression. These data suggest that loss of CD100 expression probably plays an important role in dysfunctional immunity in HIV-1 infection."
Doc No.530,4809,negative/unlabeled,9.130094,The L60V variation in hepatitis B virus core protein elicits new epitope-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and enhances viral replication.,"Mutations in the core protein (HBc) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are associated with aggressive hepatitis and advanced liver diseases in chronic hepatitis B (CHB). In this study, we identified the L60V variation in HBc that generates a new HLA-A2-restricted CD8(+) T cell epitope by screening an overlapping 9-mer peptide pool covering HBc and its variants. The nonameric epitope V60 was determined by structural and immunogenic analysis. The HBc L60V variation is correlated with hepatic necroinflammation and higher viral levels, and it may be associated with a poor prognosis in CHB patients. Immunization with the defined HBV epitope V60 peptide elicited specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-induced liver injury in HLA-A2(+) HBV transgenic mice. In addition, in vitro and in vivo experiments both demonstrated that the HBc L60V variation facilitates viral capsid assembly and increases HBV replication. These data suggest that the HBc L60V variation can impact both HBV replication and HBV-specific T cell responses. Therefore, our work provides further dissection of the impact of the HBc L60V variation, which orchestrates HBV replication, viral persistence, and immunopathogenesis during chronic viral infection.

Results showed that, after three doses of vaccine, central memory and effector memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes, as well as HPV-specific interleukin (IL)2(+)/CD4(+), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ(+))/CD4(+), IFN-γ(+)/CD8(+) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)(+)/CD8(+) T lymphocytes and Perforin and Granzyme B secreting CD8(+) T lymphocytes were significantly increased.

Doc No.533,6693,negative/unlabeled,9.116047,HIV replication leads to skewed maturation of CD8-positive T-cell responses in infected children.,"HIV-1 infection causes a severe T-cell impairment with alteration of immune response. However, in children the natural decline of lymphocytes and CD4 cells in early life makes it more difficult to monitor immunocompetence and progression of HIV-infection. Aim of this study was to characterize the CD8 response in non-vertically HIV-infected children exposed persistently to viremia and in HIV-infected children controlling efficiently viremia by ART, by analysing the effect of persistent viremia on CD4 and CD8 T-cells count, HIV-specific immune-response and naive/memory pattern of CD8 T-cell. Whereas, no differences of CD4 count between viremic patients and viral controllers were observed (1046.9 +/- 472.1 cells/microl vs 1101.3 +/- 415.4 cells/microl; p > 0.05), CD8 count was higher in the viremic patients (1080.6 +/- 652.1 cells/microl vs 747.5 +/- 389.9 cells/microl, p < 0.05). In viremic patients, HIV-specific CD8 T-cells correlated with viral load. However, in this group a loss of HIV-specific CD8 response was associated with a 7 fold decrease of naïve and increase of pre-effector CD8 T-cells (62.8% +/- 10.21% vs 10.37% +/- 7.91%, p < 0.03). Persistent exposure to viremia alters HIV-specific CD8 response possibly through a persistent immune activation process leading to exhaustion of naive CD8 T-cells and skewed maturation of memory subset. Therefore, memory CD8 T-cells might lose the ability to respond correctly and efficiently to HIV-antigen exposure."
Doc No.534,767,negative/unlabeled,9.115748,CD4+ T-cell help is required for effective CD8+ T cell-mediated resolution of acute viral hepatitis in mice.,"Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are essential for the control of viral liver infections, such as those caused by HBV or HCV. It is not entirely clear whether CD4+ T-cell help is necessary for establishing anti-viral CD8+ T cell responses that successfully control liver infection. To address the role of CD4+ T cells in acute viral hepatitis, we infected mice with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) of the strain WE; LCMV-WE causes acute hepatitis in mice and is cleared from the liver by CD8+ T cells within about two weeks. The role of CD4+ T-cell help was studied in CD4+ T cell-lymphopenic mice, which were either induced by genetic deficiency of the major histocompatibility (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA) in CIITA-/- mice, or by antibody-mediated CD4+ cell depletion. We found that CD4+ T cell-lymphopenic mice developed protracted viral liver infection, which seemed to be a consequence of reduced virus-specific CD8+ T-cell numbers in the liver. Moreover, the anti-viral effector functions of the liver-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in response to stimulation with LCMV peptide, notably the IFN-γ production and degranulation capacity were impaired in CIITA-/- mice. The impaired CD8+ T-cell function in CIITA-/- mice was not associated with increased expression of the exhaustion marker PD-1. Our findings indicate that CD4+ T-cell help is required to establish an effective antiviral CD8+ T-cell response in the liver during acute viral infection. Insufficient virus control and protracted viral hepatitis may be consequences of impaired initial CD4+ T-cell help. "

We systematically reviewed the treatment of chronic HCV infection in those infected with HIV. We propose that with the advent of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, patients coinfected with HCV and HIV have similar SVR rates as HCV-monoinfected persons and that DAAs address an unmet medical need in this population. A review was performed using Medical Subject Heading terms within the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases to search for studies dated between January 2004 and July 2017. Keywords used in the study included ""hepatitis C,"" ""HIV,"" ""coinfection,"" and ""direct-acting antiviral."" SVR rates for those with HCV and HIV coinfection treated with interferon-based therapies were substantially lower that SVR rates of HCV-monoinfected individuals. The advent of DAA agents has resulted in similar SVR rates between monoinfected and coinfected individuals, with SVR >93%. These medications have been demonstrated to have improved safety, efficacy, and tolerability in comparison to interferon-based regimens."
Doc No.536,9442,negative/unlabeled,9.104043,Human anti-HIV-1 tat sFv intrabodies for gene therapy of advanced HIV-1-infection and AIDS.,"The early successes of highly active anti-retroviral therapies (HAART) for the treatment of HIV-1-infection and AIDS have raised the question as to whether there is a legitimate role for gene therapy in the treatment of this chronic infectious disease. However, in many patients the profound suppression of viral replication is short lived, particularly if patients have been treated with sequential monotherapies in the past, have been infected with a highly drug resistant isolate of HIV-1, or have temporarily discontinued therapy as a ""holiday"" or because of drug intolerance. In addition, life-long adherence to maintenance HAART will probably be required even in responding patients with undetectable viremia because of the reservoirs of latently infected cells that can persist for years. Gene therapy through the introduction of anti-retroviral ""resistance"" genes into CD4(+) T cells is one approach that could give long term protection to these HIV-1 susceptible cells in vivo. We have explored this approach by developing intrabodies to the critical HIV-1 transactivator protein, Tat that is absolutely required for HIV-1 replication. This provocative treatment approach, that will be tested in a clinical gene therapy trial, sets the groundwork for determining if anti-Tat intrabody gene therapy together with HAART can provide a treatment strategy for the immune reconstitution of HIV-1-infected patients with advanced disease."

Adherence to therapy was estimated from a score calculated from answers to a self-administered questionnaire and on the basis of measurement of relevant plasma and blood levels. Of the 149 patients, 112 had a virologic response, and 122 had adequate trough PI levels. Plasma PI levels and virologic outcome were significantly correlated (P<.0001). The adherence score was significantly correlated with virologic response (P<.001). Macrocytosis was significantly associated with virologic response in the patients treated with zidovudine or stavudine (P=.006). PI level was the higher significant predictor of virologic response (P=.0003). Self-reported adherence (P=.01) and macrocytosis (P=.05) were also independently associated with antiretroviral efficacy."

However, 9 Chinese subjects in Taiwan with histories of multiple sexual exposures to HIV remained uninfected, suggesting that certain anti-HIV factors do indeed exist. Experiments were therefore designed to investigate the immune mechanism that protects this cohort against HIV infection. Peripheral blood samples from these 9 subjects and 7 healthy people who had not been exposed to HIV were obtained for the quantitation of the levels for beta-chemokines and interleukin 16 (IL-16) in serum samples or secreted by peripheral blood lymphocytes. Significantly higher serum levels for nearly all 3 beta-chemokines, regulation on activation, normal T cell-expressed and secreted, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, and MIP-1beta (P<.05, P<.05, and P=.05, respectively), but not IL-16, were detected in the 9 HIV-uninfected subjects as compared with control subjects. The result suggests that among the host genes and cellular factors thus far identified, beta-chemokines are the major HIV-suppressive factors that protect Chinese people from infection with HIV."

A protein associated with this activity was purified from the culture supernatant of an immortalized CD8(+) T cell clone and identified as the beta-chemokine macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC). MDC suppressed infection of CD8(+) cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells by primary non-syncytium-inducing and syncytium-inducing isolates of HIV-1 and the T cell line-adapted isolate HIV-1IIIB. MDC was expressed in activated, but not resting, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and binds a receptor on activated primary T cells. These observations indicate that beta-chemokines are responsible for a major proportion of HIV-1-specific suppressor activity produced by primary T cells."
Doc No.540,3637,negative/unlabeled,9.102031,Dual protease inhibitor therapy in HIV-infected patients: pharmacologic rationale and clinical benefits.,"HIV protease inhibitors, as components of combination antiretroviral drug regimens, have substantially reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection. They selectively block the action of the virus-encoded protease and stop the virus from replicating. In general, these drugs have poor systemic bioavailability and must be dosed with respect to meals for optimal absorption. Protease inhibitor-containing regimens require ingestion of a large number of capsules, are costly, and produce or are susceptible to metabolic drug interactions. Simultaneous administration of two protease inhibitors takes advantage of beneficial pharmacokinetic interactions and may circumvent many of the drugs' undesirable pharmacologic properties. For example, ritonavir increases saquinavir concentrations at steady state by up to 30-fold, allowing reduction of saquinavir dose and dosing frequency. Ritonavir decreases the systemic clearance of indinavir and overcomes the deleterious effect of food on indinavir bioavailability. These benefits reflect inhibition of presystemic clearance and first-pass metabolism, as well as inhibition of systemic clearance mediated by hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4. Several dual protease inhibitor combination regimens have shown great promise in clinical trials and are now recommended as components of salvage therapy for HIV-infected patients."

As an approach to this question we used herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) to transform CD8+ T lymphocytes from an HIV+ asymptomatic donor to a continuously growing, activation-independent, IL-2-dependent phenotype. The transformed cell population, termed CD8(HVS), had an activated phenotype, contained HVS sequences, did not shed infectious HVS virus, and was polyclonal. The CD8(HVS) cells, despite the absence of detectable CTL activity, potently suppressed HIV-1 production by both autologous and heterologous CD4+ cells from infected donors. The CD8(HVS) cells in coculture also suppressed virus production from PBMCs acutely infected with syncytium-inducing (SI) strains or NSI primary isolates of HIV-1. The supernatants from the CD8(HVS) cells and their concentrates derived from these supernatants were suppressive to NSI primary isolates of HIV-1 but not to SI strains. Fractionation of these concentrates showed that the suppressive activity was associated with low molecular mass (6500- to 19,300-Da) protein species. Western blotting and ELISA indicated that the CC chemokines MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES were present in these fractions. Antibody-blocking studies with antibodies to the CC chemokines indicated that a significant portion of the soluble HIV-suppressive activity was due to these molecules. However, these experiments also suggested the inhibitory activity of the CD8(HVS) cells in coculture is not due exclusively to the CC chemokines. The HVS-transformed cells provide a useful tool for the study of noncytolytic CD8+ T lymphocyte-mediated suppression of HIV-1."

Not only CD4+ cell line but also CD8+ cell line could be infected with HIV and CD4+ cell line showed a higher susceptibility than CD8+ cell line on HIV infection. HIV antigen in early stage after HIV inoculation was detected by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) rather than indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). HTLV-I producing CD4+ and CD8+ cell lines became to express two viral antigens (HTLV-I and HIV) after HIV inoculation. The results indicated that CD4-CD8+ T-cell line from patient with HAM can be infected with HIV. So that, we have found that other epitopes except for CD4 antigen may be associated with HIV infection."

Here we investigated the possibility that Bacitracin and or DTNB might have other antiviral activities besides FI. By means of residual activity assays, we found that both compounds showed antiviral activity only to viruses T-tropic HIV-1 strain. Cell-based fusion assays showed inhibition on HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-gal (CD4) and HL2/3 cells treated with Bacitracin, and DTNB with the latest compound we observed fusion inhibition on both cells but strikingly in HL2/3 cells (expressing Env) indicating a possible activity on both, the cell membrane and the viral envelope. A time-of-addition experiment showed that both compounds act on HIV entry inhibition but DTNB also acts at late stages of the viral cycle. Lastly, we also found evidence of long-lasting host cell protection in vitro by DTNB, an important pharmacodynamic parameter for a topical microbicide against virus infection, hours after the extracellular drug was removed; this protection was not rendered by Bacitracin. These drugs proved to be leading compounds for further studies against HIV showing antiviral characteristics of interest."

This study examines the prevalence and patterns of resistance-associated mutations to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors (RTI, PRI) in 278 HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve subjects from countries of Eastern Europe, and defines characteristic polymorphisms of RT and PR sequences in HIV-1 subtype A viruses. Blood samples were collected between 1997 and 2004. Plasma RNA was used for PR-RT amplification by reverse transcription coupled with nested PCR and sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis was done with neighbor-joining trees and bootscanning. Analysis of drug resistance mutations, with Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database's algorithm, resulted in an overall prevalence of 12.9% resistance to RTI and 3.9% to PRI. The most frequent substitutions in the RT region were at positions 62 and 236. V77I substitution in PR was found in 47.8% of samples. Polymorphisms in subtype A sequences were identified. This is the first study reporting the prevalence and patterns of both PRI and RTI resistance-associated mutations in naïve HIV-1 infected patients from the former Soviet Union. These data underline the importance of genotypic resistance testing of chronically HIV-1-infected patients before initiating treatment, in order to select the most suitable drug regimen."

Despite the lack of overt clinical disease, the asymptomatic phase is characterized by persistent immunologic impairment. In the peripheral blood obtained from cats experimentally infected with FIV-C for approximately 5 years, we identified a persistent inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio. We cloned and sequenced the FIV-C long terminal repeat containing the viral promoter from cells infected with the inoculating virus and from in vivo-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4 T cells isolated at multiple time points throughout the asymptomatic phase. Relative to the inoculating virus, viral sequences amplified from cells isolated from all of the infected animals demonstrated multiple single nucleotide mutations and a short deletion within the viral U3, R and U5 regions. A transcriptionally inactivating proviral mutation in the U3 promoter AP-1 site was identified at multiple time points from all of the infected animals but not within cell-associated viral RNA. In contrast, no mutations were identified within the sequence of the viral dUTPase gene amplified from PBMC isolated at approximately 5 years post-infection relative to the inoculating sequence. The possible implications of these mutations to viral pathogenesis are discussed. "
Doc No.546,6024,negative/unlabeled,9.066524,HLA footprints on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 are associated with interclade polymorphisms and intraclade phylogenetic clustering.,"The selection of escape mutations has a major impact on immune control of infections with viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Viral evasion of CD8(+) T-cell responses leaves predictable combinations of escape mutations, termed HLA ""footprints."" The most clearly defined footprints are those associated with HLA alleles that are linked with successful control of HIV, such as HLA-B*57. Here we investigated the extent to which HLA footprint sites in HIV type 1 (HIV-1) are associated with viral evolution among and within clades. First, we examined the extent to which amino acid differences between HIV-1 clades share identity with sites of HLA-mediated selection pressure and observed a strong association, in particular with respect to sites of HLA-B selection (P < 10(-6)). Similarly, the sites of amino acid variability within a clade were found to overlap with sites of HLA-selected mutation. Second, we studied the impact of HLA selection on interclade phylogeny. Removing the sites of amino acid variability did not significantly affect clade-specific clustering, reflecting the central role of founder effects in establishing distinct clades. However, HLA footprints may underpin founder strains, and we show that amino acid substitutions between clades alter phylogeny, underlining a potentially substantial role for HLA in driving ongoing viral evolution. Finally, we investigated the impact of HLA selection on within-clade phylogeny and demonstrate that even a single HLA allele footprint can result in significant phylogenetic clustering of sequences. In conclusion, these data highlight the fact that HLA can be a strong selection force for both intra- and interclade HIV evolution at a population level."

In order to better define the mechanisms of the HLA-B 2705 immune control of HIV, we first characterized the CD8(+) T-cell responses of nine highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-naïve B 2705-positive subjects. Unexpectedly, we observed a strong response to an HLA-B 2705-restricted Pol epitope, KRKGGIGGY (KY9), in 8/9 subjects. The magnitude of the KY9 response was only marginally lower than that of the KK10-specific response (median, 695 versus 867 spot-forming cells [SFC]/million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]; not significant [NS]), and viral escape mutants were observed in both KY9 and KK10, resulting from selection pressure driven by the respective CD8(+) T-cell response. By comparing inhibitions of viral replication by CD8(+) T cells specific for the Gag KK10, Pol KY9, and Vpr VL9 HLA-B 2705-restricted epitopes, we observed a consistent hierarchy of antiviral efficacy (Gag KK10 > Pol KY9 > Vpr VL9). This hierarchy was associated with early recognition of HIV-1-infected cells, within 6 h of infection, by KK10- and KY9-specific CD8(+) T cells but not until 18 h postinfection by VL9-specific CD8(+) T cells. There was no association between antiviral efficacy and proliferative capacity, cytotoxicity, polyfunctionality, or T-cell receptor (TCR) avidity. These data are consistent with previous studies indicating an important role for the B 2705-Gag KK10 response in the control of HIV but also suggest a previously unrecognized role played by the subdominant Pol-specific KY9 response in HLA-B 2705-mediated control of HIV and that the recognition of HIV-infected cells by CD8(+) T cells early in the viral life cycle may be important for viral containment in HIV-infected individuals."

Data were obtained by anonymous, self-reporting questionnaire from 645 nurses, physicians and ancillary staff in 2007. Around two-thirds of workers (67.9%) had suffered at least 1 NSI in the last 12 months. High-risk patients (with history of HIV, hepatitis B virus or, hepatitis C virus infection or injecting drug use) were involved in 8.2% of injuries. On evaluating the effectiveness of existing control measures, significant protective factors against NSI were: using devices with safety features (OR 0.41), adherence to infection control guidelines (OR 0.42), training in injection safety (OR 0.14), comfortable room temperature (OR 0.32) and availability of a written protocol for prompt reporting (OR 0.37)."

This study characterized substance use patterns between HIV/HCV co-infected and HIV mono-infected Russian women. HIV-infected women (N = 247; M age = 30.0) in St. Petersburg, Russia, completed a survey assessing substance use, problematic substance use, and the co-occurrence of substance use and sexual behaviors. Covariate adjusted logistic and linear regression analyses indicated that HIV/HCV co-infected participants (57.1 %) reported more lifetime drug use (e.g., heroin: AOR: 13.2, 95 % CI 4.9, 35.3, p < .001), problem drinking (β = 1.2, p = .05), substance use problems (β = 1.3, p = .009), and increased likelihood of past injection drug use (AOR: 26.4, 95 % CI 8.5, 81.9, p < .001) relative to HIV mono-infected individuals. HIV/HCV co-infection was prevalent and associated with increased substance use and problematic drug use. Findings highlight the need for ongoing substance use and HIV/HCV risk behavior assessment and treatment among HIV/HCV co-infected Russian women."
Doc No.550,1051,negative/unlabeled,9.057679,Improved survival in HIV-infected persons: consequences and perspectives.,"A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient in 2007 has the option to commence an antiretroviral regimen that is extremely efficacious in suppressing the virus and has few side effects. In a recent study, we estimated the median remaining lifetime of a newly diagnosed 25-year-old HIV-infected individual to be 39 years. The prospect of a near-normal life expectancy has implications for the HIV-infected persons as well as for the handling of the disease in the healthcare system. The patients can now on a long-term perspective plan their professional career, join a pension plan and start a family. Further, they may expect to be treated equally with other members of society with respect to access to mortgage, health insurance and life insurance. As the infected population ages, more patients will contract age-related diseases, and the disease burden on some individuals may even come to be dominated by non-HIV-related conditions that may have a worse prognosis and therefore become more important than HIV-related conditions. Despite the improvements in antiretroviral therapy, there is still an excess mortality among HIV patients, which appears to be only partially attributable to immunodeficiency, with lifestyle factors potentially playing a pronounced role. Consequently, an effort to further increase survival must target risk factors for both HIV-related and -unrelated mortality. The continuation of the positive trend may be achieved by increased HIV testing, earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy, improved drug adherence, prevention and treatment of HIV-unrelated co-morbidity and collaboration with other medical specialists to treat an ageing co-morbidity-acquiring HIV population."
Doc No.551,9484,negative/unlabeled,9.055224,Engagement of the CD4 receptor affects the redistribution of Lck to the immunological synapse in primary T cells: implications for T-cell activation during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulated immune responses in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is crucial for the control of HIV/AIDS. Despite the postulate that HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120-CD4 interactions lead to impaired T-cell responses, the precise mechanisms underlying such association are not clear. To address this, we analyzed Lck and F-actin redistribution into the immunological synapse in stimulated human primary CD4(+) T cells from HIV-1-infected donors. Similar experiments were performed with CD4(+) T cells from HIV-uninfected donors, which were exposed to anti-CD4 domain 1 antibodies, as an in vitro model of gp120-CD4 interactions, or aldithriol-inactivated HIV-1 virions before stimulation. CD4(+) T cells from HIV-infected patients exhibited a two- to threefold inhibition of both Lck and F-actin recruitment into the synapse, compared to cells from uninfected donors. Interestingly, defective recruitment of Lck was ameliorated following suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy. Engagement of the CD4 receptor on T cells from HIV-uninfected donors before anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation led to similar defects. Furthermore, the redistribution of Lck into lipid rafts was abrogated by CD4 preengagement. Our results suggest that the engagement of CD4 by HIV gp120 prior to T-cell receptor stimulation leads to dysregulation of early signaling events and could consequently play an important role in impaired CD4(+) T-cell function."
Doc No.552,8337,negative/unlabeled,9.053323,Naturally occurring accessory gene mutations lead to persistent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection of CD4-positive T cells.,"Proviral DNA from cells surviving severe but transient cytopathic effects, mediated by infection with recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) carrying a single gene mutation at vif, vpr, or vpu, was characterized by use of HIV-1-specific primer pairs in a two-step PCR. Deletion mutations were detected in a region that spanned the vif and vpr open reading frames. Cloning and sequencing of the amplified DNA from this region revealed frequent large deletions in a limited number of nucleotide positions. Analyses of the deletions suggested that (i) genetic recombination, (ii) template-primer slippage, and (iii) misalignment of the growing point during reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genome might be the mechanisms that generated the mutations. Apart from the large deletions, smaller deletions that gave frameshift mutations in vif and/or vpr prevailed. In addition, cells infected with a triple mutant defective in vif, vpr, and vpu did not show any cytopathic effect. Thus, mutations generating multiple accessory gene defects during HIV-1 replication correlate with viral persistence and loss of cytopathogenicity."

We start from a basic model of virus infection and then review a number of more advanced models with consideration of pharmacokinetic factors, adherence and drug resistance. Specifically, we illustrate how mathematical models can be developed and parameterized to understand the effects of long-term treatment and different treatment strategies on disease progression. In addition, we discuss a variety of parameter estimation methods for differential equation models that are applicable to either within- or between-host viral dynamics. "
Doc No.554,1490,negative/unlabeled,9.04764,Patterns of cytokine production in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific human CD8+ T cells after stimulation with HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells.,"Although human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CD8+ T cells can produce various cytokines that suppress HIV-1 replication or modulate anti-HIV-1 immunity, the extent to which HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells produce cytokines when they recognize HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells in vivo still remains unclear. We first analyzed the abilities of 10 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones specific for three HIV-1 epitopes to produce gamma interferon, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha after stimulation with epitope peptide-pulsed cells. These CTL clones produced these cytokines in various combinations within the same specificity and among the different specificities, suggesting a functional heterogeneity of HIV-1-specific effector CD8+ T cells in cytokine production. In contrast, the HIV-1-specific CTL clones for the most part produced a single cytokine, without heterogeneity of cytokine production among the clones, after stimulation with HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. The loss of heterogeneity in cytokine production may be explained by low surface expression of HLA class I-epitope peptide complexes. Freshly isolated HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells with an effector/memory or memory phenotype produced much more of the cytokines than the same epitope-specific CTL clones when stimulated with HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. Cytokine production from HIV-1-specific memory/effector and memory CD8+ T cells might be a critical event in the eradication of HIV-1 in HIV-1-infected individuals."

We developed a population pharmacokinetic model for tenofovir and investigated the impacts of different dose reporting methods. Dosing information was collected as patient-reported dosing information (PRDI) from 404 subjects (corresponding to 1,280 drug concentration records) from the main trial and electronic monitoring-based adherence data collected from 211 subjects (corresponding to 327 drug concentration records) in an ancillary adherence study. Model development was conducted with NONMEM (7.2), using PRDI with a steady-state assumption or using PRDI replaced with electronic monitoring records where available. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption was the best model in both modeling approaches, with the need for an absorption lag time when electronic monitoring-based dosing records were included in the analysis. Age, body weight, and creatinine clearance were significant covariates on clearance, but only creatinine clearance was retained in the final models per stepwise selection. Sex was not a significant covariate on clearance. Tenofovir population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates and the precisions of the parameters from the two final models were comparable with the point estimates of the parameters, differing from 0% to 35%, and bootstrap confidence intervals widely overlapped. These findings indicate that PRDI was sufficient for population pharmacokinetic model development in this study, with a high level of adherence per multiple measures."
Doc No.556,946,negative/unlabeled,9.037767,Factors predicting occurrence and prognosis of hepatitis-B-virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Primary liver cancer is an important cause of cancer death, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 70%-85% of total liver cancer worldwide. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection contributes to > 75% of HCC cases. High serum viral load is the most reliable indicator of viral replication in predicting development of HCC. HBV genotype C is closely associated with HCC in cirrhotic patients aged > 50 years, whereas genotype B is associated with development of HCC in non-cirrhotic young patients and postoperative relapse of HCC. Different HBV subgenotypes have distinct patterns of mutations, which are clearly associated with increased risk of HCC. Mutations accumulate during chronic HBV infection and predict occurrence of HCC. Chronic inflammation leads to increased frequency of viral mutation via cellular cytidine deaminase induction. Mutations are negatively selected by host immunity, whereas some immuno-escaped HBV mutants are active in hepatocarcinogenesis. Inflammatory pathways contribute to the inflammation-necrosis-regeneration process, ultimately HCC. Their hallmark molecules can predict malignancy in HBV-infected subjects. Continuing inflammation is involved in hepatocarcinogenesis and closely related to recurrence and metastasis. HBV load, genotype C, viral mutations and expression of inflammatory molecules in HBV-related HCC tissues are significantly associated with poor prognosis. Imbalance between intratumoral CD8(+) T cells and regulatory T cells or Th1 and Th2 cytokines in peritumoral tissues can predict prognosis of HBV-related HCC. These factors are important for developing active prevention and surveillance of HBV-infected subjects who are more likely to develop HCC, or for tailoring suitable treatment to improve survival or postpone postoperative recurrence of HCC."
Doc No.557,2320,negative/unlabeled,9.035608,Examining the relationship between psychological distress and adherence to anti-retroviral therapy among Ugandan adolescents living with HIV.,"Psychological distress is common among adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) worldwide, and has been associated with non-adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART), leading to poor virologic suppression, drug resistance, and increased risk for AIDS morbidity and mortality. However, only a few studies have explored the relationship between psychological distress and ART adherence among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper examines the relationship between psychological distress and ART adherence, and effect of psychosocial resources on ART adherence. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 464 ALHIV (aged 12-19; 53% female) seeking HIV care at a large HIV treatment center in Kampala, Uganda. ALHIV were recruited during routine clinic visits. Three self-reported binary adherence measures were utilized: missed pills in the past three days, non-adherence to the prescribed medical regimen, and self-rated adherence assessed using a visual analog scale. Psychological distress was measured as a continuous variable, and computed as the mean score on a locally developed and validated 25-item symptom checklist for Ugandan ALHIV. Psychosocial resources included spirituality, religiosity, optimism, social support, and coping strategies. After adjusting for respondents' socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial resources, a unit increase in psychological distress was associated with increased odds of missing pills in past 3 days (Odds Ratio(OR) = 1.75; Confidence Interval (CI): 1.04-2.95), not following the prescribed regimen (OR = 1.63; CI: 1.08-2.46), and lower self-rated adherence (OR = 1.79; CI: 1.19-2.69). Psychosocial resources were associated with lower odds for non-adherence on all three self-report measures. There is a need to strengthen the psychosocial aspects of adolescent HIV care by developing interventions to identify and prevent psychological distress among Ugandan ALHIV."

Doc No.559,2297,negative/unlabeled,9.0256,Transcriptional activity of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 LTR promoter in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.,"We have analyzed the transcriptional activity of the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) LTR promoter in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S.pombe). The ability of a series of 5'-deleted forms of the HIV-1 LTR promoter to direct transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene was studied. We found that the HIV-1 promoter is functional in S.pombe and that deletion of sequences upstream of the NF-kB binding site previously identified to contain the negative regulatory element (NRE) in mammalian cells, resulted in about thirty-fold increase in transcriptional activity. Sequences in the HIV-1 promoter that bind NF-kB were found to be essential for transcriptional activation in S.pombe. In mammalian cells, transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR requires TAR sequences and the viral Tat protein. In fission yeast, Tat failed to transactivate the HIV-1 LTR, suggesting that S.pombe may lack a cellular factor(s) required for the Tat transactivation process."
Doc No.560,9379,positive/labeled,9.02204,Increased sensitivity of T lymphocytes to tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1)- and TNFR2-mediated apoptosis in HIV infection: relation to expression of Bcl-2 and active caspase-8 and caspase-3.,"The destruction of CD4 T cells in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with activation of apoptotic programs, partly mediated by death receptors. The role of CD95L/CD95 in depletion of patients' CD4 T cells is well documented, but the possible contribution of the tumor necrosis factor/tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF/TNFR) pathway has not been examined. In this study, we found that both TNFR1 and TNFR2 induced marked apoptosis in peripheral T cells from HIV-infected persons, involving both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Longitudinal follow-up of HIV(+) patients suggests an association between the in vivo evolution of CD4 T-cell numbers and variations in susceptibility to TNFR-induced apoptosis. Analysis of molecular mechanisms involved showed that it was not related to altered ex vivo expression of TNFR1-associated death domain, receptor interacting protein, or TNFR-associated factor 2. Susceptibility to TNFR-mediated apoptosis was rather related to Bcl-2 expression, because patients' T cells expressing high levels of Bcl-2 were completely protected from TNFR1- and TNFR2-induced cell death, whereas T cells expressing normal levels of Bcl-2 were not protected in patients in contrast to controls. Early recruitment of caspase-8 and caspase-3 is needed to transduce the apoptotic signals, and expression of both caspases in their active form was detected in blood T cells from HIV(+) patients, whereas it was hardly detected in controls. Moreover, ligation of TNFRs induced increased activation of both caspases in patients' T cells. Together these data demonstrate that exacerbated TNFR-mediated cell death of T cells from HIV-infected individuals is associated with both alteration of Bcl-2 expression and activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 and may contribute to the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."

Investigators of the Quebec Primary Infection Study.,"The widespread use of antiretroviral agents (ARVs) and the growing occurrence of HIV strains resistant to these drugs have given rise to serious concerns regarding the transmission of resistant viruses to newly infected persons. Plasma viral RNA from 80 individuals newly infected between 1997 and 1999 was genotyped by automated sequencing to analyze the profile of viruses resistant to nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs) and to protease inhibitors (PIs). The prevalence of mutations that conferred primary resistance to PIs (L10I, D30Y, V82A, L90M) was 15% of the cohort. RT genotypic variants, associated with high-level resistance to ARVs, were observed in 21% of individuals, including NRTI, NNRTI and multidrug (MDR) resistance in 6, 5, and 10% of cases, respectively. The phenotypic susceptibility of viral isolates to ARVs was also assayed and showed transmission of high-level resistance to ZDV, 3TC, and PIs in those individuals with MDR. The transmission of drug-resistant HIV genotypic variants is a serious problem that merits further attention by public health officials, virologists, and clinicians."

We report that differential expression of a novel secreted factor, ps20, previously implicated in tissue remodeling, may underlie why some CD4 T cells are preferentially targeted. We show that (i) there is a significant positive correlation between endogenous ps20 mRNA in diverse CD4 T-cell populations and in vitro infection, (ii) a ps20(+) permissive cell can be made less permissive by antibody blockade- or small-interference RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous ps20, and (iii) conversely, a ps20(low) cell can be more permissive by adding ps20 exogenously or engineering stable ps20 expression by retroviral transduction. ps20 expression is normally detectable in CD4 T cells after in vitro activation and interleukin-2 expansion, and such oligoclonal populations comprise ps20(positive) and ps20(low/negative) isogenic clones at an early differentiation stage (CD45RO(+)/CD25(+)/CD28(+)/CD57(-)). This pattern is altered in chronic HIV infection, where ex vivo CD4(+) CD45RO(+) T cells express elevated ps20. ps20 promoted HIV entry via fusion and augmented CD54 integrin expression; both of these effects were reversed by anti-ps20 antibody. We therefore propose ps20 to be a novel signature of HIV-permissive CD4 T cells that promotes infection in an autocrine and paracrine manner and that HIV has coopted a fundamental role of ps20 in promoting cell adhesion for its benefit. Disrupting the ps20 pathway may therefore provide a novel anti-HIV strategy."

The intervention included a video, posters, pens, mugs, and lapel buttons with the campaign slogan ""Live the Solution: Take Your Pills Every Day."" Participants self-reported adherence over a 4-week interval, the primary outcome, with a visual analogue scale. Pre- and post-intervention surveys were completed by 141 participants. Adherence did not change over time (absolute mean change -2.02 %, paired t test P = 0.39). Among the 39.7 % of participants who correctly identified the campaign slogan on the post-intervention survey, adherence increased by 3.3 %, while it decreased in the other participants by 5.5 % (paired t test P = 0.07). The well-received campaign did not increase short-term adherence to ART, but adherence tended to increase in participants who were more engaged with the intervention. Future interventions should engage patients more completely and have a more potent effect on adherence."

Clinical-grade DCs were infected with good manufacturing practice-grade ALVAC-HIV vaccine constructs. ALVAC infection, HIV gene expression, and DC viability and function were monitored by use of immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, blastogenesis assays, antigen-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay protein detection. The vaccines infected both immature and mature DCs, and intracellular HIV-1 Gag protein was detected within hours. ALVAC-HIV induced DC maturation that was mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and induced DC apoptosis that was directly related to the length of vaccine exposure. Of importance, the infected DCs remained functional in T cell stimulation assays and induced HIV antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell production of IFN-gamma from cells of HIV-1-infected individuals. These data support an ongoing HIV vaccine trial comparing conventional vaccine delivery routes with ex vivo vaccine-loaded autologous DCs for immunogenicity in HIV-1-uninfected volunteers."

To address these issues, we developed a recombinant vaccinia virus DIs vaccine (rDIsSIVGag), which is nonreplicative in mammalian cells and expresses the full-length gag gene of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Intravenous inoculation of 10(6) PFU of rDIsSIVGag in cynomologus macaques induced significant levels of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) spot-forming cells (SFC) specific for SIV Gag. Antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferative responses were also induced and were temporally associated with the peak of IFN-gamma SFC activity in each macaque. In contrast, macaques immunized with a vector control (rDIsLacZ) showed no significant induction of antigen-specific immune responses. After challenge with a highly pathogenic simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), CD4(+) T lymphocytes were maintained in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues of the immunized macaques. The viral set point in plasma was also reduced in these animals, which may be related to the enhancement of virus-specific intracellular IFN-gamma(+) CD8(+) cell numbers and increased antibody titers after SHIV challenge. These results demonstrate that recombinant DIs has potential for use as an HIV/AIDS vaccine."

Little is known about the functional capacity of these lymphocytes, which could provide insights into mechanisms of failure of viral control and liver damage in this setting. We compared the effector function of total circulating and intrahepatic CD8 T cells in CHB patients and healthy donors. We demonstrated that CD8 T cells from CHB patients, regardless of their antigen specificity, were impaired in their ability to produce interleukin-2 and proliferate upon TCR-dependent stimulation. In contrast, these CD8 T cells had preserved production of the proinflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This aberrant functional profile was partially attributable to down-regulation of the proximal T cell receptor signaling molecule CD3zeta, and could be corrected in vitro by transfection of CD3zeta or replenishment of the amino acid arginine required for its expression. We provide evidence for depletion of arginine in the inflamed hepatic microenvironment as a potential mechanism for these defects in global CD8 T cell signaling and function. These data imply that polarized CD8 T cells within the HBV-infected liver may impede proliferative antiviral effector function, while contributing to the proinflammatory cytokine environment."

The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B in a group of IDU cadavers and to compare the results to a group of cadavers of the normal population. In a case-control study the blood samples of the cadavers of 400 randomly chosen IDUS and 400 other cadavers as control group were checked for HBS antigen and Anti HIV antibody in the forensic medicine center of Tehran. The prevalence of HIV and HBV infection was compared in two groups according to their demographic characteristics. The number of HIV and HBV positive cadavers was significantly higher in the IDU group than the controls (6.25% vs 0.5%, P<0.001, 27.5% vs 3%, P<0.001). The risk of getting infected by HIV virus was 13.27 times greater in the IDU group and the risk of HBV infection was 12.26 times greater in this group as compared to the control group. The age distribution of IDU cadavers indicated that the percentage of IDU cadavers in the reproductive (21-40 years old) age was 80%. The greater prevalence of the HIV and HBV infection especially in the reproductive age of IDUS indicates a greater concern to the authorities for more attention to prevention and harm reduction programs."

Additionally, it aimed to evaluate the correlation among densities of these cells with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and viral load levels in HIV+ subjects, all using Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). The samples were allocated into four groups: 1) 15 subjects with moderate chronic periodontitis (MCP), HIV+; 2) 15 subjects with MCP, HIV-; 3) 10 subjects with gingivitis (G), HIV+; and 4) 10 subjects with G, HIV-. The S100+ cells were assessed in the pocket epithelium, gingival epithelium, and lamina propria. A statistically significant increase of total S100+ cells in HIV+ periodontitis subjects was observed in relation to HIV- periodontitis subjects. No increase of S100+ cells with increased inflammation was observed. No statistically significant correlation among S100+ cells and blood levels of CD4, CD8, and viral load was observed. In conclusion, the use of HAART can aid in achieving viral loads, and it is suggested that it may prevent the destruction of the LC."
Doc No.569,4266,positive/labeled,8.996625,Regeneration and tolerance factor: a correlate of human immunodeficiency virus-associated T-cell activation.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection causes extensive phenotypic alterations in lymphocytes. Cellular markers that are normally absent or expressed at low levels on quiescent cells are upregulated throughout the disease course. The transmembrane form of regeneration and tolerance factor (RTF) is expressed at negligible levels on resting T cells but is quickly upregulated following in vitro stimulation and activation. Recently, we reported that expression of RTF was significantly higher in cells from HIV-seropositive (HIV(+)) individuals than in cells from HIV-seronegative (HIV(-)) individuals. Because T cells from HIV(+) individuals express markers reflecting chronic activation, we hypothesized that these in vivo-activated cells would coexpress RTF. Flow cytometry was used to assess RTF expression on activated (CD38(+) and HLA-DR(+)) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. HIV(+) individuals had higher percentages of RTF(+) CD38(+) (P < 0.0001) or RTF(+) HLA-DR(+) (P = 0.0001) CD4(+) T cells than HIV(-) individuals. In HIV(+) individuals, increased percentages of CD4(+) T cells that were RTF(+), RTF(+) CD38(+), and RTF(+) HLA-DR(+) correlated inversely with the absolute number and percentage of CD4(+) T cells and correlated positively with plasma beta(2)-microglobulin concentrations. HIV(+) individuals had higher percentages of CD8(+) T cells that were RTF(+) CD38(+) (P = 0.0001) or RTF(+) HLA-DR(+) (P = 0.0010). In HIV(+) individuals, increased percentages of CD8(+) T cells that were RTF(+) HLA-DR(+) correlated inversely with the percentage of CD4(+) T cells, and high percentages of CD8(+) T cells that were RTF(+) CD38(+) correlated positively with plasma beta(2)-microglobulin levels. These findings strongly suggest that increased RTF expression is a correlate of HIV-associated immune system activation."

In the present study, we used lymphocytes and hepatocytes isolated from patients with chronic HBV infection to investigate in vitro the effects of FK506 with and without methylprednisolone (25 ng/mL) on mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell activation marker expression, and HBV replication in human hepatocytes. Increasing concentrations of FK506 (0.1, 0.5, and 5 ng/mL) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation with a reduction of the stimulation index by 9.2%, 39.0%, and 55.1%, respectively, with no difference between 25 chronic HBV carriers and normal controls. Methylprednisolone alone had no effect but potentiated the inhibitory effect of all three FK506 concentrations, such that the stimulation index was decreased by 20%, 56.2%, and 65.7%, respectively. FK506 (0.5 ng/ mL) reduced both the percentage of interleukin-2 receptor expressing T cells and the cell surface density of this receptor by 7.1% and 8.7% (P < .01), whereas it only reduced the proportion of HLA-DR expressing T cells by 6.8%. FK506 did not change significantly the intracellular HBV DNA or the hepatic expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in short-term culture of human hepatocytes, whereas methylprednisolone increased the percentage of HBsAg-positive hepatocytes in all 5 patients with active viral replication. These results indicate that the effects of FK506 on T-cell activation in chronic HBV carriers are identical to normal subjects, resulting in marked suppression of T-lymphocyte function but only modest reduction in the expression of cell surface activation markers. The drug showed no direct stimulatory effect on viral replication, suggesting that FK506 can be a useful, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent for liver graft recipients with chronic HBV infection."
Doc No.571,977,negative/unlabeled,8.994717,Development and validation of the WebAd-Q Questionnaire to monitor adherence to HIV therapy.,"OBJECTIVE To present the development and validation of the WebAd-Q Questionnaire, a self-report instrument to monitor adherence to antiretroviral therapy in HIV/AIDS centers in Brazil. METHODS The WebAd-Q is an electronic questionnaire that has three questions about the use of antiretrovirals in the last week. It was constructed from interviews and focus groups with 38 patients. Its validity was tested in a study with a sample of 90 adult patients on antiretroviral therapy for at least three months. We used electronic monitoring bottles, pill counting, and self-report interview to compare adherence. The WebAd-Q was answered on the sixtieth day, twice, with at least one hour of interval. The viral load of the patients was obtained from the service records. We have analyzed the agreement between the answers to the WebAd-Q, the associations, and the correlations with viral load and performance compared to other measures of adherence. RESULTS Among the invited patients, 74 (82.2%) answered the WebAd-Q. No difficulties were reported to answer the questionnaire. The average answer time was 5 min 47 sec. The set of three questions of the WebAd-Q obtained agreement of 89.8%, with Kappa of 0.77 (95%CI 0.61-0.94). The non-adherence answers of the WebAd-Q were associated with detectable viral load. We obtained moderate viral load correlations with the non-adherence scale according to the WebAd-Q. For the three questions of the WebAd-Q, patients with non-adherence answers were also reported as less adherent according to the other measures of adherence. CONCLUSIONS The WebAd-Q answered all the issues considered relevant in the validation of questionnaires, was well understood by patients, was associated with viral load, and obtained good agreement and good performance compared to the other measures. The feasibility analysis of its implementation still depends on a national study on its applicability."
Doc No.572,1332,negative/unlabeled,8.993579,Involvement of long terminal repeat U3 sequences overlapping the transcription control region in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 mRNA 3' end formation.,"In retroviral proviruses, the poly(A) site is present in both long terminal repeats (LTRs) but used only in the 3' position. One mechanism to account for this selective poly(A) site usage is that LTR U3 sequences, transcribed only from the 3' poly(A) site, are required in the RNA for efficient processing. To test this possibility, mutations were made in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) U3 region and the mutated LTRs were inserted into simple and complex transcription units. HIV-1 poly(A) site usage was then quantitated by S1 nuclease analysis following transfection of each construct into human 293 cells. The results showed that U3 sequences confined to the transcription control region were required for efficient usage of the HIV-1 poly(A) site, even when it was placed 1.5 kb from the promoter. Although the roles of U3 in processing and transcription activation were separable, optimal 3' end formation was partly dependent on HIV-1 enhancer and SP1 binding site sequences."

FIV is divided into five phylogenetic subtypes (A, B, C, D, and E), based on genetic diversity. Knowledge of the geographical distribution of subtypes is relevant for understanding different disease progressions and for vaccine development. In this study, viral sequences of 26 infected cats from Rio de Janeiro, 8 undergoing treatment with zidovudine (AZT) for at least 5 years, were successfully amplified from blood specimens. gag capsid (CA), pol reverse transcriptase (RT), and env gp120 (V3-V4) regions were analyzed to determine subtypes and to evaluate potential mutations related to antiretroviral drug resistance among treated cats. Subtyping based on phylogenetic analysis was performed by the neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods. All of the sequences clustered with subtype B in the three regions, exhibiting low genetic variability. Additionally, we found evidence that the same virus is circulating in animals in close contact. The analysis of FIV RT sequences identified two new putative mutations related to drug resistance located in the RT ""finger"" domain, which has 60% identity to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sequence. Amino acid change K-->R at codons 64 and 69 was found in 25% and 37.5% of the treated animals, respectively. These signatures were comparable to K65R and K70R thymidine-associated mutations found in the HIV-1 HXB2 counterpart. This finding strongly suggests a position correlation between the mutations found in FIV and the K65R and K70R substitutions from drug-resistant HIV-1 strains."
Doc No.574,6090,negative/unlabeled,8.990224,Potential use of human stem cell factor as adjunctive therapy for human immunodeficiency virus-related cytopenias.,"Hematopoietic dysfunction with peripheral cytopenias is a common complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Symptomatic anemia is the most common cytopenia and occurs in the presence and absence of myelosuppressive drug therapy such as zidovudine. Drug-induced neutropenia and immune thrombocytopenia are also frequent and occur in up to 50% of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Attempts to reduce the impact of bone marrow failure have focused on dose reduction of zidovudine, ganciclovir, and chemotherapy, and the use of recombinant hematopoietic hormones such as erythropoietin (EPO) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Despite these maneuvers, approximately 30% of patients with AIDS receiving zidovudine will become transfusion-dependent. This has led to investigations of other cytokines that may increase blood cell formation. The recent identification of decreased number and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors in patients with HIV infection suggests that agents which have activity on progenitor cell pools may have clinical utility. We demonstrate that human stem cell factor (HuSCF) increases burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), colony-forming unit-granulocyte-monocyte (CFU-GM), and CFU-Mix formation in vitro in normal and HIV-infected individuals. HuSCF also decreases the sensitivity of BFU-E to inhibition by zidovudine without altering HIV replication in lymphocytes or monocytes, altering peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) or altering the effectiveness of zidovudine or dideoxyinosine in inhibiting HIV replication in lymphocytes or monocytes. These studies suggest that HuSCF may have clinical utility in HIV infection as an adjunctive treatment for HIV-related cytopenias."
Doc No.575,2199,negative/unlabeled,8.981628,Comparison of Detection Rate and Mutational Pattern of Drug-Resistant Mutations Between a Large Cohort of Genotype B and Genotype C Hepatitis B Virus-Infected Patients in North China.,"The study aimed to investigate the association of prevalent genotypes in China (HBV/C and HBV/B) with HBV drug-resistant mutations. A total of 13,847 nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)-treated patients with chronic HBV infection from North China were enrolled. HBV genotypes and resistant mutations were determined by direct sequencing and confirmed by clonal sequencing if necessary. HBV/B, HBV/C, and HBV/D occupied 14.3%, 84.9%, and 0.8% across the study population, respectively. NA usage had no significant difference between HBV/B- and HBV/C-infected patients. Lamivudine-resistant mutations were more frequently detected in HBV/C-infected patients, compared with HBV/B-infected patients (31.67% vs. 25.26%, p < 0.01). Adefovir- and entecavir-resistant mutation detection rates were similar, but the mutational pattern was different between the two genotypes. For adefovir-resistant mutations, HBV/C-infected patients had a higher detection rate of rtA181 V (HBV/C 5.29% vs. HBV/B 1.36%, p < 0.01) and a lower detection rate of rtN236T (2.70% vs. 6.54%, p < 0.01). For entecavir-resistant mutations, HBV/C-infected patients had a higher detection rate of rtM204 V/I+T184 substitution or S202G/C (3.66% vs. 2.16%, p < 0.01) and a lower detection rate of rtM204 V/I+M250 V/I/L substitution (0.67% vs. 1.46%, p < 0.01). Multidrug-resistant mutations (defined as coexistence of mutation to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues) were detected in 104 patients. HBV/C-infected patients had a higher detection rate of multidrug-resistant mutation than HBV/B-infected patients (0.83% vs. 0.35%, p < 0.05). The study for the first time clarified that HBV/C-infected patients had a higher risk to develop multidrug-resistant mutations, compared with HBV/B-infected patients; and HBV/C- and HBV/B-infected patients had different inclinations in the ETV-resistant mutational pattern."

To characterize the potential impact of CAM use on HIV care, we conducted a systematic review of 40 studies of CAM use among HIV-positive people. The goals of this review are to: (1) describe the demographic, biomedical, psychosocial and health behavior correlates of CAM use; (2) characterize patient-reported reasons for CAM use; and (3) identify methodological and conceptual limitations of the reviewed studies. Findings confirm that a high proportion of HIV-positive individuals report CAM use (M=60%). Overall, CAM use is more common among HIV-positive individuals who are men who have sex with men (MSM), non-minority, better educated and less impoverished. The use of CAM is also associated with greater HIV-symptom severity and longer disease duration. HIV-positive CAM users commonly report that they use CAM to prevent or alleviate HIV-related symptoms, reduce treatment side-effects and improve quality of life. Findings regarding the association between CAM use, psychosocial adjustment and adherence to conventional HIV medications are mixed. While the reviewed studies are instrumental in describing the characteristics of HIV-positive CAM users, this literature lacks a conceptual framework to identify causal factors involved in the decision to use CAM or explain implications of CAM use for conventional HIV care. To address this concern, we propose the use of health behavior theory and discuss implications of review findings for HIV care providers."

We have initiated a new approach to recover immune function through the use of novel chemical agents. A cationic amphiphilic drug that binds to Ca(2+)-calmodulin at high concentrations, [10-[3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]-2- (trifluoromethyl)-(10)H-phenothiazine dihydrochloride] [denoted trifluroperazine dihydrochloride (Tfp); molecular weight 480.43] TFP was found at low concentrations (10(-6) to 10(-10) M) to help T cells from AIDS patients to restore proliferation in vitro. Here we show that the Tfp molecule can restore the cell survival of T lymphocytes from PBMCs derived from HIV-1-infected patients in vitro. Tfp enhances T cell proliferation and Th-cell responses by selectively inhibiting cell mortality and apoptosis. The restored antigen-specific response is associated with the synthesis of IL-2 and gamma-interferon. Even though this drug does not possess any detectable antiviral effect, it might be considered as a potential therapeutic agent in HIV-infected patients, to correct immune defects. Besides antiviral compounds, these data may facilitate immune reconstitution in patients with HIV infection and other immunosuppressive diseases."

Studies in South Africa have shown that patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) develop rapidly and transmit drug resistant mutations. Since resistance testing is not widely available in Kwazulu-Natal, the Department of Health conducted the first HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) threshold survey in 2005, which did not identify any mutations associated with HIVDR. The objective of this study was to conduct a follow-up threshold survey to update the information on HIVDR. This study was conducted in 2009 in five antenatal care sites in Kwazulu-Natal using the HIVDR threshold survey method developed by WHO. Two hundred and thirteen newly-diagnosed HIV positive, drug-naïve primigravidae, less than 22 years of age were included in the survey. Of the 82 HIV positive specimens, 17 had insufficient volume for genotyping and, of the remaining 65, 47 were genotyped sequentially. Drug resistance was identified by sequencing the HIV-1 pol gene, using the ViroSeq® HIV-1 genotyping system v2.0. Of the 47 samples that were genotyped, only one presented with a K103N mutation, which equates to a prevalence of transmitted HIVDR of <5%. The low prevalence of transmitted HIVDR is in keeping with statistical models of the early stages of ART rollout. As ART coverage is increasing continuously, there is a need to ensure that vigilance of HIVDR continues so that the emergence and spread of HIVDR is minimized."
Doc No.579,5421,negative/unlabeled,8.971982,Mutant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 genomes with defects in RNA dimerization or encapsidation.,"Retrovirus particles each contain two copies of the viral genome in the form of a noncovalently linked RNA dimer. Earlier studies have mapped a cis-acting region near the 5' end of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome, termed the psi locus, which appears essential for initiation of genomic dimerization, as well as for interactions with the HIV-1 Gag protein that are thought to target the RNA into nascent virions. This HIV-1 psi locus is proposed to be organized in four independent RNA stem-loops; at least three (SL1, SL3, and SL4) contain binding sites for Gag, and one of these (SL1) is implicated in dimer initiation through a kissing-loop mechanism. In this study, we have created HIV-1 proviruses containing psi mutations that affect in vitro Gag binding, RNA dimerization, or both, and we have characterized the effects of these mutations on viral assembly and infectivity by using a single-step infectious assay. We find that various mutations which eliminate the Gag binding sites in SL1 or SL3 produce marked defects in genomic RNA packaging and viral infectivity. In each case, the reduced genomic content of the mutant virions is associated with an increased content of spliced viral transcripts, suggesting that both SL1 and SL3 contribute to the discrimination between spliced and unspliced RNAs. The structures, but not the specific sequences, of the SL1 and SL3 stems appear critical for RNA packaging. Disruption of the stem or deletion of SL1 also results in abnormal genomic dimerization, as assessed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of virion-derived RNA. Virions carrying less extensive mutations in the SL1 loop that are known to prevent in vitro dimerization have impaired infectivity despite normal virion RNA content. This suggests that RNA dimerization is not a prerequisite for genomic packaging but instead serves an independent function in the retroviral infectious cycle."

Doc No.581,8191,negative/unlabeled,8.95876,Association of p65 and C/EBPbeta with HIV-1 LTR modulates transcription of the viral promoter.,"In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) latently infected cells, NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays a critical role in the transcriptional induction of the HIV-1 promoter. The trans-activating ability of NF-kappaB can be modified by another nuclear factor C/EBPbeta that can physically bind to NF-kappaB and regulate its activity. Because the HIV-1 promoter also contains a C/EBPbeta site adjacent to the NF-kappaB site, the present study examined cooperative functional in vivo interaction of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and C/EBPbeta, and the impact of Tat in this event. We demonstrated that ectopic expression of p65 along with Tat increases p65 binding to HIV-1 LTR, and that this increase correlates with enhanced HIV-1 promoter activity. Further, co-expression of C/EBPbeta and Tat leads to a decrease in p65 binding, which allows C/EBPbeta to bind more efficiently to the LTR. Inhibition of p65 expression by siRNA significantly decreases C/EBPbeta-binding and LTR expression. Using ChIP assay, we confirmed the existence of an interchange between p65 and C/EBPbeta and their abilities to bind to the LTR in vivo. These observations demonstrate that a delicate balance of interaction between p65, C/EBPbeta, and Tat can dictate the level of HIV-1 LTR transcription."
Doc No.582,431,negative/unlabeled,8.957855,TATA-dependent repression of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 transcription by the adenovirus E1A 243R oncoprotein.,"Human adenovirus E1A oncoprotein activates or represses transcription from a variety of viral and cellular promoters by several complex mechanisms. The E1A products, 289R and 243R, have differential effects on transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR). Previous reports indicate that repression of HIV-1 LTR-directed gene expression by E1A 243R is mediated through the kappa B enhancer elements located between nucleotides -105 and -82 relative to the transcription initiation start site (+1). Results from this study suggest a novel mechanism for transcriptional repression of the HIV-1 LTR by E1A 243R that is enhancer-independent and that is mediated through basal HIV-1 promoter elements. Transient expression assays, in which 5'-truncated or site-directed mutant HIV-1 LTR-CAT reporters were tested for their response to repression mediated by wild-type or mutant 243R, demonstrate that LTR sequences upstream of -31 relative to the transcription initiation start site (+1) and inclusive of the enhancer elements are dispensable for 243R-mediated repression. The ability of 243R to repress HIV-1 basal promoter activity requires both an intact N-terminus of E1A 243R and the TATA element within the HIV-1 promoter. These results support a novel mechanism for E1A 243R-induced transcriptional repression that is enhancer-independent and that targets directly the general transcription machinery."

This suppressive effect on HIV replication in experimentally infected CD4 cells has so far been demonstrated only for CD8 cells from HIV-seropositive individuals. In the present study we have investigated if CD8 cells from HIV-negative individuals can also suppress HIV replication in experimentally infected CD4 cells. Positively selected CD4 cells were infected with phenotypically different primary isolates of HIV type 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2). Graded numbers of CD8 cells were added to the infected cultures. The T cells were activated by antibodies directed against the CD3 molecule or the T cell receptor. Culture supernatants were harvested for HIV p24 quantitation and the CD8 suppression of HIV replication was calculated by comparing p24 levels from parallel cultures in the presence or absence of CD8 cells from different donors. We show that CD8 cells from unexposed HIV-seronegative blood donors are able to control HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication in experimentally infected autologous CD4 cells. The antiviral activity of CD8 cells from and HIV-naive individual was reproducible over time and the suppressive effect was comparable to that seen with CD8 cells from HIV-positive individuals. The infected cells were not eliminated from the cultures. The suppressive effect of CD8 cells varied depending on the dose and biological phenotype of the virus used for infection. Thus, exposure to HIV in vivo is not a prerequisite for CD8 cells to exert a suppressive effect on HIV replication in acutely infected cells."

The aim of this study was to assess the role of medical procedures in transmission of hepatitis C in north-eastern Poland. In total, 194 patients with chronic hepatitis C were eligible for the study. The control group consisted of 275 age- and sex-matched individuals. Patients with a history of intravenous drug use were excluded. On multivariate analysis, transfusions [odds ratio (OR) = 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-6.3], minor surgery (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.5-6.7) and dental care (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.4-4.0) were independently associated with HCV infection. We conclude that apart from transfusion, minor medical procedures and dental care may carry a significant risk of hepatitis C infection. Improvements in basic hygiene routines and strict adherence to universal precautions may be essential to prevent iatrogenic transmission of the infection."

A long-lived reservoir of latently infected CD4(+) memory T cells represents the most important sanctuary for the virus and the greatest obstacle for viral eradication. In this work, we present an initial step toward a gene therapy approach aimed at the activation of latent provirus to induce the death of latently infected T cells. Latent HIV-1 infection is characterized by the failure of viral gene expression as a consequence of uninitiated or aborted transcription. We have constructed an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector (p5p53RTAT3) that expresses the viral trans-activating protein Tat in a drug-regulated manner and p53 in a Rev-dependent manner. We have demonstrated that the Tat-expressed protein from p5p53RTAT3 vector reactivates latent HIV-1 proviruses in J1.1 and ACH-2 cell lines and promotes p53-induced apoptosis in the presence of Rev. Our system was able to trigger the trans-activation of the provirus 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), stimulate the expression of the Rev protein from a tat-defective provirus, and provoke apoptosis selectively in the cells transfected with a tat-defective HIV-1 provirus in contrast to those with no HIV-1 provirus. However, the Rev-dependent p53 killing of latently infected cells was not effective enough for complete elimination of the awakened HIV-1 viruses. In summary, we have developed a vector system that is efficient in activating latent HIV-1 proviruses but that needs further improvement to kill infected cells."
Doc No.586,5905,negative/unlabeled,8.942117,CXCR4 is a functional coreceptor for infection of human macrophages by CXCR4-dependent primary HIV-1 isolates.,"The identification of HIV-1 coreceptors has provided a molecular basis for the tropism of different HIV-1 strains. CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) mediates the entry of both primary and T cell line-adapted (TCLA) syncytia-inducing strains. Although macrophages (M phi) express CXCR4, this coreceptor is assumed to be nonfunctional for HIV-1 infection. We addressed this apparent paradox by infecting human monocyte-derived M phi with primary and TCLA isolates that were rigorously characterized for coreceptor usage and by adding the natural CXCR4 ligand, stem cell differentiation factor-1, to specifically block CXCR4-mediated entry. Our results show that primary HIV-1 isolates that selectively use CXCR4 productively infected both normal and C-C chemokine receptor-5-null M phi. By contrast, M phi supported the entry of CXCR4-dependent TCLA strains with variable efficiency but were not productively infected. Thus, the tropism of HIV isolates results from complex virus/host cell interactions both at the entry and postentry levels."
Doc No.587,5888,negative/unlabeled,8.940425,A framework for understanding factors that affect access and utilization of treatment for hepatitis C virus infection among HCV-mono-infected and HIV/HCV-co-infected injection drug users.,"Treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) is rarely received by injection drug users (IDU), particularly those co-infected with HIV. We propose a framework for understanding factors that affect utilization and adherence to HCV therapy among HCV mono-infected and HIV/HCV-co-infected IDU. Provision of treatment requires calculation of risks and benefits including evaluation of a number of time-varying factors that collectively determine a gradient of treatment eligibility, advisability and acceptability, the relative importance of which may differ in co-infected and mono-infected IDU. Treatment eligibility is determined by a number of non-modifiable and modifiable contraindications, the latter of which can change over time rendering patients who were once ineligible eligible. Among those eligible, treatment need can be assessed by liver biopsy and therapy may be deferred in those with no liver disease and started in those with significant liver disease. Among those with moderate disease, further consideration of treatment advisability (medical factors that affect treatment response) and acceptability (individual, provider and environmental barriers) is needed before treatment decisions are made. These factors are dynamic and thus should be continually evaluated even among those who may not initially appear to be ready for treatment. An evaluation of this framework is needed to determine applicability and feasibility. Until then, treatment decisions should be made on an individual basis after careful consideration of these issues by provider and patient and efforts to develop novel strategies for identifying IDU who need treatment most (alternatives to liver biopsy) and multidimensional approaches to deliver treatment for HCV while addressing other factors including HIV infection, depression and drug use should be continued."
Doc No.588,7295,negative/unlabeled,8.93651,Viral replication capacity as a correlate of HLA B57/B5801-associated nonprogressive HIV-1 infection.,"HLA B57 and the closely related HLA B5801 are over-represented among HIV-1 infected long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs). It has been suggested that this association between HLA B57/5801 and asymptomatic survival is a consequence of strong CTL responses against epitopes in the viral Gag protein. Moreover, CTL escape mutations in Gag would coincide with viral attenuation, resulting in low viral load despite evasion from immune control. In this study we compared HLA B57/5801 HIV-1 infected progressors and LTNPs for sequence variation in four dominant epitopes in Gag and their ability to generate CTL responses against these epitopes and the autologous escape variants. Prevalence and appearance of escape mutations in Gag epitopes and potential compensatory mutations were similar in HLA B57/5801 LTNPs and progressors. Both groups were also indistinguishable in the magnitude of CD8+ IFN-gamma responses directed against the wild-type or autologous escape mutant Gag epitopes in IFN-gamma ELISPOT analysis. Interestingly, HIV-1 variants from HLA B57/5801 LTNPs had much lower replication capacity than the viruses from HLA B57/5801 progressors, which did not correlate with specific mutations in Gag. In conclusion, the different clinical course of HLA B57/5801 LTNPs and progressors was not associated with differences in CTL escape mutations or CTL activity against epitopes in Gag but rather with differences in HIV-1 replication capacity."
Doc No.589,9618,negative/unlabeled,8.934506,CD11b-bearing mononuclear leucocytes and IgA levels in the staging of human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"Certain immunological parameters (i.e. low CD4+ T cell numbers, high serum soluble CD8) have been described as prognostic factors for the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to later clinical stages. In the present study we have found in one hundred HIV-infected Spanish patients (81% drug abusers, 7% homosexuals, 6% heterosexuals, and 6% other or unknown risk groups) that CD11b+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells are increased in those with persistent lymphadenopathy as compared to other clinical stages (asymptomatic, AIDS-related complex and AIDS). Serum IgA was significantly increased in AIDS patients, and in patients at any other clinical stage who had concomitant infections (mainly mycobacterial and fungal). CD11b (an integrin with complement receptor functions) may thus be of clinical interest for the staging of HIV-infected patients, and reflect stage-selective immunological changes in mononuclear cell biology during HIV infection. High IgA on the other hand, would be a marker of concomitant infection as well as of disease progression. The results concern mostly drug addicts (the main risk group in Spain), but may apply to the other risk groups because no significant differences were detected between drug addicts (n = 81) and non-drug addicts (n = 19) for the studied variables (p greater than 0.05)."
Doc No.590,1083,negative/unlabeled,8.9306555,T-cell therapy for chronic viral hepatitis.,"Although therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection has delivered remarkable cure rates, curative therapies for hepatitis B virus (HBV) may only be available in the distant future. The possibility to eliminate or at least stably maintain low levels of HBV replication under the control of a functional anti-host response has stimulated the development of specific immunotherapies for HBV infection. We reviewed the development of T-cell therapy for HBV, highlighting its potential antiviral efficiency but also its potential toxicities in different groups of chronic HBV patients. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are the only two communicable diseases in which there have been increases in related morbidity and mortality over the past 20 years [1]. Both viruses are chronically infecting about 500 million people (HBV ~350 million, HCV ~150 million) and represent the seventh most frequent cause of death worldwide [1]. HBV and HCV are hepatotropic, non-cytopathic viruses able to establish persistent infections that cause different degrees of hepatic inflammation (chronic hepatitis), leading to the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The two viruses are unrelated and virologically different. HCV remains prevalent in North America and Europe, whereas chronic hepatitis B is prevalent in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [1,2]. HCV is an RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, and HBV is a DNA virus of the Hepadnaviridae family and uses reverse transcriptase to synthesize its DNA from a pre-genomic RNA form [3]. HCV is able to activate in the infected host a classical type I interferon (IFN)-mediated innate response [3], whereas HBV generally escapes innate immune recognition and does not activate type I IFN-mediated immunity. Chronic HBV and HCV infections are both characterized by quantitative and functional defects of virus-specific T-cell response [4,5]. The frequency of virus-specific T cells is extremely low, and virus-specific T cells show features of exhaustion in both chronic HBV and HCV patients [6]. However, the quantitative and functional defects are more pronounced in HBV infections, with T cells virtually undetectable in the blood of many chronic HBV patients by ex vivo analysis [7-9]. In addition, while frequency and impact of viral mutations in T cell epitopes are frequently detectable in HCV infections [10], viral mutations affecting CD8 T-cell epitopes are scarcer in chronic HBV patients [6,11,12]. Of extreme practical importance in relation to the potential impact of T-cell therapy for HBV and HCV are the efficacies of currently available treatments. New therapies for HCV have delivered remarkable cure rates, with more than 90% of patients achieving viral clearance with all oral direct-acting antivirals [13]. In contrast, curative therapies for HBV will not be available until the distant future (14). Thus, although it is difficult to see a possible therapeutic advantage of a new T-cell-based therapy in chronic HCV patients, the fact that current therapies for HBV only partially suppress but do not eliminate HBV from the infected host has encouraged research for new and more radical therapies designed to eliminate or at least stably maintain low levels of HBV replication under the control of a functional anti-host response. For these reasons, in this review, we concentrate on the development of T-cell therapy for HBV. T-cell therapy for HCV chronic infection is certainly important for understanding the mechanisms of T-cell antiviral control [15,16], but their use for therapy appears unlikely."
Doc No.591,7851,negative/unlabeled,8.9271345,Disseminated histoplasmosis presenting as pyoderma gangrenosum-like lesions in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.,"A 33-year-old Hispanic woman with newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a CD4 T-lymphocyte count of 2, viral load of 730,000 copies/mL, candidal esophagitis, seizure disorder, a history of bacterial pneumonia, and recent weight loss was admitted with tonic clonic seizure. On admission, her vital signs were: pulse of 88, respiration rate of 18, temperature of 37.7 degrees C, and blood pressure of 126/76. Her only medication was phenytoin. On examination, the patient was found to have multiple umbilicated papules on her face, as well as painful, erythematous, large, punched-out ulcers on the nose, face, trunk, and extremities of 3 months' duration (Fig. 1). The borders of the ulcers were irregular, raised, boggy, and undermined, while the base contained hemorrhagic exudate partially covered with necrotic eschar. The largest ulcer on the left mandible was 4 cm in diameter. The oral cavity was clear. Because of her subtherapeutic phenytoin level, the medication dose was adjusted, and she was empirically treated with Unasyn for presumptive bacterial infection. Chest radiograph and head computed tomography (CT) scan were within normal limits. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear was negative. Serologic studies, including Histoplasma antibodies, toxoplasmosis immunoglobulin M (IgM), rapid plasma reagin (RPR), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies were all negative. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was within normal limits without the presence of cryptococcal antigen. Blood and cerebrospinal cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were all negative. Viral culture from one of the lesions was also negative. The analysis of her complete blood count showed: white blood count, 2300/microl; hemoglobin, 8.5 g/dL; hematocrit, 25.7%; and platelets, 114,000/microl. Two days after admission, the dermatology service was asked to evaluate the patient. Although the umbilicated papules on the patient's face resembled lesions of molluscum contagiosum, other infectious processes considered in the differential diagnosis included histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and Penicillium marnefei. In addition, the morphology of the ulcers, particularly that on the left mandible, resembled lesions of pyoderma gangrenosum. A skin biopsy was performed on an ulcer on the chest. Histopathologic examination revealed granulomatous dermatitis with multiple budding yeast forms, predominantly within histiocytes, with few organisms residing extracellularly. Methenamine silver stain confirmed the presence of 2-4 microm fungal spores suggestive of Histoplasma capsulatum (Fig. 2). Because of the patient's deteriorating condition, intravenous amphotericin B was initiated after tissue culture was obtained. Within the first week of treatment, the skin lesions started to resolve. Histoplasma capsulatum was later isolated by culture, confirming the diagnosis. The patient was continued on amphotericin B for a total of 10 weeks, and was started on lamivudine, stavudine, and nelfinavir for her HIV infection during hospitalization. After amphotericin B therapy, the patient was placed on life-long suppressive therapy with itraconazole. Follow-up at 9 months after the initial presentation revealed no evidence of relapse of histoplasmosis."
Doc No.592,2160,negative/unlabeled,8.923778,Effects of TH1 and TH2 cytokines on CD8+ cell response against human immunodeficiency virus: implications for long-term survival.,"CD8+ cells from long-term survivors [LTS; infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 10 or more years and having CD4+ cell counts of > or = 500 cells per microliters] have a 3-fold greater ability to suppress HIV replication than do CD8+ cells from patients who have progressed to disease (progressors) during the same time period. A change in the pattern of cytokines produced in the host from those that typically favor cell-mediated immunity (T helper 1, TH1 or type 1) to those that down-regulate it (T helper 2, TH2 or type 2) was investigated as a cause of this reduced CD8+ cell anti-HIV function. Treatment of CD8+ cells from LTS with the TH1 cytokine interleukin (IL)-2 enhanced their anti-HIV activity, whereas exposure of these cells to TH2 cytokines IL-4 or IL-10 reduced their ability to suppress HIV replication and to produce IL-2. IL-2 could prevent and reverse the inhibitory effects of IL-4 and IL-10. Moreover, prolonged exposure of CD8+ cells from some progressors to IL-2 improved the ability of these cells to suppress HIV replication. These observations support previous findings suggesting that strong CD8+ cell responses play an important role in maintaining an asymptomatic state in HIV infection. The data suggest that the loss of CD8+ cell suppression of HIV replication associated with disease progression results from a shift in cytokine production within the infected host from a TH1 to a TH2 pattern. Modulation of these cytokines could provide benefit to HIV-infected individuals by improving their CD8+ cell anti-HIV activity."

In the present study, we used a modified method that allowed a direct measurement of intracellular cytokines in CD4+ CD8- T cells. A total of 48 HIV-1-infected (HIV+) and 16 HIV-1-uninfected (HIV-) individuals were studied. The percentages of CD4+ CD8- T cells producing interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-4 (IL-4), or interleukin-5 (IL-5) in HIV+ and HIV- subjects were 23.6% versus 34.9% (P < 0.01), 13.7% versus 13.2%, 1.3% versus 1.0%, and 1. 2% versus 0.9%, respectively. The population of IL-2-producing cells decreased proportionately with reductions in CD4 counts (< 200/mm3, 200-500/mm3, and > 500/mm3 to 18.0%, 23.5%, and 30.5%, P < 0.05, respectively). There was an inverse correlation between the percentage of IL-2-producing cells and plasma viral load (r = - 0. 446, P < 0.05). However, the percentages of CD4+ CD8- T cells producing other cytokines were not different between HIV+ and HIV-. Our cross-sectional study demonstrated a decrease in IL-2-producing cells but not the Th1 to the Th2 shift in the CD4+ CD8- T cell population in the moderate and advanced stages of HIV-1-infection."
Doc No.594,6986,positive/labeled,8.920688,Patients with discordant responses to antiretroviral therapy have impaired killing of HIV-infected T cells.,"In medicine, understanding the pathophysiologic basis of exceptional circumstances has led to an enhanced understanding of biology. We have studied the circumstance of HIV-infected patients in whom antiretroviral therapy results in immunologic benefit, despite virologic failure. In such patients, two protease mutations, I54V and V82A, occur more frequently. Expressing HIV protease containing these mutations resulted in less cell death, caspase activation, and nuclear fragmentation than wild type (WT) HIV protease or HIV protease containing other mutations. The impaired induction of cell death was also associated with impaired cleavage of procaspase 8, a requisite event for HIV protease mediated cell death. Primary CD4 T cells expressing I54V or V82A protease underwent less cell death than with WT or other mutant proteases. Human T cells infected with HIV containing these mutations underwent less cell death and less Casp8p41 production than WT or HIV containing other protease mutations, despite similar degrees of viral replication. The reductions in cell death occurred both within infected cells, as well as in uninfected bystander cells. These data indicate that single point mutations within HIV protease which are selected in vivo can significantly impact the ability of HIV to kill CD4 T cells, while not impacting viral replication. Therefore, HIV protease regulates both HIV replication as well as HIV induced T cell depletion, the hallmark of HIV pathogenesis."
Doc No.595,8039,negative/unlabeled,8.917681,A comparison of modified directly observed therapy to standard care for chronic hepatitis C.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States. Effective treatments are available, however adherence to treatment is challenging. Modified directly observed therapy (mDOT) with weekly administration of pegylated interferon might improve adherence and outcomes for patients infected with chronic HCV. The purpose of this study was to compare two treatment protocols and examine predictors of sustained virologic response (SVR). This retrospective review compares HCV treatment outcomes in two outpatient clinics at an urban academic medical center. Gastroenterology fellows provided standard treatment (SC) in one clinic; a nurse practitioner administered weekly pegylated interferon injections weekly in a primary care clinic. All patients received oral ribavirin. Data was extracted from the medical records of all treated patients over a 5-year period. 155 treatment-naïve, chronically infected HCV patients were treated. Ninety-seven patients received mDOT treatment and 58 received standard care. Mean age was 46 years. Genotype 1 represented 59 % of the sample. The mDOT patients were significantly more likely to be younger (44 vs. 50 years), have a history of injection drug use (93.1 vs. 50.0 %), and be HIV-infected (13.5 vs. 2 %) compared to SC patients. The overall SVR rate was 45.2 % and did not differ between the groups in unadjusted analyses (p = 0.95). Genotype was the only predictor of SVR. Patients treated by nurse practitioners trained in HCV care and seen weekly for interferon injections have comparable treatment outcomes to patients treated by specialists. "
Doc No.596,3865,negative/unlabeled,8.910884,Specific mutations of hepatitis B virus in plasma predict liver cancer development.,"A major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is hepatitis B virus (HBV), whose pathogenesis is exacerbated by the acquisition of mutations that accelerate carcinogenesis. We examined, with mass spectrometry, the temporality of an HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) double mutation in plasma and tumors. Initial studies found that 52 of 70 (74.3%) tumors from patients residing in Qidong, People's Republic of China, contained this HBV mutation. Paired plasma samples were available for six of the tumor specimens; four tumors had the HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) mutation, whereas three of the paired plasma samples were also positive. The potential predictive value of this biomarker was explored by using stored plasma samples from a study of 120 residents of Qidong who had been monitored for aflatoxin exposure and HBV infection. After 10 years of passive follow-up, there were six cases of major liver disease including HCC (four cases), hepatitis (one case), and cirrhosis (one case). All six cases had detectable levels of the HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) mutation up to 8 years before diagnosis. Finally, 15 liver cancers were selected from a prospective cohort of 1,638 high-risk individuals in Qidong on the basis of available plasma samples spanning the years before and after diagnosis. The HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) mutation was detected in 8 of the 15 cases (53.3%) before cancer. The persistence of detection of this mutation was statistically significant (P = 0.022, two-tailed). We therefore found that a prediagnosis biomarker of specific HBV mutations can be measured in plasma and suggest this marker for use as an intermediate endpoint in prevention and intervention trials."
Doc No.597,2071,negative/unlabeled,8.899715,The role of support group and duration of infection in HIV/AIDS patients' knowledge and attitudes to their illness.,"To assess the association between support group membership, socio-demographic and HIV related factors including knowledge and attitude of illness in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs). Seventy-six participants with HIV who were on follow-up management at three non-governmental care and treatment agencies in south western, Nigeria were asked to complete a questionnaire detailing their demographic characteristics, duration of awareness of HIV status, medication status, membership of a support group, HIV-related knowledge (including number of workshops/seminars attended, reading of literature), and attitude toward their illness and treatment. Compared to those who did not belong to a support group, (34, 45%), those who did (42, 55%) were significantly more knowledgeable about HIV-related (t=4.02, p=0.00) and also reported more favorable attitudes toward the illness and its treatment (t=3.38, p=0.005). A multiple regression analysis indicated that group membership and a longer period of awareness of HIV infection contributed significantly to illness knowledge and attitudes. Age, sex, years of education, medication status, and employment status did not contribute significantly to these outcome variables. Individuals living with HIV/AIDS who belonged to a support group and had availed themselves of relevant literature were more knowledgeable and positive about their illness than those who did not belong to support groups. HIV/AIDS support group membership is an important component of psycho-social care in HIV/AIDS patients in Nigeria and should be encouraged."
Doc No.598,8168,negative/unlabeled,8.897949,"Kinetic factors control efficiencies of cell entry, efficacies of entry inhibitors, and mechanisms of adaptation of human immunodeficiency virus.","Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in diverse conditions limiting for viral entry into cells frequently leads to adaptive mutations in the V3 loop of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein. This has suggested that the V3 loop limits the efficiencies of HIV-1 infections, possibly by directly affecting gp120-coreceptor affinities. In contrast, V3 loop mutations that enable HIV-1(JR-CSF) to use the low-affinity mutant coreceptor CCR5(Y14N) are shown here to have negligible effects on the virus-coreceptor affinity but to dramatically accelerate the irreversible conformational conversion of the envelope gp41 subunits from a three-stranded coil into a six-helix bundle. This slow step is blocked irreversibly by the inhibitor T-20. To further evaluate the role of entry rates in controlling infection efficiencies and viral adaptations, we developed methods to quantitatively measure viral entry kinetics. The virions were adsorbed by spinoculation at 4 degrees C onto HeLa-CD4/CCR5 cell clones that either had limiting or saturating concentrations of CCR5. After warming to 37 degrees C, the completion of entry was monitored over time by the resistance of infections to the competitive CCR5 inhibitor TAK-779. Our results suggest that the efficiency of entry of cell-attached infectious HIV-1 is principally controlled by three kinetic processes. The first is a lag phase that is caused in part by the concentration-dependent reversible association of virus with CD4 and CCR5 to form an equilibrium assemblage of complexes. Second, this assembly step lowers but does not eliminate a large activation energy barrier for a rate-limiting, CCR5-dependent conformational change in gp41 that is sensitive to blockage by T-20. The rate of infection therefore depends on the fraction of infectious virions that are sufficiently saturated with CCR5 to undergo this conformational change and on the magnitude of the activation energy barrier. Although only a small fraction of fully assembled viral complexes overcome this barrier per hour, the ensuing steps of entry are rapidly completed within 5 to 10 min. Thus, this barrier limits the overall flow rate at which the attached virions enter cells, but it has no effect on the lag time that precedes this entry flow. Third, a relatively rapid and kinetically dominant process of viral inactivation, which may partly involve endocytosis, competes with infectious viral entry. Our results suggest that the V3 loop of gp120 has a major effect on the rate-limiting coreceptor-dependent conformational change in gp41 and that adaptive viral mutations, including V3 loop mutations, function kinetically by accelerating this inherently slow step in the entry pathway."
Doc No.599,926,negative/unlabeled,8.89752,Limited magnitude and breadth in the HLA-A2-restricted CD8 T-Cell response to Nef in children with vertically acquired HIV-1 infection.,"CD8 T cells are believed to play a key role in the immune control of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in children as well as in adults. We have used an enhanced EliSpot (AmpliSpot) assay to quantitate CD8 T-cell responses directed to five human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-presented HIV-1 epitopes derived from the key viral antigen Nef. Responses were assayed in one group of 21 children with vertically acquired HIV infection and one group of 19 adult subjects with chronic infection. The paediatric group displayed significantly weaker and more narrowly focused CD8 T-cell responses as compared with the adult subjects. Two epitopes stood out as the most frequently and strongly recognized, suggesting that they should be considered immunodominant in the CD8 T-cell response to HIV-1 Nef. Interestingly, the most frequently and strongly recognized epitope in both adults and children was previously identified in HLA-A2-transgenic mice, demonstrating the usefulness of such mice in finding natural viral epitopes. These findings indicate significant weakness in strength and breadth of the CD8 T-cell response to the target protein Nef in infected children and prompt renewed efforts into the immunology of vertically acquired HIV-1 infection."

We sought to identify individual-level, interpersonal, and structural factors associated with HAART use among active IDUs to inform comprehensive, contextually tailored intervention to improve the HAART use of IDUs. Prospective data from three semiannual assessments were combined, and logistic general estimating equations were used to identify variables associated with taking HAART 6 months later. Participants were a community sample of HIV-seropositive, active IDUs enrolled in the INSPIRE study, a U.S. multisite (Baltimore, Miami, New York, San Francisco) prevention intervention. The analytic sample included 1,225 observations, and comprised 62% males, 75% active drug users, 75% non-Hispanic blacks, and 55% with a CD4 count <350; 48% reported HAART use. Adjusted analyses indicated that the later HAART use of IDUs was independently predicted by patient-provider engagement, stable housing, medical coverage, and more HIV primary care visits. Significant individual factors included not currently using drugs and a positive attitude about HAART benefits even if using illicit drugs. Those who reported patient-centered interactions with their HIV primary care provider had a 45% greater odds of later HAART use, and those with stable housing had twofold greater odds. These findings suggest that interventions to improve the HIV treatment of IDUs and to reduce their HIV health disparities should be comprehensive, promoting better patient-provider engagement, stable housing, HAART education with regard to illicit drug use, and integration of drug-abuse treatment with HIV primary care."

In this study, IL-4 did not induce virus production, but inhibited phorbol esters (PMA)-stimulated HIV expression in chronically infected promonocytic U1 cells. This effect, however, was not accounted for by a decreased secretion of endogenous TNF-alpha induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). We also observed that PMA upregulated the production of both IL-1beta and of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). IL-4 inhibited the secretion of IL-1beta and strongly increased that of IL-1ra; however, these effects were not responsible of IL-4-mediated inhibition of PMA-induced HIV expression since anti-IL-1ra antibodies did not revert IL-4 mediated suppression. U1 cells were transiently transfected with both wild-type (WT) long terminal repeat (LTR) constructs, or with LTR plasmids containing deletions of either the NF-kappaB or the Sp-1 binding sites. IL-4 inhibited LTR-driven transcription triggered by PMA stimulation of U1 cells, and this effect was dependent upon intact NF-kappaB but not Sp-1 binding sites. Thus, IL-4 may favour a state of microbiological quiescence in infected monocytic cells bypassing the induction of HIV expression mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines."

Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study.,"Magnetic resonance (MR) scans were performed as part of a prospective neuropsychological study within the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Fifty HIV-1-seronegative men, 85 HIV-1-seropositive men without constitutional symptoms, and 14 with symptomatic HIV disease underwent MR imaging using a uniform protocol. Scans were rated by neuroradiologists blinded to all clinical details except age. The majority of MR scans were normal in all of the clinical groups and no covert mass lesions or diffuse white matter abnormalities were identified. Focal hyperintensities in the white matter were observed in 24% of the HIV-1 seronegatives, 26% of HIV-1 asymptomatic seropositives (CDC II/III), and 17% of those with ARC/AIDS. No significant associations were noted between the white matter hyperintensities and HIV-1 serostatus, neurological abnormalities, CD4 count, alcohol or drug use, hypertension, or smoking. In one individual classified with early HIV-1 dementia, MR demonstrated several hyperintensities in the deep parietal white matter, but at autopsy no microscopic abnormalities corresponding to the MR findings were identified. Our studies imply that focal white matter hyperintensities identified on MR are not specific for HIV-1 infection and are probably incidental and of no clinical significance."

A substantial proportion of unstimulated T cells from the peripheral blood of patients but not controls expressed HLA-DR; in contrast the IL-2 and transferrin receptors were rarely expressed spontaneously in either group and there was no difference in spontaneous lymphocyte transformation. After stimulation with monocyte-dependent T-cell mitogens, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) or anti-T3, patients had significantly reduced expression of the IL-2 and transferrin receptors and of HLA-DR in association with impaired lymphocyte transformations compared to controls. In contrast, lymphocyte activation was normal in response to the monocyte-independent T-cell mitogen phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA). These data confirm that the process of T-cell activation is abnormal in chronic HBV carriers but suggest that the T cell is intrinsically normal. In allogeneic co-cultures, monocytes from patients inhibited the transformation of normal and patients' lymphocytes in response to PHA, suggesting that defects of T-cell-mediated immunity in chronic HBV carriers may be a consequence of monocyte dysfunction."

Resistance to ENF arises via mutations in the drug binding site in HR-1. In addition, HR-2 mutations are commonly observed in ENF-resistant Env proteins, though their role remains unclear. We explored the mechanistic basis for clinical resistance to ENF and the role of HR-2 mutations. Using panels of ENF resistance-associated mutants for two patients, we found that mutations in HR-1 slowed the fusion kinetics and that mutations in HR-2 restored fusion rates. We assessed the differences in the rates of fusion of these mutants from a temperature-arrested state and observed similar trends, suggesting that the step of delay occurs after coreceptor engagement. Sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies was unchanged by the HR-1 and HR-2 mutants in each panel. Since this result was in contrast to those of a previous in vitro analysis where enhanced sensitivity to neutralization was demonstrated for heterologous Envs with ENF resistance-associated HR-1 changes, we examined the context dependence of HR-1 and HR-2 mutations by transferring the mutations seen in one patient into the Env context of another. These studies revealed that some, but not all, HR-1 mutations, when placed out of context (i.e., in a patient Env where they did not originally arise), enhance sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. However, in most cases, HR-1 mutations in ENF-treated patients evolve in a manner that preserves pretreatment neutralization sensitivity so as to evade the pressures of the immune system."
Doc No.605,7884,negative/unlabeled,8.869836,Modelling the association between adherence and viral load in HIV-infected patients.,"The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of adherence to prescribed antiretroviral therapy on virologic response measured repeatedly over time in HIV-infected patients. To this end observations on plasma viral load (HIV RNA) assessed in copies/ml are categorized into four clinically meaningful states, [0--50[, [50--400[, [400--2000[, [2000 and up. A time-dependent continuation ratio model is used to analyse longitudinal ordinal responses. The main challenge lies in modelling dependencies over time and using information contained in the data efficiently to establish a dynamic relation between observed patient adherence and viral load. Among the several measures of adherence investigated, two specifically account for long periods of time without intake. One is derived from the third moment of the inter-dose interval distribution, while the second reflects internal drug exposure using pharmacokinetic parameters. The approach is applied to a clinical trial involving 35 patients who were followed over 12 months. Results demonstrate a significant relation between patient adherence and virologic response."

The chemokines RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta were identified as the major HIV-SF produced by CD8+ T cells. Two active proteins purified from the culture supernatant of an immortalized CD8+ T cell clone revealed sequence identity with human RANTES and MIP-1 alpha. RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta were released by both immortalized and primary CD8+ T cells. HIV-SF activity produced by these cells was completely blocked by a combination of neutralizing antibodies against RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta. Recombinant human RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta induced a dose-dependent inhibition of different strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). These data may have relevance for the prevention and therapy of AIDS."

Viruses can manipulate the cellular processes necessary for their replication by targeting the host RNAi machinery. This study explores the effect of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) transactivating protein Tax on the RNAi pathway in the context of a chromosomally integrated viral long terminal repeat (LTR) using a CD4(+) T-cell line, Jurkat. Transcription factor profiling of the HTLV-1 LTR stably integrated T-cell clone transfected with Tax demonstrates increased activation of substrates and factors associated with chromatin remodeling complexes. Using a miRNA microarray and bioinformatics experimental approach, Tax was also shown to downregulate the expression of miRNAs associated with the translational regulation of factors required for chromatin remodeling. These observations were validated with selected miRNAs and an HTLV-1 infected T cells line, MT-2. miR-149 and miR-873 were found to be capable of directly targeting p300 and p/CAF, chromatin remodeling factors known to play critical role in HTLV-1 pathogenesis. Overall, these results are first in line establishing HTLV-1/Tax-miRNA-chromatin concept and open new avenues toward understanding retroviral latency and/or replication in a given cell type."
Doc No.608,7146,negative/unlabeled,8.861269,Immune reconstitution in HIV-1-infected individuals treated with potent antiretroviral therapy.,"Potent combination antiretroviral therapy that was introduced in the mid-1990s for treatment of HIV-1 infection has resulted in unprecedented decreases in HIV-1 replication and increases in CD4+ T cell counts in many individuals. Coincident with the introduction of potent combination antiretroviral therapy, substantial declines in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality have been observed. Although these declines strongly suggest that significant immune reconstitution is occurring, increasing evidence suggests that immune reconstitution is neither uniform nor complete in all treated individuals. Clinical data suggest that some HIV-1-associated malignancies have not declined despite the new therapies, and that not all treated individuals reconstitute CD4+ T cell numbers to normal values. Laboratory studies reveal that immune responses to ubiquitous antigens are reconstituted, but that responses to rarely encountered antigens, such as tetanus, are not reconstituted without repeat vaccination. Many questions remain concerning the extent and clinical significance of the immune reconstitution that occurs in the setting of antiretroviral drug therapy. A better understanding of the nature of the immune reconstitution that results from potent antiretroviral therapy is critical to the optimal clinical management of HIV-1-infected individuals, and may provide important insights into the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 infection as well."
Doc No.609,1465,negative/unlabeled,8.857688,Prevalence of drug resistance-related polymorphisms in treatment-naive individuals infected with nonsubtype B HIV type 1 in Cameroon.,"Mutations associated with the use of protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors have been mostly mapped for HIV-1 subtype B. The prevalence of these mutations in drug-naive HIV-1 subtype B-infected individuals is low but occurs at high frequencies in treated individuals. To determine the prevalence of treatment-associated mutations in non-B viruses, we analyzed a 1613-bp pol region of specimens collected from 57 HIV-1-infected treatment-naive individuals from Cameroon. Of the 57 HIV-1 sequences, 43 belonged to CRF02-AG, two to CRF11-cpx, six to subtype A, one to subtype D, and five were unclassifiable. Of the 57 PR sequences, 100% contained at least one codon change giving substitutions at positions 10, 11, 16, 20, 33, 36, 60, 62, 64, 69, 77, and 89. These substitutions gave the following prevalence pattern, 36I/L (100%, 57/57) >89M/I (98%, 56/57)>69K/R (93%, 53/57)>20I/R (89%, 51/57)>16E (16%, 9/57)>64M (12%, 7/57)>10I (11%, 6/57)>11V (5%, 3/57)=62V (5%, 3/57)=77I (5%, 3/57)>233F/V (4%, 2/57)=60E (4%), which differed significantly from subtype B at positions 20, 36, 69, and 89. All but one (98%) of the 57 RT sequences (438 amino acid residues) carried substitutions located at codons 39A (7%), 43E (7%), 122E (7%), 312Q (2%), 333E (2%), 335C/D (89%), 356K (89%), 358K (14%), 365I (2%), 371V (81%), 376S (11%), or 399D (4%); the frequency of these substitutions ranged from <0.5% to 4% in RT of subtype B. The high prevalence of minor mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PI) and reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTI) represents natural polymorphisms. HIV-1 PR and RT sequences from antiretroviral (ARV)-naive HIV-infected persons in Cameroon are important for monitoring the development of resistance to PIs and RTIs as such mutations could lead to treatment failures in individuals undergoing ARV therapy."

The current prevalences and risk factors for HIV/HTLV-1/-2 were evaluated in 1,608 patients attending the AIDS/STD Reference and Training Center in São Paulo. Blood samples were analyzed for HTLV-1/2-specific antibodies using enzyme immunoassays (EIA Murex HTLV-I+II, Diasorin, and Gold ELISA HTLV-I+II, REM) and immunoblotting (HTLV Blot 2.4, MP Biomedicals and INNO-LIA HTLV-I/II, Innogenetics) and for the pol proviral DNA segments of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 by ""in-house"" real-time PCR. These analyses revealed that 50 (3.11%) of the samples were HTLV positive, including 25 (1.55%) that were HTLV-1 positive, 21 (1.31%) that were HTLV-2 positive, and 4 (0.25%) that were HTLV positive (untypeable). The median age of the HIV/HTLV-coinfected individuals was 50 years versus 44 years in the overall population (p=0.000). The risk factors associated with HIV/HTLV-1/-2 coinfections were female gender (OR 3.26, 1.78-5.95), black/pardo color (OR 2.21, 1.21-4.03), infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) (OR 4.27, 2.32-7.87) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) (OR 24.40, 12.51-48.11), and intravenous drug use (IDU) (OR 30.01, 15.21-59.29). The current low prevalence of HTLV-1/2 in HIV-infected patients in São Paulo could be explained in part by programs providing IDUs with sterile needles and syringes and changes in the drug usage patterns of individuals from injecting cocaine to smoking crack cocaine.

To obtain insight into NRTI resistance, we used a new sequencing technology to characterize the spectrum of low-prevalence NRTI-resistance mutations in HBV obtained from 20 plasma samples from 11 NRTI-treated patients and 17 plasma samples from 17 NRTI-naive patients, by using standard direct PCR sequencing and ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS). UDPS detected drug-resistance mutations that were not detected by PCR in 10 samples from 5 NRTI-treated patients, including the lamivudine-resistance mutation V173L (in 5 samples), the entecavir-resistance mutations T184S (in 2 samples) and S202G (in 1 sample), the adefovir-resistance mutation N236T (in 1 sample), and the lamivudine and adefovir-resistance mutations V173L, L180M, A181T, and M204V (in 1 sample). G-to-A hypermutation mediated by the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like family of cytidine deaminases was estimated to be present in 0.6% of reverse-transcriptase genes. Genotype A coinfection was detected by UDPS in each of 3 patients in whom genotype G virus was detected by direct PCR sequencing. UDPS detected low-prevalence HBV variants with NRTI-resistance mutations, G-to-A hypermutation, and low-level dual genotype infection with a sensitivity not previously possible."
Doc No.612,7755,negative/unlabeled,8.831221,Prevalence and patient awareness of medical comorbidities in an urban AIDS clinic.,"Mortality in HIV-positive persons is increasingly due to non-HIV-related medical comorbidities. There are limited data on the prevalence and patient awareness of these comorbid conditions. Two hundred subjects at an urban HIV clinic were interviewed in 2005 to assess their awareness of 15 non-HIV-related medical comorbidities, defined as medical problems that are neither AIDS-defining by standard definitions, nor a direct effect of immune deficiency. Medical charts were subsequently reviewed to establish prevalence and concordance between self-report and chart documentation. Eighty-four percent of subjects self-reported at least 1 of 15 medical comorbidities and 92% had at least 1 condition chart-documented. The top 5 chart-documented conditions were hepatitis C (51.5%), pulmonary disease (28.5%), high blood pressure (27%), high cholesterol (24.5%), and obesity (22.5%). In multivariate analysis, higher number of non-HIV-related medical comorbidities was associated with older age, female gender, and intravenous drug use as route of HIV transmission. Across self-reported non-HIV-related medical comorbidities, the absolute concordance rate ranged from 67% to 96%, the sensitivity ranged from 0% to 79%; the positive predictive value ranged from 0% to 100%. While the vast majority of largely urban minority HIV-positive subjects were diagnosed with non-HIV-related medical comorbidities, there is significant room for improvement in patient awareness. In order to help patients optimally access and adhere to medication and medical care for these non-HIV-related medical comorbidities, interventions and educational campaigns to improve patient awareness that take cultural background, literacy, and educational level into account should be developed, implemented, and evaluated."

Nineteen patients remained consistently resistant or susceptible for more than 5 years of follow-up. On the fifth year, 5 consistently susceptible volunteers with high viral loads began receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). After >6 months on HAART, 5 of 5 became completely or predominantly resistant on four visits over the next 6 months. Among HIV-1-positive donors, we had never observed reversal of PBMC phenotype from consistently susceptible to consistently resistant. Resistance correlated with suppression of plasma viremia and rebound in CD4+ T-cell counts and percentages. When resistant PBMCs were challenged after CD8+ T-cell depletion, 38 of 41 and 40 of 59 cultures became susceptible to HIV-1MN and HIV-1BaL, respectively. After combined CD8+ T-cell depletion and antibody neutralization of beta-chemokines, 16 of 18 cultures became susceptible to HIV-1BaL. Overall, the finding that >90% of these cultures depleted of relevant antiviral effector arms could become infected indicates resistance was not due to residual antiretroviral drug metabolites in vitro. For 2 volunteers who discontinued therapy because of side effects, pretreatment viral load correlated with loss of in vitro resistance and viral rebound. In addition to resistance to laboratory strains of HIV-1, all patients developed resistance to at least one of two CCR5-tropic, clade B primary isolates: HIV-1P15 and HIV-1P27."

In the present article we have investigated whether changes in expression of other cell surface molecules could be related to HIV infection. To detect HIV-infected cells at the single-cell level, peripheral blood lymphocytes were infected in vitro with HIV-HSA, a reporter virus encoding the murine heat-stable antigen. Expression of HSA on activated primary lymphocytes was an efficient indicator of productive infection. Expression of the majority of the cell surface proteins studied was unaffected by HIV infection (HLA class I, II, CD11a, CD18, CD25, CD27, CD28, CD29, CD30, CD31, CD38, CD44, CD45R0, CD49d, CD57, CD94, CD95, and CXCR4). However, phenotypic changes specific to the productively infected cells were detected. Expression of the CD4 molecule was progressively lost and this was closely associated with loss of CD62L expression, a molecule involved in T cell homing into the lymph nodes. By contrast, T cells productively infected with this T-tropic reporter virus were enriched for CD54, and for CCR5, the main coreceptor for M-tropic viruses. Given the roles of CD62L, CD54, and CCR5 in lymphocyte trafficking, these results suggest that cells productively infected with HIV might have altered homing patterns in vivo."

The circulation of strains carrying mutations in the viral proteins implies both clinical and therapeutics challenges. HBV complete genomes (HBV-CGs) were reported from injecting drug users and HBV chronically infected patients from Argentina-including Amerindians-although no studies were conducted in blood donors. Here, we described HBV-CG sequences from the latter population. Some of the HBV sequences classified as B2 and C2 subgenotypes clustering together with Asian isolates, while others, such as D3, F1b, and F4, were homologous to European and Latin America sequences. New substitutions for all analyzed open reading frames and changes in the HBsAg hydrophobicity profiles were detected. Several HBV-CG subgenotypes are described for the first time in this population. Mutations observed in X, PreS, and P proteins have been associated with advanced liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or natural resistance to nucleos(t)ide antiviral treatment. It deserves to be highlighted that these substitutions were detected in a population without epidemiological risk factors for viral infection, and most importantly, without any previous antiviral treatment (natural resistance). Regarding the remaining mutations, further research is warranted in order to determine their clinical and therapeutics relevance."

Despite good effectiveness, this cytokine is associated with major side effects, including significant lymphopenia, that limits its use for HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Interleukin-7 (IL-7) has recently shown therapeutic potential and safety in several clinical trials designed to demonstrate T-cell restoration in immunodeficient patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus macaques, the relevance of IL-7 therapy as a means to overcoming IFN-α-induced lymphopenia. We showed that low-dose IFN-α treatment induced strong lymphopenia in chronically infected monkeys. In contrast, high-dose IFN-α treatment stimulated IL-7 production, leading to increased circulating T-cell counts. Moreover, IL-7 therapy more than abrogated the lymphopenic effect of low-dose IFN-α. Indeed, the association of both cytokines resulted in increased circulating T-cell counts, in particular in the naive compartments, as a consequence of central and peripheral homeostatic functions of the IL-7. Finally, reduced PD-1 expression by memory CD8(+) T cells and transient T-cell repertoire diversification were observed under IL-7 therapy. Our data strongly suggest that IL-7 immunotherapy will be of substantial benefit in the treatment of HIV/HCV coinfection and should enhance the likelihood of HCV eradication in poorly responding patients."

However, the role these important cell populations play in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis or adult T cell leukemia remains unresolved. To better understand how HTLV-1 infection of these important cell populations may potentially impact disease progression, the regulation of HTLV-1 viral gene expression in established monocytic cell lines was examined. U-937 promonocytic cells transiently transfected with a HTLV-1 long-terminal repeat (LTR) luciferase construct were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce cellular differentiation. PMA-induced cellular differentiation resulted in activation of basal and Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-1 LTR. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift analyses demonstrated that PMA-induced cellular differentiation induced DNA-binding activity of cellular transcription factors to Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1) repeat II. Supershift analyses revealed that factors belonging to the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family of basic region/leucine zipper proteins (Fra-1, Fra-2, JunB, and JunD) were induced to bind to TRE-1 repeat II during cellular differentiation. Inhibition of AP-1 DNA-binding activity by overexpression of a dominant-negative c-Fos mutant (A-Fos) in transient expression analyses resulted in severely decreased levels of HTLV-1 LTR activation in PMA-induced U-937 cells. These results have suggested that following infection of peripheral blood monocytes, HTLV-1 viral gene expression may become up-regulated by AP-1 during differentiation into macrophages or dendritic cells."
Doc No.618,4523,negative/unlabeled,8.812055,Concomitant augmentation of type 1 CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses during successful interferon-alpha and ribavirin treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus infection.,"The combined interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and ribavirin (IFN-alpha/ribavirin) therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection results in sustained viral eradication in 31%-64% of the patients. Previous studies have strongly suggested that HCV-specific T-cell responses maybe modulated during this therapy. The objective of this study was to further define the effect of IFN-alpha/ribavirin therapy on type 1 and type 2 HCV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses during IFN-alpha/ribavirin therapy. Toward this, serial CD8(+) T-cell responses to HCV-derived epitopes and CD4(+) T-cell responses to the HCV core antigen were analyzed in four patients before (baseline), during (at 24 weeks), and at the end (at 48 weeks) of IFN-alpha/ribavirin therapy. Therapy-induced viral clearance in three patients was associated with a significant augmentation of HCV-specific type 1 CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses. In contrast, in a patient who did not respond to therapy, a significant HCV-specific CD4(+) Th2 cell reactivity was observed accompanied by a lack of augmentation of the HCV-specific CD8(+) T-cell reactivity. These results indicate that enhancement of HCV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses is an important factor in determining the response to the IFN-alpha/ribavirin therapy and the outcome of the HCV infection."

Doc No.620,6649,negative/unlabeled,8.81049,Epidemiologic and molecular characterization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in southern Brazil.,"HIV subtype C is the most prevalent subtype in the world. Despite its recent expansion in Brazil, HIV-1C already prevails in the southernmost state of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul. This unique HIV epidemiology has prompted us to characterize that population. Seventy-seven HIV-1-infected subjects attending the largest HIV/AIDS clinic of the state had the protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes of their virus subtyped and genotyped. When subtype-specific infections were plotted according to year of diagnosis, the prevalence of subtype C was shown to increase over the last 18 years of the epidemic, along with a concomitant decrease of subtype B. Comparison of subtype C-infected treated and untreated subjects revealed amino acid differences in protease and RT, especially in the RT mutation D/G123S. The overall analysis of drug resistance mutations in viruses from treated subjects has highlighted some associations between subtypes and particular mutations, such as V82A/F/T/S in protease and subtype F1 and M41L and L210W in RT and subtype B. The characterization of this important population, which is one of a few in the developing world where a large number of HIV-1C-infected subjects are under antiretroviral treatment, underscores its potential usefulness in clinical, treatment, and vaccine trials in Brazil."

Understanding the genetic diversity of C viruses and the biological consequences of this diversity is important for the design of effective control strategies. We analyzed the protease gene, the first 935 nucleotides of reverse transcriptase, and the C2V5 envelope region of a representative set of 72 treatment-naïve patients from KwaZulu-Natal and correlated the results with amino acid signature and resistance patterns. Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple clusters or ""lineages"" of HIV-1 subtype C that segregated with other C viruses from southern Africa. The same pattern was observed for both black and Indian subgroups and for retrospective specimens collected prior to 1990, indicating that multiple sublineages of HIV-1 C have been present in KwaZulu-Natal since the early stages of the epidemic. With the exception of three nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations, no primary resistance mutations were identified. Numerous accessory polymorphisms were present in the protease, but none were located at drug-binding or active sites of the enzyme. One frequent polymorphism, I93L, was located near the protease/reverse transcriptase cleavage site. In the envelope, disruption of the glycosylation motif at the beginning of V3 was associated with the presence of an extra protein kinase C phosphorylation site at codon 11. Many polymorphisms were embedded within cytotoxic T lymphocyte or overlapping cytotoxic T-lymphocyte/T-helper epitopes, as defined for subtype B. This work forms a baseline for future studies aimed at understanding the impact of genetic diversity on vaccine efficacy and on natural susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs."

The assay uses relatively simple autologous cell culture and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, avoids generation of T cell clones, and can be performed with <2 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Efficient CD8 T cell-mediated cross-clade inhibition of HIV-1 replication in vitro was demonstrated in antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-1-infected subjects with controlled viral replication in vivo but not in viremic subjects. An HIV-1 vaccine candidate, consisting of DNA and recombinant adenovirus 5 vectors tested in a phase I clinical trial, induced CD8 T cells that efficiently inhibited HIV-1 in a HLA-I-dependent manner. Assessment of direct antiviral T cell function by this assay provides additional information to guide vaccine design and the prioritizing of candidates for further clinical trials."
Doc No.623,5926,negative/unlabeled,8.798124,Upregulation of the Tim-3/galectin-9 pathway of T cell exhaustion in chronic hepatitis B virus infection.,"The S-type lectin galectin-9 binds to the negative regulatory molecule Tim-3 on T cells and induces their apoptotic deletion or functional inactivation. We investigated whether galectin-9/Tim-3 interactions contribute to the deletion and exhaustion of the antiviral T cell response in chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB). We found Tim-3 to be expressed on a higher percentage of CD4 and CD8 T cells from patients with CHB than healthy controls (p<0.0001) and to be enriched on activated T cells and those infiltrating the HBV-infected liver. Direct ex vivo examination of virus-specific CD8 T cells binding HLA-A2/peptide multimers revealed that Tim-3 was more highly upregulated on HBV-specific CD8 T cells than CMV-specific CD8 T cells or the global CD8 T cell population in patients with CHB (p<0.001) or than on HBV-specific CD8 after resolution of infection. T cells expressing Tim-3 had an impaired ability to produce IFN-γ and TNF-α upon recognition of HBV-peptides and were susceptible to galectin-9-triggered cell death in vitro. Galectin-9 was detectable at increased concentrations in the sera of patients with active CHB-related liver inflammation (p = 0.02) and was strongly expressed by Kupffer cells within the liver sinusoidal network. Tim-3 blockade resulted in enhanced expansion of HBV-specific CD8 T cells able to produce cytokines and mediate cytotoxicity in vitro. Blocking PD-1 in combination with Tim-3 enhanced the number of patients from whom functional antiviral responses could be recovered and/or the strength of responses, indicating that these co-inhibitory molecules play a non-redundant role in driving T cell exhaustion in CHB. Patients taking antivirals able to potently suppress HBV viraemia continued to express Tim-3 on their T cells and respond to Tim-3 blockade. In summary, both Tim-3 and galectin-9 are increased in CHB and may contribute to the inhibition and deletion of T cells as they infiltrate the HBV-infected liver."

In the present study, the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the spontaneous apoptosis of distinct T cell subsets were investigated during a 6-month follow-up in a cohort of HIV-1-infected individuals with CD4(+) cell counts between 100 and 500 cells/microliter and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels >/=10, 000 copies/ml. We determined that the rapid and sustained increase of both naive (CD45RA(+)CD62L(+)) and memory (CD45R0(+) and CD45RA(+)/CD62L(-)) CD4(+) and, to as lesser extent, CD8(+) T cells in peripheral blood was associated with a significant decrease of apoptotic CD4(+) and CD8(+) as well as CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells. Among CD4(+) lymphocytes, at enrollment, the highest frequency of apoptotic cells was observed within the memory compartment, as defined by CD45R0 expression. During HAART, however, the frequency of CD4(+)CD45R0(+) apoptotic T cells progressively decreased in association with a significant downregulation of surface activation markers that indicated decreased levels of systemic immune stimulation. These results indicate that effective viral suppression can contribute to progressive normalization of maturational and functional T cell abnormalities responsible for the high levels of T cell apoptosis in HIV-1-infected individuals. This, in turn, may contribute to a reduced rate of T cell loss and immune reconstitution during HAART."

We used a mathematical model to estimate the long-term population-level benefits of ART and determine the scenarios under which earlier ART (treatment at 1 year post-infection, on average) could decrease simultaneously both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence (new infections). We constructed an infection-age-structured mathematical model that tracked the transmission rates over the course of infection and modelled the patients' life expectancy as a function of ART initiation timing. We fitted this model to the annual AIDS incidence and death data directly, and to resistance data and demographic data indirectly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco. Using counterfactual scenarios, we assessed the impact on total and drug-resistant HIV incidence of ART initiation timing, frequency of acquired drug resistance, and second-line drug effectiveness (defined as the combination of resistance monitoring, biomedical drug efficacy and adherence). Earlier ART initiation could decrease the number of both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence when second-line drug effectiveness is sufficiently high (greater than 80%), but increase the proportion of new infections that are drug resistant. Thus, resistance may paradoxically appear to be increasing while actually decreasing."

(Pathway and Education Toward Adherence and Completion in Hepatitis C Therapy): A Nurse-Driven Evidence-Based Protocol.,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a major healthcare concern. The 24-48 week treatment of pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy requires a tremendous amount of commitment from patients and providers. Thus, there has been a huge focus on health-related quality of life and various measures to support patient adherence and completion of the recommended HCV treatment regimen. This quality improvement project aimed to develop and test a nurse-driven evidence-based pathway that supports the care of patients receiving hepatitis C medication therapy in a tertiary, academic hepatology practice. All adult patients, 18 years and older, who were started on HCV treatment from January 20 to February 15, 2011, were included in the testing of a nurse-driven HCV pathway for the first 12 weeks of treatment. The majority of the patients treated were male (71.8% prepathway and 83.3% postpathway), of White ethnic background (61.5% prepathway and 58.3% postpathway), genotype 1 (69% prepathway and 91.7% postpathway), and had comorbid conditions classified as ""other"" (38.5% prepathway and 33.3% postpathway). As for treatment status, the majority of the patients were ""treatment naive"" in prepathway or had never received prior HCV treatment (59.0%) or ""had recurrent HCV after liver transplantation"" (41.7%). The 4-week treatment completion rate was 94.9% for the prepathway group and 100.0% for the postpathway group; 12-week completion rate was 87.2% (prepathway) and 58.3% for the postpathway group. The mean 4-week adherence score for the prepathway group was 2.46 and the postpathway group was 2.92. Mean lag time to treatment was decreased with 26 days in the postpathway and 43 in the prepathway. Providers and nurses expressed overall satisfaction with the nurse-driven pathway. "

Of 84 HIV-1-infected individuals treated with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 43 (51.2%) have been found to carry amino acid substitutions predicted to acquire drug-resistances. One to 3 mutations at amino acid residues reported to be associated with protease inhibitor-resistance were detected in more than 80% of protease inhibitor-naive patients. However, these pre-existing mutations did not seem to raise a real resistance after the initiation of therapy with protease inhibitors. Phenotypic resistance assay was performed with 6 clinical isolates to compare with genotypic resistance. In most of the cases, phenotype was correlated with genotypic changes, however, two strains which were isolated from patients having no experience of chemotherapy showed a decrease in susceptibility to several drugs without any resistance-related mutations detected in their genes. Taken together, determination of phenotypic resistance is necessary, especially when a newly-infected patients starts antiviral therapy."

Here, we investigated cell proliferation, as measured by expression of the Ki-67 nuclear antigen, in peripheral blood CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocyte subpopulations before and during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In untreated HIV-1 infection, both the percentage and number of Ki-67(+) CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes were significantly increased, compared with values obtained from healthy individuals. A more than 10-fold increase in the percentage of dividing naive CD4(+) T cells in the blood was found when the number of these cells were below 100 per microL. HAART induced an immediate decline in Ki-67 antigen expression, despite often very low CD4(+) T-cell numbers, arguing against increased proliferation being a homeostatic response. After approximately 24 weeks of HAART treatment, a transient increase in the number of proliferating cells was seen, but only in the CD4(+) CD27(+) memory pool. In the CD8(+) T-cell compartment, the number of dividing cells was elevated 20- to 25-fold. This increase was most notable in the CD27(+) CD 45RO(+) and CD27(-) CD45RO(+) memory CD8(+) T-cell pool, corresponding with the degree of expansion of these subsets. Reduction of plasma HIV-RNA load by HAART was accompanied by a decrease in numbers and percentages of dividing cells in all CD8(+) T-cell subsets. Taken together, our results indicate that peripheral T-cell proliferation is a consequence of generalized immune activation. (Blood. 2000;95:249-255)"
Doc No.629,3662,positive/labeled,8.770703,Lymphoid tissue damage in HIV-1 infection depletes naïve T cells and limits T cell reconstitution after antiretroviral therapy.,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can suppress HIV-1 replication and normalize the chronic immune activation associated with infection, but restoration of naïve CD4+ T cell populations is slow and usually incomplete for reasons that have yet to be determined. We tested the hypothesis that damage to the lymphoid tissue (LT) fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network contributes to naïve T cell loss in HIV-1 infection by restricting access to critical factors required for T cell survival. We show that collagen deposition and progressive loss of the FRC network in LTs prior to treatment restrict both access to and a major source of the survival factor interleukin-7 (IL-7). As a consequence, apoptosis within naïve T cell populations increases significantly, resulting in progressive depletion of both naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. We further show that the extent of loss of the FRC network and collagen deposition predict the extent of restoration of the naïve T cell population after 6 month of HAART, and that restoration of FRC networks correlates with the stage of disease at which the therapy is initiated. Because restoration of the FRC network and reconstitution of naïve T cell populations are only optimal when therapy is initiated in the early/acute stage of infection, our findings strongly suggest that HAART should be initiated as soon as possible. Moreover, our findings also point to the potential use of adjunctive anti-fibrotic therapies to avert or moderate the pathological consequences of LT fibrosis, thereby improving immune reconstitution."
Doc No.630,4636,negative/unlabeled,8.768998,Association between HLA variations and chronic hepatitis B virus infection in Saudi Arabian patients.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading cause of liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) play an important role in the regulation of immune response against infectious organisms, including HBV. Recently, several genome-wide association (GWAS) studies have shown that genetic variations in HLA genes influence disease progression in HBV infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of HLA genetic polymorphisms and their possible role in HBV infection in Saudi Arabian patients. Variations in HLA genes were screened in 1672 subjects who were divided according to their clinical status into six categories as follows; clearance group, inactive carriers, active carriers, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and uninfected healthy controls. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belonged to HLA-DQ region (rs2856718, rs7453920 and rs9275572) and two SNPs belonged to HLA-DP (rs3077 and rs9277535) were studied. The SNPs were genotyped by PCR-based DNA sequencing (rs2856718) and allele specific TaqMan genotyping assays (rs3077, rs7453920, rs9277535 and rs9275572). The results showed that rs2856718, rs3077, rs9277535 and rs9275572 were associated with HBV infection (p = 0.0003, OR = 1.351, CI = 1.147-1.591; p = 0.041, OR = 1.20, CI = 1.007-1.43; p = 0.045, OR = 1.198, CI = 1.004-1.43 and p = 0.0018, OR = 0.776, CI = 0.662-0.910, respectively). However, allele frequency of rs2856718, rs7453920 and rs9275572 were found more in chronically infected patients when compared to clearance group infection (p = 0.0001, OR = 1.462, CI = 1.204-1.776; p = 0.0178, OR = 1.267, CI = 1.042-1.540 and p = 0.010, OR = 0.776, CI = 0.639-0.942, respectively). No association was found when polymorphisms in HLA genes were compared in active carriers versus cirrhosis/HCC patients. In conclusion, these results suggest that variations in HLA genes could affect susceptibility to and clearance of HBV infection in Saudi Arabian patients. "
Doc No.631,9358,negative/unlabeled,8.76835,Regulation of expression driven by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and human T-cell leukemia virus type I long terminal repeats in pluripotential human embryonic cells.,"Human pluripotential embryonic teratocarcinoma cells differentially expressed gene activity controlled by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) long terminal repeats (LTRs) when differentiation was induced by the morphogen all-trans retinoic acid. The alterations occurred after commitment and before the appearance of the multiple cell types characteristic of these pluripotential cells. After commitment, gene activity controlled by the HIV-1 LTR markedly increased, whereas that controlled by the HTLV-I LTR decreased. Steady-state mRNA levels and nuclear run-on transcription indicated that the increased HIV-1-directed activity during differentiation occurred posttranscriptionally, whereas the decreased HTLV-I activity was at the transcriptional level. Phorbol esters did not cause commitment but strongly enhanced expression by both viral LTRs at the transcriptional level. A specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, indicated that the enhanced activity involved the activation of protein kinase(s) C; altered cyclic nucleotide metabolism was apparently not involved. Differentiating cells gradually lost the ability to respond to phorbol ester stimulation. Experiments with a deletion mutant of the HIV-1 LTR suggested that this was due to imposition of negative regulation during differentiation that was not reversed by phorbol ester induction. Cycloheximide, with or without phorbol ester, slightly stimulated HIV-1-directed activity at the transcriptional level and massively increased the amounts of steady-state mRNA by posttranscriptional superinduction. It appeared, however, that new nuclear protein synthesis was required for maximal transcriptional stimulation by phorbol esters. Thus, changing cellular regulatory mechanisms influenced human retrovirus expression during human embryonic cell differentiation."

Mean steady state serum concentrations of foscarnet was 261 mumol/l. Treatment was given for 6-21 days, median 14 days, being interrupted prematurely due to renal function impairment in seven patients, and due to other reasons in three patients. Foscarnet therapy was accompanied by improvement of some, probably cytomegalovirus (CMV) related, symptoms but did not otherwise affect the clinical condition of the patients. The occurrence of positive CMV cultures decreased significantly during therapy. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) detection by culture was positive in 70-80% of cultures and was unaffected by foscarnet treatment. Eight patients had detectable, free HIV antigen in serum before therapy, and in five of these HIV antigen disappeared during therapy, but reappeared 4-23 weeks after therapy. No patient lost HIV antigen, except during foscarnet therapy. No patient became HIV antigen positive during foscarnet therapy. Immunological parameters did not change during or after foscarnet therapy. Renal function impairment was seen in 9 patients (95% confidence limits, 32-84%), apparently due to reversible tubular damage. At follow-up, serum creatine was normal in all surviving patients. Concomitant medication may have contributed to the renal side-effects. Severe renal function impairment, i.e. serum creatinine above 0.25 mumol/l, was only seen in patients who at the start of foscarnet therapy were chronically affected by their disease. Thus, foscarnet reduces HIV antigen production in AIDS patients. Renal function impairment limits foscarnet use in AIDS patients, but in individuals with less severe manifestations of HIV infection, this side effect may be less frequent."

At 6 days, no residual human cells were detected in mouse tissues as determined by PCR analysis of DNAs from injected mice using primers and probes for the human HLA-DQ alpha gene. At 6 to 12 months, approximately 60% of the HIV-1-infected mice had antibodies to HIV-1 gp 120 and gp41 proteins. Fifteen percent of the animals showed evidence of HIV-1 infection as determined by PCR analyses of DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes and by in situ hybridization for detection of HIV-1 mRNA in peritoneal cells. In this set of experiments, spleen cells from mice sacrificed at different times after injection were cultured for 48 h in the presence or absence of mitogens [i.e.: concanavalin (Con A) or anti-CD3 antibody] and then tested for lymphocyte proliferation. At 10 to 12 months, splenocytes from approximately 80% of Swiss mice injected with HIV-1-infected U937 cells exhibited a marked defect in their proliferative response to Con A or anti-CD3 antibody as compared with spleen cells from both uninjected or U937 cell-injected mice. Similar results were obtained at 12 months in C3H/HeJ mice. Non-responding spleen cells from HIV-1-injected Swiss mice did not proliferate in response to anti-CD3 antibody even in the presence of co-stimulatory molecules such as phorbol myristate acetate or anti-CD28 antibody. Splenocytes from these mice also exhibited an impaired capacity to produce interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 after mitogen stimulation. No T cell defects were observed in control-injected mice. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed a significant decrease in the percentage of both CD4+ and CD8+ spleen cells in HIV-1-injected mice. These data indicate that immunocompetent mice can be used to investigate some HIV-1-related immune dysfunctions in vivo."

Most factors that are known to activate HIV-1 gene expression increase the binding of NF-kappa B or NF-kappa B-like transcription factors to the HIV-1 core enhancer region. In this report, we demonstrate that retinoic acid (RA) treatment of promonocytic U937 cells stimulates expression from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) long terminal repeat (LTR). Furthermore, RA and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) synergistically stimulated both SIVmac and HIV-1 LTRs to levels of expression comparable to that achieved by the viral transactivator Tat. The cis-acting elements required for a response to RA and PMA cotreatment are located between nucleotides -50 and +1 of SIVmac and between nucleotides -83 and +80 of HIV-1. Thus, the synergistic stimulation induced by RA and PMA is NF-kappa B independent. Analysis of deletion mutants of the SIVmac LTR demonstrates that RA and PMA stimulation cooperates with NF-kappa B and Sp1. An SIVmac LTR-reporter gene construct [pLTR(-50/+466)CAT] lacking NF-kappa B and Sp1 binding sites was not activated by Tat in untreated cells but was activated in cells that were cotreated with RA and PMA. Furthermore, gel retardation assays demonstrated that RA treatment causes a change in the pattern of a cellular factor(s) which binds to the -50 through +1 region of the SIVmac LTR. These data suggest that RA induces a PMA-activatable cellular factor that cooperates with NF-kappa B, Sp1, or Tat to stimulate LTR-directed transcription."

Emerging data indicate that alternate reading frames (ARFs) of both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) encode CD8+ T cell epitopes, termed cryptic epitopes. Here, we show that SIV-specific CD8+ T cells from SIV-infected rhesus macaques target 14 epitopes in eight ARFs during SIV infection. Animals recognized up to five epitopes, totaling nearly one-quarter of the anti-SIV responses. The epitopes were targeted by high-frequency responses as early as 2 weeks postinfection and in the chronic phase. Hence, previously overlooked ARF-encoded epitopes could be important components of AIDS vaccines."

Because CTLs have not been identified in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) brains, the authors identified their cytotoxic granules in autopsy AIDS brains with HIVE and without HIVE (HIVnE) plus controls (7 to 13 cases/group) and determined gene expression profiles of CTL-associated genes in a separate series of cases. CD3+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly increased (P < .01) in perivascular spaces and inflammatory nodules in HIVE but were rare or absent in brain parenchyma in HIVnE and control brains. Eight HIVE brains contained granzyme B+ T cells and five contained perforin+ T cells. Their T-cell origin was confirmed by colocalization of CD8 and granzyme B in the same cell and the absence of CD56+ natural killer cells. The CTLs directly contacted with neurons, as the authors showed previously for CD3+ and CD8+ T cells. CTLs were rare or absent in HIV nonencephalitis (HIVnE) and controls. Granzyme B and H precursor gene expression was up-regulated and interleukin (IL)-12A precursor, a maturation factor for natural killer cells and CTLs, was down-regulated in HIVE versus HIVnE brain. This study demonstrates, for the first time, CTLs in HIVE and shows that parenchymal T cells and CTLs are sensitive biomarkers for HIVE. Consequently, CD8+ T cells and CTLs could mediate brain injury in HIVE and may represent an important biomarker for productive brain infection by HIV-1."

We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to null virological response (NVR) in the treatment of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 within a Japanese population. We found two SNPs near the gene IL28B on chromosome 19 to be strongly associated with NVR (rs12980275, P = 1.93 x 10(-13), and rs8099917, 3.11 x 10(-15)).

Doc No.638,270,positive/labeled,8.737156,Early T-cell apoptosis and Fas expression during antiretroviral therapy in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1.,"Several lines of evidence suggest that Fas-mediated apoptosis is involved in the CD4 T-cell depletion in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. To investigate this, we studied changes in peripheral blood, early T-cell apoptosis and Fas expression after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 18 HIV-1-infected individuals. Flow cytometric analysis was performed with Apostain and CD4, CD8 and Fas staining. Fas expression was quantified by standardized beads. The levels of CD4 and CD8 T cells with early apoptosis were increased comparably in HIV-1-infected individuals. Despite elevated CD4 T cell counts, no decline in early T-cell apoptosis could be detected during the first 8 weeks of ART. However, after 26 weeks of ART in five patients that showed a sustained reduction of viral replication there was a marked decrease in T cells with features of early apoptosis. No difference was found for Fas expression on early apoptotic T cells. Fas expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells was reduced after initiation of ART; this was independent of the CD4 T-cell trend and indicates that the immediate CD4 T-cell expansion during ART is probably not the result of a decreased rate of early apoptosis among peripheral blood CD4 T cells. However, preliminary data imply a long-term reduction of early T-cell apoptosis and Fas expression in patients who show a sustained reduction of viral replication."

Doc No.640,8628,negative/unlabeled,8.73469,"The case for more cautious, patient-focused antiretroviral therapy.","Many clinicians who care for patients with HIV infection are dissatisfied with the existing recommendations on antiretroviral therapy. Current practice focuses on the early suppression of viremia, yet the outcome of that approach may not be in the best interest of individual patients or populations. The major goal of HIV therapy is to maintain the long-term health of the patient while avoiding drug-related toxicity and preserving viable future treatment options. Recent studies have challenged the principles on which recommendations for early, aggressive treatment were based. Key studies that lead to licensure of antiretroviral medications usually involve short-term results in treatment-naive patients; it is difficult to apply these results to long-term management of therapy-experienced patients. Early, aggressive therapy often prematurely exposes patients to risks for medication-related side effects and resistance. A more cautious, patient-focused, long-term approach to therapy would help foster studies of alternate strategies, such as delayed initiation of therapy, protease-sparing therapy, class-sparing therapy, planned drug interruptions, switches in therapy, and immune-based therapy. It is time for clinicians to rethink their approach to the treatment of HIV infection."

The CNS is an immunological privileged site providing a sanctuary and reservoir for HIV-1. Monocytes derived macrophages (MDM) and microglia play a critical role in the development of HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Although the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a strong reduction of HAD incidence, the prevalence of minor HIV-1 associated cognitive impairment appears rising among AIDS patients. Various factors including toxicity, insurgence of drug resistance and sometimes limited access to HAART, contribute to this phenomenon. Independent evolution of drug resistance mutations in several areas of the CNS may emerge as consequence of incomplete suppression of HIV-1, probably related to poor penetration of antiretroviral drugs into CNS. The emergence of resistant virus in the CNS may considerable influence the outcome of neurological disease and also the reseeding of HIV-1 in the systemic circulation upon failure of therapy. In this review, we outline the current state of knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of CNS injury in HIV-1 infection and will focus on the effects of HAART on CNS."

In the study, women with baseline CD4(+) <350/mm(3) received a combination of stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine during pregnancy (from week 25 of gestation) and continued it indefinitely after delivery. HIV-RNA was measured at 12 and 24 months postpartum. Drug resistance mutations were assessed in those with HIV-RNA >50 copies/ml. Baseline resistance mutations were assessed in the entire cohort. A total of 107 women were studied. At baseline, resistance mutations were seen in 6.6% of the women. At 12 months, 26.7% of the women had >50 copies/ml and among them 12.9% had virological failure (HIV-RNA >1,000 copies/ml). At 24 months, detectable HIV-RNA was seen in 28.3% of the women and virological failure in 10.1% of the women. Resistance mutations (mainly non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors mutations) were seen in 40% of the women with detectable HIV-RNA. Baseline mutations did not correlate with virological failure or the emergence of resistance at later time points. Virological failure 2 years postpartum and emergence of resistance were rare in this cohort of HIV-infected women. These findings are reassuring in the light of the new strategies for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, recommending life-long antiretroviral therapy administration."

Since September 1993, CDC has received reports from health-care providers and public health departments in two U.S. cities regarding improper infection-control practices during vaccination of employees at worksite vaccination programs. These practices could potentially have exposed vaccine recipients to infectious agents. This report summarizes the preliminary findings of an ongoing investigation of these reports."

However, it is unclear whether these changes result from decreased viremia or they correspond to true functional recovery of viral-specific immune response. To study this issue, we analysed the quantitative and qualitative differences of HIV-1-specific and polyclonal CD4+ and CD8+ T cells between 26 naive and 52 treated individuals. HIV-1 Gag and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-reactive T cells were determined by flowcytometric intracellular secretion of IFN-γ or/and ΙL-2. ART resulted in increase of single IL-2 and decrease of single IFN-γ-secreting HIV-1 CD4+ T cells, while both cytokines secreting HIV-1 CD4+ T cells were presented in comparable frequencies in both groups. Viral loads correlated negatively with single IL-2 and positively with single IFN-γ-secreting HIV-1 CD4+ cells. Single IL-2 HIV-1 CD4+ T cells correlated positively with both cytokines secreting polyclonal CD8+ T cells. By qualitative analysis, a dominant IL-2 HIV-1 CD4+ T cell response (> 70% single IL-2) was identified only in ART suppressed patients, who also generated increased dual specific polyclonal CD8+ T cells. Polyfunctional HIV-1 CD4+ T cell responses were detected even in naive individuals with high viremia. In conclusion, the presence of dominant IL-2 HIV-1 CD4+ T cell response, associated with increased CD8+ T cells capable to produce IL-2, indicates that the recovery of HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cell functionality under ART is a feasible goal. Furthermore, polyfunctional HIV-1 CD4+ T cell responses seem not to be directly involved in viral replication control."

Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is therefore monitored closely, but follow-up studies of these patients are limited. Virus from 1405 individuals diagnosed with HIV-1 in Denmark between 2001 and 2009 was analyzed for TDR, and molecular-epidemiological links and progression of the infection were described based on data from standardized questionnaires, the prospective Danish HIV Cohort Study, and by phylogenetic analysis. Eighty-five individuals were found to be infected with virus harboring mutations resulting in a prevalence of 6.1%, with no changes over time. The main resistance mutations were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation 215 revertants, as well as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation 103N/S and protease inhibitor (PI) mutations 90M and 85V. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed 12 transmission chains involving 37 TDR individuals. Of these 21 were also documented epidemiologically. The virus included in the transmission chain carried similar resistance mutations to the TDR index case, whereas controls chains from index cases without TDR were generally without resistance mutations. We observed no difference in progression of the infection between individuals infected with TDR and individuals infected with wild-type HIV-1. The prevalence of TDR is low in Denmark and transmission of dual-drug-resistant HIV-1 is infrequent. The TDR isolates were shown to originate from local patients failing therapy."

This study describes the HIV-1 env gp41 region mutations, associated with enfuvirtide (ENF) resistance, in proviral DNA from PBMCs in antiretroviral treatment-naive individuals from Pune, India. Twenty-one antiretroviral drug-naive chronically HIV-1-infected individuals were enrolled. The study sequences belonged to subtype C (n = 17), subtype A1 (n = 2), and CRF_AE (n = 2). In subtype B-infected individuals, the various HR1 region substitutions in env gp41 that have been associated with ENF resistance include A30V, L33S/T/V, L34M, G36D/E/S/V, I37T/K/V, V38A/M/E/G, Q39R, Q40H, N42T/D, N43D/K/S, L44M, L45M, R46M, L54M, and Q56K/R as well as N126K and S138A in the HR2 region. The study sequences did not reveal any ENF resistance-associated mutations at env gp41 amino acid positions: 36 to 45. The presence of L54M and Q56K in combination is associated with 5-fold reduced sensitivity to inhibition by ENF. The mutation L54M was seen in seven subtype C and two CRF_AE study sequences. Q56K was observed in a subtype A1 sequence. All the study sequences harbored N42S, a natural polymorphism associated with increased susceptibility to ENF. Of the mutations V38A and N140I, known to provide immunologic gain, the latter was observed in four subtype C sequences. This is the first study from India highlighting the presence of certain mutations in Indian subtype C env gp41, which may play a role in the evolution of subtype-specific variations in the resistance to ENF and associated immune response."

We have characterized the coincident changes in PBL and lymph nodes (LN)1 after simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac) infection of rhesus monkeys. Whereas no consistent change in CD8+ PBL was noted during the first 60 d after infection, CD8+ lymphocytes increased significantly in number in LN. These CD8+ LN lymphocytes exhibited an increased expression of MHC class II and a decreased expression of leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, suggesting that they were activated, but interestingly did not express CD25 (IL-2 receptor). Moreover, there was no evidence that these CD8+ LN cells were proliferating, suggesting that they had migrated to the LN. These changes in the LN CD8+ lymphocyte population preceded any detectable change in the light microscopic appearance of the LN. When SIVmac-specific effector T cell responses were assessed, the magnitude of virus-specific effector activity was nearly identical in the PBL and LN of each monkey studied. However, the presence of SIVmac-specific effector cells in the LN did not correlate with the presence of CD8+, MHC class II+ cells. These findings suggest that this numerically important CD8+ lymphocyte subpopulation may serve a regulatory function."
Doc No.648,4042,positive/labeled,8.697496,Activation and cell cycle antigens in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells correlate with plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) RNA level in HIV-1 infection.,"The relationship between T cell activation and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication was studied in HIV-infected subjects, 20 with and 10 without anti-HIV treatment. Expression of Ki-67 proliferation-associated antigen was increased in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and correlated with HLA-DR. In subjects without anti-HIV treatment, the plasma HIV-1 RNA level correlated with HLA-DR in CD4+ T cells, with Ki-67 in CD8+ T cells, and with expression of CD38 in both T cell subsets. A proportion of treated subjects had increased T cell activation despite 4 months of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). In subjects receiving HAART, a high percentage of HLA-DR+ CD4+ T cells was associated with signs of opportunistic infections. This work supports the concept that, in the natural course of HIV-1 infection, HIV replication itself leads to general T cell activation and that opportunistic infections generate additional CD4+ T cell activation and HIV replication."

We report that the megakaryocytic cell line Dami could be productively infected with the HTLV III-B strain of HIV-1, in 26 different experiments (results of 16 experiments are reported); productive infection lasted up to 30 weeks. Despite a lack of detectable surface expression of the CD4 molecule and very low levels of CD4 mRNA, between 40% and 60% of megakaryocytic cells produced viral proteins after contact with HIV-1. Neither cytopathogenic effects nor syncytial formation was observed. Production of high levels of functional viral particles was indicated by analysis of p24 protein levels, reverse transcriptase activity, ultrastructural studies, and the capacity of supernatants from infected Dami cells to infect the Molt-4 T-lymphocytic cell line. HIV-1 RNA and protein levels in infected Dami cells were enhanced by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and decreased by treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-gamma. Transient transfection of the megakaryocytic cells with various constructs of the HIV-1 promoter (LTR) linked to the luciferase reporter gene suggested that the effect of TNF-alpha was related, as in monocytic and T-cell lines, to transactivation of the enhancer region of the HIV-1 LTR. These findings indicate that signals provided by the immune system may modulate HIV-1 expression in cells of the megakaryocytic lineage."

The D(d)-binding variants of the S(201-209) epitope showed different immunogenicity. The loss of the consensus C-terminal (P9) anchor abrogated its immunogenicity. In contrast, a conservative (serine vs asparagine) exchange at P7 primed cross-reactive CD8 T cells that preferentially recognized the priming variant. Cross-reactive CD8 T cell responses to a variant could be primed in mice tolerant to an alternative variant of the D(d)-binding S(201-209) peptide. Loss of the C-terminal (P10) anchor in S(185-194) eliminated its immunogenicity in HLA-A*0201(A2)-transgenic mice but two conservative exchanges (leucine vs valine in P2, and leucine vs isoleucine in P6) in S(208-216) generated cross-reactive CD8 T cell responses with strong preference for the priming variant. Similar cross-reactive recognition of variant envelope epitopes were also found in S(208-216)-specific CD8 T cells from hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients. Distinct CD8 T cell populations cross-reactive to natural variants of class I-restricted HBV epitopes can be primed by vaccination (of mice) or natural infection (of humans), and they may play a role in the ""spontaneous remission"" or the specific immunotherapy of chronic HBV infection."

The HIV-seropositive individuals were also classified clinically according to the system recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the CDC classification was correlated with the patients' T cell subset counts. Compared to the control group, the HIV-infected individuals demonstrated an early and sustained increase in the number of CD8+ T cells with median values of CDC groups II, III, and IV C2 twice that observed in the control group. Patients with AIDS had CD8+ T cell counts comparable to those of the control group. The HIV-infected individuals showed a decrease in the number of CD4+ T cells correlating with clinical deterioration of the disease. T cell subset counts significantly distinguished the group of healthy seropositive individuals from those with HIV-related disease, and the group of patients with AIDS from those with other HIV-related opportunistic infections."

To identify a cis-acting regulatory sequence within the HIV-1 LTR which is responsive to the HBV X-gene trans-activating function, we examined the effects of HBV X-gene expression in cells with a series of LTR/CAT deletion mutants. A region of the HIV-1 LTR containing the previously identified kappa B-like enhancer element was found to be responsive to HBV X-gene activation, and this effect was independent of, and additive with, the effect of the HIV-1 tat-III protein on CAT expression. Since kappa B-like enhancer sequences are known to regulate transcription of a variety of viruses and cellular genes, our results suggest that the X gene could activate such a gene during HBV infection and replication."
Doc No.653,4189,negative/unlabeled,8.679807,[Role of fixed-dose combinations of antiretrovirals in HIV-1 therapy].,"The launch of generic forms of some of the drugs included in fixed-dose combinations of antiretrovirals (FDCA) raises the potential risk of breaking these combinations in order to allow the administration of the new cheaper generic drug. This could result in a step back in some major advances achieved in simplicity and treatment adherence, resulting in an increased risk of selective treatment withdrawal of some of the drugs administered separately. Due to the mechanism of action of the currently available antiretroviral treatment administration must be life-long in infected individuals, both children and adults. FDCA are a significant advance in antiretroviral treatment simplification, contributing to increase compliance of complex chronic therapies, thus increasing the patient's quality of life. They reduce the risk of treatment errors and can also reduce the possibility of unprescribed monotherapy with selective non-compliance. Hence, they contribute to reduce the risk of selection of HIV-1 clones with antiretroviral resistance, a situation that not only compromises future treatment options of the infected individual, but can also be transmitted and are a situation of Public Health concern. Excluding those cases that require a particular dose adjustment, FDCA are a preferred treatment option and their use must be strongly recommended in all scenarios where the components included in the combination are preferred drugs."
Doc No.654,5234,positive/labeled,8.674979,Association between adherence to antiretroviral therapy and human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance.,"Nonadherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is a major cause of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance; however the level of nonadherence associated with the greatest risk of resistance is unknown. Beginning in February 2000, 195 patients at the Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center (Baltimore, MD) who were receiving HAART and who had HIV loads of <500 copies/mL were recruited into a cohort study and observed for 1 year. At each visit, adherence to HAART was assessed and plasma samples were obtained and stored for resistance testing, if indicated. The overall incidence of viral rebound with clinically significant resistance was 14.5 cases per 100 person-years. By multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, a cumulative adherence of 70%-89%, a CD4 cell nadir of <200 cells/microL, and the missing of a scheduled clinic visit in the past month were independently associated with an increased hazard of viral rebound with clinically significant resistance. Clinicians and patients must set high adherence goals to avoid the development of resistance."

TRECs were measured in purified CD4 and CD8 T cells of a large cohort of HIV-1-infected subjects (n = 297) with chronic infection but no previous antiretroviral treatment and of a control group of HIV-negative subjects (n = 120). HIV-1-infected subjects were stratified on the basis of CD4 T-cell counts in 3 groups, early-stage disease (more than 500 CD4 T cells), intermediate-stage disease (200-500 CD4 T cells), and late-stage disease (fewer than 200 CD4 T cells). Compared with the control group, CD8 TREC contents were severely reduced (P <.001) in HIV-1-infected subjects regardless of the stage of HIV disease. In contrast, CD4 TREC contents were significantly increased (P =.003) in HIV-1-infected subjects during early-stage disease, similar at intermediate-stage disease, and severely reduced only at late-stage disease. We show that the increase in CD4 TRECs was mostly limited to younger (younger than 45 years) patients at early-stage disease. Our results demonstrate a dichotomy between TREC contents in CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations in HIV-1 infection and indicate that thymus function in younger subjects is preserved at early and intermediate stages of HIV infection."

Associations between genetic polymorphisms and toxicity, C(trough) and response to nevirapine were performed in a population of 72 HIV-1 positive and nevirapine-treated patients followed during 72 weeks, as part of the previous study called: ANRS081 'Trianon' trial. Among the 18 patients who developed toxicity events during the 72 weeks of the study, 12 patients exhibited early toxicity before week 8. No significant association could be evidenced between any of the analysed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and nevirapine early or global toxicity, pharmacokinetics and immuno-virological responses even though a possible association between CYP2B6 516G>T and 1459C>T and the trough level of nevirapine was suggested."

Expression of CCR5 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes was reduced after 7 days and remained low throughout the culture. CXCR4 levels remained stable in both lymphocyte subpopulations. No significant changes were observed in control HIV- PBMC cultures. In order to ascertain if the CCR5 changes were associated to in vitro HIV replication, 6 days pre-cultured HIV- PBMC were infected with HIV+ culture supernatants. After 3 days CCR5 expression was reduced both in CD4+ and in CD8+ T lymphocytes, while CXCR4 expression was not, coincident with initiation of HIV replication in culture. These results suggest that CCR5 down modulation in CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes is a consequence of HIV replication."

To investigate the associations of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10204525, rs2227982 and rs36084323) in PD-1 and a previously well-inquired SNP rs12979860 in IL-28B with the outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Southeast China, a total of 375 healthy controls, 219 spontaneous resolved HCV patients and 600 chronic HCV patients were enrolled in this study. The generation of HCV F protein and PD-1 expression on T cells was determined. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed no association of rs12979860 CC genotype with spontaneous clearance of HCV infection in our subjects. The generation of HCV F protein was significantly related to HCV infection chronicity, but no significant relationship was found between HCV F protein and SNPs in PD-1. The rs10204525 TT genotype was associated with an increased risk of HCV infection chronicity in age ⩽56years subgroup (adjusted OR=0.390, P=3.8×10(-4)). The C allele of rs10204525 played protective roles in females infected with HCV (adjusted OR=0.608, P=0.008). A significant higher percentage of PD-1 expression on T cells was observed in rs10204525 TT genotype when compared to CC genotype (P=0.047). Moreover, a significant genotype-genotype interaction between IL-28B rs12979860 CC and PD-1 rs10204525 TC+CC was found to be associated with higher rates of spontaneous clearance (adjusted OR=0.689, P=0.032). The combined effect of rs12979860 and rs10204525 was of great value in predicting the outcomes of HCV infection. These analyses showed the importance of IL-28B and PD-1 polymorphisms and their interactions in the outcomes of HCV infection in Chinese Han population in Southeast China."

The predominance of subtype C in the Indian subcontinent along with greater access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) necessitates studies on HIVDR genotyping. We determined the prevalence of mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) from plasma of 40 antiretroviral drug-naive study participants in Indian HIV-1 pol gene sequences. Of these, 36 sequences belonged to subtype C, two to subtype A1, and two were subtype A1C recombinants. The heterosexual route was the most common route of transmission. Drug resistance-associated mutations were observed in 10% (4/40) of the study participants. The resistance mutation observed in the protease gene was V82A, whereas in the RT gene, M41L, D67N, M184V, and A98G were documented. This is the first study reporting major protease mutations by genotyping in ART-naive individuals from western India."

PG and clonal analysis (CA) results were compared in virologic failures (VFs) from a 48-week clinical trial that evaluated once-daily fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/r) 1400 mg/100 mg or atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) 300 mg/100 mg, each combined with tenofovir/emtricitabine, in antiretroviral-naive patients. VF was defined as confirmed HIV-1 RNA > or =400 copies/ml at > or =24 weeks or viral rebound >400 copies/ml any time following viral suppression. All patients had baseline PG. One hundred and six patients enrolled (53/arm). Baseline resistance mutations were more prevalent in patients receiving FPV/r (10/53) than ATV/r (3/53). Seven patients (7%) were VFs-four on FPV/r and three on ATV/r. In the four FPV/r-treated VFs, baseline HIV TAMs combinations and/or PI mutations were detected in one by PG at VF (RT: L210W + T215C; PR: M46I + L76V) and three others by CA alone (RT: L210W + T215Y; RT: M41L; RT: K65R + K70R; PR: I47V); all four had study drug-associated mutations (CA detecting more HIV-1 resistance mutations than PG). In the three ATV/r VFs, no baseline drug-associated mutations were detected by PG; for one patient CA detected RT: K65R; PR: I84V. Phylogenetic analysis revealed tight clustering for FPV/r-treated VFs with highly related clones, whereas HIV-1 from ATV/r-treated VFs had no outgrowth from baseline of low abundance resistance-containing variants. In conclusion, low-abundance HIV resistance-containing variants were detected in baseline samples from patients with VF. The archived viruses that reemerged under selection pressure and acquired additional mutations were found primarily in patients in the FPV/r arm. Despite this and a baseline resistance imbalance between the two arms, FPV/r and ATV/r provided similar virologic suppression through 48 weeks; however, these findings highlight the necessity for the development of quick and inexpensive methods for detection of minority species to better guide therapy selection."

Apart from these essential functions prerequisite for the life cycle of AAV, these rep products are able to inhibit the replication and gene expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and a number of DNA viruses. Here, it is demonstrated that Rep78, as a chimeric with the maltose binding protein, directly binds the full-length HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), and to a subset of these sequences containing the trans-activation response (TAR) sequence as DNA. These interactions, an effector protein physically binding a target promoter, suggest a direct mechanism of action for Rep78 inhibition. Furthermore, competitive binding studies between the TAR region and the full-length HIV-LTR, strongly suggested that another site(s) within the LTR was also bound by Rep78. Finally, as Rep78 binding is also believed to be affected by secondary structure within the DNA, it was found that Rep78 preferentially binds with HIV-LTR sequences with promoted secondary structure generated by heat denaturation and rapid cooling."

Protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding regions were analyzed in DNA samples obtained from 100 HIV-1-infected individuals. Primary resistance mutations to RT inhibitors were identified in 26% of patients treated with these drugs. Transmission of HIV-1-resistant strains was detected in a drug-naive patient (3%). Primary resistance mutations to protease inhibitors (PIs) were present in 9% of the 44 PI-treated patients and in 1 PI-naive individual. Phylogenetic analysis of these samples has resulted in the most extensive survey, to date, of HIV-1 genetic forms circulating in Venezuela. Ninety-nine samples clustered with subtype B, and 1 individual harbored the first B/F recombinant virus reported in Venezuela, with protease clustering with subtype F and RT with subtype B. In addition, this isolate had a new insertion (Glu-34 duplication) in the protease gene."

Yeast VLPs were efficiently incorporated into DCs via both macropinocytosis and endocytosis mediated by mannose-recognizing receptors, but not the mannose receptor. The uptake of yeast VLPs induced DC maturation and enhanced cytokine production, notably, interleukin-12 p70. We showed that yeast membrane components may contribute to DC maturation partly through Toll-like receptor 2 signaling. Thus, Gag particles encapsulated by yeast membrane may have an advantage in stimulating Gag-specific immune responses. We found that yeast VLPs, but not the control yeast membrane fraction, were able to activate both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells of HIV-infected individuals. We tested the effect of cross-presentation of VLP by DCs in two subjects recruited into a long-term nonprogressor-slow progressor cohort. When yeast VLP-loaded DCs of these patients were cocultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells for 7 days, approximately one-third of the Gag-specific CD8(+) T cells were activated and became perforin positive. However, some of the Gag-specific CD8(+) T cells appeared to be lost during in vitro culture, especially in a patient with a high virus load. Our results suggest that DCs loaded with yeast VLPs can activate Gag-specific memory CD8(+) T cells to become effector cells in chronically HIV-infected individuals, but there still remain unresponsive Gag-specific T-cell populations in these patients."
Doc No.664,4543,negative/unlabeled,8.646259,Functional analysis of the disulfide-bonded loop/chain reversal region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp41 reveals a critical role in gp120-gp41 association.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry into cells is mediated by the surface-exposed envelope protein (SU) gp120, which binds to cellular CD4 and chemokine receptors, triggering the membrane fusion activity of the transmembrane (TM) protein gp41. The core of gp41 comprises an N-terminal triple-stranded coiled coil and an antiparallel C-terminal helical segment which is packed against the exterior of the coiled coil and is thought to correspond to a fusion-activated conformation. The available gp41 crystal structures lack the conserved disulfide-bonded loop region which, in human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and murine leukemia virus TM proteins, mediates a chain reversal, connecting the antiparallel N- and C-terminal regions. Mutations in the HTLV-1 TM protein gp21 disulfide-bonded loop/chain reversal region adversely affected fusion activity without abolishing SU-TM association (A. L. Maerz, R. J. Center, B. E. Kemp, B. Kobe, and P. Poumbourios, J. Virol. 74:6614-6621, 2000). We now report that in contrast to our findings with HTLV-1, conservative substitutions in the HIV-1 gp41 disulfide-bonded loop/chain reversal region abolished association with gp120. While the mutations affecting gp120-gp41 association also affected cell-cell fusion activity, HIV-1 glycoprotein maturation appeared normal. The mutant glycoproteins were processed, expressed at the cell surface, and efficiently immunoprecipitated by conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies. The gp120 association site includes aromatic and hydrophobic residues on either side of the gp41 disulfide-bonded loop and a basic residue within the loop. The HIV-1 gp41 disulfide-bonded loop/chain reversal region is a critical gp120 contact site; therefore, it is also likely to play a central role in fusion activation by linking CD4 plus chemokine receptor-induced conformational changes in gp120 to gp41 fusogenicity. These gp120 contact residues are present in diverse primate lentiviruses, suggesting conservation of function."

Initial evaluation of these parameters was conducted in the western countries where accessible ARVs, circulating HIV subtypes and mode of transmission are different from the situation in Nigeria. This study appraised these parameters, and efficacy of generic ARVs. Consenting 106 HIV infected ARV naïve patients were enrolled. CD4 T lymphocyte and plasma HIV RNA levels were determined at interval for 24 months. Ninety eight (92.5%) of the patients who completed the follow up in strict adherence to therapy guideline were included in the analysis. Baseline median CD4 T lymphocyte increased from 114 (Range: 6-330) to highest 357 (Range: 15-1036) cells/ μ L at 18 months of therapy, while baseline median plasma viral RNA declined from 4.6 (Range: 2.6-6.0) Log10 copies/mL to undetectable level within three months of therapy. Significant CD4 T-cell restoration and plasma viral RNA decline in the study population demonstrate efficacy of the generic HAART. The importance of combined use of both parameters for evaluation of immunologic and virologic responses to ART was confirmed. "

Building on recent reports by Lehr and Zimmer (1986, DMW 111, 1001-1002) that the membrane-reactive, anti-epileptic drug diphenylhydantoin (dilantin or phenytoin) (PHT) inhibited binding of HIV to lymphocytes, we hypothesized that understanding the relevant effects of this drug on cells may shed light on aspects of HIV-1 infection. We found that PHT inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, de novo infection of various T-cell lines as well as a monocytic cell line. Moderate inhibition of HIV-1 infection was observed with drug concentrations that are therapeutic in vivo for epilepsy (approximately 20 micrograms/ml), and no concentrations used induced deleterious effects on cell growth or viability. Surprisingly, treatment of chronically infected H9 cells reduced HIV p24 expression within 1-6 weeks according to dose. This apparent induction into latency was not inhibited by cotreatment of the chronically infected cells with 5-azacytidine, which indicated that PHT was not inducing latency by induction of methylation of the viral DNA. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that PHT did not significantly reduce cell-surface expression of CD4. The possibility remained that the drug inhibited HIV infection due to its known effects on calcium-dependent cellular processes. Subsequent measurements of intracellular calcium demonstrated that an increase of [Ca2+]i occurred at least 24 hr postinfection, prior to synthesis of detectable viral structural protein p24, and that this virus-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was not due to binding of HIV to the cell. This HIV-induced rise in [Ca2+]i was significantly inhibited by PHT. PHT demonstrated variable inhibitory effects on infection of normal PHA-stimulated PBLs cultured in vitro, but it was synergistic to low-dose AZT (0.01 microgram/ml) in inhibiting infection of cell lines. Because of the known inhibitory effects of PHT on calcium-dependent biochemical processes in the cell, inhibition of HIV-1 infection by PHT suggests that calcium may play a role in HIV infection and maintenance. The drug may also be a candidate therapy for individuals infected with HIV."

We recently cloned and sequenced the viral genome of an HBV strain associated with an outbreak of fulminant hepatitis (FH strain). The FH strain contained numerous mutations in all genomic regions and was functionally characterized by a more efficient encapsidation of pregenomic RNA leading to highly enhanced replication. To define the responsible mutation(s) for the enhanced replication, we introduced individual mutations of the FH strain into a wild-type construct by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of viral replication showed that two adjacent mutations in the HBV core promotor (C to T at nucleotide 1768 and T to A at nucleotide 1770) led to high level replication. Similar to the FH strain, this mutant displayed the phenotype of enhanced encapsidation of pregenomic RNA. Functional studies in an encapsidation assay demonstrated that the identified mutations resulted in a minor increase of pregenomic RNA transcription (two- to threefold) and a major transcription-independent enhancement (> 10-fold) of viral encapsidation. Our results demonstrate that the two adjacent mutations in the HBV core promotor region are responsible for the enhanced replication of the FH strain. These two mutations, outside the previously described encapsidation signal, core, and polymerase polypeptides, appeared to affect a novel genetic element involved in viral encapsidation."

The study included 45 treatment-naive patients receiving HAART for 18 months, retrospectively defined as good (n=29) and transient (n=16) responders. HIV-specific CD8 T lymphocyte levels were measured by IFNgamma production in response to p17 Gag, in the presence of immobilized anti-CD160 mAb. We report a significantly increased baseline level of CD160+ CD8(high) subset in good therapy responders. CD160+ CD8(high) subset correlates with CD4+ T cell count, immune activation, and viral load. CD160+ CD8(high) lymphocytes contain a high amount of Granzyme B and include virus-specific T lymphocytes in HIV-1+ subjects. Co-stimulation through CD160 molecules enhances IFNgamma production in response to p17 Gag. Therefore, the CD160+ CD8(high) subset may be useful for monitoring of virus-specific cellular immunity and predicting response to antiretroviral therapy in chronic HIV-1 infection."

A high rate of p53 mutations at codon 249 has been reported in these tumors. The tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) is a useful animal model for the development of HCC after human hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or AFB1 treatment. Therefore, it was of particular interest to determine whether the p53 gene in tree shrew HCCs associated with HBV infection and/or with exposure to AFB1 is affected in the same manner as in human HCCs. We determined the tree shrew p53 wild-type nucleotide sequences by RT-PCR and automatic DNA-sequencing. Tree shrew wild-type p53 sequence showed 91.7 and 93.4% homologies with human p53 nucleotide and amino acids sequences, respectively, while it showed 77.2 and 73.7% homologies in mice. One HCC and normal liver tissue from AFB1 treated and one HCC from AFB1- and HBV-treated tree shrew showed no change in p53 sequences, while three HCCs from AFB1- and HBV-treated tree shrews showed point mutations in p53 sequences. One HCC showed point mutations at codon 275, which is on the DNA-binding domain of p53 gene, which might be a cause of gain-of-function during the development of HCC. As a result, our finding indicates that tree shrews exposed to AFB1 and/or HBV had neither codon 249 mutations nor significant levels of other mutations in the p53 gene, as is the case with humans."
Doc No.671,6981,negative/unlabeled,8.625311,A phase 1 study of adoptive transfer of autologous CD8+ T lymphocytes in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex or AIDS.,"Based on preclinical studies showing that CD8+ T lymphocytes of human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV)-infected subjects have anti-HIV activities, a phase 1 study was undertaken to determine the safety and feasibility of infusing in vitro purified, activated, and expanded CD8+ cells as a therapeutic measure in seven patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex (ARC) or AIDS. Autologous CD8+ cells were first selectively isolated in monoclonal antibody-coated flasks from peripheral blood mononuclear cells recovered by leukapheresis. They were then cultured and expanded with phytohemagglutinin and recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) before infusion. Five cycles of isolations and infusions of increasing numbers of CD8+ T cells were achieved in five of seven subjects. Five cycles could not be completed in two subjects with AIDS whose CD4+ cell counts were < or = 48/microliters. Infusions of CD8+ cells alone were well tolerated. Four patients received rIL-2 by continuous infusion for 5 days with their final cycle of CD8+ cells. All developed reversible adverse effects attributable to rIL-2. After infusion, 111In-labeled CD8+ cells quickly accumulated in the lungs, with less than 10% of the labeled cells remaining in the circulation. After 24 hours, labeled CD8+ cells were reduced in the lungs, but increased and persisted in liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Four of five patients who were treated with multiple infusions of CD8+ cells have improved or remained clinically stable, and the fifth developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia but recovered. This study demonstrated that infusion of autologous, in vitro expanded and activated CD8+ cells was feasible and clinically well tolerated in five of seven subjects with advanced HIV infections."

This paper determined the effect of men's sex-related behaviors and HIV knowledge on reported STIs. The data came from the 2012 Cameroon's Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) that were collected from 7191 respondents in 2012. Descriptive and logistic regression methods were used for data analysis. Results showed that majority of the respondents were aware of STIs and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), while 3.96% reported STIs. Also, 49.45% of the men had no wife, while 75.58% and 84.58% noted that condoms and keeping of one partner could be used to prevent HIV transmission, respectively. Wrong impressions that mosquito bites and sharing of food could lead to HIV infection were held by 31.94% and 12.44% of the men, respectively. Among those that reported STIs, 33.33%, 30.18% and 13.33% respectively used condom during sex with most recent partner, second to most recent partner and third to most recent partner, compared to 24.69%, 15.04% and 4.17% among those that did not report STIs. Logistic regression results showed that probability of STI increased significantly (p < 0.05) with condom use with third most recent partners, being married, wrong knowledge that mosquito bites cause HIV and being away for more than one month, while it significantly reduced (p < 0.05) with number of children, knowledge that having one partner prevents STIs. It was concluded that policy initiatives and programmes to enhance right sexual knowledge and behavior among men would go a long way in reducing STI incidence in Cameroon."
Doc No.673,2062,negative/unlabeled,8.616761,Measuring recent thymic emigrants in blood of normal and HIV-1-infected individuals before and after effective therapy.,"The role of the thymus in HIV-1 pathogenesis remains unclear. We developed an assay to quantify the number of recent thymic emigrants in blood based on the detection of a major excisional DNA byproduct (termed alpha1 circle) of T cell receptor rearrangement. By studying 532 normal individuals, we found that alpha1 circle numbers in blood remain high for the first 10-15 yr of life, a sharp drop is seen in the late teen years, and a gradual decline occurs thereafter. Compared with age-matched uninfected control individuals, alpha1 circle numbers in HIV-1-infected adults were significantly reduced; however, there were many individuals with normal alpha1 circle numbers. In 74 individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, we found no appreciable effect on alpha1 circle numbers in those whose baseline values were already within the normal range, but significant increases were observed in those with a preexisting impairment. The increases in alpha1 circle numbers were, however, numerically insufficient to account for the rise in levels of naive T lymphocytes. Overall, it is difficult to invoke thymic regenerative failure as a generalized mechanism for CD4 lymphocyte depletion in HIV-1 infection, as alpha1 circle numbers are normal in a substantial subset of HIV-1-infected individuals."
Doc No.674,9759,negative/unlabeled,8.61573,Infection of CD8+ T lymphocytes with HIV. Requirement for interaction with infected CD4+ cells and induction of infectious virus from chronically infected CD8+ cells.,"In this study, we have investigated the basic requirements for HIV-1 infection of CD8+ lymphocytes in vitro. Unfractionated PBL obtained from healthy HIV-1 seronegative donors were activated with PHA and infected in vitro with HIV-1LAV. Based on immunofluorescent labeling, the vast majority of cells (85 to 97%) surviving peak virus replication belonged to the CD8+ subset and only a small percentage (0.5 to 1.5%) were CD4+. Amplification of HIV-1 proviral sequences by polymerase chain reaction performed on the sorted surviving CD8+ cells demonstrated that CD8+ cells harbored HIV-1 proviral DNA. In addition, stimulation of these HIV-1-infected, CD8(+)-sorted cells either with PHA or anti-CD2 mAb resulted in induction of virus replication, as measured by reverse transcriptase activity. Electron microscopic analysis of CD8+ cells chronically infected with HIV-1 and stimulated with PHA showed typical virions budding from, and associated with, the surface of cells immunolabeled with gold beads directed toward the CD8 molecule. Infection of CD8+ cells with HIV-1 occurred only when CD4+ cells were present in the PHA-activated lymphocyte population exposed to HIV-1 at the beginning of the culture or when sorted CD8+CD4- lymphocytes were cocultured with autologous sorted CD8-CD4+ cells that had been previously infected with HIV-1. Coculture of these cells with PHA-blasts and incubation of their supernatants with a CD4+ cell line showed that these chronically infected CD8+ cells could spread HIV-1 infection to uninfected CD4+ cells after stimulation with PHA or anti-CD2 mAb. Therefore, these results suggest that the minimal requirement for in vitro infection of CD3+CD8+CD4- lymphocytes is the presence of infected CD4+ cells and that infected CD8+ T lymphocytes can further spread the infection to CD4+ cells."
Doc No.675,7955,negative/unlabeled,8.613489,Loss of viral control in early HIV-1 infection is temporally associated with sequential escape from CD8+ T cell responses and decrease in HIV-1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell frequencies.,"The outcome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is related to the set-point plasma virus load (pVL) that emerges after primary HIV-1 infection (PHI). This set-point pVL generally remains stable but eventually increases with progression to disease. However, the events leading to loss of viremic control are poorly understood. Here, we describe an individual who presented with symptomatic PHI and subsequently progressed rapidly, after an initial period of 1 year during which viral replication was well controlled. Escalation of viral replication in this atypical case was preceded by the emergence of escape variants in many epitopes targeted by dominant CD8+ T cell responses and a marked decrease in HIV-1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell frequencies. There were no changes in viral tropism, replication kinetics, or neutralizing antibody titers. These findings demonstrate the temporal relationship between viral escape from CD8+ T cell activity, decrease in HIV-1-specific T cell frequencies, and loss of control of viral replication."

A comprehensive clinical and laboratory study demonstrated pronounced regional lymphadenopathy and thymic enlargement at presentation, and that the onset of thyrotropin receptor antibody production was associated with increased production of soluble CD30 (a marker of type 2 immune responses). Blood naive CD8 T cell counts and TREC levels in both CD4 and CD8 T cells were increased at multiple time points compared with carefully selected controls. We conclude that the Graves' disease in this patient was associated with abnormally high blood counts of thymus-derived T cells, and propose that Graves' disease after HAART in this and other HIV patients may result from failure to delete autoreactive T cell clones in the regenerating thymus."

In the present work, we were interested in characterizing this inhibitory process. Data from a new luciferase-based semiquantitative assay for syncytium formation, relying on the coincubation of a T-cell line containing an HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase construct with a cell line chronically infected with HIV-1, confirmed that LPG was indeed a strong inhibitor of HIV-1-dependent syncytium formation and that this inhibition was dose-dependent. As determined by flow cytometric analyses, this inhibition was not apparently due to downregulation of CD4, CXCR4 or LFA-1, three distinct surface glycoproteins known to be important in HIV-1 mediated syncytium formation. Furthermore, LPG did not seem to affect signal transduction pathways in T cells as judged by measurement of HIV-1 LTR-driven reporter gene activity upon treatment with different stimuli. However, pretreatment of either of the cell lines used in the assay with LPG led to a significant decrease of virus-mediated syncytium formation, which was further accentuated when both cell lines were pretreated. LPG inhibition of HIV-1 replication was next assessed. When measuring either infection with luciferase-encoding recombinant HIV-1 particles or multinucleated giant cell formation following an acute virus infection, we again observed that LPG was efficient at blocking HIV-1 replication. Specific assays probing different steps of viral entry demonstrated that attachment was not hindered by LPG but that viral entry was modulated, suggesting that LPG targets a postbinding step. Hence, incorporation of LPG into a target cell membrane could influence its fluidity and diminish both the virus-cell and cell-to-cell fusion processes initiated by HIV-1."
Doc No.678,2448,negative/unlabeled,8.599974,A model system for human cytomegalovirus-mediated modulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat activity in brain cells.,"Previously, our laboratory showed that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) activates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in brain-derived cells with limited HIV-1 gene expression but inhibits HIV-1 in cells fully permissive for replication of both viruses (F. M. Jault, S. A. Spector, and D. H. Spector, J. Virol. 68:959-973, 1994). To investigate these effects further, we developed a model system that uncouples HIV-1 gene expression from long terminal repeat (LTR) activity. Two monoclonal U373-MG astrocytoma/glioblastoma cell lines (LTRIG and LIGHIVDC) were generated, each containing an integrated copy of an LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct and the Escherichia coli lacI gene. LIGHIVDC also has an inducible HIV-1 genome controlled by a Rous sarcoma virus promoter with lac operator sequences. Basal LTR-mediated CAT activity is 65-fold higher in LIGHIVDC than in LTRIG, and this activity is further increased (20-fold) following incubation of LIGHIVDC with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Tat protein can be detected by immunostaining in LIGHIVDC. However, Rev-mediated transport and subsequent translation of the singly spliced and unspliced HIV-1 mRNAs is inefficient. In the absence of Tat, HCMV stimulated CAT activity approximately 20-fold, and this activation required HCMV gene expression but not viral DNA replication. LTR-directed transcription was unaffected by HCMV infection in LIGHIVDC but was inhibited in these cells when they contained increased Tat levels following IPTG induction. These results support the hypothesis that HCMV can induce the HIV-1 LTR when HIV-1 gene expression is minimal and that a threshold level of HIV-1 gene products is necessary for HCMV to inhibit this promoter."

HBsAg positive patients with raised transaminases had increased primary cytotoxicity similar to nine otherwise healthy subjects with acute hepatitis B. HBsAg positive patients with normal transaminases showed decreased primary cytotoxicity and recovered patients showed normal values. Increased primary cytotoxicity could not be attributed to an increase in T lymphocytes, as all groups of hemodialysis patients had decreased lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte counts without significant differences between them. In the follow-up study none of the 13 HBsAg positive patients with normal transaminases recovered. However, five of the 18 patients with raised transaminases did recover from hepatitis B, accompanied by a decrease in cytotoxicity. These results show that an increased PHA-induced lymphocyte cytotoxicity corresponds with the occurrence of liver cell damage and subsequent recovery in hemodialysis patients with HBV infection. This suggests that cytotoxic T lymphocytes are involved in liver cell damage and recovery in HBV infection."

Moreover, previous research has focused on samples of adults. In 1996-1998, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adolescents and high-risk, noninfected adolescents (n = 182) were recruited at 16 locations in 13 US cities into the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) project, to the authors' knowledge, the first national study of disease progression among HIV-positive adolescents who were infected through sexual behavior or injection drug use. Self-report of marijuana use was assessed through audio computer-assisted self-administered interviewing (ACASI). Urines were tested for marijuana at a certified laboratory by using the enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique. Conditional kappas for 2-, 5-, and 7-day self-reports were 0.57, 0.71, and 0.69, respectively. Maximum sensitivity was obtained from a combination of ACASI and urine drug testing. Contrary to previous studies, the data suggest that if a single evaluative instrument is to be used for prevalence, ACASI is more sensitive than urine drug testing for marijuana overall, but particularly for HIV-infected adolescents."

Thus, 213 Caucasian adult HIV-infected patients were studied, 111 of whom had HCV-coinfection and 68 were HCV-monoinfected. Patients with ethanol consumption >50 g/day, hepatitis B coinfection, non-infective liver diseases or HAART adherence <75% were excluded. LF was assessed by transient elastometry (TE, Fibroscan). Serum levels of MMPs (MMP -1,-2,-3,-8,-9,-10 and -13) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP-1,-2 and -4) were measured by ELISA microarrays. Associations with LF were statistically analysed. Protease inhibitors, usually administered to patients with advanced LF were excluded from the analysis. Increased LF was significantly associated with d4T (P = 0.006) and didanosine (ddI) use (P = 0.007), months on d4T (P = 0.001) and on ARV (P = 0.025), duration of HIV (P < 0.0001) and HCV infections (P < 0.0001), higher HIV (P = 0.03) and HCV loads (P < 0.0001), presence of lipodystrophy (P = 0.02), male gender (P = 0.02), older age (P = 0.04), low nadir (P = 0.02) and current CD4(+) T-cells (P < 0.0001), low gain of CD4(+) T-cells after HAART (P = 0.01) and higher MMP-2 (P = 0.02) and TIMP-2 serum levels (P = 0.02). By logistic regression the only variables significantly associated with increased LF were: use of ddI (OR 8.77, 95% CI: 2.36-32.26; P = 0.005), male gender (OR 7.75, 95% CI: 2.33-25.64, P = 0.0008), HCV viral load (in log) (OR 3.53, 95% CI: 2.16-5.77; P < 0.0001) and age (in years) (OR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09-1.34, P = 0.0003). We conclude that only higher HCV viral load, older age, male gender, and use of ddI associated independently with increased LF in our study."

The role that latency is playing in preventing clearance of the virus infection has become evident in recent years. Patients who have been successfully treated with ART, having undetectable levels of viral RNA (below 50 copies/ml) in the plasma for years, experienced rapid virus rebound on withdrawal of therapy. Activation of latent proviruses from the infected cells in combination with ART is a therapeutic strategy that may lead to the complete elimination of HIV infection. We report here that suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), can activate an HIV-1 vector provirus in a cell model system. Treatment of cells harboring a latent, HIV-1-derived provirus caused activation of both early and late viral gene expression, acetylation of nucleosome on the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), and remodeling of the chromatin at the 5' LTR. Several compounds, including valproic acid, have been tested for their ability to activate latent HIV-1, but have met with disappointing results. SAHA, a relatively nontoxic, FDA-approved compound, should be considered for developing a strategy to eliminate HIV from patients."

To further clarify this relationship, we have studied the dynamics of Gag-specific CD8 T-cell responses in relation to plasma viral load and time since infection in 33 chronically infected subjects over a 9-month period. High baseline viral loads were associated with a net loss of breadth (P < 0.001) and a decrease in the total magnitude of the Gag-specific T-cell response in general (P = 0.03). Most importantly, the baseline viral load predicted the subsequent change in the breadth of Gag recognition over time (P < 0.0001, r(2) = 0.41). Compared to maintained responses, lost responses were low in magnitude (P < 0.0001) and subdominant in the hierarchy of Gag-specific responses. The present study indicates that chronic exposure of the human immune system to high levels of HIV viremia is a determinant of virus-specific CD8 T-cell loss."

In Korea, zidovudine has been widely administered, without charge, through the National AIDS program since the early 1990s; with other potent antiretroviral agents also being introduced in the late 1990s. An analysis of the drug susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs was performed by genotyping of the drug-resistant mutations in HIV on plasma samples from 50 HIV-infected patients who had received no treatment, between February 1998 and November 2002, which was interpreted according to the consensus guidelines of the International AIDS Society-USA panel. The median CD4 cell count was 100 cells/mm3; the mean plasma RNA level was (5.19 +/- 0.56) log copies per milliliter. Of the 50 subjects tested 4 (8.0%) had one or more major drug-resistance mutation. The prevalence of resistance to multiple classes of drugs was 2.0%. No mutations, associated with resistance to non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, were identified. Resistant mutations of the reverse-transcriptase gene were found at codons 67, 70, 118, 215, and 219, and a resistant mutation of the protease gene was found only at codon 46 (2.6%, 1 of 39). There was an 8.0% prevalence of primary drug resistance to antiretroviral drugs in Korean patients infected with HIV-1."
Doc No.685,9559,negative/unlabeled,8.579388,T-cell responses targeting HIV Nef uniquely correlate with infected cell frequencies after long-term antiretroviral therapy.,"HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses limit viral replication in untreated infection. After the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), these responses decay and the infected cell population that remains is commonly considered to be invisible to T-cells. We hypothesized that HIV antigen recognition may persist in ART-treated individuals due to low-level or episodic protein expression. We posited that if persistent recognition were occurring it would be preferentially directed against the early HIV gene products Nef, Tat, and Rev as compared to late gene products, such as Gag, Pol, and Env, which have higher barriers to expression. Using a primary cell model of latency, we observed that a Nef-specific CD8+ T-cell clone exhibited low-level recognition of infected cells prior to reactivation and robust recognition shortly thereafter. A Gag-specific CD8+ T-cell clone failed to recognized infected cells under these conditions, corresponding with a lack of detectable Gag expression. We measured HIV-specific T-cell responses in 96 individuals who had been suppressed on ART for a median of 7 years, and observed a significant, direct correlation between cell-associated HIV DNA levels and magnitudes of IFN-γ-producing Nef/Tat/Rev-specific T-cell responses. This correlation was confirmed in an independent cohort (n = 18). Correlations were not detected between measures of HIV persistence and T-cell responses to other HIV antigens. The correlation with Nef/Tat/Rev-specific T-cells was attributable to Nef-specific responses, the breadth of which also correlated with HIV DNA levels. These results suggest that ongoing Nef expression in ART-treated individuals drives preferential maintenance and/or expansion of T-cells reactive to this protein, implying sensing of infected cells by the immune system. The direct correlation, however, suggests that recognition does not result in efficient elimination of infected cells. These results raise the possibility that enhancing the cytolytic activity of Nef-specific T-cells may lead to reductions in infected cell frequencies, even in the absence of therapeutic latency reversal."

The present study hypothesized that patients from a sexually transmitted infection center in Russia who perpetrated IPV or were victims of IPV would be more likely to have HIV risk behaviors including injection drug use, multiple partners, and inconsistent condom use than those who were not involved with IPV. We used a self-administered questionnaire to collect information from 381 patients on demographics, health status, injection drug use, sexual behaviors, and violence involving sexual partners between 2008 and 2009. After including sociodemographics, lifetime IPV perpetration was significantly associated with having had multiple sexual partners among male patients (odds ratio [OR] = 2.61, p < .05). IPV victimization was significantly associated with injection drug use among male and female patients (OR = 5.22, p < .05) and with inconsistent condom use among female patients (OR = 8.93, p < .05). IPV perpetration and victimization were common among male and female study participants and were associated with greater HIV risk behaviors. HIV prevention programs in Russia should address the risks associated with IPV among people at risk for HIV."

In 26 years of intensive research efforts, the identity of the major CD8(+) cell antiviral factor has remained elusive. To investigate the mechanism for this antiviral immune response, we performed gene expression analyses on primary CD4(+) cells that were exposed to HIV-suppressing CD8(+) cells or CD8(+) cell-conditioned medium having HIV-suppressing activity. These experiments revealed increased levels of multiple genes stimulated by type I interferons (IFN; eg, IFN-α and IFN-β). Further evaluation revealed that primary CD8(+) cells, particularly those from elite controllers and other asymptomatic HIV-1-infected individuals, secrete IFN, and this response directly contributes to the in vitro suppression of HIV replication in CD4(+) cells. This novel immune response, likely mediated by memory CD8(+) T cells, may play an important role in a wide variety of viral infections, cancers, and autoimmune diseases. "
Doc No.688,4960,negative/unlabeled,8.567649,AIDS Drug Assistance Programs: highlighting inequities in human immunodeficiency virus-infection health care in the United States.,"The AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) were founded in 1987 to pay for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related medications in the United States and to help provide prescriptions for HIV-infected patients ineligible for Medicaid who have no private health insurance. As HIV care has shifted from the inpatient to the outpatient arena and as patients live longer because of more-effective antiretroviral therapy, medication costs have increased, and ADAPs have increasingly been operating under emergency measures, with coverage limitations and eligibility restrictions. Because these programs operate at the state level, inequalities in resource distribution to those in need are manifest and appear to contribute to differences in disease outcomes that are based solely on patients' place of residence. Cost-effectiveness analysis would offer a more informed basis for distribution of ADAP resources in an efficient and equitable manner, leading to a standardized national structure."
Doc No.689,3644,negative/unlabeled,8.56636,Zinc finger protein designed to target 2-long terminal repeat junctions interferes with human immunodeficiency virus integration.,"Integration of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome into the host chromosome is a vital step in the HIV life cycle. The highly conserved cytosine-adenine (CA) dinucleotide sequence immediately upstream of the cleavage site is crucial for integrase (IN) activity. As this viral enzyme has an important role early in the HIV-1 replication cycle, interference with the IN substrate has become an attractive strategy for therapeutic intervention. We demonstrated that a designed zinc finger protein (ZFP) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) targets the 2-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) circle junctions of HIV-1 DNA with nanomolar affinity. We report now that 2LTRZFP-GFP stably transduced into 293T cells interfered with the expression of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped lentiviral red fluorescent protein (RFP), as shown by the suppression of RFP expression. We also used a third-generation lentiviral vector and pCEP4 expression vector to deliver the 2LTRZFP-GFP transgene into human T-lymphocytic cells, and a stable cell line for long-term expression studies was selected for HIV-1 challenge. HIV-1 integration and replication were inhibited as measured by Alu-gag real-time PCR and p24 antigen assay. In addition, the molecular activity of 2LTRZFP-GFP was evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The results were confirmed by Alu-gag real-time PCR for integration interference. We suggest that the expression of 2LTRZFP-GFP limited viral integration on intracellular immunization, and that it has potential for use in HIV gene therapy in the future."
Doc No.690,6093,negative/unlabeled,8.557304,Composition of peripheral blood lymphocyte populations during different stages of chronic infection with hepatitis B virus.,"To characterize the immunological populations associated with different stages of chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), we performed flow cytometric analyses on the peripheral blood leucocytes of 29 patients with various forms of chronic hepatitis B. The clinical spectrum of the patients ranged from asymptomatic infections, in the presence of high virus production, to intermittent or recurrent exacerbations of liver injury alternating with relatively normal liver function. Patients with partial resolution of disease who experienced an initial acute flare followed by prolonged seroconversion showed decreased percentages of CD3+ cells during the seroconversion phase when levels of serum alanine transferase (ALT) had normalized. These CD3+ cells were predominantly CD4+ cells bearing the alpha beta+ T-cell receptor (TCR). In addition, we saw an increase in CD4+ and CD8+ cells bearing the gamma delta TCR in those patients who had seroconverted. No significant differences were seen between any of the groups with respect to percentage of cells with a naive (CD45RA) or memory (CD45RO) phenotype, or of cells displaying the activation markers CD38, HLA-DR or CD57. Longitudinal analyses of 15 patients failed to show any consistent pattern of changes in the immunophenotypic profile during acute flares and their resolution. Our results indicate that the turnover of circulating T lymphocytes during the apparent quiescent phase of chronic infections is higher than that during acute exacerbations, suggesting an active immunosurveillance role of T-cell subpopulations in maintaining low virus levels during seroconversion."
Doc No.691,2221,negative/unlabeled,8.555288,Sequence specificity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (hiv-2) long terminal repeat u3 region in vivo allows subtyping of the principal hiv-2 viral subtypes a and b.,"Sequences from the nef/LTR overlap region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) genome were amplified from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 40 HIV-2-infected individuals in The Gambia, West Africa. Additional sequences from the plasma of three blood donors were also derived. Analysis of HIV-2 U3 LTR transcription factor elements (PuB-1, p-ets, PuB-2, peri-kappa B, and NF-kappa B sites) indicated a relatively high level of conservation in vivo. The region immediately 3' of the nef termination codon, which exhibits clade-dependent specificity, was targeted by PCR to differentiate HIV-2 subtype A from subtype B infections, the two principal clinical HIV-2 subtypes. All clinical samples analyzed (n = 43) from The Gambia were identified as HIV-2 subtype A by a combination of LTR sequence analysis and subtype-specific amplification of subtypes A and B. Differential PCR amplification of the HIV-2 U3 LTR region represents a rapid means of differentiating subtype A from subtype B infections, the two dominant HIV-2 subtypes that are important in human disease."
Doc No.692,9517,positive/labeled,8.553056,Beneficial effects of a combination of Korean red ginseng and highly active antiretroviral therapy in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected patients.,"To determine whether Korean red ginseng (KRG) has beneficial effects on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients administered highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we analyzed the CD4 T-cell count, viral load, and resistance mutations to HAART in 46 individuals. Thirteen patients harbored resistance mutations at baseline. The study population was divided into two groups: specifically, a group treated with a combination of HAART plus KRG (23 patients) and a group treated with HAART alone (23 patients). The annual increase in CD4 T-cell count in the combination group was significantly higher than that in the group treated with HAART alone (P < 0.05). Overall, 21 patients harbored resistance mutations after 3 years of therapy. Following exclusion of 13 patients displaying baseline resistance mutations, 7.1% of patients (1/14) in the combination group and 42.1% (8/19) in the HAART group were identified with resistance mutations. One patient with baseline resistance mutations in the combination group did not display resistance mutations 3 years after HAART therapy. High-level resistance mutations were significantly lower in the combination group than in the group treated with HAART alone. Five patients showed no improvement in viral copy number (26.3% [5/19]) in the combination group and 9 (45.0% [9/20]) showed no improvement in the HAART-only group. Our data support the clinical utility of KRG intake during HAART therapy."

A report from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study.,"In a multicenter cohort study of homosexual men, the proportion of seropositives at enrollment who developed the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) during the following 18 months ranged from 5.5% to 8.2% in 1597 alcohol drinkers vs 9.2% in 109 nondrinkers with no clear trend according to use, and from 6.3% to 9.6% for 1662 users vs 7.2% for 83 nonusers of psychoactive drugs prior to enrollment. Among seropositive men with low initial T helper lymphocyte counts, those who continued to use drugs showed no significantly higher 18-month risk of AIDS than nonusers (13% vs 10%); the corresponding risks were 13% and 15%, respectively, for continued heavier vs continued lighter consumption of alcohol. No other manifestations of immunodeficiency were positively associated with substance use prior to enrollment. Prior use was not associated with low mean T helper cell counts at enrollment, and continued drug or alcohol use after enrollment was not associated with greater subsequent decline in counts. As used in a large cohort of homosexual men, psychoactive substances did not enhance the progression of human immunodeficiency virus infection."

Doc No.695,5469,negative/unlabeled,8.543366,Accumulation of human immunodeficiency virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes away from the predominant site of virus replication during primary infection.,"Down-regulation of the initial burst of viremia during primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is thought to be mediated predominantly by HIV-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). This response is associated with major perturbations in the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. To investigate the failure of the cellular immune response to adequately control viral spread and replication and to prevent establishment of HIV infection, changes in the TCR repertoire and in the distribution of virus-specific CTL between blood and lymph node were analyzed in three patients with primary infection. By the combined use of clonotype-specific polymerase chain reaction and analysis of the frequency of in vivo activated HIV-specific CTL, it was shown that HIV-specific CTL clones preferentially accumulated in blood as opposed to lymph node. Accumulation of HIV-specific CTL in blood occurred prior to effective down-regulation of virus replication in both blood and lymph node. These findings should provide new insights into how HIV, and possibly other viruses, elude the immune response of the host during primary infection."
Doc No.696,6968,negative/unlabeled,8.542964,Recent origin of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 variants in resting CD4+ T lymphocytes in untreated and suboptimally treated subjects.,"Resting CD4(+) T lymphocytes are an important reservoir for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in treated patients with undetectable viremia. The knowledge of viral persistence in these cells is limited, however, for patients without treatment or patients for whom treatment is failing; therefore, this reservoir in such patients was characterized. Virus variants were characterized in 3 subjects who were followed-up from primary HIV-1 infection and 5 treatment-experienced subjects. No founder viral sequences and only a minority of the earlier identified drug-induced mutations were found in the resting T lymphocytes. Instead, the viral sequences were closely related to those detected simultaneously in plasma, except in 2 treatment-experienced subjects. Thus, a turnover and replenishment of this virus reservoir in peripheral blood is likely to occur in most persons with detectable viremia. However, infrequently the virus variants in plasma and resting T cells seem to be derived from independent sources."
Doc No.697,3345,negative/unlabeled,8.539674,Differences in HCV-specific T cell responses between chronic HCV infection and HIV/HCV co-infection.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were investigated using a panel of 728 overlapping peptides spanning the whole HCV genome in 47 HCV mono-infected and 26 HIV/HCV co-infected individuals using the IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay and flow cytometry. The frequency of HCV-specific T cell responses was similar (approximately 40%) in both groups, but the breadth of the T cell responses tended to be reduced in HIV/HCV co-infected individuals. Of interest, 23 new HCV-derived epitopes were identified, and CD4+ HCV-specific T cell responses were detected overall in a proportion similar to CD8+ T cell responses. A tendency towards a dominant CD8+ T cell response was associated with HIV/HCV co-infection. HCV-specific CD8+ T cells secreted both IL-2 and IFN-gamma, although a reduction in the percentage of IL-2/IFN-gamma-secreting cells was observed in HIV/HCV co-infected individuals. The increase in CD4+ T cell counts after antiretroviral therapy in HIV/HCV co-infected individuals was not associated with restoration of HCV-specific T cell responses. Altogether, these results provide new insights into the characterization of HCV-specific T cell responses in HCV mono-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected individuals."
Doc No.698,7214,negative/unlabeled,8.539213,The appearance of drug resistance-associated point mutations in HIV type 1 plasma RNA precedes their appearance in proviral DNA.,"Point mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) have been associated with reduced sensitivity of the virus to inhibition by the antiretroviral drug zidovudine (ZDV). During therapy we have previously observed the accumulation of these mutations, at codons 41, 67, 70, 215, and 219 of the RT gene, in proviral DNA sequences from infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in cell-free virus RNA. Using a quantitative point mutation assay (PMA) we have been able to quantify the proportions of mutant and wild-type sequences at these points in mixed populations of viral RNA and DNA derived from clinical samples. Thus we have confirmed that the mutations can be detected earlier in cell-free virus RNA than in PBMC proviral DNA and their accumulation in RNA precedes that in DNA. We have analyzed serial samples from 10 subjects undergoing zidovudine therapy and shown significantly higher levels of mutations in cell-free viral RNA than in PBMC proviral DNA at codons 41, 70, and 215 during the in vivo acquisition of the mutations. In the group of subjects studied the mean time delay between RNA and DNA reaching a given level of mutation was 25 days."

Among these, the N-terminal region of gp41 contains cluster I (amino acids [aa] 580 to 623), comprising the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitope (AVERYLKDQQLL) and the cysteine loop (CSGKLIC), and cluster II (aa 646 to 682), comprising an ectodomain region (ELDKWA). To delineate the epitope diversity within clusters I and II and to determine whether the diversity affects serologic detection by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits, gp41 Env sequences from 247 seropositive persons infected with HIV-1 group M, subtypes A (n = 42), B (n = 62), B' (n = 13), C (n = 38), D (n = 41), E (n = 18), F (n = 27), and G (n = 6), and 6 HIV-1-infected but persistently seronegative (HIPS) persons were analyzed. While all IDR were highly conserved among both seropositive and HIPS persons, minor amino acid substitutions (<20% for any one residue, mostly conservative) were observed for all subtypes, except for B', in comparison with the consensus sequence for each subtype. Most importantly, none of the observed substitutions among the group M plasma specimens affected antibody detection, since all specimens (n = 152) tested positive with all five FDA-licensed EIA kits. Furthermore, all specimens reacted with a group M consensus gp41 peptide (WGIKQLQARVLAVERYLKDQQLLGIWGCSGKLICTTAVPWNASW), and high degrees of cross-reactivity (>80%) were observed with an HIV-1 group N peptide, an HIV-1 group O peptide, and a peptide derived from the homologous region of gp41 from simian immunodeficiency virus from chimpanzee (SIVcpz). Taken together, these data indicate that the minor substitutions observed within the IDR of gp41 of HIV-1 group M subtypes do not affect antibody recognition and that all HIV-1-seropositive specimens containing the observed substitutions react with the FDA-licensed EIA kits regardless of viral genotype and geographic origin."

Because of the limited sensitivity of commercial assays, transmitted drug resistance (TDR) may be underestimated; thus, the effect that TDR has on treatment outcome needs to be investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of TDR in HIV-infected patients and to evaluate the significance of TDR with respect to treatment outcome by analyzing plasma viral RNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cell proviral DNA for the presence of drug resistance mutations."
Doc No.701,1025,negative/unlabeled,8.535649,The human factors YY1 and LSF repress the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat via recruitment of histone deacetylase 1.,"Enigmatic mechanisms restore the resting state in activated lymphocytes following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, rarely allowing persistent nonproductive infection. We detail a mechanism whereby cellular factors could establish virological latency. The transcription factors YY1 and LSF cooperate in repression of transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). LSF recruits YY1 to the LTR via the zinc fingers of YY1. The first two zinc fingers were observed to be sufficient for this interaction in vitro. A mutant of LSF incapable of binding DNA blocked repression. Like other transcriptional repressors, YY1 can function via recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC). We find that HDAC1 copurifies with the LTR-binding YY1-LSF repressor complex, the domain of YY1 that interacts with HDAC1 is required to repress the HIV-1 promoter, expression of HDAC1 augments repression of the LTR by YY1, and the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A blocks repression mediated by YY1. This novel link between HDAC recruitment and inhibition of HIV-1 expression by YY1 and LSF, in the natural context of a viral promoter integrated into chromosomal DNA, is the first demonstration of a molecular mechanism of repression of HIV-1. YY1 and LSF may establish transcriptional and virological latency of HIV, a state that has recently been recognized in vivo and has significant implications for the long-term treatment of AIDS."

These highly efficacious, well-tolerated, all-oral HCV regimens allow cure of HCV in over 95% of HCV-monoinfected as well as HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with short treatment durations of 8-12 weeks. Areas covered: This review will address recent developments of DAA-therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients in clinical trials and real life cohorts and evaluate remaining challenges, particularly resistance, drug-drug interactions, acute HCV infection and liver transplantation focusing on HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Expert opinion: Indeed, all available data have shown that HIV/HCV-coinfection has no impact on HCV-treatment outcome. Management, indication of therapy and follow-up of HCV-infection are now the same for both patient populations. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients however, require careful evaluation of potential drug-drug-interactions between HCV drugs and HIV antiretroviral therapy, medication for substance abuse and other comedications. The few remaining gaps in DAA-therapy in particular treatment of cirrhotic treatment-experienced genotype 3 infections, decompensated cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease and patients with prior DAA treatment failure have mostly been overcome by the development of new HCV agents recently licensed. Clearly, the biggest challenge globally remains the access to treatment and the inclusion of all patient populations affected in particular people who inject drugs (PWID)."
Doc No.705,2335,negative/unlabeled,8.519108,Viral RNA and p24 antigen as markers of HIV disease and antiretroviral treatment success.,"HIV-1 RNA has become the standard for monitoring antiretroviral therapies. Dogma predicts, however, that a viral protein like p24 should be at least as good a marker of HIV disease activity, provided that it is measured with sufficient sensitivity and accuracy. Simple modifications including use of a more efficient virus lysis buffer, heat-mediated destruction of antibodies interfering with antigen detection, and tyramide signal amplification for increased sensitivity have highly improved the HIV-1 p24 antigen assay. The p24 antigen assay is inferior to RT-PCR in detecting viral particles, but the presence of extraviral p24 antigen in most samples makes largely up for this. p24 antigen testing is similarly sensitive and specific in diagnosing pediatric HIV infection, in predicting CD4+ T cell decline and clinical progression at early and late stage of infection, and suitable for antiretroviral treatment monitoring in both adults and children. Notably, p24 antigen was measurable even in patients with stably suppressed viremia, and its concentrations were correlated negatively with the concentrations of CD4+ T cells and positively with the concentrations of activated CD8+ T cell subsets. p24 antigen is an excellent marker of HIV expression and disease activity and can be used in the same fields of application as HIV RNA is used. The test is validated for subtype B, but requires further studies for non-B subtypes."

A level of tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) in dried blood spots (DBS) <1,250 fmol/punch is predicted to identify imperfect adherence. Herein we evaluated TFV-DP in DBS as a measure of adherence among HIV-infected women. DBS and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected twice (∼1 week apart) in 35 well-controlled HIV-infected women [median age 42 years, 14 African American/black (AA)] receiving daily coformulated tenofovir/emtricitabine and either atazanavir/ritonavir (n=20) or raltegravir (n=16). TFV-DP in DBS and PBMCs was quantified by LC-MS/MS. Six-month adherence was measured as average days between monthly pharmacy refills. Data were loge transformed for analysis and presented as median (range); the correlation between continuous variables was analyzed using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The average TFV-DP between the two visits (aTFV-DP) in DBS and PBMCs was 1,874 (706-3,776) fmol/punch and 125 (1-278) fmol/10(6) cells, respectively. AA women had lower levels of aTFV-DP in DBS compared to whites (1,660 vs. 1,970 fmol/punch; p=0.04), with a viremic patient having the lowest drug levels (706 fmol/punch). Days between pharmacy refills were 34 (30-54) vs. 30 (26-40) in women with TFV-DP in DBS <1,250 vs. ≥1,250 fmol/punch (p=0.006). TFV-DP in DBS was negatively correlated with an increasing number of days between refills (r=-0.56, p=0.002). TFV-DP DBS was a reliable and objective measure of adherence in HIV-infected women based on a strong inverse relationship with pharmacy refill adherence."

Clearance rates of HIV RNA and HIV DNA in peripheral blood as well as the preexistence and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of HIV were determined over 52 weeks of treatment. The data indicate that HAART is able to induce a suppression of plasma viral load together with a significant decrease, but not a suppression, of peripheral blood mononuclear cell-associated proviral DNA in PHI subjects. Analysis of drug-resistant strains revealed that three PHI patients, showing a complete virologic response, developed mutations in the pol gene, thus suggesting that a persistent residual virus replication exists despite a sustained suppression of plasma viremia."

In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the care of these patients has become increasingly complex as survival has improved. Patients infected with HIV who also have ESRD are at risk for critical interactions between medication regimens to treat both of these conditions. Within this population, hemo- and peritoneal dialysis as well as kidney transplantation are life sustaining but present a host of obstacles related to HIV monitoring and risk of transmission, access thrombosis, infection, and rejection.

Eleven individuals had highly conserved sequences compared with previously reported CRF01_AE viruses. However, T cell-specific factor (TCF)-1alpha motif, which is located just beside the 3' terminus of the nef sequence, was duplicated in 2 out of the 13 subjects, one of whom had also lost the 24 nucleotides next to the 3' of the primer-binding site. Thus, several characteristics of CRF01_AE LTR and gag-leader sequence were identified in some samples recently obtained in Thailand."

This increase has been observed for all T cell lymphoma subtypes. In the present report we describe clinical and pathological features of three consecutive cases of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) with cytotoxic phenotype in HIV-positive patients that came to our attention in May-September 2002. The diagnosis of PTCL was made in lymph node (two cases) and in needle biopsies from liver and bone marrow of the same patient. The patients were two females (31 and 45 years old) and one male (49 years old). The risk factor for each patient was heterosexual, injecting drug user, and homosexual, respectively. CD4 cell counts were low (79-81 cells/mm3). Two patients were naive for antiretroviral therapy. At histological examination, all the involved tissues were effaced by a neoplastic proliferation of CD3+/CD8+ medium to large pleomorphic cells containing TIA-1+ cytotoxic granules and a few granzyme B+ granules. Neoplastic cells were not infected by EBV or by HHV-8. They were negative for the B cell antigens CD20 and CD79a, for CD30 and for CD56. Clonal T cell receptor-g (TCR-g) rearrangements were demonstrated in the three cases."
Doc No.711,7416,positive/labeled,8.510438,Changing clinical profile and factors associated with liver enzyme abnormalities among HIV-infected persons.,"The spectrum of liver disease among HIV-infected patients is changing. In the era of antiretroviral therapy, opportunistic infections are diminishing and deranged liver function appears to be due usually to drug-induced liver injury, alcohol, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or chronic hepatitis B. To test this hypothesis, 98 HIV-positive patients with deranged liver function were compared with matched HIV-positive patients with normal liver function and likewise matched HIV-negative patients with normal liver function tests."
Doc No.712,9129,negative/unlabeled,8.508206,Agents for treating human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"The replicative cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is reviewed, and currently used and investigational agents directed against the virus are discussed. The first step in the replication of HIV is selective binding of the envelope glycoprotein to CD4 receptors located on T lymphocytes. The virion is then uncoated within the cytoplasm, yielding viral genomic RNA. Reverse transcriptase uses the viral RNA as a template to form single-stranded DNA, which is duplicated to form proviral DNA through the activity of ribonuclease H. Host RNA polymerases transcribe the integrated proviral DNA into messenger RNA, and there is subsequent translation to viral proteins. After translation, further modification of precursor polyproteins is necessary to produce functional peptides. The assembled virus then buds from the cell surface and invades other cells. Targets of drug intervention in the replicative cycle include (1) binding and entry, (2) reverse transcriptase, (3) transcription and translation, and (4) viral maturation and budding. Inhibitors of binding and entry include recombinant soluble CD4, immunoadhesins, peptide T, and hypericin. Nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors include zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, and stavudine. Foscarnet, tetrahydroimidazobenzo-diazepinthione compounds, and nevirapine are some nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. Inhibitors of transcription and translation include antagonists of the tat gene and GLQ223. Castanospermine, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, and protease inhibitors interfere with viral maturation and budding. Drug combinations that have been or are being investigated include zidovudine plus interferon alfa, zidovudine plus zalcitabine, and zidovudine plus didanosine. Four agents currently have approved labeling for use against HIV infection: zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, and stavudine. Monotherapy with zidovudine remains the treatment of first choice. Although progress has been made in developing drug therapies for HIV infection, more selective and more potent drugs are urgently needed. The best approach at present is to optimize the use of available agents, continue to investigate new therapies, and educate the public about prevention."
Doc No.713,3071,negative/unlabeled,8.50163,Coccidioidomycosis in persons infected with HIV-1.,"Coccidioidomycosis is a recognized opportunistic infection in those with HIV-1 infection. The major risk factor is immunodeficiency, particularly when the peripheral blood CD4 T lymphocyte count is below 250/muL. There are many manifestations of coccidioidomycosis during HIV-1 infection, including diffuse, reticulonodular pneumonia, focal primary pneumonia, and disease disseminated beyond the thoracic cavity. Diagnosis is based on serology, culture and histopathologic identification. Two therapeutic modalities are currently available, the polyene antifungal amphotericin B and the triazole antifungals. Of the latter, the most experience is with the triazoles fluconazole and itraconazole. There are increasing data regarding drug interactions between triazoles and antiretroviral agents. The duration of treatment of coccidioidomycosis in those with HIV-1 infection is not established and in many patients it is either prolonged or life-long. Adherence to antiretroviral therapy is important in preventing recurrence."

The available antiretroviral compounds can only control viremia, but it is impossible to eliminate the virus from the organism, namely because HIV-1 provirus persists in the reservoir cells from which the virus repeatedly disseminates into new cells. Current therapeutic approaches, however, do not specifically address the stage of virus reactivation. Heme has been demonstrated as very efficient in inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcription, while its derivative hemin ameliorated HIV-1 infection via induction of heme oxygenase-1. Normosang (heme arginate; HA) is a human hemin-containing compound used to treat acute porphyria. In this work, we studied the effects of HA in HIV-1-acutely infected T-cell lines, and in cell lines harboring either a complete HIV-1 provirus (ACH-2 cells) or an HIV-1 ""mini-virus"" (Jurkat clones expressing EGFP under control of HIV LTR). We demonstrate that HA inhibited HIV-1 replication during the acute infection, which was accompanied by the inhibition of reverse transcription. On the other hand, HA alone stimulated the reactivation of HIV-1 ""mini-virus"" and synergized with phorbol ester or TNF-α in the reactivation of HIV-1 provirus. The stimulatory effects of HA were inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine, suggesting an increased redox stress and activation of NF-κB. Further, HA induced expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in ACH-2 cells, while HO-1 was found expressed in untreated Jurkat clones. Inhibitor of HO-1 activity, tin protoporphyrin IX, further increased HA-mediated reactivation of HIV-1 ""mini-virus"" in Jurkat clones, and this effect was also inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine. The stimulatory effects of HA on HIV-1 reactivation thus seem to involve HO-1 and generation of free radicals. Additionally, the effective concentrations of HA did neither affect normal T-cell activation with PMA nor induce activation of the unstimulated cells. In conclusion, HA appears to possess a combination of unique properties that could help to decrease the pool of latently infected reservoir cells, while simultaneously inhibiting HIV-1 replication in newly infected cells. Our results thus suggest a new direction to explore in treatment of HIV/AIDS disease."
Doc No.715,6792,positive/labeled,8.497292,Syringe type and drug injector risk for HIV infection: a case study in Texas.,"Studies of accidental needlestick exposure to blood containing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have shown that the volume of blood in an exposure is a strong predictor of subsequent infection. Illicit drug injectors, a group at elevated risk for HIV transmission, use syringes manufactured in two styles, one of which (the integral cannula type) retains substantially less blood after intravenous use than the other (the detachable needle type). In this report, we examine some of the factors associated with use of syringes with detachable needles among drug injectors in San Antonio, Texas using data from epidemiological surveys, ethnographic studies, and historical observations. We compare personal history of syringe type use with HIV serostatus in a sample of 501 active drug injectors interviewed and screened for HIV in 1997-1998. Ninety-nine percent of these respondents reported that they currently used only integral cannula syringes, but 13% had used a syringe with a detachable needle within the past 2 years, and 37% had used one in their lifetime. Only 9% had ever used one > or = 20 times in a year. Hispanic (Mexican American) respondents were significantly less likely than other ethnic groups to have ever used a detachable needle syringe. HIV seroprevalence was < 1% among heterosexual injectors who had never used a detachable needle syringe compared to 4% among those who had used one (p<0.05)."
Doc No.716,2640,positive/labeled,8.487988,Immunovirologic characteristics of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients consisting mainly of injecting drug users on highly active antiretroviral treatment with prolonged virologic failure.,"Immunovirologic parameters of 24 heavily antiretroviral drug-pretreated patients with prolonged virologic treatment failure under highly active antiretroviral therapy, and who harbored highly resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates, were studied in this retrospective cross-sectional study. Most of the patients were injecting drug users (71%) and male (88%). All patients were studied for CD4(+) cell count, HIV viral load, resistance mutations, and viral phenotype. The patients showed a high accumulation of resistance-associated mutations, their CD4(+) cell count and viral load directly correlated with their respective values at initiation of therapy, and the presence of K103N was inversely associated with lower viral load. On the other hand, patients with K103N had the same level of CD4(+) cell count compared with patients without this mutation. Among the patients, a majority with a specific viral phenotype was not present. Rather, a dual-tropic virus was found most frequently, suggesting a preferential suppression of X4-specific strains and less cytopathogenicity during antiretroviral therapy and a greater proportion of R5X4 viruses due to an adaptation to that pressure."
Doc No.717,118,negative/unlabeled,8.478532,Impact of hepatitis C on HIV progression in adults with alcohol problems.,Coinfection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a substantial medical and public health concern due to its increasing prevalence and complex patient management. Alcohol use may worsen HCV-related liver disease and interfere with adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and medical care. We therefore studied the association between HCV infection and markers of HIV disease progression in adults with alcohol problems.
Doc No.718,6376,negative/unlabeled,8.478335,Neopterin as a predictive marker for disease progression in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.,"We assessed the value of urinary neopterin concentrations for prognosis of disease progression in HIV-1-infected patients. Sixty-eight anti-HIV-1 seropositive homosexuals with lymphadenopathy syndrome were tested for urinary neopterin and T-cell subset counts in 1982-83, and the incidence rate at which they developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) between then and May 1988 was evaluated. Overall, 21 of 68 (30.9%) cases progressed to AIDS, with a yearly progression rate of 4-9%. The predictive value of urinary neopterin concentrations was higher (P = 0.0042) than that of CD4+ T-cell counts (P = 0.015) or the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio (P = 0.022). Counts of CD8+ T-cells failed to show predictive significance (P = 0.29). Similarly, multivariate-regression analysis indicated that neopterin concentrations and CD4+ T-cell numbers were significant copredictors. Produced by human macrophages activated by interferon gamma, neopterin is thus a marker of macrophage activation via T cells. We conclude that these data demonstrate a correlation between the amount of T-cell-macrophage activation, as measured by urinary neopterin concentrations, and the progression of the disease."
Doc No.719,5289,negative/unlabeled,8.474527,Virus-Like Vesicle-Based Therapeutic Vaccine Vectors for Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection.,"More than 500,000 people die each year from the liver diseases that result from chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Therapeutic vaccines, which aim to elicit an immune response capable of controlling the virus, offer a potential new treatment strategy for chronic hepatitis B. Recently, an evolved, high-titer vaccine platform consisting of Semliki Forest virus RNA replicons that express the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) has been described. This platform generates virus-like vesicles (VLVs) that contain VSV G but no other viral structural proteins. We report here that the evolved VLV vector engineered to additionally express the HBV middle surface envelope glycoprotein (MHBs) induces functional CD8 T cell responses in mice. These responses were greater in magnitude and broader in specificity than those obtained with other immunization strategies, including recombinant protein and DNA. Additionally, a single immunization with VLV-MHBs protected mice from HBV hydrodynamic challenge, and this protection correlated with the elicitation of a CD8 T cell recall response. In contrast to MHBs, a VLV expressing HBV core protein (HBcAg) neither induced a CD8 T cell response in mice nor protected against challenge. Finally, combining DNA and VLV-MHBs immunization led to induction of HBV-specific CD8 T cell responses in a transgenic mouse model of chronic HBV infection. The ability of VLV-MHBs to induce a multispecific T cell response capable of controlling HBV replication, and to generate immune responses in a tolerogenic model of chronic infection, indicates that VLV vaccine platforms may offer a unique strategy for HBV therapeutic vaccination."

Among 330 respondents, 83% were male, 43% were African American, and the median age was 39 years. Negative associations were found between female gender and vitality as well as physical functioning; older age and physical functioning; drug use or drug treatment and role-emotional, social functioning, body pain, as well as vitality; health care utilization and depression with all scales. It appeared that depression and drug-related variables were associated with multiple dimensions of health status in this population. Interventions to treat depression and addiction may improve the health status of HIV-infected HMH."
Doc No.721,1527,negative/unlabeled,8.473491,HIV DNA subspecies persist in both activated and resting memory CD4+ T cells during antiretroviral therapy.,"The latent HIV reservoir is a major impediment to curing HIV infection. The contribution of CD4(+) T cell activation status to the establishment and maintenance of the latent reservoir was investigated by enumerating viral DNA components in a cohort of 12 individuals commencing antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing raltegravir, an integrase inhibitor. Prior to ART, the levels of total HIV DNA were similar across HLA-DR(+) and HLA-DR(-) (HLA-DR(±)) CD38(±) memory CD4(+) T cell phenotypes; episomal two-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) HIV DNA levels were higher in resting (HLA-DR(-) CD38(-)) cells, and this phenotype exhibited a significantly higher ratio of 2-LTR to integrated HIV DNA (P = 0.002). After 1 year of ART, there were no significant differences across each of the memory phenotypes of any HIV DNA component. The decay dynamics of integrated HIV DNA were slow within each subset, and integrated HIV DNA in the resting HLA-DR(-) CD38(-) subset per mm(3) of peripheral blood exhibited no significant decay (half-life of 25 years). Episomal 2-LTR HIV DNA decayed relative to integrated HIV DNA in resting cells with a half-life of 134 days. Surprisingly, from week 12 on, the decay rates of both total and episomal HIV DNA were lower in activated CD38(+) cells. By weeks 24 and 52, HIV RNA levels in plasma were most significantly correlated with the numbers of resting cells containing integrated HIV DNA. On the other hand, total HIV DNA levels in all subsets were significantly correlated with the numbers of HLA-DR(+) CD38(-) cells containing integrated HIV DNA. These results provide insights into the interrelatedness of cell activation and reservoir maintenance, with implications for the design of therapeutic strategies targeting HIV persistence."
Doc No.722,1864,negative/unlabeled,8.47299,Defective regulation of Epstein-Barr virus infection in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related disorders.,"Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) acquire undifferentiated B-cell lymphomas that are similar to African Burkitt's lymphoma and contain Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Using an in vitro assay system that measures a complex of cellular responses to EBV-infected lymphocytes, we found that B cells from 7 patients with AIDS and from 10 patients with AIDS-related disorders produced abnormally low numbers of immunoglobulin-secreting cells (P less than 0.001 as compared with normal controls) and that T-cell suppression, which was greater than 80 percent in EBV-seropositive normal controls, was absent. Instead, the patients' T cells markedly increased immunoglobulin production induced by EBV. In further studies, we determined that the mean frequency of circulating EBV-infected B cells capable of spontaneous outgrowth in vitro was 13 per 10(6) B cells in 7 patients with AIDS and 21 per 10(6) B cells in 10 patients with AIDS-related disorders--figures that were significantly higher than the mean in normal controls (P less than 0.001). Thus, patients with AIDS or AIDS-related disorders may be predisposed to the development of EBV-containing lymphomas, because they have a profound defect of T-cell immunity to EBV and abnormally high numbers of EBV-infected B cells in the circulation."
Doc No.723,4382,negative/unlabeled,8.465428,Grossly defective nef gene sequences in a human immunodeficiency virus type 1-seropositive long-term nonprogressor.,"We have been investigating a long-term nonprogressor who was found to be human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositive in 1985 and has survived with stable CD4+ T-cell counts (>1,000 CD4 cells/microl) without any AIDS-related illness. We have previously reported that repeated attempts to measure HIV-1 RNA in the peripheral mononuclear cells obtained from this subject have invariably failed. In the present study, we have analyzed the molecular nature of the HIV-1 quasispecies infecting this patient by PCR amplification of two proviral regions, the 5' long terminal repeat (5'LTR)/gag leader and the nef gene, directly from fresh uncultured peripheral mononuclear cells, followed by length polymorphism analysis (with 1994, 1995, and 1996 samples) and sequencing (with a 1996 sample). Only proviral forms with nef deletions were revealed by length polymorphism analysis in samples from all three time points. Sequence analysis of the nef gene from the 1996 sample confirmed the presence of similar proviral quasispecies characterized by the presence of several deletions located in the nef-alone and the nef/U3 overlapping regions. Length polymorphism analysis of the 5'LTR/gag leader region suggested the existence of two major quasispecies populations, one characterized by the presence of forms carrying deletions in the U3 region and the other showing a completely intact, full-length 5'LTR. Evidence of the role of nef gene defects in long-term survival of HIV-1-infected patients has been provided so far in two independent investigations involving patients infected with HIV through blood transfusion. Here we show the existence of a similar condition in a subject who acquired HIV-1 seropositivity through the sexual route."
Doc No.724,9043,negative/unlabeled,8.46534,Recombinant interleukin 4 stimulates human immunodeficiency virus production by infected monocytes and macrophages.,"Recombinant interleukin 4 (IL-4) stimulated extracellular (EC) and intracellular (IC) production of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from infected human blood-derived monocytes and macrophages when incubated with the cells after but not before virus inoculation. Significant stimulation was observed in 20 of 27 experiments with monocytes (inoculated with HIV immediately after adherence) and 10 of 13 experiments with macrophages (inoculated after 5 days adherence) using a total of 30 normal donors of monocytes and macrophages, and 11 recent isolates of monocytotropic HIV strains (after one passage in mononuclear cells). Marked increases in EC and IC HIV antigen were observed in some experiments, which were comparable with the maximal stimulatory effects of other cytokines such as IL-2. IL-4 also had similar effects on infectious HIV concentration as measured by reverse transcriptase and TCID50 assays. Antibody to IL-4 prevented the stimulatory effect of the cytokine. The proportion of monocytes and macrophages infected by HIV, as determined by in situ hybridization, also increased after incubation with IL-4 for 7 days. The most marked effects were observed with HIV-infected macrophages, for which the proportion of unstimulated infected cells was lower (35 to 45% increasing to 66 to 70% with IL-4 treatment). There was also an increased proportion of cells with high granule concentrations, suggesting that IL-4 increases the intracellular concentration of viral nucleic acids. This was supported by semi-quantitative hybridization experiments showing that total HIV RNA increased in IL-4-stimulated monocytes 48 to 96 h after HIV inoculation. A marked increase in aggregates was observed on day 7 in HIV-infected monocytes treated with IL-4, compared to that in HIV-infected cells alone or IL-4-treated uninfected monocytes. These findings suggest that IL-4 stimulates HIV replication in the early phases of infection and may also facilitate virus transmission by aggregate formation."
Doc No.725,8703,negative/unlabeled,8.464312,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nucleocapsid zn(2+) fingers are required for efficient reverse transcription, initial integration processes, and protection of newly synthesized viral DNA.","Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) containing mutations in the nucleocapsid (NC) Zn(2+) finger domains have greatly reduced infectivity, even though genome packaging is largely unaffected in certain cases. To examine replication defects, viral DNA (vDNA) was isolated from cells infected with viruses containing His-to-Cys changes in their Zn(2+) fingers (NC(H23C) and NC(H44C)), an integrase mutant (IN(D116N)), a double mutant (NC(H23C)/IN(D116N)), or wild-type HIV-1. In vitro assays have established potential roles for NC in reverse transcription and integration. In vivo results for these processes were obtained by quantitative PCR, cloning of PCR products, and comparison of the quantity and composition of vDNA generated at discrete points during reverse transcription. Quantitative analysis of the reverse transcription intermediates for these species strongly suggests decreased stability of the DNA produced. Both Zn(2+) finger mutants appear to be defective in DNA synthesis, with the minus- and plus-strand transfer processes being affected while interior portions of the vDNA remain more intact. Sequences obtained from PCR amplification and cloning of 2-LTR circle junction fragments revealed that the NC mutants had a phenotype similar to the IN mutant; removal of the terminal CA dinucleotides necessary for integration of the vDNA is disabled by the NC mutations. Thus, the loss of infectivity in these NC mutants in vivo appears to result from defective reverse transcription and integration processes stemming from decreased protection of the full-length vDNA. Finally, these results indicate that the chaperone activity of NC extends from the management of viral RNA through to the full-length vDNA."
Doc No.726,2131,negative/unlabeled,8.452638,Modulation of human immunodeficiency virus 1 replication by interferon regulatory factors.,"Transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 is controlled by the cooperation of virally encoded and host regulatory proteins. The Tat protein is essential for viral replication, however, expression of Tat after virus entry requires HIV-1 promoter activation. A sequence in the 5' HIV-1 LTR, containing a binding site for transcription factors of the interferon regulatory factors (IRF) family has been suggested to be critical for HIV-1 transcription and replication. Here we show that IRF-1 activates HIV-1 LTR transcription in a dose-dependent fashion and in the absence of Tat. This has biological significance since IRF-1 is produced early upon virus entry, both in cell lines and in primary CD4+ T cells, and before expression of Tat. IRF-1 also cooperates with Tat in amplifying virus gene transcription and replication. This cooperation depends upon a physical interaction that is blocked by overexpression of IRF-8, the natural repressor of IRF-1, and, in turn is released by overexpression of IRF-1. These data suggest a key role of IRF-1 in the early phase of viral replication and/or during viral reactivation from latency, when viral transactivators are absent or present at very low levels, and suggest that the interplay between IRF-1 and IRF-8 may play a key role in virus latency."
Doc No.727,9306,negative/unlabeled,8.450824,Medication costs associated with the care of HIV-infected patients.,"The treatment costs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients continue to rise as patients survive longer because of advances in antiretroviral therapy and effective chemoprophylaxis. Medication costs per patient increase in proportion to progressive immunodeficiency. We retrospectively studied medication costs for 196 HIV-infected patients with stratification by CD4-lymphocyte count. Medication costs per patient-month were correlated with CD4-lymphocyte count (linear regression, r = -.53, P < 0.01), with higher costs associated with lower CD4 counts. The medication cost for patients with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3 averaged $1043 per month. Medication costs per patient increase with the development of each new opportunistic infection or other AIDS-associated condition. Costs can be expected to increase as new therapeutic agents are introduced, as treatment is initiated at earlier stages of HIV infection, and as more patients survive to the point of severe CD4-lymphocyte depletion."

Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies with a two-colour direct immunofluorescence method, we found a significant increase in the expression of the V beta 5.3 subfamily in the HIV-positive patient group compared with controls (p less than 0.01). Selected increase in expression of V beta sequences has been described in various autoimmune conditions and our findings raise the possibility that the immunopathological damage from HIV infection may be due to the induction of autoreactivity. If HIV does mimic MHC II, the normal immune response to the virus could represent an autoimmune process similar to graft-versus-host disease."

Doc No.730,8068,negative/unlabeled,8.442551,Remarkable lethal G-to-A mutations in vif-proficient HIV-1 provirus by individual APOBEC3 proteins in humanized mice.,"Genomic hypermutation of RNA viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), can be provoked by intrinsic and extrinsic pressures, which lead to the inhibition of viral replication and/or the progression of viral diversity. Human APOBEC3G was identified as an HIV-1 restriction factor, which edits nascent HIV-1 DNA by inducing G-to-A hypermutations and debilitates the infectivity of vif-deficient HIV-1. On the other hand, HIV-1 Vif protein has the robust potential to degrade APOBEC3G protein. Although subsequent investigations have revealed that lines of APOBEC3 family proteins have the capacity to mutate HIV-1 DNA, it remains unclear whether these endogenous APOBEC3s, including APOBEC3G, contribute to mutations of vif-proficient HIV-1 provirus in vivo and, if so, what is the significance of these mutations. In this study, we use a human hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse (NOG-hCD34 mouse) model and demonstrate the predominant accumulation of G-to-A mutations in vif-proficient HIV-1 provirus displaying characteristics of APOBEC3-mediated mutagenesis. Notably, the APOBEC3-associated G-to-A mutation of HIV-1 DNA that leads to the termination of translation was significantly observed. We further provide a novel insight suggesting that HIV-1 G-to-A hypermutation is independently induced by individual APOBEC3 proteins. In contrast to the prominent mutation in intracellular proviral DNA, viral RNA in plasma possessed fewer G-to-A mutations. Taken together, these results provide the evidence indicating that endogenous APOBEC3s are associated with G-to-A mutation of HIV-1 provirus in vivo, which can result in the abrogation of HIV-1 infection."
Doc No.731,9388,positive/labeled,8.440511,Hepatic compartmentalization of exhausted and regulatory cells in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients.,"Accelerated intrahepatic hepatitis C virus (HCV) pathogenesis is likely the result of dysregulation within both the innate and adaptive immune compartments, but the exact contribution of peripheral blood and liver lymphocyte subsets remains unclear. Prolonged activation and expansion of immunoregulatory cells have been thought to play a role. We determined immune cell subset frequency in contemporaneous liver and peripheral blood samples from chronic HCV-infected and HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and biopsy-derived liver-infiltrating lymphocytes from 26 HIV/HCV-coinfected, 10 chronic HCV-infected and 10 HIV-infected individuals were assessed for various subsets of T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cell, natural killer (NK) cell and NK T-cell frequency by flow cytometry. CD8(+) T cells expressing the exhaustion marker PD-1 were increased in HCV-infected individuals compared with uninfected individuals (P = 0.02), and HIV coinfection enhanced this effect (P = 0.005). In the liver, regulatory CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T cells, as well as CD4(+) CD25(+) PD1(+) T cells, were more frequent in HIV/HCV-coinfected than in HCV-monoinfected samples (P < 0.001). HCV was associated with increased regulatory T cells, PD-1(+) T cells and decreased memory B cells, regardless of HIV infection (P ≤ 0.005 for all). Low CD8(+) expression was observed only in PD-1(+) CD8(+) T cells from HCV-infected individuals and healthy controls (P = 0.002) and was associated with enhanced expansion of exhausted CD8(+) T cells when exposed in vitro to PHA or CMV peptides. In conclusion, in HIV/HCV coinfection, ongoing HCV replication is associated with increased regulatory and exhausted T cells in the periphery and liver that may impact control of HCV. Simultaneous characterization of liver and peripheral blood highlights the disproportionate intrahepatic compartmentalization of immunoregulatory T cells, which may contribute to establishment of chronicity and hepatic fibrogenesis in HIV coinfection."

We have found that Chinese hamster ovary cell-derived human recombinant (hr) IL-10 inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strains Ada and Ba-L (HIV-1ADA and HIV-1Ba-L) replication in primary tissue culture-derived macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition by IL-10 treatment (> 5 U/ml) was effective 72 h before or 24 h after infection and cytokine activity blocked by anti-hrIL-10 antibody (19F1), or lost after heat inactivation of IL-10. Viral production was measured by determining p24 and reverse transcriptase levels while reverse transcription kinetics for the long terminal repeat (LTR) and gag were assessed at timed intervals after infection and quantified by 32P end-labelling. IL-10 inhibited early steps of infection without modulating cell surface CD4+ levels. The onset of LTR reverse transcription was delayed by 4 to 8 h and the number of LTR transcripts was decreased by 77% at 24 h and by 87% 48 h after infection. IL-10 effects were reversible; after cytokine washout, cells treated before infection showed lower levels of virus compared with those treated after infection. IL-10 biological activity was confirmed in three virus-independent assays. These results demonstrate IL-10 decreases HIV-1 reverse transcription upon macrophage infection and subsequently mediates viral latency in vitro. Therefore, IL-10 may be involved in the effective control of HIV-1-infected macrophages in vivo."
Doc No.733,6517,positive/labeled,8.437813,Changes in CCR5 and CXCR4 expression and beta-chemokine production in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy.,"The effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 HIV coreceptors and the production of the beta-chemokines regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, and MIP-1beta has been investigated in 30 HIV-1-infected individuals during 12-36 months of therapy. CCR5 expression was increased in both CD4 + and CD8 + subsets, whereas CXCR4 expression was upregulated only in CD4 + cells. CCR5 levels normalized during 36 months of therapy and positively correlated with the levels of memory, CD95 +, and HLA-DR + T cells. In contrast, the frequency of CXCR4-expressing cells was not significantly modified by HAART, although a downregulation was observed early after starting treatment. CXCR4 levels were significantly associated with the frequencies of naive T cells and negatively correlated with plasma viral load, CD95, and HLA-DR expression. An increased production of both spontaneous and lectin-induced RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta was found at baseline in HIV-infected individuals. The spontaneous beta-chemokines production was not modified by 12 months of HAART, although a significant reduction was seen during the first months of therapy. A transient decrease of lectin-stimulated RANTES production was also observed, whereas the reduction of lectin-induced MIP-1alpha persisted for up to 12 months of therapy. In contrast, MIP-1beta secreted by phytohemagglutinin antigen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells progressively increased during HAART. In conclusion, our data indicate a normalization of CCR5 but not CXCR4 expression during suppressive therapy and changes in beta-chemokine production that may play a part in dictating the efficiency of viral infection and consequently the disease course."

We present the largest survey on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resistance among treatment-naïve and experienced patients followed in small, relatively underprivileged cities in Brazil with universal availability to standard of care antiretroviral combinations. Samples were collected between 2004 and 2006 from 95 patients followed in the cities of Saquarema and Santo Antonio de Pádua, state of Rio de Janeiro. A proviral fragment encompassing protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) regions was generated and drug susceptibility level was inferred. Among 50 strains from drug-naïve subjects, one (2%) had intermediate-level resistance to RT inhibitors. Among 38 patients on therapy as of sampling, 28 (73.7%) had plasma viral load (PVL) below detection limit (26 of whom without evidence of resistance mutations) and 11 (28.9%) harbored strains with reduced susceptibility. Only two strains harbored both protease and RT inhibitor mutations. Among seven patients who were off-treatment as of sampling, two (28.5%) harbored strains with reduced susceptibility to RT inhibitors. The relatively high frequency of undetectable PVL among patients on treatment and the overall low prevalence of resistance-associated mutations are reassuring. Continued surveillance, however, is necessary."

The success of HAART is largely dependent on almost 100% adherence to it. In this study our primary aim was to understand from patients' own perspectives and experiences what resulted in them having 100% adherence to HAART. Thus, we purposefully recruited for in-depth interviews 10 participants (7 men and 3 women) with 100% adherence to HAART (>/=6 months previous to the interviews). All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by using Giorgi's phenomenological analysis approach. The following issues emerged from the analysis: readiness to go on HAART; HAART viewed as a life-line; maintenance of 100% adherence related with willingness to live longer and healthier; optimal ongoing patient-physician relationship, better coping and/or lack of perceived side effects; and improvements in clinical condition as well as in CD4 T-cells count and viral load reinforced the motivation to continue 100% adherence. The study findings should be helpful for health professionals caring for HIV-infected individuals on HAART."
Doc No.736,5704,negative/unlabeled,8.4270525,Contribution of recombination to the evolution of human immunodeficiency viruses expressing resistance to antiretroviral treatment.,"Viral recombination has been postulated to play two roles in the development of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) resistance to antiretroviral drugs. First, recombination has the capacity to associate resistance mutations expressed by distinct viruses, thereby contributing to the development of viruses with improved drug resistance. In addition, recombination could preserve diversity in regions outside those subject to strong selective pressure. In this study, we sought direct evidence for the occurrence of these processes in vivo by evaluating clonal virus populations obtained from the same patient before and after a treatment change that, while unsuccessful in controlling viral replication, led to the emergence of viruses expressing a different profile of resistance mutations. Phylogenetic studies supported the conclusion that the genotype arising after the treatment change resulted from the emergence of recombinant viruses carrying previously existing resistance mutations in novel combinations, whereas alternative explanations, including convergent evolution, were not consistent with observed genotypic changes. Despite evidence for a strong loss of genetic diversity in genomic regions coding for the protease and reverse transcriptase, diversity in regions coding for Gag and envelope was considerably higher, and recombination between the emerging viruses expressing the new pattern of resistance mutations and viral quasispecies in the previously dominant population contributed to this preservation of diversity in the envelope gene. These findings emphasize that recombination can participate in the adaptation of HIV to changing selective pressure, both by generating novel combinations of resistance mutations and by maintaining diversity in genomic regions outside those implicated in a selective sweep."

Doc No.738,4440,negative/unlabeled,8.426443,Protective immune responses induced by a non-pathogenic simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) against a challenge of a pathogenic SHIV in monkeys.,"A simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-NM3n containing the human nef, but not the monkey nef, and vpr genes of SIV was inoculated into two cynomolgus monkeys, resulting in systemic infection with a minimum level of transient virus load. In order to study the nature of immune responses associated with the prevention of a pathogenic SHIV, the SHIV-NM3n-inoculated monkeys and three naive monkeys were intravenously challenged with a pathogenic SHIV containing the envelope gene of HIV-1 89.6. After the heterologous virus challenge, all of the SHIV-NM3n-inoculated animals completely avoided the loss of CD4+ T lymphocytes in PBMC as well as lymphoid tissues compared to pathogenic SHIV-injected control animals. The inhibition of CD4+ cell depletion was associated with maintaining the proliferative response of helper T-cells against SIV p27 in the previously nonpathogenic virus-inoculated animals following the pathogenic virus challenge. Furthermore, the decline of CD28+ cells, the increase in CD95+ cells, and the enhancement of in vitro apoptosis in PBMC were inhibited in the non-pathogenic virus-inoculated animals. These results suggest that nonpathogenic SHIV-NM3n infection induces the protection of monkeys from heterologous pathogenic viruses that may be associated with blocking the change in immune responses and the cell loss induced by a pathogenic virus."
Doc No.739,3278,negative/unlabeled,8.42566,CD8(+) T cells in preventing HIV infection and disease.,"The complex interplay between the host immune response and HIV has been the subject of intense research over the last 25 years. HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) CD8 T cells have been of particular interest since they were demonstrated to be temporally associated with reduction in virus load shortly following transmission. Here, we briefly review the phenotypic and functional properties of HIV-specific and SIV-specific CD8 T-cell subsets during HIV infection and consider the influence of viral variation with specific responses that are associated with disease progression or control. The development of an effective HIV/AIDS vaccine combined with existing successful prevention and treatment strategies is essential for preventing new infections. In the context of previous clinical HIV/AIDS vaccine trials, we consider the challenges faced by therapeutic and vaccine strategies designed to elicit effective HIV-specific CD8 T cells."
Doc No.740,10012,negative/unlabeled,8.425531,Comparison of lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood of patients with infectious mononucleosis and human immunodeficiency virus infection: a preliminary report.,"The aim of this study was to analyse the lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected adults to compare them with four patients with acute EBV infection. Lymphocyte subsets in 15 healthy controls, 40 HIV-1-infected adults and 4 EBV-infected patients with infectious mononucleosis were analysed by flow cytometry. The immunophenotyping of HIV-1-infected patients in different stages of disease showed a significant reduction in the percentage and absolute count of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, significantly increased percentage of CD8+ T-lymphocytes, inverted CD4/CD8 ratio and an increase in the expression of activation marker HLA-DR compared to controls. The immuno-phenotyping profiles of HIV and EBV infection share some similarities as they both result in the decreased percentage of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, increased CD8+ T-lymphocytes and an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio. Patients with HIV infection could be distinguished from patients with EBV infection by the absolute lymphocytosis and increased expression of HLA-DR seen in the patients with infectious mononucleosis. In conclusion, both HIV-1 and EBV profoundly change the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood. It is our opinion that flow cytometry could be an aid in the rapid distinguishing of patients with suspected primary HIV-1 infection from those with infectious mononucleosis (before serology data are available)."
Doc No.741,6524,negative/unlabeled,8.417933,Human thioredoxin/adult T cell leukemia-derived factor activates the enhancer binding protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 by thiol redox control mechanism.,"Transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) provirus is activated by a cellular factor, NF kappa B, recognizing the tandemly repeated 10-base-pair sequences, termed the kappa B sequence, present in the enhancer region within the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), which demonstrates specific DNA-protein interaction in vitro, we could demonstrate that reducto-oxidative modulation of NF kappa B dramatically changes its DNA binding activity and that a cellular physiological reducing catalyst, thioredoxin (TRX) also known as adult T cell leukemia derived factor (ADF), fully restored the DNA-binding activity of the oxidized NF kappa B. We also observed that purified TRX/ADF protein could augment gene expression from HIV LTR as demonstrated by transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay. These observations confirmed the previous notion that ADF might be an inducing factor of cellular interleukin-2 receptor alpha subunit (IL-2R alpha) through the kappa B sequence that is a common central cis-regulatory element in both IL-2R alpha and HIV gene expression. These observations indicate that reducto-oxidative regulation (or redox regulation) of a cysteine residue(s) on the NF kappa B molecule might play an important role in its specific DNA interaction and that it might provide a clue to the understanding of a pathway of cellular signal transduction to NF kappa B that is independent from the known pathways involving protein phosphorylation."

Data collected included age group, race/ethnicity, syphilis serologic results and self-admitted drug use. Remnant serum specimens were tested for HIV-1 antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by Western blot. Of 2236 inmates surveyed, 413 (18.5%) were HIV-1 positive. Rates varied by subgroup, and were higher for women than men (25.8 versus 16.1%; odds ratio 1.8; P less than 0.01), for drug users than inmates who denied drug use (25 versus 14%; odds ratio 2.3; P less than 0.01), for intravenous heroin users (43 versus 15% in drug users not using heroin), and for inmates with positive rapid plasma reagin test (RPR) results (34.5 versus 16.1% in RPR-negative inmates). Use of intravenous heroin was most strongly related, by logistic regression, to HIV-1 seropositivity. The results are among the highest found in US inmates, and suggest that there were 12,500 seropositive individuals incarcerated in 1989. This represents approximately 10% of the estimated number of seropositive individuals in NYC. The NYC Correctional System should be viewed as a front-line institution in the fight against AIDS through provision of HIV-related prevention services and clinical care, and drug treatment."
Doc No.743,7496,negative/unlabeled,8.409713,Induction of potent CD8+ T-cell responses by novel biodegradable nanoparticles carrying human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120.,"The mainstream of recent anti-AIDS vaccines is a prime/boost approach with multiple doses of the target DNA of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and recombinant viral vectors. In this study, we have attempted to construct an efficient protein-based vaccine using biodegradable poly(gamma-glutamic acid) (gamma-PGA) nanoparticles (NPs), which are capable of inducing potent cellular immunity. A significant expansion of CD8+ T cells specific to the major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted gp120 epitope was observed in mice intranasally immunized once with gp120-carrying NPs but not with gp120 alone or gp120 together with the B-subunit of cholera toxin. Both the gp120-encapsulating and -immobilizing forms of NPs could induce antigen-specific spleen CD8+ T cells having a functional profile of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Long-lived memory CD8+ T cells could also be elicited. Although a substantial decay in the effector memory T cells was observed over time in the immunized mice, the central memory T cells remained relatively constant from day 30 to day 238 after immunization. Furthermore, the memory CD8+ T cells rapidly expanded with boosting with the same immunogen. In addition, gamma-PGA NPs were found to be a much stronger inducer of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses than nonbiodegradable polystyrene NPs. Thus, gamma-PGA NPs carrying various HIV-1 antigens may have great potential as a novel priming and/or boosting tool in current vaccination regimens for the induction of cellular immune responses."

A retrospective cohort study of representative samples of AIDS patients treated with a NVP-based regimen was performed. A total of 206 adult HIV/AIDS cases with median age (IQR) 33 years (range, 29-38 years), 51% male, treated between January 2004-December 2005, were included. Most (92.2%) of the patients were naïve to antiretroviral drug. The incidence of NVP toxicity was 1.09/100 person-months. The median onset time was 4 weeks post NVP initiation (2.57 weeks for skin toxicity and 12.43 weeks for hepatic toxicity). History of drug allergy and NVP toxicity were significantly associated (p = 0.006), as were sulfamethoxazole allergy and toxicity (p = 0.015). Regarding concomitant medication, concurrent anti-tuberculosis drugs significantly increased the risk of NVP associated liver toxicity (p = 0.001). Therefore, it is important to monitor adverse events from NVP, including liver function tests among HIV/AIDS patients with history of drug allergy, especially against sulfamethoxazole, and those concurrently treated with antituberculosis drugs."

We investigated the relationship between skin lesions and immune function in a retrospective study of 796 Chinese HIV patients with and without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Of the 651 patients who had not received HAART, we found that 531 (81.6%) had apparent skin lesions. The incidence of infectious skin diseases (fungi, viruses, bacteria, spirochetes and parasites) and non-infectious skin diseases (excluding skin cancer) was 68.8% and 34.9%, respectively. Mean CD4(+) T-cell counts and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratios were lower in patients with skin lesions than in patients without lesions (178 ± 96/µl vs. 306 ± 189/µl (p < 0.05) and 0.22 vs. 0.34 (p < 0.01), respectively). Candidiasis (25.8%), eczema (19.2%), nodular prurigo (13.8%), dermatophyte infections (10.6%) and herpes zoster (9.4%) were most common in Chinese patients with HIV. Among the 145 patients who had started HAART, there was a significantly lower prevalence of skin diseases (29.0%), although drug eruptions (12.4%) were more commonly observed. These findings indicate that HAART often reduces the incidence of infectious and non-infectious skin lesions in patients with HIV, but can itself be the cause of drug eruptions."
Doc No.746,2906,negative/unlabeled,8.404229,Transcriptional activation of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat sequences by tumor necrosis factor.,"The recombinant plasmid pBHIV-1 carrying the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), linked to the reported chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene, was introduced into human and rat fibroblasts. Stable transfectants were obtained which were resistant to genetecin and expressed CAT-activity from the HIV-1 LTR. The response to TNF alpha was studied. It was found that, at the optimum concentration of 100 IU/ml in human and 1000 IU/ml in rat fibroblasts, the expression of CAT was stimulated by 2.1 and 2.5-fold respectively. Our findings suggest that TNF-alpha in physiological concentrations can transcriptionally activate the HIV-1 LTR sequences and this may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection."
Doc No.747,8390,negative/unlabeled,8.401855,Excision of HIV-1 proviral DNA by recombinant cell permeable tre-recombinase.,"Over the previous years, comprehensive studies on antiretroviral drugs resulted in the successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) into clinical practice for treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there is still need for new therapeutic approaches, since HAART cannot eradicate HIV-1 from the infected organism and, unfortunately, can be associated with long-term toxicity and the development of drug resistance. In contrast, novel gene therapy strategies may have the potential to reverse the infection by eradicating HIV-1. For example, expression of long terminal repeat (LTR)-specific recombinase (Tre-recombinase) has been shown to result in chromosomal excision of proviral DNA and, in consequence, in the eradication of HIV-1 from infected cell cultures. However, the delivery of Tre-recombinase currently depends on the genetic manipulation of target cells, a process that is complicating such therapeutic approaches and, thus, might be undesirable in a clinical setting. In this report we demonstrate that E.coli expressed Tre-recombinases, tagged either with the protein transduction domain (PTD) from the HIV-1 Tat trans-activator or the translocation motif (TLM) of the Hepatitis B virus PreS2 protein, were able to translocate efficiently into cells and showed significant recombination activity on HIV-1 LTR sequences. Tre activity was observed using episomal and stable integrated reporter constructs in transfected HeLa cells. Furthermore, the TLM-tagged enzyme was able to excise the full-length proviral DNA from chromosomal integration sites of HIV-1-infected HeLa and CEM-SS cells. The presented data confirm Tre-recombinase activity on integrated HIV-1 and provide the basis for the non-genetic transient application of engineered recombinases, which may be a valuable component of future HIV eradication strategies."

CD4+ T cells can be broadly divided phenotypically into ""naive"" [CD45RA+ (2H4+)] and ""memory"" [CD29+ (4B4+) or CD45RO+ (UCHL1+)] cell subpopulations, which represent distinct maturation stages. To determine the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectability of memory and naive CD4+ T-cell subsets in vitro and to determine the in vivo preference of HIV-1 in these subpopulations, we obtained highly purified CD4+ T-cell subsets from normal and HIV-1-infected individuals and studied them by viral cultivation, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and functional assays. Polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated that the memory cell subset of CD4+ T cells is preferentially infected (4- to 10-fold more than naive T cells) by HIV-1 in vitro, and these memory cells are the principal reservoir for HIV-1 within CD4+ T cells obtained from infected individuals. Functional abnormalities attributable to CD4+ T cells in HIV-infected individuals (failure to respond in vitro to soluble antigen or to anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies) were shown to reside primarily within these memory cells. Thus, the present study suggests that the selective functional defects present in the memory CD4+ T-cell subset of HIV-infected individuals may be a direct result of the preferential infection and consequently greater viral burden within these cells."

Cell targeted-nanoART can achieve this and bring drug efficiently to viral reservoirs. However, whether such improvements affect antiretroviral responses remains unknown. To these ends, we tested folic acid (FA)-linked poloxamer407-coated ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (FA-nanoATV/r) nanoparticles for their ability to affect chronic HIV-1 infection in humanized mice. Following three, 100mg/kg FA-nanoATV/r intramuscular injections administered every other week to infected animals, viral RNA was at or below the detection limit, cell-associated HIV-1p24 reduced and CD4+ T cell counts protected. The dosing regimen improved treatment outcomes more than two fold from untargeted nanoATV/r. We posit that these nanoformulations have potential for translation to human use. "

These responses are of low intensity in young infants and are decreased by antiretroviral therapy. In the present study, we report on a recombinant Vaccinia virus (rVV)-based Elispot assay for the detection of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells immediately after isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The rVV-based assay was highly sensitive; 48 out of 50 children had a positive response against the rVV encoding HIV Env-Gag-Pol antigen. Interferon-gamma was produced by CD8+ T cells, and CD14+/15+ cells were the main cell subset presenting antigens expressed by rVV. We observed that the cell input per well had a critical influence on the sensitivity of the assay. Results from the ex vivo Elispot assay correlated poorly with those of the 51Cr release assay performed after expansion of PBMC in vitro; thus, both assays gave information on different subsets and/or functions of the HIV-specific T cell response."
Doc No.751,2234,negative/unlabeled,8.39193,[Reactive arthritis in HIV-infected patients: immunopathogenic aspects].,Reactive arthritis ReA is still an incompletely understood rheumatic disorder whose immunopathogeny involves several mechanisms. There is an association with Class-I histocompatibility antigens HLA-B27 and history of previous gastrointestinal or genitourinary infections. The molecular mimicry between bacterial and self antigens suggests the possibility of cross reactivity as a disease mechanism. The infection pandemics by the human immunodeficiency virus HIV changed the profile of the occurrence of a number of rheumatic diseases including ReA which appears to be more frequent more severe and refractory to the usual treatment for retrovirus-infected patients. The intensity of articular and extra-articular manifestations of ReA often makes the use of immunosuppressant drugs in these patients necessary. Due to the immunosuppression resulting from the retrovirosis itself the treatment becomes a dilemma for rheumatologists. HIV seems to play a role in the main ReA immunopathogenesis mechanisms either acting as direct arthritogenic agent or causing an immune dysfunction in the CD4 T lymphocytes T CD8 relationship leading to the deregulation in the production of cytokines or in advanced immunosuppression stages predisposing to infection by other arthritogenic pathogens. The use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy HAART has changed the profile of rheumatic events and the immunopathogeny of the HIV ReA association. The understanding of the basic ReA immunopathogenic mechanisms in HIV-infected patients is vital in the attempt of elucidating many still existing questions.

Of these patients, 23% reported crack use, and blacks and women were more likely to use crack. Of crack users 19% were HIV positive, in comparison to 8% of non-users (OR = 2.9, P = 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, the association was no longer significant (OR = 1.4, P = 0.14). Independent behavioral predictors of HIV seropositivity were number of sexual partners, and intravenous cocaine use among blacks.

This study assessed predictors of inpatient hospital admissions for BBVIs in a cohort of 4817 clients seeking treatment for drug use in Finland. We examined clients' data on hospital admissions registered in the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Register from 1997 to 2010 with diagnoses of BBVIs. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were separately conducted for each of the three BBVI groups to test for association between baseline variables and hospitalizations. Findings were reported as adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). Based upon primary discharge diagnoses, 81 clients were hospitalized for HIV, 116 for hepatitis C, and 45 for other types of hepatitis. Compared to those admitted for hepatitis C and other hepatitis, drug users with HIV had higher total number of hospital admissions (294 versus 141 and 50 respectively), higher crude hospitalization rate (7.1 versus 3.4.and 1.2 per 1000 person-years respectively), and higher total length of hospital stay (2857 days versus 279 and 308 respectively). Trends in hospitalization for all BBVI groups declined at the end of follow-up. HIV positive status at baseline (aHR: 6.58) and longer duration of drug use (aHR: 1.11) were independently associated with increased risk for HIV hospitalization. Female gender (aHR: 3.05) and intravenous use of primary drug (aHR: 2.78) were significantly associated with HCV hospitalization. Having hepatitis B negative status at baseline (aHR: 0.25) reduced the risk of other hepatitis hospitalizations. Illicit drug use coexists with blood-borne viral infections. To address this problem, clinicians treating infectious diseases need to also identify drug use in their patients and provide drug treatment information and/or referral. "

Widespread implementation of these recommendations, together with increased use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and scheduled cesarean delivery, has resulted in substantial declines in perinatal HIV transmission. However, perinatal HIV transmission continues to occur. To identify missed prevention opportunities, CDC analyzed the incidence of perinatal HIV infection among a cohort of HIV-exposed infants born during 1997-2000 at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, Georgia. This report describes the results of that analysis and underscores the challenges to universal prevention of infant HIV infections. Efforts to reduce perinatal HIV transmission should focus on increasing prenatal care rates, promoting adherence to recommended treatment regimens during pregnancy, and increasing prenatal HIV testing, particularly in areas where missed opportunities for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission persist."

ENF binds the HR1 domain in gp41 after Env has bound CD4, preventing conformational changes needed for membrane fusion. Mutations in HR1 that confer ENF resistance can arise following ENF therapy. ENF resistance mutations were introduced into an R5- and X4-tropic Env to examine their impact on fusion, infection, and sensitivity to different classes of entry inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies. HR1 mutations could reduce infection and fusion efficiency and also delay fusion kinetics, likely accounting for their negative impact on viral fitness. HR1 mutations had minimal effect on virus sensitivity to other classes of entry inhibitors, including those targeting CD4 binding (BMS-806 and a CD4-specific monoclonal antibody [MAb]), coreceptor binding (CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 and CCR5 inhibitor TAK-779), or fusion (T-1249), indicating that ENF-resistant viruses can remain sensitive to other entry inhibitors in vivo. Some HR1 mutations conferred increased sensitivity to a subset of neutralizing MAbs that likely target fusion intermediates or with epitopes preferentially exposed following receptor interactions (17b, 48D, 2F5, 4E10, and IgGb12), as well as sera from some HIV-positive individuals. Mechanistically, enhanced neutralization correlated with reduced fusion kinetics, indicating that, in addition to steric constraints, kinetics may also limit virus neutralization by some antibodies. Therefore, escape from ENF comes at a cost to viral fitness and may confer enhanced sensitivity to humoral immunity due to prolonged exposure of epitopes that are not readily accessible in the native Env trimer. Resistance to other entry inhibitors was not observed."
Doc No.756,9209,negative/unlabeled,8.380343,Challenges to HIV management among youth engaged in HIV care.,"Regardless of medical advancements, new HIV infections persist. Young adults are most often newly infected, thus research is needed to assess medication adherence barriers specific to young adults with HIV. The data were abstracted from medical charts to include both self-reported behavioral and psychological distress data and HIV parameters in 2013 among patients aged 18-30 years. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors related to viral suppression and sexually transmitted infection (STI) status. A total of 335 individuals presented for care during a 12-month period at a single clinic. The majority were African American and had a mean age of 25.6 years. Nearly all had current prescriptions of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Among those receiving ART, almost three-quarters were virally suppressed, as measured by 200 copies/mL. STI tests are conducted annually and by assessed need; 30% of this sample had at least 1 bacterial STI diagnosis within the last year. Psychological distress symptoms were more common among individuals who were not virally suppressed, compared to those who were virally suppressed. Women and individuals with moderate to severe symptoms of depression had higher odds of having unsuppressed viral loads. The independent factors associated with having any STIs were being African American or other minorities and having two or more sex partners. Our findings related to how young adults are managing their HIV care suggest that increased efforts aimed to prevent additional STIs and manage psychological distress will likely reduce transmission risks."
Doc No.757,780,negative/unlabeled,8.380184,Efficient entry inhibition of human and nonhuman primate immunodeficiency virus by cell surface-expressed gp41-derived peptides.,"Membrane-anchored C-peptides (for example, maC46) derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp41 effectively inhibit HIV-1 entry in cell lines and primary human CD4+ cells in vitro. Here we evaluated this gene therapy approach in animal models of AIDS. We adapted the HIV gp41-derived maC46 vector construct for use in rhesus monkeys. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV and SHIV) sequence-adapted maC46 peptides, and the original HIV-1-derived maC46 expressed on the surface of established cell lines blocked entry of HIV-1, SIVmac251 and SHIV89.6P. Furthermore, primary rhesus monkey CD4+ T cells expressing HIV sequence-based maC46 peptides were also protected from SIV entry. Depletion of CD8+ T cells from PBMCs enhanced the yield of maC46-transduced CD4+ T cells. Supplementation with interleukin-2 (IL-2) increased transduction efficiency, whereas IL-7 and/or IL-15 provided no additional benefit. Phenotypic analysis showed that maC46-transduced and expanded cells were predominantly central memory CD4+ T cells that expressed low levels of CCR5 and slightly elevated levels of CD62L, beta7-integrin and CXCR4. These findings show that maC46-based cell surface-expressed peptides can efficiently inhibit primate immunodeficiency virus infection, and therefore serve as the basis for evaluation of this gene therapy approach in an animal model for AIDS."

CD3+CD8+CD4- HIV-1 nef-specific CTL become infected with HIV-1 after short-term co-culture with HLA-matched HIV-1-infected CD20+ B lymphoblastoid cells (B-LCL) which are specifically killed. Similar results were observed with an allospecific CD8+ CTL population. In addition, co-culture experiments showed that once infected with HIV-1, these CD8+ CTL could spread the infection further to uninfected CD4+ lymphocytes. In contrast, CD8+ CTL did not become infected with HIV-1 when co-cultured with HLA-mismatched HIV-1-infected B-LCL which are not killed. These observations in vitro could have relevance in peripheral lymphoid organs contributing to the progressive decrease of HIV-specific CD8+ CTL activity that is associated with the progression to AIDS."

To examine consequences of therapy in this setting, clinical information, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels, CD4 cell counts, and protease and reverse transcriptase sequences were determined for consecutive HIV-1-infected outpatients. Of 48 treatment-naive individuals, 11 were started on therapy for HIV-related symptoms; however, 44 (92%) had an RNA level >20,000 copies/mL, a CD4 cell count <500/mm3, or symptoms. Eighteen (51%) of 35 patients on therapy had an RNA level >20,000 copies/mL. Nucleoside-resistance mutations were observed in 21 (68%) of 31 nucleoside-experienced subjects. Protease mutations necessary for high-level protease inhibitor (PI) resistance were present together with permissive mutations in 3 of 10 PI-experienced patients. Inability to identify high-risk individuals and to detect virologic failure may limit the effectiveness of antiretroviral drug programs and may promote the spread of drug resistance where virologic and immunologic monitoring are not available."

The aim of this study was to estimate the rate of transmitted drug resistance among newly diagnosed subjects in Estonia in 2008. Genotypic resistance testing for viral genomic RNA was conducted for 201 subjects tested HIV-positive between 1 April and 30 November 2008. Of 145 genotyped viral strains in newly diagnosed patients, 123 were CRF06_cpx, 2 were subtype A1 and 3 were subtype B; in 17 cases viral sequences revealed recombinant structures similar to CRF06_cpx, subtype A1 and CRF02_AG. Resistance mutations were found in 8 (5.5%) virus strains, and 3 strains were resistant to at least 2 ARV classes. A total of 2.8% of sequences harboured mutations indicating nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance (M41L, M184V, M184I, T215C and T215D), 2.1% non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance (K103N, P225H) and 2.8% protease inhibitor resistance (M46I, L90M). These data suggest the need to extend genotypic HIV-1 drug resistance testing to newly diagnosed HIV-positive subjects to prevent potential ARV treatment failure."
Doc No.761,8807,negative/unlabeled,8.362486,Cellular immune responses associated with occult hepatitis C virus infection of the liver.,"Occult hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a type of recently identified chronic infection that is evidenced only by detection of HCV RNA in liver; patients consistently test negative for antibodies to HCV and HCV RNA in serum. Using ex vivo and in vitro measures of T-cell responses, we have identified functional virus-specific memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with occult HCV infection. The features of the virus-specific T cells were consistent with immune surveillance functions, supporting previous exposure to HCV. In addition, the magnitudes of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses were in parallel and correlated inversely with the extent of liver HCV infection. The detection of HCV-specific T cells in individuals in whom HCV RNA can persist in the liver despite the absence of viremia and antibodies indicates that HCV replication is prolonged in the face of virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses. These findings demonstrate that HCV-specific cellular immune responses are markers not only of previous exposure to and recovery from HCV but also of ongoing occult HCV infection."

Implementation of active antiretroviral (ARV) therapy programs is urgently needed. However this emergency situation must not extenuate the importance of preliminary studies on ARV resistance of African HIV-1 isolates. Findings show that genetic mutations underlying the resistance of African strains are generally identical to those observed in HIV-1 subtype B in industrialized countries. However the incidence of some mutations associated with mild resistance to protease inhibitors (PI) appears higher in African isolates. The potential impact of these mutations for development of frank resistance to PI is still unclear. The incidence of high-grade resistance markers in untreated subjects is low. While these results do not compromise use of ARV therapy in Africa, they underline the need to set up local networks for patient follow-up and to carry out epidemiological surveillance of HIV-1 resistance. Success of ARV therapies in Africa will also depend on economic and social programs."
Doc No.763,107,positive/labeled,8.357254,Strong human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific CD4+ T cell responses in a cohort of chronically infected patients are associated with interruptions in anti-HIV chemotherapy.,"Virus-specific CD4+ T-helper cell function is important in controlling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection but is impaired in patients with progressive HIV disease. It has been reported that after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-specific lymphoproliferative responses remain absent, whereas responses to non-HIV microbial antigens are restored. However, in analyzing immune responses in a cohort of chronically infected adults on HAART, we observed strong HIV-specific CD4+ T cell responses of Th-1 phenotype in 11 of 22 patients. The magnitude and frequency of HIV-specific lymphoproliferative responses was strongly associated with previous interruptions in HAART (P=.001). In contrast, the magnitude of CD8+ T cell responses to HIV Gag, Pol, Env, and Nef was similar in patients who had and those who had not interrupted HAART. We conclude that (1) a significant proportion of chronically HIV-infected patients on HAART can generate strong HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity and (2) transient interruptions in antiviral treatment may prime or boost HIV-specific CD4+ T-helper responses."
Doc No.764,4278,negative/unlabeled,8.35473,Presence of genotypic resistance in nucleoside analogue-treated HIV-1-infected patients with undetectable viral load.,"Patients harbouring drug-resistance viruses usually suffer a rise in serum viraemia after a variable period of time. We have investigated the relationship between the appearance of resistant genotypes and the viral load of each patient after treatment. Our objective was to assess the association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA plasma levels and the number of drug resistance-associated point mutations after treatment. A total of 150 patients from three reference centres in Spain (Madrid, Barcelona and Seville) from a previous study (Erase Study) were included. Patients had at that time undergone antiretroviral treatment with nucleoside analogues for at least 1 year (zidovudine/didanosine; zidovudine/zalcitabine; zidovudine/zalcitabine/lamivudine; zidovudine/didanosine/lamivudine). In this study, plasma viraemia in these patients was quantified and a line probe assay was used to determine the genotype of the virus. Viral load was significantly higher in patients harbouring virus with more than three mutations than in those individuals who harboured wild-type strains (P < 0.05). Surprisingly, when patients with viral load < 500 copies/ml (13/150) were analysed, only two carried wild-type strains, whereas three had virus with more than three point mutations. The viral load of six samples was assayed using an ultrasensitive test (detection limit < 20 copies/ml). Of the three samples where viral load was < 20 copies/ml, one patient harboured wild-type virus, whereas two carried mutant virus strains. These results suggest that even in patients with undetectable viral loads by conventional methods, viral replication may continue and mutations develop. Therefore, standard values of plasma viraemia for measuring the effectiveness of the treatment should be reconsidered when patients are on antiviral regimens of just two or three nucleoside analogues."

Women and Infants Transmission Study.,"To determine if hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 487 HIV-infected pregnant women in the prospective, multicenter, Women and Infants Transmission Study had HCV antibody (anti-HCV by second-generation ELISA) and HCV RNA (by quantitative polymerase chain reaction) measured in peripartum maternal plasma; 161 (33%) were anti-HCV-positive. HIV vertical transmission occurred from 42 HCV-infected mothers (26.1%) versus 53 HCV-uninfected mothers (16.3%; odds radio [OR], 1.82; P = .01). In a logistic regression model that included maternal drug use, a potential confounder, HCV infection was marginally associated with perinatal HIV transmission (OR, 1.64; P = .05), whereas drug use was not. Women who transmitted HIV had higher levels of HCV RNA (median, 721,254 copies/mL) than those who did not (337,561 copies/mL; P = .01). Maternal HCV infection is associated with increased HIV vertical transmission. Further studies are needed to ascertain if HCV directly affects perinatal HIV transmission or is a marker for another factor, such as maternal drug use."

Of 270 participants tested for HTLV-I/II, 21 (8%) were seropositive. Of those, 15 (71%) had HTLV-II-specific sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 1 (5%) had both HTLV-I- and -II-specific sequences; 3 persons with indeterminate serologic results were also PCR-positive for HTLV-II. HTLV-II infection was significantly associated with older age but was not predicted by sex, race, socioeconomic status, transfusion history, or HIV infection status. Behavioral factors since 1978, such as duration and frequency of intravenous drug use, needle sharing, visits to shooting galleries, or number of sex partners, were also not associated with HTLV-II infection. These findings are in contrast with the association of these risk factors with HIV in this group and suggest that, among IVDUs, HTLV-II is an older endemic infection that is less efficiently transmitted than HIV."
Doc No.767,9896,positive/labeled,8.350311,Phenotypic and functional characterization of lymphocytes derived from normal and HIV-1-infected human lymph nodes.,"Lymph nodes are the major site of cell-to-cell transmission and replication of HIV-1. Trafficking of CD4+ T lymphocytes into lymph nodes provides a continual supply of susceptible target lymphocytes, and conversely, recruitment of CD8+ T lymphocytes may be critical for the host response that attempts to control HIV-1 replication. The present study was undertaken as no detailed assessment of lymphocyte subpopulations in HIV-1-infected lymph nodes has previously been reported. Peripheral blood and single-cell suspensions prepared from lymph nodes of patients with HIV-1 and control subjects were analysed using three-colour flow cytometry. Approximately 80% of the lymphocytes in control lymph nodes were CD3+ T lymphocytes, of which over 65% were CD4+. The majority of the CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes obtained from both lymph nodes and blood of control subjects were immunologically naive (CD45RA+). By contrast, in HIV-1-infected patients there was a significant reduction in the proportion of CD4+ T lymphocytes and an expansion of the CD8+ T lymphocyte subset in both lymph nodes and peripheral blood. Furthermore, a high proportion of these T lymphocytes displayed a marker for immunological memory (CD45RO+). T lymphocytes derived from HIV-1-infected lymph nodes also showed altered expression of the adhesion molecules, L-selectin and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), but not leucocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1). In an in vitro adhesion assay, lymphocytes from HIV-1-infected nodes were significantly more adhesive than control lymphocytes on fibronectin, as well as recombinant human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) substrates. This combination of altered lymphocyte subpopulations in the HIV-1-infected lymph nodes, as well as enhanced adhesion phenotype and function, suggests that T lymphocyte traffic to lymph nodes in HIV disease may be an important determinant of pathogenesis."

The six of 39 patients with a serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value of 1-2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) were assigned to the open-label arm (Group01) receiving vaccine monotherapy; the remaining 33 patients with an ALT of more than two times ULN were enroled to the randomized and controlled arm (Group02) receiving lamivudine (LAM) monotherapy (LAM+placebo) or combined therapy (LAM+DNA vaccine) in 1:2 ratio. In Group01, a significant elevation of HBV-specific IFN-γ-secreting T-cell counts in comparison with baseline was observed. In Group02, the proportion of patients with HBV DNA suppression was higher with LAM+DNA vaccine than with LAM monotherapy at each visit time point after the final injection of DNA vaccine at week 36, revealing a significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.03) at week 60. The incidence of dual-site mutations of rtM204/I/S+rtL180M was significantly lower (P = 0.03) with an identified lower virological breakthrough (VBT) rate (P = 0.03) in patients receiving LAM+DNA vaccine than LAM monotherapy, accompanied with a significant higher positive T-cell response rate in patients receiving LAM+DNA vaccine (P = 0.03). In conclusion, this study provides evidence that HBV DNA vaccination is safe and immunologically effective, and that the HBV-specific T-cell responses induced by DNA vaccination under LAM chemotherapy showed a correlation with the suppression of viral replication in patients with CHB."

This study shows that human blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells loaded with liposome-complexed HIV-1 proteins and matured with CD40 ligand can prime CD8(+) T cells to HIV-1 in vitro. Whole HIV-1 protein in liposome may be an effective immunogen for HIV-1 vaccine protocols.

Although the mechanisms underlying this disease resistance are unknown, a consistent feature of natural SIV infection is the absence of the generalized immune activation associated with HIV infection. To define the correlates of preserved CD4(+) T cell counts in SMs, we conducted a cross-sectional immunological study of 110 naturally SIV-infected SMs. The nonpathogenic nature of the infection was confirmed by an average CD4(+) T cell count of 1,076 +/- 589/mm(3) despite chronic infection with a highly replicating virus. No correlation was found between CD4(+) T cell counts and either age (used as a surrogate marker for length of infection) or viremia. The strongest correlates of preserved CD4(+) T cell counts were a low percentage of circulating effector T cells (CD28(-)CD95(+) and/or IL-7R/CD127(-)) and a high percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells. These findings support the hypothesis that the level of immune activation is a key determinant of CD4(+) T cell counts in SIV-infected SMs. Interestingly, we identified 14 animals with CD4(+) T cell counts of <500/mm(3), of which two show severe and persistent CD4(+) T cell depletion (<50/mm(3)). Thus, significant CD4(+) T cell depletion does occasionally follow SIV infection of SMs even in the context of generally low levels of immune activation, lending support to the hypothesis of multifactorial control of CD4(+) T cell homeostasis in this model of infection. The absence of AIDS in these ""CD4(low)"" naturally SIV-infected SMs defines a protective role of the reduced immune activation even in the context of a significant CD4(+) T cell depletion."
Doc No.771,2539,negative/unlabeled,8.341676,Impaired maraviroc and raltegravir clearance in a human immunodeficiency virus-infected patient with end-stage liver disease and renal impairment: a management dilemma.,"Current product labels for maraviroc and raltegravir provide no dosing guidance for patients with end-stage liver disease and worsening renal function. We describe a 41-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and rapidly progressive liver failure and vanishing bile duct syndrome at presentation. Despite discontinuation of all potential offending drugs, the patient's liver function continued to deteriorate. To achieve and maintain HIV suppression while awaiting liver transplantation, a regimen consisting of maraviroc, raltegravir, and enfuvirtide was started. These agents were chosen because the patient was not exposed to them before the onset of liver failure. While receiving product label-recommended twice-daily dosing of these drugs, he achieved and maintained HIV suppression. During a complicated and prolonged hospitalization, the patient also developed renal dysfunction. As hepatic metabolism is the primary route of clearance of maraviroc and raltegravir, we predicted that using approved doses of these drugs could result in significant drug accumulation. Since the safety profiles of supratherapeutic concentrations of these agents are not well defined, we chose to use therapeutic drug monitoring to guide further dosing. The reported concentrations showed severely impaired metabolic clearance of both drugs, with markedly prolonged elimination half-lives of 189 hours for maraviroc and 61 hours for raltegravir. Previously reported half-lives for maraviroc and raltegravir in HIV-infected patients with normal hepatic and renal function are 14-18 hours and 9-12 hours, respectively. Based on these results, the dosing intervals were extended from twice/day to twice/week for maraviroc and every 48 hours for raltegravir. Unfortunately, the patient's clinical condition continued to deteriorate, and he eventually died of complications related to end-stage liver disease. This case illustrates the difficulties in managing antiretroviral therapy in an HIV-infected patient with combined severe liver and renal failure. Prolonged excessively high exposure to maraviroc and raltegravir is likely to result in some level of concentration-dependent toxicity. Until more data are available, therapeutic drug monitoring remains the only evidence-based approach to optimize dosage selection of these drugs in this patient population."
Doc No.772,8336,negative/unlabeled,8.340666,HIV-1 infection of human T lymphocytes results in enhanced alpha 5 beta 1 integrin expression.,"Altered T cell adherence after human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection may contribute to viral pathogenesis in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. To address this hypothesis, we assessed mechanisms of T cell adherence to extracellular matrix proteins in vitro. We found that after HIV-1 infection, both chronically infected H9 CD4+ T cells and acutely infected primary peripheral blood lymphocytes acquired the ability to adhere to the extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin, to a lesser extent to type IV collagen and laminin, but not to type I collagen. H9 cells chronically infected with two of the three HIV-1 strains studied showed approximately a sevenfold increase in attachment to fibronectin, while the same cells infected with the human retrovirus HIV-2 did not. Adhesion was accompanied by changes in morphology, including marked spreading and increased filopodia. These alterations were not blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7, which did inhibit TPA-induced T cell attachment to fibronectin. Monoclonal antibodies against both the alpha 5 and the beta 1 subunits of the classical fibronectin receptor as well as an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide inhibited attachment, whereas anti-alpha 4 monoclonal antibodies and the CS1 peptide did not. Binding to collagen IV was also inhibited by the anti-beta 1 monoclonal antibody, but not the other antibodies. Cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and analyzed by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-beta 1 integrin antibody showed a 2.5-fold increase in integrin synthesis in infected cells compared to uninfected controls. This increase in synthesis was associated with an increase in cell surface expression of both alpha 5 and beta 1 integrins by FACS (registered trademark of Becton Dickinson for a fluorescence-activated cell sorter) analysis. Enhanced expression of integrins such as alpha 5 beta 1 may cause T cell adherence to a variety of tissues, where released viral gene products may induce some of the tissue-specific manifestations of HIV-1 infection."
Doc No.773,198,negative/unlabeled,8.339808,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir and prophylactic efficacy against HIV-1 infection.,"Antiviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) through daily drug administration can protect healthy individuals from HIV-1 infection. While PrEP was recently approved by the FDA, the potential long-term consequences of PrEP implementation remain entirely unclear. The aim of this study is to predict the efficacy of different prophylactic strategies with the pro-drug tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate (TDF) and to assess the sensitivity towards timing- and mode of TDF administration (daily- vs. single dose), adherence and the number of transmitted viruses. We developed a pharmacokinetic model for TDF and its active anabolite tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) and validated it with data from 4 different trials, including 4 distinct dosing regimes. Pharmacokinetics were coupled to an HIV model and viral decay following TDF mono-therapy was predicted, consistent with available data. Subsequently, a stochastic approach was used to estimate the % infections prevented by (i) daily TDF-based PrEP, (ii) one week TDF started either shortly before, or -after viral exposure and (iii) a single dose oral TDF before viral challenge (sd-PrEP). Analytical solutions were derived to assess the relation between intracellular TFV-DP concentrations and prophylactic efficacy. The predicted efficacy of TDF was limited by a slow accumulation of active compound (TFV-DP) and variable TFV-DP half-life and decreased with increasing numbers of transmitted viruses. Once daily TDF-based PrEP yielded [Formula: see text]80% protection, if at least 40% of pills were taken. Sd-PrEP with 300 mg or 600 mg TDF could prevent [Formula: see text]50% infections, when given at least before virus exposure. The efficacy dropped to [Formula: see text]10%, when given 1 h before 24 h exposure. Efficacy could not be increased with increasing dosage or prolonged administration. Post-exposure prophylaxis poorly prevented infection. The use of drugs that accumulate more rapidly, or local application of tenofovir gel may overcome the need for drug administration long before virus exposure."

The present study was aimed at characterizing the ability of DCs generated in the presence of GM-CSF and IFN-alpha to induce CD4 T cell responses. DCs were generated from monocytes of HIV-infected patients in the presence of GM-CSF with either IFN-alpha (IFN-DCs) or IL-4 (IL-4-DCs) for 7 days. Eleven patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy and exhibiting CD4 cell counts above 400/mm(3) and plasma HIV-RNA <50 copies/ml for at least 1 year were included in the study. Both DC populations were found to be defective in inducing autologous (in response to tuberculin or HIV-p24) or allogeneic CD4 T cell proliferation. Neutralization of IL-10 during the differentiation of IFN-DCs, but not during the DC-T cell coculture, significantly increased their ability to stimulate autologous CD4 T cell proliferation in response to tuberculin and allogeneic CD4 T cell proliferation (4.1-fold and 3.0-fold increases, respectively, at the DC to T cell ratio of 1:10). Moreover, IL-10 neutralization and CD4(+)CD25(+) T cell depletion synergistically act to dramatically increase HIV-p24-specific CD4 T cell responses induced by IFN-DCs (31.7-fold increase) but not responses induced by IL-4-DCs. Taken together, our results indicate that IFN-DCs are more efficient than IL-4-DCs to stimulate CD4(+) T cell proliferation, further supporting their use for immune-based therapy in HIV infection."

Overall, we found that 21% of 156 specimens collected from HIV-infected individuals (17.6% from 74 drug-naive patients and 24.4% from 82 pretreated patients) harbored these insertions. Insertions around the KQE (Lys-Gln-Glu) motif were found in 12.2% of the pretreated patients but in none of the drug-naive subjects (P = 0.002). In contrast, insertions around the PTAP (Prol-Thre-Ala-Prol) motif were seen at similar rates ( approximately 15%) among drug-naive and pretreated patients, which supports the idea that they may be natural polymorphisms."

After 2 weeks in the presence of the drug, the percentage of dead CD4(+) cells in HIV-1-infected cultures was comparable to that observed in uninfected cultures, while over the same time interval it increased by three- to fivefold in HIV-1-infected cultures maintained in the absence of AY. AY also stimulated by 2- to 12-fold interleukin-12 (IL-12) and (gamma interferon production. For IL-12, this effect appears to be related to an increase in corresponding IL-12 p35 and IL-12 p40 mRNA levels. Moreover, AY restored the expression of the IL-2 receptor, which was severely impaired in HIV-1-infected PBMCs. Although the drug has no direct antiviral effect (it does not significantly inhibit reverse transcriptase activity measured in vitro), it might be considered a potential therapeutic agent for HIV-infected patients, in that it may correct viral infection-related immune system defects by indirectly enhancing the level of resistance to HIV and opportunistic infections."

Bronchial lavage fluid yielded Pneumocystis carinii. The diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was suspected, although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot tests were both negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Immunologic evaluation included the following results: a low normal CD4/CD8 ratio 0.88, CD4 lymphocytes 493/microL, and elevated IgA 539 mg/dL and IgM 175 mg/dL with normal IgG 492 mg/dL. Lymphocyte stimulation study results were depressed. Lymphocytes sent for culture were subsequently positive for HIV. The mother was HIV antibody positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot but belonged to no high-risk group and was asymptomatic except for chronic diarrhea. The father was HIV antibody negative. The patient was treated with pentamidine and IV gamma-globulin with good clinical response and a rapid decrease of IgM and IgA toward normal values. Subsequent candidal pneumonia and candidal esophagitis were treated successfully with amphotericin B. The patient has received prophylactic IV gamma-globulin infusions for 6 months and remains HIV negative by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. This case of pediatric AIDS highlights the need to consider HIV infection in the differential diagnosis of any child with physical findings or illnesses suggestive of AIDS-related complex or AIDS, even when HIV serologic findings are negative and parents belong to no high-risk group. Parental testing for HIV antibody is suggested in such cases."
Doc No.778,8266,positive/labeled,8.3290415,Health-related quality of life of HIV-infected adults receiving combination antiretroviral therapy in Addis Ababa.,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important outcome measure among HIV-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), but has not been studied extensively in resource-limited settings. Insight in the predictors or correlates of poor HRQoL may be helpful to identify patients most in need of additional support and to design appropriate interventions. A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2012 and April 2013 in 10 healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Patients who were at least 6 months on cART were randomly selected and individual patient data were retrieved from medical records. HRQoL was measured by the WHOQoL-HIVBREF, depressive-symptoms by the Kessler-6 scale, and stigma by the Kalichman internalized AIDS-related stigma scale. Multivariate linear regression analysis was carried-out to examine associations between HRQoL and the other variables. A total of 664 patients (response-rate 95%) participated in the study. A higher level of depressive-symptoms was most strongly and consistently associated with a lower HRQoL, both in terms of the magnitude of the relationship and in the number of HRQoL domains associated with it. Also, a higher level of HIV-stigma was associated with a lower HRQoL except for the physical domain, while obtaining sufficient nutritious food and job opportunity were associated with a better HRQoL except for the spiritual and social domains, respectively. Demographics, clinical, and treatment characteristics yielded few significant associations with HRQoL. Our study findings suggest that interventions to improve HRQoL should focus on reducing depressive-symptoms and HIV-stigma, and on enhancing food security and job opportunity. "
Doc No.779,1277,negative/unlabeled,8.328246,Effects of prostratin on T-cell activation and human immunodeficiency virus latency.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication is linked to cellular gene transcription and requires target cell activation. The latent reservoir of HIV-1 in quiescent T cells is thought to be a major obstacle to clearance of infection by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Thus, identification of agents that can induce expression of latent virus may, in the presence of HAART, allow elimination of the infected cells by the immune response. We previously used the SCID-hu (Thy/Liv) mouse model to establish that activation-inducible HIV can be generated at high frequency during thymopoiesis. Latently infected mature thymocytes can be exported into the periphery, providing an efficient primary cell model to determine cellular activation signals that induce renewed expression of latent virus. Here we characterized the effects of prostratin, a non-tumor-promoting phorbol ester, on primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and assessed its ability to reactivate latent HIV infection from thymocytes and PBLs in the SCID-hu (Thy/Liv) model. Prostratin stimulation alone did not induce proliferation of quiescent PBLs; however, it could provide a secondary signal in the context of T-cell receptor stimulation or a primary activation signal in the presence of CD28 stimulation to induce T-cell proliferation. While prostratin alone was not sufficient to allow de novo HIV infection, it efficiently reactivated HIV expression from latently infected cells generated in the SCID-hu mouse. Our data indicate that prostratin alone is able to specifically reactivate latent virus in the absence of cellular proliferation, making it an attractive candidate for further study as an adjunctive therapy for the elimination of the latent HIV reservoir."
Doc No.780,3482,negative/unlabeled,8.32314,Tissue-associated cytokine expression in HIV-positive persons with oropharyngeal candidiasis.,"Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), caused by Candida albicans, is the most common infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive persons. Although CD4(+) T cells are considered to be important for host defense against C. albicans at the oral mucosa, a recent immunohistochemical evaluation of T cells in OPC lesions of HIV-positive persons with reduced CD4(+) T cells showed high numbers of CD8(+) T cells. The present study investigated tissue-associated expression of cytokine and chemokine mRNA at the site of infection. Results showed some effects of HIV (primarily increased chemokine mRNA levels) but little effect of blood CD4(+) T cells. In contrast, mRNA for several proinflammatory, T helper, and CD8(+) T cell-associated cytokines and chemokines were increased in subjects with OPC versus those without. These results support the presence of CD8(+) T cells in OPC lesions and suggest evidence for a response against OPC, despite reduced levels of CD4(+) T cells."
Doc No.781,7675,negative/unlabeled,8.322858,Role of minority populations of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in the evolution of viral resistance to protease inhibitors.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance results from the accumulation of mutations in the viral genes targeted by the drugs. These genetic changes, however, are commonly detected and monitored by techniques that only take into account the dominant population of plasma virus. Because HIV-1-infected patients harbor a complex and diverse mixture of virus populations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence and the evolution of resistance are not fully elucidated. Using techniques that allow the quantification of resistance mutations in minority virus species, we have monitored the evolution of resistance in plasma virus populations from patients failing protease inhibitor treatment. Minority populations with distinct resistance genotypes were detected in all patients throughout the evolution of resistance. The emergence of new dominant genotypes followed two possible mechanisms: (i) emergence of a new mutation in a currently dominant genotype and (ii) emergence of a new genotype derived from a minority virus species. In most cases, these population changes were associated with an increase in resistance at the expense of a reduction in replication capacity. Our findings provide a preliminary indication that minority viral species, which evolve independently of the majority virus population, can eventually become dominant populations, thereby serving as a reservoir of diversity and possibly accelerating the development of drug resistance."
Doc No.782,6725,negative/unlabeled,8.318812,Escape from the dominant HLA-B27-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response in Gag is associated with a dramatic reduction in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication.,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27-positive subjects are uncommon in their ability to control infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, late viral escape from a narrowly directed immunodominant Gag-specific CD8(+) T-lymphocyte (CTL) response has been linked to AIDS progression in these individuals. Identifying the mechanism of the immune-mediated control may provide critical insights into HIV-1 vaccine development. Here, we illustrate that the CTL escape mutation R(264)K in the HLA-B27-restricted KK10 epitope in the capsid resulted in a significant defect in viral replication in vitro. The R(264)K variant was impaired in generating late reverse transcription products, indicating that replication was blocked at a postentry step. Notably, the R(264)K mutation was associated in vivo with the development of a rare secondary mutation, S(173)A, which restored viral replication in vitro. Furthermore, infectivity of the R(264)K variant was rescued by the addition of cyclosporine A or infection of a cyclophilin A-deficient cell line. These data demonstrate a severe functional defect imposed by the R(264)K mutation during an early step in viral replication that is likely due to the inability of this variant to replicate efficiently in the presence of normal levels of cyclophilin A. We conclude that the impact of the R(264)K substitution on capsid structure constrains viral escape and enables long-term maintenance of the dominant CTL response against B27-KK10, providing an explanation for the protective effect of HLA-B27 during HIV infection."

We studied patterns and accrual of drug resistance mutations in a Cambodian CRF01_AE-infected cohort continuing a virologically failing first-line, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor- (NNRTI-) based, HAART. Between 2005 and 2007, 837 adult HIV-infected patients had regular plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load measurements at Sihanouk Hospital Centre of Hope (SHCH), Cambodia. Drug resistance testing was performed in all patients with HIV-1 RNA >1000 copies/ml after at least 6 months of HAART. Seventy-one patients with a mean age of 34 years, of whom 68% were male, were retrospectively assessed at virological failure. The median duration of antiretroviral therapy was 12.3 (IQR 7.1-18.23) months, the median CD4 cell count was 173 (IQR 118-256) cells/mm(3), and the mean plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 3.9 log (SD 0.72) at failure. NNRTI mutations, M184I/V mutation, thymidine analogue mutations, and K65R were observed in 78.9%, 69%, 20%, and 12.7% of patients, respectively. For 33 patients, genotypic testing was carried out on at least two occasions before the switch to second-line HAART after a median duration of 5.8 (IQR 4.3-6.1) months of virological failure: 54.5% of patients accumulated new mutations with a rate of 1.6 mutations per person-year. Accumulation was seen both for nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and also in patients with low-level viremia. Subtype-specific data on mutation type, rate, and accumulation after HAART failure are urgently needed to optimize treatment strategies in resource-limited settings."
Doc No.784,3462,negative/unlabeled,8.305206,Targeting of conserved gag-epitopes in early HIV infection is associated with lower plasma viral load and slower CD4(+) T cell depletion.,"We aimed to investigate whether the character of the immunodominant HIV-Gag peptide (variable or conserved) targeted by CD8(+) T cells in early HIV infection would influence the quality and quantity of T cell responses, and whether this would affect the rate of disease progression. Treatment-naive HIV-infected study subjects within the OPTIONS cohort at the University of California, San Francisco, were monitored from an estimated 44 days postinfection for up to 6 years. CD8(+) T cells responses targeting HLA-matched HIV-Gag-epitopes were identified and characterized by multicolor flow cytometry. The autologous HIV gag sequences were obtained. We demonstrate that patients targeting a conserved HIV-Gag-epitope in early infection maintained their epitope-specific CD8(+) T cell response throughout the study period. Patients targeting a variable epitope showed decreased immune responses over time, although there was no limitation of the functional profile, and they were likely to target additional variable epitopes. Maintained immune responses to conserved epitopes were associated with no or limited sequence evolution within the targeted epitope. Patients with immune responses targeting conserved epitopes had a significantly lower median viral load over time compared to patients with responses targeting a variable epitope (0.63 log(10) difference). Furthermore, the rate of CD4(+) T cell decline was slower for subjects targeting a conserved epitope (0.85% per month) compared to subjects targeting a variable epitope (1.85% per month). Previous studies have shown that targeting of antigens based on specific HLA types is associated with a better disease course. In this study we show that categorizing epitopes based on their variability is associated with clinical outcome."

However, few data exist on the recent epidemiology, predictors and outcomes of CDI in LTR. A cohort study was performed including LTR from 2000 to 2010 at a tertiary care hospital in Detroit. CDI was defined as diarrhea with a stool C. difficile positive test. Data analyzed included demographics, comorbidities, length of stay (LOS), severity of CDI, rates of recurrence (<12 weeks), relapse (<4 weeks) and overall mortality. Predictors of CDI were calculated using Cox proportional hazard model; 970 LTR were followed for years. Overall prevalence of CDI was 18.9%. Incidence of CDI within 1 year of transplant was 12.4%. Severe CDI occurred in 29.1%. CDI recurrence and relapse rates were 16.9% and 9.7%, respectively. Independent predictors of CDI were year of transplant (hazard ratio [HR] 1.137, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.22; p < 0.001), white race (105/162 whites, HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03-2.1; p = 0.035), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.045, p = 0.003) and LOS (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.005-1.02, p < 0.001). Significant mortality was observed among LTR with CDI compared to those without CDI (p = 0.003). We concluded that CDI is common among LTR and is associated with higher mortality. "

We confirmed that IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) responses to HCV are poor in HCV patients and showed that responses to HCV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigens decrease during therapy. This was most apparent in patients with sustained virological response (SVR). Baseline frequencies of CD4+ effector memory (TEM) T cells were lower in SVR than non-SVR. Proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ TEM and terminally differentiated effector memory (TEMRA) T cells declined on therapy in SVR, as did proportions of Fas+ CD8+ TEMRA T cells. Baseline frequencies of programmed death (PD)-1-expressing CD4+ TEM and TEMRA T-cells were higher in SVR. Therapy increased percentages of PD-1+ CD4+ central memory (TCM) T cells and PD-1+ CD8+ TEM and TEMRA T cells in SVR. We conclude that successful therapy depletes circulating antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses. This paralleled decreases in proportions of effector memory T cells and higher percentages of CD4+ TCM T cells expressing PD-1."

Intra-familial transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) could be the reason for the familial clustering of HBsAg carriers. Additionally, genetic and gender factors have been reported to be involved. We conducted a three-stage genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors associated with chronic HBV susceptibility. A total of 1,065 male controls and 1,623 male HBsAg carriers were included. The whole-genome genotyping was done on Illumina HumanHap550 beadchips in 304 healthy controls and HumanHap610 beadchips in 321 cases. We found that rs9277535 (HLA-DPB1, P = 4.87×10(-14)), rs9276370 (HLA-DQA2, P = 1.9×10(-12)), rs7756516 and rs7453920 (HLA-DQB2, P = 1.48×10(-11) and P = 6.66×10(-15) respectively) were significantly associated with persistent HBV infection. A novel SNP rs9366816 near HLA-DPA3 also showed significant association (P = 2.58×10(-10)). The ""T-T-G-G-T"" haplotype of the five SNPs further signified their association with the disease (P = 1.48×10(-12); OR = 1.49). The ""T-T"" haplotype composed of rs7756516 and rs9276370 was more prevalent in severe disease subgroups and associated with non-sustained therapeutic response (P = 0.0262). The ""G-C"" haplotype was associated with sustained therapeutic response (P = 0.0132; OR = 2.49). We confirmed that HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 loci were associated with persistent HBV infection in male Taiwan Han-Chinese. In addition, the HLA-DQA2 and -DQB2 complex was associated with clinical progression and therapeutic response."
Doc No.788,1107,negative/unlabeled,8.298662,HIV infection and hepatic enzyme abnormalities: intricacies of the pathogenic mechanisms.,"Liver enzyme elevations are common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, and their diagnosis or management may be difficult because of the intricacies of the pathogenic mechanisms involved. These include hepatotoxicity related to the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen, idiosyncratic or immunoallergic mechanisms, and direct cytotoxicity enhanced by an underlying liver disease. Liver enzyme abnormalities may also reflect hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) infection, which each have their own risks for chronic immune-mediated liver disease (including hepatitis flare after immune reconstitution) and of direct cytotoxicity. Finally, other factors may affect liver deterioration, including alcohol-related liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis associated with metabolic syndromes (e.g., hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or being overweight) that are potentially HAART related, and use of medication or illicit drugs (e.g., methamphetamine). A better understanding of these complex interactions, including adjustments of dosages of antiretroviral drugs, will probably help in the management of HIV-infected patients with liver enzyme abnormalities."
Doc No.789,240,positive/labeled,8.298223,LTR and tat variability of HIV-1 isolates from patients with divergent rates of disease progression.,"The genetic heterogeneity and transcription activity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) LTR region and tat gene have been examined. Comparison involved the relevant genomic regions of viruses isolated from twenty long-term survivors and from ten typical progressors. No significant differences were observed in mutation frequencies among the two groups, although there was a significant higher proportion of synonymous substitutions in the tat gene of viruses from typical progressors. Four LTR sequences showed an insertion of 20-31 residues at the junction between the LTR Nef-coding and the LTR noncoding region. Neither these insertions nor other genetic changes found in these sequences affected the LTR transcription function, as measured in transient expression assays using transfection of both established cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes with plasmid DNA. The results did not allow the association of structural or functional alterations in LTR or tat with a degree of disease progression. The results reinforce the concepts of complexity of HIV-1 evolution in infected individuals, and the multifactorial nature of progression to AIDS."
Doc No.790,7844,negative/unlabeled,8.297471,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection of neonatal severe combined immunodeficient mice xenografted with human cord blood cells.,"In these studies, neonatal C.B-17 severe combined immunodeficient (nSCID) mice were reconstituted with human cord blood leukocytes (hu-CBLs). The resulting hu-CBL-nSCID mice contained readily detectable human CD3+ T lymphocytes and CD20+ human B cells, and produced substantial levels of human IgM and IgG (including all subclasses). Human cells persisted in lymphoid organs and peripheral blood for at least 8 weeks, and CD4+ T cells outnumbered CD8+ T cells. Engraftment of human cells in peripheral lymphoid organs and blood was much greater than that seen in adult SCID mice grafted with adult peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). Hu-CBL-nSCID mice were susceptible to infection with laboratory-adapted and fresh clinical human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates. Following infection with HIV-1, virus could be recovered by the coculture of spleen, lymph node, peritoneal cavity, liver, and plasma samples from hu-CBL-nSCID mice with fresh human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and proviral copies were detectable following amplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HIV p24 core antigen levels in hu-CBL-nSCID mouse plasma were consistent with ongoing viral replication and high viral burdens. Rapid CD4+ T cell depletion occurred following infection with laboratory isolates of HIV-1 or a syncytium-inducing clinical isolate, but a non-syncytium-inducing clinical isolate caused expansion of CD8+ T cells, leading to an inversion of the CD4:CD8 ratio with only a transient decrease in CD4+ T cells. These results suggest that the hu-CBL-nSCID mouse system has unique features that mimic certain aspects of pediatric HIV infection, and distinguish it from other animal models of HIV infection, including the related hu-PBL-SCID model."

In this study, the genotype frequency of two IL28B SNPs (rs129679860 and rs8099917) in a cohort of chronic HCV-monoinfected patients in Brazil was evaluated and the SNP sufficient to predict the treatment response outcome was determined. A total of 66 naïve genotype-1 chronic HCV-infected patients were genotyped and the associated viral kinetics and SVR were assessed. The overall SVR was 38%. Both the viral kinetics and SVR were associated with rs129679860 genotypes (CC = 62% vs. CT = 33% vs. TT = 18%, p = 0.016). However, rs8099917 genotypes were only associated with SVR (TT = 53% vs. TG = 33% vs. GG = 18%; p = 0.032). In this population, the analysis of a single SNP, rs12979860, successfully predicts SVR in the IFN-RBV treatment of HCV."

Factors considered included duration of ZDV pretreatment, CD4+ cell counts, plasma HIV-1 RNA load, peripheral blood mononuclear cell HIV-1 DNA load, and HIV-1 DNA genotypic resistance to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. The three groups were well matched for baseline characteristics and did not differ significantly in virological and immunological response to the different combination treatments. Drug-specific resistance mutations were selected in more than half the cases by 3TC, but not by ddI and ddC. Low-level and substantial genotypic resistance to ZDV was detected 13 (33.3%) and in 19 (48.7%) patients at baseline, respectively, and evolved through week 24 in several patients. When subjects were divided into responders and nonresponders to the second nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor on the basis of a decrease of more than 0.5 log10 (n = 15) or less than 0.5 log10 (n = 21) in HIV-1 RNA, respectively, baseline genotypic ZDV resistance was the only independent predictor of failure in a logistic regression model (P = 0.003 or P = 0.024, depending on whether low-level resistance was considered or not, respectively). Thus, selection of ZDV resistance mutations may impair subsequent use of different nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor compounds."
Doc No.793,9056,negative/unlabeled,8.285144,Mannose binding lectin genotypes influence recovery from hepatitis B virus infection.,"Mannose binding lectin (MBL) is a central component of the innate immune response and thus may be important for determining hepatitis B virus (HBV) persistence. Since single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding MBL (mbl2) alter the level of functional MBL, we hypothesized that mbl2 genotypes are a determinant of HBV persistence or recovery from viral infection. We tested this hypothesis by using a nested case control design with 189 persons with HBV persistence matched to 338 individuals who had naturally recovered from HBV infection. We determined genotypes of two promoter and three exon 1 SNPs in mbl2 and grouped these genotypes according to the amount of functional MBL production. We found that the promoter SNP -221C, which leads to deficient MBL production, was more common in those subjects with viral persistence (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.89; P = 0.04). Those subjects homozygous for the combination of promoter and exon 1 genotypes associated with the highest amount of functional MBL had significantly increased odds of recovery from infection (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.84; P = 0.005). Conversely, those homozygous for the combination of promoter and exon 1 genotypes which produce the lowest amount of functional MBL were more likely to have viral persistence (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.02 to 3.01; P = 0.04). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that functional MBL plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute hepatitis B."

By using an in vitro experimental system, the mechanism of this suppression was investigated. Following in vitro infection of a laboratory HIV-1 strain, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of ACs transiently supported a low level of viral replication, then the virus production rapidly decreased. PCR analysis revealed that HIV-1 proviral DNA integrated in the PBMC of ACs following infection gradually decreased. Such tapering consequences of in vitro HIV-1 infection in the PBMC of ACs were abrogated by depletion of CD8+ T cells from the culture. Furthermore, the viruses subsequently produced by the PBMC of an AC were less able to replicate than the virus produced by CD8+ cell-depleted PBMC of the same donor. These observations suggested that the CD8+ T cell-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication in ACs may involve both cytocidal and cytostatic mechanisms: the former kills the cells producing viruses, and the latter inhibits viral spread by reducing viral infectivity."

The vaccines were tested in several hundred healthy or HIV-1-infected volunteers in Europe and Africa. Whilst larger trials of hundreds of volunteers suggested induction of HIV-1-specific T-cell responses in <15 % of healthy vaccinees, a series of small, rapid trials in 12-24 volunteers at a time with a more in-depth analysis of vaccine-elicited T-cell responses proved to be highly informative and provided more encouraging results. These trials demonstrated that the pTHr.HIVA vaccine alone primed consistently weak and mainly CD4(+), but also CD8(+) T-cell responses, and the MVA.HIVA vaccine delivered a consistent boost to both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, which was particularly strong in HIV-1-infected patients. Thus, whilst the search is on for ways to enhance T-cell priming, MVA is a useful boosting vector for human subunit genetic vaccines."

Genetic polymorphisms might influence gene transcription, leading to disturbance in cytokine production. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in TNF-α gene could affect the pathogenesis of HBV. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the role of TNF-α polymorphism [-863C/A (rs1800630), -308G/A (rs1800629), -376G/A (rs1800750), -857C/T (rs1799724) and +489G/A (rs1800610)] in the susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection. Polymorphisms of the TNF-α (-863C/A (rs1800630), -308G/A) were analyzed by Polymerase chain reaction sequence specific primer (PCR-SSP) while TNF-α (-376G/A, -857C/T and +489G/A) by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 104 patients with CHB and 104 healthy controls. The plasma level of TNF-α was measured using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The study showed a significant increase in the frequency of -863CC, -376GA, -857CC, -857TT and +489GA genotypes and -863C, -376A, -857C, and +489A alleles in CHB patients compared to controls. In addition, CAGCG haplotype had a highest frequency in CHB patients. A strong Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) between TNF-α -863C/A (rs1800630) and -376G/A (D' = 0.7888, r"

The prevalence of enteroparasitoses in patients with HIV/AIDS seen at two hospitals in Ceará , Brazil, was compared in the pre-HAART (Group 1; n = 482) and HAART (Group 2; n = 100) eras. Fecal parasitologic examinations (FPE) were performed using the direct, Lutz, Baermann-Moraes and modified Ziehl-Neelsen methods. The following parasites were detected in Groups 1 and 2, respectively: Strongyloides stercoralis--30.1% and 11% (p<0.0001), Ascaris lumbricoides--15.6% and 2% (p<0.0001), hookworms--3.7% and 2% (p<0.0001), Trichuris trichiura--13.1% and 1% (p<0.0001), Hymenolepis nana--0 and 1% (p = 0.1718), Giardia duodenalis--7.9% and 1% (p = 0.0076), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar--3.3% and 1% (p = 0.3301), Isospora belli--4.8% and 1% (p = 0.0993), Cryptosporidium sp.--8.1% and 0 (p = 0.0007), and non-pathogenic protozoans as well. There was a significant reduction in the prevalence of enteroparasites between the eras (63.9% to 24%; p<0.0001). In the HAART era, the following observations were made: greater frequency of enteroparasites in patients without antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.0575), as in those with AIDS (p = 0.08), and diarrhea (36% of the patients); lack of association with positive FPE (p = 0.626); and non-detection of Cryptosporidium sp. Strongyloides stercoralis showed an elevated prevalence in the two eras and was more frequent in men (32.41%) than women (19.04%) of Group 1 (p = 0.018), a finding suggesting the transmission of the helminth through sodomy. The advent of the HAART modified the profile of opportunistic infections, including parasites, probably due to the reconstitution of cellular immunity and the direct action of HAART on the parasites."

Various mechanisms are responsible for impaired anti-HIV-1-specific responses: programmed death (PD)-1 molecule and its ligand PD-L1 are negative regulators of T cell activity and their expression is increased during HIV-1 infection. This study examines correlations between T cell maturation, expression of PD-1 and PD-L1, and the effects of their blockade. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 24 HIV-1(+) and 17 uninfected individuals were phenotyped for PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subsets. The effect of PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade on proliferation and interferon (IFN)-gamma production was tested on eight HIV-1(+) patients. Naive (CCR7(+)CD45RA(+)) CD8(+) T cells were reduced in HIV-1 aviraemic (P = 0.0065) and viraemic patients (P = 0.0130); CD8 T effector memory subsets [CCR7(-)CD45RA(-)(T(EM))] were increased in HIV-1(+) aviraemic (P = 0.0122) and viraemic (P = 0.0023) individuals versus controls. PD-1 expression was increased in CD4 naive (P = 0.0496), central memory [CCR7(+)CD45RA(-) (T(CM)); P = 0.0116], T(EM) (P = 0.0037) and CD8 naive T cells (P = 0.0133) of aviraemic HIV-1(+) versus controls. PD-L1 was increased in CD4 T(EMRA) (CCR7(-)CD45RA(+), P = 0.0119), CD8 T(EM) (P = 0.0494) and CD8 T(EMRA) (P = 0.0282) of aviraemic HIV-1(+)versus controls. PD-1 blockade increased HIV-1-specific proliferative responses in one of eight patients, whereas PD-L1 blockade restored responses in four of eight patients, but did not increase IFN-gamma-production. Alteration of T cell subsets, accompanied by increased PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in HIV-1 infection contributes to anergy and impaired anti-HIV-1-specific responses which are not rescued when PD-1 is blocked, in contrast to when PD-L1 is blocked, due possibly to an ability to bind to receptors other than PD-1."

GM43 harbored HIV-1 circulating recombinant form 01_AE with gross deletions in the nef/long terminal repeat (LTR) region. The sizes of the deletions increased progressively from 84 to >400 bp during the 5-year period. GM43 appeared to have acquired defective variants from her husband. The genetic alterations in the nef/LTR region were remarkably similar to those that have been reported in slow progressors (such as the slow progressors in the Sydney Blood Bank Cohort). The present study is the first report of slow disease progression due to gross genetic alterations in the nef/LTR region in a person infected with an HIV-1 non-subtype B strain.
Doc No.800,677,negative/unlabeled,8.2724695,Dolutegravir and rilpivirine for the maintenance treatment of virologically suppressed HIV-1 infection.,"Triple combinations of antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs are the standard treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but the challenges include long-term side effects, high costs, and adherence. The recent advent of potent and well-tolerated ART has renewed the interest for newer ART strategies. A dual regimen with the combination of dolutegravir (DTG) and rilpivirine (RPV), two well-tolerated, metabolic-friendly, and potent drugs could offer additional benefits. Areas covered: A review of recent randomized trials and observational cohorts concerning the use of a dual therapy with DTG plus RPV as a switching strategy in patients with viral suppression. Expert commentary: Currently, data of more of 900 patients switched to this dual regimen are available. This combination shows a high rate of virological suppression, above 90% at 48 weeks, few discontinuations due to adverse events, improvement in bone and kidney parameters for patients discontinuing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lack of loss of the inflammatory control achieved with triple therapy, and a neutral effect on lipid parameters. Thus, for the first time, a dual regimen without protease inhibitors is effective, avoiding metabolic side effects and drug interactions. Longer follow-up is needed, but this dual regimen appears as a promising strategy for aging HIV-infected patients."
Doc No.801,3593,negative/unlabeled,8.268744,Role of PD-1 co-inhibitory pathway in HIV infection and potential therapeutic options.,"Virus-specific CD8+ T cells play an important role in controlling viral infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, during chronic HIV infection, virus-specific CD8+ T cells undergo functional exhaustion, lose effector functions and fail to control viral infection. HIV-specific CD8 T cells expressing high levels of co-inhibitory molecule programmed death-1 (PD-1) during the chronic infection and are characterized by lower proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic abilities. Although, antiretroviral therapy has resulted in dramatic decline in HIV replication, there is no effective treatment currently available to eradicate viral reservoirs or restore virus-specific T or B-cell functions that may complement ART in order to eliminate the virus. In recent years, studies in mice and non-human primate models of HIV infection demonstrated the functional exhaustion of virus-specific T and B cells could be reversed by blockade of interaction between PD-1 and its cognate ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2). In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of PD-1 pathway in HIV/SIV infection and discuss the beneficial effects of PD-1 blockade during chronic HIV/SIV infection and its potential role as immunotherapy for HIV/AIDS.

These two vectors, vCP205 encoding HIV-1 gp120 + TM (28 amino acid transmembrane anchor sequence) in addition to Gag/protease and vCP300 encoding gp120 + Gag/protease as well as Nef and Pol CTL determinants, are pancytotropic but replication incompetent in mammalian cells. Bulk peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or enriched CD8+ T cells were stimulated for 10 days with autologous ALVAC-infected PBMCs in the presence of different cytokine combinations (interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-4, IL-7, and IL-12). Activation by ALVAC constructs was highly antigen-specific, because vCP205 elicited only Env and Gag CTL, whereas vCP300 elicited broader reactivities against Env, Gag, Pol, and Nef determinants. The ALVAC activation of CTLp was IL-2 dependent and enhanced by the addition of IL-7, whereas IL-4 and IL-12 failed to augment cytotoxic reactivities elicited by these constructs. The expansion of enriched CD8+ T cells after activation with vCP300 was higher in patients with CD4 counts greater than 400 cells/microL. Two rounds of in vitro stimulation (IVS) with vCP300 resulted in nearly an eightfold expansion of CD8+ lymphocytes over a 25-day period. After the second IVS, an average 3.2-fold increase among the different antigen-specific CTL frequencies was achieved. These studies clearly show that HIV-recombinant ALVAC vectors represent powerful polyvalent antigenic stimuli for activation and expansion of the CD8 lymphocyte response that occurs as a result of HIV infection."
Doc No.803,4376,negative/unlabeled,8.266012,Blocking of monocyte-associated B7-H1 (CD274) enhances HCV-specific T cell immunity in chronic hepatitis C infection.,"The establishment of a chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection is associated with defective HCV-specific T cell responses. Recent studies suggest that negative T cell regulators such as programmed death 1 (PD-1) contribute to the impairment of virus-specific T cell functions in chronic viral infections. However, the implication of peripheral monocytes from CHC patients in the inhibition of HCV-specific T cell responses is only partially defined. In this study, we found that B7-H1, a ligand of PD-1, was significantly up-regulated on monocytes of CHC patients. Proliferation of T cells in response to anti-CD3 antibody was directly suppressed by B7-H1+CD14+ monocytes, and this suppression was reversed by addition of antagonistic B7-H1 mAb. Furthermore, blocking of monocyte-associated B7-H1 (moB7-H1) significantly enhanced the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing, HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells and the production of Th1 cytokines, such as IL-2 but not Th2 cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-10. Upon B7-H1 blockade, production of perforin was also increased in CD8+ T cells stimulated with HCV peptides. Our findings suggest that moB7-H1 inhibits HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte proliferation and suppresses Th1 cytokine production and perforin secretion. Blockade of the B7-H1 pathway thus represents an attractive approach in the treatment of chronic HCV infection."

All patients naïve to antiretrovirals who had > or =1 genotypic resistance testing at the Institute of Infectious Diseases (Brescia, Northern Italy) between 2001 and 2006 were analyzed. Primary resistance mutations were defined using epidemiological and clinical criteria. Mutations were interpreted using the Stanford University Algorithm. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess possible predictors of primary resistance mutations. Among 569 patients, 11% presented > or =1 mutation. Prevalence of primary resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), and protease inhibitors (PI) was 6.3%, 6%, and 1.6%, respectively. The most frequent mutations to NRTI were substitutions at position 215 (215Y in 3 patients, and 215 revertants in 16), 41L (13), 219Q (12), and 210W (10). Among mutations to NNRTI, 103N was found in 21 patients, while 181C, 188L, and 190A/S in 8, 3, and 4 patients, respectively. Fifty-one patients (9%) had high-to-intermediate resistance to > or =1 antiretroviral drug before starting the treatment. Regarding the new generation drugs, nine patients had intermediate resistance to etravirine, five patients had intermediate resistance to tipranavir, while five, one, and seven patients had low resistance to etravirine, tipranavir, and darunavir. Homosexuals were more likely to harbor a virus with primary resistance mutations (OR:2.68; 95% CI:1.44-5.00; P = 0.002) while non-Italian nationality was protective (OR:0.38; 95% CI:0.17-0.86; P = 0.020). Prevalence of primary resistance mutations suggests that genotypic resistance testing should be performed before starting treatment in naïve patients in Italy, particularly when NNRTI are prescribed."

Here, we identify an individual whose good initial control of viremia was lost in association with reduced containment of a superinfecting strain. Subject 2030 presented with acute symptoms of HIV-1 infection with high viremia and an incomplete seroconversion as shown by Western blotting. A low set point of viremia (approximately 1,000 HIV-1 copies/ml) was initially established without drug therapy, but a new higher set point (approximately 40,000 HIV-1 copies/ml) manifested about 5 months after infection. Drug susceptibility testing demonstrated a multidrug-resistant virus initially but a fully sensitive virus after 5 months, and an analysis of pol genotypes showed that these were two phylogenetically distinct strains of virus (strains A and B). Replication capacity assays suggested that the outgrowth of strain B was not due to higher fitness conferred by pol, and env sequences indicated that the two strains had the same R5 coreceptor phenotype. Delineation of CD8+-T-lymphocyte responses against HIV-1 showed a striking pattern of decay of the initial cellular immune responses after superinfection, followed by some adaptation of targeting to new epitopes. An examination of targeted sequences suggested that differences in the recognized epitopes contributed to the poor immune containment of strain B. In conclusion, the rapid overgrowth of a superinfecting strain of HIV-1 of the same subtype raises major concerns for effective vaccine development."

To induce CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) along with neutralizing antibody and CD4+ T cell help, a live canarypox virus construct expressing gp120, transmembrane gp41, the gag and protease genes, and sequences containing CTL epitopes in nef and pol was given simultaneously with, or followed by, rgp120 SF2. CD8+ CTLs were detected in 61% of volunteers at some time during the trial. Three to 6 months after the last immunization, the gene-specific responses were gag, 26/81; env, 17/77; nef, 12/77; and pol, 3/16. Simultaneous immunization with the canarypox vector and the subunit, beginning with the initial immunization, resulted in earlier antibody responses. In summary, a strategy of immunization with a canarypox vector expressing multiple genes of HIV-1 given with gp120 results in durable CD8+ CTL responses to a broad range of epitopes."
Doc No.808,9406,negative/unlabeled,8.245278,Biological testing versus sequence analysis for determination of drug resistance of human immunodeficiency virus.,"Resistance of HIV-1 to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) is associated with one or more of five mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) segment of the polymerase gene (""AZT-specific mutations""). Therefore, sequence analysis of the proviral DNA, derived directly from the blood, is considered to replace the biological test. Additional arguments are non-cultivatable viral strains, the universality of the sequence analysis in combination therapy, and the suspicion that the cultivated virus does not represent the predominant viral variant in the blood. In this investigation, 21 strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were comparatively analysed by molecular and biological testing. For 12 strains, the homology of the RT gene segment between the predominant provirus in the blood and the cultivated virus was ascertained (99.72% homology). 11 strains from untreated patients or patients treated no longer than 5 months were free from AZT-specific mutations and proved to be sensitive. 10 strains from patients treated for 17 to 57 months displayed 2-4 AZT-specific mutations. However, it was not possible to correlate the degree of sensitivity to the number or the pattern of the mutations. Suppression of AZT resistance by strain-specific sequences in other parts of the gene are discussed as the reason for that discrepancy. Remarkably, the productivity of resistant virus strains could be drastically enhanced by non-inhibiting concentrations of the drug."

Previous preclinical research with monkey models suggested that high concentrations and drug combinations are needed for high efficacy. We evaluated two long-acting reverse transcriptase inhibitors, tenofovir (TFV) and emtricitabine (FTC), by using a twice-weekly repeat challenge macaque model and showed that a preexposure vaginal application of gel with 1% TFV alone or in combination with 5% FTC fully protected macaques from a total of 20 exposures to simian-human immunodeficiency virus SF162p3. FTC and TFV were detected in plasma 30 min after vaginal application, suggesting rapid absorption. FTC was detected more frequently than TFV and showed higher levels, reflecting the fivefold-higher concentration of this drug than of TFV. Two of 12 repeatedly exposed but protected macaques showed limited T-cell priming, which did not induce resistance to infection when macaques were rechallenged. Thus, single drugs with durable antiviral activity can provide highly effective topical prophylaxis and overcome the need for noncoital use or for drug combinations which are more complex and costly to formulate and approve."

Infection with both viruses induces a remarkable enhancement in LTR-mediated gene expression that correlates with a change in the pattern of protein binding to the downstream kappa B site of the enhancer region. In HHV-6 infected cells, this change in the genomic footprinting pattern is concomitant with the induction of specific enhancer-binding proteins in the nucleus. The similarity of these events to those detected in other previously investigated experimental systems suggests that the LTR enhancer region is the ultimate target for the induction of the HIV-1 transcriptional response upon stimuli acting through different upstream pathways."

Here we report on our tests to check the hypothesis that defects in the IL-7 receptor system might be involved in this phenomenon. The cell surface expression of CD127 was measured ex vivo in CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes drawn from 3 groups of HIV patients. IL-7 function was also followed in vitro by measuring IL-7-driven T-cell proliferation, the induction of the CD25 activation marker, and overexpression of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2. Untreated viremic patients showed a slight but significant decrease in CD127 expression on the surface of their CD4 lymphocytes. By contrast, CD127 expression was substantially altered on the surface of CD8 T lymphocytes taken from untreated viremic patients. IL-7-induced overexpression of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 was dramatically altered in viremic patients, whereas IL-7-dependent CD25 induction and T-cell proliferation were reduced. Highly active antiretroviral therapy partially corrected these defects in patients with an undetectable viral load and CD4 counts of more than 400 cells/microL. The effects of HAART were less pronounced in patients with undetectable VL but low CD4 counts (<250 cells/microL). The IL-7 receptor is dysfunctional in the CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes of HIV-infected patients. This may be due to abnormal activation of the immune system in HIV-infected patients and may contribute to the reduced CD4 count and the altered function of the CD8 compartment."

Here we present a case report of an AIDS patient infected with a subtype F variant where extensive G-->A hypermutation (G-->A Hypm) sequences were found in the protease gene. This patient was failing HAART at the time the hypermutation was found. These sequences were basically encountered in the proviral compartment on two occasions and were persistently absent in the plasma viral population. The patient's viral genotype showed several mutations related to antiretroviral drug resistance in RT (T69N, M184V, T215F, K219Q) and protease (M36I, G48V, I54V, T63L, V82A) genes. The drug regimen was changed and the viral load dropped 0.9 Logs and CD4 count increased by 200 cells/ml. The hypermutation was not found any more in a 1-year follow up. The patient's wife was infected with a similar virus strain and G-->A Hypm sequences were also detected in the RT gene. This is the first report of sexual transmitted G-->A Hypermutation in HIV-1 and suggest that this phenomenon can be genetically coded by the viral RT molecule."
Doc No.813,8603,negative/unlabeled,8.241,Convergence and coevolution of hepatitis B virus drug resistance.,"Treatment with lamivudine of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) results in a high rate of drug resistance, which is primarily associated with the rtM204I/V substitution in the HBV reverse transcriptase domain. Here we show that the rtM204I/V substitution, although essential, is insufficient for establishing resistance against lamivudine. The analysis of 639 HBV whole-genome sequences obtained from 11 patients shows that rtM204I/V is independently acquired by more than one intra-host HBV variant, indicating the convergent nature of lamivudine resistance. The differential capacity of HBV variants to develop drug resistance suggests that fitness effects of drug-resistance mutations depend on the genetic structure of the HBV genome. An analysis of Bayesian networks that connect rtM204I/V to many sites of HBV proteins confirms that lamivudine resistance is a complex trait encoded by the entire HBV genome rather than by a single mutation. These findings have implications for public health and offer a more general framework for understanding drug resistance."

Reverse transcriptase (RT) is a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and thereby has been the prime drugs target for antiretroviral (ARV) therapy against AIDS. To date, two classes of RT inhibitors (RTIs), e.g., nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and a lot of compounds tested as RTIs have been described. To our knowledge, bis(heteroaryl)piperazines (BHAPs) have been considered as one class of promising NNRTIs, such as structurally and chemically related NNRTI delavirdine, which was approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in 1997. In this mini-review, we make attempts to report the progress of synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of BHAPs, in the meantime, the synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 replication by combining delavirdine with other HIV-1 inhibitors is also discussed. It will pave the way for the design and development of BHAPs as anti-HIV-1 agents in AIDS chemotherapy in the future."

The study investigated the difference between a group of Chinese HIV positive (N=36) and negative (N=131) opioid dependent adults maintained on methadone treatment. Comparisons were based on their quality of life (QOL), methadone treatment adherence, adverse symptom occurrence related to methadone treatment, and HIV-related behavior changes. No significant differences were found between the two groups in age, methadone maintenance dose, methadone adherence, sex desire, and drug craving level. Participants who were HIV positive reported significantly lower scores on physical health and total health-related qualify of life. They also reported greater engagement in injection related risk behavior before methadone treatment than those who tested HIV negative. For both groups, sexual and injection risk behavior significantly decreased following initiation of methadone treatment. A regression model revealed that those infected with HIV, associated significantly with higher likelihood of reporting constipation and lack of appetite, and higher frequency of reporting abdominal pain and nausea than HIV negative patients. The primary implication of these findings is that HIV positive persons in methadone treatment may require more focused services to meet their special HIV care and substance treatment needs."

Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are currently several US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for treating chronic hepatitis B, with Lamivudine (LAM) being the first oral agent made available. The major problem with LAM is significantly decreased effectiveness over time due to the development of anti-HBV resistance that can lead to virologic and biochemical breakthrough as well as hepatitis B flare, progression of liver disease, and decompensation of pre-existing cirrhosis. Despite its high anti-HBV resistant rate, LAM remains widely used in underdeveloped countries due to its wide availability and low cost compared to other antiviral medications, including those that are more effective. Therefore, it is still clinically important to learn how to prevent and treat LAM resistant strains of HBV. Several regimens with the other available antiviral agents have been studied, including switching to monotherapy with either Adefovir, Entecavir, or Tenofovir, adding Adefovir to LAM, and switching to a combination of Adefovir and Entecavir. This review article will examine molecular mechanisms and diagnosis of LAM anti-HBV resistance, risks for and approaches to reduce LAM anti-HBV resistance, and currently available rescue therapy regimens for LAM resistance.

Sexually active patients who were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) from five public hospitals in Trang province, Southern Thailand, were interviewed. Of 279 studied patients, 37.3% had unprotected sex in the prior 3 months and 27.2% did not disclose their serostatus to sexual partners. The median duration interquartile range (IQR) of using ART was 47 (27-60) months and 26.7% were non-adherent to ART (i.e., taking less than 95% of the prescribed doses). More than one-third had the perception that ART use would protect against HIV transmission even with unprotected sex. About 36.6% reported that they were unaware of their current CD4 counts and nearly one-third did not receive any safe sex counseling at each medical follow-up. After adjustment for potential confounders, non-adherence to ART and HIV-nondisclosure were strongly associated with an increase in the risk of unprotected sex with the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 5.03 (95% CI 2.68-9.44) and 3.89 (95% CI 1.57-9.61), respectively. In contrast, the risk for engaging in unprotected sex was less likely among patients having a negative-serostatus partner (aOR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.12-0.75), a longer duration of the use of ART (aOR = 0.98; 95%CI 0.97-0.99) and an unawareness of their current CD4 levels (aOR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.30-0.99). To maximize the benefits from ART, there should be a bigger emphasis on the ""positive prevention"" program and more efforts are needed to target the population at risk for unprotected sex. Strategies to encourage adherence to ART and for disclosure of serostatus are also required. "
Doc No.818,5936,negative/unlabeled,8.235885,Interleukin-21 responses in patients with chronic hepatitis B.,"Interleukin (IL)-21 has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in controlling chronic viral infections. However, little is known about the regulatory role of IL-21 in T cell immunity during the process of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). In the present study, the levels of serum IL-21 in 77 patients with various degrees of CHB in immune clearance phase (IC), 25 patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in immune tolerance phase (IT), and 25 healthy controls (HC) were measured and their potential association with major clinic indexes was examined. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CHB patients were stimulated with hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) in the presence or absence of anti-IL-21 antibody or recombinant IL-21, and the frequency of HBcAg-specific IL-21(+)CD4(+) and interferon (IFN)-γ(+)CD8(+) T cells was characterized by flow cytometry. Our data indicated that the levels of serum IL-21 were significantly higher in the IC CHB patients than that in the other groups and were positively correlated with the levels of serum HBV DNA and HBeAg in the IC patients. There was a low frequency of HBcAg-specific IL-21(+)CD4(+) T cells in IC CHB patients. Further, IL-21 enhanced HBcAg-specific IFN-γ(+)CD8(+) T cell proliferation, while treatment with anti-IL-21 inhibited antigen-specific IFN-γ(+)CD8(+) T cell expansion in vitro. Our findings imply that IL-21 positively regulates proinflammatory IFN-γ(+)CD8(+) T cell responses during the process of chronic HBV infection in humans. "
Doc No.819,7972,negative/unlabeled,8.234445,The Bel-1 protein of human foamy virus activates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gene expression via a novel DNA target site.,The Bel-1 protein of human foamy virus can activate transcription directed by the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The target sequence for Bel-1 is shown to lie within the HIV-1 LTR U3 region but does not coincide with any previously described factor-binding site. Gene expression directed by an HIV-1 LTR lacking functional sites for the inducible cellular transcription factor NF-kappa B was activated over 100-fold by coexpression of Bel-1. These observations suggest that Bel-1 has the potential to significantly enhance the level of HIV-1 gene expression in cells dually infected with HIV-1 and human foamy virus.
Doc No.820,6036,negative/unlabeled,8.234261,"Circulating CD8 T lymphocytes in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals have impaired function and downmodulate CD3 zeta, the signaling chain of the T-cell receptor complex.","Although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome have a high frequency of HIV-specific CD8 T lymphocytes, freshly isolated lymphocytes frequently lack detectable HIV-specific cytotoxicity. However, this effector function becomes readily apparent after overnight culture. To investigate reasons for T-cell dysfunction, we analyzed T-cell expression of the cytolytic protease granzyme A and CD3 zeta, the signaling component of the T-cell receptor complex. An increased proportion of CD4 and CD8 T cells from HIV-infected donors contain granzyme A, consistent with the known increased frequency of activated T cells. In 28 HIV-infected donors with mild to advanced immunodeficiency, a substantial fraction of circulating T cells downmodulated CD3 zeta (fraction of T cells expressing CD3 zeta, 0.74 +/- 0.16 v 1.01 +/- 0.07 in healthy donors; P < .0000005). CD3 zeta expression is downregulated more severely in CD8 than CD4 T cells, decreases early in infection, and correlates with declining CD4 counts and disease stage. CD3 zeta expression increases over 6 to 16 hours of culture in an interleukin-2-dependent manner, coincident with restoration of viral-specific cytotoxicity. Impaired T-cell receptor signaling may help explain why HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to control HIV replication."
Doc No.821,6137,negative/unlabeled,8.23405,Menstrual function in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.,"To assess whether HIV infection is associated with menstrual abnormalities in HIV-infected women without AIDS, we evaluated 248 premenopausal HIV-infected women without AIDS and 82 HIV-negative women. Detailed medical, drug use, and menstrual histories (using menstrual calendars) were obtained. Complete physical and pelvic examinations and CD4 counts were performed. HIV-infected women were more likely to experience intervals > 6 weeks without menstrual bleeding [8 vs. 0%, odds ratio (OR) = 10.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-1,000) and amenorrhea > 3 months (5 vs. 0%, OR = 7.1, 95% CI 1.1-1,000) (after adjustment for drug use, age, and race). Premenstrual breast swelling (p = 0.01), tenderness (p = 0.01), and dysmenorrhea (p = 0.04) were less common in HIV-infected women. There were no differences in intermenstrual bleeding or irregular menstrual cycles. Among HIV-infected women, only a past history of substance abuse was significantly associated with menstrual irregularities in a logistic regression model adjusting for age, current and past drug use, alcohol use, cigarette smoking, CD4 count, and category B conditions [1993 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) classification system]. The increase in amenorrhea (> 3 months) and in menstrual cycle intervals > 6 weeks and the lower rates of premenstrual breast symptoms in HIV-positive women suggest the possibility of disturbances in menstrual function that do not appear to be attributable to clinically apparent secondary complications of HIV. Changes in menstrual function were also significantly associated with a past history of, but not current, substance abuse, suggesting the possibility that socioeconomic factors rather than biologic effects of drugs may be responsible."
Doc No.822,9555,negative/unlabeled,8.231619,Serial CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocyte counts and associated mortality in an HIV-2-infected population in Guinea-Bissau.,"In an urban community in Guinea-Bissau, we followed a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) seropositive individuals (N = 47) and seronegative controls (N = 82). T-lymphocyte subset determinations were done in 1988, 1990, and 1992. Serial determinations of CD4 percentages, CD8 percentages, and CD4/CD8 ratios for the same individual were stable for 31 seropositive and 51 seronegative individuals with repeated measurements. We found no significant differences in the changes during a 2- or 4-year period in CD4 percentages, CD8 percentages, absolute CD8 T-lymphocyte counts, CD4/CD8 ratio, white blood cell counts, lymphocyte percentages, and absolute lymphocyte counts for HIV-2-seropositive compared with HIV-2-seronegative individuals. Only absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts changed more for the HIV-2-seropositive than for HIV-2-seronegative individuals (p = 0.037). HIV-2-infected individuals who lived with an HIV-2-infected spouse had a lower CD4/CD8 ratio and had higher mortality than HIV-2 infected individuals who lived with an uninfected spouse. However, there were no significant differences in immunological and hematological values for the 8 HIV-2 seropositive individuals who died and the 39 who survived in the 8-year follow-up period. In conclusion, progression of immunosuppression in HIV-2 infection seems to be slower than in HIV-1 infection and may not be inevitable in all individuals."

We aimed to assess resistance patterns and predict viral drug susceptibility among children with first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure in Uganda. A cross-sectional analysis of children switching ART regimens due to first-line failure was performed at three clinical sites in Uganda. HIV-RNA determination and genotypic resistance testing on all specimens with HIV-RNA >1,000 copies/ml were performed. Major drug resistance mutations were scored using the 2011 International Antiviral Society-USA list. The Stanford algorithm was used to predict drug susceptibility. At the time of switch, 44 genotypic resistance tests were available for 50 children. All children harbored virus with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance [95% confidence interval (CI) 92-100%] and NRTI resistance was present in 98% (95% CI 88-100%). Forty-six percent (95% CI 30-61%) of children harbored ≥2 thymidine analog mutations. M184V was identified as the only NRTI mutation in 27% (95% CI 15-43%). HIV susceptibility to NRTIs, with the exception of tenofovir, was reduced in ≥60% of children. Ugandan children experiencing first-line ART failure in our study harbored high rates of dual-class and accumulated HIV drug resistance. Methods to prevent treatment failure, including adequate pediatric formulations and alternative second-line treatment options, are urgently needed."
Doc No.824,4429,negative/unlabeled,8.2279415,An integrative bioinformatic approach for studying escape mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gag in the Pumwani Sex Worker Cohort.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is able to evade the host cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response through a variety of escape avenues. Epitopes that are presented to CTLs are first processed in the presenting cell in several steps, including proteasomal cleavage, transport to the endoplasmic reticulum, binding by the HLA molecule, and finally presentation to the T-cell receptor. An understanding of the potential of the virus to escape CTL responses can aid in designing an effective vaccine. To investigate such a potential, we analyzed HIV-1 gag from 468 HIV-1-positive Kenyan women by using several bioinformatic approaches that allowed the identification of positively selected amino acids in the HIV-1 gag region and study of the effects that these mutations could have on the various stages of antigen processing. Correlations between positively selected residues and mean CD4 counts also allowed study of the effect of mutation on HIV disease progression. A number of mutations that could create or destroy proteasomal cleavage sites or reduce binding affinity of the transport antigen processing protein, effectively hindering epitope presentation, were identified. Many mutations correlated with the presence of specific HLA alleles and with lower or higher CD4 counts. For instance, the mutation V190I in subtype A1-infected individuals is associated with HLA-B*5802 (P = 4.73 x 10(-4)), a rapid-progression allele according to other studies, and also to a decreased mean CD4 count (P = 0.019). Thus, V190I is a possible HLA escape mutant. This method classifies many positively selected mutations across the entire gag region according to their potential for immune escape and their effect on disease progression."
Doc No.825,6482,negative/unlabeled,8.226959,Activation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat by transforming mutants of human p53.,"We have studied the effects of human wild-type and mutant p53s on the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV). HeLa cells were cotransfected with a wild-type or mutant p53 expression plasmid and a plasmid containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene under HIV LTR promoter control. As expected, expression of wild-type p53 inhibited promoter function. Expression of a p53 mutated at any one of the four amino acid positions 175, 248, 273, and 281 correlated with a significant increase of the HIV promoter activity. The HIV LTR was also significantly activated in Saos-2 cells that do not express endogenous p53. This finding suggests a gain-of-transactivation function by mutation of the p53 gene. Cotransfection of wild-type and mutant p53-281G expression plasmids indicated that either the wild type or the mutant was dominant in inhibiting or enhancing promoter activity, respectively, when transfected in excess of the other. Transfection experiments showed transactivation even when the Sp1, NF-kappa B, and TATA sites in the LTR were individually mutated. Synthetic minimal promoter constructs containing two Sp1 sites or two NF-kappa B sites or an ATF site are also significantly activated by the mutant p53-281G. Thus, the mutant protein may activate transcription through interaction with either a general transcription factor or a common factor that bridges the basal transcription machinery and the transcription factors Sp1, NF-kappa B, and ATF."
Doc No.826,909,negative/unlabeled,8.223476,Cryptosporidial and microsporidial infections in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients in northeastern Brazil.,"To determine the frequency of the parasitic pathogens in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients in a developing world setting, 295 stool specimens were examined from 166 HIV-positive patients (49% with AIDS) at São José Hospital, Fortaleza, Brazil, from September 1990 to March 1992. Significantly more patients with diarrhea (85%) than without (66%) had AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) (P < .005). Of the potential parasitic causes of diarrhea, only Cryptosporidium parvum and microsporidia were significantly associated with diarrheal disease. Infections with C. parvum, but not microsporidia, were associated with the rainy season (P < .005). Thus, C. parvum and microsporidia are the most common intestinal parasites associated with diarrhea in an HIV-infected population in Brazil and are associated with advanced HIV disease. The association of C. parvum infections with the rainy season suggests that contaminated water may be important in its transmission; however, the source of human microsporidia requires further investigation."
Doc No.827,6726,negative/unlabeled,8.219664,Circulating immune complexes and cell-mediated immunity in patients with hepatitis B virus associated liver diseases.,"The prevalence of circulating immune complexes (CIC), their role and their relationship to cell-mediated immunity in patients with hepatitis B virus associated liver disease are still controversial. This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of CIC and their relationship to viral markers, to subsets of peripheral blood T lymphocytes and to suppressor cell activity in patients with hepatitis B virus associated liver diseases. CIC were positive in 29.3% of 41 healthy HBsAg carriers, 37.8% of 88 patients with hepatitis B virus associated liver diseases, and 15% of 41 healthy subjects by the platelet aggregation test (PAT). The prevalence of CIC in patients with acute hepatitis (40.0%) and in those with cirrhosis (61.5%) was significantly higher than in normal controls (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.005 respectively). There was no correlation between the titer of CIC and serum HBsAg titer or the status of HBeAg, and no significant decrease in the peripheral blood lymphocyte CD4/CD8 ratio in healthy HBsAg carriers (1.39 +/- 0.31) and in patients with liver diseases (1.40 +/- 0.54) compared to the normal controls (1.48 +/- 0.31). Concanavalin A induced suppressor cell activity on IgG producing cells was impaired in healthy HBsAg carriers (34.9%) (p less than 0.005) and in patients with liver diseases (25.3%) (p less than 0.0001), and this change was prominent in patients with chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis (p less than 0.0001). And there was a significant reverse correlation between concanavalin A induced suppressor cell activity on IgG-producing cells and the titer of CIC in PAT positive patients with hepatitis B virus associated liver diseases. In conclusion, it was suggested that defective suppressor cell function may lead to an increased B cell activation and such activity may account for the presence of CIC."
Doc No.828,8261,negative/unlabeled,8.21553,Different effects of Nef-mediated HLA class I down-regulation on human immunodeficiency virus type 1-specific CD8(+) T-cell cytolytic activity and cytokine production.,"A previous study using a Nef-defective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mutant suggested that Nef-mediated down-regulation of HLA class I on the infected cell surface affects the cytolytic activity of HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones for HIV-1-infected primary CD4(+) T cells. We confirmed this effect by using a nef-mutant HIV-1 strain (NL-M20A) that expresses a Nef protein which does not induce down-regulation of HLA class I molecules but is otherwise functional. HIV-1-specific CTL clones were not able to kill primary CD4(+) T cells infected with a Nef-positive HIV-1 strain (NL-432) but efficiently lysed CD4(+) T cells infected with NL-M20A. Interestingly, CTL clones stimulated with NL-432-infected CD4(+) T cells were able to produce cytokines, albeit at a lower level than when stimulated with NL-M20A-infected CD4(+) T cells. This indicates that Nef-mediated HLA class I down-regulation affects CTL cytokine production to a lesser extent than cytolytic activity. Replication of NL-432 was partially suppressed in a coculture of HIV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells and HIV-1-specific CTL clones, while replication of NL-M20A was completely suppressed. These results suggest that HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells are able to partially suppress the replication of HIV-1 through production of soluble HIV-1-suppressive factors such as chemokines and gamma interferon. These findings may account for the mechanism whereby HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells are able to partially but not completely control HIV-1 replication in vivo."
Doc No.829,9184,negative/unlabeled,8.212875,The importance of nef in the induction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication from primary quiescent CD4 lymphocytes.,"The viral regulatory gene, nef, is unique to the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and their related primate lentiviruses. Expression of the nef gene has been shown to be essential to the maintenance of high levels of virus replication and the development of pathogenesis in the animal model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. In contrast to this in vivo model, the use of standard T cell culture systems to study nef function in vitro has produced a spectrum of contradictory results, and has failed to demonstrate a significant positive influence of nef on viral life cycle. We have developed a cell model to study regulation of HIV-1 replication that we believe reflects more accurately virus-cell interactions as they occur in vivo. Our experimental system used acute virus infection of purified, quiescent CD4 lymphocytes and subsequent induction of viral replication through T cell activation. With this cell model, NL4-3 virus clones with open and mutated nef reading frames were compared for replication competence. The clones with nef mutations showed reproducible and significant reductions in both rates of growth and maximal titers achieved. The degree of reduced replication was dependent on initial virus inoculum and the timing of T cell activation. The influence of nef was highly significant for induction of virus replication from a latent state within resting CD4 cells. Its effect was less apparent for virus infection of fully proliferating CD4 cells. This study demonstrates that nef confers a positive growth advantage to HIV-1 that becomes readily discernable in the primary cell setting of virus induction through T cell activation. The experimental cell model, which we describe here, provides not only a means to study nef function in vitro, but also provides important clues to the function of nef in HIV infection in vivo."
Doc No.830,5127,positive/labeled,8.212401,Processing of blood samples influences PBMC viability and outcome of cell-mediated immune responses in antiretroviral therapy-naïve HIV-1-infected patients.,"Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay is increasingly used in vaccine clinical trials to measure antigen-specific T-cell mediated immune (CMI) responses in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and whole blood. However, recent observations indicate that several parameters involved in blood processing can impact PBMC viability and CMI responses, especially in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve HIV-1-infected individuals. In this phase I study (NCT01610427), we collected blood samples from 22 ART-naïve HIV-1-infected adults. PBMCs were isolated and processed for ICS assay. The individual and combined effects of the following parameters were investigated: time between blood collection and PBMC processing (time-to-process: 2, 7 or 24 h); time between PBMC thawing and initiation of in vitro stimulation with HIV-1 antigens (resting-time: 0, 2, 6 and 18 h); and duration of antigen-stimulation in PBMC cultures (stimulation-time: 6h or overnight). The cell recovery after thawing, cell viability after ICS and magnitude of HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses were considered to determine the optimal combination of process conditions. The impact of time-to-process (2 or 4 h) on HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses was also assessed in a whole blood ICS assay. A higher quality of cells in terms of recovery and viability (up to 81% and >80% respectively) was obtained with shorter time-to-process (less than 7 h) and resting-time (less than 2 h) intervals. Longer (overnight) rather than shorter (6 h) stimulation-time intervals increased the frequency of CD8(+)-specific T-cell responses using ICS in PBMCs without change of the functionality. The CD8(+) specific T-cell responses detected using fresh whole blood showed a good correlation with the responses detected using frozen PBMCs. Our results support the need of standardized procedures for the evaluation of CMI responses, especially in HIV-1-infected, ART-naïve patients."
Doc No.831,2899,negative/unlabeled,8.210992,Body composition changes in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"Malnutrition characterized by weight loss and often extreme wasting generally develops when patients progress from infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to AIDS. There is evidence that before the development of AIDS, HIV-infected patients without weight loss show early signs of malnutrition, defined as an increase in the ratio of extracellular mass (ECM) to body cell mass (BCM). As part of a dietary intervention study, body composition measurement were obtained at baseline and after 6 wk in 18 patients with HIV infection and CD4 counts between 140 and 740 cells/mm3. Only one patient had a prior weight loss (3.7 kg); patients gained 2 pounds after 3 wk of dietary supplementation of 500 kcal daily. Bioelectrical impedance was used to measured body compartments. The average ECM/BCM ratio (0.77 +/- 0.13) was within the normal range (0.83 +/- 0.16) indicating the absence of malnutrition by this criterion. Most measurements of BCM (kg) approximated normal values, while several for BCM (kg) exceeded normal. BCM (kg) correlated poorly with the ECM/BCM ratio (r2 = 0.08; P = 0.11) in contrast to ECM (kg), which was well correlated (r2 = 0.82; P = 0.00). In addition, there was a significant correlation of body mass index (BMI) with the ECM/BCM ratio (r2 = 0.38; P = 0.00) and with ECM (r2 = 0.244; P = 0.003) indicating that overweight patients may be more likely to be considered malnourished than normal weight patients using this ratio. Without use of bioelectrical impedance, these subtle changes might be missed. Once significant weight loss has occurred coupled with decreases in BCM (kg), the ECM/BCM ratio may be more reflective of malnutrition. These conjectures will require prospective evaluation, but for now it seems reasonable to include bioelectrical impedance as a potentially useful tool in the evaluation of malnutrition in this population."

After 24 hours of activation of mononuclear cells with plasmas it was demonstrated that as compared with control groups, in of plasmas of patients with highly active antiviral therapy increasing of number of CD4+ T-cells and decreasing of CD8+ T-cells is observed. The plasmas of patients with highly active antiviral therapy activate in most instances CD4+ T-cells whereas plasmas of patients without treatment--CD8+ T-cells. The results of detection of cytokines in blood indicate that in patients without treatment inflammatory potential is increased as compared with group of highly active antiviral therapy. The data concerning accumulation of interleukin-1β under cultivation of mononuclear cells with plasmas indicates at its role in preservation of vitality of natural killers. The analysis of immunomodulatory activity of plasma of patients infected with human HIV virus can be recommended as an additional technique of evaluation of functioning of immune system."

Content analysis was used to analyze the results of 21 face-to-face, semistructured interviews with women who had a personal history of injection drug use or who were the sexual partners of men who injected drugs. Contextual variables influencing women at risk for HIV infection that were identified included fear of HIV antibody testing, a belief that perinatal HIV transmission is inevitable, support for pregnancy termination in the event of HIV-associated pregnancy, a strong desire for children, pride in mothering behavior, and guilt about the possibility of transmitting HIV to unborn children. AIDS education and counseling for these women will be most effective if these variables are considered."

This compositional bias may be due to the guanine-to-adenine (G-->A) nucleotide hypermutation of the HIV genome, which has been explained by dCTP pool imbalances during reverse transcription. The adenine nucleotide bias together with the poor fidelity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase markedly enhances the genetic variation of HIV and may be responsible for the rapid emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. We have now attempted to counteract the normal mutational pattern of HIV-1 in response to anti-HIV-1 drugs by altering the endogenous deoxynucleoside triphosphate pool ratios with antimetabolites in virus-infected cell cultures. We showed that administration of these antimetabolic compounds resulted in an altered drug resistance pattern due to the reversal of the predominant mutational flow of HIV (G-->A) to an adenine-to-guanine (A-->G) nucleotide pattern in the intact HIV-1-infected lymphocyte cultures. Forcing the virus to change its inherent nucleotide bias may lead to better control of viral drug resistance development."

The HIV-1 Tat protein recruits the human positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb, consisting of cdk9 and cyclin T1, to the HIV-1 transactivation response (TAR) region. In the absence of TAR, Tat activates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) through its association with several cellular factors including C/EBPbeta. C/EBPbeta is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family of transcription factors and has been shown to be a critical transcriptional regulator of HIV-1 LTR. We examined whether Tat-C/EBPbeta association requires the presence of the P-TEFb complex. Using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot, we demonstrated that C/EBPbeta-cyclin T1 association requires the presence of cdk9. Further, due to its instability, cdk9 was unable to physically interact with C/EBPbeta in the absence of cyclin T1 or Tat. Using kinase assays, we demonstrated that cdk9, but not a cdk9 dominant-negative mutant (cdk9-dn), phosphorylates C/EBPbeta. Our functional data show that co-transfection of C/EBPbeta and cdk9 leads to an increase in HIV-1 gene expression when compared to C/EBPbeta alone. Addition of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) inhibits C/EBPbeta transcriptional activity in the presence and absence of cdk9 and causes a delay in HIV-1 replication in T-cells. Together, our data suggest that Tat-C/EBPbeta association is mediated through cdk9, and that phosphorylated C/EBPbeta may influence AIDS progression by increasing expression of HIV-1 genes."

The mechanisms leading to advanced liver disease progression in HCV/HIV coinfected subjects remain unclear.In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the association of HCV viremia, liver fibrosis, and immune response patterns in well-characterized HIV phenotypes: Elite controllers (Elites), HIV controlled (ARTc), and HIV uncontrolled (ARTuc) matched by age and race. Groups were stratified by HCV RNA status. Regulatory T-cell frequencies, T-cell activation (HLADR+CD38+), apoptosis (Caspase-3+), and intracellular cytokines (interferon-γ, IL-2, IL-17) were assessed using multiparametric flow-cytometry. Liver fibrosis was scored by AST to platelet ratio index (APRI).We found liver fibrosis (APRI) was 50% lower in Elites and ARTc compared to ARTuc. Higher liver fibrosis was associated with significantly low CD4+ T cell counts (P < 0.001, coefficient r = -0.463). Immune activation varied by HIV phenotype but was not modified by HCV viremia. HCV viremia was associated with elevated CD8 T-cell Caspase-3 in Elites, ARTuc, and HIV- except ARTc. CD8 T-cell Caspase-3 levels were significantly higher in HCV RNA+ Elites (P = 0.04) and ARTuc (P = 0.001) and HIV- groups (P = 0.02) than ARTc. Importantly, ARTuc HCV RNA+ had significantly higher CD4 T-cell interleukin-17 levels than ARTuc HCV RNA- (P = 0.005).HIV control was associated with lower liver fibrosis in HCV/HIV co-infected women. HCV viremia is associated with an inflammatory CD4 TH-17 phenotype in absence of HIV control and higher frequency of pro-apoptosis CD8 T-cells critical to avert progression of HIV and HCV disease that is attenuated in ART controllers. Elite controllers with HCV viremia are more prone to CD8 T-cell apoptosis than ART controllers, which could have negative consequences over time, highlighting the importance of ART control in HCV/HIV coinfected individuals.

Doc No.838,6915,negative/unlabeled,8.188729,Genetic diversity and drug resistance profiles in HIV type 1- and HIV type 2-infected patients from Cape Verde Islands.,"Our aim was to characterize for the first time the genetic diversity of HIV in Cape Verde Islands as well as the drug resistance profiles in treated and untreated patients. Blood specimens were collected from 41 HIV-1 and 14 HIV-2 patients living in Santiago Island. Half of the patients were on antiretroviral treatment (ART). Pol and env gene sequences were obtained using in-house methods. Phylogenetic analysis was used for viral subtyping and the Stanford Algorithm was used for resistance genotyping. For HIV-1, the amplification of pol and env was possible in 27 patients (66%). HIV-1 patients were infected with subtypes G (13, 48%), B (2, 7%), F1 (2, 7%), and CRF02_AG (2, 7%), and complex recombinant forms including a new C/G variant (n=8, 30%). Drug resistance mutations were detected in the PR and RT of three (10%) treated patients. M41L and K103N transmitted drug resistance mutations were found in 2 of 17 (12%) untreated patients. All 14 HIV-2 isolates belonged to group A. The origin of 12 strains was impossible to determine whereas two strains were closely related to the historic ROD strain. In conclusion, in Cape Verde there is a long-standing HIV-2 epidemic rooted in ROD-like strains and a more recent epidemic of unknown origin. The HIV-1 epidemic is caused by multiple subtypes and complex recombinant forms. Drug resistance HIV-1 strains are present at moderate levels in both treated and untreated patients. Close surveillance in these two populations is crucial to prevent further transmission of drug-resistant strains."

Detailed questionnaires, serologic screening, and polymerase chain reaction analysis (for a subset) were used. Evidence of HTLV infection was found in 16.5%, of which 89% were HTLV-II. HTLV infection was significantly associated with nonwhite race, older age, more years of intravenous drug use, prior use of heroin, history of gonorrhea, history of any sexually transmitted disease, hepatitis B virus infection, and antibody to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). By stepwise logistic regression analysis, associations persisted with race, age, hepatitis B markers, and HSV-2. Thus, the strong association of HTLV with hepatitis B, a marker for injection behavior, and the independent association with HSV-2 infection, a sexually transmitted pathogen, suggest similarities in the epidemiology of HTLV and human immunodeficiency virus infections in IVDUs."

The aetiology of the seizures includes opportunistic infections, neoplasia, HIV itself, metabolic derangements and drugs. Apart from treating the cause of the seizures, the challenge is to use the appropriate anticonvulsant drug (AED) to avoid potentially adverse drug-drug interactions in patients who are on concurrent highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Initial recommendations were that the newer AEDs should preferably be used because of their simpler pharmacokinetics. We report on our experience with the use sodium valproate (SV) in eight patients who were on concurrent HAART. There were two males and six females with a mean age of 34.1 years. The mean dose of SV was 1075 mg per day. Seizure control was excellent, the CD4 count improved and there was successful viral suppression in all patients. This small study showed that SV was safe and effective. It is also relatively inexpensive compared to the newer AEDs - an important consideration in resource poor settings."

J delta K cells exhibited very low levels of constitutive HIV production. HIV-1 expression was activated from J delta K cells by treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), sodium butyrate (NaB), or hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), but not tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), confirming the role of NF-kappa B in mediating TNF-alpha induction of HIV transcription. The strong induction of HIV expression by NaB or HMBA in J delta K cells clearly demonstrates the existence of NF-kappa B-independent mechanisms of HIV activation in chronically infected cells. J delta K cells may provide a useful model for characterizing NF-kappa B-independent transcriptional activation of the HIV LTR."
Doc No.842,4894,negative/unlabeled,8.176435,OTK18 levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid correlate with viral load and CD8 T-cells in normal and AIDS patients.,"OTK18 is a C2H2 type zinc finger protein expressed by human macrophages following HIV infection. OTK18 possesses antiretroviral activity, and its processing products accumulate in the cytoplasm of perivascular brain macrophages in advanced HIV encephalitis cases. Since the regulation of OTK18 expression in living patients following human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection is unknown, our objective is to investigate the first cohort study on OTK18 protein levels in living patients. We assessed OTK18 levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 44 living patients with or without HIV-1 infection, with diverse demographic and clinical background. A novel high-sensitivity OTK18 ELISA system was developed to measure OTK18 levels in CSF and plasma using custom made biotinylated monoclonal antibodies against OTK18. The correlation of OTK18 levels with epidemiological parameters was statistically analyzed. Multiple linear regression modeling suggested that plasma OTK18 levels for HIV-1-positive subjects were only about one sixth of that for HIV-1-negative subjects. Higher CD8 T-cell counts were associated with higher levels of OTK18. Using proportional odds logistic regression, we showed that HIV-1-positive patients have significantly lower OTK18 in CSF samples, but we did not observe significant correlation between CD8 T-cell counts and CSF OTK18 levels. OTK18 levels in both plasma and CSF are significantly lower in HIV-1-positive subjects as compared to HIV-1-negative subjects. Plasma OTK18 levels are positively correlated to CD8 T-cell counts, independent of HIV-1 status."

Prophylactic nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) are recommended for patients with breast cancer who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive before chemotherapy. We performed an up-to-date meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of prophylactic lamivudine use with nonprophylaxis in HBsAg-positive breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. PubMed, the Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were searched for relevant articles until June 2016. Eligible articles comparing the efficacy of prophylactic lamivudine use with nonprophylaxis in HBsAg-positive breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy were identified. Eight studies which had enrolled 709 HBsAg-positive breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy were analysed. Lamivudine prophylaxis significantly reduced the rates of chemotherapy-associated hepatitis B flares in chronic hepatitis B in breast cancer compared with patients with nonprophylaxis (odds ratio [OR]=0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07-0.35, P<.00001). Chemotherapy disruption rates attributed to HBV reactivation in the prophylaxis groups were significantly lower than the nonprophylaxis groups (OR=0.17, 95% CI: 0.07-0.43, P=.0002). Patients with lamivudine prophylaxis had a higher risk for tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif mutations than patients with nonprophylaxis (OR=6.33, 95% CI: 1.01-39.60, P=.05). Prophylactic antiviral therapy management is necessary for HBsAg-positive breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, in spite of high correlation with lamivudine-resistant HBV variants with YMDD motif mutations."
Doc No.844,7963,negative/unlabeled,8.173431,Causes of fever in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus who were admitted to Boston City Hospital.,"We prospectively studied causes of fever in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that required admission to a municipal hospital. A total of 168 HIV-infected persons were admitted for 220 episodes of fever: 72% were male, 80% were nonwhite, 65% reported prior injection drug use, and 74% had a baseline CD4 lymphocyte count of < 200/mm3. Bacterial infections, principally pneumonia, accounted for > 60% of the episodes; Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were most commonly isolated. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and disseminated infection with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) comprised 53% of the remaining sources of fever. In comparison with episodes of fever due to nonbacterial causes, those associated with common bacterial infections were significantly more likely to involve patients with a history of injection drug use (P = .02), higher admission leukocyte count (P < .004), shorter duration of fever (P = .003), shorter hospital stays (P = .0001), and a CD4 count of > 100/mm3 (P = .002). We conclude that bacterial infection, especially pneumonia, is a common cause of fever in HIV-infected patients admitted to our hospital. Patients with bacterial infections are more likely to report a history of injection drug use and have CD4 counts of > 100/mm3, shorter duration of fever, decreased length of hospitalization, and lower mortality than patients with fever due to PCP, disseminated MAC infection, or other causes."

Here, we examined a possible effector function of blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) to induce apoptosis in bystander CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The DCs were generated by culturing monocytes in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4. The DCs exposed to HIV-1 particles were co-cultured with healthy donor-derived blood T cells at a ratio of 1:20. Analyses by percent cell mortality, staining with propidium iodide and reactivity with Annexin V revealed the induction of apoptosis in both CD4+ and CD8+ target T cells. Further, this apoptosis occurred without stimulation with mitogens when the cell cycle of target T cells shifted from G0 to G1, probably due to the mitogenic effect of the DCs. Thus, induction of apoptosis in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells occurred via interaction with DCs adsorbed with HIV-1 particles."
Doc No.846,5828,positive/labeled,8.1729,"Baseline characteristics, response to and outcome of antiretroviral therapy among patients with HIV-1, HIV-2 and dual infection in Burkina Faso.","In an urban district hospital in Burkina Faso we investigated the relative proportions of HIV-1, HIV-2 and HIV-1/2 among those tested, the baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and the response to and outcome of antiretroviral therapy (ART). A total of 7368 individuals (male=32%; median age=34 years) were included in the analysis over a 6 year period (2002-2008). The proportions of HIV-1, HIV-2 and dual infection were 94%, 2.5% and 3.6%, respectively. HIV-1-infected individuals were younger, whereas HIV-2-infected individuals were more likely to be male, have higher CD4 counts and be asymptomatic on presentation. ART was started in 4255 adult patients who were followed up for a total of 8679 person-years, during which time 469 deaths occurred. Mortality differences by serotype were not statistically significant, but were generally worse for HIV-2 and HIV-1/2 after controlling for age, CD4 count and WHO stage. Among severely immune-deficient patients, mortality was higher for HIV-2 than HIV-1. CD4 count recovery was poorest for HIV-2. HIV-2 and dually infected patients appeared to do less well on ART than HIV-1 patients. Reasons may include differences in age at baseline, lower intrinsic immune recovery in HIV-2, use of ineffective ART regimens (inappropriate prescribing) by clinicians, and poor drug adherence."

These findings led health-care workers to use new disposable syringes and needles for administering injections. Bythe late 1990s, reports suggested that new disposable syringes and needles had become standard for all injections. However, surveillance data collected by the Romanian Ministry of Health (MoH) during 1997-1998 indicated that acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was associated with receiving injections among children aged <5 years. In Romania, injection frequently is used to administer medication, and nurses administer most injections. To identify the practices that might have resulted in injection-associated HBV transmission, selected clinic and hospital nurses were surveyed. This report summarizes the findings of the survey, which indicated that although nurses used new disposable syringes and needles, other inadequate infection-control practices might explain injection-associated HBV transmission. Results of the survey were used by the Romanian Coalition to Prevent Nosocomial Infections to prepare standards for injection safety to protect patients and health-care workers from HBV infection."
Doc No.848,4469,positive/labeled,8.166257,Detecting Mutations in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Pyrazinamidase Gene pncA to Improve Infection Control and Decrease Drug Resistance Rates in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Coinfection.,"Hospital infection control measures are crucial to tuberculosis (TB) control strategies within settings caring for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, as these patients are at heightened risk of developing TB. Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a potent drug that effectively sterilizes persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli. However, PZA resistance associated with mutations in the nicotinamidase/pyrazinamidase coding gene, pncA, is increasing. A total of 794 patient isolates obtained from four sites in Lima, Peru, underwent spoligotyping and drug resistance testing. In one of these sites, the HIV unit of Hospital Dos de Mayo (HDM), an isolation ward for HIV/TB coinfected patients opened during the study as an infection control intervention: circulating genotypes and drug resistance pre- and postintervention were compared. All other sites cared for HIV-negative outpatients: genotypes and drug resistance rates from these sites were compared with those from HDM. HDM patients showed high concordance between multidrug resistance, PZA resistance according to the Wayne method, the two most common genotypes (spoligotype international type [SIT] 42 of the Latino American-Mediterranean (LAM)-9 clade and SIT 53 of the T1 clade), and the two most common pncA mutations (G145A and A403C). These associations were absent among community isolates. The infection control intervention was associated with 58-92% reductions in TB caused by SIT 42 or SIT 53 genotypes (odds ratio [OR] = 0.420, P = 0.003); multidrug-resistant TB (OR = 0.349, P < 0.001); and PZA-resistant TB (OR = 0.076, P < 0.001). In conclusion, pncA mutation typing, with resistance testing and spoligotyping, was useful in identifying a nosocomial TB outbreak and demonstrating its resolution after implementation of infection control measures."
Doc No.849,2197,negative/unlabeled,8.164849,Viral long terminal repeat substrate binding characteristics of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase.,"A DNA binding assay was developed for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase. The assay was capable of defining discrete complexes between the enzyme and the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) substrate. DNA binding reflected the sequence requirements previously demonstrated for the enzyme's 3'-end processing activity. Binding exhibited a nonlinear dependence on integrase concentration, suggesting that the enzyme functions as a multimer. The oligomeric state was investigated by UV-photo-cross-linking of integrase-LTR oligonucleotide complexes using DNA substrates substituted with 5-bromo-2'-deoxycytidine within the integrase recognition sequence. In the absence of divalent cation, integrase cross-linked to the LTR oligonucleotide as a single species whose mobility by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was consistent with the formation of tetramers. Using these techniques, analysis of the binding properties of integrase mutants demonstrated that the catalytic and sequence-specific DNA binding activities of the enzyme are distinct, involving residues within the conserved ""DD(35)E"" and zinc finger motifs, respectively."
Doc No.850,9523,negative/unlabeled,8.163809,Protein kinase C and intracellular free Ca++: relationship to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced cellular hyporesponsiveness.,"Protein Kinase C (PKC) and Ca++ are both involved in the chain of events leading to T-cell activation. An impairment of the immune response is characteristic of T cells obtained from patients with HIV infection. In this report, the involvement of PKC and Ca++ in HIV-mediated cellular hyporesponsiveness was examined. Infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)s from HIV-seronegative normal donors with HIV strain HTLV IIIB, or two fresh patient isolates produced a 1.4-, 10.7-, and 11.4-fold enhancement in PKC activity at 1 hr postinfection (PI) and a 1.8-, 2.3-, and 3.8-fold enhancement at 12 hr PI, respectively. A marked decrease of PKC content, as determined by Western Blot analysis, was observed in HIV-infected cells by Day 4 and 7 PI compared with mock-infected control cells. Furthermore, PKC synthesis was also inhibited in cells from immunosuppressed AIDS patients. PKC activity of PBMCs from HIV-infected patients did not change in response to 1 microM of phorbal myristate acetate (PMA). In contrast, the same dose enhanced the activity by 50%-100% in PBMCs from normal HIV-seronegative donors. A 40%, 50%, and 125% increase in intracellular free Ca++ in response to HIV infection was observed 12 hr PI in MT4, JURKAT, and PBMCs, respectively. However, the increase in intracellular free Ca++ in HIV-infected PBMCs obtained from normal donors in response to PHA was 56% and 17% compared with an increase of 100% and 120% in mock infected cells at 12 hr and 1 week PI, respectively. Comparing the Ca++ response to PHA in PBMCs from HIV-infected patients showed that patients with < 250 absolute T4 cells/mm3 had an impaired Ca++ response. These data suggest that there is a relationship between intracellular free Ca++ and PKC and HIV-induced T-cell hyporesponsiveness."
Doc No.851,6029,negative/unlabeled,8.158558,Immune-based novel therapies for chronic hepatitis C virus infection.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a great public health problem, with an estimated 200 million chronically infected patients worldwide. No vaccines are currently available for HCV, and only a subset of HCV patients responds to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and Ribavirin treatment. Substantial evidence has emerged recently to support the role of the host immune response in the outcome and pathogenesis of HCV infection. Our aims of this article are to present the immune-based novel therapeutic options for HCV infection and the evidence supporting their use in patients with chronic hepatitis C. There is a growing consensus that acute control of HCV infection is associated with a vigorous intrahepatic antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response. IFN-gamma was detectable in the livers of the chimpanzees that cleared or controlled the virus, raising the possibility that IFN-gamma might perform antiviral effector functions during HCV infection. Based on these observations, therapeutic induction of intrahepatic IFN-gamma by adoptive immunotherapy might be able to control chronic HCV infection. Immune-based novel therapies appear to hold great promise in treating chronic HCV infection."
Doc No.852,8689,positive/labeled,8.143419,Association between HIV Type 1-specific T cell responses and CD4+ T cell counts or CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratios in HIV Type 1 subtype B infection in China.,"CD4+ T cell counts and CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratios represent key determinants of HIV disease progression and infectivity. However, the relationship between the HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response and these determinants has not been elucidated for all HIV-1B and HIV-1C proteins. In the present study, virusspecific T cell responses to HIV-1B and HIV-1C proteins were analyzed with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme- linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays using synthetic overlapping peptides corresponding to naturally occurring HIV-1B and HIV-1C consensus sequences. For Gag/Gag p24/Gag p17, a correlation between T cell responses and CD4+ T cell count in HIV-1 clade B and clade C was seen: elevated T cell response resulted in higher CD4+ T cell production. A statistically significant correlation between the Pol-specific T cell response and CD4+ T cell counts was also found in HIV-1 subtype C. For all HIV-1B and HIV-1C proteins, a correlation between the HIV-1-specific T cell response and CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratios was found for Tat and Pol proteins. CD4+ T cell counts in patients with Tat and/or Rev T cell response were higher than in patients without Tat and/or Rev T cell response. We suggest that this correlation within HIV-1B and HIV-1C Gag p24/Gag p17 responses makes the Gag p24/Gag p17 region a potential vaccine candidate and that HIV-1-specific CTL epitopes toward Pol are important in controlling HIV-1 infection; we emphasize that future vaccination strategies should include these early antigens, Tat and Rev."
Doc No.853,9382,negative/unlabeled,8.1423645,Novel patterns of nevirapine resistance-associated mutations of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in treatment-naïve patients.,"Several reports have recently shown that drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is often isolated from treatment-naïve patients. We phenotypically analyzed HIV-1 strains isolated from 44 treatment-naïve individuals and found two strains highly resistant (69- and >310-fold) against nevirapine (NVP). Direct sequencing showed these two isolates had a novel mutation, K238S, in reverse transcriptase (RT), but did not have any reported NVP resistance-associated mutation. A 48-h culture in the presence of NVP, however, selected HIV-1 carrying NVP resistance-associated mutations, V106A, V108I, or both, suggesting that minor viral populations of these two isolates had harbored these mutations. Replication kinetic studies of recombinant HIV-1 clones suggested that K238S conferred a significant resistance against NVP, especially when accompanied with V106A (530-fold) or V108I (56-fold). Our study identified a novel NVP resistance-associated mutation, K238S, which could be persistently detected by genotypic assay longer than V106A and V108I during off-treatment period."
Doc No.854,3885,negative/unlabeled,8.141229,Immune selection in vitro reveals human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef sequence motifs important for its immune evasion function in vivo.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef downregulates major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), impairing the clearance of infected cells by CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). While sequence motifs mediating this function have been determined by in vitro mutagenesis studies of laboratory-adapted HIV-1 molecular clones, it is unclear whether the highly variable Nef sequences of primary isolates in vivo rely on the same sequence motifs. To address this issue, nef quasispecies from nine chronically HIV-1-infected persons were examined for sequence evolution and altered MHC-I downregulatory function under Gag-specific CTL immune pressure in vitro. This selection resulted in decreased nef diversity and strong purifying selection. Site-by-site analysis identified 13 codons undergoing purifying selection and 1 undergoing positive selection. Of the former, only 6 have been reported to have roles in Nef function, including 4 associated with MHC-I downregulation. Functional testing of naturally occurring in vivo polymorphisms at the 7 sites with no previously known functional role revealed 3 mutations (A84D, Y135F, and G140R) that ablated MHC-I downregulation and 3 (N52A, S169I, and V180E) that partially impaired MHC-I downregulation. Globally, the CTL pressure in vitro selected functional Nef from the in vivo quasispecies mixtures that predominately lacked MHC-I downregulatory function at the baseline. Overall, these data demonstrate that CTL pressure exerts a strong purifying selective pressure for MHC-I downregulation and identifies novel functional motifs present in Nef sequences in vivo."
Doc No.855,2881,negative/unlabeled,8.132714,Decreased levels of recent thymic emigrants in peripheral blood of simian immunodeficiency virus-infected macaques correlate with alterations within the thymus.,"The thymus is responsible for de novo production of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and therefore is essential for T-cell renewal. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection on the production of T cells by the thymus. Levels of recent thymic emigrants within the peripheral blood were assessed through quantification of macaque T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC). Comparison of SIV-infected macaques (n = 15) to uninfected macaques (n = 23) revealed stable or increased TREC levels at 20 to 34 weeks postinfection. Further assessment of SIV-infected macaques (n = 4) determined that TREC levels decreased between 24 and 48 weeks postinfection. Through the assessment of longitudinal time points in three additional SIVmac239-infected macaques, the SIV infection was divided into two distinct phases. During phase 1 (16 to 30 weeks), TREC levels remained stable or increased within both the CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations. During phase 2 (after 16 to 30 weeks), TREC levels declined in both T-cell populations. As has been described for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, this decline in TREC levels did at times correlate with an increased level of T-cell proliferation (Ki67(+) cells). However, not all TREC decreases could be attributed to increased T-cell proliferation. Further evidence for thymic dysfunction was observed directly in a SIVmac239-infected macaque that succumbed to simian AIDS at 65 weeks postinfection. The thymus of this macaque contained an increased number of memory/effector CD8(+) T cells and an increased level of apoptotic cells. In summary, reduced levels of TREC can be observed beginning at 16 to 30 weeks post-SIV infection and correlate with changes indicative of dysfunction within the thymic tissue. SIV infection of macaques will be a useful model system to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the thymic dysfunction observed in HIV-infected patients."
Doc No.856,2229,negative/unlabeled,8.130466,Characterization of HIV-1 Gag-specific T cell responses in chronically infected Indian population.,"India is at the epicentre of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic in South-east Asia, predominated by subtype C infections. It is important to characterize HIV-1-specific T cell responses in this particular population with the aim of identifying protective correlates of immunity to control HIV-1 infection. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the breadth and magnitude of T cell responses directed at HIV-1 subtype C Gag, one of the most conserved HIV-1 proteins. The study population consisted of antiretroviral naive, chronic HIV-1 subtype C-infected individuals at various stages of infection. We used recent advanced techniques such as enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay and intracellular cytokine staining to quantify the total CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell response to HIV-1 gag at single peptide level, regardless of HLA haplotype of the infected individual. The p24-Gag was identified as the most frequently recognized subunit protein with the greatest magnitude of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses. Stronger and broader CD8 T cell responses were recognized, contrasting with the weaker and narrower CD4 T cell responses with regard to Gag protein subunits. The magnitude of the HIV-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma responses was observed to be higher than the corresponding interleukin (IL)-2 response, indicating the persistence of antigenic load in chronically infected Indian population due to the probable dysfunction of HIV-specific, IFN-gamma-secreting CD8 T cells in absence of IL-2 help."

Antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"Twenty six years have passed since the first cases of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were recognized in the U.S. Since that time, over 25 million people have died worldwide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1.1 million individuals in the U.S. are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with or without AIDS. With the advent of effective antiretroviral treatment strategies, HIV infection has now become a chronic disease requiring lifelong therapy. Despite the advances made in treatment, drug resistance, long-term adverse effects, and high adherence requirements continue to represent challenges to patients and clinicians. This overview will provide a summary of current antiretroviral drugs, treatment strategies, and novel therapeutic agents presently in development."

Ninety-nine patients received zidovudine, of whom 75% were males, 92% were minorities, and 59% had a history of intravenous drug use. Of the 99 patients, 72 had AIDS and 27 had ARC with T-helper (CD4) lymphocytes less than or equal to 500 mm3. Eighty-seven of the 99 patients (88%) were compliant with zidovudine therapy. Fifty-seven percent of these had at least one adverse drug reaction requiring dose reduction (44%) or cessation (13%). Adverse reactions were similar to those reported in other populations with HIV-related illness, although headache and nausea were less common. Twenty opportunistic infections (OIs) or HIV-related malignancies occurred in 15 of 82 (18%) patients who were on zidovudine for at least 4 weeks (7.6 OIs/1,000 patient weeks). Seven of the 82 died (9%), compared to 9 of the 17 patients (53%) who did not complete 4 weeks of zidovudine therapy (p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in any of these measures when intravenous drug users were compared with other risk groups. We conclude that zidovudine can be administered to intravenous drug users and others in an inner city clinic with acceptable compliance and tolerance."

To search for ongoing viral replication in 10 patients on combination antiretroviral therapy for up to 1 year, the emergence of genotypic drug resistance across different compartments was studied and correlated with plasma viral RNA levels. In addition, lymph node (LN) mononuclear cells were assayed for the presence of multiply spliced RNA. Population sequencing of HIV-1 pol was done on plasma RNA, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) RNA, PBMC DNA, LN RNA, LN DNA, and RNA from virus isolated from PBMCs or LNs. A special effort was made to obtain sequences from patients with undetectable plasma RNA, emphasizing the rapidly emerging lamivudine-associated M184V mutation. Furthermore, concordance of drug resistance mutations across compartments was investigated. No evidence for viral replication was found in patients with plasma HIV RNA levels of <20 copies/ml. In contrast, evolving genotypic drug resistance or the presence of multiply spliced RNA provided evidence for low-level replication in subjects with plasma HIV RNA levels between 20 and 400 copies/ml. All patients failing therapy showed multiple drug resistance mutations in different compartments, and multiply spliced RNA was present upon examination. Concordance of nucleotide sequences from different tissue compartments obtained concurrently from individual patients was high: 98% in the protease and 94% in the reverse transcriptase regions. These findings argue that HIV replication differs significantly between patients on potent antiretroviral therapy with low but detectable viral loads and those with undetectable viral loads."

Previously, we and others have found diminished IL-7R levels in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) - infected non-human primates and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - infected patients. To date, it remains unknown whether changes in IL-7R expression could also be linked to non-infectious inflammatory diseases such as asthma or anti-inflammatory drug use. Here, we investigated through flow cytometry the levels of IL-7R expression on CD4+ and CD4- T-cells in asthmatic patients in relation to disease severity, immune status and glucocorticoid (GC) use. In addition, we sought to evaluate the effects of in vivo and in vitro GC treatment on IL-7R expression in both asthmatic patients and SIV-infected non-human primates. We demonstrated that expression of IL-7R on peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells was significantly decreased in clinically stable GC-naive mild and moderate asthmatic patients. Accordingly, the development of asthmatic reaction following bronchial allergen challenge performed in sensitized subjects was associated with a significant drop in levels of IL-7R on circulating CD4+ T-cells. In contrast, CD4+ T-cells from both, mild and moderate, but not severe asthmatics, treated with inhaled GC displayed levels of IL-7R similar to that seen in healthy controls. We did not find significant differences with serum or sputum interleukin-7 levels among healthy controls and GC-naïve and GC-treated asthmatic patients. Furthermore, both in vitro GC treatment and short-term oral GC administration to asthmatic patients resulted in a significant enhancement of IL-7R. Similarly, we demonstrated that GC-stimulated T-cells from SIV-infected non-human primates up-regulated IL-7R expression. Accordingly, experimental short-term systemic in vivo administration of GC to SIV-infected macaques led to enhancement of IL-7R expression on circulating T-cells. Our data indicate that GC bear potential to recover diminished IL-7R expression, as well in asthma as in lentiviral infection. "
Doc No.861,8310,negative/unlabeled,8.118109,Multilayered defense in HLA-B51-associated HIV viral control.,"Polymorphism in the HLA region of a chromosome is the major source of host genetic variability in HIV-1 outcome, but there is limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of protective class I alleles such as HLA-B57, -B27, and -B51. Taking advantage of a unique cohort infected with clade B' HIV-1 through contaminated blood, in which many variables such as the length of infection, the infecting viral strain, and host genetic background are controlled, we performed a comprehensive study to understand HLA-B51-associated HIV-1 control. We focused on the T cell responses against three dominant HLA-B51-restricted epitopes: Gag327-345(NI9) NANPDCKTI, Pol743-751(LI9) LPPVVAKEI, and Pol283-289(TI8) TAFTIPSI. Mutations in all three dominant epitopes were significantly associated with HLA-B51 in the cohort. A clear hierarchy in selection of epitope mutations was observed through epitope sequencing. L743I in position 1 of epitope LI9 was seen in most B51(+) individuals, followed by V289X in position 8 of the TI8, and then, A328S, in position 2 of the NI9 epitope, was also seen in some B51(+) individuals. Good control of viral load and higher CD4(+) counts were significantly associated with at least one detectable T cell response to unmutated epitopes, whereas lower CD4(+) counts and higher viral loads were observed in patients who had developed escape mutations in all three epitopes or who lacked T cell responses specific to these epitope(s). We propose that patients with HLA-B51 benefit from having multiple layers of effective defense against the development of immune escape mutations."
Doc No.862,8890,positive/labeled,8.116528,Peptide insertions in reverse transcriptase pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 as a rare cause of persistent antiretroviral therapeutic failure.,"Peptide insertions in codons 67-71 of the reverse transcriptase (RT) pol gene were detected in 11 (2.7%) of 414 genotypic analyses performed in a hospital cohort of 2900 outpatients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. The duration of antiretroviral treatment (bi- or tri-therapy) before the detection of insertions ranged from 12 to 60 months. Dipeptide insertions were detected in ten patients, of which the most frequent was serine-serine. A monopeptide insertion was diagnosed once. The amino-acid composition patterns of insertions varied with time in five of the 11 patients. Peptide insertions were always associated with various patterns of pre-existing or appearing resistance mutations in the RT pol gene to different antiretroviral drugs. Genotypic-guided treatment resulted in virological and immunological improvement in two patients. In contrast, the remaining patients did not respond to any of the various antiretroviral regimens prescribed. Furthermore, various patterns of resistance mutations developed to the prescribed antiretroviral drugs, with AIDS-related conditions leading to death in two patients. It was concluded that peptide insertion in this region of the HIV-1 RT pol gene constitutes a rare cause of persistent therapeutic failure, and that management of such patients remains challenging despite successive genotypic analyses aimed at detecting mutations conferring antiretroviral drug resistance."
Doc No.863,4542,negative/unlabeled,8.113907,Sequence variability of the HIV type 1 protease gene in thai patients experienced with antiretroviral therapy.,"One hundred sequences of HIV-1 protease with the two flanking cleavage sites from 10 antiretroviral drug-treated Thai patients were examined for residue variability and for mutations at positions associated with the resistance to protease inhibitors. Seven patients were infected with CRF01_AE, two with subtype B, and one with a strain that did not belong to any of the currently identified subtypes or recombinant forms. A total of 46 out of the 99 positions (46%) in HIV-1 protease showed at least one amino acid change as compared with the HXB2 subtype B protease. Interestingly, 35% of these mutations were at positions associated with resistance to the PIs. The observation indicated that the viral protease is flexible in tolerating some degree of amino acid substitutions even in the critical regions under the selective pressure driven by antiretroviral drugs. The PR/RT cleavage site revealed conservation of the HXB2 sequence. Nevertheless, the p6*/PR cleavage site displayed variability, notably in the p6* region."
Doc No.864,5536,negative/unlabeled,8.11315,Cross-clade CD8 T-cell responses to HIV(IIIB) and Chinese B' and C/B' viruses in North American and Chinese HIV-seropositive donors.,"HIV variation presents an obstacle to a global AIDS vaccine. Viral diversity and host variations in MHC expression both affect vaccine responses. Whether CD8 T cells from HIV-infected donors in 1 part of the world cross-recognize isolates from other regions will provide guidance about whether country-specific vaccines are needed. We compared recognition of HIV(IIIB) and representative B' (Thai B) and recombinant C/B' virus strains endemic in China by CD8 T cells from 7 HIV-infected North American donors and 4 Chinese donors. IFN-gamma production in response to HIV(IIIB) or the Chinese viruses was comparable. Although 1.6 +/- 0.8% of American donor CD8 T cells produced IFN-gamma above the background level in response to IIIB virus, 1.5 +/- 0.8% responded to B' virus, and 1.4 +/- 0.7% responded to C/B' virus. Responses to adherent cells infected with vaccinia viruses expressing B' and C/B' virus gag and env were also comparable in magnitude with responses to IIIB virus. Cytolysis of CD4 T cells infected with B' virus was comparable with lysis of cells infected with IIIB virus, but lysis of the more divergent C/B' virus was somewhat reduced. T cells, selected for IFN-gamma production to IIIB virus, also efficiently lysed cells infected with Chinese viruses. Therefore, cross-clade CD8 T-cell responses to IIIB virus and prevalent Chinese viral strains are common."
Doc No.865,6037,negative/unlabeled,8.108472,Stimulation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) gene expression by the cytomegalovirus and HIV-2 transactivator gene.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often causes latent infection. Transactivation by some DNA viruses has been implicated in inducing HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis. The transactivator (IE-2) gene of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) can enhance HIV-2 as well as HIV-1 gene expression in vitro. This inducer can act in concert with the HIV-2 tat gene and T-cell activation in enhancing gene expression in human CD4+ lymphocytes. While the HIV-2 and HIV-1 tat genes and T-cell activators apparently employ independent modes of action, the CMV transactivator in combination with the HIV-2 tat or T-cell activators may employ a gene activation pathway with some common and some distinct components. Both HIV-2 and CMV transactivators enhance HIV-2 gene expression by transcriptional activation involving transcript initiation as well as elongation, with CMV transactivator affecting elongation more than the initiation. A significant proportion of transcripts appear to terminate prematurely in the absence of transactivators. Deletion mutation analysis of the HIV-2 long terminal repeat (LTR) suggests that the element that responds to CMV transactivation in human CD4+ lymphocytes is either a diffuse one or located downstream of the HIV-2 enhancer element."
Doc No.866,5554,negative/unlabeled,8.107991,Hepatitis B virus variants in an HIV-HBV co-infected patient at different periods of antiretroviral treatment with and without lamivudine.,"Lamivudine inhibits replication of both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is commonly used as part of antiretroviral therapy. The main limitation in the use of lamivudine is resistant mutation selection. Most of these mutations affect the YMDD motif of the HBV DNA polymerase. The resistance occurs through M550V or M550I aminoacid replacements. The M550V variation may be accompanied by L526M mutation, notably in HIV-HBV co-infected patients. The aim of this study was to investigate mutations associated with lamivudine resistance in a hemodialysis patient chronically co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, who was submitted to several antiretroviral treatments."
Doc No.867,8157,negative/unlabeled,8.107071,Phenotypical and functional evaluation of CD8+/S6F1+ T lymphocytes in haemophiliac individuals with HIV-1 infection.,"In this study we investigated the distribution of the S6F1 antigen, an epitope of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen, on CD8+ T lymphocytes in a series of 15 HIV-1+ and 20 HIV-1- haemophiliac patients. MoAbs recognizing the S6F1 antigen have been claimed to distinguish between killer effectors (brightly S6F1+ stained) and suppressor cells (dimly S6F1+ stained) within the CD8+ lymphoid population. In addition, we tried to find a correlation between the spontaneous in vitro immunoglobulin synthesis from patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes and the pattern of S6F1 expression. Although the total number of double-positive CD8+/S6F1+ cells was similar in both HIV-1+ and HIV-1- haemophiliac patients, a significant increase in the CD8+/S6F1+ population bright versus dim was documented in HIV-1-infected with respect to HIV-1- haemophiliacs (bright/dim ratio 3.97 +/- 0.61 versus 0.75 +/- 0.1, respectively, P < 0.005). This finding was correlated to a significant increase in spontaneous in vitro immunoglobulin production in HIV-1+ subjects compared with control haemophiliacs (P < 0.005). Purified CD8+ lymphocytes from HIV-1+ subjects showed a reduced suppressor activity on mitogen-induced immunoglobulin production. Taken together, these data suggest that HIV-1 infection favours the generation of CD8+/S6F1+ bright cells with putative cytotoxic-associated function, leading to a progressive reduction in the number of CD8+/S6F1+ dim suppressor lymphocytes. This phenomenon may contribute to the polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia present in HIV-1+ haemophiliac patients."
Doc No.868,1269,negative/unlabeled,8.106068,A novel action of minocycline: inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in microglia.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the brain produces a characteristic disease called acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia in which productive infection and inflammatory activation of microglia and macrophages play a central role. In this report, the authors demonstrate that minocycline (MC), a second-generation tetracycline with proven safety and penetration to the central nervous system, potently inhibited viral production from microglia. Inhibition of viral release was sustained through the entire course of infection and even when the drug exposure was limited to the first day of infection. Minocycline was effective even at low viral doses, and against R5- and X4R5-HIV, as well as in single-cycle reporter virus assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis showed that minocycline inhibited nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation in microglia. HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-promoter activity in U38 cells was also inhibited. These results, combined with recently demonstrated in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of MC on microglia, suggest a potential utility for MC as an effective adjunct therapy for AIDS dementia."
Doc No.869,6490,negative/unlabeled,8.1024,T-cell--mediated autologous hepatocytotoxicity in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.,"Virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have been suggested to be responsible for the liver injuries in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, there has been no report of direct evidence to substantiate this hypothesis. In this study, we performed in vitro autologous hepatocytotoxicity assay in 45 patients to examine a possible role of CTLs to HCV-infected live cells. The data were correlated with histology activity index of liver biopsy specimens. Lymphocyte subsets and hepatocyte expression of human major histocompatibility complex antigens class I and class II (HLA-I and HLA-II) were also evaluated. The immunohistochemical study showed more prominent HLA-I expression than HLA-II on hepatocytes (mean score +/- SEM:2.34 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.42 +/- 0.08; P < .01). The lymphocyte subset analysis showed that CD8+ T cells were dominant in the lobular areas showing spotty necrosis, whereas CD4+ T cells were prominent in the portal and periportal areas (P < .01). Most patients had a significant T cell-mediated cytotoxicity to hepatocytes as compared with non-T cells (percentage cytotoxicity +/- SEM:46.4 +/- 2.3 vs. 13.8 +/- 2.7; P < .001). T cell-mediated hepatocytotoxicity had a linear correlation with HAI (P < .05). The T cell-mediated cytotoxicity could be blocked by anti-CD8 (43.7% vs. 18.5%, P < .05) but not by anti-CD4 or anti-HLA-II monoclonal antibodies. These findings strongly suggest that HLA-I-restricted, CD8+ T cell-mediated hepatocytotoxicity is an important pathogenetic mechanism in patients with chronic HCV infection."
Doc No.870,4661,positive/labeled,8.099272,Long-Term Spontaneous Control of HIV-1 Is Related to Low Frequency of Infected Cells and Inefficient Viral Reactivation.,"HIV establishes reservoirs of infected cells that persist despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). In most patients, the virus begins to replicate soon after treatment interruption. However, a low frequency of infected cells at the time of treatment interruption has been associated with delayed viral rebound. Likewise, individuals who control the infection spontaneously, so-called HIV-1 controllers (HICs), carry particularly low levels of infected cells. It is unclear, however, whether and how this small number of infected cells contributes to durable viral control. Here we compared 38 HICs with 12 patients on effective combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) and found that the low frequency of infected cells in the former subjects was associated both with less efficient viral reactivation in resting CD4(+) T cells and with less efficient virion production ex vivo We also found that a potent HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell response was present only in those HICs whose CD4(+) T cells produced virus ex vivo Long-term spontaneous control of HIV infection in HICs thus appears to be sustained on the basis of the inefficient reactivation of viruses from a limited number of infected cells and the capacity of HICs to activate a potent HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell response to counteract efficient viral reactivation events."

The spectrum of renal impairment is very wide from clinically insignificant to end stage renal disease and often requires nephrologist's consultation. Therefore, we established combined renal and HIV care in the HIV Out-Patient Clinic in Warsaw. Medical records of patients consulted by nephrologist from March 2014 to March 2015 were included in analyses. Patients changing medication without consulting the physician or persistently not coming for follow-up visits were defined as non-compliant. In statistical analyses, non-parametric tests and logistic regression models were used as appropriate. In total, 100 patients were consulted by a nephrologist during the study period. All patients were white Europeans, 88 (88%) male, 42 (42%) infected through men having sex with men and 16 (16%) through intravenous drug users. Fifteen (15%) patients had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and 11 (11%) confirmed with positive HCV RNA. The most common reasons for referral were proteinuria and increased serum creatinine. In 6 out of 31 patients (19.3% of those referred for increased creatinine level) elevated serum creatinine was due to illegal substances or diet supplements use. Fifty-seven (57%) of patients were non-compliant. In univariate logistic regression models, all tested factors were non-significant. In most cases, patients were referred to nephrologist due to possible link between laboratory abnormalities and antiretroviral treatment. In one out of five cases, elevated creatinine level was linked with substance/dietary abuse. Poor compliance is an important problem in integrated nephrological care, however we were not able to identify any factors associated with non-compliance."
Doc No.872,4646,negative/unlabeled,8.096049,Residual viral replication during antiretroviral therapy boosts human immunodeficiency virus type 1-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in subjects treated early after infection.,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected subjects treated early after infection have preserved HIV-1-specific CD4+ T-cell function. We studied the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the frequency of HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in patients treated during early (n = 31) or chronic (n = 23) infection. The degree of viral suppression and time of initiation of treatment influenced the magnitude of the CD8+ T-cell response. HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells can increase in number after HAART in subjects treated early after infection who have episodes of transient viremia.
Doc No.873,1033,negative/unlabeled,8.094509,Lentiviral vector-based prime/boost vaccination against AIDS: pilot study shows protection against Simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac251 challenge in macaques.,"AIDS vaccination has a pressing need for more potent vaccination vectors capable of eliciting strong, diversified, and long-lasting cellular immune responses against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Lentiviral vectors have demonstrated efficiency not only as gene delivery vehicles for gene therapy applications but also as vaccination tools. This is likely due to their ability to transduce nondividing cells, including dendritic cells, enabling sustained endogenous antigen presentation and thus the induction of high proportions of specific cytotoxic T cells and long-lasting memory T cells. We show in a first proof-of-concept pilot study that a prime/boost vaccination strategy using lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with a glycoprotein G from two non-cross-reactive vesicular stomatitis virus serotypes elicited robust and broad cellular immune responses against the vector-encoded antigen, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) GAG, in cynomolgus macaques. Vaccination conferred strong protection against a massive intrarectal challenge with SIVmac251, as evidenced both by the reduction of viremia at the peak of acute infection (a mean of over 2 log(10) fold reduction) and by the full preservation of the CD28(+) CD95(+) memory CD4(+) T cells during the acute phase, a strong correlate of protection against pathogenesis. Although vaccinees continued to display lower viremia than control macaques during the early chronic phase, these differences were not statistically significant by day 50 postchallenge. A not-optimized SIV GAG antigen was chosen to show the strong potential of the lentiviral vector system for vaccination. Given that a stronger protection can be anticipated from a modern HIV-1 antigen design, gene transfer vectors derived from HIV-1 appear as promising candidates for vaccination against HIV-1 infection."
Doc No.874,4335,positive/labeled,8.084825,"CD127 expression, exhaustion status and antigen specific proliferation predict sustained virologic response to IFN in HCV/HIV co-infected individuals.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the HIV co-infected population. Interferon-alpha (IFN-α) remains a major component of anti-HCV therapy despite its deleterious effects on the immune system. Furthermore, IFN-α was recently shown to diminish the size of the latent HIV reservoir. The objectives of this study were to monitor the impact of IFN-α on T cell phenotype and proliferation of HIV and HCV-specific T cells during IFN therapy, and to identify immune markers that can predict the response to IFN in HICV/HIV co-infected patients. We performed longitudinal analyses of T cell numbers, phenotype and function in co-infected patients undergoing IFN-α therapy with different outcomes including IFN-α non-responders (NR) (n = 9) and patients who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) (n = 19). We examined the expression of activation (CD38, HLA-DR), functional (CD127) and exhaustion markers (PD1, Tim-3, CD160 and CD244) on total CD4 and CD8 T cells before, during and after therapy. In addition, we examined the HIV- and HCV-specific proliferative responses against HIV-p24 and HCV-NS3 proteins. Frequencies of CD127+ CD4 T cells were higher in SVR than in NR patients at baseline. An increase in CD127 expression on CD8 T cells was observed after IFN-α therapy in all patients. In addition, CD8 T cells from NR patients expressed a higher exhaustion status at baseline. Finally, SVR patients exhibited higher proliferative response against both HIV and HCV antigens at baseline. Altogether, SVR correlated with higher expression of CD127, lower T cell exhaustion status and better HIV and HCV proliferative responses at baseline. Such factors might be used as non-invasive methods to predict the success of IFN-based therapies in co-infected individuals. "

This study aimed to describe the frequency of primary mutations associated with HIV-1 drug resistance and the prevalence of genetic HIV subtypes in a population of vertically infected children before the initiation of HAART. At the time of genotypic testing, the median age was 6.0 years (IQR 25-75%: 3.8-9.2) and the median age at admission was 3.84 years (IQR 25-75%: 1.23-6.11). Antepartum maternal ARV exposure for PMTCT occurred for three (7.3%) mothers. According to the WHO criteria, primary ARV resistance mutations were detected in four out of 41 (9.8%) children. Subtype B was the most prevalent (63.4%). The relatively high prevalence of primary HIV-1 DRMs in this cohort of perinatally infected children in Brazil supports the local recommendation to perform resistance testing in all newly diagnosed children, regardless of age at diagnosis and antenatal ARV exposure."
Doc No.876,8133,negative/unlabeled,8.078676,In vitro induction of HIV-1 replication in resting CD4(+) T cells derived from individuals with undetectable plasma viremia upon stimulation with human T-cell leukemia virus type I.,"Microbial coinfections have been associated with transient bursts of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viremia in patients. In this study we investigated whether human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), another human retrovirus that is prevalent among certain HIV-infected populations, can induce HIV-1 replication in patients who had been successfully treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy. We demonstrate that supernatants from HTLV-I-producing MT-2 cells can induce in vitro replication of HIV-1 from highly purified, resting CD4(+) T cells obtained from individuals with undetectable plasma viremia. Depletion of proinflammatory cytokines from the supernatants reduced, but did not abrogate, the ability to induce HIV-1 replication, indicating that other factors such as HTLV-I Tax or Env also have a role. The HTLV-I-mediated effect does not require productive infection: exposure to heat-inactivated HTLV-I virions, purified Tax protein, or HTLV-I Env glycoprotein also induced expression of HIV-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coculture of resting CD4(+) T cells with autologous CD8(+) T cells markedly inhibits the HTLV-I-induced virus replication. Our results suggest that coinfection with HTLV-I may induce viral replication in the latent viral reservoirs; however, CD8(+) T cells may play an important role in controlling the spread of virus upon microbial stimulation."

Thus, a therapy that specifically reduces HBsAg serum levels could be used in combination therapy with nucleos(t)ide drugs or permit therapeutic vaccination for the treatment of HBV infection. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel triazolo-pyrimidine inhibitors (1, 3, and 4) of HBsAg cellular secretion, with activity against drug-resistant HBV variants. Extensive SAR led to substantial improvements in the EC(50) of the parent compound, 5 (HBF-0259), with the best being 3c, with EC(50) = 1.4 ± 0.4 μM, SI ≥ 36. The lead candidates, both 1a (PBHBV-001) and 3c (PBHBV-2-15), were well-tolerated in both normal and HBV-transgenic mice and exhibited acceptable pharmacokinetics and bioavailability in Sprague-Dawley rats."

We recruited 128 patients living with HIV from Sansai Hospital, a community hospital in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and collected data through structured interviews. All forms of HIV-related stigma considered in this study (personalized experience, disclosure, negative self-image, and public attitudes) were negatively correlated with adherence to anti-retroviral regimens. Multiple linear regression indicated that total HIV-related stigma was more predictive of treatment adherence than any individual stigma type, after adjusting for socio-demographic and health characteristics. Tests of interaction showed that social support did not appear to moderate the association between HIV stigma and treatment adherence. Our findings suggest that community and government efforts to improve public perceptions about people living with HIV might promote treatment adherence behaviors among HIV-positive patients. "

Previously, we reported on a trial of 75 HIV+ patients who were blindly randomized to receive treatment with drug or placebo (N=25 to each of paroxetine, imipramine, or placebo). Forty-one individuals completed the entire trial (placebo = 14, antidepressant = 27). In this study, we assessed HRQoL using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ) and the Social Adjustment Scale (SAS) at baseline and the end of the trial (12 weeks) using a random effects model to estimate treatment effects. HIV/AIDS patients with a major depressive disorder who completed the clinical trial demonstrated a reduction in depression with response to treatment and a significant improvement in HRQoL with the exception of work and financial functioning. Effective management of depression in HIV/AIDS patients is important, especially with the importance of adherence in current HIV/AIDS antiviral therapy. HRQoL improved in patients regardless of drug or response group and as a function of being in this trial suggesting that medications may not be required to affect HRQoL outcomes and that disease management aspects of care are important."

Subjects were identified from the REACH cohort who were not on antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year and whose baseline CD4(+) T cells were >300 cells/mm(3). Biomedical and demographic characteristics of the subjects at the start of the study period were evaluated as predictors of CD4(+) T cell loss in univariate and multivariate models. Two-thirds of the 99 subjects meeting the selection criteria were female and 87% were black or Hispanic similar to the REACH cohort as a whole. Higher absolute CD8(+) CD38(+) T cell counts at the start of the assessment period were associated with a greater rate of loss of CD4(+) T cells. HIV-1 RNA viral load was among other potential predictors of HIV-1 disease progression that had no association with the rate of CD4(+) T cell loss in this cohort. This study extends the observed association of higher CD8(+) CD38(+) T cells numbers being predictive of HIV-1 disease progression into predominantly female, minority youth."

Therefore, our objective was to determine the scale of regional migration and its association with adherence patterns over time among HIV-infected individuals in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Participants initiated HAART in August 1996-November 2004, and were followed until November 2005. Adherence was defined as the number of days worth of antiretrovirals dispensed divided by the number of days of follow-up (expressed as a percentage), and considered a binary time-dependent outcome: 'non-adherence' (less than 95%) versus 'adherence' (95% or more). Migration was calculated as the cumulative number of times a patient's residential address changed during the course of treatment, and treated as a time-dependent variable. Non-linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the association between migration and adherence over time. All analyses were adjusted for relevant fixed and time-dependent variables. A total of 2421 participants were followed during the study period. Descriptive analysis demonstrated high stability in adherence over time, with more than 55% of patients moving at least once during the course of their treatment. We observed that those individuals migrating at least 3 times were 1.79 times more likely to be in the 'non-adherence' group than individuals who did not migrate. Our results demonstrate that migration in BC is not homogeneous across subpopulations. These results suggest that proactive strategies are needed to ensure that antiretroviral therapy remains available on a continued basis to highly migrant populations."

However, only limited data is available evaluating to which extent these proteins are targeted in natural infection and optimal cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes within these proteins have not been defined. In this study, CTL responses against HIV-1 Tat, Rev, Vpr, Vpu, and Vif were analyzed in 70 HIV-1 infected individuals and 10 HIV-1 negative controls using overlapping peptides spanning the entire proteins. Peptide-specific interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production was measured by Elispot assay and flow-based intracellular cytokine quantification. HLA class I restriction and cytotoxic activity were confirmed after isolation of peptide-specific CD8+ T-cell lines. All regulatory and accessory proteins served as targets for HIV-1- specific CTL and multiple CTL epitopes were identified in functionally important regions of these proteins. In certain individuals HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cell responses to these accessory and regulatory proteins contributed up to a third to the magnitude of the total HIV-1-specific CTL response. These data indicate that despite the small size of these proteins regulatory and accessory proteins are targeted by CTL in natural HIV-1 infection, and contribute importantly to the total HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. These findings are relevant for the evaluation of the specificity and breadth of immune responses during acute and chronic#10; infection, and will be useful for the design and testing of candidate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines."

This study is to identify patient characteristics that would be consistently associated with poor adherence across regimens and to understand the associations between initial and long-term adherence. HIV treatment-naïve patients initiated on protease inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or integrase strand transfer inhibitors were identified from the Veteran Health Administration system. Initial adherence measured as initial coverage ratio (ICR) and long-term adherence measured as thereafter 1-year proportion days covered (PDC) of base agent and complete regimen were estimated for each patient. The patients most likely to exhibit poor adherence were African-American, with lower socioeconomic status, and healthier. The initial coverage ratio of base agent and complete regimen were highly correlated, but the correlations between ICR and thereafter 1-year PDC were low. However, including initial adherence as a predictor in predictive model would substantially increase predictive accuracy of future adherence."

HIV-HBV coinfected patients who were treatment naïve and initiating HBV-active HAART were recruited as part of a prospective cohort study in Thailand and followed for 48 weeks (n = 24). Production of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in both HBV- and HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells was quantified using intracellular cytokine staining on whole blood. Following HBV-active HAART, the median (interquartile range) log decline from week 0 to week 48 for HBV DNA was 5.8 log (range, 3.4 to 6.7) IU/ml, and for HIV RNA it was 3.1 (range, 2.9 to 3.5) log copies/ml (P < 0.001 for both). The frequency of HIV Gag-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses significantly decreased (IFN-gamma, P < 0.001; TNF-alpha, P = 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant change in the frequency (IFN-gamma, P = 0.21; TNF-alpha, P = 0.61; and IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, P = 0.11) or magnitude (IFN-gamma, P = 0.13; TNF-alpha, P = 0.13; and IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, P = 0.13) of HBV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses over 48 weeks of HBV-active HAART. Of the 14 individuals who were HBV e antigen (HBeAg) positive, 5/14 (36%) lost HBeAg during the 48 weeks of follow-up. HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected in 4/5 (80%) of patients prior to HBeAg loss. Results from this study show no sustained change in the HBV-specific CD8(+) T-cell response following HBV-active HAART. These findings may have implications for the duration of treatment of HBV in HIV-HBV coinfected patients, particularly in HBeAg-positive disease."
Doc No.885,7278,negative/unlabeled,8.051359,Anti-retroviral drug resistance-associated mutations among non-subtype B HIV-1-infected Kenyan children with treatment failure.,"Recently increased availability of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has mitigated HIV-1/AIDS prognoses especially in resource poor settings. The emergence of ART resistance-associated mutations from non-suppressive ART has been implicated as a major cause of ART failure. Reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI)-resistance mutations among 12 non-subtype B HIV-1-infected children with treatment failure were evaluated by genotypically analyzing HIV-1 strains isolated from plasma obtained between 2001 and 2004. A region of pol-RT gene was amplified and at least five clones per sample were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed HIV-1 subtype A1 (n = 7), subtype C (n = 1), subtype D (n = 3), and CRF02_AG (n = 1). Before treatment, 4 of 12 (33.3%) children had primary RTI-resistance mutations, K103N (n = 3, ages 5-7 years) and Y181C (n = 1, age 1 year). In one child, K103N was found as a minor population (1/5 clones) before treatment and became major (7/7 clones) 8 months after RTI treatment. In 7 of 12 children, M184V appeared with one thymidine-analogue-associated mutation (TAM) as the first mutation, while the remaining 5 children had only TAMs appearing either individually (n = 2), or as TAMs 1 (M41L, L210W, and T215Y) and 2 (D67N, K70R, and K219Q/E/R) appearing together (n = 3). These results suggest that ""vertically transmitted"" primary RTI-resistance mutations, K103N and Y181C, can persist over the years even in the absence of drug pressure and impact RTI treatment negatively, and that appearing patterns of RTI-resistance mutations among non-subtype B HIV-1-infected children could possibly be different from those reported in subtype B-infected children."

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) among antiretroviral (ARV)-naive HIV-infected pregnant women in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ARV-naive pregnant women were recruited at Hospital Geral de Nova Iguacu (HGNI), Rio de Janeiro, from 2005 to 2008. HIV genotyping was carried out using ViroSeq (Abbott v. 2.0). TDRM were detected using the Calibrated Population Resistance Tool-CPR v. 6.0.The prevalence of mutations associated with resistance in the protease and reverse transcriptase regions of the HIV genome were assessed in samples collected prior to initiation of ARV prophylaxis or treatment. Among 238 eligible specimens that were collected, 197 samples were successfully amplified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Eighty-one percent of women were infected with HIV subtype B, 10% with subtype F1 viruses, 1.0% with subtype C virus, and 8.0% with recombinant forms of the virus. The prevalence of HIV TDRM was 5.6% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 2.0% for nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and 3.0% for protease inhibitors. The overall prevalence of any drug resistance was 10.7%. There were no multiclass resistant strains identified in the analyzed samples. The prevalence of HIV TDRM among the pregnant women in our cohort was moderate. Resistance testing should be encouraged in Rio de Janeiro, among other locations, for all HIV-infected pregnant women prior to prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV."
Doc No.887,9090,negative/unlabeled,8.043344,Generation and characterization of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mutant resistant to an HIV-1 protease inhibitor.,"A synthetic peptide, RPI 312, that specifically inhibits the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) showed a potent inhibition on virus production, maturation, and infectivity. Treatment with this agent prevented the cleavage of Gag protein at the site between p17 and p24 in HIV-1 chronically infected MOLT-4 cells as well as in the released virus. Passage of HIV-1 in the presence of gradually increasing concentrations of this protease inhibitor resulted in emergence of a variant that could evade the drug effects. In the resistant variant the maturation of Gag proteins appeared normal, but its infectivity was reduced compared with that of the parent virus. The nucleotides coding the amino acids at and around the cleavage site between Gag proteins p17 and p24 were not changed. One point mutation (A-->G) at site 2082 of the pol gene that resulted in one amino acid change at site 84 of the protease from isoleucine to valine (I-84-->V) could be detected in the resistant variant. An HIV-1 infectious DNA clone with the I-84-->V mutation also showed reduced sensitivity to this protease inhibitor. The findings that the resistant variant had lower infectivity and was still affected by higher doses of the drug support the speculation that resistance to protease inhibitors may not be as problematic as other drug resistance."

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are known to play an important role in controlling HIV-1 replication, which has led to an increasing interest in augmenting conventional antiretroviral therapy with therapeutic vaccination. The successful development of a therapeutic vaccine will rely on the ability to correlate an aspect of the immune response with clinical outcome. In this study, the CD8(+) T cell maturation status of antigen-specific cells in models of well and poorly controlled virus infections were compared, to show that a memory phenotype predominates when antigen loads are absent or low. In HIV-1 infection, the emergence of memory CD8(+) T cells was found to occur only in individuals with highly suppressed viral replication for an extended duration. Such assessments of the immune response may provide a refined measure of virus control."

Information regarding health status, immigration status, and the use of medical services was obtained from all HIV-infected undocumented and recently immigrated individuals who sought services from a Southern California nonprofit agency between July 1, 1990 and December 31, 1990. A total of 54 such individuals presented for services. Thirteen individuals reported participating in shared needle usage for the administration of medication or vitamins, in addition to other known risk factors for HIV. Only one of these 13 individuals had access to nonemergency medical care. Additional research is necessary to determine the reasons for these needle sharing behaviors. Educational outreach is needed to address these behaviors as a possible risk factor for HIV transmission."
Doc No.890,2530,negative/unlabeled,8.041605,Resistance surveillance in chronic hepatitis B patients treated with adefovir dipivoxil for up to 60 weeks.,"Current therapies for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection do not provide adequate long-term control of viral replication in the majority of patients. Monotherapy with nucleoside analogs, such as lamivudine and famciclovir, is effective for short periods but results in the emergence of drug-resistant HBV in a substantial number of patients within 1 year of therapy. Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) has demonstrated clinical activity against wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV, but it is unclear whether resistance mutations will emerge after long-term therapy with this drug. To determine whether extended treatment with ADV led to the emergence of drug-resistant populations of HBV, we analyzed virus isolated from patients currently enrolled in a long-term open-label study. The reverse transcriptase domain of HBV polymerase was amplified and sequenced from patients that had received a cumulative exposure of up to 60 weeks of ADV. During our analyses, several previously unreported amino acid substitutions were observed in the reverse transcriptase domain of HBV. Importantly, none of the observed mutations occurred in more than 1 patient, nor were they associated with an adefovir-resistant phenotype in vitro. Furthermore, none of the patients from whom these mutant viruses were isolated had evidence of virologic rebound. In conclusion, these results, although based on a limited number of patients, suggest that treatment with ADV does not lead to the emergence of resistant virus after up to 60 weeks of therapy."
Doc No.891,5369,negative/unlabeled,8.041203,"Prevalence of S gene mutations within the major hydrophilic region of hepatitis B virus in patients in Dongguan, southern China.","HBsAg point mutations within the major hydrophilic region (MHR) have frequently been reported to be associated with diagnostic failure, vaccine escape and immunotherapy escape. However, the prevalence of escape mutations in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients has not been systematically studied in patients from southern China within the past decade. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of escape mutations within the MHR of hepatitis B virus in patients in Dongguan, southern China. Between June 2015 and May 2016, 391 patients who were chronically infected with HBV were enrolled in the study, including 240 patients with the genotype B strain and 151 with the genotype C strain. The most frequent mutated position was s126 (4.3%), followed by s100 (3.3%), s101 (2.8%), s133 (2.8%), s145 (2.3%), s120 (2.0%) and s129 (1.8%). Furthermore, the mutations sY100C, sQ101R/K, sS114A, sP120T, sT/I126A/N/S, sQ129R, sM133L/T/S and sG145R/A were prevalent in at least one genotype, with a frequency higher than 1%, which indicated that these mutations were relatively common. In addition, sQ101K/R was found only in genotype C isolates (P < 0.05), and sT126A was only discovered in genotype B isolates (P = 0.047), indicating that such mutations were genotype-associated mutations. Notably, combinations of escape mutations within the MHR were also frequently discovered in genotypes B (5.0%) and C (6.6%), with no significant difference (P = 0.498). These results indicated that we should increase the surveillance HBsAg mutations among HBV-infected patients in China."
Doc No.892,1603,negative/unlabeled,8.03903,Impact of the central polypurine tract on the kinetics of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vector transduction.,"Lentiviral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) show great promise as gene carriers for future gene therapy. Insertion of a fragment containing the central polypurine tract (cPPT) in HIV-1 vector constructs is known to enhance transduction efficiency drastically, reportedly by facilitating the nuclear import of HIV-1 cDNA through a central DNA flap. We have studied the impact of the cPPT on the kinetics of HIV-1 vector transduction by real-time PCR. The kinetics of total HIV-1 DNA, two-long-terminal-repeat (2-LTR) circles, and, by an Alu-PCR, integrated proviral DNA were monitored. About 6 to 12 h after transduction, the total HIV-1 DNA reached a maximum level, followed by a steep decrease. The 2-LTR circles peaked after 24 to 48 h and were diluted upon cell division. Integration of HIV-1 DNA was first detected at 12 h postinfection. When HIV-1 vectors that contained the cPPT were used, DNA synthesis was similar but a threefold higher amount of 2-LTR circles was detected, confirming the impact on nuclear import. Moreover, a 10-fold increase in the amount of integrated DNA was observed in the presence of the cPPT. Only in the absence of the cPPT was a saturation in 2-LTR circle formation seen at a high multiplicity of infection, suggesting a role for the cPPT in overcoming a barrier to the nuclear import of HIV-1 DNA. A major effect of the central DNA flap on the juxtaposition of both LTRs is unlikely, since transduction with HIV-1 vectors containing ectopic cPPT fragments resulted in increased amounts of 2-LTR circles as well as integrated DNA. Inhibitors of transduction by cPPT-containing HIV vectors were also studied by real-time PCR. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine (AZT) and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor alpha-APA clearly inhibited viral DNA synthesis, whereas integrase inhibitors such as the diketo acid L-708,906 and the pyranodipyrimidine V-165 specifically inhibited integration."

Unfortunately the search for explanatory factors for nonadherence is still not fully developed, particularly in the area of religion and spirituality. Extant literature suggests that church attendance, religious practices and spiritual beliefs may improve health and generally benefit patients. However, religious beliefs may also play a negative role in treatment adherence due to the stigma attached to HIV disease, particularly in geographical areas and in population subgroups where religious practices are strong. In this exploratory study, HIV-positive individuals (n = 306) in a southern state were surveyed as to their attitudes and beliefs surrounding HIV disease and adherence with medical treatment for the disease. The results indicate that multiple factors influence adherence with treatment and that certain religious practices are positively associated with adherence, but certain religious beliefs are negatively related to adherence. The findings of this study reinforce the importance of remembering and addressing a patient's religious beliefs as a part of medical care."
Doc No.894,4844,negative/unlabeled,8.034665,Activation of HIV-1 from latent infection via synergy of RUNX1 inhibitor Ro5-3335 and SAHA.,"A major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 infection is the presence of a pool of long-lived, latently infected CD4+ memory T-cells. The search for treatments to re-activate latent HIV to aid in clearance is hindered by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that lead to transcriptional silencing of viral gene expression in host cells. Here we identify a previously unknown role for RUNX1 in HIV-1 transcriptional latency. The RUNX proteins, in combination with the co-factor CBF-β, are critical transcriptional regulators in T-cells. RUNX1 strongly modulates CD4 expression and contributes to CD4+ T-cell function. We show that RUNX1 can bind DNA sequences within the HIV-1 LTR and that this binding represses transcription. Using patient samples we show a negative correlation between RUNX1 expression and viral load. Furthermore, we find that pharmacologic inhibition of RUNX1 by a small molecule inhibitor, Ro5-3335, synergizes with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) to enhance the activation of latent HIV-1 in both cell lines and PBMCs from patients. Our findings indicate that RUNX1 and CBF-β cooperate in cells to modulate HIV-1 replication, identifying for the first time RUNX1 as a cellular factor involved in HIV-1 latency. This work highlights the therapeutic potential of inhibitors of RUNX1 to re-activate virus and aid in clearance of HIV-1. "

Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations, namely A98G and K103N, were observed in two separate sequences. In addition, three study sequences displayed three separate HIV-1 protease minor resistance mutations-L10I, A71T, and T74S. These preliminary data from Pune, India, reporting the presence of HIVDR in treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected children, reinforces the need to conduct large-scale studies to assess the prevalence of primary HIVDR in the pediatric population, which in turn will aid in planning protocols and policies related to antiretroviral treatment for the pediatric population.

Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a key T helper 2 cytokine with various immune-modulating functions including induction of immunoglobulin E (IgE) production in B cells, downregulation of CCR5 and upregulation of CXCR4, the main co-receptors for HIV. Our objective is to investigate whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-4 promoter 589 C/T and IL-4 Ralpha I50V affect the susceptibility to HIV infection and its progression to AIDS in North Indian individuals. The study population consisted of 180 HIV-1 seropositive (HSP) stratified on the basis of disease severity (stage I, II, III), 50 HIV-1 exposed seronegative (HES), and 305 HIV-1 seronegative (HSN) individuals. The subjects were genotyped for IL-4 589 C/T promoter polymorphism and IL-4 Ralpha I50V by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism. The results showed that IL-4 589 C/T was not associated with the risk of HIV infection and disease progression. However, the IL-4Ralpha I50 allele and genotype was significantly increased in HSP compared to HSN and HSP and was associated with risk of HIV infection. The frequency of IL-4Ralpha I50 allele in the HSP group was higher than in HSN (76.11 vs. 64.75%; P = 0.000; OR = 1.734) and HES (76.11% vs. 62.00%; P = 0.007; OR = 1.953). Homozygous IL-4Ralpha I50I genotype was significantly increased in HSP group compared with HSN (58.88% vs. 44.26%; P = 0.002; OR = 1.804) and HES (58.88% vs. 42.00%; P = 0.038; OR = 1.978). The present study for the first time suggests an association of IL-4Ralpha I50 allele with increased likelihood of HIV-1 infection in North Indian population. Further studies are required to confirm these findings and understand the effect of IL-4Ralpha polymorphism on the outcome of HIV-1 infection."

We report here that both clinical and immunological categorizations of pediatric slow progressors based on the 1994 CDC criteria for symptom and immunosupression severity levels yield similar immunological findings: declining proportions of CD4 T cells are associated with increasing proportions of CD8 and CD4-CD8- T cells and with declining IL-2, -5, and -10 production levels by peripheral blood cells in response to the T cell-dependent mitogen, phytohemagglutinin, but not to the T and B cell-dependent mitogen from pokeweed. The latter cross-sectional results point to potential prognostic and nosologic markers and therapeutic targets among HIV-infected pediatric slow progressors. Longitudinal studies will help to assess further the relevance of these findings."

Fifty-seven percent of the HIV-infected group had CMV-specific cytolytic activity in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) against targets expressing CMV pp65. Both interferon (IFN)-gamma secretion by CD8(+) T cells and the frequency of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-tetramer-positive T cells in HLA-A*0201-positive HIV-infected subjects correlated with CMV-specific cytolysis. In contrast, PBMC from healthy CMV-seropositive donors did not have either measurable CMV-specific cytolysis or secretion of IFN-gamma without in vitro stimulation. The T helper response to CMV antigens was vigorous in healthy CMV-seropositive donors but low in the cohort of HIV-infected patients. Potent CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to CMV in HIV-infected patients receiving HAART is the converse of what is found in healthy CMV-seropositive subjects and may be the predominant adaptive immune response against CMV in HIV-infected patients."

The use of primary CD4+ T cells with variable infectivity as targets for such studies has significant limitations, and immortal autologous cells with high levels of CD4 expression that can be consistently infected with HIV-1 would be of much greater utility. Therefore, we transduced Epstein-Barr-virus-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) with a retroviral vector, LT4SN, containing the human CD4 gene. Stable LCL in which more than 95% of cells expressed membrane CD4 were obtained. Aliquots were infected with HIV-1, and, after 4 to 7 days, nearly all of the cells contained cytoplasmic gag and produced high levels of p24 antigen. The ability of major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD8+ CTL to lyse such HIV-1-infected CD4-transduced LCL (LCL-CD4HIV-1) was evaluated. These autologous targets were lysed by CTL generated from an HIV-1-uninfected vaccinee over a broad range of effector-to-target ratios. Similarly, the LCL-CD4HIV-1 were efficiently lysed by fresh circulating CTL from HIV-1-infected individuals, as well as by CTL activated by in vitro stimulation. Both HIV-1 env- and gag-specific CTL effectors lysed LCL-CD4HIV-1, consistent with the cellular expression of both HIV-1 genes. The LCL-CD4HIV also functioned as stimulator cells, and thus are capable of amplifying CTL against multiple HIV-1 gene products in HIV-1-infected individuals. The ability to produce HIV-1-susceptible autologous immortalized cell lines that can be employed as target cells should enable a more detailed evaluation of vaccine-induced CTL against both homologous and disparate HIV-1 strains. Furthermore, the use of LCL-CD4HIV-1 should facilitate the analysis of the range of HIV-1 gene products recognized by CTL in seropositive persons."

HBV DNA and HBV genotypic resistance test were performed. Patients were categorized into two groups: with and without HBV-DR. There were 84 patients with a mean age (standard deviation [SD]) of 42.2 (10.2) years and 77% were males. Median (range) duration of ART and lamivudine use was 46 (3-177) and 40 (3-140) months, respectively. Median (range) CD4 cell count was 352 (49-790) cells/mm(3). Of all, 19 (23%) had HBV-DR with a median (range) HBV DNA of 2.56 x 10(7) (2.54 x 10(3)-11 x 10(7)) IU/mL. In univariate analysis, there were no differences in age, gender, ART regimen, liver function test, anti-HBc antibody, anti-HCV antibody between the two groups. Patients with HBV-DR had a higher proportion of positive HBeAg (68.4% versus 3.8%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, positive HBeAg (odds ratio [OR) 16.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.31-83.60] and duration of lamivudine use [per 6-month increment, OR 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.36] were significant risk factors for HBV-DR. All 19 patients with HBV-DR had lamivudine resistance with the mutations as follows: M204V/I (95%), L180M/A181T (95%), L80V/I (47%), V173L (32%), and N236T (21%). Of these, 95%, 84%, 84%, and 0% of patients had HBV-DR to telbivudine, entecavir, adefovir, and tenofovir, respectively. HBV-DR is common in HBV/HIV-1 coinfected patients receiving lamivudine-containing ART without tenofovir. Positive HBeAg and longer duration of lamivudine use are risk factors for HBV-DR. In addition to lamivudine resistance, cross-resistance to other anti-HBV drugs is also frequently observed."

The drugs previously used for each patient were recorded and correlated with the mutations found in the samples. Viral load (VL) and CD4 count were also recorded. Only one patient had the wild type sequence. The most prevalent mutations were: 184V (59%), 41L (47.9%), 63P (53%), 215Y (50%), 36I (46%), 10I (35%), 67N (42%), 77I (37%), 90M (36%) and 210W (33%). A positive correlation between the number of previously used ARVs and the number of mutations was observed (p<0.05). Associations between mutations and ARV drugs were identified at positions 69, 118, 184 and 215 with previous exposure to NRTI, mutations at positions 98, 100, 103, 181 and 190 with previous NNRTI use and at positions 10, 20, 30, 46, 53, 54, 71, 73, 82, 84, 88 and 90 with previous PI therapy (p<0.05). Previous exposure to ARV drugs was associated with previous genotypic resistance to specific drugs, leading to treatment failure in HIV patients. Genotypic resistance was clearly associated with virological and immunological failure."

In latently infected cells, balance between viral silencing and reactivation relies on the nucleosomal organization of the integrated long terminal repeat (LTR). It is shown here that nucleosome nuc-1, which is located downstream of the TATA box, is specifically modified when latently infected cells are arrested in G(2) by chemical inducers. Notably, histones H3 and H4 are hyperacetylated, and this modification is associated with an increased LTR-driven transcription. nuc-1 hyperacetylation is also associated with the recruitment of histone acetyltransferase CBP and transcription factors NF-kappaB and c-Jun. NF-kappaB and/or c-Jun binding to the LTR in G(2)-arrested cells appears to be required for CBP recruitment as well as for nuc-1 remodeling and viral reactivation."

Transmission risk behavior, HAART-taking, and psychosocial distress of the growing population of Russian people living with HIV (PLH) in the HAART era are understudied. Participants of a systematically-recruited cross-sectional sample of 492 PLH in St. Petersburg completed measures of sexual and drug injection practices, adherence, perceived discrimination, and psychosocial distress. Since learning of their status, 58% of participants had partners of HIV-negative or unknown serostatus (mean = 5.8). About 52% reported unprotected intercourse with such partners, with 30% of acts unprotected. Greater perceived discrimination predicted lower condom use. A 47% of IDU PLH still shared needles, predicted by having no primary partner, lower education, and more frequently-encountered discrimination. Twenty-five percentage of PLH had been refused general health care, 11% refused employment, 7% fired, and 6% forced from family homes. Thirty-nine percentage of participants had probable clinical depression, 37% had anxiety levels comparable to psychiatric inpatients, and social support was low. Of the 54% of PLH who were offered HAART, 16% refused HAART regimens, and 5% of those on the therapy took less than 90% of their doses. Comprehensive community services for Russian PLH are needed to reduce AIDS-related psychosocial distress and continued HIV transmission risk behaviors. Social programs should reduce stigma and discrimination, and promote social integration of affected persons and their families."

Not surprising therefore overall, drug users were the heaviest users of the inpatient facilities (74% of the discharges and 65% of the bed days) although homosexuals had the highest discharge rate (114 per 100 person years) and rate of bed day use (1654 days per 100 person years). Immunodeficiency (CD4 count < 200 cells/ul) and a clinical diagnosis of AIDS were both associated with greater inpatient and outpatient resource use compared to those without immunodeficiency (CD4 count > or = 200 CD4 cells/ul) or AIDS. Gender effects were complex; the ALOS for women was increased for all risk groups whatever the CD4 count whilst there was no consistent trend of more resource use for women by risk group. Drug users were the heaviest overall users of the local hospice (84% of all admissions, 83% of the bed days and a discharge rate of 76.4 per 100 person years), more than double the rates experienced by the other risk groups. Thus both clinical and immunological staging (AIDS or a CD4 count < 200 cells/ul) were associated with increased resource use in HIV infection and estimates of resource use for AIDS need to be increased by around one-third to take into account hospice use. Despite the preponderance of drug users in Edinburgh, comparisons with other centres did not reveal increased resource use."
Doc No.905,5795,positive/labeled,7.984671,Prevalence of drug resistance mutations and non-B subtypes in newly diagnosed HIV-1 patients in Denmark.,"The aim of this study was to monitor the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive individuals in Denmark. In addition we assessed the prevalence of non-B subtypes based on phylogenetic analysis of the pol gene. Plasma samples from 104 newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive patients were obtained in the year 2000. The entire protease gene and 320 amino acids of the reverse transcriptase gene were genotyped. Sequences were obtained from 97 patients. No subjects displayed primary resistance mutations in the protease gene, whereas all carried 1 or more secondary mutations. Resistance mutations in the RT-gene associated with NRTI-resistance were found in 1 patient, who was infected with zidovudine resistant HIV-1 harbouring the M41L mutation in combination with T215S and L210S. The T215S mutation has been showed to be associated with reversion of zidovudine resistance. The T215S mutation was found in 1 additional patient. The subtype distribution was subtype B 59%, C 18%, A 8%, CRF02_AG 5%, CRF01_AE 4%, D 3% and G 2%. We found 2 patients (2%) with mutations associated with resistance in the RT-gene and none in the protease gene indicating a low prevalence of resistant HIV-1 in Denmark in the year 2000."

The Microbicide Trials Network 009 study assessed the prevalence of drug-resistance mutations among women at clinical sites in Durban, South Africa who tested seropositive for HIV-1 at screening for the VOICE trial. The objective of this paper was to identify characteristics and behaviors associated with drug resistance. Factors found to be significantly associated with increased resistance were high perceived risk of getting HIV and prior participation in a microbicide trial, a likely proxy for familiarity with the health care system. Two factors were found to be significantly associated with reduced resistance: having a primary sex partner and testing negative for HIV in the past year. Other variables hypothesized to be important in identifying women with resistant virus, including partner or friend on ART who shared with the participant and being given antiretrovirals during pregnancy or labor, or the proxy variable-number of times given birth in a health facility-were not significantly associated. The small number of participants with resistant virus and the probable underreporting of sensitive behaviors likely affected our ability to construct a comprehensive profile of the type of HIV-positive women at greatest risk of developing resistance mutations.

To determine factors associated with zidovudine (ZDV) receipt among HIV-infected pregnant women we merged three data sets for women in New Jersey in 1995-1997, identifying 395 HIV-infected pregnant women. Half received two arms of ZDV prophylaxis. Attendance at five or more prenatal visits was the strongest independent factor related to ZDV receipt (OR 6.37, 95% CI 3.84, 10.57). Half (49.0%) had limited prenatal care. AIDS diagnosis, race/ethnicity, and drug use were also independently related to ZDV receipt. Post hoc analysis revealed that being unmarried, Black, multiparous, having no insurance, and illegal drug use were associated with limited prenatal care. Although the U.S. has seen reductions in HIV perinatal transmission, our research showed that HIV-infected women who did not get prenatal care were less likely to receive two arms of ZDV prophylaxis. A wide public health net that brings all women into care is necessary to reduce perinatal transmission further."

HIV-2 long terminal repeat (LTR) target sequences were detected in DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 84 of 86 (97%) individuals whereas HIV-2 integrase (pol) gene sequences were detected in 39 of 41 (95%) individuals. The use of LTR target sequences and recombinant Pfu DNA polymerase, rather than Taq polymerase, in a modified secondary amplification reaction mediated the incorporation of 35S-labeled nucleotides in a quantitative radiometric assay. This sensitive assay was used to quantify HIV-2 proviral DNA in clinical samples and compared well with estimations by limiting end-point dilution of target molecules. A linear response between counts and the number of copies amplified from serial dilutions of pROD10 plasmid DNA (3-2000 copies) yielded a standard curve to allow extrapolation to clinical data. Increased levels of HIV-2 proviral DNA, expressed as copies per 10(5) CD4-positive lymphocytes, were associated with declining CD4 count in 63 adult patients (Spearman rank correlation, r = -0.71, n = 63, p < 0.001) and with the occurrence of HIV-related clinical disease. Kruskall-Wallis analysis of variance analysis showed the mean proviral copy number (log10) to be significantly different between groups (p < 0.001) where CD4 counts were grouped as < 200/mm3 (3.4 +/- 1.05 copies), 200-500/mm3 (2.84 +/- 0.93 copies), and > 500/mm3 (1.88 +/- 0.43 copies).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The frequency of drug resistance mutations (DRM) and the genetic variability of HIV-1 isolates from newly diagnosed HIV-infected pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics of the Lucrecia Paim and Augusto N'Gangula maternities, Luanda-Angola, were determined. Thirty five out of 57 samples (61.4%) were sequenced and one mutation associated with resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was detected. Additionally, two mutations associated with resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were also detected. No primary mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PI) were found. Subtypes A1, C, D, F1, G, H, CRF 13, CRF 37, and other mosaics were detected."
Doc No.910,9898,negative/unlabeled,7.9758716,Requirement for integrase during reverse transcription of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and the effect of cysteine mutations of integrase on its interactions with reverse transcriptase.,"Retroviral integrase catalyzes the essential step of integrating a double-stranded DNA copy of the viral genome into a host cell chromosome. Mutational studies have revealed that integrase is involved in additional steps of viral replication, but the mechanism for the pleiotropic effect is not well characterized. Since Cys residues generally play crucial roles in protein structure and function, we introduced Cys-to-Ser substitutions at positions 56, 65, and 130 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase to determine their effects on integration activity and viral replication. None of the substitutions significantly affected the enzymatic activities in vitro. When introduced into the NL4-3 molecular clone of HIV-1, mutant viruses encoding Cys mutations at positions 56 and 65 of integrase replicated similarly to the wild-type virus in CD4(+)-T-cell lines, whereas the C130S-containing virus was noninfectious. The entry and postintegration steps of the viral life cycle for all mutant viruses were normal, and all had particle-associated reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. However, early reverse-transcribed DNA products were absent in the lysate of cells infected with the C130S mutant virus, indicating that the mutation abolished the ability of the virus to initiate endogenous reverse transcription. Coimmunoprecipitation using purified integrase and RT showed that the C-terminal domain of wild-type HIV-1 integrase interacted with RT. The interaction between integrase and RT was not affected in the presence of a reducing or alkylating agent, suggesting that the interaction did not involve a disulfide linkage. The C130S substitution within the core region may disrupt the protein recognition interface of the C-terminal domain and abolish its ability to interact with RT. Our results indicate that integrase plays an important role during the reverse-transcription step of the viral life cycle, possibly through physical interactions with RT."
Doc No.911,7470,positive/labeled,7.975761,Stable and low prevalence of transmitted HIV type 1 drug resistance despite two decades of antiretroviral therapy in Hong Kong.,"Transmitted HIV resistance is of both clinical and public health importance. Baseline genotypic resistance testing was performed for HIV-1-infected treatment-naive patients who were newly diagnosed between 2003 and 2007 and attended the government HIV clinic in Hong Kong. International AIDS Society-USA mutation figures and the Stanford resistance interpretation algorithm were used to identify resistance mutations and drug susceptibility, respectively. The pattern and factors associated with resistance were examined. The presence of one or more IAS-USA resistance mutations was found in 26 (3.6%) of 731 patients over the 5-year study period. Overall, protease inhibitor (PI) resistance mutations were most common (16), followed by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (8) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (3). Resistance to drugs in one, two, and three classes was present in 25 (3.4%), 1 (0.1%), and 0, respectively. Seventy-eight (10.7%) had strains of reduced susceptibility, as predicted by the Stanford algorithm to display at least low-level resistance to one or more drugs of the three classes. Intermediate or high-level resistance was found in 1.6% overall, and in descending order for NRTIs, PIs, and NNRTIs. There was no temporal trend of increase in resistance. Sex between men, Chinese ethnicity, and lower baseline CD4 were associated with harboring resistant strains as elucidated by either method. We conclude that transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance is uncommon in up to two decades of antiretroviral therapy in Hong Kong. The situation has to be continually monitored for any change in significance."
Doc No.912,4247,positive/labeled,7.9725537,"Alcohol use and immune reconstitution among HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy in Nairobi, Kenya.","Studies on the effects of alcohol use on HIV disease progression have been contradictory, with at least one study finding a positive effect of low alcohol consumption on CD4 count. In addition, most such studies have taken place in the developed West. We investigated the association between alcohol use and immune reconstitution through CD4 count response among HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at an urban sub-Saharan African clinic. This was a retrospective cohort study of treatment-naïve HIV-infected adults initiating ART in Nairobi, Kenya and followed for 12 months between January 2009 and December 2012. At enrollment, a standardized questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic variables and alcohol consumption. CD4 count was measured every six months. Linear regression models assessed the association between CD4 count and alcohol consumption, categorized as abstinent, moderate, or hazardous. Overall, 854 participants were included, 522 of which were women, with 85 (25.6%) men and 50 (9.6%) women reporting any alcohol use, and 8 (2.4%) men and 7 (1.3%) women reporting hazardous drinking. At baseline, alcohol use was associated with higher education and socioeconomic status. Median CD4 count was higher among alcohol users compared to those who abstained at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post-ART initiation, although this was only significant at 6 months. There were no differences in adherence between abstainers and drinkers. While overall alcohol use was significantly associated with higher CD4 counts, moderate and hazardous use treated separately were not. We conclude that, while alcohol use was associated with higher CD4 counts at 12 months post-ART, the mechanism for this association is unclear but may reflect unmeasured socioeconomic or nutritional differences. Additional research is required on the specific drinking patterns of this population and the types of alcoholic beverages consumed to clarify this relationship."
Doc No.913,1594,negative/unlabeled,7.9706826,Comparative analysis of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in lymph nodes and peripheral blood of simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus monkeys.,"Most studies of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have been confined to the evaluation of these effector cells in the peripheral blood. What has not been clear is the extent to which CTL activity in the blood actually reflects this effector cell function in the lymph nodes, the major sites of HIV-1 replication. To determine the concordance between CTL activity in lymph nodes and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), CTL specific for simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac) have been characterized in lymph nodes of infected, genetically selected rhesus monkeys by using both Gag peptide-specific functional CTL assays and tetrameric peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule complex staining techniques. In studies of six chronically SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys, Gag epitope-specific functional lytic activity and specific tetrameric peptide-MHC class I staining were readily demonstrated in lymph node T lymphocytes. Although the numbers of tetramer-binding cells in some animals differed from those documented in their PBL, the numbers of tetramer-binding cells from these two different compartments were not statistically different. Phenotypic characterization of the tetramer-binding CD8(+) lymph node T lymphocytes of the infected monkeys demonstrated a high level of expression of the activation-associated adhesion molecules CD11a and CD49d, the Fas molecule CD95, and MHC class II-DR. These studies documented a low expression of the naive T-cell marker CD45RA and the adhesion molecule CD62L. This phenotypic profile of the tetramer-binding lymph node CD8(+) T cells was similar to that of tetramer-binding CD8(+) T cells from PBL. These observations suggest that characterization of AIDS virus-specific CTL activity by sampling of cells in the peripheral blood should provide a reasonable estimation of CTL in an individual's secondary lymphoid tissue."

These increases identified in the 49 seronegative homosexual men were manifest in all 164 homosexual subjects and 45 intravenous drug users (IVDU) positive for HIV-1 antibodies (HIV-1+), 19 patients with ARC, and 29 AIDS patients. Augmentation of plasma sCD8 antigen correlated with increases in both CD8+ and CD8+ CD38+ cells in HIV-1(-) homosexual men (r = 0.35, P less than 0.013; r = 0.48, P less than 0.0005; respectively) and the 258 HIV-1+ subjects (r = 0.25, P less than 0.0003; r = 0.33, P less than 0.0001, respectively). In vitro examination of unstimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from HIV-1+ homosexuals and IVDU confirmed the fivefold higher constitutive levels of cellular release of sCD8 antigen in these subjects compared to heterosexual controls. Inclusion of radiolabeled amino acids during the 3-day culture period in the presence or absence of phytohemagglutinin resulted in negligible levels of radioactivity associated with the sCD8 antigen indicative of a lack of de novo synthesis. Throughout clinical progression to AIDS, sCD8 antigen levels continued to escalate relative to the numbers of CD8+ cells bearing CD38+ antigen. The data confirm the interrelationship between sCD8+ antigen and CD8+ and CD8+ CD38+ cells."
Doc No.915,6199,negative/unlabeled,7.9696,Molecular footprint of drug-selective pressure in a human immunodeficiency virus transmission chain.,"Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission histories are invaluable models for investigating the evolutionary and transmission dynamics of the virus and to assess the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstructions. Here we have characterized an HIV-1 transmission chain consisting of nine infected patients, almost all of whom were treated with antiviral drugs at later stages of infection. Partial pol and env gp41 regions of the HIV genome were directly sequenced from plasma viral RNA for at least one sample from each patient. Phylogenetic analyses in pol using likelihood methods inferred an evolutionary history not fully compatible with the known transmission history. This could be attributed to parallel evolution of drug resistance mutations resulting in the incorrect clustering of multidrug-resistant virus. On the other hand, a fully compatible phylogenetic tree was reconstructed from the env sequences. We were able to identify and quantify the molecular footprint of drug-selective pressure in pol using maximum likelihood inference under different codon substitution models. An increased fixation rate of mutations in the HIV population of the multidrug-resistant patient was demonstrated using molecular clock modeling. We show that molecular evolutionary analyses, guided by a known transmission history, can reveal the presence of confounding factors like natural selection and caution should be taken when accurate descriptions of HIV evolution are required."
Doc No.916,4161,positive/labeled,7.967932,Influence of a vaccination schedule on viral load rebound and immune responses in successfully treated HIV-infected patients.,"Vaccination is recommended for HIV-infected patients. Transient increases of viral load (VL) and risk of developing resistance to HAART have been described. In addition, VL rebounds could increase HIV-specific immune responses. Twenty-six successfully treated HIV-infected adults were randomized to receive a vaccination schedule or placebo during 12 months. Afterward, HAART was discontinued. Influences of vaccination over VL, genotypic mutations, different T cell subsets, and HIV-1-specific immune responses were evaluated. Patients did not present any secondary effect. No differences in incidence of detectable VL determinations were detected between groups [relative risk 0.54 (95% CI 0.23-1.26)]. No relevant resistance mutations were detected. The vaccinated group showed a significant drop in CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.046) associated with increases in activated T cells. HIV-1-specific lymphoproliferative responses increased more in the vaccinated group during the vaccination period. Viral rebound dynamics after interrupting HAART were similar in both groups. A vaccination schedule in successfully treated HIV patients was safe, was not associated with an increase in detectable VL, and did not increase the risk of developing resistance mutations. However, it induced an increase in T cell activation and a drop in CD4(+) T cells, although these changes did not influence the VL rebound dynamics after HAART interruption."

Although TPV C(min) did not predict outcome in patients with less than five or more than eight baseline TPV-associated resistance mutations, TPV C(min) values were greater in responders than in nonresponders with five to seven baseline TPV-associated resistance mutations (38.8 vs. 13.8 g/ml, p = 0.017). Thus, therapeutic drug monitoring might be helpful in ensuring a viral response in this subset of patients."

We have studied ten subjects who have been asymptomatic with normal and stable CD4+ lymphocyte counts, despite 12 to 16 years of HIV-1 infection, to gain information on the determinants of nonprogression. Multiple methods were used to determine the viral load in their blood. Plasma cultures were uniformly negative for infectious virus. However, particle-associated HIV-1 RNA was detectable in four subjects using a sensitive branched DNA amplification assay. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), infectious HIV-1 was quantified in three subjects using a standard limiting-dilution culture method. Infectious virus was recovered from another subject using a CD8-depleted culture. In contrast, six subjects had no detectable infectious virus in PBMC. All had detectable viral DNA in PBMC by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay, but the copy numbers were low, ranging from 10 to 100 copies per 10(6) PBMC in all but two subjects. Overall, the viral burden in the plasma and PBMC of long-term survivors was orders of magnitude lower than those typically found in progressors. Possible mechanisms for low levels of HIV-1 in vivo were examined experimentally."
Doc No.919,8109,positive/labeled,7.9637766,Normalization of FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells in response to effective antiretroviral therapy.,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) blunt uncontrolled immune responses. In advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the total number of Tregs is decreased, but the proportion of T cells with a regulatory phenotype is highly variable. We studied CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T cells from patients successfully treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). The proportion of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) cells transiently increased and then decreased from a median of 13% at baseline to 5.1% at 48 weeks, similar to values in normal subjects. These data suggest that with effective therapy, the regulatory cell numbers normalize, and that the inflammatory signals driving their production may also abate."
Doc No.920,4289,negative/unlabeled,7.954031,Virus evolution during chronic hepatitis B virus infection as revealed by ultradeep sequencing data.,"Despite chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (CHB) being a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer, HBV evolution during CHB is not fully understood. Recent studies have indicated that virus diversity progressively increases along the course of CHB and that some virus mutations correlate with severe liver conditions such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Using ultradeep sequencing (UDS) data from an intrafamilial case, we detected such mutations at low frequencies among three immunotolerant patients and at high frequencies in an inactive carrier. Furthermore, our analyses indicated that the HBV population from the seroconverter patient underwent many genetic changes in response to virus clearance. Together, these data indicate a potential use of UDS for developing non-invasive biomarkers for monitoring disease changes over time or in response to specific therapies. In addition, our analyses revealed that virus clearance seemed not to require the virus effective population size to decline. A detailed genetic analysis of the viral lineages arising during and after the clearance suggested that mutations at or close to critical elements of the core promoter (enhancer II, epsilon encapsidation signal, TA2, TA3 and direct repeat 1-hormone response element) might be responsible for a sustained replication. This hypothesis requires the decline in virus load to be explained by constant clearance of virus-producing hepatocytes, consistent with the sustained progress towards serious liver conditions experienced by many CHB patients.

Doc No.921,4364,negative/unlabeled,7.948339,Enhanced replicative capacity and pathogenicity of HIV-1 isolated from individuals infected with drug-resistant virus and declining CD4+ T-cell counts.,"Virologic failure on continuous antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with variable changes in CD4 T-cell counts: peripheral CD4 T-cell counts decrease in conjunction with a resurgence of plasma virus (nonresponders) or remain stable or continue to increase despite ongoing virus replication (discordant responders). This study found that HIV-1 isolated from nonresponders had significantly greater replicative capacity in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as an enhanced ability to induce apoptosis in both HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected CD4 T cells compared with virus isolated from discordant responders. Enhanced replicative capacity in PBMCs of virus isolated from nonresponders was inhibited by AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist. Virus quasispecies isolated from PBMCs from nonresponders used both CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CX chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) for entry, in contrast to virus isolated from PBMCs from discordant responders, which predominantly used CCR5. In contrast, virus isolated from plasma from both groups predominantly used CCR5. In summary, although drug resistance may lead to impaired viral fitness, the capacity of virus quasispecies from PBMCs to use CXCR4 may have significant consequences on viral replicative capacity and potentially on clinical outcome."

The existence of HBV variants with primary antiviral resistance may be important for treatment choice. We studied two patients with chronic HBV infection by sequencing the HBV polymerase gene. They had adefovir- and tenofovir-related mutations in the viral polymerase, although they had never been treated. These mutations were rtV214A/rtN238T in one patient and rtA194T in the other. Thus, mutations in untreated patients deserve cautious surveillance. These data indicate that mutations that can theoretically confer adefovir or tenofovir resistance may emerge in treatment-naive patients."

The effect of adjunct HU on T cell proliferative responses and phenotypic markers was examined in a randomized study of 39 chronically HIV-1-infected patients with virological suppression on potent antiretroviral therapy. While patients in the HU arm showed modest declines in the median CD4(+) T cell counts (total, -151 cells/mm(3); naive, -91 cells/mm(3)), no significant differences were noted in the Candida, HIV-1 p24, and HIV-1 gp160 responses between the treatment arms following 24 weeks of therapy. In conclusion, although adjunct HU was associated with modest declines in the CD4(+) T cell counts, there was no significant adverse effect on helper T cell function. Further trials to address the role of HU in HIV-1 treatment may be appropriate after careful selection of HU dose and the adjunct drugs to avoid nonhematological toxicity."

As the epidemic grows there is an urgent need for effective therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines. Nonhuman primate models of immunodeficiency virus infection are essential for the preclinical evaluation of candidate vaccines. To interpret the results of these trials, comparative studies of the human and macaque immune responses are needed. Despite the widespread use of macaques to evaluate vaccines designed to elicit a CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, the efficiency with which CTL control immunodeficiency virus infections has not been compared between humans and macaques, largely because of difficulties in assaying the functional CTL response. We recently developed a method for estimating the rate at which CTLs kill cells productively infected with HIV-1 in humans in vivo. Here, using the same technique, we quantify the rate at which CTLs kill infected cells in macaque models of HIV infection. We show that CTLs kill productively infected cells significantly faster (P = 0.004) and that escape variants have significantly higher fitness costs (P = 0.003) in macaques compared with humans. These results suggest that it may be easier to elicit a protective CTL response in macaques than in humans and that vaccine studies conducted in macaques need to be interpreted accordingly."

In a set of 16 LTNPs, viral dating, DNA viral load, quasispecies heterogeneity and antibody (Ab) titres against gp160 and beta2 microglobulin (beta2m) were determined. Plasma viral RNA and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell numbers were estimated in more than three samples per patient. Host genetic characteristics, such as Delta32-CCR5 genotype and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype and supertypes, and clinical-epidemiological factors were evaluated. Dating of global populations and of DNA and RNA viral quasispecies identified two subsets of patients: one displaying only ancestral sequences and the other displaying predominantly modern sequences. The ancestral patients displayed a significant reduction in RNA and DNA viral loads, quasispecies heterogeneity, CD8+ cell number, anti-gp160 Ab titres and beta2m level, and they were also associated with better use of safe-sex practices and higher presence of the HLA sB58 supertype than the modern subset. Viral dating has therefore permitted the segregation of LTNPs into two subsets that show very different virological, immunological, host and clinical-epidemiological characteristics. Moreover, whereas the modern subset displayed low levels of virus replication, the ancestral group displayed not only a very limited virus replication, often to undetectable levels, but also very slow or arrested viral evolution, maintaining the close relationship of the viral population to the transmitted virus."

Doc No.927,4497,negative/unlabeled,7.9395413,Antiapoptotic effects of IL-15 on pulmonary Tc1 cells of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"In the early phases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease a T-cell alveolitis sustained by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) with anti-HIV activity occurs in the lung. With the progression of HIV disease, pulmonary CTL become infected and their cytotoxic activity declines. To investigate the potential causes leading to this phenomenon, we evaluated T cells obtained from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of 18 HIV-infected patients with T-cell alveolitis. BAL T cells were CD45R0+/CD8+ defined as Tc1 cells because they expressed cytoplasmic interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and were CXCR3+/IL-12Rbeta2+. Furthermore, they bore the interleukin (IL)- 15 receptor, Fas antigen, and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) type II. When cultured for 24 h highly purified BAL T cells showed an excessive spontaneous apoptosis; after activation with anti-CD3 or ionomycin, the proportion of T cells undergoing cell death increased. Interestingly, we found a direct relationship between the predisposition to undergo spontaneous apoptosis and the levels of Fas expression by BAL T cells. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) expressed high levels of IL-15 which paralleled the intensity of T-cell infiltration in most patients. The predisposition of CD8 T cells to undergo cell death was downregulated by the incubation with IL-15; the protective effect of the cytokine was dose-dependent. Nonetheless, AMs also expressed proapoptotic molecules, including membrane TNF-alpha (mTNF-alpha). Based on these observations it may be suggested that an excessive, spontaneous, and activation-induced apoptosis of pulmonary lymphocytes may be observed in HIV lung and that AMs are major regulators of T-cell homeostasis."

GB virus C (GBV-C) infection is associated with reduced T-cell activation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. T-cell activation and DNTCs were measured in HIV-infected subjects with a nondetectable HIV load. GBV-C-viremic subjects had significantly reduced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell activation (P = .003 and .034, respectively) and significantly increased DNTCs (P = .038), compared with nonviremic subjects. GBV-C load correlated with DNTC percentage (P = .004). Thus, GBV-C infection is associated with an increase in DNTCs, which may contribute to reduced immune activation during HIV infection."
Doc No.929,7104,negative/unlabeled,7.937273,CD38 expression on CD8 T lymphocytes as a marker of residual virus replication in chronically HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.,"The level of CD8+ CD38+ T lymphocytes in blood correlates with disease progression in HIV-infected individuals, independently of the CD4 count. Effective antiretroviral therapy reduces this lymphocyte subset in parallel with plasma viremia, although CD38 expression on CD8+ cells does not normalize completely in most subjects, and might reflect residual HIV replication. The expression of CD38 on CD8+ cells (as number of CD38 molecules per CD8+ cell) was measured quantitatively by flow cytometry in 200 individuals, of whom 170 were HIV positive and 30 were HIV-uninfected controls. Forty-six HIV-infected subjects were on antiretroviral therapy and had undetectable viral load. The remaining 124 HIV-positive persons were not on therapy and had detectable plasma viremia. The mean level of CD38 on CD8+ cells was higher in HIV-positive, untreated patients than in subjects on antiviral therapy and controls (5023, 2029, and 1978 molecules per CD8+ cell, respectively, p < 0.01). In HIV-positive, untreated subjects, the higher CD38 expression mainly occurred on CD45RO+ CD8+ cells. The level of CD38 strongly correlated with plasma HIV-RNA (r = 0.63, p < 0.001). The levels of CD38 on CD8+ cells declined steadily in HIV-positive subjects after beginning antiretroviral therapy. A few individuals presented viral blips whereas being on antiviral treatment, levels of CD38 on CD8+ cells increased transiently in parallel with episodes of viral replication. Levels of CD38 on CD8+ cells are increased in chronic HIV infection, and strongly correlate with plasma viremia. The slow decline of CD38 expression on CD8+ cells over time in subjects with undetectable plasma viremia while being on antiretroviral therapy suggests that CD38 expression on CD8+ cells could be used as a marker of residual virus replication."
Doc No.930,2118,negative/unlabeled,7.937068,Replication of chimeric human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) containing HIV-2 integrase (IN): naturally selected mutations in IN augment DNA synthesis.,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase (IN) protein augments the initiation of reverse transcription. Chimeric HIV-1 containing HIV-2 IN (SG3(IN2)) is severely impaired in virus infectivity and DNA synthesis. To analyze the nature of this defect, we infected T cells with the chimeric SG3(IN2) virus and by continuous passage in cell culture selected for virus with improved replication properties. Viruses from two different time points were chosen for further analysis, an early culture-adapted virus (CF-65) that exhibited an intermediate level of infectivity, and a later-passaged virus (CF-131) that was significantly more infectious. Sequence analysis of multiple clones derived from the CF-65 virus culture demonstrated a diversity of mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) and a common V204I IN mutation. Analysis of clones derived from the CF-131 virus indicated the selection of two additional IN mutations, Q96H and K127E, and a fixed V179I RT mutation. By cloning RT and/or IN sequences back into the original SG3(IN2) chimeric virus, we demonstrated that mutations in both RT and IN contributed to the improvement in viral fitness. The effect of the HIV-2IN(IN(2)) mutations on virus DNA synthesis was analyzed by packaging IN(2) mutants into HIV-1 as Vpr-IN(2) fusion proteins. This analysis revealed that the Q96H, K127E and V204I mutations increased the infectivity of the chimeric virus by augmenting the initiation of viral cDNA synthesis in infected cells. The Q96H and K127E mutations are present in adjacent helical structures on the surface of the IN protein and together account for most of the increase observed in DNA synthesis. Our findings provide evidence that the IN protein augments the initiation of reverse transcription through specific interactions with other viral components comprising the initiation complex. Moreover, they implicate specific regions on the surface of IN that may help to elucidate mechanisms by which the HIV-1 IN protein augments the initiation of HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo."
Doc No.931,1702,negative/unlabeled,7.9347315,Higher short-term virologic efficacy of three-class versus two-class highly active antiretroviral salvage therapy in HIV-infected patients.,"The efficacy of two-class versus three-class antiretroviral salvage treatment was analyzed retrospectively in 63 HIV-infected patients in whom highly active antiretroviral therapy failed. Twenty-eight patients (group A) received two-class therapy, and 35 patients (group B) received three-class therapy. After 3 months of treatment, a significantly greater proportion of patients in group B (23/35, 65.7%) than in group A (8/28, 28.5%) showed a > or = 1 log10 decrease in the plasma HIV RNA level (P = 0.0034). However, after 9-12 months, 12 of 23 (52.1%) group B responders showed viral load rebound. The results were partially explained by the finding that, at baseline, the great majority (21/27, 77.7%) of group A patients showed mutations conferring resistance to all drugs administered, whereas in group B patients' susceptibility to at least two drug classes was retained. However, after 9-12 months of therapy, most (18/20, 90%) of the short-term responders in group B showed emergence of additional mutations that hampered long-term response."
Doc No.932,4470,negative/unlabeled,7.932104,A recombinant Sendai virus is controlled by CD4+ effector T cells responding to a secreted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein.,"The importance of antigen-specific CD4(+) helper T cells in virus infections is well recognized, but their possible role as direct mediators of virus clearance is less well characterized. Here we describe a recombinant Sendai virus strategy for probing the effector role(s) of CD4(+) T cells. Mice were vaccinated with DNA and vaccinia virus recombinant vectors encoding a secreted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope protein and then challenged with a Sendai virus carrying a homologous HIV-1 envelope gene. The primed mice showed (i) prompt homing of numerous envelope-primed CD4(+) T cell populations to the virus-infected lung, (ii) substantial production of gamma interferon, and interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and IL-5 in that site, and (iii) significantly reduced pulmonary viral load. The challenge experiments were repeated with immunoglobulin(-/-) microMT mice in the presence or absence of CD8(+) and/or CD4(+) T cells. These selectively immunodeficient mice were protected by primed CD4(+) T cells in the absence of antibody or CD8(+) T cells. Together, these results highlight the role of CD4(+) T cells as direct effectors in vivo and, because this protocol gives such a potent response, identify an outstanding experimental model for further dissecting CD4(+) T-cell-mediated immunity in the lung."
Doc No.933,2526,negative/unlabeled,7.9216633,Defective hepatitis B virus DNA is not associated with disease status but is reduced by polymerase mutations associated with drug resistance.,"Defective hepatitis B virus DNA (dDNA) is reverse-transcribed from spliced hepatitis B virus (HBV) pregenomic messenger RNA (pgRNA) and has been identified in patients with chronic HBV (CH-B). The major 2.2-kb spliced pgRNA encodes a novel HBV gene product, the hepatitis B splice protein (HBSP) via a deletion and frame shift within the polymerase. Although spliced RNA and HBSP expression have been associated with increased HBV DNA levels and liver fibrosis, the role of dDNA in HBV-associated disease is largely undefined. Our aims were to (1) compare the relative proportions of dDNA (% dDNA) in a range of HBV-infected serum samples, including patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV coinfection and HBV-monoinfected persons with differing severities of liver disease, and (2) determine the effect of mutations associated with drug resistance on defective DNA production. Defective DNA was detected in 90% of persons with CH-B. There was no significant difference in the relative abundance of dDNA between the monoinfected and HIV/HBV-coinfected groups. We also found no association between the % dDNA and alanine aminotransferase, hepatitis B e antigen status, HBV DNA levels, fibrosis levels, compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis, genotype, or drug treatment. However, the % dDNA was significantly lower in individuals infected with lamivudine-resistant (LMV-R) HBV compared with wild-type HBV (P < 0.0001), indicating that antiviral drug resistance alters the balance between defective and genomic length DNA in circulation. Experiments in vitro using HBV encoding LMV-R mutations confirmed these results."

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and determine correlates of acquiring genotypic HIVDR among Vietnamese adults (age ≥ 18) who met the immunological or clinical criteria of first-line HAART failure according to the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO).
Doc No.936,9527,negative/unlabeled,7.915449,Identification of a replication-competent pathogenic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 with a duplication in the TCF-1alpha region but lacking NF-kappaB binding sites.,"Multiple human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sequences with deletions of NF-kappaB binding sites at both the 5' and 3' long terminal repeats (LTRs) were identified in serial samples collected from an infected individual. The effect of this deletion on the level of transcription was studied by transient transfection of an LTR-driven luciferase reporter gene and by infection with a full-length recombinant HIV-1 containing a luciferase reporter (HIVHXBluc). Detectable levels of gene expression were found in both systems, in the presence or absence of the viral transactivator Tat. Interestingly, a duplication of a putative TCF-1alpha motif was found in place of the NF-kappaB elements in these viruses. Higher transcriptional activity was observed with HXBLTR (NF-kappaB intact) than with the patient's LTR (NF-kappaB deleted), suggesting that the NF-kappaB binding sites may promote optimal levels of viral gene transcription. The ability of these viruses with NF-kappaB deleted to replicate and cause substantial decline in CD4 cell counts demonstrates that the NF-kappaB binding sites are not absolutely required for viral replication or pathogenicity in vivo. These results are consistent with the notion that the HIV-1 LTR possesses functional redundancy which allows it to interact with multiple transcription factors, thereby ensuring viral replication in a variety of cell types."
Doc No.937,8539,negative/unlabeled,7.9120145,Lamivudine therapy for hepatitis B infection.,"Several new antiviral agents have recently been developed which can inhibit hepatitis B replication by at least two logs. Lamivudine is the most widely studied of these new agents. Extensive phase II and III studies in patients with chronic hepatitis B are in progress, or have been completed. The sustained HBeAg seroconversion rate in patients who have received 100 mg lamivudine rate increase from 17% at year one to 27% after 2 years. Early treatment results have suggested that lamivudine improves hepatic histology in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and can prevent recurrence of hepatitis B after liver transplantation. It is likely that in the absence of immune clearance to accelerate elimination of infected hepatocytes, inhibitors of virus replication such as lamivudine will need to be administered for a long period to substantially reduce the burden of infected hepatocytes in the liver, and prevent relapse. Histological improvement has been noted in between 38% and 52% of lamivudine-treated patients, exceeding the improvement seen in placebo recipients. Lamivudine has also been assessed in anti-HBe positive, HBV DNA positive patients. Preliminary results show that 65% of lamivudine recipients become HBV DNA negative and have normal serum aminotransferases after a year of treatment. The drug is generally well tolerated with few direct adverse events. Genotypic mutations have been observed in 11% after 1 year of treatment, but this percentage doubles after 2 years of therapy. Loss of susceptibility lamivudine has been found to be due to reverse transcriptase amino acid substitutions. Lamivudine is likely to be reserved for patients with replicative hepatitis B infection with active chronic hepatitis, and/or active cirrhosis. Both HBeAg and anti-HBe positive patients are benefited, as may be patients with cirrhosis."
Doc No.938,301,positive/labeled,7.911413,Neighborhood community characteristics associated with HIV disease outcomes in a cohort of urban women living with HIV.,"Recent studies have found geographic variations in immune and viral human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease outcomes associated with census measures of neighborhood poverty and segregation. Although readily available, such aggregate census measures are not based on health behavior models and provide limited information regarding neighborhood effect pathways. In contrast, survey-based measures can capture specific aspects of neighborhood disadvantage that may better inform community-based interventions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the measurement validity of multi-dimensional survey measures of neighborhood disorder compared with census measures as predictors of HIV outcomes in a cohort of 197 low-income women in a major metropolitan area. The multi-dimensional survey measures were related to each other and to census measures of concentrated poverty and racial segregation, but not so highly correlated as to be uniform. We found notable variation between community areas in women's CD4 levels but there was no corresponding geographic variance in viral load, and relationships between community area measures and viral load disappeared after adjustment for individual characteristics, including HIV treatment adherence. In multilevel models adjusting for individual characteristics including substance use, depression, and HIV treatment adherence, one survey measure of neighborhood disadvantage (poor-quality built environment) and one census measure (racial segregation) were significantly associated with greater likelihood of CD4 < 500 (p < .05)."

In this study we analyzed the effect of circulating CD4+ CD25+ T cells on CD8+-T-cell responses of patients with chronic and resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We demonstrated that circulating CD4+ CD25+ T cells modulate the function and expansion of HBV-specific CD8+ cells ex vivo in all patients, regardless of whether they have chronic or resolved HBV infection. The possible role of CD4+ CD25+ T cells in the pathogenesis of chronic HBV infection is not supported by these data.

Some of the possible mechanisms underlying immune dysfunction include decreased HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, increased suppressor T cells, and/or increased HIV load. However, no study has been carried out to correlate all these factors. In this study, 26 patients showed > 3 log DNA copy number/10(6) CD4+ T cells, and seven patients had < 3 log DNA copy/10(6) CD4+ T cells. Patients with higher virus load had greater than 15% (19-45%) CD8+ CD11+ T cells. HIV-1 envelope-specific, HLA-restricted CTL activity (> 10%) was observed in 11 of 25 asymptomatic patients, and the remaining 14 patients lacked CTL activity (< 10%) in bulk assay. Although CTL activity was undetectable in these individuals, there was no significant difference in the frequency of activated CTL and their precursors in limiting dilution analysis. The patients with undetectable CTL activity had a higher percentage of CD8+ CD11+ T cells and a higher HIV-1 DNA copy number/million CD4+ T cells. Each of these parameters were significantly correlated with CD4+ T-cell numbers. The inverse relationship of CD8+ CD11+ T cells and virus load with HIV-specific CTL activity observed in this study may be one of the underlying factors which determines the course of HIV infection."

However, measurement of the CD4+ T-cell count is expensive and often unavailable in less developed areas. Previous studies have suggested that the total lymphocyte count (TLC) can be used to predict a low absolute CD4+ T-cell count. To determine the relationship between TLC and CD4+ T-cell count in HIV-1-infected South African patients, 2777 HIV-1-seropositive patients visiting the Immunology clinic at the Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein, South Africa from April 1991 to April 1997 were included in the study. In total, 3237 observations were used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, of various cutpoints of the TLC to predict an absolute CD4+ T-cell count of <200 cells/mm3, CD4+ percentage <20%, and CD4+ percentage <15%. Spearman rank correlations were calculated between TLC and CD4+ T cells, CD4+ percentage and CD8+ T cells, as well as between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Results demonstrated that a TLC of 2 x 10(9)/L or less had a sensitivity of 90.3% to detect patients with a CD4+ T-cell count of <200 cells/mm3, but a specificity of only 53.7%. When the TLC cutoff value was lowered, specificity increased but sensitivity decreased. For the observations as a group, a correlation (r = 0.704) between CD4+ T-cell count and TLC was demonstrated, but if the patients were divided into three groups according to their CD4+ T-cell count, this correlation weakened considerably. Therefore, although TLC shows a correlation with CD4+ T-cell count, it is not a good predictor of the CD4+ T-cell count in this population and should preferably not be used in the clinical care of HIV/AIDS patients."

This study addressed the effects of innate polymorphisms in HIV-2 on emergent resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. Emergent drug resistance profiles in HIV-2 subtypes A (n = 3) and B (n = 1) were compared to those of HIV-1 subtypes B and C. Drug resistance was evaluated with cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and MT2 cells, using selective pressure with tenofovir (TFV), zidovudine (ZDV), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), abacavir (ABC), lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine (FTC), or various dual-drug combinations. Resistance was evaluated using conventional and ultrasensitive sequencing approaches. In agreement with our previous findings, dual-drug combinations of TFV, ddI, ABC, d4T, ZDV, and 3TC preferentially selected for K65R in HIV-1 subtype C isolates. In HIV-1 subtype B, TFV-3TC and ZDV-3TC selected for M184I and D67N, respectively. In contrast, selections with all four HIV-2 cultures favored the development of M184I in dual-drug combinations that included either 3TC or FTC. Since HIV-2 cultures did not develop K65R, an ultrasensitive allele-specific real-time PCR assay was developed to distinguish the presence of 65R from wild-type K65 after 16 cycles with a discriminatory ability of 0.1% against a population of wild-type virus. These results underscore potential differences in emergent drug resistance pathways in HIV-1 and HIV-2 and show that polymorphisms may influence the development of the resistance pathways that are likely to emerge."

In-depth phylogenetic analyses of viral sequences obtained in the screening phase from antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients seeking enrollment in EPZ108859, a large open-label study in the USA, Canada and Puerto Rico (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00440947) were examined for insights into the roles of drug resistance and epidemiological factors that could impact disease dissemination. Viral transmission clusters (VTCs) were initially predicted from a phylogenetic analysis of population level HIV-1 pol sequences obtained from 690 antiretroviral-naïve subjects in 2007. Subsequently, the predicted VTCs were tested for robustness by ultra deep sequencing (UDS) using pyrosequencing technology and further phylogenetic analyses. The demographic characteristics of clustered and non-clustered subjects were then compared. From 690 subjects, 69 were assigned to 1 of 30 VTCs, each containing 2 to 5 subjects. Race composition of VTCs were significantly more likely to be white (72% vs. 60%; p = 0.04). VTCs had fewer reverse transcriptase and major PI resistance mutations (9% vs. 24%; p = 0.002) than non-clustered sequences. Both men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) (68% vs. 48%; p = 0.001) and Canadians (29% vs. 14%; p = 0.03) were significantly more frequent in VTCs than non-clustered sequences. Of the 515 subjects who initiated antiretroviral therapy, 33 experienced confirmed virologic failure through 144 weeks while only 3/33 were from VTCs. Fewer VTCs subjects (as compared to those with non-clustering virus) had HIV-1 with resistance-associated mutations or experienced virologic failure during the course of the study. Our analysis shows specific geographical and drug resistance trends that correlate well with transmission clusters defined by HIV sequences of similarity. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the utility of molecular and epidemiological analysis of VTCs for identifying population-specific risks associated with HIV-1 transmission and developing effective local healthcare strategies.

The 12 patients with persistent viraemia were all lamivudine (LAM) experienced and 7 had a polymerase sequencing test available. LAM substitution mutations L180M + M204V/I were found in six out of seven cases, with an accompanying V173L mutation in three cases. These mutations were also related with changes in HBsAg. The use of potent drugs in the first line anti-HBV therapy may reduce the resistance mutations in the future."
Doc No.947,2207,negative/unlabeled,7.891503,Management of dyslipidaemia in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.,"Dyslipidaemia associated with the treatment of HIV infection, particularly with the use of protease inhibitors (PIs), can raise cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels to the thresholds indicated for intervention. Recent evidence from epidemiological studies has shown that there are correlations between antiretroviral drug use and increased risks for, and incidences of, cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease. The primary goals of dyslipidaemia therapy for HIV patients are reductions of both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and markedly elevated TG levels. Dietary strategies and exercise programs may be tried, although these have shown inconsistent results. The two options for drug therapy are switching antiretroviral agents and using lipid-lowering drugs. Each approach is associated with advantages and limitations, and the need to maintain viral suppression must be balanced with the need to treat abnormal lipid levels. Most drug switches replace the PI component with drugs from another antiretroviral class. Selection of drug therapy for lipid lowering depends on the type of dyslipidaemia predominating and the potential for drug interactions. The use of the statins pravastatin and atorvastatin is recommended for the treatment of patients with elevated LDL-C levels and gemfibrozil or fenofibrate for patients with elevated TG concentrations. Development of new PIs with more favourable effects on the lipid profile should be of benefit."

Due to the presence of unmethylated CpG sequences, DNA vaccination can boost the innate immunity driving more potent T cell-mediated immune responses. Therefore, cynomolgus monkeys were vaccinated with a tat-expressing vector containing defined unmethylated CpG sequences (pCV-tat). Here it is shown that the intramuscular inoculation of the pCV-tat contained primary infection with the highly pathogenic SHIV89.6P virus preventing the CD4(+) T cell decline in all the vaccinated monkeys. Undetectable virus replication and negative virus isolation correlated in all cases with the presence of anti-Tat CTLs. However, a CD8-mediated non cytolytic antiviral activity was also present in all protected animals. Of note, this activity was absent in the controls but was present in the monkey inoculated with the CpG-rich vector alone that was partially protected against viral challenge (i.e. no virus replication but positive virus isolation). These results suggest that a CTL response against Tat protects against primary infection by blocking virus replication at its early stage, in the absence of sterilizing immunity. Nevertheless, the boost of the innate immunity by CpG sequences can contribute to this protection both by driving more potent CTL responses and by inducing other CD8-mediated antiviral activities. Thus, the CpG-rich tat DNA vaccine may represent a promising candidate for preventive and therapeutic vaccination against AIDS."

Comparisons were made between hospitals that are designated by the New York State Department of Health as comprehensive treatment centers--designated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) centers--and all other hospitals. For patients who had been on PCP prophylaxis before admission, 34% had documentation of positive histologic evidence for PCP infection during the studied hospitalization period. Of all patients not on PCP prophylaxis at the time of admission, 94% had at least one of the diagnostic tests for PCP done during the PCP hospitalization. Eighty-one percent of all patients had either pulse oximetry or an arterial blood gas determination. Seventy-seven percent of all patients with a PO2 equal to or less than 70 mm Hg received steroids. All eligible patients received one of nine possible treatment combinations, which included either single drug therapy, multiple drug therapy, or participation in a clinical trial. Sixteen percent of eligible patients had no documentation of receiving PCP medication at discharge. Proportions receiving diagnostic or treatment interventions were usually higher in designated AIDS centers than in non-designated AIDS centers."

Just over 10 per cent of clients (n = 83) reported ever having injected drugs. This group was matched according to age, gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation with an equal sized control group drawn from clients who had not injected drugs. The groups were compared in terms of their sexual practices, sexual partnerships, other drug use, current and past health status and their perception of HIV risk. The injecting drug users reported more sex partners than the nonusers, they were less likely to be in a relationship and they were less likely to be monogamous. Vaginal and oral sex were the most common practices in both groups but anal sex was more common among users than the nonusers. Regular condom use was reported by less than a quarter of each group. The health status of drug users was generally poorer than that of the nonusers. They reported greater use of alcohol and other drugs, more mental health problems, and more symptoms of ill health. They also had experienced more sexually-transmitted diseases. Only 1 per cent of users and 2 per cent of nonusers tested positively for HIV, although users saw themselves and their partners as at greater risk of HIV infection than the nonusers."
Doc No.951,8269,positive/labeled,7.890085,Assessing subtype and drug-resistance-associated mutations among antiretroviral-treated HIV-infected patients.,Several studies have reported an increasing number of therapeutic failures with antiretroviral drugs in HIV-infected patients.

The aim of this study is to determine viral subtypes and drug-resistance mutations among antiretroviral-treated HIV-infected patients.
Doc No.952,5726,negative/unlabeled,7.888198,Treatment-mediated alterations in HIV fitness preserve CD4+ T cell counts but have minimal effects on viral load.,"For most HIV-infected patients, antiretroviral therapy controls viral replication. However, in some patients drug resistance can cause therapy to fail. Nonetheless, continued therapy with a failing regimen can preserve or even lead to increases in CD4+ T cell counts. To understand the biological basis of these observations, we used mathematical models to explain observations made in patients with drug-resistant HIV treated with enfuvirtide (ENF/T-20), an HIV-1 fusion inhibitor. Due to resistance emergence, ENF was removed from the drug regimen, drug-sensitive virus regrown, and ENF was re-administered. We used our model to study the dynamics of plasma-viral RNA and CD4+ T cell levels, and the competition between drug-sensitive and resistant viruses during therapy interruption and re-administration. Focusing on resistant viruses carrying the V38A mutation in gp41, we found ENF-resistant virus to be 17±3% less fit than ENF-sensitive virus in the absence of the drug, and that the loss of resistant virus during therapy interruption was primarily due to this fitness cost. Using viral dynamic parameters estimated from these patients, we show that although re-administration of ENF cannot suppress viral load, it can, in the presence of resistant virus, increase CD4+ T cell counts, which should yield clinical benefits. This study provides a framework to investigate HIV and T cell dynamics in patients who develop drug resistance to other antiretroviral agents and may help to develop more effective strategies for treatment."
Doc No.953,4106,negative/unlabeled,7.8833895,Induction of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) gene expression by human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat in human astrocytes is CDK9 dependent.,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) invades the brain early in infection and may cause HIV-associated dementia (HAD), which is characterized by reactive astrocytes, and macrophage and T-cell infiltrates. HIV-1 Tat protein is thought to contribute to HAD by transactivating host genes, such as that encoding monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), although its mechanisms of action are not fully understood. We investigated the molecular pathways involved in Tat-induced MCP-1/CCL2 gene expression in human astrocytes. We found that Tat induced MCP-1/CCL2 synthesis in human astrocytes infected with a lentivirus carrying the gene encoding Tat or treated with a biologically active synthetic Tat protein. The induction of MCP-1/CCL2 was independent of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) classical pathway, but was significantly inhibited by specific cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (cdk9) inhibitors, such as a dominant-negative mutant or siRNA. By contrast, broader-spectrum cdk inhibitors, such as roscovitine, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), and flavopiridol, inhibited MCP-1/CCL2 induction by Tat. We also analyzed the effects of roscovitine, DRB, and flavopiridol on Tat-induced HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) expression following the infection of astrocytes and HeLa cells. Astrocytes showed no inhibition by roscovitine, 59% inhibition by DRB, and 80% inhibition by flavopiridol. In control HeLa cells, high levels of inhibition were observed with roscovitine, DRB, and flavopiridol. We have ascertained the direct implication of cdk9 in Tat-induced MCP-1 expression by performing ChIP assay. These results demonstrate that cdk9 is involved in Tat-induced HIV-1 LTR, MCP-1/CCL2 gene expression."

In sub-Saharan Africa, MDR/XDR tuberculosis with HIV coinfection is common, and concurrent treatment of HIV infection and MDR/XDR tuberculosis is required. Out of necessity, patients receive multiple drugs, and PAS therapy is frequent; however, neither potential drug interactions nor the effects of HIV infection are known. Potential drug-drug interaction with PAS and the effect of HIV infection was examined in 73 pulmonary tuberculosis patients; 22 (30.1%) were HIV coinfected. Forty-one pulmonary MDR or XDR tuberculosis patients received 4 g PAS twice daily, and in a second crossover study, another 32 patients were randomized, receiving 4 g PAS twice daily or 8 g PAS once daily. A PAS population pharmacokinetic model in two dosing regimens was developed; potential covariates affecting its pharmacokinetics were examined, and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted evaluating the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic index. The probability of target attainment (PTA) to maintain PAS levels above MIC during the dosing interval was estimated by simulation of once-, twice-, and thrice-daily dosing regimens not exceeding 12 g daily. Concurrent efavirenz (EFV) medication resulted in a 52% increase in PAS clearance and a corresponding >30% reduction in mean PAS area under the concentration curve in 19 of 22 HIV-M. tuberculosis-coinfected patients. Current practice recommends maintenance of PAS concentrations at ≥1 μg/ml (the MIC of M. tuberculosis), but the model predicts that at only a minimum dose of 4 g twice daily can this PTA be achieved in at least 90% of the population, whether or not EFV is concomitantly administered. Once-daily dosing of 12 g PAS will not provide PAS concentrations exceeding the MIC over the entire dosing interval if coadministered with EFV, while 4 g twice daily ensures concentrations exceeding MIC over the entire dosing interval, even in HIV-infected patients who received EFV.

Doc No.955,2588,negative/unlabeled,7.8787847,In vitro human immunodeficiency virus type 1 resistance selections with combinations of tenofovir and emtricitabine or abacavir and lamivudine.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resistance development was evaluated in vitro by using combinations of the drugs tenofovir and emtricitabine or abacavir and lamivudine, as well as by using the compounds individually. Emtricitabine- and lamivudine-resistant HIV-1 isolates with the M184I or M184V mutation in reverse transcriptase were readily selected in the cultures with emtricitabine alone, lamivudine alone, and the two drug combinations and conferred high-level resistance to emtricitabine and lamivudine. Tenofovir-resistant HIV-1 isolates with the K65R mutation occurred in both the culture with tenofovir alone and the culture with the combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir. The S68N and S68K mutations were also observed in the tenofovir cultures, with no detectable impact on resistance, suggesting a possible compensatory role in viral fitness. At low concentrations of emtricitabine and tenofovir, the M184I mutation appeared first, followed by the K65R mutation, in a subset of viruses. At intermediate concentrations of emtricitabine and tenofovir, viruses harboring the K65R mutation or a novel K65N and K70R double mutation grew before they gave rise to mutants with K65R and M184V/I double mutations at higher emtricitabine concentrations. Abacavir resistance was characterized by the accumulation of the M184V, Y115F, and K65R mutations in the abacavir culture, while the M184V and L74V mutations were selected in combination with lamivudine. In the presence of the abacavir resistance mutations, viral growth was strong even in the presence of high concentrations of abacavir. In contrast, viral growth was markedly impaired in the cultures with high tenofovir concentrations, even in the presence of K65R. In conclusion, these studies show that HIV-1 mutants with a K65R and M184V genotype are generated under maximum selection pressure from the combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine."

These mutations alter the structure of viral target proteins and reduce or in the worst case completely inhibit the effect of antiretroviral compounds while maintaining the ability for effective replication. Modern anti-HIV-1 regimens comprise multiple drugs in order to prevent or at least delay the development of resistance mutations. However, commonly used HIV-1 genotype interpretation systems provide only classifications for single drugs. The EuResist initiative has collected data from about 18,500 patients to train three classifiers for predicting response to combination antiretroviral therapy, given the viral genotype and further information. In this work we compare different classifier fusion methods for combining the individual classifiers."
Doc No.957,4658,negative/unlabeled,7.8751154,Structured treatment interruptions for the management of HIV infection.,"Antiretroviral drugs constitute a milestone in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; however, emerging problems limit their long-term use, and an increasing number of patients interrupt the prescribed continuous drug therapy for short or long periods. Some patients appear to benefit from structured treatment interruptions (STI), involving monitored repetition of on-and-off cycles of drugs; however, it is unclear whether patients and/or physicians should consider STI as a treatment option. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive update on the use of STI in clinical settings, and to carefully evaluate the advantages and potential risks for patients infected with HIV. We used a MEDLINE search to find all English-language articles published January 1999 to August 2001 regarding patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy for whom treatment interruption was investigated. Priority was assigned to peer-reviewed sources, when available. Otherwise, abstracts from authoritative international conferences were selected through the AIDSLINE database. Results from various studies with respect to type of drug treatment, baseline patient status, number of treatment interruptions, duration of treatment and interruption, changes in viral load, and immune system parameters were analyzed. Patients could be categorized into 3 distinct clinical scenarios: acute infection, chronic drug-suppressed infection and virological drug failure. The STI approach may offer more benefit during acute infection when the patient's immune system remains nearly intact. It is yet to be determined whether STI will facilitate the long-term management of chronic infection by decreasing drug-associated toxicity and improving quality of life without jeopardizing the efficacy of the treatment. Results from randomized controlled trials and more definitive means of gauging the status of the patient's immune system must be available before this treatment method is extended beyond the research setting. Ultimately, a safer approach using therapeutic immunization or vaccination would be preferable for stimulating vigorous T-cell-mediated immune responses and control of HIV during treatment interruption."

Sixteen LLR patients, 18 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected controls (hereafter, ""HIV controls""), and 16 healthy subjects were included. The frequency of CD4(+)CD25(hi)FoxP3(+) and HIV-specific Treg suppressive function were assessed. Relationships between Treg and CD4/CD8 activation (HLA-DR/CD38) and the frequency of naive CD4 T-cells were assessed. Low-level patients showed a higher Treg frequency but reduced HIV-specific immunosuppressive functions than HIV controls. Whereas in healthy subjects a strong negative correlation between Tregs and activated CD8 T cells emerged (r = -0.75, P < .001), it appeared disrupted in both HIV-infected groups (r = -0.06 and P = .83 for LLR patients; r = -0.11 and P = .68 for and HIV controls). Nevertheless, in LLR patients, Tregs negatively correlated with naive CD4 T cells (r = -0.60, P = .01), whereas there was no such correlation in HIV controls (r = -0.19, P = .46) or healthy subjects (r = -0.10, P = .73). Remarkably, a higher ratio of Tregs to naive CD4 T cells was observed in LLR patients than in HIV controls (P = .001) and healthy subjects (P < .001). We conclude that LLR patients have important alterations in immunoregulation involving CD4(+)CD25(hi)FoxP3(+) Tregs. In this scenario, the role of Tregs seems to be more related to the control of the naive CD4 T-cell homeostatic proliferation, rather than to the immune activation."

Twenty-four patients received five sequential daily doses of 50 or 100 mg of HE2000 or placebo every 6 weeks for up to three courses, and were followed thereafter for 3 months. HE2000 was safe, with transient injection site reactions being the main side-effect. Peripheral blood samples, collected serially, were analysed for changes in immune cell phenotypes. Significant increases were observed in the numbers of circulating dendritic cells, early activated (CD69+ CD25-) CD8 T-cells and T-NK cells after administration of 50-mg doses of HE2000 (p < 0.05). Gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was analysed by real-time RT-PCR. Before treatment, HIV-1-infected patients had significantly elevated transcripts for a number of inflammatory mediators (p < 0.012). After 50 mg or 100 mg HE2000, but not after placebo, there were significant sustained decreases in IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and Cox-2 transcripts (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in CD4 cell numbers, although patients receiving 50-mg doses demonstrated a significant decrease in viral load (- 0.6 log; p < 0.01). Anti-HIV-1 T-cell responses were analysed serially using GAG-peptides to stimulate cytoplasmic IFN-gamma responses. After three courses, the 50-mg dose group demonstrated a significant increase in CD8 T-cell response against two distinct GAG peptide pools (p < 0.03). These findings suggest that immune-based therapies may be able to impact viral load by decreasing inflammation and/or stimulating CD8 T-cells."

In this study using flow cytometry, we have investigated the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta repertoire of peripheral blood T lymphocytes in 8 HAM/TSP patients, 10 HTLV-1 infected healthy carriers, and 11 uninfected healthy controls to determine if there is a biased usage of TCR Vbeta. We found that TCR Vbeta7.2 was under-utilized and Vbeta12 was over-utilized in CD4+ T cells of HTLV-1 infected individuals compared with healthy uninfected controls, whereas there were no such differences in CD8+ T cells. Comparison of Vbeta repertoire changes before and after interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment for HAM/TSP revealed that one out of five patients showed dramatic decrease of specific Vbeta in CD8+ T cells. Our results suggest that dominant Vbeta subpopulations in CD4+ T cells evolved associated with chronic HTLV-1 infection, and IFN-alpha treatment for HAM/TSP does not induce a specific pattern of TCR Vbeta changes."

We measured the PD-1 expression levels on HBV-specific CD8 T cells and investigated the role of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in T-cell responses of patients with different HBV infection statuses. Compared to the patients with convalescent acute hepatitis B, PD-1 expression on total CD8 T cells from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients was significantly upregulated, especially on the HBV pentamer-positive CD8 T cells. And PD-L1, but not PD-L2, was also significantly upregulated on PBMC from CHB patients. In CHB patients, HBV-specific T cells and cellular proliferation could be observed under the recombinant HBV-Ag stimulation in vitro, and blockade of PD-1 pathway significantly enhanced the IFN-gamma production and cellular proliferation of PBMC. Furthermore, PD-1 expression level on HBV-pentamers positive CD8 T cells was positively associated with plasma viral load in CHB patients. Thus, PD-1 upregulation on HBV-specific CD8 T cells is engaged in the dysfunction of T cells and high viraemia in CHB patients, and the antiviral T-cell responses could be improved by the blockade of this inhibitory PD-1/PD-L1 pathway."

This protective role is linked to single immunodominant HLA-B27-restricted CD8+ T-cell epitopes in both infections. In order to define the relative contribution of a specific HLA-B27-restricted epitope to the natural course of HCV infection, we compared the biological impact of the highly conserved HCV genotype 1 epitope, for which the protective role has been described, with the corresponding region in genotype 3 that differs in its sequence by three amino acid residues. The genotype 3a peptide was not recognized by CD8+ T cells specific for the genotype 1 peptide. Furthermore, patients with acute or chronic infection with HCV genotype 3a did not mount T-cell responses to this epitope region, and their autologous viral sequences showed no evidence of T-cell pressure. Finally, we found a significantly higher frequency of HLA-B27 positivity in patients with chronic HCV genotype 3a infection compared to genotype 1 infection, indicating that there is no protection by HLA-B27 in HCV genotype 3 infection."

Among HIV-1 gene products, the envelope (Env) protein contains variable as well as conserved regions. In this report, an informatic approach to the design of T-cell vaccines directed to HIV-1 Env M group global sequences was tested. Synthetic Env antigens were designed to express mosaics that maximize the inclusion of common potential T-cell epitope (PTE) 9-mers and minimize the inclusion of rare epitopes likely to elicit strain-specific responses. DNA vaccines were evaluated using intracellular cytokine staining in inbred mice with a standardized panel of highly conserved 15-mer PTE peptides. One-, two-, and three-mosaic sets that increased theoretical epitope coverage were developed. The breadth and magnitude of T-cell immunity stimulated by these vaccines were compared to those for natural strain Envs; additional comparisons were performed on mutant Envs, including gp160 or gp145 with or without V regions and gp41 deletions. Among them, the two- or three-mosaic Env sets elicited the optimal CD4 and CD8 responses. These responses were most evident in CD8 T cells; the three-mosaic set elicited responses to an average of eight peptide pools, compared to two pools for a set of three natural Envs. Synthetic mosaic HIV-1 antigens can therefore induce T-cell responses with expanded breadth and may facilitate the development of effective T-cell-based HIV-1 vaccines."
Doc No.968,7203,negative/unlabeled,7.8430066,The role of needle exchange programs in HIV prevention.,"Injecting drug users (IDUs) are at high risk for infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne pathogens. In the United States, IDUs account for nearly one-third of the cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), either directly or indirectly (heterosexual and perinatal cases of AIDS where the source of infection was an IDU). IDU also account for a substantial proportion of cases of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus infections. The primary mode of transmission of HIV among IDUs is parenteral, through direct needle sharing or multiperson use of syringes. Despite high levels of knowledge about risk, multiperson use of needles and syringes is due primarily to fear of arrest and incarceration for violation of drug paraphernalia laws and ordinances that prohibit manufacture, sale, distribution, or possession of equipment and materials intended to be used with narcotics. It is estimated that in 1997 there were approximately 110 needle exchange programs (NEPs) in North America. In part, because of the ban on the use of Federal funds for the operation of needle exchange, it has been difficult to evaluate the efficacy of these programs. This chapter presents data from the studies that have evaluated the role of NEPs in HIV prevention. Evidence for the efficacy of NEPs comes from three source: (1) studies originally focused on the effectiveness of NEPs in non-HIV blood-borne infections, (2) mathematical modeling of data on needle exchange on HIV seroincidence, and (3) studies that examine the positive and negative impact of NEPs on HIV and AIDS. Case-control studies have provided powerful data on the positive effect of NEPs on reduction of two blood-borne viral infections (HBV and HCV) For example, a case-control study in Tacoma, Washington, showed that a six-fold increase in HBV and a seven-fold increase in HCV infections in IDUs were associated with nonuse of the NEP. The first federally funded study of needle exchange was an evaluation of the New Haven NEP, which is legally operated by the New Haven Health Department. Rather than relying on self-report of reduced risky injection drug use, this study utilized mathematical and statistical modeling, using data from a syringe tracking and testing system. Incidence of HIV infection among needle exchange participants was estimated to have decreased by 33% as a result of the NEP. A series of Government-commissioned reports have reviewed the data on positive and negative outcomes of NEPs. The major reports are from the National Commission on AIDS; the U.S. General Accounting Office; the Centers for Disease Control/University of California; and the National Academy of Sciences. The latter two reports are used in this chapter. The aggregated results support the positive benefit of NEPs and do not support negative outcomes from NEPs. When legal restrictions on both purchase and possession of syringes are removed, IDUs will change their syringe-sharing behaviors in ways that can reduce HIV transmission. NEPs do not result in increased drug use among participants or the recruitment of first-time drug users."

At baseline, 62 % reported previously visiting an HIV clinic, 45 % reported taking cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, and 31 % were ""care-naïve"" (no previous clinic visit and not on cotrimoxazole). After 1 year, intervention participants were more likely to report being in care (92 vs 84 %; PRR 1.09, p = 0.039), on cotrimoxazole (89 vs 81 %; PRR 1.10, p = 0.047), and safe water vessel adherence (23 vs 14 %; PRR 1.64, p = 0.024). The effect was observed only among care-naïve participants (n = 139) with 83 % intervention versus 56 % controls reporting being in HIV care (PRR 1.47, p = 0.006), 78 versus 58 % on cotrimoxazole (PRR 1.35, p = 0.04), and 20 versus 4 % safe water vessel adherence (PRR 5.78, p = 0.017). Peer support may be an effective intervention to facilitate pre-ART care compliance in this important population. "
Doc No.970,7940,negative/unlabeled,7.8358626,Infectious properties of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 mutants with distinct affinities for the CD4 receptor.,"Recent evidence suggests that primary patient isolates of T-cell-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1 ) have lower affinities for CD4 than their laboratory-adapted derivatives, that this may partly result from tighter gp120-gp41 bonds that constrain the CD4 binding sites of the primary viruses, and that selection for increased CD4 affinity may be the principal factor in laboratory adaptation of HIV-1 (S. L. Kozak, E. J. Platt, N. Madani, F. E. Ferro, Jr., K. Peden, and D. Kabat, J. Virol. 71:873-882, 1997). These conclusions were based on studies with a panel of HeLa-CD4 cell clones that differ in CD4 levels over a broad range, with laboratory-adapted viruses infecting all clones with equal efficiencies and primary T-cell-tropic viruses infecting the clones in proportion to cellular CD4 levels. Additionally, all of the primary and laboratory-adapted T-cell-tropic viruses efficiently used CXCR-4 (fusin) as a coreceptor. To test these conclusions by an independent approach, we studied mutations in the laboratory-adapted virus LAV/IIIB that alter the CD)4 binding region of gp120 and specifically reduce CD4 affinities of free gp 120 by 85 to 98% (U. Olshevsky et al., J. Virol. 64:5701-5707, 1990). These mutations reduced virus titers to widely varying extents that ranged from severalfold to several orders of magnitude and converted infectivities on the HeLa-CD4 panel from CD4 independency to a high degree of CD4 dependency that resembled the behavior of primary patient viruses. The relative infectivities of the mutants correlated closely with their sensitivities to inactivation by soluble CD4 but did not correlate with the relative CD4 affinities of their free gp120s. Most of the mutations did not substantially alter envelope glycoprotein synthesis, processing, expression on cell surfaces, incorporation into virions, or rates of gp120 shedding from virions. However, one mutation (D457R) caused a decrease in gp160 processing by approximately 80%. The fact that several mutations increased rates of spontaneous viral inactivation (especially D368P) suggests that HIV-1 life spans may be determined by structural stabilities of viral envelope glycoproteins. All of the wild-type and mutant viruses were only slowly and inefficiently adsorbed onto cultured CD4-positive cells at 37 degrees C, and the gradual declines in viral titers in the media were caused almost exclusively by spontaneous inactivation rather than by adsorption. The extreme inefficiency with which infectious HIV-1 is able to infect cultured susceptible CD4-positive cells in standard assay conditions casts doubt on previous inferences that the vast majority of retrovirions produced in cultures are noninfectious. Apparent infectivity of T-cell-tropic HIV-1 in culture is limited by productive associations with CD4 and is influenced in an interdependent manner by CD4 affinities of viral gp120-gp41 complexes and quantities of cell surface CD4."

In phase 1, cocultivated culture supernatants obtained from 10 HIV-1 cultures were transported to three Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) Virology Laboratories. Three commercial HIV-p24 antigen capture (AC) tests and two reverse transcriptase (RT) assays were used to ascertain the replication of HIV-1. The Du Pont and Abbott AC assays were found to be most sensitive (85-100%), and the RT assay with 24-h incubation period had comparable sensitivity (75-100%). In phase II, the sensitivity of standard cocultivation procedure for HIV-1 isolation was compared using freshly phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P)-stimulated, stimulated-frozen, and frozen-thawed and then stimulated normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as cocultivating cells. Blood samples from 13 HIV-1 infected individuals with various CD4+ cell counts were cocultivated in each of the three MACS laboratories using one of the aforementioned normal PBMCs. The PHA-P-stimulated fresh normal PBMC showed a maximum isolation rate of 100% (13 of 13) with an average of 8 days to positivity. This rate of isolation was significantly greater than other rates using any one of the other PBMC preparations. These findings demonstrated that the use of freshly PHA-P stimulated PBMCs maximized HIV-1 isolation from blood when a sensitive HIV-1 p24 AC assay or RT assay with overnight incubation is employed for the detection of HIV in culture supernatant."

Doc No.973,176,negative/unlabeled,7.823223,Genotypic resistance tests for the clinical management of patients with primary HIV infection.,"Witness for the prosecution: Assays to detect antiretroviral drug resistance have recently become available, but several factors limit the clinical utility of resistance testing in patients with primary HIV infection (PHI). First, there is a great uncertainty in the prevalence of PHI due to resistant virus, which may vary from 2% to over 50%. Moreover, studies on temporal trends give discordant results. Secondly, the reported degree of resistance is also variable since low levels of resistance are reported in some cases. The clinical significance of such low-level baseline reduced susceptibility to some antiretrovirals is uncertain. Thirdly, current resistance testing might not detect minority populations of drug-resistant species. Reversion of mutations conferring drug resistance was described in patients who acquired drug-resistant strains, and viral strains harbouring drug-resistant mutations may become minor species in untreated patients owing to the absence of drug pressure. Finally, no prospective clinical trials have been conducted to test the clinical or virological utility of resistance testing in PHI. Witness for the defence: A suboptimal initial regimen in subjects infected with drug-resistant virus may be associated with multiple treatment failures in the early stage of the disease and hence with a more rapid disease progression. When treating PHI, immediate, complete and long-lasting suppression of virus replication is desired both to limit total body viral burden and to preserve HIV-1 specific immune responses. Transmission of resistant virus has been identified for each therapeutic class. A greater than 2.5-fold resistance to one or more antiretroviral agent has been observed in 26% of patients with PHI and resistance among newly infected patients has increased over the past 3 y. Treatment should not be delayed to wait for the result of the test. However, once a resistant virus has been identified, one or more drugs can be readily substituted. Prospective randomized studies to address the need for baseline resistance testing in the setting of PHI are warranted."

There was considerable overlap and transitioning between crack smoking and injecting. Crack users were also significantly more likely to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual than other drug users. In multivariate analysis, HIV infection was independently associated with crack use and with being gay or bisexual. In New York City, HIV prevention for drug users has focused on syringe access, safe injection, and drug user treatment, but further progress in HIV control will require strategies to address sexual health among people who use drugs. The study's limitations are noted."

In this scenario, the advent of single-tablet, once-daily, fixed-dose co-formulations is important for reducing pill burden and maximize long-term drug adherence. Cobicistat-boosted darunavir along with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide co-formulation (DRV/c/FTC/TAF or the trade name Symtuza®) is the first marketed protease inhibitor-based fixed-dose combination regimen for the treatment of HIV infection. It was approved in late 2017 by the European Medical Agency both for naïve patients and treatment-experienced patients with viral suppression. Areas covered: PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov and presentations at scientific meetings were searched with the terms 'darunavir/cobicistat' and 'tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine' for clinical trials either conducted to date or ongoing as well as a review of abstracts from major HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases conferences from 2015 to up to date. Expert opinion: DRV/c/FTC/TAF is a novel unique antiretroviral drug co-formulation that exhibits a convenient dosing, satisfactory safety profile, and high antiviral efficacy, even in patients harboring viruses with resistance to antivirals other than darunavir in the short-midterm. It represents the first fixed-dose combination therapy including a protease inhibitor given as one single pill once daily for drug-naïve patients and as second-line antiretroviral therapy."

Moreover, it remains to be demonstrated whether residual viremia consists of viruses capable of spreading infection in vivo upon termination of therapy. Using residual viral RNAs (vRNAs) isolated from a HAART-treated patient's plasma, we cloned full-length viral genomes and found that most of them could produce infectious, replication-competent HIVs when transfected into TZM-bl cells, suggesting that residual viruses produced in the absence of therapy can initiate fresh cycles of infection and spread in host cells. The data further indicate that residual viremia may pose a major concern with regard to the emergence of drug-resistant HIVs during periods of low adherence to therapy."
Doc No.977,8201,negative/unlabeled,7.808992,Expression of CD69 after in vitro stimulation: a rapid method for quantitating impaired lymphocyte responses in HIV-infected individuals.,"A flow cytometric assay based on expression of the activation antigen CD69 was developed to analyze immunological responses of T cells from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (HIV+) or HIV-seronegative (HIV-) donors after in vitro simulation by antigens and polyclonal activators. The levels of CD69 on freshly-isolated or unstimulated, cultured CD3+, CD4+, or CD8+ peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) subsets were low and did not differ greatly between HIV+ and HIV- donors. The frequencies of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ lymphocytes from HIV+ donors that expressed CD69 after culture with antigenic or mitogenic stimuli were significantly lower than in HIV- donors. Comparison of CD69 expression with [3H]thymidine incorporation revealed that both assays could detect lymphocyte responses to antigenic or mitogenic stimuli. The CD3+ PBL from HIV+ or HIV- donors did not show increased CD69 expression after culture with soluble or cross-linked recombinant envelope glycoprotein, gp120. The gp120, however, significantly inhibited CD69 expression in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cells in vitro and may also affect T-cell activation in vivo. These studies demonstrate the usefulness of this CD69 expression assay for the rapid assessment of defects in immune responses of phenotypically defined lymphocyte subsets in HIV+ patients and for testing the effects of agents that modulate immune activation."
Doc No.978,2925,negative/unlabeled,7.8084335,Longitudinal study of leukocyte functions in homosexual men seroconverted for HIV: rapid and persistent loss of B cell function after HIV infection.,"The early effects of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were investigated in homosexual men who had seroconverted for anti-HIV antibodies. Leukocyte functional activities were determined in longitudinally collected peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples. During the first 10 months following seroconversion, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody-induced T cell proliferation, monocyte accessory function and T helper activity on B cell differentiation in a pokeweed mitogen-driven system were not affected. In contrast, from the moment of seroconversion on, B cells of seroconverted men failed to produce immunoglobulin in the pokeweed mitogen-driven system. This defect was not restored by addition of normal CD4+ T cells. Immunoglobulin synthesis induced by Staphylococcus aureus and interleukin 2 decreased gradually, until it was completely lost 10 months after seroconversion. In addition, proliferation in response to anti-IgM or Staphylococcus aureus by B cells from HIV seroconverted men was decreased. The lack of inducible in vitro B cell activity was not accompanied by elevated spontaneous Ig synthesis by B cells of the seroconverted men. In the second group of men studied during the 2nd year following seroconversion, T helper activity on normal B cell differentiation significantly decreased, whereas anti-CD3-induced T cell proliferation and monocyte accessory function were not significantly affected. Our results demonstrate that in almost all HIV-infected individuals B cell functional defects are the first leukocyte abnormalities observed preceding defects in T helper activity."
Doc No.979,7845,negative/unlabeled,7.8060064,Combination of immune and viral factors distinguishes low-risk versus high-risk HIV-1 disease progression in HLA-B*5701 subjects.,"HLA-B*5701 is the host factor most strongly associated with slow HIV-1 disease progression, although rates can vary within this group. Underlying mechanisms are not fully understood but likely involve both immunological and virological dynamics. The present study investigated HIV-1 in vivo evolution and epitope-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in six HLA-B*5701 patients who had not received antiretroviral treatment, monitored from early infection for up to 7 years. The subjects were classified as high-risk progressors (HRPs) or low-risk progressors (LRPs) based on baseline CD4(+) T cell counts. Dynamics of HIV-1 Gag p24 evolution and multifunctional CD8(+) T cell responses were evaluated by high-resolution phylogenetic analysis and polychromatic flow cytometry, respectively. In all subjects, substitutions occurred more frequently in flanking regions than in HLA-B*5701-restricted epitopes. In LRPs, p24 sequence diversity was significantly lower; sequences exhibited a higher degree of homoplasy and more constrained mutational patterns than HRPs. The HIV-1 intrahost evolutionary rate was also lower in LRPs and followed a strict molecular clock, suggesting neutral genetic drift rather than positive selection. Additionally, polyfunctional CD8(+) T cell responses, particularly to TW10 and QW9 epitopes, were more robust in LRPs, who also showed significantly higher interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in early infection. Overall, the findings indicate that HLA-B*5701 patients with higher CD4 counts at baseline have a lower risk of HIV-1 disease progression because of the interplay between specific HLA-linked immune responses and the rate and mode of viral evolution. The study highlights the power of a multidisciplinary approach, integrating high-resolution evolutionary and immunological data, to understand mechanisms underlying HIV-1 pathogenesis."
Doc No.980,1602,negative/unlabeled,7.80587,Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) gag DNA-vaccinated rhesus monkeys develop secondary cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses and control viral replication after pathogenic SIV infection.,"The potential contribution of a plasmid DNA construct to vaccine-elicited protective immunity was explored in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque model of AIDS. Making use of soluble major histocompatibility class I/peptide tetramers and peptide-specific killing assays to monitor CD8(+) T-lymphocyte responses to a dominant SIV Gag epitope in genetically selected rhesus monkeys, a codon-optimized SIV gag DNA vaccine construct was shown to elicit a high-frequency SIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. This CTL response was demonstrable in both peripheral blood and lymph node lymphocytes. Following an intravenous challenge with the highly pathogenic viral isolate SIVsm E660, these vaccinated monkeys developed a secondary CTL response that arose with more rapid kinetics and reached a higher frequency than did the postchallenge CTL response in control plasmid-vaccinated monkeys. While peak plasma SIV RNA levels were comparable in the experimentally and control-vaccinated monkeys during the period of primary infection, the gag plasmid DNA-vaccinated monkeys demonstrated better containment of viral replication by 50 days following SIV challenge. These findings indicate that a plasmid DNA vaccine can elicit SIV-specific CTL responses in rhesus monkeys, and this vaccine-elicited immunity can facilitate the generation of secondary CTL responses and control of viral replication following a pathogenic SIV challenge. These observations suggest that plasmid DNA may prove a useful component of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vaccine."
Doc No.981,6921,negative/unlabeled,7.8020625,Pancreatitis in pediatric human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"Because pancreatitis has been reported frequently in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection, we sought to determine the incidence of pancreatitis in children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome by reviewing all records of children with AIDS, their serum amylase and lipase levels, and the factors associated with pancreatitis through a case-control analysis. During a 6-year period pancreatitis developed in 9 (17%) of 53 pediatric patients with AIDS. Six children had vertical transmission of infection and three patients had acquired HIV infection through contaminated blood products. Pancreatitis developed at a median age of 5.2 years (range 1.2 to 20 years). All patients had vomiting and abdominal pain. When the patients were first seen, lipase values were elevated more than amylase values (p = 0.028). Amylase and lipase levels declined at comparable rates. In the case-control analysis, pentamidine isethionate was significantly associated with pancreatitis (p = 0.02); the risk was greater in patients who received pentamidine isethionate and had absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/mm3 (p = 0.001). Infections associated with the onset of pancreatitis included cytomegalovirus (4), Cryptosporidium (1), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (3), and Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (1). Coinfection with cytomegalovirus was associated with a protracted course in four children. Ultrasonographic examination demonstrated biliary ductal dilatation 6 months after the onset of pancreatitis in one child. Seven children have died at a mean of 8 months after the initial onset of pancreatitis; the one living child has survived 5 months from the onset of pancreatitis. We conclude that pancreatitis is common in pediatric patients with AIDS and may be related to pentamidine isethionate exposure, especially when absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts are less than 100 cells/mm3. Serum amylase levels do not always accurately predict the onset of pancreatitis; serum lipase levels should be measured in children with symptoms. The onset of pancreatitis in an HIV-infected child is a poor prognostic indicator."

Virus populations with greater than 100-fold-increased resistance to both inhibitors compared with the parental virus have been obtained. DNA sequence analyses of the protease genes from VB-11,328- and VX-478-resistant variants reveal a sequential accumulation of point mutations, with similar resistance patterns occurring for the two inhibitors. The deduced amino acid substitutions in the resistant protease are Leu-10-->Phe, Met-46-->Ile, Ile-47-->Val, and Ile-50-->Val. This is the first observation in HIV protease resistance studies of an Ile-50-->Val mutation, a mutation that appears to arise uniquely against the sulfonamide inhibitor class. When the substitutions observed were introduced as single mutations into an HIV-1 infectious clone (HXB2), only the Ile-50-->Val mutant showed reduced sensitivity (two- to threefold) to VB-11,328 and VX-478. A triple protease mutant infectious clone carrying the mutations Met-46-->Ile, Ile-47-->Val, and Ile-50-->Val, however, showed much greater reduction in sensitivity (14- to 20-fold) to VB-11,328 and VX-478. The same mutations were studied in recombinant HIV protease. The mutant protease Ile-50-->Val displays a much lower affinity for the inhibitors than the parent enzyme (< or = 80-fold). The protease triply mutated at Met-46-->Ile, Ile-47-->Val, and Ile-50-->Val shows an even greater decrease in inhibitor binding (< or = 270-fold). The sulfonamide-resistant HIV protease variants remain sensitive to inhibitors from other chemical classes (Ro 31-8959 and L-735,524), suggesting possibilities for clinical use of HIV protease inhibitors in combination or serially."

Since the HBV genotype F is the most prevalent in the country, the goal of this study was to obtain full HBV genome sequences from patients infected chronically in order to determine their subgenotypes and the occurrence of resistance-associated mutations. Twenty-one serum samples from antiviral drug-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B were subjected to full-length PCR amplification, and both strands of the whole genomes were fully sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses were performed along with reference sequences available from GenBank (n = 290). The sequences were aligned using Clustal X and edited in the SE-AL software. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were conducted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations (MCMC) for 10 million generations in order to obtain the substitution tree using BEAST. The sequences were also analyzed for the presence of primary drug resistance mutations using CodonCode Aligner Software. The phylogenetic analyses indicated that all sequences were found to be the HBV subgenotype F1b, clustered into four different groups, suggesting that diverse lineages of this subgenotype may be circulating within this population of Chilean patients."

We assessed 244 HIV-positive participants in an HIV intervention targeting drug users (1997-99). Fifty-seven per cent of HIV-positive participants reported unprotected sex within the past 90 days, 16.4% with serodiscordant partners. Odds of risky sex were lower among those currently receiving HIV medical care (odds ratio (OR)=0.36), and were greater among females (OR=2.6), those having friends with lower norms of condom use (OR=3.3), and those having a main sexual partner (OR=6.2). Lower odds of receiving HIV medical care were associated with current drug use (OR=0.33), sharing drugs with a sex partner (OR=0.27), and exchanging sex for drugs or money (OR=0.24). Findings suggest the importance of community-based HIV prevention intervention targeting HIV-positive drug users not recovery HIV medical care."

In this report, we describe inhibition of HIV-1 transcription by synthetic dsRNAs constructed with mutated nef genes (nef dsRNAs) derived from long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) using cotransfection of the target gene-expressing plasmid and dsRNA. The effects of nef dsRNAs were examined with luciferase (Luc) reporter which is combined with the HIV-1 (SF2) LTR in persistently HIV-1-infected T cell and macrophage cell lines. At 48 hr, a defective nef dsRNA (556 nt) suppressed Luc activity more potently than did SF2 full-length nef dsRNA (744 nt), suggesting that approximately 500 nt-long nef dsRNA could interfere with the HIV-1 transcription."

Although administration of antiretroviral agents and interleukin-2 (IL-2) augment depleted CD4+ T-cell numbers, such therapies have been preferentially beneficial for CD45RO+ T cells. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) exhibits many biological activities in common with IL-2, including promoting T-cell survival and proliferation. The present study found that these two cytokines differed in their ability to induce proliferation, enhance survival, and control apoptosis of CD45RO+ and CD45RO- T-cell populations of human immunodeficiency- (HIV) infected individuals. When used at equivalent concentrations in vitro, IL-15 was more potent than IL-2 in activating and stimulating proliferation of CD4+CD45RO+, CD8+CD45RO+ and CD8+CD45RO- cells, but failed to be more effective than IL-2 in reducing apoptosis. Poor activation of CD4+CD45RO- cells by IL-15 and to IL-2 appeared to be attributable to low expression of the beta receptor chain utilized by both cytokines. However, IL-15 was more effective than IL-2 in enhancing survival of the CD4+CD45RO- population, suggesting a greater protective effect of IL-15 for naive CD4+ T cells, which are preferentially lost in HIV-infected individuals."

However, its role in modulating astroglial-neuronal relationships is poorly understood. Astrocyte infection with HIV has been associated with rapid progression of dementia. We thus initially transfected astrocytes with HIV proviral DNA and confirmed Tat production in these cells. Subsequently, using stably Tat-producing asytocyte cell lines, we observed that Tat promoted astrocyte survival by causing a prominent antioxidant effect and resistance to cell injury in these cells. Tat was released extracellularly where it could be taken up by other cells. Tat remained functionally active following uptake and caused long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation in lymphocytic and astrocytic cell lines. Tat released from astrocytes caused mitochondrial dysfunction, trimming of neurites, and cell death in neurons. Tat neurotoxicity was attenuated by anti-Tat antibodies, kynurenate or heparan sulfate. The neurotoxic effects of Tat were caused at concentrations lower than that needed to cause LTR transactivation. When Tat-expressing cells were injected into the rat dentate gyrus, Tat was taken up by granule cells and transported along neuronal pathways to the CA3 region where it caused glial cell activation and neurotoxicity. The arginine-rich domain of Tat was essential for both the LTR transactivation and the neurotoxic properties of Tat. Thus HIV-Tat is a potent neurotoxin that may act at distant sites while at the same time it assures its production by preventing cell death in astrocytes where it is produced."

This propensity is more pronounced in AIDS, where opportunistic parasitic infections may cause severe diarrhea, marked absorptive dysfunction, and significant risk of mortality. There are scant data regarding parasitic infections among HIV patients in the developed world; most studies and research come from povertystricken areas of South Africa, India, Iran, and the South Pacific. Although multiple infections with the same or different parasites have been reported, simultaneous infections are rare. We present the case of a 35-year-old man who developed a co-infection with Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides, simultaneously, the diagnosis being made after the judicious evaluation of a stool sample. Given the associated morbidity, prompt diagnosis and treatment are needed to avoid further complications in patients with HIV. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of triple parasitic infection in a patient with HIV. "

We studied the immune distribution, diversity, and inducibility of total HIV-DNA among the following cell subsets: monocytes, peripheral blood activated and resting CD4 T cells, long-lived (naive [TN] and central-memory [TCM]) and short-lived (transitional-memory [TTM] and effector-memory cells [TEM]) resting CD4+T cells from 12 acutely-infected individuals recruited at a median 36 days from infection. Cells were sorted for total HIV-DNA quantification, phylogenetic analysis and inducibility, all studied in relation to activation status and cell signaling. One month post-infection, a single CCR5-restricted viral cluster was massively distributed in all resting CD4+ subsets from 88% subjects, while one subject showed a slight diversity. High levels of total HIV-DNA were measured among TN (median 3.4 log copies/million cells), although 10-fold less (p = 0.0005) than in equally infected TCM (4.5), TTM (4.7) and TEM (4.6) cells. CD3-CD4+ monocytes harbored a low viral burden (median 2.3 log copies/million cells), unlike equally infected resting and activated CD4+ T cells (4.5 log copies/million cells). The skewed repartition of resting CD4 subsets influenced their contribution to the pool of resting infected CD4+T cells, two thirds of which consisted of short-lived TTM and TEM subsets, whereas long-lived TN and TCM subsets contributed the balance. Each resting CD4 subset produced HIV in vitro after stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28+IL-2 with kinetics and magnitude varying according to subset differentiation, while IL-7 preferentially induced virus production from long-lived resting TN cells. In conclusion, within a month of infection, a clonal HIV-1 cluster is massively distributed among resting CD4 T-cell subsets with a flexible inducibility, suggesting that subset activation and skewed immune homeostasis determine the conditions of viral dissemination and early establishment of the HIV reservoir."
Doc No.992,9754,negative/unlabeled,7.7800364,New tools to expand regulatory T cells from HIV-1-infected individuals.,"CD4+ Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are potent immune modulators and serve an important function in human immune homeostasis. Depletion of Tregs has led to measurable increases in antigen-specific T cell responses in vaccine settings for cancer and infectious pathogens. However, their role in HIV-1 immuno-pathogenesis remains controversial, as they could either serve to suppress deleterious HIV-1-associated immune activation and thus slow HIV-1 disease progression or alternatively suppress HIV-1-specific immunity and thereby promote virus spread. Understanding and modulating Treg function in the context of HIV-1 could lead to potential new strategies for immunotherapy or HIV vaccines. However, important open questions remain on their role in the context of HIV-1 infection, which needs to be carefully studied. Representing roughly 5% of human CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood, studying the Treg population has proven to be difficult, especially in HIV-1 infected individuals where HIV-1-associated CD4 T cell and with that Treg depletion occurs. The characterization of regulatory T cells in individuals with advanced HIV-1 disease or tissue samples, for which only very small biological samples can be obtained, is therefore extremely challenging. We propose a technical solution to overcome these limitations using isolation and expansion of Tregs from HIV-1-positive individuals. Here we describe an easy and robust method to successfully expand Tregs isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals in vitro. Flow-sorted CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low) Tregs were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads and cultured in the presence of IL-2. The expanded Tregs expressed high levels of FOXP3, CTLA4 and HELIOS compared to conventional T cells and were shown to be highly suppressive. Easier access to large numbers of Tregs will allow researchers to address important questions concerning their role in HIV-1 immunopathogenesis. We believe answering these questions may provide useful insight for the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine."
Doc No.993,8468,negative/unlabeled,7.776991,The precore/core promoter mutant (T1762A1764) of hepatitis B virus: clinical significance and an easy method for detection.,"Recently, a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutant with HBe antigen-negative phenotype has been characterized, in which one TATA box-like motif of the precore/core promoter had degenerated: most frequently by both A-->T and G-->A mutations at positions 1762 and 1764, respectively. The clinical significance of this mutant is as yet unknown. In our present study, the T1762 A1764 mutant was sought in sera from HBV-infected blood donors and chronic liver disease patients by directly sequencing a PCR-amplified region of HBVDNA. Also, because the A1764 mutation generates a Sau3AI cleavage site (GGTC-->GATC), we digested the PCR products with Sau3AI to see if cleavage would occur at this specific site. Our results mostly corroborated the earlier report but we found a higher-than-predicted frequency of HBe antigen-positive blood donors positive for the mutant (22%). The titres of HBe antigen in these mutant-positive sera were slightly decreased compared to the titres in wild-type HBV infection. In addition, these blood donors had relatively high (though within the normal range) serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, suggesting that the T1762 A1764 mutation could be used as a sensitive laboratory marker for insidious hepatitis in these otherwise 'asymptomatic' carriers. The Sau3AI assay, which is much more convenient than sequencing, was shown to be useful for the detection of the T1762 A1764 mutant in an extensive number of clinical samples."
Doc No.994,6434,negative/unlabeled,7.771788,High prevalence of 1762(T) 1764(A) mutations in the basic core promoter of hepatitis B virus isolated from black Africans with hepatocellular carcinoma compared with asymptomatic carriers.,"The purpose of this study was to identify mutations in the basic core promoter and enhancer II region of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that might cause the HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-negative phenotype and contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis in black African carriers of the virus. The basic core promoter/enhancer II overlaps with the X gene. HBV DNA from serum of 47 asymptomatic carriers and 50 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and from 28 tumor and 10 nontumor liver tissues was amplified and sequenced directly. That part of the enhancer II region not overlapping the basic core promoter was completely conserved in all samples. Missense mutations at nucleotides 1809 and 1812 in the basic core promoter were found in 80% of all sequences and may represent wild-type sequence in Southern African isolates. Nucleotide and amino acid divergences were higher in the basic core promoter of hepatocellular carcinoma patients when compared with asymptomatic carriers (P <.0001). This applied particularly to the paired 1762 adenine to thymine (1762(T)) and 1764 guanine to adenine (1764(A)) missense mutations, the prevalence of which was 66% in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma compared with 11% in asymptomatic carriers (P <.0001). There was no association between the presence of 1762(T) 1764(A) and HBeAg negativity, although these mutations suppressed HBeAg titers in HBeAg-positive patients. Suppression of HBeAg expression as well as alteration of the amino acid sequence of the X protein may play a role in hepatocarcinogenesis."
Doc No.995,5335,negative/unlabeled,7.769272,CD4+ T cell recovery beyond the first year of complete suppression of viral replication during highly active antiretroviral therapy is not influenced by CD8+ T cell activation.,"CD38 expression on CD8(+) T cells was longitudinally assessed in 31 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons with undetectable plasma viremia who had undergone highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for 12 months and were followed for a mean of 30 months thereafter. Overall, CD4(+)T cell counts increased during follow-up, whereas CD38 expression remained stable. However, a subset of patients showed declines in CD38 expression, and, conversely, another subset showed increases in CD38 expression. No association could be found between long-term gains in CD4(+) T cells and evolution of CD38 expression. Thus, activation of CD8(+) T cells does not seem to be associated with the extent of CD4(+) T cell recovery beyond the first year of successful HAART."
Doc No.996,9409,negative/unlabeled,7.7688384,Ribavirin pharmacodynamics in high-risk patients for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.,"Ribavirin was administered orally in escalating doses for 2 or 4 weeks to 15 symptom-free, human immunodeficiency virus seropositive homosexual men with generalized lymphadenopathy. Reverse transcriptase activity was inhibited during therapy when steady-state plasma concentrations were greater than 6 mumol/L. These concentrations were achieved with 1200 or 2400 mg/day for 2 weeks or a loading dose of 2400 mg/day for 3 days followed by 600 mg/day for 4 weeks. Drug accumulation occurred at all doses. The elimination half-life appeared to be approximately 2 weeks. Reversible adverse reactions, principally resulting in central nervous system symptoms and anemia, correlated with dose and duration of therapy. Immunologic enhancement of T-lymphocyte-mediated mitogen-induced responses was observed in the majority of patients who had reduction in reverse transcriptase activity. However, specific T4+ lymphocyte-mediated antigen-induced responses increased to within the normal range in only three patients. Significant enhancement appeared to correlate with the severity of baseline antigen-induced functional impairment. These data indicate that oral ribavirin can be given for at least 1 month with acceptable toxicity at doses that appear to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus replication."
Doc No.997,2267,negative/unlabeled,7.7681775,High levels of drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus variants in patients exhibiting increasing CD4+ T cell counts despite virologic failure of protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral combination therapy.,"The genotypic mutations associated with indinavir resistance were analyzed in 27 patients who exhibited sustained CD4+ T cell responses to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), despite virologic failure of treatment. After 12 months of HAART, 1 or 2 primary resistance mutations had occurred in 18 (66%) of the patients, and secondary mutations had accumulated in 22 (88%) of the patients. The number and patterns of mutations in the patients who exhibited discrepant responses to HAART did not differ from those observed in patients who exhibited immunologic and virologic failure to therapy. Results indicate that many patients have prolonged immunologic benefits, despite the development of virologic failure and protease inhibitor mutations. The clinical course of this group of patients calls into question the relevance of genotypic resistance and plasma human immunodeficiency virus RNA level as surrogate markers in patients receiving HAART."
Doc No.998,4991,positive/labeled,7.7676425,Correlates of alcohol and/or drug use among HIV-infected individuals.,"The purpose of this article is to describe the psychosocial factors associated with alcohol and/or drug (AOD) use among HIV-infected individuals. Their attitudes toward AOD use are also examined. Three hundred and three HIV-infected adults completed a survey on AOD use while waiting for their appointment at the largest, HIV-outpatient clinic in the Gulf South. Logistic regression showed that associating with others who use drugs and hospitalization for a mental illness were associated with current AOD use. Variables derived from the AIDS Risk Reduction Model that integrates elements of the Health Belief Model, efficacy theory, and social network theory, indicated that 14% of the sample admitted to having an AOD problem. Twenty-six percent of the AOD users reported that they have little social support to help them stop their AOD use. A disturbing finding was that 24% of the AOD users have actively sought help or treatment for their AOD problem and have not been able to find help. These patients differ significantly from the AOD users who could find help in that they are primarily African-American and 46% have been hospitalized for a mental illness. Motivational strategies and mental health interventions are necessary, which provide peer counseling and social support, factors that have been found to greatly influence behavior change. The intervention may also need to include spiritual and humor components because the vast majority of AOD users are interested in treatment approaches that include these two elements."
Doc No.999,5106,negative/unlabeled,7.76532,Tim-3 expression defines a novel population of dysfunctional T cells with highly elevated frequencies in progressive HIV-1 infection.,"Progressive loss of T cell functionality is a hallmark of chronic infection with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). We have identified a novel population of dysfunctional T cells marked by surface expression of the glycoprotein Tim-3. The frequency of this population was increased in HIV-1-infected individuals to a mean of 49.4 +/- SD 12.9% of CD8(+) T cells expressing Tim-3 in HIV-1-infected chronic progressors versus 28.5 +/- 6.8% in HIV-1-uninfected individuals. Levels of Tim-3 expression on T cells from HIV-1-infected inviduals correlated positively with HIV-1 viral load and CD38 expression and inversely with CD4(+) T cell count. In progressive HIV-1 infection, Tim-3 expression was up-regulated on HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells. Tim-3-expressing T cells failed to produce cytokine or proliferate in response to antigen and exhibited impaired Stat5, Erk1/2, and p38 signaling. Blocking the Tim-3 signaling pathway restored proliferation and enhanced cytokine production in HIV-1-specific T cells. Thus, Tim-3 represents a novel target for the therapeutic reversal of HIV-1-associated T cell dysfunction."
Doc No.1000,4338,negative/unlabeled,7.7652173,Infectivity of wild-type and deleted proviral SIV DNA.,"Live attenuated lentiviruses are potentially effective candidate HIV vaccines; however, delivery of these viruses in the field would be problematic. Delivery of attenuated lentiviruses as proviral DNA would be a simple means of immunization, but the efficiency of this method of delivery is not known. In this study, macaques were readily infected following inoculation of plasmid DNA encoding proviral simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac239), whether given i.m. (300 microg) or epidermally (15 microg), with all four animals succumbing to AIDS at a mean of 26 weeks following inoculation. Using a human skin explant model, we found that the 50% infectious dose (ID50) of proviral SIV or HIV-1 plasmid may be as low as 1 microg when delivered to skin by gold particle bombardment using a gene gun. An infectious proviral clone of SIV mac239 with a 105 bp deletion in the 3' nef/LTR overlap region was engineered (SIVsbbc delta3), analogous to the initial common nef/LTR deletion in HIV-1 strains isolated from an Australian cohort of long-term slow-progressors. Two further macaques were also readily infected with SIVsbbc delta3 after i.m. injection of 300 microg of highly purified plasmid DNA. Unexpectedly, in one macaque inoculated with SIVsbbc delta3 DNA, SIV strains isolated three to six weeks after infection had completely repaired the nef/LTR deletion with wild-type sequence, and eventually progressed to AIDS. The mechanism used to rebuild this deletion with wild-type sequence, presumably derived from an intact 5' LTR, is unclear, but possibilities include RNA read-through errors from the plasmid DNA and recombination with residual plasmid DNA at the inoculation site."
Doc No.1001,3807,negative/unlabeled,7.7637606,HIV-1 extrachromosomal 2-LTR circular DNA is long-lived in human macrophages.,"HIV-1 extrachromosomal 2-LTR circles (cc2LTR) are rapidly lost in dividing cell populations and, therefore, might be interpreted as representing new infection and ongoing viral replication. However, recent work demonstrated that cc2LTR persist in infected, growth-arrested T cell lines beyond their predicted half-life as previously determined in dividing cell populations. In this study, the evaluation of the stability of cc2LTR was extended to include primary human macrophages, a natural, non-dividing target of HIV-1. By quantitative real-time PCR, cc2LTR were found to persist out to 21 days post-infection in macrophages infected with both integrase competent and integrase- defective, recombinant HIV-1, whereas in activated CD4(+) T lymphocytes, they rapidly decreased over time. This persistence was associated with persistent, low level expression of the indicator gene, luciferase. These data suggest that the presence of HIV-1 cc2LTR in the PBMC of HIV-1-infected patients on suppressive HAART could be due either to ongoing generation of newly infected dividing cells, or persistence of circles in non-dividing cell populations where they appear to be stable. Furthermore, exrachromosomal circular DNA in this cell population could be a source of persisent viral protein expression."
