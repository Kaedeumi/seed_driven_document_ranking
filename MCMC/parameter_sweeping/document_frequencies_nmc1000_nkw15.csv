7098,0.066,66.0000,"Only some twenty years has passed since the first discovery of severe immunodeficiency among previously healthy homosexual men through the discovery of the causing virus and till the status today where the knowledge on the HIV virus and the pathogenic mechanisms induced by the virus are extensive, though still incomplete. Furthermore, steadily better treatments have been introduced at a paste that is probably without precedents. These processes have been fuelled by various molecular biological methods. The abilities to quantify viremia and to sequence virus and hence describe the evolution of the virus represent valuable tools for understanding the pathogenic processes. The current thesis describes some of the findings obtained. While it was initially thought that the virological profile mimicked the clinical with an acute infection followed for years by clinical latency and only after on average ten years signs of severe immunodeficiency, this understanding has been revised. There is no virological latency. The viral replication is on going throughout the infection. However, the virological profile does resemble the clinical. Viremia is high shortly after infection; hereafter declines, and stabilises around what has been termed the viral set point. This level of viremia is predictive of the clinical course of the infection. We have shown that the viremic levels, measured both as HIV RNA load and proviral DNA load, early in infection carry significant information about the course of the infection. It is; however, not only early viral loads that carry prognostic information, also viral load during late-stage infection is clinically informative. Viral load measurements have evolved as the major tool for monitoring the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy. HIV RNA has been shown to be a good surrogate marker for the clinical efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. How to use the measurements most optimally has however not been fully delineated. Various methods for describing virological response might yield different results, and it is recommended that the pros and cons of the various methods be investigated. In a cohort of patients who had obtained good virological suppression on antiretroviral therapy followed prospectively for two years we found that only few patients experienced high-grade viremia. Furthermore, baseline HIV DNA differed between the patients with various longitudinal HIV RNA profiles. The patients with the most pronounced HIV RNA suppression had lowest proviral load at baseline, with a clear gradient across the groups. The interplay between proviral load and treatment response deserves further investigations. Resistance can develop against all the available antiretrovirals. The high turnover rate of HIV along with the error-prone reverse transcriptase leads to the possibility of steady accumulation of resistance mutations if the viremic suppression is incomplete. While the interplay between viremia and resistance development is clear-cut for some antiretrovirals i.e. Lamivudine, the pattern is more complex for i.e. Zidovudine. With the availability of assays for resistances testing the knowledge on this issue has been ever evolving. How to use resistance testing in the clinical monitoring of patients remains to be clarified. Resistance testing can aid in the process of choosing salvage therapy for patients experiencing virological failure. Whether resistance testing will be of clinical benefit in other situations remains to be determined. Investigation of the viral sequences and evolution herein has not only been used for resistance analyses, but also for tracing the spread of the infection. HIV-1 exists in many subtypes, with various geographic distributions. Hence subtype analyses have been used to investigate the introduction and spread of the HIV infection into many countries. Phylogenetic analyses have also been used to investigate nosocomial transmission events. We used analyses of env and gag sequences to trace a case of nosocomial infection at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Denmark. The study underlines the importance of steady awareness of the infection control precautions and possible breaks herein. The usefulness of this type of analyses was confirmed. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic various replicative patterns were described. Virus obtained from patients with late-stage infection often had virus that could induce syncytium formation (SI) when cultured, while virus obtained from patients in the early stages of infection did not have this ability. A correlation between the SI ability and the ability to yield high virus titres rapidly as well as the ability to establish infection in certain cell lines was found. Patients infected with SI virus experience more rapid clinical deterioration. We found that patients harbouring SI virus have HIV RNA loads no different from patients harbouring NSI virus. This is in line with the findings of other groups. Though patients harbouring SI virus had a more rapid development of resistance when treated with nucleoside reserve transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI's) monotherapy, this was not the case when treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HAART is today considered the treatment modality of choice; both for established HIV-infection and in cases where post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is given in order to prevent establishment of infection after exposure. In a case of transfusion of HIV-contaminated though HIV antibody negative blood the recipient was treated with HAART. As the risk of infection is close to 100% under these circumstances the fact that the recipient remained uninfected is probably attributable to the prompt initiation and thorough maintenance of PEP. PEP is recommended to health care workers after percutaneous HIV exposure as well as after sexual exposure. Even with NRTI monotherapy PEP has been shown to be efficacious. While the explanation for the dichotomy (SI vs. NSI) was for many years unresolved, it is now known that this is due to the requirements of the virus for different co-receptors for cell entry. SI virus uses mainly CXCR4 while NSI virus uses CCR5. Being heterozygous for a 32 basepair deletion in the gene encoding CCR5 leads to slower disease progression. We have shown that heterozygotes have lower HIV RNA levels in the early years of the infection, possibly explaining the clinical advantage of having the deletion. HIV replicates in activated cells, and there is an intriguing interplay between HIV replication and immune activation. HIV-infected patients have elevated levels of immunoglobulins. HIV induces polygonal immunoglobulin production. We found that patients experiencing good virological suppression of HAART had lower IgA levels than patients with less complete viral suppression. Whether IgA can be used as a marker for imminent viral break-through remains to be determined. The full understanding of the interplay between immune activation and HIV replication awaits further studies. The finding of increased viremia in conjunction with acute bacterial or viral infection led to concerns about the safety of vaccinating HIV-infected patients against influenza and pneumococcal infection. We found no difference in HIV RNA levels measured before and median 42 days after anti-pneumococcal vaccination. This is in line with many other studies showing either no or only transient increases in viremia. In conclusion, the knowledge on HIV virology has expanded tremendously. This has led to significant improvements in treatments in the Western World leading to declines in HIV morbidity and mortality. The ability to quantify viral load and to perform sequence analyses represent valuable tools both for understanding the pathogenic actions of the virus and for the clinical monitoring of HIV-infected patients. The optimal usage of these tools in the clinical setting, however, still remains to be defined. The progresses obtained have unfortunately been restricted to the Western World and the calamities of HIV is spreading and worsening in the Developing World. The progress in the development of a vaccine has been disappointing and it is urgently necessary that the progresses obtained within the fields of prevention and treatment are translated into useful strategies in the parts of the world mostly affected by the HIV pandemic."
5542,0.023,23.0000,"Introduction of antiretroviral combination therapy has profoundly altered both the course and prognosis of the disease in HIV-infected persons. Indeed, protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral combination therapy dramatically decreased morbidity and mortality and improved quality of life of HIV-infected persons. Recent data, however, have raised concerns that antiretroviral combination therapy is associated with premature manifestation of coronary artery disease. In particular, protease inhibitors have been linked to metabolic changes such as insulin resistance, abnormalities in lipid metabolism and lipodystrophy and increased coronary artery calcification. Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions whether the incidence of myocardial infarction is indeed increased in this patient population. The most substantial database has recently been provided by the D:A:D study group who demonstrated an increased incidence of myocardial infarction in HIV-infected persons on protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-containing therapy in a prospective observational cohort study. Much about the mechanisms involved leading to this finding remain elusive. Surrogate markers such as endothelial function may help to delineate potential mechanisms. Endothelial dysfunction is a key event in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease. It is characterized by decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Furthermore endothelial ""activation"" leading to a pro-inflammatory, proliferative and prothrombotic state of the endothelium occurs. The observed accelerated atherosclerosis could either be caused by the virus infection itself or by a side effect of antiretroviral therapy, protease inhibitors in particular. Experimental studies demonstrate a direct impact of viral components (gp120, TAT) on the endothelium, as they lead to expression of adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM], E-selectin), a prothrombotic state (increase of von Willebrand factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-[PAI-]1, tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA], tissue factor). In addition, soluble adhesion molecules (sE-selectin, ICAM) were found to be increased in HIV-infected persons. Impaired flow-mediated dilation can already be detected in HIV-infected children, independent of antiretroviral therapy. Another study showed a correlation between viral load and flow-mediated dilation, supporting the notion of infection/inflammation as a contributor to endothelial dysfunction. The influence of protease inhibitor therapy on the endothelium was investigated in several studies in vitro and in vivo. In experimental studies certain protease inhibitors downregulated eNOS expression, and induced CD36 scavenger receptor expression. Furthermore, apoptosis, radical oxygen species (ROS), proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelin-1 were found to be increased. There is conflicting evidence about adhesion molecules, as some investigators detected a decrease by therapy, others did not see an effect. In clinical studies all but one investigator found endothelial function to be impaired in HIV-infected persons on protease inhibitor-containing regimens. An important study to underline the hypothesis of a link between protease inhibitor therapy comes from Dubé et al. showing that in healthy volunteers, indinavir caused impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation after 4 weeks. In a wide variety of clinical conditions lipid-lowering therapy using statins has shown to improve endothelial function as well as hard clinical endpoints. Drug interactions caused by common metabolism of protease inhibitors and most statins by the P450 3A4 pathway limit the use of these drugs it this setting. Pravastatin, which is being metabolized independently of P450 enzymes, was tested in several studies. In one study a trend toward improvement of endothelial function was observed. In an own similar study the authors recently provided evidence of a significant improvement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in 30 HIV-infected persons. These studies support current guidelines of treating protease inhibitor-associated dyslipidemia with statins, preferably pravastatin.. Many questions remain unanswered in the context of antiretroviral therapy and cardiovascular risk. Results gained from research of endothelial function have served to delineate certain potential mechanisms, much work is yet to be done."
6125,0.012,12.0000,"Increased coronary heart disease risk in HIV-positive patients using antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been a controversial topic since 1998 when the dyslipidaemic effect of protease inhibitors (PIs) was recognised. Accumulating evidence suggests an association between ART and increased coronary heart disease risk. In 2003, the large, prospective D:A:D (Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs) study reported a 26% relative increase in the rate of myocardial infarction per year of exposure during the first 4-6 years of use. As the HIV-population grows older, infectious disease specialists have to consider unfamiliar areas of internal medicine such as lipid-lowering therapy and smoking cessation. Moreover, the ART regimen itself may be a modifiable risk factor, as there are both class differences and within-class differences in the tendency to increase lipids. Most nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), including the newer agents tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine, have little or no effect on lipid levels or glucose metabolism. One exception is the highly effective NRTI stavudine, which has a dyslipidaemic profile and a negative effect on glucose metabolism. In contrast the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine may increase the 'good cholesterol' high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and thus reduce the total cholesterol : HDL cholesterol index. Most of the PIs have some dyslipidaemic effect, especially ritonavir (alone or in combination with other PIs), fosamprenavir and the novel PI tipranavir. Only atazanavir, and to some extent saquinavir, seem to have little effect on lipid levels and glucose metabolism. Studies on blood pressure in HIV-positive patients have been contradictory. Apart from a recent report from the D:A:D study where lower blood pressure was found in patients receiving NNRTIs, the influence of the individual drugs on blood pressure is unknown. When hypertension is detected in a HIV-positive patient, creatinine clearance (CL(CR)) should be calculated and the urine checked for proteinuria. When CL(CR) is <30 mL/min, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended. Many hypertensive HIV-positive patients have proteinuria and an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist is a better choice than a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel antagonist in these patients. In addition, physicians treating patients with ART should be especially aware of the long list of possible interactions between PIs and anti-hypertensive- and lipid-lowering drugs. This review discusses important clinical aspects of treating middle-aged HIV-positive patients who have an increased risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event."
4038,0.009,9.0000,"Pegylated-IFN and ribavirin remains the current treatment for chronic HCV infection in patients co-infected with HIV-1, but this regimen has low efficacy rates, particularly for HCV genotype 1/4 infection, has severe side effects and is extremely costly. Therefore, accurate prediction of treatment response is urgently required. We have recently shown that the NK cell gene, KIR2DS3 and a SNP associated with the IL28B gene synergise to increase the risk of chronic infection in primary HCV mono-infected patients. Identification of SNPs associated with the IL28B gene has also proven very powerful for predicting patient response to treatment. Patients co-infected with HIV-1 are of particular concern given they respond less well to HCV treatment, have more side effects and suffer a more rapid liver disease progression. In this study, we examined both IL28B and KIR2DS3 for their ability to predict treatment response in a cohort of HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients attending two treatment centres in Europe. We found that variation in both host genetic risk factors, IL28B and KIR2DS3, was strongly associated with sustained virological response (SVR) to treatment in our co-infected cohort (n = 149). The majority of patients who achieved a rapid virological response (RVR) achieved a SVR. However, it is currently impossible to predict treatment outcome in patients who fail to achieve an RVR. In our cohort, the presence of host genetic risk factors, IL28B-T and KIR2DS3 alleles, resulted in increased odds of treatment failure in these RVR negative patients (n = 88). Our data suggests that testing for host genetic factors will improve predicting treatment responsiveness in the clinical management of co-infected patients, and provides further evidence of the importance of the innate immune system in the immune response to HCV.

6847,0.009,9.0000,"Children and adolescents are at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Transmission occurs through perinatal exposures, injecting drug use, consensual and nonconsensual sex, needle-stick and sharp injuries, and possibly some unusual contacts. Youth engaging in high-risk sexual activities are especially endangered. Half of the estimated worldwide 5.3 million new HIV infections occur in adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24. Of 20 000 known new adult and adolescent cases in the United States, 25% involve 13- to 21-year-olds. More than 1.4 million children worldwide (aged 15 and younger) are believed to be infected, and >1640 new cases are diagnosed daily. Of the 432 000 people reported to be living with HIV or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States, 5575 are children under 13. HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a form of secondary HIV prevention that may reduce the incidence of HIV infections. HIV PEP is commonly conceived of as 2 types: occupational and nonoccupational. Occupational HIV PEP is an accepted form of therapy for health care workers exposed to HIV through their jobs. A landmark study of healthcare workers concluded that occupational HIV PEP may be efficacious. Well-established US national guidelines for occupational HIV PEP exist for this at-risk population. Nonoccupational HIV PEP includes all other forms of HIV PEP, such as that given after sexual assault and consensual sex, injecting drug use, and needle-stick and sharp injuries in non-health care persons. Pediatric HIV PEP is typically the nonoccupational type. The efficacy of nonoccupational HIV PEP is unknown. The presumed efficacy is based on a collection of animal and human data concerning occupational, perinatal, and nonoccupational exposures to HIV. In contrast to occupational HIV PEP, there are no national US guidelines for nonoccupational HIV PEP, and few recommendations are available for its use for adolescents and children. Regardless of this absence, there is encouraging evidence supporting the value of HIV PEP in its various forms in pediatrics. Although unproven, the presumed mechanism for HIV PEP comes from animal and human work suggesting that shortly after an exposure to HIV, a window period exists during which the viral load is small enough to be controlled by the body's immune system. Antiretroviral medications given during this period may help to diminish or end viral replication, thereby reducing the viral inoculum to a more potentially manageable target for the host's defenses. HIV PEP is accepted practice in the perinatal setting and for health care workers with occupational injuries. The medical literature supports prescribing HIV PEP after community needle-stick and sharp injuries and after sexual assault from sources known or likely to be HIV-infected. HIV PEP after consensual unprotected intercourse between HIV sero-opposite partners has had growing use in the adult population, and can probably be utilized for children and adolescents. There is less documented experience and support for HIV PEP after consensual unprotected intercourse between partners of unknown HIV status, after prolonged or multiple episodes of sexual abuse from an assailant of unknown HIV status, after bites, and after the sharing of personal hygiene items or exposure to wounds of HIV-infected individuals. There are no formal guidelines for HIV PEP in adolescents and children. A few groups have commented on its provision in pediatrics, and some preliminary studies have been released. Our article provides a discussion of the data available on HIV transmission and HIV PEP in pediatrics. In our article, we propose an HIV PEP approach for adolescents and children. We recommend a stratified regimen, based on the work of Gerberding and Katz and other authors, that attempts to match seroconversion risk with an appropriate number of medications, while taking into account adverse side-effects and the amount of information that is typically available upon initial presentation. Twice daily regimens should be used when possible, and may improve compliance. HIV PEP should be administered within 1 hour of exposure. We strongly recommend that physicians trained in this form of therapy review the indications for HIV PEP within 72 hours of its provision. We advocate that due diligence in determining level of risk and appropriateness of drug selection be conducted as soon as possible after an exposure has occurred. When such information is not immediately available, we recommend the rapid treatment using the maximum level of care followed by careful investigation and reconsideration in follow-up or whenever possible. HIV PEP may be initiated provisionally after an exposure and then discontinued if the exposure source is confirmed to not be HIV-infected. In most cases, consultations with the experts in HIV care can occur after the rapid start of therapy. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"
9217,0.008,8.0000,"Indinavir is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with HIV infection. Combination antiretroviral therapy with indinavir plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is associated with greater reductions in viral load, greater increases in CD4+ cell counts, and reduced morbidity and mortality when compared with 2 NRTIs alone. In the landmark clinical trial ACTG 320, the rate of progression to AIDS or death (primary end-point) among zidovudine-experienced patients treated with indinavir, zidovudine and lamivudine was approximately half that of patients who received only zidovudine plus lamivudine (6 vs 11%; p < 0.001). The durability of an indinavir-containing regimen was demonstrated in Merck protocol 035, an ongoing trial in which a significant proportion of patients had sustained viral suppression for up to 3 years. Merck protocol 039, also an ongoing trial, showed a greater effect on surrogate markers of HIV disease progression with indinavir-based triple therapy than with zidovudine plus lamivudine or indinavir monotherapy in patients with advanced disease (median baseline CD4+ count 15 cells/microL). Numerous additional clinical trials have established the beneficial antiviral and immunological effects of indinavir in both antiretroviral-naive and -experienced patients with HIV infection. Indinavir is associated with various drug class-related adverse events, including gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. nausea, diarrhoea), headache and asthenia/fatigue. A lipodystrophy syndrome has been commonly reported with indinavir and other protease inhibitors combined with NRTIs, but it has also been reported in many protease inhibitor-naive patients, and a definitive causal link has not been established between the syndrome and protease inhibitors. Nephrolithiasis may develop in about 9% of patients receiving indinavir but does not appear to be associated with other protease inhibitors; <0.5% of patients receiving indinavir discontinue the drug because of nephrolithiasis, which may be the extreme end of a continuum of crystal-related renal syndromes. Additional renal problems (e.g. nephropathy) have been reported in small numbers of patients receiving indinavir. In summary, indinavir is a protease inhibitor with well documented efficacy when used as part of combined therapy in patients with HIV infection. Both US and UK treatment guidelines continue to recommend protease inhibitor-based regimens including indinavir as a first-line option. Indinavir is being studied as a twice daily and once daily regimen with a low dosage of ritonavir as a way to alleviate tolerability, drug interaction and patient compliance/adherence issues. Indinavir-containing triple therapy has demonstrated positive effects not only on surrogate markers of disease progression, but also on clinical end-points of mortality and morbidity in patients with HIV disease. Protease inhibitors are a significant advance in the care of patients with HIV infection, and, in an era of evidence-based medicine, indinavir represents an important component of antiretroviral treatment strategies."
6919,0.008,8.0000,"This consensus document has been prepared by a panel consisting of members of the AIDS Study Group (Gesida) and the Spanish Secretariat for the National Plan on AIDS (SPNS) after reviewing the efficacy and safety results of clinical trials, cohort and pharmacokinetic studies published in medical journals, or presented in medical scientific meetings. Gesida has prepared an objective and structured method to prioritise combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) in naïve patients. Recommendations strength (A, B, C) and the evidence which supports them (I, II, III) are based on a modification of the Infectious Diseases Society of America criteria. The current antiretroviral treatment (ART) of choice for chronic HIV infection is the combination of three drugs. ART is recommended in patients with symptomatic HIV infection, in pregnancy, in serodiscordant couples with high transmission risk, hepatitis B fulfilling treatment criteria, and HIV nephropathy. Guidelines on ART treatment in patients with concurrent diagnosis of HIV infection and an opportunistic type C infection are included. In asymptomatic patients ART is recommended on the basis of CD4 lymphocyte counts, plasma viral load and patient co-morbidities, as follows: 1) therapy should be started in patients with CD4 counts <350 cells/μL; 2) when CD4 counts are between 350 and 500 cells/μL, therapy will be recommended and only delayed if patient is reluctant to take it, the CD4 are stabilised, and the plasma viral load is low; 3) therapy could be deferred when CD4 counts are above 500 cells/μL, but should be considered in cases of cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C, high cardiovascular risk, plasma viral load >10(5) copies/mL, proportion of CD4 cells <14%, and in people aged >55 years. ART should include 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors nucleoside analogues and a third drug (non-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor or integrase inhibitor). The panel has consensually selected and given priority to using the Gesida score for some drug combinations, some of them co-formulated. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable viral load. Adherence to therapy plays an essential role in maintaining antiviral response. Therapeutic options are limited after ART failures, but an undetectable viral load may be possible nowadays. Adverse events are a fading problem of ART. Guidelines in acute HIV infection, in women, in pregnancy, and to prevent mother-to-child transmission and pre- and post-exposition prophylaxis are commented upon. Management of hepatitis B or C co-infection, other co-morbidities, and the characteristics of ART in HIV-2 infection are included."
619,0.007,7.0000,"The introduction of enfuvirtide (FUZEON) represents an important advance in the treatment of therapy-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection. However, parenteral self-administration, and the advanced disease and antiretroviral experience of patients currently most needing enfuvirtide introduce unique usage considerations. Enfuvirtide has been shown to provide clinically relevant improvements in CD4 cell counts and reductions in HIV viraemia across all subgroups of treatment-experienced patients studied, including those taking few or no other active drugs. However, optimal outcome results from initiation when the CD4 cell count is above 100 x 10(6) cells/l and viraemia below 1 x 10(5) copies/ml, as part of a newly constructed third or fourth antiretroviral regimen in combination with one or two other antiretrovirals to which the virus remains sensitive. Resistance testing should be used where available to guide background drug selection. Where insufficient options for an effective background exist, enfuvirtide should still be considered and treatment undertaken with the aim of achieving an immunological or clinical response, despite the unlikelihood of a sustained virological outcome. Similarly, where there is no viable alternative treatment, enfuvirtide should be continued following virological failure wherever ongoing immunological or clinical benefit is discerned. Injection site reactions (ISRs) are common on enfuvirtide and will affect almost all patients. ISRs are manageable and seldom activity- or treatment-limiting. Bacterial pneumonia and systemic hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported uncommonly. A structured series of patient visits with a healthcare professional provides an atmosphere of ongoing training and support that may prevent 'injection fatigue', maintain adherence and minimise the incidence of ISRs. An initial investment in establishing such procedures can be expected to yield significant returns in patient confidence and benefit on enfuvirtide."
7661,0.007,7.0000,"The availability of an increasing number of antiretroviral agents and the rapid evolution of new information have introduced substantial complexity into treatment regimens for persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation convened the Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV to develop guidelines for clinical management of HIV-infected adults and adolescents (CDC. Report of the NIH Panel To Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection and Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected adults and adolescents. MMWR. 1998;47[RR-5]:1-41). This report, which updates the 1998 guidelines, addresses 1) using testing for plasma HIV ribonucleic acid levels (i.e., viral load) and CD4+ T cell count; 2) using testing for antiretroviral drug resistance; 3) considerations for when to initiate therapy; 4) adherence to antiretroviral therapy; 5) considerations for therapy among patients with advanced disease; 6) therapy-related adverse events; 7) interruption of therapy; 8) considerations for changing therapy and available therapeutic options; 9) treatment for acute HIV infection; 10) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among adolescents; 11) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among pregnant women; and 12) concerns related to transmission of HIV to others. Antiretroviral regimens are complex, have serious side effects, pose difficulty with adherence, and carry serious potential consequences from the development of viral resistance because of nonadherence to the drug regimen or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents. Patient education and involvement in therapeutic decisions are critical. Treatment should usually be offered to all patients with symptoms ascribed to HIV infection. Recommendations for offering antiretroviral therapy among asymptomatic patients require analysis of real and potential risks and benefits. In general, treatment should be offered to persons who have <350 CD4+ T cells/mm3 or plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels of >55,000 copies/mL (by b-deoxyribonucleic acid [bDNA] or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] assays). The recommendation to treat asymptomatic patients should be based on the willingness and readiness of the person to begin therapy; the degree of existing immunodeficiency as determined by the CD4+ T cell count; the risk for disease progression as determined by the CD4+ T cell count and level of plasma HIV RNA; the potential benefits and risks of initiating therapy in an asymptomatic person; and the likelihood, after counseling and education, of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. Treatment goals should be maximal and durable suppression of viral load, restoration and preservation of immunologic function, improvement of quality of life, and reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Results of therapy are evaluated through plasma HIV RNA levels, which are expected to indicate a 1.0 log10 decrease at 2-8 weeks and no detectable virus (<50 copies/mL) at 4-6 months after treatment initiation. Failure of therapy at 4-6 months might be ascribed to nonadherence, inadequate potency of drugs or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents, viral resistance, and other factors that are poorly understood. Patients whose therapy fails in spite of a high level of adherence to the regimen should have their regimen changed; this change should be guided by a thorough drug treatment history and the results of drug-resistance testing. Because of limitations in the available alternative antiretroviral regimens that have documented efficacy, optimal changes in therapy might be difficult to achieve for patients in whom the preferred regimen has failed. These decisions are further confounded by problems with adherence, toxicity, and resistance. For certain patients, participating in a clinical trial with or without access to new drugs or using a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replicatioing a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replication might be preferable. Because concepts regarding HIV management are evolving rapidly, readers should check regularly for additional information and updates at the HIV/AIDS Treatment Information Service website ( http://www.hivatis.org )."
9794,0.007,7.0000,"Viral liver diseases are frequent comorbidities and major contributors to death in HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Although cure of hepatitis C and control of hepatitis B with antivirals avert liver disease progression in most HIV-coinfected patients, the lack of satisfactory treatment for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection remains a major threat for developing cirrhosis and liver cancer in this population. In the European Union (EU) and North America, sexual contact has replaced injection drug use that has been the major transmission route for HDV in HIV-positive persons. PegIFNα is the only approved HDV therapy; however, sustained HDV-RNA clearance is achieved by less than 25%. The recent discovery of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide as the key hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV cell entry receptor has opened the door to a new therapeutic era. Indeed, promising results have been released using Myrcludex-B, a sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide inhibitor. More encouraging are data with new classes of HDV blockers, such as prenylation inhibitors (i.e. lonafarnib) and nucleic acid polymers. At this time, sustained suppression of HDV replication is the primary goal of HDV therapy, as it is associated with normalization of liver enzymes and histological improvement. Of note, the use of specific antivirals for HDV must be given along with anti-HBV agents to prevent HBV rebounds following removal of viral interference. The lack of persistent forms of HDV-RNA could provide a unique opportunity for curing hepatitis delta, even without eliminating HBV circular covalently closed DNA. Ultimately, suppression of HDV replication along with hepatitis B surface antigen clearance once drugs are off would be the best reflect of hepatitis delta cure."
1917,0.007,7.0000,"HIV-seropositive, active injection-drug users (IDUs), compared with other HIV populations, continue to have low rates of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use, contributing to disparities in their HIV health outcomes. We sought to identify individual-level, interpersonal, and structural factors associated with HAART use among active IDUs to inform comprehensive, contextually tailored intervention to improve the HAART use of IDUs. Prospective data from three semiannual assessments were combined, and logistic general estimating equations were used to identify variables associated with taking HAART 6 months later. Participants were a community sample of HIV-seropositive, active IDUs enrolled in the INSPIRE study, a U.S. multisite (Baltimore, Miami, New York, San Francisco) prevention intervention. The analytic sample included 1,225 observations, and comprised 62% males, 75% active drug users, 75% non-Hispanic blacks, and 55% with a CD4 count <350; 48% reported HAART use. Adjusted analyses indicated that the later HAART use of IDUs was independently predicted by patient-provider engagement, stable housing, medical coverage, and more HIV primary care visits. Significant individual factors included not currently using drugs and a positive attitude about HAART benefits even if using illicit drugs. Those who reported patient-centered interactions with their HIV primary care provider had a 45% greater odds of later HAART use, and those with stable housing had twofold greater odds. These findings suggest that interventions to improve the HIV treatment of IDUs and to reduce their HIV health disparities should be comprehensive, promoting better patient-provider engagement, stable housing, HAART education with regard to illicit drug use, and integration of drug-abuse treatment with HIV primary care."
5219,0.007,7.0000,"Important progress has been made in recent years in the development and clinical use of drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Nevertheless, when antiretroviral therapy fails to be fully suppressive, new viral variants emerge, thus allowing HIV-1 to escape from drug pressure by accumulating mutations. Between 50% and 70% of treated patients with virological rebound harbour some form of drug-resistant virus; transmitted drug resistance in drug-naïve populations has reached 5-20% in areas of the world with access to treatment. The emergence of drug-resistant viruses remains the limiting factor in HIV-1 management, being a major cause of treatment failure, and being associated with clinical progression and death. All international guidelines focus on the importance of tailoring antiretroviral therapy to the individual patient, on the basis onf HIV-1 genetic data, integrated with clinical, laboratory and therapeutic information. The aim of this review is to provide useful information to clinicians and virologists about how and when to use genotypic resistance testing in clinical practice, especially in the management of the first stages of HIV-1 patient care and treatment decisions."
7203,0.007,7.0000,"Injecting drug users (IDUs) are at high risk for infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne pathogens. In the United States, IDUs account for nearly one-third of the cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), either directly or indirectly (heterosexual and perinatal cases of AIDS where the source of infection was an IDU). IDU also account for a substantial proportion of cases of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus infections. The primary mode of transmission of HIV among IDUs is parenteral, through direct needle sharing or multiperson use of syringes. Despite high levels of knowledge about risk, multiperson use of needles and syringes is due primarily to fear of arrest and incarceration for violation of drug paraphernalia laws and ordinances that prohibit manufacture, sale, distribution, or possession of equipment and materials intended to be used with narcotics. It is estimated that in 1997 there were approximately 110 needle exchange programs (NEPs) in North America. In part, because of the ban on the use of Federal funds for the operation of needle exchange, it has been difficult to evaluate the efficacy of these programs. This chapter presents data from the studies that have evaluated the role of NEPs in HIV prevention. Evidence for the efficacy of NEPs comes from three source: (1) studies originally focused on the effectiveness of NEPs in non-HIV blood-borne infections, (2) mathematical modeling of data on needle exchange on HIV seroincidence, and (3) studies that examine the positive and negative impact of NEPs on HIV and AIDS. Case-control studies have provided powerful data on the positive effect of NEPs on reduction of two blood-borne viral infections (HBV and HCV) For example, a case-control study in Tacoma, Washington, showed that a six-fold increase in HBV and a seven-fold increase in HCV infections in IDUs were associated with nonuse of the NEP. The first federally funded study of needle exchange was an evaluation of the New Haven NEP, which is legally operated by the New Haven Health Department. Rather than relying on self-report of reduced risky injection drug use, this study utilized mathematical and statistical modeling, using data from a syringe tracking and testing system. Incidence of HIV infection among needle exchange participants was estimated to have decreased by 33% as a result of the NEP. A series of Government-commissioned reports have reviewed the data on positive and negative outcomes of NEPs. The major reports are from the National Commission on AIDS; the U.S. General Accounting Office; the Centers for Disease Control/University of California; and the National Academy of Sciences. The latter two reports are used in this chapter. The aggregated results support the positive benefit of NEPs and do not support negative outcomes from NEPs. When legal restrictions on both purchase and possession of syringes are removed, IDUs will change their syringe-sharing behaviors in ways that can reduce HIV transmission. NEPs do not result in increased drug use among participants or the recruitment of first-time drug users."
2298,0.006,6.0000,"Alcohol use may have a negative impact on the course of HIV disease and the effectiveness of its treatment. We studied patients with HIV who use alcohol and associated socio-demographic, health and psychosocial factors. Outcomes from this study may help in selecting patients from clinical practice with high-risk alcohol use and who are likely to benefit most from alcohol reduction interventions. In a cross sectional study in three primary health care clinics in Pretoria, South Africa, from January 2012 to June 2012, patients with HIV infection were interviewed and patients' medical files were reviewed to obtain data on levels of alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test), patients' socio-demographic characteristics, HIV-related information, health related quality of life (WHOQoL-HIVBref), internalized AIDS stigma, symptoms of depression and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Analyses consisted of descriptive statistics, bi- and multivariate logistic regression models. A total of 2230 patients (1483 [66.5%] female) were included. The median age was 37 years (interquartile range 31-43), 99.5% were black Africans, 1975 (88.6%) had started ART and the median time on ART was 22 months (interquartile range 9-40). No alcohol was used by 64% of patients, 8.9% were low risk drinkers, 25.1% of patients were hazardous or harmful drinkers and 2.0% had possible alcohol dependence. In multivariate analysis high-risk drinking was positively associated with male gender, never being married, tobacco use, a higher score for the 'level of independence'-domain measured with the WHOQoL-HIVBref questionnaire, and with more depressive symptoms compared to low-risk drinking. This study shows a high prevalence of hazardous or harmful drinking in patients with HIV infection (especially men) attending primary health care clinics in South Africa. Routine screening for alcohol use should be introduced in these clinics and harm reduction interventions should be evaluated, taking into account associated factors."
7107,0.006,6.0000,"Development of drug resistance is the inevitable consequence of incomplete suppression of virus plasma levels in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy. Resistance mutations previously characterized have been found in B subtype viruses of developed countries. Moreover, mutation profiles for non-B and more divergent B subtype viruses found in developing countries shall be analyzed together with their ex vivo phenotyping in order to establish an exact correlation between the genotyping data and the clinical management counseling for those uncommon virus subtypes. In the present study, we evaluated the mutation profile for individuals infected with B subtype and non-B subtype viruses. Viral DNA fragments corresponding to the RT gene were amplified, sequenced, and subtyped. Phenotyping analysis for reverse transcriptase nucleoside (NRTI) and nonnucleoside inhibitor susceptibility was performed using the recombinant virus assay technology. Brazilian non-B subtypes (subtype F, n = 4, and subtype A, n = 1) isolates showed essentially the same B subtype mutation profile, presenting an NRTI drug resistance with similar MIC50% and MIC90% values for all drugs analyzed regardless of their subtypes. A strong cross-resistance phenotype among AZT, 3TC, and abacavir could be seen in all isolates analyzed. A novel result was that some RT sequences not only revealed the presence of G333D/E mutations but also correlated to the presence of mutation T386I that could abrogate the M184V-surpassing effect of L210W or L210W plus G333D/E. These findings suggest that Brazilian non-B subtype HIV-1 strains use an identical RT drug resistance mutation pattern when compared to B isolates and will contribute to the validation of the genotypic and phenotypic tests in these predominant worldwide-spread viral variants."
6351,0.006,6.0000,"The intersection and syndemic interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics have global prevalence with devastating morbidity and massive mortality. Using FDG-PET imaging it was shown that in HIV-infected individuals, involvement of the head and neck precedes that of the chest and of the abdomen. The sequence of lymph node involvement observed suggests the existence of a diffusible activation mediator that may be targeted via therapeutic intervention strategies. Furthermore, the degree of FDG uptake proved directly related to viral load and inversely related to CD4 cell count. Available data in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining cancers further suggest that FDG-PET/CT imaging may be useful for prognostication of cervical cancer and for identifying appropriate sites for biopsy, staging, and monitoring lymphoproliferative activity owing to HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma and multicentric Castleman disease. Inversely, in HIV-associated lymphoma, FDG uptake in HIV-involved lymphoid tissue was shown to reduce the specificity of FDG-PET imaging findings, the effect of which in clinical practice warrants further investigation. In the latter setting, knowledge of viremia appears to be essential for FDG-PET image interpretation. Early HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, formerly known as AIDS dementia complex, proved to be characterized by striatal hypermetabolism and progressive HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder or AIDS dementia complex by a decrease in subcortical and cortical metabolism. In lipodystrophic HIV-infected individuals, lipodystrophy proved associated with increased glucose uptake by adipose tissue, likely resulting from the metabolic stress of adipose tissue in response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Furthermore, ongoing chronic low-grade infection in arteries of HIV-infected individuals could be depicted by FDG-PET/CT imaging. And there is promising data that FDG-PET/CT in HIV may serve as a new marker for the evaluation of thymic function in HIV-infected patients. In the setting of TB, FDG-PET has proven unable to differentiate malignancy from TB in patients presenting with solitary pulmonary nodules, including those suffering from HIV, and thus cannot be used as a tool to reduce futile biopsy or thoracotomy in these patients. In patients presenting with extrapulmonary TB, FDG-PET imaging was found to be significantly more efficient when compared with CT for the identification of more sites of involvement. Thus supporting that FDG-PET/CT can demonstrate lesion extent, serve as guide for biopsy with aspiration for culture, assist surgery planning and contribute to follow-up. Limited available data suggest that quantitative FDG-PET findings may allow for prediction or rapid assessment, at 4 months following treatment instigation, of response to antituberculostatics in TB-infected HIV patients. These results and more recent findings suggest a role for FDG-PET/CT imaging in the evaluation of therapeutic response in TB patients. "
2709,0.006,6.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B affects nearly 10% of HIV-infected patients. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a dynamic disease and coinfection with HIV impacts directly on the outcome of HBV infection, considerably complicating its natural history, diagnosis, and management. The aim of this study was to compare two cohorts of HBV monoinfected and HBV/HIV coinfected Iranian patients undergoing long-term lamivudine therapy from the clinical and virological aspects, as well as the frequency of detected mutations in HBV genome. To this end, HBV Pol/S regions from 72 patients were PCR-amplified and directly sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a 40-times higher risk of coinfection with ayw3 subtype of HBV genotype D rather than ayw2 subtype [P<0.001, odd: 40.66, CI: 95 % (4.69-352.23)]. While no resistance mutation was detected in HBV/HIV coinfected cohort, LAM-resistance mutations (rtM204I/V in YMDD and rtL180M in FLLA polymerase motifs) were identified in 30% (9 out of 30) and 16.66% (5 out of 30) of HBV monoinfected patients (P<0.05). Moreover, several mutations (sP105A, sI110S/L, sS136Y and sP127T/L) with significant differences in the frequency were identified in the S region of both cohorts. Finally, this study found strong correlation between the type of infection (mono or coinfection) and characteristics like patient gender, ALT levels, HBV-DNA levels and HBV subtypes. These results pointed to the importance of determination of HBV variants in the management of patients and suggested that in contrary to HBV monoinfections, LAM may be still an appropriate drug for the treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV coinfected patients; however, further studies to clarify the role of HIV in HBV LAM-resistance mutations are required."
8572,0.006,6.0000,"HIV infection is the major public health, social and economic problem in Georgia. The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of ARV treatment system in Georgia. Study included 1052 people living with HIV/AIDS in Georgia registered at Infectious Disease, AIDS and Clinical Immunology Research Center since 2004. To ensure universal access to ARV therapy all HIV/AIDS individuals included in the study were investigated by special algorithm, all identified patients requiring ARV therapy were offered treatment and monitored during therapy on treatment effectiveness and side effects. Detection of HIV antibodies was performed by ELISA with further confirmation by Western Blot Assay. HIV-1 RNA in plasma was measured by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction. For determination of percentages and absolute count of T lymphocyte subpopulations single-platform immunophenotyping technique using the Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer was applied. For resistance testing TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit with the OpenGene DNA Sequencing System (Siemens) was used. Treatment was offered to 595 HIV/AIDS patients. 594 patients started treatment, 1 patient refused. Out of treated 594 HIV/AIDS patients 22 patients discontinued, 111 patients died and 461 patients are currently on ARV treatment. Out of treated patients 406 adults and 21 children are receiving first-line treatment, 31 adults and 2 children are on second-line treatment and 1 adult is receiving salvage regimen. Treatment failure was defined in 55 cases. Among them immunological failure was observed in 7 cases, clinical failure in 1 case and virologic failure in 47 cases. Prevalence of drug resistance among virologic failure cases accounted for 72% and inadequate adherence for 28% cases. Majority of death cases among ARV treated patients was due to non-AIDS related or incurable conditions, while deaths due to AIDS related conditions mainly were associated to the delayed referral of patients in already advanced stage of disease. It's worth to mention that highest number of death cases was due to liver failure in HIV/HCV and/or HBV co-infected patients."
4726,0.006,6.0000,"The number of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is gradually increasing in Japan, and the morbidity rate from tuberculosis in the Japanese people is high. Accordingly, the number of cases with both infections is considered to increase in the future. Our hospital has already encountered 31 cases of HIV associated tuberculosis. HIV infects mainly CD4-positive cells. The extreme decrease in the cell count results in serious cellular immunological disorder. CD4-positive cell disorder induces disorders of B lymphocytes, cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophage functions. These destructive conditions show the state of immunodeficiency including macrophage that are most important for defense of acid-fast bacterial infection. Migration and activation of macrophages with cytokines derived from T cells are impaired to induce the following phenomena: hypoplasia of granuloma, failure of tubercule bacillus suppression, the spread to regional lymph nodes (hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes), and hematogenous dissemination. On this occasion, caseous necrosis and cavitation are unlikely to occur, and false-negative tuberculin reaction is often observed. The incidence of severe cases, which include miliary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, etc., and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, are high among acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated tuberculosis cases. HIV-infected tuberculosis cases are generally regarded as endogenous exacerbation, but they include primary infection and reinfection as well. Even during the treatment for drug-sensitive strains particularly, some cases may have reinfection with multidrug-resistant bacteria, suggesting that caution should be taken against this point. Conversely, the association of tuberculosis is a factor for the poor prognosis of HIV infection, since it facilitates the development of HIV infection. If the bacteria belong to a drug-sensitive strain, the infection with them responds well to antituberculous drugs, the same as in tuberculosis cases without HIV infection, showing a favorable prognosis. However, the mortality rate of infection with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis is extremely high. The combined use of a protease inhibitor, i.e., anti-HIV drug, with rifampicin is regarded as contraindication for the treatment because rifampicin strongly induces hepatic cytochrome P-450 and increases the metabolism of protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptases to markedly decrease the blood concentrations. Accordingly, the treatment for tuberculosis should take priority over that for HIV infection in HIV-infected tuberculosis, and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may be administered after the treatment of tuberculosis. When HAART is necessary for the treatment during the tuberculosis treatment, rifampicin had better be exchanged to rifabutin because the effect of rifabutin to induce cytochrome P-450 is less potent than that of rifampicin. A report has recently shown that the exacerbation of pyrexia and chest X-ray findings was transiently observed approximately 2 weeks after potent anti-HIV therapy for HIV-infected tuberculosis, which included a protease inhibitor. The reason for the exacerbation has been believed to be that the impaired function of CD4-positive cells is improved by the administration of anti-HIV drugs to raise temporarily the reaction of the vital part to M. tuberculosis. A tuberculin skin test (TST) reaction size of > or = 5 mm of induration is considered positive (i.e., indicative of M. tuberculosis infection) in persons who are infected with HIV. Persons with a TST reaction size > or = 5 mm who have not previously received treatment for M. tuberculosis infection should receive tuberculosis preventive treatment. Prevention by BCG vaccination is regarded as contraindications for HIV-infected patients, because disseminated M. bovis infection may be associated with them. Many HIV-positive patients infected with tuberculosis show uneventful healing, when M. tuberculosis is the sensitive strain. However, since some patients show the rapid course of tuberculosis, clinical physicians keep the early detection of tuberculosis for HIV-infected patients and the association of HIV infection for tuberculosis patients in their mind, respectively."

We analyzed data from the N2R study which was an open label, randomized, comparative trial comparing treatment outcomes between 71 TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients receiving efavirenz (EFV)-based and nevirapine (NVP)-based ART; all of whom were receiving RMP-containing anti-TB treatment. Demographic data, liver function test, CD4 cell count, plasma HIV-1 RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody were collected before initiating ART (week 0). Liver enzymes and total bilirubin levels were monitored at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after ART initiation. All patients were followed until TB therapy was completed. Of 142 patients, 8 patients were excluded. Among the remaining 134 patients, the mean+/-SD age was 36.8+/-8.6 years and 67.2% were male. Severe hepatotoxicity (grade 3 or 4) developed in 4 patients (2.9%); 3 patients (4.6%) in the NVP group and 1 patient (1.4%) in the EFV group. Severe hyperbilirubinemia (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 7 patients (5.2%); 5 patients (7.7%) in the NVP group and 2 patients (2.9%) in the EFV group. Grade 1 or 2 hepatotoxicity occurred in 34 patients (31.4%). Hepatitis C virus co-infection (adjusted OR 3.03; 95%CI 1.26-7.29) was an independent risk factor associated with grade 1-4 hepatotoxicity (p=0.013). Monitoring of hepatotoxicity should be considered in TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients who are infected with HCV and receiving NVP."
2120,0.006,6.0000,"Mutations in the precore region of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been associated with failure of expression of HBV e-antigen (HBeAg), however, the prevalence of these and other mutations in HBV carriers without overt chronic liver disease remains uncertain. Homosexual or bisexual males (n = 65) with chronic HBV infection attending The Middlesex Hospital, London were studied, of whom two had clinical evidence of chronic liver disease. HBV DNA was amplified from 62 of 65 serum samples using nested and double nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Direct sequencing of the PCR products was employed to investigate sequence variation. HBV-DNA from all available HBeAg-negative (n = 9) and selected HBeAg-positive (n = 33) sera were sequenced in the entire precore gene, the 3' terminal portion of the X gene (aa128-154), and the 5' terminus of the core gene (aa18-73). Sequences were highly conserved in all regions studied. Samples from two anti-HBe-seropositive patients contained mutations in the precore region. In one, a single mutation in the first amino acid resulted in a change to leucine, which would prevent translation of this region and therefore HBeAg expression. Wild type sequences were also detected in this sample. In the other sample from a patient with overt chronic liver disease, a mutation of precore amino acid 28 changed a tryptophan residue to a stop codon which would also prevent HBeAg expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5770,0.005,5.0000,"The first HIV-infected patients were treated in 1986, however, at that time medicines inhibiting HIV replication were not available. Solely the complications of AIDS and opportunistic infections could be treated. The HIV replication inhibition capacity of antiretroviral nucleoside and ribavirin were tested in Hungary in 1987, an early date even in international practice. The first nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), azidothymidine, presently called zidovudine (ZDV), was introduced in 1989. By giving patients the appropriate dosage of this, the progression of the disease could be delayed by approximately 6 months to one year. In 1991, the application of two new NRTI was commenced, namely zalcitabine (DDC) and didanosine (DDI). These medicines were applied partly in case of ZDV intolerance and as a part of the sequential monotherapy. In 1994 and 1995 two new NRTI's were introduce, namely stavudine (d4T) and lamivudine (3 TC). At that same time, to obtain a more effective replication inhibition method, a double NRTI combination became part of the therapeutic protocol. The year 1996 resulted in significant changes. At the beginning of the year, two compounds belonging to two new therapeutic procedures. These are saquinavir (SQV) and delavirdine (DLV) belonging to the groups of protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase, respectively. The so-called virus cocktails and the effective active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were applied and, later, to monitor the efficiency of the treatment, the opportunity was provided to measure the copy number of HIV-RNS. The treatment of the HIV disease entails a number of unanswered questions. The maximum result that can be achieved by using today's therapeutic methods is to prolong that particular phase of the HIV disease, which secures the patient a fairly good quality of life. The new combination of the antiretroviral compounds produced by the pharmaceutical industry provides better changes to prolong said period by years, sometimes decades. However, the real solutions to the problem are only theoretically known treatment procedures (gene therapy, cytokins) today."
7913,0.005,5.0000,"The availability of 24 antiretroviral (ARV) drugs within six distinct drug classes has transformed HIV-1 infection (AIDS) into a treatable chronic disease. However, the ability of HIV-1 to develop resistance to multiple classes continues to present challenges to the treatment of many ARV treatment-experienced patients. In this case report, we describe the response to ibalizumab, an investigational CD4-binding monoclonal antibody (mAb), in a patient with advanced immunodeficiency and high-level five-class antiretroviral resistance. After starting an ibalizumab-based salvage regimen, the patient had an approximately 4.0 log(10) reduction in viral load. An inadvertently missed infusion at week 32 led to the rapid loss of virologic response and decreased susceptibility to the remainder of the patient's salvage therapy regimen. Following the reinstitution of ibalizumab, phenotypic and genotypic resistance to ibalizumab was detected. Nonetheless, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels stabilized at ∼2.0 log(10) copies/ml below pre-ibalizumab levels. Continued ARV drug development may yield additional clinical and public health benefits. This report illustrates the promise of mAbs for HIV-1 therapy in highly treatment-experienced patients. Therapeutic mAbs may also have a role in pre-exposure prophylaxis in high-risk uninfected populations and may facilitate directly observed therapy (DOT) if two or more synergistic long acting agents become available."
4015,0.005,5.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant worldwide health care problem. Nearly one-third of all patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are coinfected with HCV. Compared with HIV-monoinfected persons, coinfected individuals experience more rapid progression of fibrosis and higher incidence of cirrhosis and death as a result of liver disease. Treatment for HCV infection includes ribavirin (RBV) plus interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) or pegylated IFN, a combination treatment associated with anemia that may require RBV dose reduction or discontinuation. IFN-RBV-associated anemia is more profound among coinfected patients, who have a high prevalence of pretreatment anemia and may also be taking other medications causing anemia. Epoetin alfa administration to HCV-infected patients with IFN-RBV-related anemia can significantly increase hemoglobin levels and maintain significantly higher RBV doses compared with patients treated with RBV dose reduction alone. Higher RBV doses and adherence to HCV therapy have been associated with higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates. Maintenance of RBV dose with epoetin alfa may improve adherence, thereby affecting SVR."
9724,0.005,5.0000,"There is limited knowledge about how to treat and interpret results from genotypic resistance assays in HIV-2 infection. Here, genetic variation in HIV-2 pol gene was studied in 20 of 23 known HIV-2 cases in Sweden. Five patients with signs of virological treatment failure were longitudinally studied. Clinical, virological and immunological data were collected and the protease (PR) and first half of the reverse transcriptase (RT) was amplified and directly sequenced from plasma samples. Moderate to extensive genetic evolution was observed in four of the five patients who failed treatment. Some mutations occurred at positions known to confer resistance in HIV-1, but many occurred at other positions in PR and RT. All patients had been treated with zidovudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, but none displayed a mutation at position 215, which is the primary zidovudine resistance site in HIV-1. Instead, a E219D mutation evolved in virus from two patients and a Q151M mutation evolved in two other patients. A M184V mutation indicative of lamivudine resistance was detected in three patients. The virus of one patient who had been treated with ritonavir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir successively acquired nine unusual mutations in the protease gene, most of which are not considered primary or secondary resistance mutations in HIV-1. Our data indicate that the evolutionary pathways that lead to antiretroviral resistance in HIV-2 and HIV-1 exhibit both similarities and differences. Genotypic HIV-2 resistance assays cannot be interpreted using algorithms developed for HIV-1, instead new algorithms specific for HIV-2 have to be developed."
1444,0.005,5.0000,"The novel 2'-deoxyguanosine analog Entecavir (ETV) is a potent inhibitor of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and is recommended for treatment in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HBV-co-infected patients because it had been reported that ETV is HBV-specific. Recent clinical observations, however, have suggested that ETV may indeed demonstrate anti-HIV-1 activity. To investigate this question at a molecular level, kinetic studies were used to examine the interaction of 5'-triphosphate form of ETV with wild type (WT) HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant mutation M184V. Using single turnover kinetic assays, we found that HIV-1 WT RT and M184V RT could use the activated ETV triphosphate metabolite as a substrate for incorporation. The mutant displayed a slower incorporation rate, a lower binding affinity, and a lower incorporation efficiency with the 5'-triphosphate form of ETV compared with WT RT, suggesting a kinetic basis for resistance. Our results are supported by cell-based assays in primary human lymphocytes that show inhibition of WT HIV-1 replication by ETV and decreased susceptibility of the HIV-1 containing the M184V mutation. This study has important therapeutic implications as it establishes ETV as an inhibitor for HIV-1 RT and illustrates the mechanism of resistance by the M184V mutant."
8461,0.005,5.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B is widespread and represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality due to the evolution to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This study was designed to improve the national laboratory surveillance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, focusing on genomic analysis of isolates from Romanian patients. Sera from ten patients with HBV were collected and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on a DNA fragment spanning almost the entire genome. The occurrence of mutations was assessed for each open reading frame in the viral genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five isolates belonging to genotype A (subgenotype A2) and other five clustering with genotype D strains (subgenotype D1). Two patients treated with lamivudine were found to carry isolates harboring rtM204V lamivudine resistance mutation. An HBV isolate displaying a lamivudine complex resistance pattern, rtM204I in conjunction with rtL180M and rtA200V, was found in a lamivudine naïve patient. All samples harbored sA105P substitution, usually found in HBIg therapy escape isolates. Three of the studied strains were simultaneously displaying T1753, T1762 and A1764 mutations which in vitro induce enhanced genome replication and reduction of HBeAg expression. The sequence obtained from a patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis presents a novel type of insertion consisting of nine nucleotides between positions 260 and 261 in the X gene. Despite the small number of samples, our findings suggest the need to determine the drug resistance pattern for each patient before taking a therapeutic decision and also highlight the necessity of knowing the real level of drug resistance among HBV strains circulating in Romania."
9242,0.005,5.0000,"Antiretroviral medications are effective at improving the health and increasing the survival of people living with HIV/AIDS. However, studies have shown that a substantial number of HIV-infected people do not receive antiretroviral treatments. The current study examined the physical and mental health, substance use, and perceptions of medical care of 163 men and 78 women living with HIV/AIDS. Results of a confidential survey showed that 79 (33%) were not currently treated for HIV. These persons did not differ from those who were treated in chart-abstracted CD4 cell counts, years living with HIV infection, HIV-related symptoms, and HIV-related hospitalizations. Unlike past studies, gender was not found to be a factor in treatment status. However, untreated persons had higher chart-abstracted viral loads and were more likely to be ethnic minorities, have a lower level of education, greater level of depression, and greater pessimistic attitude. They were significantly more likely to have used alcohol, powder cocaine, and crack cocaine in the previous 3 months, were likely to know their own viral load and CD4 count, and held significantly more negative views of their health care and their health care providers. There were no differences between untreated and treated persons in their meeting the year 1999 antiretroviral treatment guidelines that were in effect at the time of data collection. These results suggest that persons who are not receiving antiretroviral medications may be in need of mental health and substance use interventions and may benefit from interventions designed to engage and retain them in medical treatment."
7321,0.005,5.0000,"Incidence of brain infections in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive patients is reduced after the availability of current high active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2) is an infrequent cause of encephalitis in HIV patients despite it is frequently involved in sexual transmitted infections. Here, we report a case of HSV-2 encephalitis occurring in a patient without full suppression of HIV replication within the brain. A 38 year-old HIV infected man was admitted to our department because of recurrent generalized seizure and fever during the previous 24 hours. Eight months before our observation the patient was switched from a protease inhibitor based regimen to a rilpivirine-based regimen without any evidence of HIV-RNA replication in the plasma. When the patient was admitted in our hospital, he was febrile and moderately confused, no deficit of cranial nerves was reported, motility was conserved, but he was unable to walk. Laboratory examinations performed at admission demonstrated an increase of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein and cells with lymphocyte prevalence, and normal CSF glucose. HSV-2-DNA and HIV-RNA were present within CSF at admission. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance imaging of the brain revealed lesions of the medial part of both temporal lobes including hippocampus without any sign of bleeding. A 21-day course of acyclovir therapy was administered with consistent improvement of clinical findings and disappearance of HSV-2-DNA within CSF. After the episode, HAART was switched to a regimen with high CSF penetrability containing abacavir, lamivudine, darunavir and ritonavir. Twelve months after HSV-2 encephalitis neurologic evaluation was normal, but symptoms of depression were reported, HIV-RNA remained undetectable both in the plasma and CSF, and CD4+ lymphocytes were above 500/μL. No opportunistic infection was reported. Patients switched to regimen well tolerated such those containing rilpivirine, that have poor drug concentration within CSF could be considered at risk for opportunistic infection of the brain. Further larger investigation needs to confirm this finding. "
4455,0.005,5.0000,"The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemic of clinically apparent human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) infection in Nicaragua and to discuss the reasons why the number of HIV patients presenting to the public health care system is increasing compared with other Central American countries. From 1987 to 2004, 1,614 HIV-positive patients were officially reported to the Nicaraguan STI/HIV/AIDS national program. Urban areas along the west-central and eastern part of Nicaragua showed the highest prevalence of AIDS, with a maximum of 54.2/year per 100,000 inhabitants. Most of the infections (91%) were acquired sexually: 65% by heterosexual contacts and 26% by homosexual contacts. The highest rate of infection was found in men aged between 20 to 39 years, with a peak around 35 to 39 years (annual incidence of 125.6 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants), and in women aged 20 to 34 years old, with a peak around 20 to 24 years (annual incidence 46.6 per 100,000 inhabitants). The male to female ratio of infection was 3:1. The death rate was stable until the beginning of 1999, but increased sharply thereafter up to 2004, the year that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced in Nicaragua. In 2005, we observed a further increase in the mortality. However, our data do not represent the magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a whole, due to a lack of systemic surveillance. HIV/AIDS in Nicaragua is in a nascent stage and is concentrated in high-risk populations, such as utility workers, commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, prisoners, street children, housewives and police and military forces. Education of the population is an urgent need to increase HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, change attitudes, and increase safer sex practice in the community."
5894,0.005,5.0000,"Approximately 1 million people are infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Malawi. Despite efforts aimed at changing individual risk behaviors, HIV prevalence continues to rise among rural populations. Both previous research and the Political Economy of Health framework suggest that community-based socio-economic factors and accessibility may influence HIV transmission; however, these community factors have received little empirical investigation. To fill this gap, this research uses data from a nationally representative probability sample of rural Malawians combined with small area estimates of community socio-economic and accessibility data in logistic regression models to: 1) reveal relationships between community factors and individual HIV status; 2) determine whether these relationships operate through individual HIV risk behaviors; and 3) explore whether these associations vary by gender. Community socio-economic factors include relative and absolute poverty; community accessibility factors include distance to roads, cities, and public health facilities. Individual HIV risk behaviors include reported condom use, sexually transmitted infections, multiple partnerships, and paid sex. Results show that higher community income inequality, community proximity to a major road, and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV for women. For men, community proximity to a major road and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV infection. These direct relationships between community factors and individual HIV status are not mediated by individual HIV risk behaviors. The Political Economy of Health frames the discussion. This study provides evidence for expanding HIV prevention efforts beyond individual risk behaviors to consideration of community factors that may drive the HIV epidemic in rural Malawi."
8350,0.005,5.0000,"Virologic failure, or the inability to maintain or achieve viral suppression below detectable limits (<50 copies/mL), occurs in some patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, despite being on a potent antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. Current guidelines state that the goal of therapy is to achieve and maintain HIV-1 RNA below detectable levels, with recommendations to switch regimens upon virologic failure based on the adverse consequences of higher degrees of viremia. With the introduction of potent, newer agents, the likelihood of achieving this goal in treatment-experienced patients is growing. Not all patients who experience virologic failure while on therapy suffer from immediate virologic and immunologic decline; some experience persistently low, but detectable, levels of HIV-1 RNA in the range of 50-1000 copies/mL. The threshold at which low-level viremia (LLV) becomes predictive of disease progression varies between studies, although evidence shows that incomplete viral suppression leads to the accumulation of resistance mutations with a concomitant increase in viral replication, reduction in CD4 cell counts, increased risk of virologic progression, and clinical deterioration. Furthermore, with increasing resistance, future treatment options are compromised. Although there are clinical consequences when a patient is maintained on a failing regimen, it may be preferable to delay a switch in therapy if the chance for resuppression is low. With the introduction of new ARVs within existing classes that have shown significant activity against resistant virus, as well as the introduction of two new classes of ARV agents, HIV treatment has entered a new era. The options for constructing regimens active against multidrug-resistant virus have expanded."
2074,0.005,5.0000,"In 1998 it seems reasonable and widely accepted that all human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients willing to be treated may benefit from receiving antiretroviral therapy. Only those with undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA, normal CD4 lymphocyte counts and lack of markers of immunological system activation may be possible exceptions. The rationale supporting the early initiation of antiretroviral therapy are (i) data on viral dynamics; (ii) preliminary data pointing toward a better and a quicker restoration of immune function when treatment is initiated in very early stages (during or within a few weeks or months of acute symptomatic or asymptomatic HIV-1 infection); (iii) the lack of a stable viral load set-point even in patients in the early stages (CD4 > 500 cells/mm3) who have a very low viral load (< 5000 copies/ml); (iv) the relatively high likelihood of clinical progression at mid-term of the approximately 50-75% of patients in very early disease stages (CD4 > 500 cells/mm3) who have a plasma viral load above 5000 to 10,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml; (v) data from the Spanish Earth-1 study, which used a composite endpoint (virological, immunological or clinical progression), demonstrating that even in these very early stages of HIV-1 disease any antiretroviral therapy (double or triple combination) was better than no treatment. Even in early disease stages, a triple combination is needed to achieve a durable and profound virological and immunological response. In addition, the combination of stavudine plus didanosine has several advantages and can be considered one of the best double nucleoside combinations to combine with a protease inhibitor or with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The INCAS study and the preliminary results of the ongoing Spanish SCAN study have demonstrated the possibility of protease inhibitor-sparing combinations for initial antiretroviral treatment, at least in selected patient subsets, such as those with a relatively low baseline viral load. Furthermore, components of these protease inhibitor-sparing combinations such as didanosine or nevirapine are suitable for once daily administration."
3186,0.005,5.0000,"During infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV), most patients develop mild or asymptomatic disease. However, a small number of patients develop serious, life-threatening hepatitis. We investigated this variability in disease severity by examining 30 Argentinean patients with HAV-induced acute liver failure in a case-control, cross-sectional, observational study. We found that HAV-induced severe liver disease was associated with a 6-amino-acid insertion in TIM1/HAVCR1 (157insMTTTVP), the gene encoding the HAV receptor. This polymorphism was previously shown to be associated with protection against asthma and allergic diseases and with HIV progression. In binding assays, the TIM-1 protein containing the 157insMTTTVP insertion polymorphism bound HAV more efficiently. When expressed by human natural killer T (NKT) cells, this long form resulted in greater NKT cell cytolytic activity against HAV-infected liver cells, compared with the shorter TIM-1 protein without the polymorphism. To our knowledge, the 157insMTTTVP polymorphism in TIM1 is the first genetic susceptibility factor shown to predispose to HAV-induced acute liver failure. Furthermore, these results suggest that HAV infection has driven the natural selection of shorter forms of the TIM-1 protein, which binds HAV less efficiently, thereby protecting against severe HAV-induced disease, but which may predispose toward inflammation associated with asthma and allergy."
9487,0.005,5.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is one of the most prominent health care challenges world wide. In Western industrialized countries where common access to antiretroviral drugs exists, HIV infection is a well treatable disease in the long-term for most patients. However, given the possible evolution of drug-resistance, the right combination of antiretroviral drugs in first-line therapy is crucial for maintaining long-term success. For each individual patient, the ideal time to start antiretroviral therapy must be carefully selected. The individual risk of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on the one hand, and the risks of long-term toxicity and adherence problems under therapy on the other hand must be taken into account. Each patient should be counseled according to present treatment guidelines on when and how to start HAART, taking into account the surrogate markers CD4-cell count and HIV-RNA as well as clinically apparent HIV-associated disease."
9951,0.005,5.0000,"A randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted to examine the impact of a semistructured, 10-week, once weekly, 90-min/session bereavement support group intervention on immunological, neuroendocrine, and clinical health status in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-seropositive (HIV-1+) and HIV-1-seronegative (HIV-1-) homosexual men, compared to a standard of care control condition. A total of 119 homosexual men (74 HIV-1+ and 45 HIV-1-) were assessed at baseline, 10 weeks, and 6 months follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up assessment, the intervention groups exhibited significant beneficial effects compared to controls on changes in CD4 cell, total T-lymphocyte, and total lymphocyte counts, when baseline levels, antiretroviral medication use, CDC stage of disease, and other potentially confounding factors were accounted for. There was no statistically significant effect on the CD4/CD8 ratio or on the CD8 cell count. The effect on CD4 cell count was associated with group attendance and with changes in plasma cortisol level. Plasma cortisol levels decreased significantly among intervention subjects, compared to controls. A significantly reduced number of health care visits over the 6-month follow-up period among the intervention subjects supported the clinical relevance of the immunological changes observed for both HIV-1+ and HIV-1- individuals. These results indicate that behavioral interventions may have salutary immunological and clinical health effects following bereavement among HIV-1-infected individuals. The effect in HIV-1- individuals suggests that this bereavement support group intervention might have similar salutary effects in the general population. Potential effects of such interventions on clinical HIV disease progression are of interest and should be studied."
6463,0.005,5.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapies potentially suppress HBV viral load to an undetectable level reducing the risk of progressive liver disease and the development of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Adherence to antiviral therapies is imperative to achieve and maintain viral suppression. To date, there has been limited research on adherence to HBV therapies. Our study aimed to explore factors influencing adherence to antiviral therapy. A total of 29 participants consented to in-depth qualitative interviews at three outpatient clinics in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were initially classified as adherent or nonadherent and thematic analysis was used to identify dominant themes. Adherent behavior was reported by 59% (n = 17) of participants. Several themes influenced adherence including routine, fear of HBV-related disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, and forgetfulness. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to explore adherence to HBV antiviral therapy. An interplay of several dominant themes emerged from our data including fear of chronic HBV disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, routine, and forgetfulness. Study findings have the potential to change nursing clinical practice, especially the way nurses and other clinicians target key HBV treatment messages and education, while monitoring adherence."
5380,0.005,5.0000,"Although zidovudine (ZDV) is effective in HIV-1-infected patients, the duration of its efficacy may be short when treatment is started in advanced HIV disease. This pilot prospective case-control study was designed to evaluate the combination of ZDV plus didanosine [ddI] compared with ZDV monotherapy as an initial therapeutic strategy. 'Control' patients (ZDV monotherapy) were matched with 'case' patients (ZDV plus ddI combination therapy) according to the presence or absence of AIDS-defining criteria at entry and CD4 cell count. The case patient group consisted of 35 consecutive HIV-1-infected individuals with < or = 300 CD4 cells/mm3, no previous experience of antiretroviral therapy and who accepted treatment with a combination of ZDV plus ddI. The control patient group consisted of 35 consecutive patients with similar characteristics, but who preferred to start treatment with ZDV alone. Control patients received 250 mg ZDV bid and case patients received ZDV at the same dose plus ddI (200 mg bid). Primary study endpoints were virological (serum HIV-1 RNA) and immunological (CD4 cell count) responses. Viral phenotype (syncytium-inducing (SI) or non-syncytium-inducing (NSI)), development of mutations at codons 215, 41 and 74 and clinical progression (new AIDS-defining event or death) were also assessed. Virological and CD4 cell count responses were significantly greater and more sustained in the group treated with ZDV plus ddI than in the control group, with peak responses of -1.2 +/- 0.7 log10 versus -0.3 +/- 0.4 log10 at 1 month (P = 0.0003) and 61 +/- 52 cells/mm3 versus 19 +/- 25 cells/mm3 at 2 months (P = 0.001), respectively. In both groups the percentage of patients developing a mutation at codon 215 was around 80 per cent at 12 months. A mutation at codon 74 was detected in 30 per cent of case patients at 12 months. Five case patients (14 per cent) versus 12 control patients (34 per cent) showed signs of clinical progression (P = 0.09). In a multivariate model, clinical progression was significantly associated with a baseline"
6426,0.005,5.0000,"Europe is currently observing a significant rise in non-B subtypes. Consequently, the effect of genetic variability on therapy response or genotypic resistance interpretation algorithms is an emerging concern. The purpose of this study is to investigate the amino acid substitutions selected under drug pressure in the protease of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes B and G, and determine if there are any significant differences. We investigated therapy-related and subtype-related substitutions in the protease, considering subtype, overall protease inhibitor treatment and individual drug exposure. Many mutations were significantly related to protease inhibitor (PI) therapy, with mutations exclusive to subtype B or subtype G. Some mutations are at positions related to resistance in both subtypes, but the amino acid substitution is different. Other mutations were significantly associated with subtype and PI selective pressure (p<0.05), pointing towards a differential selective pressure in both subtypes. We confirmed previous reports on the subtype-dependent selection of D30N and 89I, and identified a new mutation with such differential selective pressure: 37D was preferentially selected by lopinavir in subtype B. Other novel mutations found under therapy pressure were 13A, 35N, K55R, I66F, I72L/T, T74S, 82M and 89I/V. Our study indicates that even though in general, drug selective pressure and resistance pathways are relatively similar between subtypes B and G, some differences do occur, leading to subtype-dependent substitutions."
7187,0.005,5.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors has led to dramatic decrease in the morbidity and mortality resulting from infection with human immunodeficiency virus-1. However, this combination regimen can be associated with the occurrence of serious toxicities, which may reduce patient compliance. In particular, human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors and nevirapine among nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, have the potential for producing hepatotoxicity. We summarise current knowledge of the hepatotoxic effects associated with the commercially available human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors based on a literature review of the major retrospective and prospective clinical studies designed to elucidate risk factors for developing hepatotoxicity among human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy containing protease inhibitors. Coinfection with chronic hepatitis, a common occurrence in human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients, is identified as an independent risk factor for developing hepatotoxicity in antiretroviral-treated human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients treated with antiretroviral regimens containing protease inhibitors. The importance of other risk factors for developing protease inhibitor-associated hepatotoxicity and the mechanism underlying the drug-related hepatotoxicity are discussed. The data indicate that the potential for producing hepatotoxicity is variable among the protease inhibitors and suggest that based on differences in drug-related hepatotoxicity, certain protease inhibitors may be preferred for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus coinfected patients."
6126,0.004,4.0000,"Vaccination for hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the setting of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is recommended, but responses to vaccination are blunted when compared to uninfected populations. The mechanism for this failure of immune response in HCV-infected subjects remains unknown but is thought to be a result of lymphocyte dysfunction during chronic viral infection. We have recently demonstrated that PD-1, a novel negative immunomodulator for T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, is involved in T and B lymphocyte dysregulation during chronic HCV infection. In this report, we further investigated the role of the PD-1 pathway in regulation of CD4(+) T cell responses to HBV vaccination in HCV-infected individuals. In a prospective HCV infected cohort, a poor response rate to HBV vaccination as assayed by seroconversion was observed in HCV-infected subjects (53%), while a high response rate was observed in healthy or spontaneously HCV-resolved individuals (94%). CD4(+) T cell responses to ex vivo stimulations of anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were found to be lower in HBV vaccine non-responders compared to those responders in HCV-infected individuals who had received a series of HBV immunizations. PD-1 expression on CD4(+) T cells was detected at relatively higher levels in these HBV vaccine non-responders than those who responded, and this was inversely associated with the cell activation status. Importantly, blocking the PD-1 pathway improved T cell activation and proliferation in response to ex vivo HBsAg or anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation in HBV vaccine non-responders. These results suggest that PD-1 signaling may be involved in impairing CD4(+) T cell responses to HBV vaccination in subjects with HCV infection, and raise the possibility that blocking this negative signaling pathway might improve success rates of immunization in the setting of chronic viral infection."
9201,0.004,4.0000,"Mutations in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) core gene may influence disease activity by altering immune recognition sites or level of virus replication. Sera from 69 Chinese patients with chronic HBV infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction amplification of HBV DNA to determine the frequency and location of naturally occurring HBV core gene mutations. All but one patient had nucleotide changes, and 44 (64%) patients had at least one amino acid change (mean, 3.7; range, 1-13) when compared with published sequences. Multiple regression analysis showed that the frequency of core gene mutations was significantly associated with precore stop-codon mutation, hepatitis B e antigen negativity, and active liver disease, but not patients' age. The mean number of amino acid changes/patient for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients with elevated versus normal aminotransferase levels were, respectively, 2.8 +/- 0.4 and 0.6 +/- 0.2. The corresponding values for HBeAg-negative patients were, respectively, 5.0 +/- 1.2 and 6.0 +/- 1.5. Thirteen patients were serially studied, the mean rates of amino acid substitution in HBeAg-positive patients who did or did not clear HBeAg during follow-up were 5.7 +/- 0.8 and 0 per codon/yr. Most of the mutations were clustered in the codon/yr. Most of the mutations were clustered in the middle of the core gene that harbor several major B- and helper T-cell epitopes. Very few mutations were found in the C-terminal part of the core gene. In summary, mutations in the core gene can be frequently detected in patients with chronic HBV infection. These mutations occur predominantly around the time of HBeAg clearance when liver disease is most active."
7381,0.004,4.0000,"Coinfection of blood-borne hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-positive individuals frequently occurs in inmate population and peculiar viral strains and patterns of virological markers may be observed.Plasma from 69 HIV-1-positive inmates was obtained from 7 clinical centers connected with correctional centers in different towns in Italy. HIV, HBV, and HCV markers were tested by commercial assays. Virus genotyping was carried out by sequencing the protease and reverse transcriptase-encoding region (PR-RT region) for HIV and a region encompassing the NS5B gene for HCV and subsequent phylogenetic analysis.Twelve over 14 HIV-subtyped inmates were infected with HIV-1 subtype B strains. The 2 non-B strains belonged to subtype G and CRF02_AG, in an Italian and a Gambian patient, respectively. Variants carrying the K103N and Y181C resistance mutations to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) were found in 2 out of 9 patients naive for combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) (22.2%). Most HIV-positive patients (92.8%) showed evidence of past or present HBV and/or HCV infection. Prevalence of HBV and HCV was 81.2% for both viruses, whereas prevalence of HBV/HCV coinfection was 69.6%. A significantly higher presence of HCV infection was found in Italians [odds ratio (OR) 11.0; interval 1.7-80.9] and in drug users (OR 27.8; interval 4.9-186.0). HCV subtypes were determined in 42 HCV or HBV/HCV-coinfected individuals. HCV subtypes 1a, 3a, 4d, and 1b were found in 42.9%, 40.5%, 14.3%, and 2.4% of inmates, respectively. Low titers of HBV DNA in HBV DNA positive subjects precluded HBV subtyping.The high prevalence of HBV and HCV coinfections in HIV-infected inmates, as well as the heterogeneity of HIV and HCV subtypes suggest the need to adopt systematic controls in prisons to monitor both the burden and the genetic forms of blood-borne viral infections, in order to apply targeted therapeutic interventions."
5531,0.004,4.0000,"Effective antiretroviral therapy initially resulted in large decreases in hospitalization rates of HIV-infected patients. The goal of this study was to determine whether these gains were being maintained in 2001. A cross-sectional study of hospital admission characteristics during four time periods was performed. All patients receiving care at the HIV clinics of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (NYPH) in New York City were included. In 1995, 883 outpatients were receiving care for HIV infection at NYPH; this increased to 1990 outpatients by 2001. Demographic and laboratory information was obtained for these outpatients, and diagnoses were recorded for all patients requiring hospitalization on at NYPH during the time periods January 1 through June 30, in 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001. The incidence of hospital admission declined in all four time periods: 1995 (95 per 100 patient-years [pt-yr]), 1997 (48 per 100 pt-yr), 1999 (38 per 100 pt-yr, p < 0.05), and 2001 (25 per 100 pt-yr). The incidence of bacterial pneumonia and opportunistic infections (OIs) decreased in all four time periods. The median hospitalization were CD4(+) cell count for outpatients increased from 231 (1995) to 364 (2001). Important predictors of hospitalization were CD4(+) < 200, and IVDU as an HIV risk factor. Since 1995 and the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, continuing increases in CD4(+) cell counts of outpatients has been reflected in persistent declines in hospitalization rates. Large decreases in OIs and pneumonia have been minimally offset by stable rates of hospital admissions for diagnoses such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and cellulitis."
7352,0.004,4.0000,"The simultaneous detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to hepatitis B surface (anti-HBs) is unusual in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but may be related with more advanced liver diseases. This retrospective long-term cohort study was aimed to investigate whether coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs may increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic HBV infection. A total of 1,042 non-HCC patients were recruited and followed up for a median 4.3 years (range 1.0-22 years). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for HCC development. The prevalence of coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs was 7.0% (73/1,042). In univariate analysis, the 5-, 10-, and 15-year cumulative incidences of HCC were significantly higher in coexistence group than in HBsAg only group (12.7%, 23.4%, 69.4% vs. 4.9%, 13%, 20.6%, respectively; P = 0.008). In multivariate analysis, coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs [Hazard ratio (HR), 2.001; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.023-3.912; P = 0.043] as well as male gender [HR, 1.898; 95% CI, 0.31-0.896; P = 0.018], age over 40 years [HR, 14.56; 95% CI, 4.499-47.08; P = 0.0001], and cirrhosis [HR, 7.995; 95% CI, 4.756-13.439; P = 0.0001] was identified as the independent factor for HCC development. Also, the cumulative incidence of HCC increased in proportion to the number of the risk factors. In conclusion, coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs may increase independently the risk of HCC development in chronic HBV infection. Therefore, consideration of HCC development is required in patients with coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs."
7640,0.004,4.0000,"Dementia was a frequent consequence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in developed countries before antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available and remains a common neurologic complication of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among patients receiving appropriate therapy. The epidemiology of HIV dementia (HIV-D) in Africa remains unclear 20+ years into the AIDS epidemic. Early studies of cognitive impairment in HIV-positive populations in Africa were limited by vaguely defined criteria for cognitive impairment, inadequate assessment tools lacking ecologic validation, and the absence of normative population data. More recent studies have clarified definitions of impairment, utilized more sophisticated measures, and included normative comparisons. Unfortunately, these detailed neuropsychiatric assessments are not feasible for population-based studies or routine clinical implementation. Therefore, the prevalence data available for HIV-D in Africa represents rates found in people presenting to tertiary care centers and are unlikely to reflect HIV-D rates in the general population. As ART becomes available in Africa, future research efforts must provide a better understanding of the epidemiology of HIV-D, the effects of available ART regimens on HIV-D in this population, and the impact of HIV-D on ART adherence. Universally accepted terminology and criteria for HIV-D are needed. Population-based studies will require the development of neuropsychiatric batteries that can be adapted across a range of African environments. Ideally, these measures will be viable for nonphysician care providers to use as screening tools in the first stage of epidemiologic studies. Such screening tools could also serve as clinical indicators of possible HIV-related cognitive impairment facilitate implementation of ART adherence."
8762,0.004,4.0000,"Abstract While the Internet has the potential to educate persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), websites may contain inaccurate information and increase the risk of nonadherence with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The objectives of our study were to determine the extent to which PLWHA engage in Internet health information seeking behavior (IHISB) and to determine whether IHISB is associated with ART adherence. We conducted a survey of adult, English-speaking HIV-infected patients at four HIV outpatient clinic sites in the United States (Baltimore, Maryland; Detroit, Michigan; New York, and Portland, Oregon) between December 2004 and January 2006. We assessed IHISB by asking participants how much information they had received from the Internet since acquiring HIV. The main outcome was patient-reported ART adherence over the past three days. Data were available on IHISB for 433 patients, 334 of whom were on ART therapy. Patients had a mean age of 45 (standard error [SE] 0.45) years and were mostly male (66%), African American (58%), and had attained a high school degree (73%). Most (55%) reported no IHISB, 18% reported some, and 27% reported ""a fair amount"" or ""a great deal."" Patients who reported higher versus lower levels of IHISB were significantly younger, had achieved a higher level of education, and had higher medication self-efficacy. In unadjusted analyses, higher IHISB was associated with ART adherence (odds ratio [OR], 2.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-6.94). This association persisted after adjustment for age, gender, race, education, clinic site, and medication self-efficacy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.76, 95% CI 1.11-6.87). Our findings indicate that IHISB is positively associated with ART adherence even after controlling for potentially confounding variables. Future studies should investigate the ways in which Internet health information may promote medication adherence among PLWHA."
199,0.004,4.0000,"The term 'genotyping' describes the genetic characterization of a genome. The genotype analysis is performed to identify mutations that differentiate one individual or strain from another. The mutations may confer resistance to specific antiviral drugs or they may simply allow classification of a strain as to 'type' and 'subtype'. There are four human viruses for which genotype information is clinically useful. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are being treated with antiretroviral drugs and resistance after prolonged treatment is common. Since HBV cannot be cultured, the only method of detecting resistance-conferring mutations in the genome is a genotypic analysis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be cured by treatment with the combination of interferon and ribavirin but certain strains of virus are more resistant to treatment than others. The current recommendations are that all HCV type 1 infections be treated for 12 months whereas other types may be successfully treated in 6 months. Since interferon treatment may have significant side effects, the determination of HCV genotype is an important aspect of this therapeutic regimen. Treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease with nucleoside analogues occasionally results in resistant virus with mutations in the phosphotransferase gene (UL97) and/or the DNA polymerase gene (UL54) that can be tested with phenotypic or genotypic assays. Since CMV grows very slowly, it may be more clinically useful to perform a rapid genotypic assay although only the UL97 gene can be efficiently genotyped. Finally, the virus for which genotyping has become the standard of care, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can now be genotyped routinely by many clinical virology labs experienced with molecular amplification methods and automated DNA sequencing technology. All currently-available antiretroviral drugs are directed against either the protease or reverse transcriptase genes of HIV-1 and the mutations within these genes that confer resistance have been well described. Sequence-based genotyping methods are not necessarily the best approach for routine genotyping of these four viruses, but sequencing is the gold standard from which other methods are developed and against which they are compared."
4973,0.004,4.0000,"The introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection has significantly improved the life expectancy of HIV positive patients. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection is common in HIV infected patients and is now a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Optimal management and treatment of HCV in HIV infected patients is therefore essential. Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and ribavirin is the mainstay of treatment for HCV infection in HIV infected people. The sustained virological response rate (SVR) with combination therapy is lower than that commonly observed in HCV mono-infected patients. This is, at least in part, due to the very high treatment drop out rates. Ribavirin in combination with HAART is associated with particular side effects such as mitochondrial toxicity. Therefore, vigilant monitoring of patients during therapy, in specialist centers is essential. Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin is particularly promising as it is easier to administer and will probably become the treatment of choice for co-infected patients. A SVR is associated with genotype 2 and 3, in addition to a high CD4+ cell count and a low HCV load prior to therapy. The progression of HCV related liver disease in HIV positive patients is faster than in subjects with HCV infection alone. As a result, there is an increasing incidence of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease in co-infected patients. Liver transplantation is being evaluated in many centers. To date the experiences are very limited but encouraging in term of survival rate."
4429,0.004,4.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is able to evade the host cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response through a variety of escape avenues. Epitopes that are presented to CTLs are first processed in the presenting cell in several steps, including proteasomal cleavage, transport to the endoplasmic reticulum, binding by the HLA molecule, and finally presentation to the T-cell receptor. An understanding of the potential of the virus to escape CTL responses can aid in designing an effective vaccine. To investigate such a potential, we analyzed HIV-1 gag from 468 HIV-1-positive Kenyan women by using several bioinformatic approaches that allowed the identification of positively selected amino acids in the HIV-1 gag region and study of the effects that these mutations could have on the various stages of antigen processing. Correlations between positively selected residues and mean CD4 counts also allowed study of the effect of mutation on HIV disease progression. A number of mutations that could create or destroy proteasomal cleavage sites or reduce binding affinity of the transport antigen processing protein, effectively hindering epitope presentation, were identified. Many mutations correlated with the presence of specific HLA alleles and with lower or higher CD4 counts. For instance, the mutation V190I in subtype A1-infected individuals is associated with HLA-B*5802 (P = 4.73 x 10(-4)), a rapid-progression allele according to other studies, and also to a decreased mean CD4 count (P = 0.019). Thus, V190I is a possible HLA escape mutant. This method classifies many positively selected mutations across the entire gag region according to their potential for immune escape and their effect on disease progression."
5972,0.004,4.0000,"Considerable controversy and uncertainty have surrounded the biological function of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 nef gene product. Initial studies suggested that this early, nonstructural viral protein functioned as a negative regulatory factor; thus, it was proposed to play a role in establishing or maintaining viral latency. In contrast, studies in Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV)mac-infected rhesus monkeys have suggested that Nef is not a negative factor but rather plays a central role in promoting high-level viral replication and is required for viral pathogenesis in vivo. We sought to define a tissue culture system that would approximate the in vivo setting for virus infection in order to assess the role of HIV-1 Nef in viral replication. We show that infection of mitogen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with Nef+ HIV results in enhanced replication as evidenced by earlier gag p24 expression when compared with infections performed with nef mutant viruses. Moreover, when unstimulated freshly isolated PBMC are infected with Nef+ and Nef- viruses and then subsequently activated with mitogen, the Nef-induced difference in viral replication kinetics is even more pronounced, with the Nef- viruses requiring much more time in culture for appreciable growth. A positive effect of Nef on viral replication was also observed in primary macrophages infected with a recombinant of YU-2, a patient-derived molecular clone with macrophage tropism. These positive effects of Nef on viral replication are dependent on the initial multiplicity of infection (MOI), in that infections of unstimulated PBMC at low MOI are most dependent upon intact nef for subsequent viral growth. We now provide evidence that the Nef+ HIV is more infectious than Nef- HIV from both a tissue culture infectious dose analysis, and a single-cell HIV infection assay. In the latter case, we demonstrate that infection with equivalent doses of HIV based on virion-associated gag p24 yields five- to sixfold more infected cells if Nef+ viral stocks were used. Furthermore, we find that the differential infectivity is not dependent on CD4 down-regulation as Nef+ virus produced from transfected COS cells lacking CD4 is also more infectious. However, normalization of PBMC infections to equivalent infectivity between that of the Nef+ and Nef- viruses continues to reveal delayed viral replication in the absence of Nef, suggesting that secondary viral spread in PBMC is also enhanced in Nef+ infections. We demonstrate this directly by showing a 13-15-fold increase in infectivity of PBMC-derived Nef+ HIC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
1717,0.004,4.0000,"Albania is a Mediterranean country, still with a high endemicity level of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The chronic hepatitis B profile was characterized in this geographical area and used as a model to investigate the impact of endemicity level on the prevalence of the two major forms of chronic hepatitis B (HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B). A cross-sectional study was conducted among 62 chronic hepatitis B patients consecutively admitted to the most important tertiary health care center for the diagnosis and treatment of liver disease in Albania. HBV-DNA was measured with an in-house PCR with a sensitivity of 10(4) copies/ml which uses primers encompassing the pre-core/core region. PCR products were subjected to sequencing and oligohybridization assay. Of the 62 patients, 75.8% had HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B. Genotype D was found in all 39 patients with detectable HBV viremia, for whom the heterogeneity of the region modulating HBeAg expression was assessed. Basic core promoter (BCP) mutations (1762/1764) were observed more often in anti-HBe-positive and older patients. In more than 90% of the HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients with detectable viremia, HBV that carries the G to A pre-core mutation at nucleotide 1896 was found. Patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B were younger than HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients, and for symptomatic and asymptomatic liver-disease patients, the age of peak prevalence was at least 10 years lower for HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients. In conclusion, the virological and clinical pattern of chronic hepatitis B in Albania is similar to that observed in other Mediterranean countries; it seems to be independent of the HBV endemicity level."
8860,0.004,4.0000,"Increased access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by human immunodeficiency virus postive (HIV⁺) individuals has become a reality worldwide. In Brazil, HAART currently reaches over half of HIV-infected subjects. In the context of a remarkable HIV-1 genetic variability, highly related variants, called quasispecies, are generated. HIV quasispecies generated during infection can influence virus persistence and pathogenicity, representing a challenge to treatment. However, the clinical relevance of minority quasispecies is still uncertain. In this study, we have determined the archived proviral sequences, viral subtype and drug resistance mutations from a cohort of HIV⁺ patients with undetectable viral load undergoing HAART as first-line therapy using next-generation sequencing for near full-length virus genome (NFLG) assembly. HIV-1 consensus sequences representing NFLG were obtained for eleven patients, while for another twelve varying genome coverage rates were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed the predominance of subtype B (83%; 19/23). Considering the minority variants, 18 patients carried archived virus harboring at least one mutation conferring antiretroviral resistance; for six patients, the mutations correlated with the current ARVs used. These data highlight the importance of monitoring HIV minority drug resistant variants and their clinical impact, to guide future regimen switches and improve HIV treatment success."
2026,0.004,4.0000,"We estimate how the effect of antiretroviral treatment depends on the time from HIV-infection to initiation of treatment, using observational data. A major challenge in making inferences from such observational data arises from biases associated with the nonrandom assignment of treatment, for example bias induced by dependence of time of initiation on disease status. To address this concern, we develop a new class of Structural Nested Mean Models (SNMMs) to estimate the impact of time of initiation of treatment after infection on an outcome measured a fixed duration after initiation, compared to the effect of not initiating treatment. This leads to a SNMM that models the effect of multiple dosages of treatment on a time-dependent outcome, in contrast to most existing SNNMs, which focus on the effect of one dosage of treatment on an outcome measured at the end of the study. Our identifying assumption is that there are no unmeasured confounders. We illustrate our methods using the observational Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP) Core01 database on HIV. The current standard of care in HIV-infected patients is Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Treatment (HAART); however, the optimal time to start HAART has not yet been identified. The new class of SNNMs allows estimation of the dependence of the effect of 1 year of HAART on the time between estimated date of infection and treatment initiation, and on patient characteristics. Results of fitting this model imply that early use of HAART substantially improves immune reconstitution in the early and acute phase of HIV-infection."
2138,0.004,4.0000,"Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are a special group with growing interest. In order to study the epidemiological data of HIV+ patients on RRT in Spain, we collected individual information from 2004-2011 (period of use of highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART] in the Autonomous Communities of Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, Catalonia, Valencia, Castilla la Mancha, Castilla León, Galicia, Madrid, La Rioja and the Basque Country, comprising 85% of the Spanish population. A total of 271 incident and 209 prevalent patients were analysed. They were compared with the remaining patients on RRT during the same period. The annual incidence was 0.8 patients per one million inhabitants, with a significant increase during the follow-up period. The proportion of prevalent HIV+ patients was 5.1 per 1,000 patients on RRT (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4-5.8. Although glomerular diseases constituted the majority of cases (42%), diabetic nephropathy was the cause in 14% of patients. The nation-wide totals for these percentages were 13 and 25%, respectively. Compared to the total of patients in treatment, the risk of death was significantly higher in the HIV+ group: hazard ratio (HR) adjusted for age, sex and diabetes was 2.26 (95% CI 1.74 - 2.91). Hepatitis C coinfection increased the risk of death in the HIV+ group (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.10 - 2.85). The probability of kidney transplantation in HIV+ was only 17% after 7 years, comparing with total RTT patients (HR 0.15; 95% CI: 0.10-0.24). Despite the use of HAART, the incidence of HIV+ patients on dialysis has increased; their mortality still exceeds non-HIV patients, and they have a very low rate of transplantation. It is necessary to further our knowledge of this disease in order to improve results. "
7090,0.004,4.0000,"Raltegravir, as the first HIV integrase inhibitor, has been used and prospectively monitored since 2010 in our HIV outpatient centre, where over 1,200 patients are monitored. The aim of our report is to perform an interim assessment of the background, the safety profile and the clinical-laboratory monitoring of all patients treated with a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including raltegravir, for at least 12 months. In all, 109 pretreated patients started a raltegravir-containing cART when aged 44.8 plus or minus 19.2 years, with a history of HIV infection lasting 13.4 plus or minus 9.7 years. All subjects were monitored for at least 12 months (mean 17.2 plus or minus 10.3 months). In the vast majority of cases (93 of 109: 85.3%), multiple (3-16) prior cART changes prompted raltegravir introduction in advanced-salvage lines: 72 of 109 (66.1%) patients had even developed a concurrent triple-class resistance to anti-HIV compounds. The most frequent companion antiretroviral agents were: darunavir/ritonavir (75 cases), maraviroc (47 subjects), and etravirine (38 cases). The most common underlying conditions were: AIDS (46 patients), liver cirrhosis (31 cases), AIDS-related or other malignancies (23 cases), and major cardio-cerebro-vascular events (18 cases). A chronic HCV and HBV hepatitis were of concern in 48 and 23 patients, respectively. The adjunct of raltegravir favourably affected all clinical-laboratory markers of HIV disease progression, and those of the broad spectrum of comorbidities, except for two patients who failed the raltegravir-containing cART due to insufficient adherence. Despite the already compromised clinical situation, a minority of subjects experienced mild-transient clinical-laboratory untoward events possibly attributable to raltegravir, such that no patients discontinued raltegravir during the observation period. Only three AIDS-defining conditions became apparent during raltegravir-based cART; chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy cycles were performed as scheduled in patients suffering from cancer; chronic hepatitis B and C progressed to liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocarcinoma in only 2 and 6 patients. Otherwise, treatment with pegylated interferon-ribavirin became feasible in 25 patients of 48 with chronic HCV. During raltegravir-containing cART, neither autoimmune disorders nor novel malignancies were diagnosed. Only mild-transient gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue, dizziness, insomnia and cutaneous rash were reported, although their relationship with the study drug was difficult to assess due to multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. Abnormal liver function testings were observed in 57 patients (52.3%), all suffering from concurrent hepato-biliary disorders. Significant increases in serum lipids and/or lipase levels versus baseline values were never registered: serum lipid levels significantly improved after raltegravir introduction. Our experience with raltegravir underlines its excellent efficacy and safety profile, which exploits a novel mechanism of action, and displays no cross-resistance with any other antiretroviral. A progressively extended prescription in naive patients and early cART lines will allow the therapeutic potential of raltegravir to be exploited. "
1475,0.004,4.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has considerably improved the prognosis of HIV-infected patients. However, prolonged use of HAART has been related to long-term adverse events that can compromise patient health such as HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is consistent evidence for a central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in these pathologies. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have been described to be mainly responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction in adipose tissue and liver although nonnucleoside transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs) have also showed mitochondrial toxicity, which is a major concern for the selection and the long-term adherence to a particular therapy. Several mechanisms explain these deleterious effects of HAART on mitochondria, and evidence points to other mechanisms beyond the ""Pol- γ hypothesis."" HIV infection has also direct effects on mitochondria. In addition to the negative effects described for HIV itself and/or HAART on mitochondria, HIV-infected patients are more prone to develop a premature aging and, therefore, to present an increased oxidative state that could lead to the development of these metabolic disturbances observed in HIV-infected patients.

1000,0.004,4.0000,"Golgi protein-73 (GP73) is upregulated in cancers and viral infections; however, its role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) remains undetermined. GP73 was evaluated as a biomarker of HIV progression and AIDS treatment efficacy. Forty-eight HIV patients (≤ 350 CD4 + T cells/μL) undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART group) and 18 HIV patients expected to undergo HAART within 9 months (>350 CD4 + T cells/μL) (control group) were enrolled in a prospective, single center, cohort study from May 2009 to Jun 2012. Blood aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cholesterol, triglycerides, and total bilirubin were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (HAART group) or 3 month intervals (control group). Serum HIV RNA level (viral load) was determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) GP73 concentration were determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay kit and western blot, respectively. Significant positive and negative correlations in baseline serum GP73 concentration and HIV viral load (r = 0.39, P < 0.001) and CD4 + T cell count (r = -0.501, P < 0.001) were observed, respectively. In receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.79 (95 % CI 0.66-0.92). The sensitivity and specificity of GP73 for correct identification of patients with ≤350 CD4 + T cells/μL were 76.09 and 75.0 %, respectively, with an ROC-derived cut-off of 100.6 ng/mL. For HIV patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy, GP73 may be a potential biomarker treatment efficacy useful in AIDS management."
2019,0.004,4.0000,"The main goal of the present paper was to analyze the molecular diversity of the principal neutralizing domain (V3 loop) of the HIV 1 gp120 in samples from patients of Argentina. The study was carried out on a total of 30 HIV 1 positive blood samples, obtained during 1991-1992, belonging to 15 intravenous drug users (group A), 5 homosexual men (group B), 8 children born to HIV 1 positive mothers (group C) and 2 AIDS patients (group D). By using extracted DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and from infected cells of the viral isolates in the case of the 2 AIDS patients, the V3 loop region was amplified by means of polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequencing by Sanger methodology was then performed on DNA fragments and nucleotide sequences obtained were translated into the correspondent amino acids. Consensus sequences for each group and a general consensus sequence were established (Table 1). Its alignment with V3 loop amino acid sequences of the major HIV 1 strains isolated worldwide is showed in table 2. Homology analysis between each sequence of the study population and sequence of different HIV 1 isolates showed that most of these samples share high homology with SF2 and BH10 strains. In contrast a low homology was found with JH3 and MN isolated (table 3). The presence of highly conserved amino acid residues as substitutions and insertions was determined in the Argentinian V3 loop sequences giving them a local pattern. The present paper is of great importance for our country, considering that the V3 loop is the main neutralizing domain becoming a major target in the development of HIV 1 vaccine. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the sequencing of the principal neutralizing domain of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 in Latin America."
4606,0.004,4.0000,"Worldwide viral hepatitis is the most common cause of jaundice, chronic liver disease cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. While important advances have been made in prevention of viral hepatitis, therapy of this disease remains unsatisfactory. There are no specific therapies of proven benefit for acute hepatitis, although use of alpha-interferon during the acute phase of hepatitis C may result in a decrease in the rate of chronicity. For chronic viral hepatitis, alpha-interferon has been widely used, but is expensive, poorly tolerated and limited in effectiveness. New antiviral agents and use of combinations of antivirals are now being evaluated and promise to provide a therapy that is effective in the majority of patients. The currently recommended therapy of chronic hepatitis B is a 4- to 6-month course of alpha-interferon in doses of 5-10 million units three times a week; a regimen that results in sustained clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) from serum in approximately one-third and a loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in one-tenth of patients. Long-term follow-up of patients who respond to interferon treatment with clearance of HBeAg indicate that the majority ultimately clear HBsAg as well and have continued remission in the liver disease, although low levels of HBV DNA can commonly be detected in liver tissue. Better therapies of hepatitis B are needed. Recently, several oral 'second-generation' nucleoside analogues have been developed that have potent activity against HBV. The best studied is lamivudine (3-thiacytidine) which results in marked inhibition of HBV DNA levels and improvement in serum aminotransferases and hepatic histology in the majority of patients. When stopped, however, most patients relapse and the shortcomings of long-term therapy have been the development of viral resistance in up to one-quarter of patients within a year and a higher percentage with more prolonged therapy. Future approaches of therapy of promise for hepatitis B are combinations of lamivudine with interferon and other antiviral nucleoside analogues. The currently recommended therapy of chronic hepatitis C is a 12- to 18-month course of alpha interferon in doses of 3 million units three times a week: a regimen that results in sustained clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in approximately 20% of patients. Sustained responses have been associated with marked improvements in hepatic histology and long-term studies indicate that the majority of patients remain free of virus in serum and liver, suggesting a 'cure' of infection. Responses to interferon correlate to some degree with clinical and virological features, including young age, absence of hepatic fibrosis, low levels of HCV RNA in serum and HCV genotypes 2 and 3.

9188,0.004,4.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates from Iranian patients around the country were characterized. Eighty-one complete genomes from HBV isolates were sequenced and analyzed. The studied population was grouped into three categories including inactive carriers, patients with chronic hepatitis, and patients with liver cirrhosis. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses revealed that Iranian patients were infected with HBV genotype D and subgenotype D1. The most common subtype was ayw2, followed by ayw3 and ayw4. Several deletions and insertions that had no correlation with disease outcome were observed in the HBV genomes. The most frequent mutation in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was sP120S. Almost half of the patients studied carried precore (PC) mutant variants and one-third of the studied population was infected with variants carrying basal core promoter (BCP) mutations. PC and BCP mutations were observed in older patients, especially in those with chronic liver disease. Sixty-seven patients (82.7%) were HBeAg negative, and the prevalence of precore mutant isolates (G1896A) was higher in this group than in HBeAg-positive patients. Lamivudine drug resistance mutations were detected after 1 year of treatment in about 30% of lamivudine-treated patients. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that HBV subgenotype D1 is the only subgenotype circulating in Iran, and there is no evidence of any exotic genotype in the region. The HBV PC (G1896A) mutation may play an important role in the clinical outcome of the disease by increasing the risk of progressive liver disease among Iranian patients infected with HBV."
9345,0.004,4.0000,"Co-infection of HBV with HIV results in an accelerated course of HBV-associated chronic liver disease. Several studies have shown that viral mutations are related to disease progression in mono-infection with HBV. However, it is unclear whether HBV mutation patterns might differ between co-infected and mono-infected patients. To compare the frequencies and mutation patterns in the HBV genome between co-infection and mono-infection. Twenty-four treatment-naïve co-infected and 31 treatment-naïve mono-infected Thai patients were included. HBV mutations were characterized by whole genome sequencing of virus serum samples. The clinical features and frequency of known clinically significant mutations were compared between the two groups. No significant difference between the groups was found with respect to sex, age and HBeAg. However, HBV DNA levels were significantly higher in co-infected patients. The distribution of HBV genotypes was comparable between the two groups and restricted mostly to sub-genotypes C1 and B2. An isolate with recombinants of genotypes G/C1 was also identified in a patient with co-infection. There was no difference in the prevalence of mutations in the enhancer II/basal core promoter/precore region, pre-S/S and polymerase genes between the two groups. In conclusion, dual infections tend to engender increased HBV DNA levels. There was no major difference in the frequencies of common HBV mutations between co-infected and mono-infected patients. Thus, HBV mutations may not contribute to disease pathogenesis in Thai patients with co-infection."
2968,0.004,4.0000,"Clinical observations suggest that chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in the Canadian Inuit are less often associated with serious adverse outcomes than has been described in other HBV-infected patient populations. The aim of this study was to document the clinical and biochemical features, liver-related morbidity and all-cause mortality in Canadian Inuit with chronic HBV infections. Administrative databases were reviewed for individuals identified as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive during a 1983-85 seroepidemiological survey of viral hepatitis in Baffin Island, Canada. An equal number of age- and gender-matched HBsAg-negative individuals from the same communities served as controls. Baseline HBV viral loads, genotypes and specific mutations were compared in HBsAg-positive survivors and nonsurvivors. A subset of surviving HBsAg-positive carriers were reassessed 25-30 years following their initial diagnosis for evidence of advanced liver disease and changes to their serological/virological findings. One hundred and forty four HBsAg-positive individuals were identified. All were Canadian Inuit. The mean age at diagnosis was 38 ± 17 years and 69 (61%) were male. Median follow-up was 23 years (range: 2-28 years). Viral quantitation from stored sera could be performed in 70 infected individuals. The median viral load was 4.3 log 10 IU/ml (range: 2.3-8.8 log 10 IU/ml), and all were genotype B, subgenotype B6. Liver biochemistry, morbidity and all-cause mortality rates were similar in HBsAg-positive carriers and controls. Following multivariate analyses, only age at diagnosis predicted mortality in HBsAg carriers. In a subset of 30 HBsAg-positive survivors who underwent follow-up assessments, clinical, biochemical and radiological examinations of the liver were essentially normal. 23/30 (77%) remained HBsAg positive and 17/19 (90%) HBV-DNA positive. The genotype and prevalence of genomic mutations in this cohort remained largely unchanged, but quantifiable viral loads were significantly lower (P < 0.003). The results of this study suggest that chronic HBV infections in the Canadian Inuit are infrequently associated with serious adverse outcomes. Whether this finding reflects unique features of the host, presence or absence of external factors that influence the course of HBV and/or intrinsic properties of the HBV B6 subgenotype remains to be determined."
3107,0.004,4.0000,"Population-wide variation in genomic RNA of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encompassing the V3 loop of the envelope protein was studied in serum samples of 74 newly infected individuals from three Dutch cohorts: 30 homosexual men, 32 drug users, and 12 hemophiliacs. During acute infection, HIV-1 RNA sequences present in serum are relatively homogeneous, which makes direct sequencing feasible. This offered an opportunity to study the infecting virus variants before mutations had accumulated in the new host. The sampling dates ranged from 1980 to 1991, thus spanning the entire AIDS epidemic in The Netherlands. The diversity in the sequenced region increased over time in both the homosexual and the drug-user risk groups. Furthermore, this increase was associated with an increase in antigenic variation, as witnessed by serum reactivity to a V3 peptide panel. Despite this diversification, some 1990 sequences still closely resembled the earliest 1980 sequence, making ancestral inferences problematic. No evidence was found of a change in the master sequence of the virus quasi-species over time. At the amino acid level, no risk-group-associated variation was found, but at the nucleotide level, the drug-user and homosexual/hemophiliac sequences could be distinguished on the basis of a single silent nucleotide change in the sequence encoding the tip of the V3 loop. Hemophiliac sequences could not be distinguished from those of homosexuals. In spite of the large and increasing genetic variability, all sequences were more similar to the European/American HIV consensus sequence than to that of non-Western strains."
9715,0.004,4.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major public health problem worldwide. Until recently, interferon (IFN)-alpha was the only approved drug for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. The recent registration of lamivudine, a dideoxycytidine analogue that inhibits both the HIV and HBV reverse transcriptases, has provided new perspectives for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. Lamivudine treatment for 12 months leads to a control of viral replication during therapy in the majority of the patients and to sustained anti-hepatitis B e (anti-HBe) seroconversion in 16 to 22% of the patients, associated with a biochemical and histological response. Further studies showed that extended lamivudine therapy increases the rate of anti-HBe seroconversion. However, long-term therapy is associated with the progressive emergence of drug resistant mutants. In most cases these mutants are not associated with a deterioration of the liver disease within the available follow-up. In the remaining patients and in particular settings such as liver transplantation, a severe exacerbation of the liver disease is observed and that requires add-on therapy. Lamivudine treatment of patients infected with a pre-core mutant also showed beneficial effect with the control of viral replication, and a biochemical and histological response in approximately 60% of the patients at 1 year. These patients face the same problem of drug resistant mutants, and the optimal duration of lamivudine treatment still needs to be determined in this clinical situation. Moreover, lamivudine therapy is the only therapeutic option in decompensated cirrhotic patients to allow liver transplantation, and in liver transplant patients with HBV recurrence following transplantation. Adverse effects of lamivudine therapy are comparable to those observed in placebo-treated patients. ALT flares have been observed mainly in relation to the re-occurrence of viral replication due to the rebound of viral replication after therapy withdrawal, or to the emergence of drug resistance mutants. Therefore, lamivudine provides a new treatment alternative for patients with chronic HBV infection. For each patient, its indication has to be weighed against the risk of developing viral resistance but also against the risk of natural history of the disease."
2031,0.004,4.0000,"Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is more prevalent than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but more public health resources are allocated to HIV than to HCV. Given shared risk factors and epidemiology, we compared accuracy of health beliefs about HIV and HCV in an at-risk community. Between 2002 and 2003, we surveyed a random patient sample at a primary care clinic in New York. The survey was organized as domains of Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation: causes ('sharing needles'), timeline/consequences ('remains in body for life', 'causes cancer') and controllability ('I can avoid this illness', 'medications may cure this illness'). We compared differences in accuracy of beliefs about HIV and HCV and used multivariable linear regression to identify factors associated with relative accuracy of beliefs. One hundred and twenty-two subjects completed the survey (response rate 42%). Mean overall health belief accuracy was 12/15 questions (80%) for HIV vs 9/15 (60%) for HCV (P < 0.001). Belief accuracy was significantly different across all domains. Within the causes domain, 60% accurately believed sharing needles a risk factor for HCV compared to 92% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the timeline/consequences domain, 42% accurately believed HCV results in lifelong infection compared to 89% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the controllability domain, 25% accurately believed that there is a potential cure for HCV. Multivariable linear regression revealed female gender as significantly associated with greater health belief accuracy for HIV. Thus, study participants had significantly less accurate health beliefs about HCV than about HIV. Targeting inaccuracies might improve public health interventions to foster healthier behaviours and better hepatitis C outcomes."
5650,0.004,4.0000,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is increasing in the heterosexual community and people already affected by HIV are living longer. As a result, health visitors will be more involved in caring for people with HIV and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge level of health visitors about HIV infection and AIDS, and to identify some of the attitudes held by them concerning AIDS and the variety of symptoms that can occur in HIV positive individuals (AIDS related complex) before they have actually developed AIDS. The influence of AIDS-related education and the experience of caring for affected patients on health visitors' knowledge of the disease was assessed. The attitudes of carers towards these patients were also ascertained. All heath visitors (n = 88) working in the Merton and Sutton Community Healthcare Trust were invited to participate in a questionnaire survey. Fifty-five health visitors participated. Knowledge relating to HIV and AIDS was good, but the majority of respondents felt they did not have all the information they needed about HIV and AIDS. Almost one-quarter of respondents had cared for a client who was either HIV positive or had AIDS. Overall, the findings were quite encouraging. However, further education, training, and support were identified as necessary. These shortfalls need to be addressed in order to fully assist health visitors in their role of caring for clients and families affected by HIV and AIDS."
9387,0.004,4.0000,"Measurement of quality of life is crucial to assess the full impact of antiretroviral therapy on patient morbidity. No quality of life instruments have been validated in an Asian HIV-infected patient population, but it is important to do so given the increasing involvement of the region in clinical trials. We set out to validate the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) in HIV infected patients in Singapore. Clinically stable outpatients were asked to complete the 30-item MOS-HIV (English or Chinese translation). Patients were also asked about the frequency of selected disease symptoms, and clinical and demographic data were recorded from the case sheet. 163 patients (90% Chinese, 96% male, mean age 38 years, mean CD4 count 159 cells/mm(3)) participated in the study and completed the questionnaire to a satisfactory standard. The questionnaire showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >0.7 in all cases). There were significant differences in quality of life scores between Centers for Disease Control disease stages, and significant correlations with CD4 count and symptom score, confirming the discriminant validity of the MOS-HIV. Factor analysis revealed two components corresponding to physical and mental health which were similar to those of studies in Western countries except that pain was more closely related to mental than physical health. Linear regression analysis identified symptom burden as the major predictor of physical and mental health. We concluded that the MOS-HIV is a valid measure of quality of life in this HIV patient population in Singapore, and is therefore likely to be useful in future clinical trials in the region. In the era of chronic HIV disease, close attention to symptoms (disease or drug-related) is warranted due to their major adverse influence on mental and physical aspects of quality of life."
6218,0.004,4.0000,"The goal in this article is to examine social problems associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence in Mexico and the related challenges for Mexican persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs). The study was conducted from the perspective of infected and affected individuals. The authors completed 64 in-depth interviews with heterosexual male and female PLWHAs, as well as with some key individuals from their social network. Following the principles of grounded theory, they carried out inductive analysis to create codes and organize central themes. The authors identified problems related to accessing HAART and found that conditions for implementing recommendations made in the international literature to improve adherence are poor. The findings highlight the importance of social factors, such as health care system irregularities, ineffective physician-patient communication, and availability of family and other sources of social support such as self-help groups for PLWHAs' access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy in Mexico."
4403,0.004,4.0000,"The successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a combination of potent antiretroviral agents, including protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, has impacted positively on morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. Over time, HAART has been associated with a number of metabolic and anthropometric abnormalities, including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance as well as subcutaneous fat loss and abdominal obesity, potentially contributing to cardiovascular risk. Recent studies have more firmly established that both HIV infection and HAART might increase the risk of clinical cardiovascular events. Furthermore, whereas HIV/HAART is associated with multiple aspects of endocrine dysfunction, there has been less focus on bone disease, although some studies indicate a higher prevalence of osteoporosis among HIV-positive subjects compared to HIV-negative controls. The relationship between bone and fat metabolism under HIV-positive conditions deserves further attention, and available data suggest the possibility of an intriguing connection. In the future, an increasing population of aging HIV-positive patients with a spectrum of antiretroviral therapies and accumulation of endocrine abnormalities and conventional cardiovascular risk factors will present preventive and therapeutic challenges to our health-care system."
9637,0.004,4.0000,"Since 1996, AIDS has declined in the Italian population, but cases in foreign patients, including both recent immigrants and long-term residents, have increased from 3.9% in 1995-1996 to 15.4% in 2001-2002. This increase can only be partly explained by a higher migratory flow and might reflect a delayed access to health facilities and to antiretroviral therapy in migrants. We performed a survey for the year 2003 of HIV-infected immigrants to Italy from countries outside the European Union to verify which factors might influence a lack of access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Italian centers of infectious diseases were requested to send sociodemographic and clinical data of HIV-infected immigrant patients. A total of 553 HIV-infected immigrants (49.9% women) were evaluated, representing 6.5% of all HIV-infected patients from these centers. The mean duration of residency in Italy was 6.6 +/- 5.0 years. The country of origin was Africa (64.5%), North and South America (24.2%), Eastern Europe (7.0%), and Asia (3.8%). A total of 407 of 553 patients (73.6%) were taking antiretroviral drugs at the time of screening. Females presented a younger age (p = 0.001), a lower frequency of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stage B/C (p = 0.008) and a more frequent heterosexual exposure to HIV (p < 0.001), while no differences were observed for time of first positive serology (p = 0.7). CD4 cell count (p = 0.9) and log plasma HIV-RNA (p = 0.1). Characteristics of HAART patients were compared to those of nontreated patients, despite a CD4 cell count less than 350 cells/mm(3). No significant difference was found for gender, country of origin, risk factor, and years of Italian residence, while legal immigrants (p = 0.018) and registered in the National Health Service (p = 0.014) were significantly more likely to receive HAART compared to illegal immigrants."
5080,0.004,4.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and treatment updates include screening recommendations, fourth-generation testing, preexposure prophylaxis, and a paradigm shift; treatment is prevention. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends routine HIV screening in persons 15 to 65 years of age, regardless of risk. Fourth-generation testing is replacing the Western blot and can identify those with acute HIV infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test; however, there are concerns about reduced sensitivity, possible misinterpretation of results, potential for less effective counseling, and possible cost barriers. Preexposure prophylaxis (effective in select high-risk adult populations) is the combination of safer sex practices and continuous primary care prevention services, plus combination antiretroviral therapy. Concerns for preexposure prophylaxis include the necessity of strict medication adherence, limited use among high-risk populations, and community misconceptions of appropriate use. Evidence supports combination antiretroviral therapy as prevention for acute HIV infection, thus lowering community viral loads. Evidence has increased supporting combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment at any CD4 cell count. Resistance testing should guide therapy in all patients on entry into care. Within two weeks of diagnosis of most opportunistic infections, combination antiretroviral therapy should be started; patients with tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis require special considerations."
5110,0.004,4.0000,"Liver-related mortality is increased in the setting of HIV-hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection. However, interactions between HIV and HBV to explain this observation have not been described. We hypothesized that HIV infection of hepatocytes directly affects the life cycle of HBV. We infected human hepatic cell lines expressing HBV (Hep3B and AD38 cells) or not expressing HBV (Huh7, HepG2, and AD43 cells) with laboratory strains of HIV (NL4-3 and AD8), as well as a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-pseudotyped HIV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Following HIV infection with NL4-3 or AD8 in hepatic cell lines, we observed a significant increase in HIV reverse transcriptase activity which was infectious. Despite no detection of surface CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 by flow cytometry, AD8 infection of AD38 cells was inhibited by maraviroc and NL4-3 was inhibited by AMD3100, demonstrating that HIV enters AD38 hepatic cell lines via CCR5 or CXCR4. High-level infection of AD38 cells (50%) was achieved using VSV-pseudotyped HIV. Coinfection of the AD38 cell line with HIV did not alter the HBV DNA amount or species as determined by Southern blotting or nucleic acid signal amplification. However, coinfection with HIV was associated with a significant increase in intracellular HBsAg when measured by Western blotting, quantitative HBsAg, and fluorescence microscopy. We conclude that HIV infection of HBV-infected hepatic cell lines significantly increased intracellular HBsAg but not HBV DNA synthesis and that increased intrahepatic HBsAg secondary to direct infection by HIV may contribute to accelerated liver disease in HIV-HBV-coinfected individuals."
2526,0.004,4.0000,"Defective hepatitis B virus DNA (dDNA) is reverse-transcribed from spliced hepatitis B virus (HBV) pregenomic messenger RNA (pgRNA) and has been identified in patients with chronic HBV (CH-B). The major 2.2-kb spliced pgRNA encodes a novel HBV gene product, the hepatitis B splice protein (HBSP) via a deletion and frame shift within the polymerase. Although spliced RNA and HBSP expression have been associated with increased HBV DNA levels and liver fibrosis, the role of dDNA in HBV-associated disease is largely undefined. Our aims were to (1) compare the relative proportions of dDNA (% dDNA) in a range of HBV-infected serum samples, including patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV coinfection and HBV-monoinfected persons with differing severities of liver disease, and (2) determine the effect of mutations associated with drug resistance on defective DNA production. Defective DNA was detected in 90% of persons with CH-B. There was no significant difference in the relative abundance of dDNA between the monoinfected and HIV/HBV-coinfected groups. We also found no association between the % dDNA and alanine aminotransferase, hepatitis B e antigen status, HBV DNA levels, fibrosis levels, compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis, genotype, or drug treatment. However, the % dDNA was significantly lower in individuals infected with lamivudine-resistant (LMV-R) HBV compared with wild-type HBV (P < 0.0001), indicating that antiviral drug resistance alters the balance between defective and genomic length DNA in circulation. Experiments in vitro using HBV encoding LMV-R mutations confirmed these results."
7851,0.004,4.0000,"A 33-year-old Hispanic woman with newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a CD4 T-lymphocyte count of 2, viral load of 730,000 copies/mL, candidal esophagitis, seizure disorder, a history of bacterial pneumonia, and recent weight loss was admitted with tonic clonic seizure. On admission, her vital signs were: pulse of 88, respiration rate of 18, temperature of 37.7 degrees C, and blood pressure of 126/76. Her only medication was phenytoin. On examination, the patient was found to have multiple umbilicated papules on her face, as well as painful, erythematous, large, punched-out ulcers on the nose, face, trunk, and extremities of 3 months' duration (Fig. 1). The borders of the ulcers were irregular, raised, boggy, and undermined, while the base contained hemorrhagic exudate partially covered with necrotic eschar. The largest ulcer on the left mandible was 4 cm in diameter. The oral cavity was clear. Because of her subtherapeutic phenytoin level, the medication dose was adjusted, and she was empirically treated with Unasyn for presumptive bacterial infection. Chest radiograph and head computed tomography (CT) scan were within normal limits. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear was negative. Serologic studies, including Histoplasma antibodies, toxoplasmosis immunoglobulin M (IgM), rapid plasma reagin (RPR), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies were all negative. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was within normal limits without the presence of cryptococcal antigen. Blood and cerebrospinal cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were all negative. Viral culture from one of the lesions was also negative. The analysis of her complete blood count showed: white blood count, 2300/microl; hemoglobin, 8.5 g/dL; hematocrit, 25.7%; and platelets, 114,000/microl. Two days after admission, the dermatology service was asked to evaluate the patient. Although the umbilicated papules on the patient's face resembled lesions of molluscum contagiosum, other infectious processes considered in the differential diagnosis included histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and Penicillium marnefei. In addition, the morphology of the ulcers, particularly that on the left mandible, resembled lesions of pyoderma gangrenosum. A skin biopsy was performed on an ulcer on the chest. Histopathologic examination revealed granulomatous dermatitis with multiple budding yeast forms, predominantly within histiocytes, with few organisms residing extracellularly. Methenamine silver stain confirmed the presence of 2-4 microm fungal spores suggestive of Histoplasma capsulatum (Fig. 2). Because of the patient's deteriorating condition, intravenous amphotericin B was initiated after tissue culture was obtained. Within the first week of treatment, the skin lesions started to resolve. Histoplasma capsulatum was later isolated by culture, confirming the diagnosis. The patient was continued on amphotericin B for a total of 10 weeks, and was started on lamivudine, stavudine, and nelfinavir for her HIV infection during hospitalization. After amphotericin B therapy, the patient was placed on life-long suppressive therapy with itraconazole. Follow-up at 9 months after the initial presentation revealed no evidence of relapse of histoplasmosis."
5669,0.004,4.0000,"The demand for dental treatment by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals is rising. Some professionals are still reluctant to treat these patients, despite the extremely low likelihood of professional transmission, which increases only in patients with a very elevated viral load. The complications rate after dental intervention is very low, even in patients with considerable immunologic deterioration. The dentist should pay special attention to the general clinical situation and immunologic and HIV virologic status of the seropositive patient, and to the presence of hemostasis alterations or of other concomitant diseases. Antiretroviral or any other drug treatments must also be recorded, in order to avoid possible interactions with clinician-prescribed drugs. Tooth extraction is the most common dental treatment and requires no antibiotic therapy except in cases of neutropenia or severe immunosuppression. Other dental treatments do not require special precautions, and the complications index among these patients is similar to that among the uninfected patient population. With this background, there is a need to make the clinician-in-training aware of the importance of regular dental health checkups as part of the health care routine of HIV-infected patients and to familiarize the clinician with their management, while not disregarding the unquestionable requirement to carry out the general and specific prevention measures to be adopted in all cases."
2301,0.004,4.0000,"Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can be successfully treated using nucleos(t)ide analogs (NA), but drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants frequently arise, leading to treatment failure and progression to liver disease. There has been much research into the mechanisms of resistance to NA and selection of these mutants. Five NA have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of CHB; it is unlikely that any more NA will be developed in the near future, so it is important to better understand mechanisms of cross-resistance (when a mutation that mediates resistance to one NA also confers resistance to another) and design more effective therapeutic strategies for these 5 agents. The genes that encode the polymerase and envelope proteins of HBV overlap, so resistance mutations in polymerase usually affect the hepatitis B surface antigen; these alterations affect infectivity, vaccine efficacy, pathogenesis of liver disease, and transmission throughout the population. Associations between HBV genotype and resistance phenotype have allowed cross-resistance profiles to be determined for many commonly detected mutants, so genotyping assays can be used to adapt therapy. Patients that experience virologic breakthrough or partial response to their primary therapy can often be successfully treated with a second NA, if this drug is given at early stages of these events. However, best strategies for preventing NA resistance include first-line use of the most potent antivirals with a high barrier to resistance. It is important to continue basic research into HBV replication and pathogenic mechanisms to identify new therapeutic targets, develop novel antiviral agents, design combination therapies that prevent drug resistance, and decrease the incidence of complications of CHB."
4393,0.004,4.0000,"We investigated the prevalence of HIV-1-associated transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in Victoria from the time of first availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Drug resistance genotyping was performed on virus present in blood samples collected from individuals with serologically confirmed primary infection, between 1996 and 2007. The significance of any mutations detected was interpreted according to a standardised list of drug resistance mutations. The main outcomes measured were the prevalence by year of TDR to any antiretroviral drug class, the numbers of infected individuals with TDR involving multiple drug classes, and the resistance mutations implicated in all cases. There was an average annual prevalence of TDR of 16%, predominantly associated with nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors and most commonly occurring at codons 41, 103 and 215 in the RT. The prevalence of thymidine-associated mutations remained high throughout the period of study. While mutations known to cause resistance to protease inhibitors were uncommon, they were present in several individuals infected with virus resistant to multiple drug classes. The prevalence of TDR in Victoria is similar to geographical locations outside Australia where HIV-specific drug treatment is widely available. Primary infection with drug resistant HIV is a future treatment issue for the individual patient and for the wider population at risk of infection. At this time TDR shows no sign of waning and our data support recent treatment guidelines recommending baseline testing for TDR before therapy is initiated."
2102,0.004,4.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive individuals who adhere to their antiretroviral (ARV) regimens are more likely to achieve suppressed HIV viral load and improved immunologic response; however, for most patients, medication adherence remains a challenge. Prior studies have shown that clinical pharmacists contribute to the management of HIV-infected patients; but due to variability in clinical responsibilities and study limitations, their value has not been fully realized. The objective of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes of an HIV clinical pharmacist's interventions at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, who utilizes medication expertise to provide recommendations for ARV regimen changes. The pharmacist suggests new ARV regimens in order to attain virologic suppression, improve immunologic response, or minimize ARV adverse effects, while aiming to optimize patients' adherence by decreasing pill burden and/or dosing frequency. This retrospective study assessed the effectiveness of the pharmacist's interventions that occurred between 11 September 2006 and 30 September 2008 on pill burden, dosing frequency, and medication adherence. Additionally, CD4+ cell count and HIV viral load pre- and post-intervention were evaluated. Medication adherence was assessed utilizing electronic pharmacy refill records and calculated based on the formula: [(pills dispensed/pills prescribed per day)/days between refills] x 100. From a cohort of 75 patients, mean daily pill quantity and dosing frequency decreased from 7.2 pills/day and 2.0 times/day in the control phase to 5.4 pills/day and 1.5 times/day in the study phase, respectively ( p < 0.001). Medication adherence increased from a mean of 81% in the control phase to 89% in the study phase ( p = 0.003). Clinical outcomes measured by CD4+cell count and CD4% were statistically improved and more individuals achieved undetectable HIV viral loads postintervention ( p < 0.001). In conclusion, HIV clinical pharmacists may play an important role in reducing pill burden and dosing frequency, increasing medication adherence, and improving clinical outcomes."
3397,0.004,4.0000,"Highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proven remarkably effective for prolonging the life of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, while most HAART agents are safe, many have the potential to cause liver toxicity. Physicians must therefore consider the possibility of drug-induced liver injury in the management of HIV-infected patients, especially those with certain risk factors such as coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), female gender, alcohol abuse, older age, or obesity. Understanding how, when, and why drug-related liver damage occurs is key to managing these patients safely and effectively. Knowledge of HAART-related liver effects will help ensure that patients receive the most benefit with the least toxicity from any given drug regimen. As more information about the mechanisms of drug related liver injury is known, clinicians will be better able to tailor therapies to suit individual situations, resulting in greater patient safety and outcomes."
7540,0.004,4.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The likelihood of developing CHB is related to the age at which infection is acquired; the risk being lowest in adults and >90% in neonates whose mothers are hepatitis B e antigen positive. Treatment of CHB infection aims to clear HBV DNA and prevent the development of complications. There are currently seven drugs available for the treatment of CHB: five nucleos(t)ide analogues and two interferon-based therapies. Long-term treatment is often required, and the decision to treat is based on clinical assessment including the phase of CHB infection and the presence and extent of liver damage. A safe and effective HBV vaccine has been available since the early 1980s. Vaccination plays a central role in HBV prevention strategies worldwide, and a decline in the incidence and prevalence of HBV infection following the introduction of universal HBV vaccination programmes has been observed in many countries including the USA and parts of South East Asia and Europe. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with HBV vaccine +/- hepatitis B immunoglobulin is highly effective in preventing mother to child transmission and in preventing transmission following sharps injuries, sexual contact and other exposures to infected blood and body fluids. Transmission of HBV in the health care setting has become an increasingly rare event in developed nations. However, it remains a significant risk in developing countries reflecting the higher prevalence of CHB, limited access to HBV vaccination and PEP and a lack of adherence to standard infection control precautions."
8329,0.004,4.0000,"The duration of HIV infection is usually unknown for most patients entering into HIV care. Data on the frequency at which resistance mutations are detected in these patients are needed to support practical guidance on the use of resistance testing in this clinical situation. Furthermore, little is known about HIV subtype diversity in much of the United States. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence of drug resistance mutations and nonsubtype B strains of HIV among antiretroviral-naïve individuals presenting for HIV care in New York State between September 2000 and January 2004. Sequences were obtained using a commercial HIV genotyping assay. Seventeen of 151 subjects (11.3%; 95% confidence interval 7.2%-17.3%) had at least one drug-resistance mutation, including 5 subjects with fewer than 200 CD4(+) T cells, indicative of advanced infection. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor resistance mutations were detected in 6.6%, 5.3%, and 0.7% of subjects, respectively. Subjects from New York City-based clinics were less likely to have resistant virus than subjects from clinics elsewhere in New York State. Nonsubtype B strains of HIV were detected in 9 (6.0%) individuals and were associated with heterosexual contact. Two nonsubtype B strains from this cohort also carried drug-resistance mutations. These data indicate that drug-resistant virus is frequently detected in antiretroviral-naïve individuals entering HIV care in New York State. Furthermore, a diverse set of nonsubtype B strains were identified and evidence suggests that nonsubtype B strains, including those carrying drug-resistance mutations, are being transmitted in New York State."
2416,0.004,4.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) constitute the main burden of infectious disease in resource-limited countries. In the individual host, the two pathogens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV, potentiate one another, accelerating the deterioration of immunological functions. In high-burden settings, HIV coinfection is the most important risk factor for developing active TB, which increases the susceptibility to primary infection or reinfection and also the risk of TB reactivation for patients with latent TB. M. tuberculosis infection also has a negative impact on the immune response to HIV, accelerating the progression from HIV infection to AIDS. The clinical management of HIV-associated TB includes the integration of effective anti-TB treatment, use of concurrent antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevention of HIV-related comorbidities, management of drug cytotoxicity, and prevention/treatment of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

4794,0.004,4.0000,"Treatment strategies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive active injecting drug users (IDUs) must take into account their lifestyles, that often result in low adherence to therapy. The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) offer simpler treatment regimens, but the appearance of drug resistance during treatment failure may cause high levels of cross-resistance to all NNRTIs. We adopted a combination therapy of two NRTIs and nevirapine (NVP) for treatment of IDU patients to evaluate its feasibility in such patients. From October 1998 to December 1999, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 80 IDUs on this regimen were collected. Fisher's exact test, Kaplan Meier method, and Cox model were used for statistical analysis. Overall, 20 IDUs discontinued the treatment because of side effects and 20 IDUs experienced treatment failure. Considering the treatment failure as an end point, 55.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.9%-72.6%) of patients was still undergoing treatment after 12 months compared to 44.6% (31.8%-58.6%) when discontinuation was also taken into account. An increasing trend over time was observed in the CD4+ lymphocyte count, among failing and nonfailing IDUs. By multivariate analysis, baseline HIV-RNA, treatment breaks and low adherence and active injecting drug use turned out to be significantly associated with treatment failure. Our results show that continuing injecting drug use and treatment breaks are the main factors that can lead to treatment failure in IDUs and easily to NNRTI class resistance."
6893,0.004,4.0000,"Lamivudine is a major drug approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Emergence of drug-resistant mutants with amino acid substitutions in the YMDD motif is a well-documented problem during long-term lamivudine therapy. Here we report a novel lamivudine-resistant strain of HBV with an intact YMDD motif, which included an amino acid substitution, rtA181T, in the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of HBV polymerase. The substitution also induced a unique amino acid substitution (W172L) in the overlapping hepatitis B surface (HBs) protein. The YMDD mutant strains were not detected even by using the sensitive peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR clamping method. The detected nucleotide substitution was accompanied by the emergence of an additional nucleotide substitution that induced amino acid change (S331C) in the spacer domain. The rtA181T mutant strain displayed a threefold decrease in susceptibility to lamivudine in in vitro experiments in comparison with the wild type. In vivo analysis using human hepatocyte-chimeric mice confirmed the resistance of this mutant strain to lamivudine. We developed a method to detect this novel rtA181T mutation and a previously reported rtA181T mutation with the HBs stop codon using restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR and identified one patient with the latter pattern among 40 patients with lamivudine resistance. In conclusion, although the incidence is not high, we have to be careful regarding the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutant strains with intact YMDD motif."
6737,0.003,3.0000,"The Tat protein of HIV is produced early after infection and it is essential for viral replication and transmission. Tat is released by infected lymphocytes and is detected in the serum of HIV-infected patients. Extracellular Tat enters cells, where promotes HIV replication. Several studies suggest that humoral and cellular anti-Tat immunity have a protective role and may control disease progression. Of importance, Tat is conserved in its immunogenic regions among all viral subtypes except O subtype. Thus, the immunization with Tat cannot block virus entry but might block HIV replication and progression to disease. To test this hypothesis, monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were immunized with a biologically active Tat protein. Tat was non toxic and induced specific humoral and cellular immune responses. High titers of anti-Tat antibodies capable of neutralizing Tat activity and the in vitro infection with the SHIV89.6P, Tat-specific proliferation, CTLs, TNFalpha production and skin tests were detected in the vaccinated monkeys. Most importantly, upon challenge with the highly pathogenic SHIV89.6P (10 MID50, i.v.), 5/7 of the vaccinated monkeys showed no signs of infection nor CD4+-T cell decline over a 19 months of follow-up, whereas 3/3 controls were highly infected. Thus, a Tat-vaccine is capable of controlling the acute phase of infection in nonhuman primates. These data open new avenues for the development of an AIDS vaccine."
2192,0.003,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are thought to play a major role in the immune response to HIV infection. The HIV-specific CTL response is much stronger than previously documented in an infectious disease, yet estimates of CTL frequency derived from limiting-dilution analysis (LDA) are relatively low and comparable to other viral infections. Here we show that individual CTL clones specific for peptides from HIV gag and pol gene products are present at high levels in the peripheral blood of three infected patients and that individual CTL clones may represent between 0.2% and 1% of T cells. Previous LDA in one donor had shown a frequency of CTL precursors of 1/8000, suggesting that LDA may underestimate CTL effector frequency. In some donors individual CTL clones persisted in vivo for at least 5 years. In contrast, in one patient there was a switch in CTL usage suggesting that different populations of CTLs can be recruited during infection. These data imply strong stimulation of CTLs, potentially leading some clones to exhaustion."
1672,0.003,3.0000,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was first recognized as a new disease in 1981 because of the unusual association of Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in young men. The skin remains one of the most important clinical markers for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, now recognized as the end stage of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Indeed, an urticarial viral exanthem appearing during seroconversion may allow early identification of newly infected individuals who might benefit from administration of antiviral therapy during plasma viremia. The ""asymptomatic HIV infection"" is often accompanied by multiple skin complaints, which commonly include xerosis, pruritus, psoriasis/seborrheic dermatitis, and pruritic papular eruptions, the cause of which remains controversial. Psoriasis and Kaposi's sarcoma lesions share features including angiogenesis, dermal dendrocytes infected with HIV, and epidermal hyperproliferation, and are manifested by mice transgenic for HIV provirus or Tat-ltr. Changes in the immune system including T-cell function, antigen response, and shifting cytokine expression as well as a propensity for autoimmune reactions must underlie the skin immunodysfunction occurring in the setting of HIV infection. One of the most unsettling controversies suggested by in vitro data is that ultraviolet light, an effective therapy for HIV-related skin disorders, may actually activate the virus."

Results from the 72 participants showed no protease inhibitor and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated mutations. One participant (1.4%, 95% CI: 0.04-7.5%) had two nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations (G190E and P225H). HIV-1 subtype frequencies were A 22 (30.6%), D 38 (52.8%), and C 1 (1.4%); 11 (15.3%) were A/D unique recombinant forms. Seven years after the scale up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a rural clinical cohort in Uganda, the prevalence of TDR among recently HIV-1-infected individuals was low at 1.4%. Since our findings from an HIV study cohort may not be generalizable to the general population, routine TDR surveys in specific populations may be necessary to inform policy on the magnitude and prevention strategies of TDR."

In our study we investigated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the first exon and promoter region of the mannose-binding lectin gene 2 (MBL2) situated on chromosome 10, with susceptibility to HBV infection. One-hundred and two patients infected with HBV were included in this study, and 232 uninfected individuals were used as healthy controls. Genotyping of the first exon (alleles A/O) was performed using a melting temperature assay. Genotyping of the promoter region (-550 H/L; -221 Y/X) was performed using the Taqman PCR technique. In the HBV-infected group we found a significantly increased frequency of haplotypes associated with low serum MBL. Our findings may indicate that MBL has a protective role against HBV infection in the studied population."
7701,0.003,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is the responsible agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a multi system disorder including the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is an immunological privileged site providing a sanctuary and reservoir for HIV-1. Monocytes derived macrophages (MDM) and microglia play a critical role in the development of HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Although the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a strong reduction of HAD incidence, the prevalence of minor HIV-1 associated cognitive impairment appears rising among AIDS patients. Various factors including toxicity, insurgence of drug resistance and sometimes limited access to HAART, contribute to this phenomenon. Independent evolution of drug resistance mutations in several areas of the CNS may emerge as consequence of incomplete suppression of HIV-1, probably related to poor penetration of antiretroviral drugs into CNS. The emergence of resistant virus in the CNS may considerable influence the outcome of neurological disease and also the reseeding of HIV-1 in the systemic circulation upon failure of therapy. In this review, we outline the current state of knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of CNS injury in HIV-1 infection and will focus on the effects of HAART on CNS."
8537,0.003,3.0000,"It is estimated that, in the United States and Europe, 15-30% of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Among these patients, approximately 80% are intravenous drug users (IVDU), 71% are hemophiliacs, and around 20% are homosexual/bi-sexual men. HIV infection accelerates the natural history of HCV infection. On the contrary, highly active antiretroviral therapy reduces the rate of mortality due to liver disease by immune restoration. Since having HIV implies being at risk also for HCV as both infections can be acquired in similar ways, all individuals with the former should be screened for the latter. Loss of antibodies against HCV in HIV-seropositive IVDU has been shown. Thus, quantitative tests determining HCV-RNA levels in blood are currently being employed for diagnosis confirmation in case of an obvious ''risk group''. Since HIV can progress more rapidly than HCV, it may be preferable to treat HIV first. The 2007 recommendations from HCV-HIV International Panel indicate current treatment of HCV in coinfected patients with pegylated formulation of interferon at standard doses plus weight based ribavirin. The treatment duration should be evaluated on the basis of HCV genotype. Liver transplantation is a most debated issue when dealing with HCV/HIV coinfected subjects. Mortality among HIV-infected liver transplant recipients is similar to that of age and race-matched HIV-negative controls. The present concise review attempts to highlight on the current clinical situation on HIV/HCV coinfection."
1939,0.003,3.0000,"Improving health literacy is a necessary intervention for people with chronic health conditions to ensure adherence with long or life therapies and increase participation in self-care. While adherence is a multifactorial process, increasing health literacy among HIV-infected patients at all stages of living with HIV has been shown to improve treatment outcomes. In the era of rapid scale up of HIV care and treatment, little has been done to evaluate the utility of information, education, and communication (IEC) materials for increasing patient health literacy and how patients perceive such materials. Four patient-oriented print IEC brochures in Kiswahili were designed to be read at the clinic waiting areas and also carried home by patients to supplement the knowledge received from routine counselling during clinic visits. Brochures detail antiretroviral therapy and address common myths, side effects, types and management of opportunistic infections, and prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV. We conducted focus group discussions with HIV-infected patients to explore patient perceptions of IEC materials in the urban congested HIV care setting of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Groups of participants were recruited from eight public PEPFAR-supported HIV care and treatment centres in the city (N = 50). In this paper we present the results of those focus group discussions and introduce the print IEC materials as a pilot intervention in a Kiswahili-speaking setting where a need for additional health literacy exists. Further evaluation of these materials will follow as the data becomes available."
8643,0.003,3.0000,"Nelfinavir mesylate (formerly AG1343) is a potent and selective, nonpeptidic inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease that was discovered by protein structure-based design methodologies. We evaluated the antiviral and cytotoxic effects of two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the clinically approved antiretroviral therapeutics zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), dideoxycytidine (ddC; zalcitabine), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), indinavir, saquinavir, and ritonavir and a three-drug combination of nelfinavir with ZDV and 3TC against an acute HIV-1 strain RF infection of CEM-SS cells in vitro. Quantitative assessment of drug interaction was evaluated by a universal response surface approach (W. R. Greco, G. Bravo, and J. C. Parsons, Pharm. Rev. 47:331-385, 1995) and by the method of M. N. Prichard and C. Shipman (Antiviral Res. 14:181-206, 1990). Both analytical methods yielded similar results and showed that the two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the reverse transcriptase inhibitors ZDV, 3TC, ddI, d4T, and ddC and the three-drug combination with ZDV and 3TC resulted in additive to statistically significant synergistic interactions. In a similar manner, the combination of nelfinavir with the three protease inhibitors resulted in additive (ritonavir and saquinavir) to slightly antagonistic (indinavir) interactions. In all combinations, minimal cellular cytotoxicity was observed with any drug alone and in combination. These results suggest that administration of combinations of the appropriate doses of nelfinavir with other currently approved antiretroviral therapeutic agents in vivo may result in enhanced antiviral activity with no associated increase in cellular cytotoxicity."
9884,0.003,3.0000,"The prevalence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among incarcerated individuals in the United States is estimated to be between 12% and 31%. HCV treatment during incarceration is an attractive option because of improved access to health care and directly observed therapy. We compared incarcerated and nonincarcerated HCV-infected patients evaluated for treatment at a single academic center between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2007. During this period, 521 nonincarcerated and 388 incarcerated patients were evaluated for HCV treatment. Three hundred and nineteen (61.2%) nonincarcerated patients and 234 (60.3%) incarcerated patients underwent treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Incarcerated patients were more likely to be male, African-American race, and have a history of alcohol or intravenous drug use. Treated incarcerated patients were less likely to have genotype 1 virus and were less likely to have undergone previous treatment. There was a similar prevalence of coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in both groups. A sustained viral response (SVR) was achieved in 97 (42.9%) incarcerated patients, compared to 115 (38.0%) nonincarcerated patients (P = 0.304). Both groups had a similar proportion of patients that completed a full treatment course. Stepwise logistic regression was conducted, and the final model included full treatment course, non-genotype 1 virus, younger age at treatment start, and negative HIV status. Incarceration status was not a significant predictor when added to this model (P = 0.075)."
5450,0.003,3.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global major health problem. Currently, 10 genotypes (A-J) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are identified based on the nucleic acid sequence heterogeneity, and these genotypes have been shown to have distinct geographic distribution. Reports of the previous studies indicated that the genotype D is the predominant type among hepatitis B patients in different regions of Turkey. However, recent studies indicated that other HBV genotypes are also seen with an increasing rate. Although epidemiological and clinical information on genotype E infection is currently limited, it is known that genotype E infection is common in West and Central Africa. In this report, the first case of HBV genotype E infection in Turkey was presented. A 22-year-old Nigerian male employee who resided in Manisa for five years was admitted to Celal Bayar University Hospital Manisa, Turkey, for his routine check-up. Since HBsAg was found positive, other HBV markers were tested with a repeated serum sample. Laboratory findings were as follows; HBsAg (+), anti-HBs (-), HBeAg (-), anti-HBe (+), anti-HBc (+), anti-HCV (-), anti-HIV (-), ALT: 44 U/L and AST: 45 U/L. HBV-DNA level was detected as 700 IU/ml by real-time PCR (Artus HBV QS RGQ Qiagen, Germany). HBV-DNA isolated from the serum sample of the patient was amplified by PCR and polymerase gene segment of HBV was directly sequenced. UPGMA method was used for phylogenetic analysis and Inno-LIPA HBV genotyping method (Innogenetics, Belgium) was performed to determine multiple HBV genotype infection. On the basis of those methods the genotype of the virus was identified as genotype E. The partial sequences of the HBV polymerase gene were loaded to the international DNA data bank (GenBank) for contribution to the global HBV surveillance. This report emphasized that besides genotype D the other HBV genotypes could be found in Turkey. Since the patient was an inactive HBsAg carrier before his residence in Turkey, this case was regarded as an imported HBV genotype E case. In conclusion, detection of different HBV genotypes, their epidemiology and molecular characteristics are important for both national and global HBV surveillance and better clinical approach. "
3134,0.003,3.0000,"As a result of shared modes of transmission, chronic hepatitis C infection is common in HIV-infected patients, particularly among those who have used injection drugs as well as men who have sex with men (MSMs). In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, HCV infection has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Over the last decade, treatment with peginterferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) has been recommended for coinfected patients who are at the greatest risk for liver disease; however, the effectiveness of HCV treatment in this population has been disappointing. Challenges to the use of HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, patients with HIV/HCV coinfection include the potential for interactions between different drugs, addition of drug toxicities, and the need for therapy with PEG-IFN. Despite these challenges, limited data indicate that telaprevir and boceprevir given in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV increase the rate of viral suppression in coinfected patients with manageable toxicity and drug-drug interaction profile. Accordingly, these agents may be recommended for HCV treatment in carefully selected HIV-infected persons."
3820,0.003,3.0000,"Multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains with reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations at codons A62-->V, V75-->I, F77-->L, F116-->Y, and Q151-->M have been reported in patients receiving combination therapy with zidovudine (AZT) and didanosine (ddI). Infectious clones with each mutation alone, all five mutations together, and various combinations of mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation Q151-->M conferred partial resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine, whereas a combination of four mutations conferred increased resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine. The positions of residues 75, 77, and 151 in the three-dimensional crystal structure of HIV-1 RT suggest that these residues may affect the ability of the enzyme to discriminate between deoxynucleoside triphosphates and nucleoside analog RT inhibitors. Replication experiments showed that clones with mutation F77-->L but without V75-->I (HIV-1(77), HIV-1(77,151), and HIV-1(77,116,151) had attenuated growth compared with that of the original HIV-1NL4-3 strain and strains containing mutations at both positions 75 and 77 (HIV-1(75,77,151) and HIV-1(75,77,116,15)). Sequence analysis of viral RNA and proviral DNA from several patients indicated that RT mutations developed in a sequential and cumulative pattern over the course of a 2- to 4-year observation period. The present results suggest that drug resistance and viral replicative capacity both may play a role in selection of HIV-1 RT mutations."
33,0.003,3.0000,"We report on the frequency of genetic mutations associated with drug resistance in antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from Martinique (French West Indies), where zidovudine (ZDV) has been available since 1987 and where combination therapy developed simultaneously with its use in continental France. Genotypic resistance was studied in plasma HIV RNA from samples collected between 1988 and 1998 from 70 antiretroviral-naive study subjects, half presenting with either primary infection or documented seroconversion. A line probe assay (LIPA) was used to detect substitutions on the reverse transcriptase (RT) codons 41, 69, 70, 74, 184, and 215. Direct sequencing was used to complete the data for RT codons which were uninterpretable by LIPA. Of these patients, 17 harbored mutated viruses with one or more mutations in the RT gene codons analyzed. ZDV resistance mutations T215Y/F, M41L, and K70R were found in 2, 5, and 12 individuals, respectively. Mutant strains L74V (didanosine [ddI] and dideoxycytidine [ddC]) were detected in 3 patients and M184V (lamivudine/ddI/ddC) in 4 patients. However, pure mutant results at one or more codons of interest were observed in only 5 (7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-13%) patients, all involving ZDV resistance. One carried both mutations T215Y and M41L known to confer a high degree of phenotypic resistance to ZDV. Among a subgroup of 28 patients with a timepoint of infection after 1995, 24 [86%; approximately 95% CI, 73%-99%) presented with a wild-type pattern. The significance of the high prevalence of mixed patterns observed in drug-naive patients remains unclear. However, the frequency of primary mutant genotypes associated with high levels of drug resistance is low in Martinique and in this study we did not observe any currently increased tendency in this frequency."
5528,0.003,3.0000,"To report long-term data on safety and effectiveness of antiretroviral regimens, including nevirapine. HIV-1-infected patients who received nevirapine-based approaches for at least 4 years were identified in the databases of five centers and included in a retrospective cohort study. Data collected included plasma HIV-RNA (viral load) and CD4+ T-cell counts, lipid and liver function tests, at baseline, 2-year and > 4-year time points. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection, adverse events, and reasons for using nevirapine were also recorded. Two hundred and twenty-nine patients (139 males/90 females) were included. The mean age was 37 years (range 20-59). Most patients (n = 124; 54%) were former intravenous drug users. One hundred and thirty-five of the patients (59%) were coinfected with HCV. Median time on nevirapine was 72.6 months. The main reasons for nevirapine use included: second- or third-line therapy (39%), simplification of therapy (29%), first-line therapy (18%) and efavirenz intolerance (9%). LDL cholesterol and triglycerides decreased during the >4-year follow-up (135 mg/dl to 109 mg/dl, p = 0.04; and 216 mg/dl to 153 mg/dl, p<0.01, respectively), and HDL cholesterol increased from 48 mg/dl at baseline to 62 mg/dl (p<0.01). Liver enzymes remained without significant changes during follow-up. The reported follow-up pattern of laboratory tests was also found in the subset of HCV-coinfected patients, where men and women were compared and patients with a CD4+ cell count cut-off value of 250/mm(3) were stratified. Mean CD4+ T-cell counts increased from 439/mm(3) at baseline to 628/mm(3) at the last available visit (p<0.001). Ninety-four per cent (172 out of 184) of patients who remained on nevirapine-based therapy at last visit maintained viral load values below the limit of detection (<50 copies/ml). Throughout the follow-up nevirapine was stopped or withdrawn in 43 patients due to virological failure (n = 17), toxicity (n = 5), therapy interruption (n = 3), death (n = 2), dyslipidemia (n = 1), simplification (n = 1) or unknown reasons (n = 14). Adverse events were reported in 40 patients but none was directly attributed to nevirapine. Nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy provides sustained immunological and virological effectiveness over a more than 4-year treatment period as well as a beneficial lipid metabolic profile and a favorable safety profile, even in HCV-coinfected patients and women with CD4+ cell counts above 250/mm(3). The study data support a nevirapine-based approach as a suitable long-term strategy in the HIV-1-infected population."
6602,0.003,3.0000,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in many developing and developed nations, leading to talk of the ""twin epidemics."" The latest projections from the International Diabetes Federation suggest that 190 million people worldwide currently have type 2 diabetes. In addition, > or = 300 million people worldwide have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). These statistics represent an epidemic of major proportions--possibly the largest epidemic in human history--in terms of glucose intolerance and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk because individuals with IGT are at substantially higher risk for diabetes and CVD than are members of the general population. Along with IGT, the metabolic syndrome comprises other major CVD risk factors, including insulin resistance, central obesity, and dyslipidemia; insulin resistance has been implicated as the single most common cause of the syndrome. Although the exact prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is unknown, the syndrome is widespread among adults in developed nations, becoming more prevalent with age. Epidemiologic data suggest that in patients with schizophrenia or affective disorders, both diabetes and obesity are 1.5 to 2.0 times more prevalent than in the general population. Furthermore, because adverse effects of certain therapies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and psychiatric disorders increase the risk for developing diabetes, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome, such therapies should be carefully chosen, particularly considering CVD risk. Appropriate therapy may be determined via screening of patients for levels of fasting blood glucose and lipids, as well as other CVD risk factors, before initiating use of second-generation antipsychotic agents or highly active antiretroviral therapy."
4645,0.003,3.0000,"Among many factors that can influence vulnerability to infection and disease progression are genetic host factors together with the phenotype/genotype of the transmitting virus and the route of infection. Each of these factors alone or in combination could determine susceptibility to infection and subsequent rate of progression towards AIDS. Between host genetic factors identified and analyzed for their role in HIV-1 transmission and disease progression are polymorphisms in the genes encoding chemokine receptors and CCR5, CCR2 and SDF-1 a natural ligand for CXCR4 receptor. It has been shown that the distribution of this genetic polymorphisms and their role in the course of disease varies between different racial, ethnic and risk groups. The aim of present study was to examine the frequencies of polymorphic alleles CCR5-delta32, CCR2-64I and SDF-1-3'A and their role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) transmission in Polish population. The allelic and genotype distribution was studied in 103 HIV-1 infected patients (group HIV+) and 59 seronegative participants (group HIV-). Genotyping was done by the use of polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers and restriction fragment length polymorphism. We found higher prevalence of CCR5-delta32 mutant allele among seronegative participants (13.6%) compared with HIV-infected patients (9.7%), although this did not attain statistical significance (p = 0.29). The CCR2-64I allelic frequency was almost identical in the HIV- and HIV+ groups (12.7% vs. 12.6%; respectively; p = 0.98). In contrast, the SDF-1-3'A allelic frequency was slightly lower among seronegative participants (15.3%) compared with HIV-infected patients (16.5%), and observed difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.77). Furthermore, we found that the genotype or allelic frequencies among HIV-1 infected patients were independent on the participant's sex, age at HIV-1 infection and the transmission route. Our results showed no significant differences in the prevalence of examined alleles and genotypes between HIV-1 infected patients and seronegative participants, which indicates that in the examined population they are not influencing host susceptibility to the HIV-1 infection."
5254,0.003,3.0000,"The mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of a man (VH) homozygous for the CCR5Delta32 mutation were investigated, and coreceptors other than CCR5 used by HIV type 1 (HIV-1) isolated from this individual were identified. In contrast to previous reports, this individual's rate of disease progression was not accelerated. Homozygosity for CCR5Delta32 mutation was demonstrated by PCR and DNA sequencing (R. Biti et al., Nat. Med. 3:252-253, 1997). CCR5 surface expression was absent on T lymphocytes and macrophages. HIV was isolated by coculture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from siblings who were homozygous (VM) or wild type (WT) for the CCR5Delta32 mutation. The virus demonstrated dual tropism for infection of MT2 cell line and primary macrophages. Sequencing of the full HIV genome directly from the patient's PBMCs revealed 21 nucleotide insertions in the V1 region of gp120. The VH envelope sequence segregated apart from both the T-cell-line-adapted tropic strains NL4-3 and SF2 and M-tropic strain JRFL or YU2 by phylogenetic tree analysis. VH was shown to utilize predominantly CXCR4 for entry into T lymphocytes and macrophages by HOS.CD4 cell infection assay, direct envelope protein fusion, and inhibition by anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (12G5), SDF-1, and AMD3100. Microsatellite mapping demonstrated the separate inheritance of CXCR4 by both homozygote brothers (VH and VM). Our study demonstrates the ability of certain strains of HIV to readily use CXCR4 for infection or entry into macrophages, which is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of late-stage disease and presumably also HIV transmission."
9004,0.003,3.0000,"Hepatitis B infection (HBV) is prevalent worldwide. Overall prevalence is about 3 percent in Bangladesh. Treatments of chronic HBV infection by antiviral drugs are costly and outcome of treatment is also restricted. Therefore risk factors identification is the logical & rational approach to prevent HBV infection. This case control study aimed to find out certain risk factors related to HBV infection in children. It was conducted on patients attending the Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition and Department of Virology of BSMMU and Khidmah Hospital, Dhaka. A total of one hundred cases and one hundred suitably matched controls were studied between October 2007 to May 2009.Variables used for the purpose of the study were younger age,  use of mosquito nets, history of undergoing surgical procedures, history of taking intravenous drug and blood transfusion, maternal infection, dental procedures and abrasion during hair cut in barber shops. Chi-square test   was done to measure the level of significance. Odds ratio was calculated to correlate the disease risk. Backward conditional logistic regression was also done for multivariate analysis. The study result showed that the frequency of HBV infection among the study population was higher (62.0%) among children of 7 to 12 years age group. In younger age group (0-6 years) prevalence was 18.0%. Respondents who did not use mosquito net during sleep on a regular basis had higher risk of developing HBV infection than those who used it regularly (p value 0.028). Children who underwent surgical procedures for any reason were significantly associated with HBV infection (p value 0.005). Intravenous drug use (p value 0.001), mother to child transmission (p value 0.001) and history of abrasion during hair cut in barber shops (p value 0.04) were also identified as significant risk factors. No significant association was observed with blood transfusion (p value 0.138) and dental procedures (p value 0.315). From this study it may be concluded that irregular use of mosquito nets, history of surgical procedures, history of parenteral medication, transmission from infected mothers and abrasion during hair cut in barber shops are the probable important risk factors of HBV infection in children."
7858,0.003,3.0000,"To determine the incidence of hepatotoxicity and to investigate whether plasma concentrations of nevirapine, in addition to other risk factors, could predict hepatotoxicity during treatment with nevirapine-containing regimens, we conducted a retrospective analysis with data from 174 individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). During regular visits to the clinic, blood samples were collected for the determination of nevirapine plasma concentrations and clinical chemistry parameters including liver enzymes (LEs) and total bilirubin (TBR). Severe hepatotoxicity was defined as a grade > or =3 elevation in at least one of the tested LEs or TBR levels while on therapy. Analysis of predictive factors was focused on increases in aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) to grade > or =2. Grade > or =3 elevation developed with an incidence of 0.15 per patient year (PY); only 3.4% of the patients developed grade > or =3 values for ASAT and/or ALAT (incidence 0.03 per PY). We found that patients who use a protease inhibitor (PI) in a nevirapine-containing regimen and patients who have chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection are at a higher risk for the development of increases in ASAT and/or ALAT to grade > or =2. In contrast, the plasma concentration of nevirapine does not appear to be a predictive factor in this study population."
410,0.003,3.0000,"Two novel assays, a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay and an assay based on the 5'-nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase, were developed for screening viral variants in lamivudine-treated patients' sera containing <1,000 copies of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome per ml. Both assays were designed to detect single-nucleotide changes within the HBV DNA polymerase gene that are associated with lamivudine resistance in vitro and have been used to screen a number of patients' sera for variant virus. Results obtained with these assays and standard sequencing technology were compared with regard to throughput, ability to detect individual virus species present at low concentrations, and ability to detect, distinguish, and quantitate wild-type (wt) and HBV tyrosine methionine(552) aspartate aspartate motif variants in mixed viral populations. Unlike DNA sequencing, both assays are amenable to high-throughput screening and were shown to be able to quantitatively detect variant virus in the presence of a background of wt virus. As with DNA sequencing, both new assays incorporate a PCR amplification step and are able to detect the relatively low amounts of virus found in lamivudine-treated patients' sera. However, these assays are far less labor intensive than the DNA-sequencing techniques presently in use. Overall, the RFLP assay was more sensitive than DNA sequencing in detecting and determining the ratios of wt to variant virus. Furthermore, the RFLP assay and 5'-nuclease assay were equally sensitive in the detection of mixed viral species, but the RFLP assay was superior to the 5'-nuclease assay in the quantitation of mixed viral species. These assays should prove useful for further understanding of virological response to therapy and disease progression."
4663,0.003,3.0000,"Most studies of the medical costs of HIV infection focus on the terminal stage of this chronic illness when the patients have developed AIDS or severe HIV disease and in-patient care dominates. Data are also needed on the medical costs during the prolonged phase of HIV infection preceding severe terminal illness and the effects it may have on the provision of outpatient care. The study population was derived from a cohort study of factory workers and their spouses in Tanzania. Morbidity and outpatient health services utilization are estimated for 1832 adults who on average had been enrolled for two years and utilized the study clinic. Among those who had been enrolled at least 2 years, 50 cases (HIV+ since enrollment) and 150 control (HIV- until last visit) were selected, matched by age, sex and income level to estimate expenditure on drugs by HIV status. There was an increase in morbidity during HIV infection: the incidence of clinical diagnoses was 30% higher among HIV-positive than among HIV-negative adults (p < 0.001). HIV-infected adults also made more frequent use of the outpatient services (23% higher utilization). Estimates of essential drug costs among the subsample showed a 15% increase for HIV infected adults compared to HIV-negative adults, caused by higher use of antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs. The overall increase in morbidity, outpatient care services utilization and essential drug use due to HIV infection was limited, as HIV prevalence in this adult population was 11%. For example, the net proportion of all illness episodes attributable to HIV infection was 3.2%. Possible biases are discussed and suggest that our findings are a minimum estimate of the effect of adult HIV infection on outpatient care costs. There is a need for more studies in different settings to assess the impact of HIV infection on outpatient care in developing countries."
4320,0.003,3.0000,"Following global efforts to increase antiretroviral therapy (ART) access in Sub-Saharan Africa, ART coverage among HIV-infected Cameroonians increased from 0% in 2003 to 22% in 2014. However, the success of current HIV treatment programs depends not only on access to ART, but also on retention in care and good treatment adherence. This is necessary to achieve viral suppression, prevent virologic failure, and reduce viral transmission and HIV/AIDS-related deaths. Previous studies in Cameroon showed poor adherence, treatment interruption, and loss to follow-up among HIV+ subjects on ART, but the factors that influence ART adherence are not well known. In the current cross-sectional study, patient/self-reported questionnaires and pharmacy medication refill data were used to quantify ART adherence and determine the factors associated with increased risk of non-adherence among HIV-infected Cameroonians. We demonstrated that drug side-effects, low CD4 cell counts and higher viral loads are associated with increased risk of non-adherence, and compared to females, males were more likely to forego ART because of side effects (p<0.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that subjects with opportunistic infections (on antibiotics) had 2.42-times higher odds of having been non-adherent (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis controlling for ART regimen, age, gender, and education showed that subjects with opportunistic infections had 3.1-times higher odds of having been non-adherent (p<0.0003), with significantly longer periods of non-adherence, compared to subjects without opportunistic infections (p = 0.02). We further showed that compared to younger subjects (≤40 years), older subjects (>40 years) were less likely to be non-adherent (p<0.01) and had shorter non-adherent periods (p<0.0001). The presence of depression symptoms correlated with non-adherence to ART during antibiotic treatment (r = 0.53, p = 0.04), and was associated with lower CD4 cell counts (p = 0.04) and longer non-adherent periods (p = 0.04). Change in ART regimen was significantly associated with increased likelihood of non-adherence and increased duration of the non-adherence period. Addressing these underlying risk factors could improve ART adherence, retention in care and treatment outcomes for HIV/AIDS patients in Cameroon."

The most common regimens were 3TC + d4T + nevirapine (NVP) (54.8%), zidovudine (AZT) + 3TC + NVP (14.5%), 3TC + d4T + efavirenz (EFV) (20.1%), and AZT + 3TC + EFV (5.4%). The most common adverse events and median CD4 at time of event were rash (15.2%; CD4, 285 cells/microL) and peripheral neuropathy (9.0% and 348 cells/microL). Clinically significant anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dL) was observed in 5.4% of patients (CD4, 165 cells/microL) and hepatitis (clinical jaundice with alanine aminotransferase > 5 times upper limits of normal) in 3.5% of patients (CD4, 260 cells/microL). Women were significantly more likely to experience lactic acidosis, while men were significantly more likely to experience immune reconstitution syndrome (p < 0.05). Among the patients with 1 year of follow-up, NVP therapy was significantly associated with developing rash and d4T therapy with developing peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.05). Anemia and hepatitis often occur within 12 weeks of initiating generic HAART. Frequent and early monitoring for these toxicities is warranted in developing countries where generic HAART is increasingly available."
2193,0.003,3.0000,"Before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) represented one of the most prevalent causes of focal brain lesions in HIV-infected people. The prognosis of PCNSL was very poor, with median survival time not exceeding 2 months. Brain biopsy was the method of choice for the definitive diagnosis, but it was and remains an invasive procedure with morbidity and mortality as well as considerable costs in terms of patients' management and quality of life. The strict association between AIDS-PCNSL and Epstein-Barr virus led to the suggestion that EBV DNA in cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) might serve as a diagnostic marker, reducing the time required for diagnosis and allowing a minimally invasive approach. The clinical usefulness of this methodology has been largely demonstrated through clinical practice. After the introduction of HAART in clinical practice, a survival benefit has been observed for most persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated opportunistic infections and cancers. In particular, for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a higher likelihood of response to chemotherapy as well as a longer survival has been found as a consequence of the use of combined antiretroviral therapy. Although larger studies did not show significant changes in survival of HIV-infected patients with PCNSL in the era of HAART, small case series and anecdotal reports showed the benefit of HAART in the treatment of PCNSL. Nevertheless, these patients' survival still remains very poor and it could be hypothesized that, other than specific cancer prognostic determinants and severe immunodeficiency, viral pathogenesis as well as EBV-specific immunologic dysfunction may be responsible."
1434,0.003,3.0000,"Patients with resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection undergoing chemo- or immunosuppressive therapy are at potential risk for HBV reactivation. To determine whether the host immune response contributes to liver injury, we performed an immunological analysis of a patient with HBV reactivation. Consistent with the detection of HBV DNA in the sera, the number of polyclonal HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) gradually increased; however, the number of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) decreased. The interaction between HBV-specific CTLs and CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg is an important determinant of liver injury during HBV reactivation. Therefore, monitoring the number of these cells might be a useful modality for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis resulting from HBV reactivation. "
2343,0.003,3.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in chronic hepatitis C patient. However, its significance and consequences are still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of occult HBV among HCV chronic carriers in France and to assess its impact on liver histology and response to antiviral therapy. To this end a cohort of 203 patients with chronic hepatitis C without hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has been examined. Serum HBV-DNA was detected using a highly sensitive PCR with primers located in the S and X genes. HBV viraemia levels were further determined by real-time PCR. Results showed that 47 of 203 (23%) patients had occult HBV infection with a low HBV load (10(2)-10(4) copies/ml) but significantly higher HCV-RNA titers (P < 0.05). No significant difference in age, gender, serum ALT level, HCV genotypes, and the presence of anti-HBc was observed between patients with or without HBV-DNA. When compared histologically, patients with occult HBV infection had higher activity (A2-A3 in 53% vs. 38%, P < 0.01) and more advanced fibrosis (60% vs. 33%, P < 0.001) than HBV-DNA negative cases. Sustained response to combination therapy against Chronic hepatitis C was achieved in 11 (28%) of 40 HBV-DNA positive cases, compared with 65 (45%) of the 144 HBV-DNA negative cases (P < 0.05). Among the 144 HBV-DNA negative HCV patients those with genotype 1 responded less frequently to therapy as compared to other genotypes infected patients (38% vs. 55%, P < 0.05). Surprisingly, when considering all patients studied, irrespective to the HBV-DNA status no significant difference was observed in response to combination therapy regarding HCV genotypes (39% vs. 44%, P > 0.05). In conclusion, HBV-DNA is found in 1/4 of French chronic hepatitis C patients regardless of the presence of anti-HBc. Such an occult HBV co-infection is associated with more severe liver disease, higher HCV viral load and decreased response to antiviral therapy irrespective of HCV genotypes."
766,0.003,3.0000,"There is no consensus regarding the specific management of HIV-associated nephrotic syndrome. We report a child whose first manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was nephropathy and wasting syndrome associated with profound immunodeficiency. The patient had a dramatic clinical and immunologic response to triple antiretroviral therapy delivered through a gastrostomy tube, with complete resolution of nephrotic syndrome. A 51/2-year-old African-American girl presented with a 2-week history of cough, chest pain, vomiting, loose stools, abdominal distention, anorexia, and fever. In addition, she had recurrent oral thrush. Her weight and height were below the 5th percentile. She was chronically ill, appearing with oropharyngeal thrush and pitting edema in lower extremities. She had scattered rhonchi and decreased breath sounds on both lung bases. Her abdomen was distended and diffusely tender. A chest radiograph showed consolidation of the right upper and left lower lobes with bilateral pleural effusion. Admission laboratories were consistent with nephrotic syndrome. Streptococcus pneumoniae grew from the blood culture and the child responded well to treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone. She was found to be HIV-infected, her CD4(+) cell count was 3 cells/mcL and her plasma HIV-1 RNA was >750 000 copies/mL. A percutaneous gastrostomy tube was placed for supplemental nutrition. She was treated with stavudine, lamivudine, and nelfinavir via gastrostomy tube with good clinical response. Twenty-one months after instituting antiretroviral therapy, her weight and height had increased to the 50th and 10th percentile respectively, and she had complete resolution of her nephrotic syndrome. Her CD4(+) cell count increased to 1116 cells/mcL and her viral load has remained undetectable. HIV-1 associated nephrotic syndrome has been described in children with profound immunodeficiency. The course of untreated HIV-associated nephrotic syndrome is rapid progression to renal failure in up to 40% of the children. Regardless of the presence of renal insufficiency, if untreated, it is uniformly fatal. A modest improvement of HIV-1 associated nephrotic syndrome has been observed in patients treated with zidovudine. Steroid and cyclosporine treatment have resulted in improved renal function but long-term use of immunosuppressive therapy has raised concerns about safety. We have described, to our knowledge, the first child with HIV-associated nephrotic syndrome who had a remarkable clinical, immunologic, and virologic response to triple-drug combination therapy given by gastrostomy tube, with complete resolution of proteinuria and normalization of the serum albumin. She also had a striking improvement in weight, height, and quality-of-life. Whether the presence of a gastrostomy tube contributed to the excellent response because of improved compliance is unknown, but warrants systematic evaluation."
206,0.003,3.0000,"The HIV lipodystrophy syndrome, a condition characterized by subcutaneous fat loss sometimes associated with relative or absolute accumulation of central fat, has a high prevalence in the treatment of HIV infection. Associated metabolic alterations include peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, increased free fatty acids, and decreased HDL. Often, these metabolic abnormalities appear or deteriorate before the manifestation of fat redistribution. Hypertriglyceridemia is the leading lipid abnormality after initiation of HIV therapy frequently observed together with low HDL cholesterol. Raised levels of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 have been found in these patients, and there are reports about hypertension associated with antiretroviral therapy. Thus, the lipodystrophy syndrome in HIV therapy resembles a clinical situation that is known as the ""metabolic syndrome"" in HIV-negative patients. There is now good evidence that the metabolic abnormalities of HIV-infected patients harbor a significant risk for cardiovascular disease with as yet unknown consequences. In addition, several studies report a reduced quality of life in patients with body habitus changes leading to reduced therapy adherence. Current data indicate a rather multifactorial pathogenesis where HIV infection, its therapy, and patient-related factors are major contributors. Therapeutic and preventive strategies have, so far, been of only limited or no success. For reduction of the cardiovascular risk, recommendations proposed for non-HIV-infected patients like the National Cholesterol Education Program (NECP) have been adapted for HIV-infected patients. These should be regarded as rather preliminary and need to be evaluated in further clinical trials. General recommendations include dietary changes and physical activity, switch of antiretroviral drugs (replacement of protease inhibitors), and, finally, use of metabolically active drugs. Lipid-lowering agents can be considered for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia, elevated LDL, or a combination of both. Some HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, however, share common hepatic metabolization pathways with protease inhibitors (cytochrome P450 3A4 system), thereby potentially leading to additional liver and muscle toxicity. Although clinicians should assess cardiovascular risk factors and target risk reduction in HIV-infected patients, the primary goal in HIV therapy remains to be the effective suppression of viral replication leading to reduced morbidity and mortality."
644,0.003,3.0000,"The nonstructural 5B (NS5B) protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity plays a pivotal role in viral replication. Therefore, monitoring of its naturally occurring mutations is very important for the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines. In the present study, mutations in the partial NS5B gene (492 bp) from 166 quasispecies of 15 genotype-1b (GT) treatment-naïve Korean chronic patients were determined and mutation patterns and frequencies mainly focusing on the T cell epitope regions were evaluated. The mutation frequency within the CD8+ T cell epitopes was significantly higher than those outside the CD8+ T cell epitopes. Of note, the mutation frequency within predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, a particular mutational hotspot in Korean patients was significantly higher than it was in patients from other areas, suggesting distinctive CD4+ T cell-mediated immune pressure against HCV infection in the Korean population. The mutation frequency in the NS5B region was positively correlated with patients with carrier-stage rather than progressive liver disease (chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Furthermore, the mutation frequency in four codons (Q309, A333, V338 and Q355) known to be related to the sustained virological response (SVR) and end-of treatment response (ETR) was also significantly higher in Korean patients than in patients from other areas. In conclusion, a high degree of mutation frequency in the HCV GT-1b NS5B region, particularly in the predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, was found in Korean patients, suggesting the presence of distinctive CD4+ T cell pressure in the Korean population. This provides a likely explanation of why relatively high levels of SVR after a combined therapy of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) in Korean chronic patients with GT-1b infections are observed. "
6953,0.003,3.0000,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a cytokine that plays an important role in the regulation of the immune system. Gene polymorphisms of IL-10 have been associated with the different expression levels of this cytokine. In hepatitis C virus infection, IL-10 appears to interfere with the progression of disease, viral persistence and the response to therapy. This study investigated genetic variability in the IL-10 gene promoter between patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and healthy individuals, associating the frequency of polymorphisms with different aspects of viral infection. This is a case-control study with 260 patients who were infected with HCV and 260 healthy individuals. Genotyping of the polymorphisms was performed using the technique of amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR) for regions of the IL-10 gene promoter (-1082 G/A, -819 C/T, -592 C/A). The frequencies of alleles and genotypes related to polymorphisms in the IL-10 gene promoter showed a higher frequency of the G allele and genotype GG in the -1082 region between the infected group and the control group (p=0.005 and p=0.001, respectively), whereas the AA genotype was significantly more frequent in the control group. The frequencies of the haplotypes GTA and GCC were higher in the group of infected individuals, whereas the haplotype ATA was more frequent in the healthy group (p<0.006). It was also observed that the genotypes GG and AG in the region -1082 were significantly more frequent among patients infected with HCV who were in advanced stages of fibrosis and cirrhosis (p=0.042). No association was observed between polymorphisms of IL-10 and sustained virologic response (SVR). "
1555,0.003,3.0000,"Drug resistance mutations in the Pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) are one of the critical factors associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure in HIV-1 patients. The issue of resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) in HIV infection has not been adequately addressed in the Indian subcontinent. We compared HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) gene sequences to identify mutations present in HIV-1 patients who were ART non-responders, ART responders and drug naive. Genotypic drug resistance testing was performed by sequencing a 655-bp region of the RT gene from 102 HIV-1 patients, consisting of 30 ART-non-responding, 35 ART-responding and 37 drug-naive patients. The Stanford HIV Resistance Database (HIVDBv 6.2), IAS-USA mutation list, ANRS_09/2012 algorithm, and Rega v8.02 algorithm were used to interpret the pattern of drug resistance. The majority of the sequences (96 %) belonged to subtype C, and a few of them (3.9 %) to subtype A1. The frequency of drug resistance mutations observed in ART-non-responding, ART-responding and drug-naive patients was 40.1 %, 10.7 % and 20.58 %, respectively. It was observed that in non-responders, multiple mutations were present in the same patient, while in responders, a single mutation was found. Some of the drug-naive patients had more than one mutation. Thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs), however, were found in non-responders and naive patients but not in responders. Although drug resistance mutations were widely distributed among ART non-responders, the presence of resistance mutations in the viruses of drug-naive patients poses a big concern in the absence of a genotyping resistance test."
3526,0.003,3.0000,"In Brazil, current trends of the AIDS epidemic include an increase in transmission through heterosexual contact, predominantly from men to women, with more cases of AIDS in women and more children contaminated by vertical transmission. There is also a high proportion of cases in poor people or people living in small towns. HIV-infected patients with high levels of immunodeficiency are frequently hospitalized after their first visit to the clinic due to opportunistic infections, characteristic of advanced disease. This study characterized the clinical and laboratory pattern of AIDS in a sample of patients attended for the first time in the AIDS clinic of the Federal University of Bahia Hospital (HUPES) in Salvador, Brazil. We revised medical charts of cases of subjects registered at the outpatient AIDS clinic from January 1997 to December 2003. The demographics, clinical data, and laboratory characteristics were analyzed to determine the degree of immunodeficiency at the time of admission. A total of 377 patients were evaluated (58.6% were male, with a mean sample age of 33.4 years). The most frequent clinical manifestations were asthenia, weight loss, fever, anemia, dermatitis, oral thrush and diarrhea. CDC criteria were not adequate to define the initial cases. After admission to the outpatient clinic, nearly 25% of the patients were hospitalized immediately, indicating delay in the diagnosis. In Bahia, the initial presentation of HIV-infected patients to health care assistance is occurring at a late stage of the disease, when signs and symptoms of immunodeficiency are already established. Efforts are necessary to construct strategies to make an early diagnosis of these patients, improve the quality of care, and guarantee the benefits of antiretroviral therapy, when it is indicated."
7441,0.003,3.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious global health problem. Approximately 2 billion people worldwide have been infected, and approximately 350 million individuals currently suffer from HBV-induced chronic liver infection, which causes 600,000 deaths annually from chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV is classified in eight genotypes (A-H), and two more have been proposed (I-J). In this paper, complete genome sequences of nine Uruguayan HBV are reported. Five samples belong to genotype F1b and one to genotype A2. Three HBV recombinants were detected: A1/F1b, A2/F1b and D3/F1b. The following mutations were detected: a G1896A substitution, a 33-nucleotide deletion from position 2896 to 2928 in the Pre-S1 region involving Pre-S1 residues 3-13, a 33-nt deletion in the Pre-S1 region involving nt 2913-2945 and Pre-S1 residues 9-19. More F genotypes strains than expected were detected in this study, supporting the hypothesis that there are more people of indigenous origin than declared in our population. Also, one third of the samples analyzed were recombinants. This cannot be explained by the low HBV prevalence in Uruguay, but a high HBV infection rate in drug addicts and dialysis patients could act in favor of multiple-genotype HBV infections that could lead to recombination. "
7834,0.003,3.0000,"As many as 2.2 million persons in the United States are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) (1), and approximately 15%-25% of persons with chronic HBV infection will die prematurely from cirrhosis or liver cancer (2). Since 2006, the overall U.S. incidence of acute HBV infection has remained stable; the rate in 2013 was 1.0 case per 100,000 persons (3). Hepatitis B vaccination is highly effective in preventing HBV infection and is recommended for all infants (beginning at birth), all adolescents, and adults at risk for HBV infection (e.g., persons who inject drugs, men who have sexual contact with men, persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], and others). Hepatitis B vaccination coverage is low among adults: 2013 National Health Interview Survey data indicated that coverage with ≥3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine was 32.6% for adults aged 19-49 years (4). Injection drug use is a risk factor for both hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HBV. Among young adults in some rural U.S. communities, an increased incidence of HCV infection has been associated with a concurrent increase of injection drug use (5); and recent data indicate an increase of acute HCV infection in the Appalachian region associated with injection drug use (6). Using data from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) during 2006-2013, CDC assessed the incidence of acute HBV infection in three of the four Appalachian states (Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia) included in the HCV infection study (6). Similar to the increase of HCV infections recently reported, an increase in incident cases of acute HBV infection in these three states has occurred among non-Hispanic whites (whites) aged 30-39 years who reported injection drug use as a common risk factor. Since 2009, cases of acute HBV infection have been reported from more non-urban than urban regions. Evidence-based services to prevent HBV infection are needed. "
9895,0.003,3.0000,"Previous studies have suggested that hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants may account for the presence of HBV DNA in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative patients (occult HBV infection). However, it is not known how widespread these variants are and how they influence the course of liver disease. To determine the prevalence of variants within the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBsAg, we investigated 2,565 subjects, including subjects with chronic hepatitis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hemodialysis patients, and blood donors. Fifty-one of them had occult HBV infection. The entire S gene from 46 of these patients was sequenced from amplified serum HBV DNA. Forty-three percent (20 of 46) had mutations in the MHR of HBsAg. Thirty-two amino acid substitutions between positions 100-160 of the MHR of HBsAg were detected in 18 patients, and these ranged from 1 to 4 per patient. These changes involved 11 positions inside and 5 outside of the historical first and second loops of the ""a"" determinant, and included the following: Q101K, T115A, K122N, T123A, T126N, Q129N, G130R, T131I, M133T, F134L, C138Y, K141E, P142S, G145R, N146S, and C147F/R. Combinations of mutations were detected in 9 patients, and 7 of these have not been described before. Two further patients had insertion mutations immediately before the ""a"" determinant. Monoclonal antibody binding tests with the Royal Free hepatitis B surface (RFHBs) panel of antibodies revealed decreased immunoreactivity in 6 novel variants of HBsAg. The existence of patients with occult HBV infection caused by HBsAg variants, therefore, has implications for their possible transmission through sexual contact and by blood transfusion."
6295,0.003,3.0000,"Coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is common as a result of shared routes of transmission, especially in high-risk groups such as injection drug users and persons with hemophilia. HIV is known to influence the natural history of HBV, hastening progression to end-stage liver disease and cirrhosis. Antiretroviral therapy for HIV, and associated immune reconstitution, may result in immune-mediated liver damage as HBV-infected hepatocytes are targeted. This can lead to liver enzyme elevations that may be misattributed to drug-related toxicity. Thus, it is important that HIV-infected patients be tested for HBV and that clinicians be aware of the possibility of atypical serologic markers of HBV in HIV-infected patients. In managing coinfected patients, control of HIV is the priority. In patients with controlled HIV who are candidates for HBV therapy, the goals are the same as in the HBV-monoinfected population: hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, liver enzyme normalization, and HBV DNA suppression. Treatment options include interferon-based regimens, lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, and entecavir. All of these agents have been shown to be relatively effective in HBV-monoinfected patients. However, few randomized, controlled HBV treatment trials have been conducted in coinfected subjects, and thus additional studies are warranted."
6892,0.003,3.0000,"The new recommendations reflect the increase in knowledge that has been reported since the release of previous Czech guidelines in September 2014. The basis for these guidelines were the European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines from April 2017. According to qualified estimates, there are 240 million people with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection worldwide. The Czech Republic is among the countries with a low prevalence of HBV infection. According to the latest seroprevalence study, 0.56 % of the Czech citizens were chronically infected with HBV in 2001. A similar study conducted in only two regions of the Czech Republic in 2013 showed a prevalence of only 0.064 %. HBV infection can lead to serious life-threatening liver damage - fulminant hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The main goals of treatment are to prolong the length of life and improve its quality by preventing the progression of chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis, cirrhosis decompensation and development of HCC. The goals may be achieved if HBV replication is suppressed in a sustained manner. Additional goals are prevention of vertical transmission from mother to newborn, inhibition of HBV reactivation and therapy of HBV-related extrahepatic manifestations. Generally, there are two different strategies of chronic hepatitis B therapy available - treatment with nucleoside or nucleotide inhibitors (NIs) or with pegylated interferon alfa. Currently, the vast majority of Czech and European patients are treated with NIs. The NIs that have been approved for HBV treatment in the European Union include lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir (ETV), telbivudin (TBV), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). TAF and TBV have not yet been marketed in the Czech Republic. The main advantages of treatment with potent NIs with a high barrier to resistance (ETV, TDF, TAF) are their predictable high long-term antiviral efficacy leading to undetectable HBV DNA levels in the vast majority of compliant patients as well as their favorable safety profiles. These drugs can be used in any HBV infected patient and represent the only treatment option for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplants, extrahepatic HBV-related manifestations, severe acute hepatitis B or chronic HBV reactivation."
6026,0.003,3.0000,"Having noted the good clinical status of some HIV patients who were referred for but refused surgery, we undertook surgery with the aim of determining outcome, risk-to-benefit ratio and, if possible, the effect of surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on the progression of their HIV disease. Antiretroviral drugs (ARVD) were not available to these patients. The records of 49 patients, 17 males and 32 females, aged between 17 and 67 years, undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass over a nine-year period, were reviewed. Forty-eight of these underwent cardiac surgery and one aortic dissection repair. Four HIV-infected patients underwent surgery with good early outcome. Thereafter an absolute CD4 cell count greater than 400/microl (normal 550*1 955/microl) and the absence of the stigmata of AIDS in patients fulfilling the normal criteria for surgery allowed cardiac surgery using CPB. Fifty operations were performed. Three patients with CD4 counts of 37, 868 and 1 245/microl died early, giving a 30-day mortality of 6% for 50 procedures. Six patients with active infective endocarditis (IE) underwent emergency surgery. Three of these, one with a pre- and two with only post-operative counts all below 250/microl, died within three months. Sixteen complications occurred in the remaining 46 patients (34.7%). Pre-operative CD4 cell counts taken in 42 patients averaged 685/microl. Pre- and post-operative counts known in eight showed variations, as did repeated counts in those awaiting surgery. Forty-one patients left hospital in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, five in class II and one in class III. Prior to surgery, the majority (38) were in class III and seven were in class IV. Follow up ranging from two to 70 months averaged 23.1 months. Eight late deaths occurred, three related to AIDS. We found surgery to be worthwhile in selected HIV-infected patients. Early outcome paralleled that in the uninfected, giving a low risk-to-benefit ratio. Emergency surgery in those with active infective endocarditis and marked immune compromise met with high mortality. It is essential in our population to test and stage all patients for HIV. We could not show that CPB accelerated progression to AIDS. This experience and the present availability of ARVDs would enable us to review our selection criteria for surgery."
13,0.003,3.0000,"No consistently effective therapy is yet available for the treatment of chronic HBsAg, anti-HBe, HBV-DNA-positive hepatitis. A multicenter trial has shown that the response rates are not significantly different when patients with anti-HBe-positive hepatitis are treated with six-month course of thymosin-alpha1 or of interferon-alpha. However, since among these patients, interferon's real efficacy is still debated, with sustained biochemical response achieved in only a few of the treated patients, we conducted this controlled study to investigate the safety and efficacy of thymosin-alpha1 as compared with no treatment. Forty-four chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers, who were anti-HBe- and HBV-DNA-positive, were randomized, with stratification for the presence of cirrhosis at baseline liver biopsy, to receive either thymosin-alpha1 at a dose of 900 microg/m2 twice a week for six months or no treatment. At entry, both groups of patients were comparable for sex, age, liver histology, ALT, IgM anti-HBc, and HBV-DNA levels. Forty-two patients were followed-up for 20 months (median; range 12-32 months) after completion of therapy: one dropped out, and one developed hepatocellular carcinoma at six months. Thymosin-alpha1 treatment had no side effects. Six months after the end of the therapy, HBV-DNA was negative and ALT had normalized in 14% of treated cases and in 4.5% of control group, while IgM anti-HBc was negative (<0.200) in 14% of the treated patients and in 4.5% of the controls. Among the treated patients, the median ALT levels stayed significantly lower compared to the pretreatment values during the treatment period and six months of follow-up. During the first year, there were six flares of hepatitis in the control group and five among the treated patients (P = NS), yielding a per year average of 0.3 and 0.23 flares per patient, respectively. Among the treated patients, median IgM anti-HBc levels were low with respect to baseline values 4-10 months after treatment started. None became HBsAg negative. In conclusion, these results indicate that, in anti-HBe, HBV-DNA-positive chronic hepatitis B, thymosin-alpha1 therapy alone does not increase the response rate, but may contribute to reduce the immune-mediated liver cell necrosis as indirectly assessed by ALT and IgM anti-HBc levels."
2593,0.003,3.0000,"CD4 T lymphocyte and plasma HIV RNA parameters have been used to monitor disease progression, and predict clinical course in HIV infection. Initial evaluation of these parameters was conducted in the western countries where accessible ARVs, circulating HIV subtypes and mode of transmission are different from the situation in Nigeria. This study appraised these parameters, and efficacy of generic ARVs. Consenting 106 HIV infected ARV naïve patients were enrolled. CD4 T lymphocyte and plasma HIV RNA levels were determined at interval for 24 months. Ninety eight (92.5%) of the patients who completed the follow up in strict adherence to therapy guideline were included in the analysis. Baseline median CD4 T lymphocyte increased from 114 (Range: 6-330) to highest 357 (Range: 15-1036) cells/ μ L at 18 months of therapy, while baseline median plasma viral RNA declined from 4.6 (Range: 2.6-6.0) Log10 copies/mL to undetectable level within three months of therapy. Significant CD4 T-cell restoration and plasma viral RNA decline in the study population demonstrate efficacy of the generic HAART. The importance of combined use of both parameters for evaluation of immunologic and virologic responses to ART was confirmed. "
9196,0.003,3.0000,"Because of the increasing availability of antiretroviral (ARV) agents for HIV in low-income countries, many clinicians now need training on their use. This is especially true for clinicians caring for individuals with tuberculosis (TB), given its close relationship with HIV/AIDS. This article summarizes the key decisions facing clinicians who manage HIV-infected persons, with particular reference to issues regarding those dually infected with TB. Health care provider-initiated diagnostic testing using rapid HIV tests should be offered to all individuals with symptoms and signs suggesting HIV infection, including all persons with TB. Issues to be included in pre- and post-test counseling sessions are discussed. HIV-infected patients should be evaluated to determine clinical staging of HIV; certain laboratory examinations should ideally be performed to assess the degree of immunosuppression and to aid decisions about when best to start ARV therapy and preventive therapies. The recommended ARV regimens and guidance on proposed patient follow-up are presented. Good adherence to ARVs is required and factors that induce and reinforce compliance are suggested. The treatment of TB is a high priority, and follows the same principles whether the patient is HIV-infected or not. Suggestions are made about ARV use in patients with TB. A standardized and complementary information system should be developed to monitor management of HIV-TB patients and performance of joint TB and HIV care efforts. By diagnosing and managing additional HIV cases detected through the portal of the TB control programme, clinicians will contribute to diminishing the burden of HIV, and thus, TB."
9766,0.003,3.0000,"Two methods were used to unveil a possible previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients with postnecrotic liver cirrhosis. The anamnestic response to a booster injection of HB vaccine was assessed, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for the detection of HBV-DNA in serum and liver tissue, using primers to span the precore and core regions, was employed. Seventeen patients with postnecrotic liver cirrhosis were selected from a population with a high prevalence of HBV infection and were compared with 11 liver cirrhosis patients who were positive for antibodies to surface antigen (anti-HBs) IgG antibodies. All patients were given one dose of HB vaccine into the deltoid muscle, and anti-HBs titers were measured 1 and 4 wk after injection. Three of 17 patients, initially negative for anti-HBs, showed a primary response, with titers of anti-HBs rising from 0 to a maximum of 85 mIU/ml after 4 wk; the rest had no response. Of the 11 patients positive for anti-HBs, of whom nine were also IgG anti-HBs positive, only four had an intense anamnestic response, with anti-HBs titers rising to more than 10 times the initial values (up to 10,800 mIU/ml). Serum HBV-DNA was detected in eight patients in the antibody-negative group and in only one patient in the antibody-positive group (p less than 0.02). None of the four patients with positive anamnestic response had HBV-DNA in the serum. The prevalence of HBV-DNA in the liver was similar in both groups. Absence of HBV-DNA in serum of most patients positive for anti-HBs supports the hypothesis that HBV particles released from the liver may be captured by antibodies in the serum. We conclude that assessment of the anamnestic response to HB vaccine has no diagnostic advantage, compared with direct measurement of conventional HBV serological markers in patients with liver cirrhosis. Moreover, we suggest that this type of immunologic response may not occur when virion-associated HBV-DNA is present in the serum."
3010,0.003,3.0000,"Patients coinfected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were studied with regard to nucleotide sequence variability in the E2/NS1 first hypervariable region of the HCV genome. The nucleotide variability within individual patients was compared to patients infected only with HCV. The proportion of predicted synonymous and nonsynonymous amino acid changes, and the relationship to putative high-antigenicity sites, were evaluated in the hypervariable envelope domain. Ninety-one clones from 10 patients with HCV/HIV coinfection were sequenced, following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the hypervariable region. The control HCV group included 53 clones from 7 patients. Sequence analysis encompassed the region coding for amino acids 384 to 414. Consensus sequences from each patient were used as the internal standard for nonsynonymous amino acid codon variability. Cumulative proportional comparison at each amino acid site revealed increased variability in HCV RNA from patients with HCV/HIV coinfection versus HCV alone (P < .05). The greatest variability was observed at amino acids 386, 397, 400, 402, 405, 407, and 414, with >l0 percent clonal variation at these sites. Jameson-Wolf plots were used to predict putative high-antigenicity domains. Nonsynonymous clonal variation resulted in alteration of putative antigenic sites within the hypervariable region. All clones had at least one high-probability site. Clones with unique predicted antigenic domains were observed more frequently in HIV/HCV coinfected patients, and, independent of viral titer, were consistent with increased sequence variability. These data suggest an accumulation of envelope variants in the HCV/HIV coinfected patients, which could be related to ineffective viral clearance, and may help explain prior reports of interferon (IFN) resistance in this patient group."
3208,0.003,3.0000,"While the expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa has reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV/AIDS, it has increased concern about drug resistance. The Microbicide Trials Network 009 study assessed the prevalence of drug-resistance mutations among women at clinical sites in Durban, South Africa who tested seropositive for HIV-1 at screening for the VOICE trial. The objective of this paper was to identify characteristics and behaviors associated with drug resistance. Factors found to be significantly associated with increased resistance were high perceived risk of getting HIV and prior participation in a microbicide trial, a likely proxy for familiarity with the health care system. Two factors were found to be significantly associated with reduced resistance: having a primary sex partner and testing negative for HIV in the past year. Other variables hypothesized to be important in identifying women with resistant virus, including partner or friend on ART who shared with the participant and being given antiretrovirals during pregnancy or labor, or the proxy variable-number of times given birth in a health facility-were not significantly associated. The small number of participants with resistant virus and the probable underreporting of sensitive behaviors likely affected our ability to construct a comprehensive profile of the type of HIV-positive women at greatest risk of developing resistance mutations.

4172,0.003,3.0000,"Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is believed to be associated with reduced hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity and risk factors such as alcohol abuse and medication with oral contraceptives and certain other drugs. Recently it has been suggested that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may also be associated with PCT. We have therefore reviewed the prevalence of HCV infection in a series of patients with PCT in the Lothian region of Scotland. We identified 12 patients with PCT, all of whom had abnormal liver function tests. Liver histology revealed chronic active hepatitis in six patients, micronodular cirrhosis in four patients, hepatocellular carcinoma in one patient and normal findings in one HIV positive patient. Out of 12 patients tested, 11 were positive for anti-HCV antibodies by second generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA 2), and by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA 2); positive serology was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In a second group of 14 patients with chronic HCV infection matched for age and sex with the PCT patients, all had normal urinary uroporphyrin excretion. We have thus confirmed in Scotland early reports from Spain and Italy that PCT is strongly associated with HCV infection. This could explain the development of inflammatory changes in the liver and progression of liver disease in patients with PCT. Porphyrin metabolism, however, appears normal in patients with chronic HCV infection without PCT."
3809,0.003,3.0000,"Occult Hepatitis B Infection (OBI) is a form of chronic HBV infection characterized by low level HBV DNA, without detectable HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). OBI is frequently associated with the presence of anti-HBc and in some cases also with anti-HBs. Patients, who formerly received non-inactivated factor concentrates, can potentially be considered at high risk for OBI, especially since these patients usually are HIV or HCV co-infected. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of occult HBV infection in Greek patients with hereditary bleeding disorders. The study sample comprised of 114 patients from a single haemophilia center. All patients were screened for HBV serum markers and individually tested for HBV DNA using a qualitative PCR. Presence of HBV DNA was further confirmed by quantification of viral load with an ultrasensitive in-house real time PCR. 88 and 21 patients with haemophilia A and B, respectively, 4 patients with von Willebrand Disease and 1 patient with severe factor VII deficiency were screened for the presence of OBI. Anti-HBc were detected in 53 (46.5%) subjects; 18 of them were anti-HBs(-) and 35 anti-HBs(+). Anti-HBe were present in 26 subjects. Two out of 114 patients were HBsAg(+). Of the remaining 112 HBsAg(-) patients tested, two (1.8%) were found HBsAg(-), HBV DNA(+), anti-HBc(+) and anti-HBs(-) and were identified as potential OBI cases. Both cases exhibited very low DNA levels; 38.2IU/mL in patient A and 14.2IU/mL in patient B. Both patients were HBeAg(-), but patient A had HBe antibodies. Patient B was also HIV/HCV co-infected. In conclusion, two cases of OBI with low HBV viraemia were identified among patients with congenital bleeding disorders. Although the incidence in our sample is moderately low (1.8%), close monitoring of these infections is of great clinical significance, especially in patients with co-infections and concomitant immunosuppression."
6386,0.003,3.0000,"The aim of this study was to evaluate quality of life (QOL) and analyze its determinants among Cambodian adults living with HIV/AIDS who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART). A cross-sectional study was conducted using convenience sampling to select 150 adults 18 years of age or older from the patient population at the HIV/AIDS care hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. QOL was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life HIV BREF; socio-demographic characteristics, time elapsed since HIV diagnosis, months on ART, CD4 cell count, family and community support, depression, and anxiety were included in the survey. Results of the multiple regression analysis indicate that positive predictors of QOL included being female, being less 40 years old, having a household monthly income greater than 300 USD, having an education beyond the secondary level, or being employed. However, time elapsed since HIV diagnosis and duration of ART were not significantly associated with QOL and CD4 cell count and the World Health Organization clinical stage had little association with QOL. Perceiving oneself as healthy and happy and reporting no depression or anxiety were associated with a positive QOL. These findings suggest the importance of group-specific interventions to improve the QOL for those people living with HIV/AIDS in Cambodia who are male, have a low household income or education level, are unemployed, or are anxious or depressed."
176,0.003,3.0000,"Witness for the prosecution: Assays to detect antiretroviral drug resistance have recently become available, but several factors limit the clinical utility of resistance testing in patients with primary HIV infection (PHI). First, there is a great uncertainty in the prevalence of PHI due to resistant virus, which may vary from 2% to over 50%. Moreover, studies on temporal trends give discordant results. Secondly, the reported degree of resistance is also variable since low levels of resistance are reported in some cases. The clinical significance of such low-level baseline reduced susceptibility to some antiretrovirals is uncertain. Thirdly, current resistance testing might not detect minority populations of drug-resistant species. Reversion of mutations conferring drug resistance was described in patients who acquired drug-resistant strains, and viral strains harbouring drug-resistant mutations may become minor species in untreated patients owing to the absence of drug pressure. Finally, no prospective clinical trials have been conducted to test the clinical or virological utility of resistance testing in PHI. Witness for the defence: A suboptimal initial regimen in subjects infected with drug-resistant virus may be associated with multiple treatment failures in the early stage of the disease and hence with a more rapid disease progression. When treating PHI, immediate, complete and long-lasting suppression of virus replication is desired both to limit total body viral burden and to preserve HIV-1 specific immune responses. Transmission of resistant virus has been identified for each therapeutic class. A greater than 2.5-fold resistance to one or more antiretroviral agent has been observed in 26% of patients with PHI and resistance among newly infected patients has increased over the past 3 y. Treatment should not be delayed to wait for the result of the test. However, once a resistant virus has been identified, one or more drugs can be readily substituted. Prospective randomized studies to address the need for baseline resistance testing in the setting of PHI are warranted."
9472,0.003,3.0000,"Mycobacterial infection remains as a frequent complication associated to HIV infection. Although the widespread use of HAART has intensely decreased incidence of disseminated Mycobacterium avium (MAC) infection, it does not seem that it has affected tuberculosis occurrence so intensely. In spite of the intense search of new methods of rapid diagnosis, in the clinical practice the diagnosis of the mycobacterial illnesses continues based on culture, although the appearance of new media has allowed to shorten the time of growth. The combination of isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF) and pirazinamide (PZ) (with ethambutol [ETB] when primary resistance to INH is higher than 4%), remains as the elective treatment for tuberculosis in HIV infected patients. Due to the interaction between RIF and some antiretovirals drugs, such as proteasa inhibitors, a change in the usual regimens could be necessary. Combinations without RIF or antiretroviral therapy with drugs not interacting with RIF (nucleosides, ritonavir or nevirapin) have been suggested. The emergence of strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to the antituberculosis drugs, the lack of adherence to treatment, and the frequency of adverse events hinders even more the control of the tuberculosis and they demand a narrow follow up of these patients. The treatment of the disseminated infection by MAC has improved in the last years with the generalization of the combinations including macrolides as claritromicin or azitromicin with ETB. The doubt persists about what combination is more effective, although like in other opportunists infections associated with a severe immunodeficiency, using antiretrovirals combinations that enhance the immune system could be a fundamental therapeutic approach."
3810,0.003,3.0000,"Within human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients, there are those who have been infected for more than 10 years with a CD4+ cell count of >500 cells microl(-1) and who remain asymptomatic without antiretroviral therapy; these patients are designated long-term non-progressors (LTNPs). In a set of 16 LTNPs, viral dating, DNA viral load, quasispecies heterogeneity and antibody (Ab) titres against gp160 and beta2 microglobulin (beta2m) were determined. Plasma viral RNA and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell numbers were estimated in more than three samples per patient. Host genetic characteristics, such as Delta32-CCR5 genotype and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype and supertypes, and clinical-epidemiological factors were evaluated. Dating of global populations and of DNA and RNA viral quasispecies identified two subsets of patients: one displaying only ancestral sequences and the other displaying predominantly modern sequences. The ancestral patients displayed a significant reduction in RNA and DNA viral loads, quasispecies heterogeneity, CD8+ cell number, anti-gp160 Ab titres and beta2m level, and they were also associated with better use of safe-sex practices and higher presence of the HLA sB58 supertype than the modern subset. Viral dating has therefore permitted the segregation of LTNPs into two subsets that show very different virological, immunological, host and clinical-epidemiological characteristics. Moreover, whereas the modern subset displayed low levels of virus replication, the ancestral group displayed not only a very limited virus replication, often to undetectable levels, but also very slow or arrested viral evolution, maintaining the close relationship of the viral population to the transmitted virus."
6155,0.003,3.0000,"In hepatitis B virus carriers who are anti-HBe positive despite ongoing viral replication (HBcAg in liver and HBV-DNA in serum) the natural course of hepatitis is severe and the response to interferon is low. We investigated whether a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) strain could be involved. A translational termination codon at the carboxyterminal end of the pre-C region responsible for the lack of HBeAg secretion was found in 18 of 19 HBV clones isolated from seven pedigreed patients with this clinical syndrome. The same findings were confirmed by direct sequencing. One of these patients underwent a liver transplant and HBV infection of the new liver resulted in high titered viremia and intrahepatic expression of HBcAg, without detectable HBeAg in serum. Another patient was superinfected by hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and developed high titres of total and IgM anti-HD. In spite of this, chronic hepatitis remained unchanged during 7 years of follow-up. These data strongly suggest that a viable precore minus mutant of hepatitis B virus is responsible for the lack of HBeAg in the serum of these patients. The HBV variant may explain the peculiar geographic distribution of anti-HBe positive hepatitis. The variations in the virus genome sequence may cause the more severe form of liver disease and modify the pathogenicity in the case of HDV superinfection."
80,0.003,3.0000,"We estimated prevalence and incidence of liver condition outcomes, and costs to the health service of diagnosed hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Tayside, UK. HBV patients were identified from electronic virology data between 1989 and 2003. The health resource costs of HBV for surface antigen-positive (HBsAg+) patients and HBV (HBsAg+ or immune, i.e. recovered) patients were calculated. A total of 633 patients had HBV (275 HBsAg+), and were more likely to be male (62% vs. 48%), older (mean age 42.6 vs. 39 . 2 years) and deprived than the general population. The prevalence of immune individuals increased steadily. Post-HBV diagnosis, 24% of immune and 13% of HBsAg+ patients were diagnosed with a liver condition. The median cost per immune patient (£3023) was greater than per HBsAg+ patient (£1498) (P=0.02). While increasing prevalence of immune HBV patients highlights an increase in screening and treatment, the costs associated with this group are high."
5142,0.003,3.0000,"We have investigated hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in systemic necrotizing vasculitis (SNV). Our approach included the detection of the viral surface antigen (HBsAg) with a radioimmunoassay employing monoclonal anti-HBs (m-RIA); in addition, HBV DNA was looked for in serum and peripheral mononuclear blood cells. Among 28 subjects with SNV, 12 were found to be positive for HBsAg with the conventional test (p-RIA) and 7 additional subjects had anti-HBc and/or anti-HBs. From the 16 HBsAg negative individuals, 9 had HBsAg epitopes identified in serum with the m-RIA test and 1 had a low amount of circulating viral DNA. In contrast, only 1 among 6 subjects with other systemic vasculitis showed a positive test for m-RIA and HBV DNA assays; this individual had acquired HIV infection through transfusions which were also probably the source of his HBV infection. HBV DNA sequences were identified in peripheral mononuclear blood cells of 9 from the 37 tested, including 2 individuals who were HBsAg positive only with m-RIA. Therefore, our study indicates a much higher rate of HBV infection in patients with polyarteritis nodosa than previously suspected."
2722,0.003,3.0000,": To date, the relation between the CD8 antiviral factor (CAF) and clinical indicators of disease progression in HIV-1 infection (CD4 T-cell counts and viral load [VL]) is inconclusive. Particularly, the effect of antiretroviral therapy and immune recovery on CAF production remains unclear. Using a transient transfection assay and a reporter gene activated by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), we analyzed CAF production in CD8 T cells of HIV-1-positive individuals divided into 3 groups: patients on protease inhibitor (PI)-based therapy, patients on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapy, and patients receiving no therapy. We found that within the untreated group, CAF activity inversely correlated with VL and high CAF was associated with lower VLs over a period of 0.5 to 3 years. Furthermore, patients who were drug-naive demonstrated significantly higher CAF than untreated patients who had previously undergone antiretroviral therapy. CAF activity in treated patients was similar to CAF in drug-naive patients and higher than in off-treatment patients. There seemed to be a trend toward higher CAF in patients on NNRTI-based therapy compared with those on PI-based therapy. These results suggest that immune recovery after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) contributes to the normalization of CAF levels in HIV-1-positive individuals. Furthermore, we have distinguished between CD8 T-cell-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication and gene transcription."
3377,0.003,3.0000,"Osteoporosis is increasingly reported in the aging HIV-positive population, and co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) may further increase the risk of osteoporosis. However, it remains unclear whether HCV-related increased fracture risk is a function of the severity of liver disease. We calculated the time-updated alanine aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) score (an indirect marker of hepatic fibrosis) in all HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Veterans Affairs' Clinical Case Registry between 1984 and 2009. The association between HCV co-infection and incident osteoporotic fracture (defined as closed wrist, vertebral, or hip fracture) was assessed in univariate and multivariate Cox survival models adjusting for traditional risk factors for osteoporosis and APRI score or the presence of cirrhosis. A total of 772 osteoporotic fractures were identified among 56,660 HIV-infected patients (98.1% male; 31.3% HCV co-infected; median age 44.0 years) contributing 305,237 patient-years of follow-up. Fracture rates were significantly higher among HIV/HCV patients than HIV-only patients (2.57 versus 2.07/1000 patient-years, relative risk = 1.24, p < 0.0001). In a Cox multivariable model including age, race, smoking, drug use, body mass index, and antiretroviral therapy, HCV co-infection remained an independent predictor of osteoporotic fractures after controlling for presence of cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.32; p <0.001) or APRI score (HR = 1.30; p = 0.003). Among HIV/HCV co-infected patients, cirrhosis strongly predicted osteoporotic fractures (HR = 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-2.44; p = 0.012), but APRI score was a weaker predictor (HR = 1.008; 95% CI 1.002-1.014; p = 0.015). In conclusion, among HIV-infected patients, severity of liver disease partly explains the HCV-associated increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Other determinants of this increased risk remain to be defined."
87,0.003,3.0000,"The purpose of this open and multicenter trial was to determine the usefulness of antibody detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in gingival crevicular transudate (GCT), which was collected with an investigational device (Orasure; Epitope, Beaverton, Oreg.), for the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and to compare it with antibody detection in serum. A total of 1,880 individuals were tested, as follows: 354 HIV-1-infected individuals (111 asymptomatics individuals and 243 individuals with AIDS), 46 individuals with autoimmune diseases (AD), 296 individuals with dental diseases, 42 individuals with other chronic diseases, and 1,142 healthy individuals. Sera from 356 individuals and GCT from 354 individuals were positive for HIV-1 antibodies. There were two false-negative gingival samples, one from an HIV-1-positive asymptomatic individual and one from a patient with AIDS. HIV-1 antibodies were unexpectedly detected in both serum and GCT of two individuals, one with dental disease and one with pulmonary tuberculosis. None of the sera or GCTs from healthy subjects or patients with AD were positive. Compared with the serum assay, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the GCT assay were 99.5, 100, 100, and 99.9%, respectively. Of 355 paired serum-GCT samples that were HIV-1 positive by ELISA and that were tested by Western blot (immunoblot), all were positive for HIV-1 by using the U.S. Public Health Service interpretation criteria, while among gingival samples, 301 were positive, 52 were indeterminate, and 2 were negative. Of 82 negative paired samples selected at random, 80 were negative by Western blotting of serum and GCT and 2 were indeterminate by Western blotting of serum and negative by Western blotting of GCT (a healthy blood donor and a patient with dermatopolymyositis). Testing for HIV-1 antibodies in GCT is a simple and reliable screening procedure in populations with high and low prevalences of infection because of the high sensitivity and specificity of the method, and it offers improved safety for hospital personnel."
540,0.003,3.0000,"Puerto Rico has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS seen for any US state or territory, and antiretroviral therapy has been a mainstay of efforts to mitigate the HIV/AIDS public health burden on the island. We studied the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 mutation and antiretroviral drug resistance in Puerto Rico by monitoring the population frequency of resistance-associated mutations from 2002 to 2011. Whole blood samples from 4,475 patients were analyzed using the TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit and OpenGene DNA Sequencing System in the Immunoretrovirus Research Laboratory at Universidad Central del Caribe. Results show that 64.0% of female and 62.9% of male patients had HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to at least one antiretroviral medication. L63P and M184V were the dominant mutations observed for the protease (PRO) and reverse transcriptase (RT) encoding genes, respectively. Specific resistance mutations, along with their associated drug resistance profiles, can be seen to form temporal clusters that reveal a steadily changing landscape of resistance trends over time. Both women and men showed resistance mutations for an average of 4.8 drugs over the 10-year period, further underscoring the strong selective pressure exerted by antiretrovirals along with the rapid adaptive response of HIV. Nevertheless, both female and male patients showed a precipitous decrease for overall drug resistance, and for PRO mutations in particular, over the entire course of the study, with the most rapid decrease in frequency seen after 2006. The reduced HIV-1 mutation and drug resistance trends that we observed are consistent with previous reports from multi-year studies conducted around the world. Reduced resistance can be attributed to the use of more efficacious antiretroviral drug therapy, including the introduction of multi-drug combination therapies, which limited the ability of the virus to mount rapid adaptive responses to antiretroviral selection pressure."
1155,0.003,3.0000,"With about 350 million virus carriers, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health problem. HBV is a noncytopathic virus causing persistent infection, but it is still unknown whether host recognition of HBV may activate an innate immune response. We describe that upon infection of primary human liver cells, HBV is recognized by nonparenchymal cells of the liver, mainly by liver macrophages (Kupffer cells), although they are not infected. Within 3 hours, this recognition leads to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and subsequently to the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta), but does not induce an interferon response. The activation of proinflammatory cytokines, however, is transient, and even inhibits responsiveness toward a subsequent challenge. IL-6 released by Kupffer cells after activation of NF-kappaB controls HBV gene expression and replication in hepatocytes at the level of transcription shortly after infection. Upon binding to its receptor complex, IL-6 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases exogenous signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and c-jun N-terminal kinase, which inhibit expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1alpha and HNF 4alpha, two transcription factors essential for HBV gene expression and replication."
833,0.003,3.0000,"Ex vivo effector cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity was assessed in 27 members of the Australian Long-Term Nonprogressor cohort and correlated with genetic, virological, and immunological markers. The 27 individuals were antiretroviral naive with CD4(+) T-cell counts of >500 cells/ microl for more than 8 years after human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Effector CTL activity was determined using a standard ex vivo chromium release assay. Individuals with CTL activity (HIV-1 env(IIIB) or pol or gag) were then compared to those without CTL activity in relation to plasma HIV-1 RNA, ICD p24 antigen, beta(2)-microglobulin, CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts, CCR5 and CCR2b genotypes, and progression to CD4 <500 cells/microl or commencement of antiretroviral treatment. Of the 27 individuals examined, 19 had no detectable effector CTL activity. The eight individuals with detectable CTL activity had significantly higher plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA (P = 0.014), immune complex dissociated p24 antigen (P = 0.006), and beta(2)-microglobulin (P = 0.009). There was increased risk of progression within 4 years of study entry in individuals with detectable effector CTL activity, higher plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA, higher beta(2)-microglobulin levels, and higher immune complex dissociated p24 antigen levels at enrollment (P = 0.017, P = 0.004, P = 0.027, P = 0.008 respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated viral load remained the strongest predictor of disease progression within this group (P = 0.017). There were no significant associations between CTL response and chemokine receptor genotype. These findings demonstrate the importance of HIV replication in generating an effector CTL response and show that effector CTL activity may be an early predictor of progression in people with long-term asymptomatic HIV infection."
6979,0.003,3.0000,"Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) have revolutionized the modern treatment of chronic hepatitis C (HCV). These highly efficacious, well-tolerated, all-oral HCV regimens allow cure of HCV in over 95% of HCV-monoinfected as well as HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with short treatment durations of 8-12 weeks. Areas covered: This review will address recent developments of DAA-therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients in clinical trials and real life cohorts and evaluate remaining challenges, particularly resistance, drug-drug interactions, acute HCV infection and liver transplantation focusing on HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Expert opinion: Indeed, all available data have shown that HIV/HCV-coinfection has no impact on HCV-treatment outcome. Management, indication of therapy and follow-up of HCV-infection are now the same for both patient populations. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients however, require careful evaluation of potential drug-drug-interactions between HCV drugs and HIV antiretroviral therapy, medication for substance abuse and other comedications. The few remaining gaps in DAA-therapy in particular treatment of cirrhotic treatment-experienced genotype 3 infections, decompensated cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease and patients with prior DAA treatment failure have mostly been overcome by the development of new HCV agents recently licensed. Clearly, the biggest challenge globally remains the access to treatment and the inclusion of all patient populations affected in particular people who inject drugs (PWID)."
6653,0.003,3.0000,"In South Africa, where it is estimated that more people have HIV than anywhere else in the world, HIV/AIDS and psychological disorder co-morbidity have been shown both to exacerbate the late diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and to affect adherence to ARVs. Targeted, affordable and evidence-based strategies to reach these populations are essential. Against this backdrop, a pilot project and situational assessment aimed at determining the context of psychological care and HIV treatment services in South Africa was undertaken. The situational analysis consisted of individual interviews, a patient survey, and a retrospective medical record data review. Training and mentorship were conducted from 2011 to 2013 by the Foundation for Professional Development (FPD) in five anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinics in the Tshwane-Metsweding area. Data were both descriptively and inferentially analysed. Outcomes indicate that the general structure of HIV services is well organised and well run in the sampled clinics. However, mental healthcare and HIV services need to be integrated further. There is also a need to develop and pilot-test appropriate materials and models for the delivery of mental healthcare within the parameters of affordability, acceptability and availability further, and to advocate the advancement of mental health and HIV treatment and policy integration."
6768,0.003,3.0000,"Cases of tuberculosis identified during 1992-1994 through an active tuberculosis surveillance network among six hospitals that serve New York City (the TBNetwork) were analyzed according to the occupational status of the patients. Clinical data were obtained by review of medical records, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was performed. No known nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred at these hospitals in the study period. Occupational status was known for 142 of 201 patients whose isolates were available for strain typing. Patients infected by organisms with a clustered strain typing pattern, as determined by RFLP analysis, were presumed to have recently acquired disease. RFLP typing revealed that isolates from 13 (65%) of 20 health care workers and 50 (41%) of 122 non-health care workers had a clustered RFLP pattern. The strains infecting eight (89%) of nine health care workers seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had a clustered RFLP pattern. Multivariate analysis of 75 patients with known HIV and occupational status revealed that HIV status (P = .03) and health care worker status (P = .02; RR = 2.77) were independent risk factors for a clustered RFLP strain. These findings suggest that many of the apparently sporadic cases of tuberculosis among health care workers may be due to unrecognized occupational transmission."
3261,0.003,3.0000,"This study assessed prescribing physicians' attitudes toward early initiation of HAART, three months after the dissemination of the first French official treatment guideline. Telephone interviews have been made in a national random sample of physicians with full- or part-time practice in hospital departments delivering care for HIV-infected patients. Questionnaires included hypothetical clinical cases. Logistic regression compared characteristics of respondents according to attitudes toward HAART. Among the 483 respondents (response rate = 87.0%), agreement was high with official recommendations to systematically initiate HAART with protease inhibitors (PIs) for patients with CD4+ cell counts < or = 300/mm3, following a diagnosis of acute primary HIV infection, or for HIV sexual risk post-exposure prophylaxis. Confronted with a case of a naive asymptomatic patient with stable 450 CD4+/mm3, 34.6% would prescribe HAART with PIs in any case, and 29.8% only if the patient has plasma viral load < or = 10,000 HIV RNA copies/ml. The remaining 35.6% would not prescribe PIs and were older, had limited activity in HIV care and expressed more interest in alternative medicines. To avoid a confusing impact of variability of clinical attitudes toward uncertainties associated with antiretroviral treatments among HIV-infected patients, shared decision-making between patient and physician should be promoted for initiation of HAART."
5324,0.003,3.0000,"HIV-1 is able to evade innate antiviral responses during acute infection to establish a chronic systemic infection which, in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART), typically progresses to severe immunodeficiency. Understanding these early innate immune responses against HIV-1 and their mechanisms of failure is relevant to the development of interventions to better prevent HIV-1 transmission. Human beta defensins (HBDs) are antibacterial peptides but have recently also been associated with control of viral replication. HBD1 and 2 are expressed in PBMCs as well as intestinal tissue, but their expression in vivo during HIV-1 infection has not been characterized. We demonstrate that during acute HIV-1 infection, HBD1 but not HBD2 is highly upregulated in circulating monocytes but returns to baseline levels during chronic infection. HBD1 expression in monocytes can be induced by HIV-1 in vitro, although direct infection may not entirely account for the increase in HBD1 during acute infection. We provide evidence that HIV-1 triggers antiviral IFN-α responses, which act as a potent inducer of HBD1. Our results show the first characterization of induction of an HBD during acute and chronic viral infection in humans. HBD1 has been reported to have low activity against HIV-1 compared to other defensins, suggesting that in vivo induced defensins may not significantly contribute to the robust early antiviral response against HIV-1. These data provide important insight into the in vivo kinetics of HBD expression, the mechanism of HBD1 induction by HIV-1, and the role of HBDs in the early innate response to HIV-1 during acute infection."
4953,0.003,3.0000,"Darunavir boosted by low-dose ritonavir (DRV/r), at a daily dose of 600/100 mg twice a day (bid), has been shown to be superior to alternative highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens for the management of treatment-experienced, HIV-infected adults in the phase IIb POWER trials and the phase III TITAN trial. Economic analyses of different types that have been performed for several countries to investigate the cost effectiveness and budgetary impact of DRV/r 600/100 mg bid for treatment-experienced people living with HIV (PLHIV) based on the clinical data gathered in the POWER and TITAN trials are reviewed for consistency and their value to different decision-makers is assessed. Cost-utility analyses for the USA and several European countries indicate that DRV/r-based HAART is cost effective compared with other standard of care protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens in PLHIV with evidence of PI resistance. For all of these countries, the estimated cost-utility ratio is well below typical benchmark values and these ratios are robust, as demonstrated by one-way sensitivity and variability analyses and multi-way probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Studies using other metrics including the average 1-year drug cost per patient with a plasma HIV-RNA level less than 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks, the incremental drug cost per additional patient with a plasma HIV-RNA level less than 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks, the total (antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral) costs during the first year of treatment, and the total healthcare budget impact during the first 5 years of treatment provided further evidence of the positive economic outcomes with the use of DRV/r in treatment-experienced PLHIV. Different measures of economic outcomes are useful for different types of decision-makers and different types of decisions. In general, the results of these different types of analyses will be consistent with each other. For darunavir, the economic analyses reviewed in this paper demonstrate that the use of DRV/r 600/100 mg bid in the management of HIV-infected, treatment-experienced adults who have failed at least one of the other currently available PIs is cost effective and may be cost saving."
7232,0.003,3.0000,"To assess the role of Mycobacterium tuberculosis disease in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the authors compared survival of tuberculosis patients and controls matched on year of HIV diagnosis and CD4+ lymphocyte count. Patients were selected in the Aquitaine Cohort, which follows, since 1985, all patients infected with HIV, aged more than 13 years, in five hospitals. Time of inclusion of controls was the date of diagnosis of tuberculosis for the corresponding tuberculosis patient. Patients who had received primary prophylaxis against mycobacteria other than tuberculosis were excluded. As of June 30, 1994, 104 tuberculosis patients and 620 controls were selected; they were similar, except for history of intravenous drug use (tuberculosis patients, 51%, vs. controls, 31%) and AIDS-defining opportunistic infection (40 vs. 29%). Survival was shorter in tuberculosis patients than in controls (risk ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.2-2.1) even after controlling for differences at entry. The risk of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or a decrease to fewer than 50 CD4+ cells/mm3 was slightly but not statistically greater in tuberculosis patients than in controls. Tuberculosis disease affected survival but not occurrence of subsequent opportunistic infections or rate of CD4+ count decline. Tuberculosis may be a marker of advanced HIV and may accelerate its course of infection."
1283,0.003,3.0000,"AIDS is an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome defined by a severe depletion of T cells and over 20 conventional degenerative and neoplastic diseases. In the U.S. and Europe, AIDS correlates to 95% with risk factors, such as about 8 years of promiscuous male homosexuality, intravenous drug use, or hemophilia. Since AIDS also correlates with antibody to a retrovirus, confirmed in about 40% of American cases, it has been hypothesized that this virus causes AIDS by killing T cells. Consequently, the virus was termed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and antibody to HIV became part of the definition of AIDS. The hypothesis that HIV causes AIDS is examined in terms of Koch's postulates and epidemiological, biochemical, genetic, and evolutionary conditions of viral pathology. HIV does not fulfill Koch's postulates: (i) free virus is not detectable in most cases of AIDS; (ii) virus can only be isolated by reactivating virus in vitro from a few latently infected lymphocytes among millions of uninfected ones; (iii) pure HIV does not cause AIDS upon experimental infection of chimpanzees or accidental infection of healthy humans. Further, HIV violates classical conditions of viral pathology. (i) Epidemiological surveys indicate that the annual incidence of AIDS among antibody-positive persons varies from nearly 0 to over 10%, depending critically on nonviral risk factors. (ii) HIV is expressed in less than or equal to 1 of every 10(4) T cells it supposedly kills in AIDS, whereas about 5% of all T cells are regenerated during the 2 days it takes the virus to infect a cell. (iii) If HIV were the cause of AIDS, it would be the first virus to cause a disease only after the onset of antiviral immunity, as detected by a positive ""AIDS test."" (iv) AIDS follows the onset of antiviral immunity only after long and unpredictable asymptomatic intervals averaging 8 years, although HIV replicates within 1 to 2 days and induces immunity within 1 to 2 months. (v) HIV supposedly causes AIDS by killing T cells, although retroviruses can only replicate in viable cells. In fact, infected T cells grown in culture continue to divide. (vi) HIV is isogenic with all other retroviruses and does not express a late, AIDS-specific gene. (vii) If HIV were to cause AIDS, it would have a paradoxical, country-specific pathology, causing over 90% Pneumocystis pneumonia and Kaposi sarcoma in the U.S. but over 90% slim disease, fever, and diarrhea in Africa.(viii) It is highly improbable that within the last few years two viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2) that are only 40% sequence-related would have evolved that could both cause the newly defined syndrome AIDS. Also, viruses are improbable that kill their only natural host with efficiencies of 50-100%, as is claimed for HIVs. It is concluded that HIV is not sufficient for AIDS and that it may not even be necessary for AIDS because its activity is just as low in symptomatic carriers as in asymptomatic carriers. The correlation between antibody to HIV and AIDS does not prove causation, because otherwise indistinguishable diseases are now set apart only on the basis of this antibody. I propose that AIDS is not a contagious syndrome caused by one conventional virus or microbe. No such virus or microbe would require almost a decade to cause primary disease, nor could it cause the diverse collection of AIDS diseases. Neither would its host range be as selective as that of AIDS, nor could it survive if it were as inefficiently transmitted as AIDS. Since AIDS is defined by new combinations of conventional diseases, it may be caused by new combinations of conventional pathogens, including acute viral or microbial infections and chronic drug use and malnutrition. The long and unpredictable intervals between infection with HIV and AIDS would then reflect the thresholds for these pathogenic factors to cause AIDS diseases, instead of an unlikely mechanism of HIV pathogenesis."
3119,0.003,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the central nervous system (CNS) results in neuronal damage and apoptosis, and both in vitro models and pathological studies suggest that a variety of neurotoxins released by HIV-infected and -activated macrophages/microglia selectively damage susceptible subsets of neurons. Confirmation of in vitro findings of mechanisms of neurodegeneration and neuronal cell dysfunction in vivo has been approached through detailed pathological analysis of regional structural damage, immunohistochemical detection of selected antigens in damaged cells, and, more recently, analysis of gene expression in whole tissue blocks or pooled populations (hundreds/thousands) of microdissected cells. Recently developed techniques of gene expression analysis through antisense mRNA amplification (aRNA) at the single-cell level may offer the potential to study pathways of neuronal cell death and to determine patterns of coordinated gene expression that may more specifically identify susceptible neuronal subclasses in vivo. Utilizing this unique technique, the authors have demonstrated, for the first time, RNA amplification and gene expression profiling in individual deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-reactive neurons microdissected from fixed, archival human brain tissue. RNA amplification was successful in >80% of TUNEL-positive neurons, and quantitative aRNA/cDNA hybridization slot-blot analysis demonstrated similar levels of actin RNA but significant differences in caspase-2 RNA expression between TUNEL-reactive and -nonreactive neurons. Reliable quantitative comparisons were achieved with modest numbers of sampled neurons (approximately 10). These studies suggest that analysis of coordinated gene expression in individual damaged neurons in vivo can be reliably used to identify neuronal subclasses that express certain susceptibility- or survival-promoting genes that may be targeted for more specific neuroprotective strategies against HIV."
1656,0.003,3.0000,"One thousand one hundred fifty-two HIV-1-positive patients were screened for HTLV-2 infection, and the AIDS-free coinfected individuals were consecutively included in a longitudinal study with the aim of investigating the role of HTLV-2 in the progression to AIDS and the development of specific neurologic diseases. Two matched HIV-1-positive/HTLV-2-negative controls for each coinfected individual were also enrolled in the study. HTLV-2 infection was found in 95 (8.2%) of the HIV-1-positive patients, 30 of whom were followed up for a median of 28.5 months. No significant differences were observed between them and the patients infected with HIV-1 alone in terms of the rate of decline in CD4 cell counts, progression to AIDS, or AIDS mortality, but they had an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (hazard ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-8.0; p =.009). One coinfected patient developed myelopathy during the follow-up. In the second part of the study, aimed at preliminarily assessing the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the incidence of peripheral neuropathy, we extended our observations to two groups of coinfected and singly infected individuals receiving HAART. An 80% decrease in incidence of peripheral neuropathy was observed among both groups without any significant difference between them. These results support the hypothesis that HTLV-2 plays a role in the development of neurologic abnormalities in HIV-1-infected patients and suggest that the immune reconstitution due to HAART may limit the activity of HTLV-2 as an opportunistic agent."
8321,0.003,3.0000,"Previous research has been inconsistent in documenting a strong relationship between depression and HIV/AIDS, although a recent meta-analysis of studies examining this issue indicates that rates of depression are modestly higher for this population. For the current study, conducted from 2001-2004, we sought to examine rates and types of depressive symptoms in a cohort of patients receiving HIV care at two urban medical centers. These patients were participants in an intervention study examining adherence and mental health in persons triply diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders, and HIV/AIDS. Nearly three quarters of these participants were people of color, two thirds described their sexual orientation as heterosexual, and the vast majority were unemployed. We sought to examine the relationship of depression to patients' adherence to antiretroviral medication regimens (highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]). Results obtained from structured clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires indicated that study participants experienced high rates of depressive symptoms, and that 72.9% of participants met criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). The results of this study offer a detailed view of the incidence and nature of MDDs and depressive symptoms for an urban sample of substance-abusing adults with HIV/AIDS. Given the degree to which depressive symptoms and MDD appear to be prevalent for this group, as well as the observation that these symptoms are amenable to treatment, future research should focus on identifying helpful strategies and interventions for treating these symptoms, effective ways of providing linkages to care, and ways in which standardized assessment and treatment protocols might be adapted to better suit this population."
8717,0.003,3.0000,"HCV exists within its host as pools of related genetic variants referred to as quasispecies. The hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of the E2 envelope gene is subjected to strong selective pressure from neutralizing antibodies. The genetic complexity of this region is defined as the total number of genetic variants within the quasispecies population. The genetic complexity of the HVR1 region was examined in patients with chronic hepatitis C and its relationship with the epidemiology of HCV infection, and its influence on liver disease and the response to interferon treatment were determined in 114 patients with chronic hepatitis C. The genetic complexity of the HVR1 major variants was measured before treatment by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique, and was compared with epidemiological, clinical, virological and histological features. The patients were treated with 3 megaunits of interferon (IFN) alfa for 3 to 6 months and the response to treatment was assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months. The HVR1 could be studied in 101 of the 114 patients (89%). Genetic complexity was significantly higher in patients infected through blood transfusion than intravenous drug use (mean complexity index: 5.7 +/- 2.3 vs. 4.7 +/- 1.5, respectively; P = 0.04). This relationship was independent of age and the estimated time since infection. No significant relationship was found with other parameters of infection or liver disease. In univariate analysis, the genetic complexity of HVR1 major variants did not affect the rates of ALT normalization at months 3 and 6 of IFN treatment. HVR1 genetic complexity was lower in patients with a sustained virological response than in non-responders (4.0 +/- 1.7 vs. 5.4 +/- 2.0, respectively; P = 0.07). In multivariate analysis of pretreatment parameters associated with a sustained virological response to treatment, three parameters appeared to be independent predictors of such a response: a low viral load (P < 0.04), a low anti-HCV core IgM titer (P = 0.03) and a low genetic complexity of HVR1 major variants (P < 0.04). In conclusion, the HVR1 of HCV has a quasispecies distribution in infected individuals. Its genetic complexity is significantly higher in transfusion recipients than in intravenous drug users, suggesting that the size of the initial inoculum affects the later emergence and development of viral quasispecies. The genetic complexity of HVR1, together with viral load and the anti-HCV IgM titer, are independent predictors of a sustained virological response to IFN alfa in patients with chronic hepatitis."
4359,0.003,3.0000,"The objective of this study was a comprehensive analysis of the immune-driven evolution of viruses of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) clade B in a large patient cohort treated at a single hospital in Germany and its implications for antiretroviral therapy. We examined the association of the HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 alleles with the emergence of mutations in the complete protease gene and the first 330 codons of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene of HIV-1, studying their distribution and persistence and their impact on antiviral drug therapy. The clinical data for 179 HIV-infected patients, the results of HLA genotyping, and virus sequences were analyzed using a variety of statistical approaches. We describe new HLA-associated mutations in both viral protease and RT, several of which are associated with HLA-DRB1. The mutations reported are remarkably persistent within our cohort, developing more slowly in a minority of patients. Interestingly, several HLA-associated mutations occur at the same positions as drug resistance mutations in patient viruses, where the viral sequence was acquired before exposure to these drugs. The influence of HLA on thymidine analogue mutation pathways was not observed. We were able to confirm immune-driven selection pressure by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II alleles through the identification of HLA-associated mutations. HLA-B alleles were involved in more associations (68%) than either HLA-A (23%) or HLA-DRB1 (9%). As several of the HLA-associated mutations lie at positions associated with drug resistance, our results indicate possible negative effects of HLA genotypes on the development of HIV-1 drug resistance."
7695,0.003,3.0000,"Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy is an important intervention to prevent the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV and to promote maternal health. Early initiation of ART is particularly important to achieve viral suppression rapidly before delivery. However, current approaches to start ART in pregnancy may be problematic in many settings, with referrals between antenatal care (ANC) and ART services, and delays for patient preparation before ART initiation. These steps contribute to a sizable proportion of women failing to receive adequate duration of ART before delivery, increasing the risk of MTCT. To address these limitations, we developed the rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy (RAP) programme. The programme featured the use of point-of-care CD4 testing to identify ART-eligible women with CD4 cell counts ≤ 350 cells/µl; immediate ART initiation in women on the same day that eligibility was determined, if possible; and intensive counselling and support for ART initiation during the first few weeks on ART. We implemented RAP in an antenatal clinic setting in Cape Town South Africa. Between February and August 2011, a total of 221 HIV-infected women were referred to the programme for CD4 cell count testing and 101 (46%) were eligible for ART. Of these, 98 women (97%) started therapy during pregnancy, 89 (91%) on the day of referral to the service. In-depth interviews suggested that although there were substantial challenges facing HIV-infected women initiating ART in pregnancy, the availability of immediate services and counselling support played an important role in addressing these. While further research is needed, this evaluation demonstrates that a novel service delivery approach may facilitate rapid ART initiation in pregnancy."
1314,0.003,3.0000,"Patient self-reported outcomes are increasingly important in measuring disease, treatment and care outcomes. It is unclear what constitutes well-being using a combined biomedical and psychosocial approach for patients with antiretroviral therapy (ART) access. This study aimed to determine the variance within the visual analogue scale (VAS) measure of health status using the existing five dimensions of the EuroQOL-5D, to identify which domains have the greatest effect on self-reported health status and to identify associations with the VAS using both biomedical and psychosocial factors among HIV outpatients. Consecutive patients in five UK clinics were recruited to a cross-sectional survey, n=778 (86% response rate). Patients self-completed validated measures, with treatment variables extracted from file. On the EuroQOL-5D, nearly one-third (28.1%) had mobility problems, one-fifth (18.7%) self-care problems, one-third (37.4%) difficulty in performing usual tasks and one-half (44.4%) reported pain/discomfort. In the regression model to determine associations with self-reported health status (VAS score), neither CD4 count nor ART status was associated with the outcome. However, in addition to four dimensions of the EuroQOL-5D, poorer health status was associated with worse physical symptom burden, treatment optimism and psychological symptoms. There is a relatively high prevalence of psychological morbidity and poor physical function, and these burdens of disease are associated with worse self-reported health status. As HIV management focuses on treatment for extended survival and a chronic model of disease, clinical attention to physical and psychological dimensions of patient care are essential to achieve optimal well-being."
8027,0.003,3.0000,"Parasitic infections continue to take their toll on HIV positive patients by influencing the blood qualitatively and quantitatively. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in relation to anaemia and CD4 counts among HIV-infected patients in Benin City, Nigeria. Using a serial sampling method, a total of 2000 HIV-infected patients were recruited on their first visit prior to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital from August 2007 to August 2009. Stool and blood samples were collected from each patient. The stool samples were processed using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique to microscopically identify the oocysts of Cryptosporidium species, Isospora belli, Cyclospora species and spores of Microsporidium species while saline and iodine preparations were used for identifying the ova, cysts and parasites of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Taenia spp and other parasites. The blood specimens were equally analyzed using the flow cytometry for CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and autoanalyzer - sysmex kx - 21 for haemoglobin concentration. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 93.3% while 18% had parasitic infections. There was a significant relationship between CD4 count <200cells/microL and anaemia (P<0.0001). Cryptosporidium species (P= 0.005), A. lumbricoides (P=0.035), hookworm and Taenia species (P=0.014) were associated with anaemia. Anaemia was associated with CD4 count while Cryptosporidium species, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species were the intestinal parasitic agents associated with anaemia. In conclusion the prevalence of anaemia in HIV-infected patients is high low CD4 count is a significant risk factor of acquiring anaemia. Except for isosporiasis, cryptosporidiosis, A. lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species in HIV infected individuals are parasitic agents associated with anaemia. Routine screening for intestinal parasites and holistic management of anaemia is advocated."
7071,0.003,3.0000,"Efavirenz (EFV) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor indicated for treatment of HIV-1 infection. Despite concern over EFV tolerability in clinical trials and practice, particularly related to central nervous system (CNS) adverse events, some observational studies have shown high rates of EFV continuation at one year and low rates of CNS-related EFV substitution. The objective of this study was to further examine the real-world rate of CNS-related EFV discontinuation in antiretroviral therapy naïve HIV-1 patients. This retrospective cohort study used a nationally representative electronic medical records database to identify HIV-1 patients ≥12 years old, treated with a 1st-line EFV-based regimen (single or combination antiretroviral tablet) from 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2013. Patients without prior record of EFV use during 6-month baseline (i.e., antiretroviral therapy naïve) were followed 12 months post-medication initiation. CNS-related EFV discontinuation was defined as evidence of a switch to a replacement antiretroviral coupled with record of a CNS symptom within 30 days prior, absent lab evidence of virologic failure. We identified 1742 1st-line EFV patients. Mean age was 48 years, 22.7% were female, and 8.1% had a prior report of CNS symptoms. The first year, overall discontinuation rate among new users of EFV was 16.2%. Ten percent of patients (n = 174) reported a CNS symptom and 1.1% (n = 19) discontinued EFV due to CNS symptoms: insomnia (n = 12), headache (n = 5), impaired concentration (n = 1), and somnolence (n = 1). The frequency of CNS symptoms was similar for patients who discontinued EFV compared to those who did not (10.3 vs. 9.9%; P = .86). Our study found that EFV discontinuation due to CNS symptoms was low, consistent with prior reports."
7018,0.003,3.0000,"Despite the improvements in the prognosis associated with the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), more than 410,000 people in the United States were reported to have died from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) by the end of 1998. The number of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and AIDS in the United States continues to increase, estimated at more than 370,000 in 1998, and there is good reason for optimism that HIV infection may be a controllable disease in many people. Nevertheless, an estimated 27,000 persons still died of AIDS in the United States in 1997, and AIDS is still a leading cause of death in the age group 25 to 44 years. Despite the dramatic treatment advances for HIV infection and improving survival following an AIDS diagnosis, many patients still present with life-threatening complications of HIV infection for three major reasons. Highly active antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii and other infections are not effective in all patients, despite rigorous adherence to treatment. Others adhere to these therapies poorly. Finally, many patients present with advanced disease, unaware that they have HIV infection until they develop a serious opportunistic infection. Therefore, the AIDS epidemic and its burden of illness will continue, and decisions regarding the appropriateness of intensive care for individual patients will be inevitable. The impact of AIDS in Africa and Asia is far more devastating than in the United States and Europe, and most HIV-infected persons in the world live in the underdeveloped nations where intensive care is often unavailable. This article will deal with intensive care in patients with HIV in developed nations."
6241,0.003,3.0000,"The recent availability of CCR5 antagonists as anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) therapeutics has highlighted the need to accurately identify CXCR4-using variants in patient samples when use of this new drug class is considered. The Trofile assay (Monogram Biosciences) has become the method that is the most widely used to define tropism in the clinic prior to the use of a CCR5 antagonist. By comparison, the MT-2 assay has been used since early in the HIV epidemic to define tropism in clinical specimens. Given that there are few data from direct comparisons of these two assays, we evaluated the performance of the plasma-based Trofile assay and the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based MT-2 assay for the detection of CXCR4 use in defining the tropism of HIV isolates derived from clinical samples. The various samples used for this comparison were derived from participants of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV infection and AIDS who underwent consecutive MT-2 assay testing of their PBMCs at approximately 3-month intervals. This unique sample set was specifically selected because consecutive MT-2 assays had demonstrated a shift from negative to positive in PBMCs, reflecting the first emergence of CXCR4-using virus in PBMCs above the level of detection of the assay in these individuals. Trofile testing was performed with clonal HIV type 1 (HIV-1) variants (n = 21), MT-2 cell culture-derived cells (n = 20) and supernatants (n = 42), and plasma samples (n = 76). Among the clonal HIV-1 variants and MT-2 cell culture-derived samples, the results of the Trofile and MT-2 assays demonstrated a high degree of concordance (95% to 98%). Among consecutive plasma samples, detection of CXCR4-using virus was at or before the time of first detection by the MT-2 assay in 5/10 patients by the original Trofile assay and in 9/10 patients by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay. Differences in the time to the first detection of CXCR4 use between the MT-2 assay (PBMCs) and the original Trofile assay (plasma) were greatly reduced by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay, suggesting that sensitivity for the detection of minor CXCR4-using variants may be a more important determinant of discordant findings than compartmentalization. The similarities in performance of the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile and MT-2 assays suggest that either may be an appropriate methodology to define tropism in patient specimens."
5546,0.003,3.0000,"People living with HIV who are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) are increasingly involved in 'positive prevention' initiatives. These are generally oriented to promoting abstinence, 'being faithful' (partner reduction) and condom use (ABC). We conducted a longitudinal qualitative study with people living with HIV using ART, who were provided with adherence education and counselling support by a Ugandan non-governmental organisation, The AIDS Support Organisation (TASO). Forty people were selected sequentially as they started ART, stratified by sex, ART delivery mode (clinic- or home-based) and HIV progression stage (early or advanced) and interviewed at enrollment and at 3, 6, 18 and 30 months. At initiation of ART, participants agreed to follow TASO's positive-living recommendations. Initially poor health prevented sexual activity. As health improved, participants prioritised resuming economic production and support for their children. With further improvements, sexual desire resurfaced and people in relationships cemented these via sex. The findings highlight the limitations of HIV prevention based on medical care/personal counselling. As ART leads to health improvements, social norms, economic needs and sexual desires increasingly influence sexual behaviour. Positive prevention interventions need to seek to modify normative and economic influences on sexual behaviour, as well as to provide alternatives to condoms."
8225,0.003,3.0000,"HIV-1 evolution and the possible emergence of mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral inhibitors have been evaluated in a cohort of sixty-three patients successfully treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The patients under effective HAART were recruited in three different hospitals in Spain, and none of them had been treated (naïve) before entering this study. HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined, and nucleotide sequences of proviral regions encoding protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) were obtained for longitudinal blood samples spanning a mean follow-up period of 88 weeks. Phylogenetic reconstructions and calculations of genetic distances among the different sequences of each patient were performed. All except one of the patients under study showed an early and sustained decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA to levels that were below 200 copies/ml. The plasma viral decline paralleled a significant increase in the CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. Amino acid sequence analyses revealed the occurrence of mutations associated with antiretroviral resistance in nine patients (14.3%) during HAART treatment, that in some cases could be attributed to excess G to A transitions. In six of the nine patients, the mutations conferred resistance to inhibitors administered in the treatment regime, although the mutations did not result in treatment failure. Sequence comparisons revealed viral evolution during the period of treatment in 47.5% of the patients. The results indicate successful suppression of HIV-1 under HAART for extended time periods, indistinguishable for patients in which evidence of virus evolution could or could not be documented."
7278,0.003,3.0000,"Recently increased availability of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has mitigated HIV-1/AIDS prognoses especially in resource poor settings. The emergence of ART resistance-associated mutations from non-suppressive ART has been implicated as a major cause of ART failure. Reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI)-resistance mutations among 12 non-subtype B HIV-1-infected children with treatment failure were evaluated by genotypically analyzing HIV-1 strains isolated from plasma obtained between 2001 and 2004. A region of pol-RT gene was amplified and at least five clones per sample were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed HIV-1 subtype A1 (n = 7), subtype C (n = 1), subtype D (n = 3), and CRF02_AG (n = 1). Before treatment, 4 of 12 (33.3%) children had primary RTI-resistance mutations, K103N (n = 3, ages 5-7 years) and Y181C (n = 1, age 1 year). In one child, K103N was found as a minor population (1/5 clones) before treatment and became major (7/7 clones) 8 months after RTI treatment. In 7 of 12 children, M184V appeared with one thymidine-analogue-associated mutation (TAM) as the first mutation, while the remaining 5 children had only TAMs appearing either individually (n = 2), or as TAMs 1 (M41L, L210W, and T215Y) and 2 (D67N, K70R, and K219Q/E/R) appearing together (n = 3). These results suggest that ""vertically transmitted"" primary RTI-resistance mutations, K103N and Y181C, can persist over the years even in the absence of drug pressure and impact RTI treatment negatively, and that appearing patterns of RTI-resistance mutations among non-subtype B HIV-1-infected children could possibly be different from those reported in subtype B-infected children."
9016,0.003,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) gene sequences obtained during antiretroviral resistance testing with a commercial genotyping assay (Tru Gene; Bayer Corp.) were analyzed to assess the utility of these data for detecting and characterizing non-subtype-B HIV-1 strains. A total of 125 viral sequences obtained from patients believed to have acquired their HIV-1 infection in Africa were analyzed, of which 121 were determined to belong to non-B subtypes. Utilizing Tru Gene sequence data alone, 92 (76%) of these viruses could be subtyped by conventional phylogenetic analysis. The addition of supplemental RT sequence data enabled a further 28 (23.1%) viruses to be classified, while one (0.9%) sample could not be classified conclusively. Two internet-accessible databases that generate HIV-1 subtypes from PR and RT sequences (HIV-SEQ and Geno 2 Pheno) were also evaluated, and both achieved 88% concordance (106/120) with phylogenetic analysis. Non-subtype-B and B-subtype HIV-1 sequences could be readily discriminated by tallying silent polymorphisms listed on the Tru Gene research report. The mean number of silent polymorphisms in the non-B HIV-1 sequences identified in this study was 58.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.1 to 75.5), compared with 20.7 (95% CI, 9.9 to 31.5) for the four subtype B viruses in the study cohort and 118 case-matched B-subtype controls. Sequence data generated in the Tru Gene HIV-1 genotyping assay could, therefore, provide a ready means of tracking the prevalence and identity of non-B subtypes in HIV-1-infected populations undergoing routine antiretroviral resistance testing."
6915,0.003,3.0000,"Our aim was to characterize for the first time the genetic diversity of HIV in Cape Verde Islands as well as the drug resistance profiles in treated and untreated patients. Blood specimens were collected from 41 HIV-1 and 14 HIV-2 patients living in Santiago Island. Half of the patients were on antiretroviral treatment (ART). Pol and env gene sequences were obtained using in-house methods. Phylogenetic analysis was used for viral subtyping and the Stanford Algorithm was used for resistance genotyping. For HIV-1, the amplification of pol and env was possible in 27 patients (66%). HIV-1 patients were infected with subtypes G (13, 48%), B (2, 7%), F1 (2, 7%), and CRF02_AG (2, 7%), and complex recombinant forms including a new C/G variant (n=8, 30%). Drug resistance mutations were detected in the PR and RT of three (10%) treated patients. M41L and K103N transmitted drug resistance mutations were found in 2 of 17 (12%) untreated patients. All 14 HIV-2 isolates belonged to group A. The origin of 12 strains was impossible to determine whereas two strains were closely related to the historic ROD strain. In conclusion, in Cape Verde there is a long-standing HIV-2 epidemic rooted in ROD-like strains and a more recent epidemic of unknown origin. The HIV-1 epidemic is caused by multiple subtypes and complex recombinant forms. Drug resistance HIV-1 strains are present at moderate levels in both treated and untreated patients. Close surveillance in these two populations is crucial to prevent further transmission of drug-resistant strains."
4023,0.003,3.0000,"The number of HIV-infected individuals with prior multiple treatment failures is increasing as time passes by. The success of antiretroviral therapy in these patients is often compromised by the selection of drug-resistant viruses. Despite initial concerns, a rebound in AIDS cases among heavily treatment-experienced patients failing virologically their antiretroviral therapy has not occurred yet. In a multicenter study conducted in Spain, HIV-infected patients were assessed with prior failure to antiretrovirals from the three main drug families who presented during the last semester of the year 2003 with plasma HIV-RNA values above 1,000 copies/ml, despite good treatment adherence. The relationships between CD4+ T cell counts, viral loads and drug-resistant genotypes were examined. A total of 273 patients were identified in 12 centers (78% male, median age: 41 years). The mean viral load was 50,438 copies/ml and the mean CD4+ count was 328 cells/mul. Only 19.5% had less than 200 CD4+ T cells/mul. Most patients (95%) were receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) in their last antiretroviral regimen, while 63% were treated with protease inhibitors (PI) and 27% on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Overall, 97.4% had at least one drug resistance mutation (87.2% for NRTI, 68.5% for NNRTI, and 92.7% for PI). Using the virtual phenotype, resistance to three or more drugs within each class was recognized in 45.8% for NRTI, 40.7% for NNRTI, and 44.7% for PI. Moreover, cross-resistance to compounds from two or three drug families was recognized in 41% and 19.4% of patients, respectively. Nearly half of the patients had plasma HIV-RNA below 10,000 copies/ml and they showed significantly higher CD4 + counts than those with greater viremia (408 versus 259 cells/mul; P < 0.001). Patients with higher plasma viremia had significantly more drug resistance mutations than those with lower viremia. No favorable effect on viral load could be recognized for individual drug resistance mutations known to reduce viral fitness in vitro (i.e., rtM184V, rtL74V, rtK65R, proD30N, or proI50L). In summary, a large proportion of treatment-experienced patients failing their current antiretroviral regimen carry viruses with broad cross-resistant genotypes. Nearly half of the patients with these multi-drug resistant viruses had < 10,000 HIV-RNA copies/ml and 80% have more than 200 CD4 + T cells/mul. Thus, maintaining treatment HIV-infected individuals failing virologically and harboring drug-resistant viruses might ameliorate immunological deterioration until new drugs became available. J. Med.

9132,0.003,3.0000,"During recent years, a controversial discussion has emerged in the medical community on the real number and possible public health implications of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmissions from infected medical staff to susceptible patients. We report here on molecular virological and epidemiological analyses involving 229 patients who underwent exposure-prone operations by an HCV-infected orthopedic surgeon. Of the 229 individuals affected, 207 could be tested. Three were positive for HCV antibodies. Molecular and epidemiological investigation revealed that two of them were not infected by the surgeon. The third patient, a 50-year-old man, underwent complicated total hip arthroplasty with trochanteric osteotomy. He harbored an HCV 2b isolate that in phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable region 1 (HVR 1) was closely related to the HCV strain recovered from the infected surgeon, indicating that HCV-provider-to-patient transmission occurred intraoperatively. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of HCV transmission by an orthopedic surgeon. The recorded transmission rate of 0.48% (95% confidence interval: 0.09-2.68%) was within the same range reported previously for the spread of hepatitis B virus during orthopedic procedures. Since the result of our investigation sustains the notion that patients may contract HCV from infected health-care workers during exposure-prone procedures, a series of further retrospective exercises is needed to assess more precisely the risk of HCV provider-to-patient transmission and to delineate from these studies recommendations for the guidance and management of HCV-infected medical personnel."
5477,0.003,3.0000,"The aim of this study was to determine hepatitis co-infection in a cohort of HIV infected patients at their inclusion in the Senegalese Initiative of ART Access. B, C, and D Hepatitis viruses serological markers were checked retrospectively on 363 stored plasma. For HBV, the Abbott laboratories equipment IMx was used to detect HBs Ag and anti Core Ab on negative HBs Ag samples. For HDV, anti Delta Ab was performed using the Abbott Murex Kit on all HBs Ag positive samples. For HCV, anti HCV Ab was detected by IMx as double screening test and confirmed by INNO-LIA(TM) HCV Core of Innogenetics laboratories. The statistical analysis was done with STATA V8. The study population was composed of 164 men and 199 women aged between 16 and 66 years. The immune and virological markers averages at their enrollment were 154 cell/mm(3) for TLCD4+ (n = 355 patients) and 4.9 log for viral load (n = 277 patients). HBs Ag was found in 61 patients or 16.8% and the prevalence of anti-HBc Ab was 83.2% (252/295). 2 patients or 3% on HBs Ag positive sample presents HBV/HDV co-infection Ab anti HCV was detects in 6 patients or 1.6% after confirmation and 2 patients had triple infection with HBV. These results showed that the prevalence of HBV and HCV in the population of persons living with HIV/AIDS in Senegal is similar to that found in the general population. Our data indicated that hepatitis pathology in the PLwHIV was essentially due to HBV. Further studies are needed to diagnose occult hepatitis in order to set up therapeutic strategies taking into account co-infections by hepatitis viruses in the ART programmes."
3352,0.003,3.0000,"Psychosocial conditions such as depression, intimate partner violence (IPV), and history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) have been associated with poor HIV-related outcomes. In India, which has the third largest HIV epidemic in the world, little is understood about the impact of psychosocial conditions on people living with HIV (PLHIV). We aimed to understand the prevalence and correlates of psychosocial conditions among PLHIV entering into HIV care at the Y.R. Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education in Chennai, India. Thirteen questions were added to the standard voluntary counseling and testing questionnaire, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (a depression scale) and questions assessing for CSA and IPV. We fitted logistic regression models, stratified by gender, with psychosocial condition as the outcome of interest and substance use variables and socio-demographic variables as the correlates of interest. Three hundred and eighty-three persons were enrolled into the study; of these, 253 (66%) tested positive for HIV, including 149 men and 104 women, and were included in the models. More than one-quarter (28%) of the men and 19% of the women reported at least one psychosocial condition (probable depression, CSA, or IPV). In adjusted analysis, current alcohol use was associated with greater than two times higher odds of a psychosocial condition (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.24, 95% CI, 1.04-4.85) among men. In conclusion, we estimated the prevalence of probable depression, CSA, and IPV among PLHIV presenting for HIV care in southern India and found that, among male PLHIV, alcohol use was associated with a markedly higher odds of reporting a psychosocial condition. Further study is needed to characterize alcohol use among male PLHIV and the possible deleterious impact of psychosocial conditions and alcohol use on HIV-related outcomes in India."
3849,0.003,3.0000,"Human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) infections are associated with Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS), Multiple Castleman disease and primary effusion lymphoma, and particularly important in HIV/AIDS and transplantation patients. The aim of this prospective study was to detect HHV-8 prevalence in HIV-1-infected patients,in a Turkish population. A total of 85 anti-HIV-1 positive patients (53 male, 32 female; age range: 1-70 years) diagnosed at Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology Department were included in the study. In 45 (53%) of the patients HIV-RNA was detectable and viral loads were between 20-10.000.000 copies/ml. HHV-8-specific IgG antibodies were screened by using a commercial ELISA kit (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc, USA), and the presence of HHV-8 nucleic acids were investigated by PCR (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) in the blood samples obtained from patients. HHV-8 IgG was detected in 28.2% (24/85) of the anti-HIV-1 positive patients, and HHV-8 DNA was detected in 3.5% (3/85). One of the three HHV-8 DNA positive cases was seropositive as well. Twenty-five percent of the seropositive patients were female (6/24) and 75% were male (18/24). Of three HHV-8 DNA positive cases, two were male and one was female. The distribution of HHV-8 seropositivity rates according to the age groups were as follows; 1/3 for 1-10 years, 1/2 for 11-20 years, 3/8 for 21-30 years, 7/27 for 31-40 years, 9/30 for 41-50 years, 1/9 for 51-60 years, and 2/6 for 61-70 years. The highest seropositivity rate was detected in 41-50 age group (9/24, 37.5%), followed by 31-40 age group (7/24, 29.2%), presenting statistically significant differences between the other age groups (p< 0.05). HHV-8 DNA was detected in only 1 (4.2%) out of 24 IgG seropositive patients. HIV viral loads of the two HHV-8 seronegative patients whose HHV-8 DNA levels of < 500 copy/ml, were < 20 copy/ml and 1250 copy/ml, respectively. HIV-RNA load of the other patient with HHV-8 IgG positivity and 2240 copy/ml of HHV-8 DNA, was 191.000 copy/ml. None of the HIV-1 positive patients presented with clinical symptoms for KS. However, clinical and virological follow-up of those cases with HHV-8 IgG and/or DNA positivity would be useful to predict and control of a possible development of KS or other HHV-8-related pathologies. For a more comprehensive understanding of HHV-8 epidemiology in Turkey, multicentre studies with higher number of cases are needed. "
3990,0.003,3.0000,"A year ago, the New Jersey case of William H. Behringer, the surgeon with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused health experts to focus on health care workers infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and to call for new policies and guidelines to protect patients against infection. After a year of acrimonious debate over the proper approach to the issues discussed in Behringer, no consensus has emerged. The Centers for Disease Control has quietly abandoned its plan to ease its July 1991 guidelines that call for infected professionals to cease performing invasive procedures or disclose their conditions to their patients. It has now decided to let each state set its own rules and regulations in compliance with its guidelines, or risk financial penalties. The issues discussed in Behringer have remained controversial. This case provides an opportunity to identify reasonable actions that may ensure patient safety without inciting public fears, unduly restricting individual freedom, or violating human rights."
5704,0.003,3.0000,"Viral recombination has been postulated to play two roles in the development of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) resistance to antiretroviral drugs. First, recombination has the capacity to associate resistance mutations expressed by distinct viruses, thereby contributing to the development of viruses with improved drug resistance. In addition, recombination could preserve diversity in regions outside those subject to strong selective pressure. In this study, we sought direct evidence for the occurrence of these processes in vivo by evaluating clonal virus populations obtained from the same patient before and after a treatment change that, while unsuccessful in controlling viral replication, led to the emergence of viruses expressing a different profile of resistance mutations. Phylogenetic studies supported the conclusion that the genotype arising after the treatment change resulted from the emergence of recombinant viruses carrying previously existing resistance mutations in novel combinations, whereas alternative explanations, including convergent evolution, were not consistent with observed genotypic changes. Despite evidence for a strong loss of genetic diversity in genomic regions coding for the protease and reverse transcriptase, diversity in regions coding for Gag and envelope was considerably higher, and recombination between the emerging viruses expressing the new pattern of resistance mutations and viral quasispecies in the previously dominant population contributed to this preservation of diversity in the envelope gene. These findings emphasize that recombination can participate in the adaptation of HIV to changing selective pressure, both by generating novel combinations of resistance mutations and by maintaining diversity in genomic regions outside those implicated in a selective sweep."
5040,0.003,3.0000,"A range of quality of life (QOL) measurements specific for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are available. They were, however, developed before or at about the time of introducing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and there has been very little measurement developed from a Chinese perspective. A study was therefore undertaken and we report our findings of the first phase, in which Chinese people living with HIV/AIDS in Hong Kong were asked to explain their perceptions of QOL so as to identify their construct of QOL using a qualitative approach. Thirty-six participants, thirty males and six females, of mixed demographic and disease-related characteristics were recruited through purposive sampling. Following thematic analysis, nine QOL constructs emerged which included perceptions of adaptation and coping, physical health, stigmatization and discrimination, HIV care services, antiretroviral therapy, sexual relationships, relationships with family and friends, work and money, and pleasure and contentment. When comparing these constructs with those of Western populations, they contain more components on focusing psychosocial and spiritual aspects but less on functional status and HIV-related symptoms. The differences may not be attributed by cultural variations alone but also by the dynamic nature of QOL. Since there has been a rapid evolution of HIV medicine, instrument developers may need to regularly review and update measures of QOL. The subjective perceptions and experiences of targeted population should be addressed. Our findings also suggest the need of maintaining tailor-made psychosocial support services for HIV-infected people despite general reduction of morbidity and mortality from HAART."
8513,0.003,3.0000,"Despite the use of laboratory markers in estimating HIV prognosis, significant variation in the natural history of HIV-1 infection remains unexplained. Recent studies suggest psychosocial risk factors have important prognostic significance in HIV disease. The objective of the present study was to examine the prognostic influence of age, general intellectual functioning, and emotional distress across the spectrum of HIV disease progression. The study sample was drawn from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a 13-year, prospective study of HIV-seropositive men recruited from four study centers across the country. The participants were 1,231 HIV-seropositive MACS participants, followed from baseline (median 8/15/87) to the end of the observation period (12/15/98). HIV disease progression was evaluated with respect to three outcome measures: (1) number of years from baseline testing to the first AIDS defining illness (progression to AIDS), (2) years from baseline to HIV-dementia (progression to dementia), and (3) years from baseline to death (survival). The influence of psychosocial risk factors on outcome measures was evaluated using survival analyses. General intellectual functioning, age, and somatic symptoms of depression, were found to be significant predictors of HIV disease progression and survival. Older age at baseline was associated with a more rapid progression to dementia and death. Lower Shipley IQ estimates were associated with a more rapid disease progression (AIDS and dementia) and shortened survival. Somatic symptoms of depression were associated with shortened survival. In addition, age, IQ, and somatic symptoms of depression, had an additive effect with an increase in the number of risk factors associated with accelerated disease progression and shortened time to death. These findings remained consistent, despite controlling for baseline CD4 and HIV medication use. Psychosocial cofactors are important in understanding HIV disease progression. Methods for estimating HIV prognosis may become more reliable if psychosocial factors are considered. Future research will clarify if psychosocial risk factors reflect central nervous system integrity, brain reserve capacity or mediate morbidity and mortality through social economic status, access to health care and other social correlates."
9392,0.003,3.0000,"Isolated reactivity to hepatitis B virus (HBV) core antigen (anti-HBc) is observed relatively frequently in immunocompromised individuals, intravenous drug abusers (IVDA), and in the presence of HCV infection. The reason for the lack of HBsAg is not clear. The aim of the present study was to investigate which factors (genetic variability of S gene, low-level HBsAg, and immune complexes may be responsible for the failure of HBsAg detection with commercial HBsAg screening assays. Dilution series of two recombinant HBsAg escape mutants and dilutions of serum samples from chronic HBV carriers with multiple insertions in the a determinant and different HBsAg subtypes were tested with a highly sensitive assay that detects wild-type HBsAg (Elecsys HBsAg, Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) and two assays that detect HBV wild-type and escape mutants (Murex HBsAg Version 3, Murex and Enzygnost HBsAg 5.0, Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany). Elecsys HBsAg showed in comparison to Murex HBsAg Version 3 and Enzygnost HBsAg 5.0 a reduced sensitivity for escape mutant detection. On the other hand, the best performance for HBsAg subtype detection was obtained with Elecsys HBsAg. In the second part of the study, a selected panel of isolated anti-HBc reactive (n = 104) serum samples (AxSYM Core) was submitted to testing by Elecsys HBsAg, Murex HBsAg Version 3, Enzygnost HBsAg 5.0, and HBsAg detection after immune complex dissociation (ICD) and anti-HBs determination with two different assays (AxSYM Ausab and Elecsys Anti-HBs). To assess the specificity of anti-HBc test results, all the samples were tested by a second anti-HBc assay (Elecsys Anti-HBc). Quantitative HBV DNA detection was undertaken with a commercially available HBV PCR assay (Amplicor HBV Monitor). HCV infection was present in 65.4% of anti-HBc only reactive individuals. Five AxSYM Core positive samples were negative by Elecsys Anti-HBc. Overall, 15 (14.4%) AxSYM Ausab negative samples gave positive results with Elecsys Anti-HBs (median value: 21 IU/ml). No low-level HBsAg carrier was detected among the isolated anti-HBc reactive individuals with Elecsys HBsAg. There was no evidence for the presence of immune complexes. Only one sample was repeatedly reactive by the Murex HBsAg, suggesting that the a mutant form of HBsAg was responsible for the isolated anti-HBc reactivity, however neutralisation assay was not interpretable and HBV DNA PCR was negative. Fifteen (14.4%) anti-HBc only positive individuals were HBV DNA carriers with concentrations ranging from 800 to more than >4,000,000 copies of viral DNA/ml. In conclusion, the most probable explanations for isolated anti-HBc reactivity in our study group are a possible interference of HBsAg synthesis by HCV infection (65.4%) and divergence of results of anti-HBs assays (14.4%). There is no evidence for the presence of low-level HBsAg carriers and immune complexes. HBsAg mutants cannot be excluded definitively by the test strategy used in the present evaluation."
191,0.003,3.0000,"Membranous nephropathy (MN) is caused by subepithelial deposition of immune complexes in the glomerular basement membrane, with secondary MN arising in association with infection. In secondary MN caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV), seroconversion has been known to occur after the onset of MN, particularly in children. In patients with high serum concentrations of HBV DNA, treatment with interferon-α2b or a nucleoside analog has been reported to induce seroconversion and suppress HBV-DNA levels. We treated a 7-year-old boy who presented with proteinuria and liver dysfunction. He had a history of HBV infection since shortly after birth, as his mother was HBV-positive, and he was neither vaccinated nor treated with immunoglobulin at birth. Chronic hepatitis related to HBV was diagnosed following percutaneous needle biopsy of the liver. Percutaneous renal biopsy revealed HBV-related glomerulonephritis with diffuse global subepithelial and focal segmental mesangial and subendothelial deposits. Therefore, HBV-associated MN was diagnosed. Treatment with the nucleoside analog lamivudine was started to reduce serum HBV-DNA levels, but lamivudine was discontinued and treatment with entecavir was started at a dosage of 0.5 mg/day after 6 weeks because of possible adverse effects. Tests for HB envelope antibody were positive in week 16 of treatment, and proteinuria had resolved by week 22. Elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were seen with both treatments but were probably attributable to the developing immune response to HBV. In the present case, HBV levels needed to be reduced to: 1) lower elevated serum HBV-DNA titers, which put the patient at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma; and 2) remove the immune complexes causing MN. Use of nucleoside analogs to suppress the HBV load may facilitate early remission of MN, and entecavir therapy did not cause any serious adverse reactions in this case. Given the advent of lamivudine-resistant HBV, entecavir appears promising for patients with elevated serum levels of HBV DNA. "
5927,0.002,2.0000,"Early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) improves health outcomes and prevents HIV transmission. Before 2010, HIV testing was available to inmates in the California state prison system upon request. In 2010, the California Correctional Health Care Services (CCHCS) integrated HIV opt-out screening into the health assessment for inmates entering California state prisons. Under this system, a medical care provider informs the inmate that an HIV test is routinely done, along with screening for sexually transmitted, communicable, and vaccine-preventable diseases, unless the inmate specifically declines the test. During 2012-2013, CCHCS, the California Department of Public Health, and CDC evaluated HIV screening, rates of new diagnoses, linkage to and retention in care, ART response, and post-release linkage to care among California prison inmates. All prison inmates are processed through one of eight specialized reception center facilities, where they undergo a comprehensive evaluation of their medical needs, mental health, and custody requirements for placement in one of 35 state prisons. Among 17,436 inmates who entered a reception center during April-September 2012, 77% were screened for HIV infection; 135 (1%) tested positive, including 10 (0.1%) with newly diagnosed infections. Among the 135 HIV-positive patient-inmates, 134 (99%) were linked to care within 90 days of diagnosis, including 122 (91%) who initiated ART. Among 83 who initiated ART and remained incarcerated through July 2013, 81 (98%) continued ART; 71 (88%) achieved viral suppression (<200 HIV RNA copies/mL). Thirty-nine patient-inmates were released on ART; 12 of 14 who were linked to care within 30 days of release were virally suppressed at that time. Only one of nine persons with a viral load test conducted between 91 days and 1 year post-release had viral suppression. Although high rates of viral suppression were achieved in prison, continuity of care in the community remains a challenge. An infrastructure for post-release linkage to care is needed to help ensure sustained HIV disease control."
7099,0.002,2.0000,"Although in Western Europe and North America the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has declined in patients awaiting renal transplantation, it remains a relevant clinical problem, mainly in patients with a long history of renal replacement therapy (RRT) who may have been infected many years ago. At the same time, a significant proportion of renal transplant recipients (RTR) is at risk for HBV infection in areas with endemic HBV. HBV infection may increase morbidity and mortality in RTR. The majority of long-term studies reported reduced patient survival compared with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative RTR. The risk for morbidity and mortality of HBsAg-positive RTR transplantation is probably related to the extent of pretransplant liver disease. A thorough evaluation, including liver biopsy in many patients, is required to assess the individual HBsAg-positive patient's risk-benefit ratio. The influence of immunosuppressive therapy on HBV replication and HBV-associated complications is not well established and for clinical practice individually tailored immunosuppression is recommended in HBsAg-positive RTR. Careful screening for HBV reactivation in HBsAg-positive RTR and a regular clinical follow-up after renal transplantation (RTX) including liver sonography is required for early detection of HBV-associated complications. With the availability of new antiviral drugs, new options for pre- and posttransplant therapy might improve the prognosis of RTR with chronic HBV infection."
2466,0.002,2.0000,"Our work aimed to examine the potential influence of variants in interleukin/interleukin receptors genes on high-risk (HR-HPV) HPV clearance. Clearance of genital HR-HPV infection was evaluated for 134 HIV-1 seropositive African-American female adolescents from the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) cohort. Genotyping targeted 225 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the exons, 5' untranslated region (UTR) and 3' UTR sequences of 27 immune-related candidate genes encoding interleukin family of cytokines. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the association of type-specific HPV clearance adjusting for time-varying CD4+ T-cell count and low-risk (LR-HPV) HPV co-infections. HR-HPV clearance rates were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with five SNPs (rs228942, rs419598, rs315950, rs7737000, and rs9292618) mapped to coding and regulatory regions in three genes (IL2RB, IL1RN, and IL7R). These data suggest that the analyzed genetic variants in interleukin family of cytokines modulate HR-HPV clearance in HIV-1 seropositive African-Americans that warrants replication."
5811,0.002,2.0000,"HIV accelerates progression of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease. There are conflicting data on the effect of HCV on the risk of HIV progression and CD4 response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Long-term prospective cohort studies are clearly required to resolve these issues. The optimal management of the co-infected patient is also unclear. For the co-infected patient, the optimal HAART regimen for best immune CD4 recovery and least adverse reactions remains unclear. Unfortunately, current HCV treatment is associated with significant side effects and a considerable proportion of HIV co-infected patients are poor candidates for HCV treatment. Better and more effective treatment for HCV (preferably not based on interferon) is urgently required for this group of patients. Patients with good CD4 cell count and with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 are likely to have a reasonable response to treatment."

To test the hypothesis that acquired suppressor cell defects may participate in such a response, we assessed the functional integrity of 2 suppressor cell populations in patients with type B viral hepatitis. Spontaneous suppression of the 1-way mixed lymphocyte response by radiation-resistant, adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells decreases during the acute phase of disease, returns towards normal with clinical recovery, but remains depressed in patients with chronic hepatitis. The degree of spontaneous suppressor cell dysfunction correlates inversely with at least 1 biochemical parameter of hepatocellular injury (SGPT). The functional integrity of this suppressor cell fluctuates during chronic hepatitis and may reflect currently undefined biologic variables in this disease. Mitogen-induced suppression on lymphocyte activation by radiation resistant, nonadherent suppressor cells is also depressed in acute and chronic hepatitis, but it does not correlate with biochemical evidence of hepatocellular injury on an individual-patient basis. Documentation of these generalized defects of nonspecific suppressor cell function establishes a basis for the possible existence of specific anomalies of immuno-regulation that may permit the expression of normally suppressed auoaggressive hepatocytotoxic immune mechanisms in viral hepatitis."
7815,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has many genotypes which are closely associated with the severity of chronic hepatitis and the response to antiviral therapy. Although HCV is essentially hepatotropic, several lines of evidence suggest that this virus can infect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in most patients with chronic HCV infection. However, the methods used previously to detect negative-strand HCV RNA have been questioned, and the PBMC tropism of different HCV genotypes remains unknown. A stringent method was used to investigate the prevalence of positive- and negative-strand HCV RNA in the PBMC of 106 patients with chronic hepatitis C and to analyze the influence of HCV genotype on the tropism of PBMC. HCV type 1b was the predominant strain in the patients. Positive-strand RNA in PBMC was detected in 83 (78%) and 40% had negative-strand RNA. The demographic and clinical features were comparable among different patients grouped by the replication status of HCV in the plasma and PBMC samples. In addition, there was no significant difference of PBMC tropism between type 1b and non-1b HCV. In summary, HCV does indeed infect actively the PBMC of chronic hepatitis C patients and such infection is not correlated to the pathogenesis of liver cell damage. Moreover, the genotype is not associated specifically with PBMC tropism of HCV."
8527,0.002,2.0000,"Data are accumulating to show that the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in chimpanzees closely reproduces that in humans and is influenced by biologic properties of the infecting HIV-1 strain. To determine the distribution and relative amounts of HIV-1, proviral DNA in multiple tissues from a chimpanzee euthanized because of an abdominal tumor and kidney failure was quantified by nested PCR limiting-dilution assays. At death, 21 months after infection with HIV-1(JC499), this animal had a CD4(+) T-cell count of 268 and 1.7 x 10(5) copies of virion RNA/ml of plasma. The highest proviral burdens were in peripheral lymph nodes and blood, followed by lung, colon, and spleen; values ranged from 130 to 3350 proviral copies/microg DNA (equivalent to DNA in 150,000 cells). The lowest levels of virus were in the spinal cord, brain, and cecum (0.3 to 2.5 copies/microg DNA), with all other tissues harboring intermediate levels (6.8 to 114 copies/microg DNA). Viral burdens in all tissues were comparable to or greater than those reported for HIV-1-infected humans in all stages of disease. Immunohistochemistry for HIV-1 p24 Gag antigen revealed (i) trapping of HIV-1 on follicular dendritic cells in lymph node germinal centers and (ii) virus in the brain, where it was localized primarily to capillary endothelial cells in the cerebral cortex. Analysis of the genetic diversity of the Env V3 loop in tissues indicated that there was no apparent compartmentalization of HIV-1 variants. Of interest, in 83 of 94 (88.3%) clones sequenced, the unique GYGR motif at the tip of the V3 loop of HIV-1(JC499) had reverted to the more common GPGR. The results support the conclusion that HIV-1 has the potential to maintain high viral burdens in chimpanzees and to disseminate to most organs, including the central nervous system. The use of the chimpanzee model with HIV-1(JC499) (or related strains) in vaccine efficacy studies should prove valuable, especially when assessing protection against disease. Furthermore, comparison of both replicative properties of HIV-1(JC499) with SIVcpz strains and immune responses of chimpanzees infected with these viruses might provide new information about HIV pathogenesis."
1510,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) production continues in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with undetectable (<50 copies/mL) virus loads. Our initial cross-sectional study showed that this viremia is composed of viruses that lack new resistance mutations to the HAART regimen. Here we describe a longitudinal, clonal genotypic analysis of plasma virus loads in treated adults who had undetectable virus loads. We document a continuous production of virus in 8 HIV-1-infected adults who maintained suppression of viremia for up to 15 months. Using analytical approaches for distinguishing selected resistance mutations from nonselected mutations and polymerase chain reaction errors, we detected no evolution of resistance in the reverse-transcriptase and protease genes. Sporadic resistance mutations were detected in some viral clones that were not selected for subsequently. Thus, in some patients, HAART suppresses replication to a level that does not allow the evolution of drug resistance over a time frame of years."
7773,0.002,2.0000,"Fever of unknown origin (FUO) poses a major diagnostic challenge in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this retrospective study, we sought to assess the clinical utility of percutaneous liver biopsy as a diagnostic aid for FUO in HIV-infected patients and identify the factors associated with a greater likelihood of a positive diagnostic yield form this procedure. A total of 101 HIV-infected patients with FUO, who had undergone percutaneous liver biopsy in an HIV care hospital, served as the study population. The results obtained from percutaneous liver biopsy were categorized into three groups: (i) diagnostic, (ii) helpful, and (iii) not helpful. Diagnostic and helpful results were classified as useful. The mean (SD) age of patients was 37.6 (6.9) years, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) CD4 count was 18 (3-62) cells/mm(3). The median (IQR) duration of fever was 20 (8-30) days. Percutaneous liver biopsy was diagnostic in 51 patients (50.5%), helpful in 12 (11.9%) and not helpful in 38 (37.6%) patients. On multivariate analyses, elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase level (OR 1.27 per one time elevation from the upper normal range; 95% CI, 1.03-1.57; P = 0.023), and fever duration of less than 3 weeks (OR 3.82; 95% CI, 1.03-14.18; P = 0.046) was significantly associated with the likelihood of the biopsy findings being classified as useful. Our study supports the case for percutaneous liver biopsy as a useful diagnostic aid in HIV-infected patients with FUO. "
2093,0.002,2.0000,"Substance P (SP), a member of the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, is an important immunomodulator of lymphocyte and monocyte/macrophage function. We have examined the effects of SP on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in vitro. Human monocytes isolated by Ficoll gradient followed by adherence were maintained in vitro for 10 days and infected with HIV-1. The addition of SP resulted in a 2- to 8-fold-enhanced HIV-1 expression in the MDMs isolated from 7 of 13 healthy donors as determined by reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and p24 protein expression assays, as compared to control cultures incubated with HIV-1 alone. There was no correlation observed, however, between SP-stimulated TNF production and HIV-1 expression in MDMs obtained from a subset of these donors. These effects of SP on HIV-1 expression in MDMs in vitro may have in vivo implications relevant to modulation of monocyte/macrophage functions, to HIV-1 infection of monocytes/macrophages, and to the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 infection."
8561,0.002,2.0000,"In the United States, most reported cases of hepatitis B occur in adults as a result of behavioural, lifestyle, or occupational exposures, but a significant number of children also become infected in well defined settings. Although only 1-3% of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections occur in children under 5 years of age, they account for 20-30% of all chronic infections. A new strategy for HBV prevention in the USA includes integration of HBV vaccine into childhood immunisation schedules. Vaccination strategies that target high risk groups have not been effective. To determine the frequency and severity of community acquired chronic hepatitis C, patients with acute non-A, non-B hepatitis identified in four sentinel counties in the United States were followed prospectively. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was found in 106 (82%) of 130 patients. Ninety three per cent of the HCV positive patients had a risk factor for their infection: 59% parenteral, 6% sexual or household, and 28% low socioeconomic level. Chronic hepatitis developed in 62%, independently of the risk factor for infection. HCV-RNA persisted in most patients, including those with biochemical resolution of their hepatitis. This study suggests that HCV may be a major cause of liver disease and persistent viraemia in the United States."
5616,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Hepatocarcinogenesis is a multistep process mainly associated with persistent infection with hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) viruses and always involving the accumulation of genetic alterations over decades of chronic liver disease. Mutations in TP53 and CTNNB1 genes are considered the cancer drivers for HCC development with variable frequencies depending on the etiology. Here we present a comprehensive review evaluating somatic mutations in TP53 and CTNNB1 genes in HBV- and HCV-related HCCs. Moreover, we report the mutational analysis of TP53 (exons 4-9) and CTNNB1 (exon 3) as well as PIK3CA (exon 9) genes in HCC from Southern Italy. The overall mutation frequency of TP53 and CTNNB1 was 33.3%, while hotspot variations in PIK3CA were completely absent. CTNNB1 mutations were significantly associated with young age (P=0.019) and moderately/poorly differentiated HCV-related HCC (P=0.015). The extended analysis of genetic alterations will help to identify molecular markers for liver cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HBV and HCV-associated liver cancer. "

In Egypt, data about epidemiology, the spectrum of disease, and impact of HDV on HBV infection are rare. To assess the prevalence, clinical and virological characteristics of HDV infection among Egyptian patients with chronic HBV. Adult patients with Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive were evaluated for the presence of HDV using anti HDV-IgG and HDV RNA by RT-PCR. Routine laboratory investigations, genotypes and subtypes for both HBV and HDV, abdominal sonography, and transient elastography (TE) were done. Liver biopsy was performed only in whenever indicated. One hundred and twenty-one treatment-naïve chronic HBV patients were included. Wild HBV genotype-D2 was found in 98.2% and 81.9% were HBeAg negative. Prevalence of HDV was 8.3% by anti-HDV IgG and 9.9% by RT-PCR. Wild HDV genotype-IIb was reported in 83.3%. HDV infection was more common in males, 90.9% of delta patients were HBeAg negative. Compared to the mono-infected HBV, concomitant HBV/HDV infection was not associated with more derangment in ALT nor advanced stage of fibrosis. 66.7% of HDV patients had significantly lower HBV-DNA level compared to the non-delta patients (P < 0.001). HDV is not uncommon in Egypt. HBV genotype-D was associated with HDV genotype-IIb. Delta infection was associated with negative HBeAg status, reduction of HBV replication, but neither influenced the clinical course nor increased significant liver damage risk."
6896,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) frequently co-exist due to shared routes of transmission. In the past, the impact of HCV on overall morbidity and mortality of coinfected patients was minimal due to the poor prognosis of HIV. However, since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HCV has become a significant pathogen in this population. HIV clearly exacerbates HCV infection and accelerates progression to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is debate over whether HCV influences the natural history of HIV. Given the high prevalence of coinfection and the accelerated liver damage, HCV treatment has become a priority in these patients. There are new data on pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy for HCV in coinfected patients. The therapy is well tolerated and safe, although it appears to be slightly less effective than in monoinfected patients. The risk of HAART-related hepatotoxicity is greater in coinfected patients and therefore requires special consideration and close monitoring."
6955,0.002,2.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has fundamentally changed the clinical outcome of HIV infection and AIDS. However, the emergence of drug-resistant HIV variants is a barrier to successful use of HAART, with resistance to one drug often resulting in cross-resistance to many, if not all, others in the same class. The rise in the incidence of drug-resistant variants among newly infected patients also represents a formidable challenge for clinicians. Failure of the current HAART regimen due to drug resistance can severely limit second-line, third-line, and salvage treatment options. Although inadequate exposure of the virus to antiretroviral agents is a prime reason for the emergence of HIV drug-resistant variants, poor adherence to complicated regimens and variability in drug pharmacokinetics (PK), both within and between HIV-infected individuals, can also affect the overall efficacy of antiretroviral agents, promoting emergence of resistant HIV variants. Recent strategies to optimize antiretroviral drug regimens, including assessment of HIV genotype and/or phenotype, the use of protease inhibitor regimens that incorporate PK boosting, and scheduled treatment interruptions, have been explored. Additionally, several newer antiretroviral agents that produce rapid and sustained virologic and immunologic responses as well as novel resistance profiles (e.g. atazanavir and tenofovir) have become available. These characteristics thus increase the likelihood of durable viral suppression."
3943,0.002,2.0000,"There is evidence that the life expectancy (LE) of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, mortality rates in recent years in HIV-positive individuals appear to have remained higher than would be expected based on rates seen in the general population. A low CD4 count, whether due to late HIV diagnosis, late initiation of cART, or incomplete adherence to cART, remains the dominant predictor of LE, and thus the individual's disease stage at initiation of cART (or thereafter) certainly contributes to these higher mortality rates. However, individuals with HIV also tend to exhibit lifestyles and behaviors that place them at increased risk of mortality, particularly from non-AIDS causes. Thus, although mortality rates among the HIV population may indeed remain slightly higher than those seen in the general population, they may be no higher than those seen in a more appropriately matched control group. Thus, further improvements in LE may now only be possible if some of the other underlying issues (for example, modification of lifestyle or behavioral factors) are tackled."
4658,0.002,2.0000,"Antiretroviral drugs constitute a milestone in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; however, emerging problems limit their long-term use, and an increasing number of patients interrupt the prescribed continuous drug therapy for short or long periods. Some patients appear to benefit from structured treatment interruptions (STI), involving monitored repetition of on-and-off cycles of drugs; however, it is unclear whether patients and/or physicians should consider STI as a treatment option. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive update on the use of STI in clinical settings, and to carefully evaluate the advantages and potential risks for patients infected with HIV. We used a MEDLINE search to find all English-language articles published January 1999 to August 2001 regarding patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy for whom treatment interruption was investigated. Priority was assigned to peer-reviewed sources, when available. Otherwise, abstracts from authoritative international conferences were selected through the AIDSLINE database. Results from various studies with respect to type of drug treatment, baseline patient status, number of treatment interruptions, duration of treatment and interruption, changes in viral load, and immune system parameters were analyzed. Patients could be categorized into 3 distinct clinical scenarios: acute infection, chronic drug-suppressed infection and virological drug failure. The STI approach may offer more benefit during acute infection when the patient's immune system remains nearly intact. It is yet to be determined whether STI will facilitate the long-term management of chronic infection by decreasing drug-associated toxicity and improving quality of life without jeopardizing the efficacy of the treatment. Results from randomized controlled trials and more definitive means of gauging the status of the patient's immune system must be available before this treatment method is extended beyond the research setting. Ultimately, a safer approach using therapeutic immunization or vaccination would be preferable for stimulating vigorous T-cell-mediated immune responses and control of HIV during treatment interruption."
8538,0.002,2.0000,"Enfuvirtide (ENF) is the first of a new class of antiretrovirals (ARVs) known as the HIV fusion inhibitors. Two phase III studies of ENF, TORO 1 and TORO 2, demonstrated that ENF given in combination with optimized background (OB) therapy significantly improved virological response, increased the time to virological failure, and increased CD4-cell count compared with OB alone among highly treatment-experienced patients. The present study investigated the long-term clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of ENF. Outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness were estimated using a Markov model. Viral suppression and immune reconstitution were determined from the outcomes of the clinical trials. Time to immunological failure, time to AIDS-defining event (ADE), and time to death were estimated based on published mathematical models of disease progression. Costs were based on published estimates of the use and costs of ARVs, cost of managing ADEs, and cost of laboratory and other outpatient services. Cost-effectiveness was calculated as the incremental cost per year of life gained, adjusted for quality of life. The combined effects of an increase in CD4 count and delayed time to virological and immunological failure with ENF + OB were predicted to produce a mean life expectancy of 7.4 years from initiation of therapy, which was 1.8 years (1.5 quality-adjusted lifeyears [QALYs]) greater than the life expectancy associated with OB alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness of ENF + OB was estimated to be Dollars 24,604 per QALY. ENF is projected to increase time to immunological failure, delay onset of new AIDS-defining events, and increase life expectancy by more than 1.5 years among treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients. The cost-effectiveness of ENF is comparable to many existing treatment and prevention management strategies for HIV."
9458,0.002,2.0000,"Previous studies suggested that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients at risk of poor adherence were not distinguishable only based on the baseline characteristics. This study is to identify patient characteristics that would be consistently associated with poor adherence across regimens and to understand the associations between initial and long-term adherence. HIV treatment-naïve patients initiated on protease inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or integrase strand transfer inhibitors were identified from the Veteran Health Administration system. Initial adherence measured as initial coverage ratio (ICR) and long-term adherence measured as thereafter 1-year proportion days covered (PDC) of base agent and complete regimen were estimated for each patient. The patients most likely to exhibit poor adherence were African-American, with lower socioeconomic status, and healthier. The initial coverage ratio of base agent and complete regimen were highly correlated, but the correlations between ICR and thereafter 1-year PDC were low. However, including initial adherence as a predictor in predictive model would substantially increase predictive accuracy of future adherence."
684,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain prevalent despite improved antiretroviral therapies. A HAND-specific biomarker indicative of neuropsychological impairment (NPI) would give insight into disease progression and aid clinicians in designing therapy. Endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins such as tumor susceptibility gene (TSG)-101, vacuolar protein sorting (VPS)-4 and LIP-5 are important for HIV replication and recently antiviral interferon stimulated gene (ISG)-15 was proposed as a biomarker for CNS injury. Here, we analyzed a well-characterized cohort of HIV+ cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and postmortem brain specimens for multiple vesicular trafficking proteins and a related innate immune protein, ISG-15, TSG-101, VPS-4 and LIP-5. All protein levels trended higher with increased NPI and neuropathology. ISG-15 CSF levels were increased in HIV encephalitis (HIVE) compared to normal cases, and three quarters of HIVE samples had above average CSF ISG-15 levels. VPS-4 CSF levels were increased in NPI/NPI-O compared to normal patients. VPS-4 CSF levels in HIV-associated dementia were equivalent to that of normal patients. LIP-5 CSF levels positively correlate with ISG-15 levels, and higher than average ISG-15 levels indicate elevated viral load. Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses show increased expression of ISG-15, VPS-4 and LIP-5 in neuronal cell bodies and astroglial cells. ESCRT protein CSF levels analyzed in conjunction with viral load may be indicative of NPI stage, and may aid in the diagnosis and design of therapies for HIV patients. Further studies on the ESCRT protein expression during HIV infection may lead to a promising biomarker for predicting progression of NPI. "
2272,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) seroprevalence is highly diverse among human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected patients, ranging between 10% of HIV-1 infected homo-bisexuel men, to >92% in patients infected with HIV-1 who acquired HIV-1 through intravenous drug use. Thus, being HCV-free while having acquired HIV-1 via intravenous drug use is a rare situation. Claudin-1 is a protein involved in intracellular tight-junctions and has been identified as a major cellular co-receptor for HCV infection. Our objective was to determine whether Claudin-1 gene (CLDN1) mutations might be involved in natural resistance to HCV infection. We conducted a case-control study. All recruited patients acquired HIV-1 infection via intravenous drug use route before 1995. The case study patients remained free from HCV infection (negative anti-HCV antibodies and HCV-RNA). The control study patients was co-infected with HCV (positive anti-HCV antibodies). Direct genomic sequencing of the CLDN1 gene coding region and adjacent intron/exons junctions was performed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A total of 138 Caucasian patients were enrolled. Twenty-two patients (cases) were free from HCV infection and 116 (controls) were co-infected with HCV. We found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) described previously with no significant differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls. In conclusion, despite being a major cellular co-receptor for HCV entry in vitro, we did not identify any specific substitution in CLDN1 gene coding region in our study patients highly exposed but resistant to HCV infection in vivo. Other cellular co-factors involved in HCV infection should be investigated in this highly-exposed intravenous drug users patients."
7054,0.002,2.0000,"Few data are available about the treatment of chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV-infected persons with active drug or alcohol addiction and psychiatric disorders. We report the case of a 42-year-old man who entered care with a CD4+ cell count of 78/microL but was reluctant to take many of the available antiretroviral agents. For many years, periods of sobriety and good adherence to antiretroviral medications were interspersed with relapses to heroin, cocaine, and alcohol use as well as episodes of overdose, major depression with psychiatric hospitalization, incarceration, and discontinuation of antiretroviral medications. After 4 years of HIV primary care, the patient was stabilized to begin therapy for hepatitis C with pegylated interferon and ribavirin with the support of a multidisciplinary team. After starting treatment for hepatitis C, the patient achieved an early virologic response and continues to have an undetectable HCV RNA level by polymerase chain reaction testing and 100% adherence to on-site pegylated interferon injections, without adverse events related to his addiction or psychiatric symptoms. This case suggests that HIV-HCV-coinfected persons with the common comorbidities of polysubstance dependence and psychiatric illness may effectively and safely undergo pharmacotherapy for hepatitis C with appropriate support."
4573,0.002,2.0000,"Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) used for the treatment of HIV-1 inhibit the replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which may contribute to severe mitochondrial toxicity including lipodystrophy, through the inhibition of polymerase gamma (POLG). Polymorphisms of POLG could explain the variation in mitochondrial toxicity in HIV-1-infected patients. We explored the relationship between selected polymorphisms of POLG and lipodystrophy related to NRTIs. We studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at three amino acid residues (R1142, E1143 and R1146) and the CAG repeats of POLG in a case-control study including HIV-1 treated patients with lipodystrophy (n=69) and 2 controls (without lipodystrophy) per case matched by age, race and sex (n=138). Compared with matched controls, the polymorphisms in E1143 were significantly more frequent in case patients with lipodystrophy (aOR=4.7; p=0.048), and this was associated with a significant decrease of mtDNA in PBMC. In addition, among the parameters tested, the conditional logistic regression showed that the lipodystrophy has a strong link with E1143 polymorphisms, associated with D4T treatment (aOR=9.29, p=0.002). In conclusion, patients harbouring the changes of E1143 in the catalytic site of POLG exhibit a 4-fold increased risk to develop lipodystrophy than HIV-1 treated patients who do not have changes in E1143 and this risk can increase if the patient presenting the SNP received D4T. These could be due to decreased content of mtDNA in PBMC in these patients. Therefore, the toxicity of NRTIs leading to lipodystrophy in some HIV-1 infected patients could be explained in part by the occurrence of POLG polymorphisms."
8058,0.002,2.0000,"T cell apoptosis represents a common mechanism of T cell depletion in HIV-1-infected individuals reflecting maturational and functional T cell abnormalities either directly or indirectly induced by the virus. In the present study, the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the spontaneous apoptosis of distinct T cell subsets were investigated during a 6-month follow-up in a cohort of HIV-1-infected individuals with CD4(+) cell counts between 100 and 500 cells/microliter and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels >/=10, 000 copies/ml. We determined that the rapid and sustained increase of both naive (CD45RA(+)CD62L(+)) and memory (CD45R0(+) and CD45RA(+)/CD62L(-)) CD4(+) and, to as lesser extent, CD8(+) T cells in peripheral blood was associated with a significant decrease of apoptotic CD4(+) and CD8(+) as well as CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells. Among CD4(+) lymphocytes, at enrollment, the highest frequency of apoptotic cells was observed within the memory compartment, as defined by CD45R0 expression. During HAART, however, the frequency of CD4(+)CD45R0(+) apoptotic T cells progressively decreased in association with a significant downregulation of surface activation markers that indicated decreased levels of systemic immune stimulation. These results indicate that effective viral suppression can contribute to progressive normalization of maturational and functional T cell abnormalities responsible for the high levels of T cell apoptosis in HIV-1-infected individuals. This, in turn, may contribute to a reduced rate of T cell loss and immune reconstitution during HAART."
376,0.002,2.0000,"The transmission of antiretroviral-resistant HIV-1 strains is associated with suboptimal virological responses to initial antiretroviral therapy. However, certain types of resistance mutations are known to be associated with decreased viral fitness, which confers a lower replication capacity than that of the wild-type virus in the absence of antiretroviral drugs. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between antiretroviral resistance mutations and viral replication in the primary HIV-1 infection (PHI) period. From January 2002 to March 2005, 52 PHI patients were identified in the Republic of Korea. HIV-1 RNA genotyping was performed, and the resistance mutation score was obtained from the HIV Drug Resistance Database of Stanford University. We defined the sum of the average resistance mutation scores (SARMS) for each antiretroviral drug class as a measure of the degree of resistance of any specific strain. The overall mean SARMS was 2.00 +/- 2.74, and the annual mean did not change significantly during the study period. No critical resistance mutation gene was identified in the study group. The SARMS showed a weak negative correlation with the viral load log10 during PHI, but without statistical significance (r = -0.274, p = 0.051). But the mean SARMS of patients with a viral load exceeding 100,000 copies/ml was significantly lower than that of patients with a viral load of less than 100,000 copies/ml (p = 0.03). Evaluation of the potency of antiretroviral resistance revealed a weak negative correlation with viral replication in the PHI period. This could be one reason why the transmission of resistant strains in PHI patients is not increasing significantly despite the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)."
1171,0.002,2.0000,"Tenofovir is an acyclic nucleotide analog with activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF), a bis-alkoxyester prodrug of tenofovir, is approved for the treatment of HIV and is currently being developed to treat chronic hepatitis B. In this report, we further characterize the in vitro activity of tenofovir against HBV as well as its metabolism in hepatic cells. We show that tenofovir is efficiently phosphorylated to tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) in both HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes. TFV-DP has a long intracellular half-life (95 h) and is a potent and competitive inhibitor of HBV polymerase (Ki = 0.18 microM). Tenofovir has a 50% effective concentration of 1.1 microM against HBV in cell-based assays, and potency is improved > 50-fold by the addition of bis-isoproxil progroups. Tenofovir has previously demonstrated full activity against lamivudine-resistant HBV in vitro and clinically. Here we show that the major adefovir resistance mutation, rtN236T, confers three- to fourfold-reduced susceptibility to tenofovir in cell culture; the clinical significance of this susceptibility shift has not yet been determined. The rtA194T HBV polymerase mutation recently identified in tenofovir DF-treated HIV/HBV-coinfected patients did not confer in vitro resistance to tenofovir as a single mutation or in a lamivudine-resistant viral background. Overall, the antiviral and metabolic profile of tenofovir supports its development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B."

In this study a group of 300 patients aged from 18 to 63 years were selected in order to assess the prevalence and consequences of HIV and the hepatitis B (HBV), C (HCV) and D (HDV) viruses coinfections. Study groups were designed for each coinfection. These groups were in turn divided in case groups formed of coinfected participants and control groups consisting of mono-infected participants. This classification was obtained by testing the participants for the presence of specific infection markers using the ELISA technique. As a result, in regard to the HIV/HBV coinfection the study group consisted of 16 coinfected participants and 114 HBV-infected participants resulting in a prevalence of the coinfection of 14%. In the case of the HIV/HDV coinfection the study group consisted of 5 coinfected participants and 45 HDV-infected participants. The prevalence of the HIV/HCV coinfection was 25% out of the 170 HCV-infected participants. The effect of the coinfections on the expression and levels of the infection markers was analyzed in constrast to those encountered in the case of the mono-infection. The observed changes in the expression of the specific hepatitis markers indicate the impact of the coinfection with HIV on the progression of the hepatitis infections. In addition, the inadequate immune response towards the hepatitis viruses in the case of the coinfected participants leads to the development of cirrhosis and end stage liver disease."
4719,0.002,2.0000,"Amino acid substitutions at positions rtN238T/D of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase have been reported as potential mutations associated with adefovir (ADV) resistance. In this study, we characterized the prevalence of the rtN238H mutation and determined the susceptibility to LAM and ADV using phenotypic analyzes in vitro. One thousand eight hundred and sixty-five HBsAg-positive patients with chronic HBV (CHB) infection were included in this study. HBV genotypes and reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations were determined by direct sequencing. Replication-competent HBV constructs containing the naturally occurring rtN238H mutation were generated and replication capacity and susceptibility to LAM and ADV in transiently transfected hepatoma cell lines were determined. Among 1865 enrolled HBV infected patients, 8.8% (165/1865) showed mutations in the rtN238 locus (143 males/22 females, 91 treatment-naive, 42 ADV-treated, 16 LAM-treated and 16 ADV+LAM-treated), namely 86% rtN238H (142/165), 5.5% rtN238S (9/165), 5.5% rtN238T (9/165) and 3% rtN238D (5/165). Among the rtN238H mutant strains, there were no significant differences between ADV- or/and LAM- treated patients and treated-naive patients (42% vs. 58%). Compared with wild-type HBV, this mutant displayed an equivalent susceptibility to LAM or ADV in phenotypic assays. Importantly, we found that the incidence rate of rtN238H was higher in HBV genotype B infected patients than HBV genotype C subsets (80.3% vs. 19.7%), even without exogenous selection pressures. As rtN238H did neither impair the viral replication efficiency nor susceptibility to LAM or ADV in vitro, rtN238H likely represents background polymorphisms rather than resistance mutations with clinical implications. The incidence of rtN238H may be associated with HBV genotype."
4431,0.002,2.0000,"To investigate the prevalence and the associated risk factors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Kunming, 300 MSM were recruited through community-based organizations between September 2014 and January 2015. The prevalence of HIV, HBsAg, syphilis, Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) were 17.0%, 7.7%, 11.3%, 18.2% and 13.2%, respectively. In the three different anatomic sites (urethra, rectum and pharynx), the prevalence of rectal CT was the highest (15.5%), whereas NG was most commonly found in the pharynx (8.1%). Low education level, homosexuality, inconsistent condom use and drug use in the previous six months were significantly associated with HIV infection, whereas the former three factors were also associated with HBV infection.Older people (aged ≥ 40 years) and those who lacked knowledge of STIs, and younger people (aged <30 years) as well as inconsistent condom users were more at risk of syphilis and CT infections, respectively. NG infection was only associated with reported dating venues. Our study revealed a heavy disease burden and multiple risk factors of HIV/STIs among MSM in Kunming. It is necessary to promote regular screening and proactive treatment of HIV/STIs among MSM."
1306,0.002,2.0000,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a lentivirus associated with AIDS-like illnesses in cats. As such, FIV appears to be a feline analog of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A hallmark of HIV infection is the large degree of viral genetic diversity that can develop within an infected individual and the even greater and continually increasing level of diversity among virus isolates from different individuals. Our goal in this study was to determine patterns of FIV genetic diversity by focusing on a 684-nucleotide region encompassing variable regions V3, V4, and V5 of the FIV env gene in order to establish parallels and distinctions between FIV and HIV type 1 (HIV-1). Our data demonstrate that, like HIV-1, FIV can be separated into distinct envelope sequence subtypes (three are described here). Similar to that found for HIV-1, the pairwise sequence divergence within an FIV subtype ranged from 2.5 to 15.0%, whereas that between subtypes ranged from 17.8 to 26.2%. However, the high number of synonymous nucleotide changes among FIV V3 to V5 env sequences may also include a significant number of back mutations and suggests that the evolutionary distances among FIV subtypes are underestimated. Although only a few subtype B viruses were available for examination, the pattern of diversity between the FIV A and B subtypes was found to be significantly distinct; subtype B sequences had proportionally fewer mutations that changed amino acids, compared with silent changes, suggesting a more advanced state of adaptation to the host. No similar distinction was evident for HIV-1 subtypes. The diversity of FIV genomes within individual infected cats was found to be as high as 3.7% yet twofold lower than that within HIV-1-infected people over a comparable region of the env gene. Despite these differences, significant parallels between patterns of FIV evolution and HIV-1 evolution exist, indicating that a wide array of potentially divergent virus challenges need to be considered in FIV vaccine and pathogenesis studies."
5858,0.002,2.0000,"Studies on human genetic variations are a useful source of knowledge about human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. The Langerin protein, found at the surface of Langerhans cells, has an important protective role in HIV-1 infection. Differences in Langerin function due to host genetic factors could influence susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. To verify the frequency of mutations in the Langerin gene, 118 samples from HIV-1-infected women and 99 samples from HIV-1-uninfected individuals were selected for sequencing of the promoter and carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD)-encoding regions of the Langerin gene. Langerin promoter analysis revealed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one mutation in both studied groups, which created new binding sites for certain transcription factors, such as NFAT5, HOXB9.01 and STAT6.01, according to MatInspector software analysis. Three SNPs were observed in the CRD-encoding region in HIV-1-infected and uninfected individuals: p.K313I, c.941C>T and c.983C>T. This study shows that mutations in the Langerin gene are present in the analysed populations at different genotypic and allelic frequencies. Further studies should be conducted to verify the role of these mutations in HIV-1 susceptibility. "
835,0.002,2.0000,"Many hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients are also infected with HIV, and undergo antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Due to changes in HIV burden and immunologic status, HIV ARV treatment may have indirect effects on the HCV population, which could impact the effectiveness of subsequent HCV protease inhibitor (PI) treatment. The genetic variability of the protease-encoding HCV NS3 gene was evaluated in 10 co-infected patients initiating ARVs (both before and after ARV initiation), and compared to the genetic variability in 10 patients on stable ARV therapy. After RT-PCR of plasma-derived HCV RNA, a mean of 20 clones per patient time-point were sequenced and analyzed for changes in the HCV quasispecies population. No significant differences in sequence diversity or complexity at the nucleic acid or amino acid levels were seen at baseline between groups or between the two time points in either group. HCV protease diversity in the pre- and post-ARV treatment samples was not significantly different than samples from patients on stable ARV therapy. There was no significant development of amino acid substitutions known to confer HCV PI resistance in either group. Initiation of ARV for HIV infection does not significantly alter the genetic diversity or complexity of the HCV NS3 gene or result in increased number of HCV PI-associated amino acid changes. These results suggest ARV treatment for HIV would not affect the efficacy of HCV PI treatment."
744,0.002,2.0000,"HIV-infected children are at high risk of acquiring drug-resistant viruses, which is of particular concern in settings where antiretroviral drug options are limited. We aimed to assess resistance patterns and predict viral drug susceptibility among children with first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure in Uganda. A cross-sectional analysis of children switching ART regimens due to first-line failure was performed at three clinical sites in Uganda. HIV-RNA determination and genotypic resistance testing on all specimens with HIV-RNA >1,000 copies/ml were performed. Major drug resistance mutations were scored using the 2011 International Antiviral Society-USA list. The Stanford algorithm was used to predict drug susceptibility. At the time of switch, 44 genotypic resistance tests were available for 50 children. All children harbored virus with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance [95% confidence interval (CI) 92-100%] and NRTI resistance was present in 98% (95% CI 88-100%). Forty-six percent (95% CI 30-61%) of children harbored ≥2 thymidine analog mutations. M184V was identified as the only NRTI mutation in 27% (95% CI 15-43%). HIV susceptibility to NRTIs, with the exception of tenofovir, was reduced in ≥60% of children. Ugandan children experiencing first-line ART failure in our study harbored high rates of dual-class and accumulated HIV drug resistance. Methods to prevent treatment failure, including adequate pediatric formulations and alternative second-line treatment options, are urgently needed."
2553,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes different clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic carriage to fulminant or chronic hepatitis. Serological tests are widely used for the diagnosis of HBV infections to detect viral markers. However, facing with atypical serological profiles in some patients leads to problems in interpreting of the results and management of the patients. The aims of this study were to investigate the atypical serologic profiles seen in patients screened for HBV infection and the S gene mutations in patients with concurrent positivity of HBsAg and anti-HBs. A total of 592 sera from patients (332 male, 260 female; age range: 13-84 years, mean age: 43.9 years) prediagnosed as HBV infection between January to September 2013, and screened for HBV markers (HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HBe, anti-HBc-IgM, anti-HBc-total and HBV-DNA) were included in the study. Of those samples 364 were screened only for HBsAg and anti-HBs markers. S gene mutations were investigated by direct sequencing method in sera which were concurrent positive for HBsAg and anti-HBs. In our study, 5.2% (31/592) of the sera yielded atypical serologic profiles. Of these 13 cases were concurrently positive for HBsAg and anti-HBs; nine were HBeAg positive, anti-HBe and HBV-DNA negative; eight were HBeAg, anti-HBe and HBV-DNA positive; and one was HBsAg and anti-HBs negative, anti-HBe and HBV-DNA positive. The rate of concurrent positivity of HBsAg and anti-HBs was 3.6% (13/364), while 76.9% (10/13) of those cases were also positive for HBV-DNA. DNA sequencing was performed for seven out of 10 samples which were positive for HBsAg, anti-HBs and HBV-DNA, however three samples were not used because of the low amounts. Sequence analysis of seven samples showed S gene mutations in two samples, one was sS143L with sS193L, a HBV vaccine escape mutation, and the other was sP120R, a HBV immune escape mutation. Of the patients 2.7% (10/364) was negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs; in which nine were HBV-DNA negative and anti-HBe positive, while one was positive for both HBV-DNA and anti-HBe. The rate of concurrent positivity of HBeAg and anti-HBe was found as 1.4% (8/592), and all of these samples were HBV-DNA positive. No single positivity for HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs or HBV-DNA was not detected in any of the patients. In conclusion, HBsAg and anti-HBs concurrent positivity was the most frequently detected atypical profile in our study (3.6%), and in some (2/7) of these patients S gene mutations were determined."
3773,0.002,2.0000,"A 49 year-old man was referred to our hospital for fear of developing fulminant hepatic failure. There had been an outbreak of fulminant hepatitis B in a dialysis clinic in the western part of Honshu, Japan, that resulted in four deaths among six patients. After the sixth patient contracted severe hepatitis, all patients in the unit were screened biweekly for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to detect newly infected patients as soon as possible. Our patient was the seventh victim, and on the day he gave a positive result for HBsAg, his hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level had reached 1.1 x 10(11) copies/ml as assessed by real time polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of the causal HBV revealed the presence of a mutation in the precore region (nt 1896), two mutations in the core promoter (nt 1762 and nt 1764), and some minor mutations in the P gene that were restricted to the upstream region. These mutations are indicative of a virus with a high replicative rate that cannot secrete HBeAg. Taken together, these findings indicate that it is very likely that the replicative ability of the causal virus was as vigorous as that of HBV in hepatitis B e antigen-positive asymptomatic carriers with markedly high viral titers. The present case report provides clinical evidence of a possible association between the rapid spread of highly replicative HBV before host immunological recognition and the development of fulminant hepatitis."
6755,0.002,2.0000,"The study aimed to clarify clinical significance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) rtA181S mutation in Chinese HBV-infected patients. A total of 18 419 patients with chronic HBV infection from Beijing 302 Hospital were investigated. HBV complete reverse transcriptase region of polymerase was screened by direct sequencing, and the results were verified by clonal sequencing. Replication-competent mutant and wild-type HBV genomic amplicons were constructed and transfected into the HepG2 cells and cultured in the presence or absence of serially diluted nucleos(t)ide analogues. Intracellular HBV replicative intermediates were quantitated for calculating the 50% effective concentration of the drug (EC(50)). The rtA181S was detected in 98 patients with 12 kinds of mutational patterns. Genotype C and genotype B HBV infection occupied 91.8% and 8.2% in rtA181S-positive patients, in contrast to 84.6% and 15.4% in rtA181S-negative patients (P < 0.01). All rtA181S-positive patients had received nucleos(t)ide analogues. rtA181S was detected in multiple patients with virologic breakthrough. Phenotypic analysis of patient-derived viral strains showed that rtA181S, rtA181S+N236T, rtN236T and rtA181V strains had 68.5%, 49.9%, 71.4% and 66.2% of natural replication capacity of wild-type strain, and 3.7-fold, 9.8-fold, 7.9-fold and 5.6-fold increased EC(50) to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). The rtA181S strain remained susceptible to lamivudine, entecavir and tenofovir, and ADV susceptibility was restored after the mutation was eliminated through site-directed mutagenesis. Rescue therapy with entecavir or combination therapy was effective in rtA181S-related ADV-refractory patients. The rtA181S mutation confers moderate resistance to ADV. It could be induced by either lamivudine or ADV and contribute ADV treatment failure."
6597,0.002,2.0000,"This report describes the neurologic manifestations of 36 children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In this cohort, in 16 of 21 children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), three of 12 children with AIDS-related complex, and one of three asymptomatic seropositive children, a progressive encephalopathy developed. Neurologic signs were often detected early but tended to worsen coincident with progression of the immunodeficiency. The presence of progressive encephalopathy correlated with the absence of serum neutralizing antibodies to HIV and with a poor, usually fatal, outcome. The incubation period from initial HIV infection in the perinatal period to the onset of progressive encephalopathy varied from 2 months to 5 years. Intrablood-brain barrier synthesis of HIV-specific antibodies was demonstrated in eight of 14 children with AIDS and AIDS-related complex, indicating active brain infection with HIV. In three cases this was unassociated with progressive neurologic signs. Unique neuropathologic findings in children who died with HIV infection further suggest that the progressive encephalopathy is the result of primary and persistent infection of the brain with this retrovirus. These findings broaden the spectrum of HIV infection in children and have important implications for the development of antiviral therapy."
7402,0.002,2.0000,"There is risk of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in sexually active couples, one of whom is seropositive. However, the frequency of such HIV transmission is not known. We have surveyed a population of monogamous hemophiliacs treated with potentially-infected coagulation factor concentrates during 1980-1984. We found high titers of antibodies to HIV in 24 of 30 hemophiliacs and in four of 30 spouses. The duration of HIV exposure from unprotected sexual intercourse ranged from greater than 12 to 78 months. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) developed in six hemophiliac husbands, and one seropositive wife has lymphadenopathy. We were concerned that viremia with HIV might be the primary determinant of transmission to the men's wives. Circulating HIV was found in all of four hemophiliacs with AIDS, both of two with AIDS-related complex (ARC), four of 14 asymptomatic hemophiliacs, and two of four seropositive spouses. Isolation of HIV was less likely from asymptomatic hemophiliacs (29%) than from asymptomatic seropositive men (71%) in other high-risk groups. Our studies suggest that HIV was transmitted to 17% of the spouses of hemophiliacs. Efforts to educate all such couples about the risk of HIV infection remain imperative."
1447,0.002,2.0000,"A large percentage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients have serological evidence of a past or present hepatitis B virus infection (HBV). Long-term survival is increasing for HIV patients because of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, the chronic hepatitis B infection may become an important determinant of disease outcome in these co-infected patients. We describe two HIV/HBV co-infected patients who were treated with extended antiviral therapy, initially indicated for the HIV infection. Lamivudine, a suppressor of viral replication in both infections, was one of these antiviral drugs. One patient showed a severe rebound of the HBV after withdrawal of lamivudine, the other patient developed a mutant hepatitis B virus after 18 months of treatment. This mutation was exclusively induced by lamivudine. These patients show that, with improved HIV-related survival, the HBV infection should be monitored carefully, thereby enabling the physician to interfere with therapy when necessary."
5943,0.002,2.0000,"Thirty patients with AIDS-related complex/Walter-Reed 5 enrolled in a placebo-controlled double-blind study with high-dose intravenous gammaglobulin administration were tested by quantitating HIV Western blot and other serological tests for viral antibodies. Furthermore, conventional virus isolation attempts were performed. Absence or loss of p24 antibodies during the study period was associated with progression to AIDS (p = 0.01) and thereby was an earlier prognostic parameter of a poor prognosis than T4 cell count. Neither changes in antibody patterns against other HIV polypeptides, HIV titers in the immunofluorescence test nor demonstration of HIV antigen were significantly associated with progression to AIDS. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) could be isolated from two duodenal biopsies of a patient who developed AIDS at the same time, but a concomitant serological diagnosis of CMV infection was not successful. Though signs in the serology of human herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus, CMV, Epstein-Barr virus), possibly indicating a reactivation of latent infections, could be observed in some instances, a correlation with clinical symptoms or the clinical outcome was not feasible, perhaps also because of a poor standardization of some of the test kits used. All patients were positive for IgG antibodies against the three herpesviruses when entering the study. High prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers was found (83% anti-HBc positive), only 1 patient being chronically infected and highly infectious, as shown by HBV-DNA hybridization. No significant difference between treatment and placebo group was observed with the parameters tested in this study."
1551,0.002,2.0000,"This exploratory analyses characterizes patterns of lymphocyte recovery in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and investigates their relationship with baseline indices and virologic responses. We modeled kinetics of total CD4+ lymphocytes, as well as naive (CD45RA+ CD62L+), and memory (CD45RA- CD45RO+) subsets in 48 patients treated with AZT/3TC/Ritonavir for 48 weeks in ACTG protocol 315. Cell kinetic indices were estimated by nonlinear regression methods and were correlated with baseline factors and virologic responses. Five different kinetic patterns were identified, including biphasic growth, growth-plateau, growth-depletion, decay-recovery, and biphasic decay. Although overall mean lymphocyte responses showed a biphasic increase in cell number, a careful investigation reveals that only one-third of patients actually followed the biphasic growth pattern in CD4+ cell response, while 44% of 48 patients from this study followed the growth-depletion pattern. CD4+ cell recovery during the first phase and the 48-week study period were negatively correlated with baseline CD4+ cell counts, and positively correlated with baseline viral load. Memory CD4+ cell recovery during the first phase was also negatively correlated with baseline memory CD4+ and total CD4+ cell number, but the recovery rate of memory CD4+ cells during the second phase was positively correlated with baseline CD4+ cell number. Patients with a decay in CD4+ cell count during treatment were more likely to have experienced virological rebound (58%) than patients with nondecay patterns (24%). The rate and magnitude of the absolute increase in total CD4+ and memory CD4+ cell number (but not naive CD4+ cells) during the second phase were lower in patients with viral rebound compared with patients with persistent viral suppression. These results show that the kinetics of lymphocyte reconstitution in response to potent antiretroviral therapy in individual patients vary considerably from the ""classic"" biphasic increase that characterizes the mean or median response pattern. Pattern analysis of lymphocyte kinetics may be useful for testing relationships among factors that modulate the response to treatment."
9151,0.002,2.0000,"The neutralizing Ab response after primary HIV-1 infection is delayed relative to the virus-specific CD8(+) T cell response and the initial decline in plasma viremia. Because nearly all HIV-1 infections result in AIDS, it would be instructive to study cases where neutralizing Ab production commenced sooner. This was done in subject AC10, an individual treated during early infection and in whom a rapid autologous neutralizing Ab response was detected after therapy cessation as rebound viremia declined and remained below 1000 RNA copies/ml of blood for over 2.5 years. This subject's Abs were capable of reducing the infectivity of his rebound virus by >4 logs in vitro at a time when rebound viremia was down-regulated and virus-specific CD8(+) T cells were minimal, suggesting that neutralizing Abs played an important role in the early control of viremia. The rebound virus did not exhibit an unusual phenotype that might explain its high sensitivity to neutralization by autologous sera. Neutralization escape occurred within 75 days and was proceeded by neutralizing Ab production to the escape variant and subsequent escape. Notably, escape was not associated with a significant rise in plasma viremia, perhaps due to increasing CD8(+) T cell responses. Sequence analysis of gp160 revealed a growing number of mutations over time, suggesting ongoing viral evolution in the face of potent antiviral immune responses. We postulate that an early effective neutralizing Ab response can provide long-term clinical benefits despite neutralization escape."
7873,0.002,2.0000,"Severe hepatotoxicity is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect of antiretroviral therapy. In this case report we describe an HIV-positive patient who was admitted to our clinic with evidence of severe acute pancreatitis 18 months after the introduction of antiretroviral treatment, which included stavudine and didanosine. Shortly afterwards, she developed lactate acidosis and acute hepatic failure associated with renal failure. Renal support (hemofiltration) was required for three days. The patient subsequently developed grade III encephalopathy, as well as a large pleural effusion and ascites. Although the reported outcome of patients with liver failure due to antiretroviral treatment is poor, with a high mortality rate, our patient fully recovered after intensive supportive care and cessation of the antiretroviral agents. Liver biopsy revealed microvesicular steatosis and giant mitochondria, which are the typical hallmarks of mitochondrial damage, the presumed mechanism of antiretroviral drug toxicity. More than three years later the patient has an excellent clinical status with a stable HIV infection and no need for antiretroviral treatment. This case report indicates the need for increased awareness of the potential hepatotoxicity of an antiretroviral therapy, as severe side effects may occur more frequently with increasing use of such treatment."
2731,0.002,2.0000,"It is still unclear whether hepatitis G virus (HGV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection influences the natural course of chronic HCV infection and the response to interferon (IFN) therapy. In this study, we investigated the HGV RNA changes and responses to IFN therapy of HGV RNA-positive hepatitis C patients. The presence of HGV RNA in 264 patients who received IFN therapy at our institute was examined using the nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with primers deduced from the 5' non-coding region (5'-NCR) of the HGV. We also analysed the nucleotide sequences of the 5'-NCR and HGV before and after IFN therapy. Twelve (4.5%) of the 264 patients with chronic hepatitis C were HGV RNA positive. Of these 12 patients, full information was available in nine. Of those nine, seven became HGV RNA negative during IFN therapy but in six of the seven a relapse occurred. HCV RNA was not detected 1 year after IFN therapy in six patients. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of all the HCV RNA-negative patients post-treatment was within the normal range, irrespective of their HGV RNA status. Nucleotide sequences did not change after IFN therapy in any patient. Hence, we confirm that HGV is sensitive to IFN therapy but the liver damage caused by HGV infection is very mild or does not modify the liver function tests."
4247,0.002,2.0000,"Studies on the effects of alcohol use on HIV disease progression have been contradictory, with at least one study finding a positive effect of low alcohol consumption on CD4 count. In addition, most such studies have taken place in the developed West. We investigated the association between alcohol use and immune reconstitution through CD4 count response among HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at an urban sub-Saharan African clinic. This was a retrospective cohort study of treatment-naïve HIV-infected adults initiating ART in Nairobi, Kenya and followed for 12 months between January 2009 and December 2012. At enrollment, a standardized questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic variables and alcohol consumption. CD4 count was measured every six months. Linear regression models assessed the association between CD4 count and alcohol consumption, categorized as abstinent, moderate, or hazardous. Overall, 854 participants were included, 522 of which were women, with 85 (25.6%) men and 50 (9.6%) women reporting any alcohol use, and 8 (2.4%) men and 7 (1.3%) women reporting hazardous drinking. At baseline, alcohol use was associated with higher education and socioeconomic status. Median CD4 count was higher among alcohol users compared to those who abstained at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post-ART initiation, although this was only significant at 6 months. There were no differences in adherence between abstainers and drinkers. While overall alcohol use was significantly associated with higher CD4 counts, moderate and hazardous use treated separately were not. We conclude that, while alcohol use was associated with higher CD4 counts at 12 months post-ART, the mechanism for this association is unclear but may reflect unmeasured socioeconomic or nutritional differences. Additional research is required on the specific drinking patterns of this population and the types of alcoholic beverages consumed to clarify this relationship."
8738,0.002,2.0000,"The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of infections with hepatotrophic viruses in an anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive population from Buenos Aires and to compare it among the main risk groups for HIV infection. Four hundred and eighty-four consecutive patients attending the HIV outpatients clinic were studied: 359 men and 125 women, median age 29 years (range 16-67 years); 35.5% had presented acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining conditions. Two hundred and thirty-four patients were intravenous drug users (IVDU), 99 had homosexual and 142 heterosexual preference, seven had received blood transfusions and two had no risk factors. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb) and to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) were investigated in all patients; antibodies to HBsAg (HBsAb) and IgG antibodies to hepatitis D virus (anti-HDV) in all HBcAb-positive patients; hepatitis B e antigen and antibodies to HBeAg (HBeAg) in all HBsAg-positive patients; IgG antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) in the first 307 patients; and IgG antibodies to hepatitis E virus (anti-HEV) in the first 91 patients. As control groups, contemporary voluntary blood donors were studied for prevalence of HAV, HBV, HCV and HEV. The percentages of HBcAb, HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HEV (58.5, 14.5, 58.5 and 6.6%, respectively) were significantly higher in anti-HIV-positive patients than in control groups (3.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.8%, respectively) (P = 0.000). The prevalence of HBcAb was significantly higher in IVDU (72.6%) than in heterosexuals (33.8%) (P = 0.0001) and in homosexuals (59.6%) (P = 0.0189). The percentage of HBsAg was significantly higher in IVDU (19.2%) than in heterosexuals (6.3%) (P = 0.0004). Anti-HCV was significantly higher in IVDU (92.3%) than in homosexuals (14.1%) and in heterosexuals (33.1%) (P = 0.000 in both cases). The prevalence of anti-HDV was relatively low (1.9%). There was no difference in the percentage of anti-HAV between HIV-positive and negative subjects. In conclusion, there is a high prevalence of HBV and HCV infections in HIV-positive patients from our area. Drug use is the main route of transmission, but prevalence of HCV in patients with, probably, sexually acquired HIV infection is also higher than in the control group. The increased prevalence of HEV infection in HIV-positive individuals is another provocative finding that warrants further study."
1983,0.002,2.0000,"In Poland, as in many other countries, HIV infection is often detected at a late stage. We conducted this study to determine if Polish medical students possess adequate HIV/AIDS knowledge and diagnostic skills needed to improve HIV detection and care in Poland. Between 2004 and 2006, sixth-year (senior) medical students at the Medical University of Bialystok were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire with questions about HIV transmission route and clinical characteristics. Although more than 50% of student respondents estimated their knowledge of HIV/AIDS as good or very good, HIV/AIDS knowledge assessment results did not support this self-reported level of proficiency. More than 40% of students answered that there are no symptoms associated with HIV infection that would make primary care physicians suspect the diagnosis. A significant majority of students could not name AIDS indicator diseases. To improve public health and quality of care for persons infected with HIV, it is necessary to better educate physicians-in-training about the clinical characteristics and transmission routes for HIV/AIDS, as well as approaches to discuss human sexuality and sexually transmitted infection prevention with patients."

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and occult HBV (presence of HBV-DNA in the absence of HBsAg) in a rural, South African cohort. The results were compared to various ethnic groups in a Dutch cohort of people infected with HIV. Antiretroviral-naïve individuals with HIV from both a rural South African clinic (n = 258), and a Dutch University hospital (n = 782), were included. Both serological (HBV and HCV) and molecular (occult HBV) assays were performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to define independent predictors of a hepatitis co-infection. HBV and HCV prevalence rates in the South African cohort were exceptionally low (0.4%, 1/242 and 0.8%, 2/242, respectively), compared to those observed in Caucasians (HBV 4.4% and HCV 10.9%) and African immigrants (HBV 8.9% and HCV 4.8%). Conversely, occult HBV was observed in a considerable proportion (10%, 6/60) of South African patients who were anti-HBc-positive but HBsAg-negative. Occult infections were less frequent in Caucasians and Africans in the Dutch cohort (3.2% and 1.4%, respectively). Independent predictors for occult HBV were not identified, but a trend towards more occult HBV at lower CD4 counts was observed. Local HBV/HCV prevalence data are needed to optimize vaccination and antiretroviral treatment strategies. Occult HBV in patients with HIV may be missed regularly when molecular analyses are not available."
7386,0.002,2.0000,"We report a case of simultaneous infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in a 26-year-old Japanese homosexual man. He was admitted to our hospital for acute hepatitis caused by HBV. At that time, HIV-1antibody (Ab) was not detected in his serum. After 6 months, he was readmitted to our hospital for further examination of his liver because of confined liver enzyme abnormalities. Anti-HIV- Ab was detected in his serum by both enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) and particle agglutination (PA). His serum HIV-1 RNA level was 50 x 10(4) copies/ml and serum levels of HBV DNA polymerase (DNA-P) and HBV DNA were 6535cpm and 3 plus (>1000 copies/ml). His clinical course and laboratory data suggested progression from acute to chronic hepatitis related to coinfection with HIV-1. The diagnosis was chronic active hepatitis caused by HBV as an opportunistic infection due to coinfection with HIV-1. We began highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) because interferon (IFN) therapy was ineffective. HAART was started at an initial dosage of 600 mg zidovudine (AZT), 300 mg lamivudine (3TC), and 2400 mg indinavir (IDV) daily. After 4 weeks, the serum level of HBV DNA-polymerase (p) had decreased markedly to 37cpm and that of HIV-1 RNA had decreased to below the sensitivity threshold, indicating considerable suppression of the replication of these viruses by the treatment. But HBV DNA remained at low levels. Although the incidence of HBV infection in patients with HIV-1 infection has been reported to be high in the United States and Europe, simultaneous HBV and HIV-1 infection leading to persistent HBV infection is rare."
4079,0.002,2.0000,"There are 3 groups of drugs available for the treatment of patients with HIV disease. These are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ('nucleoside analogues') [zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, lamivudine and abacavir]; the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz); and the protease inhibitors (saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and amprenavir). The preferred initial regimen should reduce and maintain plasma HIV RNA below the level of detection. Presently, the regimen of choice consists of 2 nucleoside analogues plus a protease inhibitor with high in vivo efficacy. An alternative combination consists of 2 nucleoside analogues plus a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Drug interactions are one of the major problems associated with these multidrug regimens. Changes in plasma concentrations of the nucleoside analogues are unlikely to be of clinical relevance as drug effect is mainly dependent on the rate and extent of intracellular phosphorylation. Combinations of zidovudine plus stavudine, and probably zalcitabine plus lamivudine, should be avoided as competition for phosphorylating enzymes may occur. The antiviral efficacy of some nucleoside analogues, e.g. stavudine, may be compromised by prior treatment with other nucleosides (e.g. zidovudine). However, these data need to be clarified in further studies. It is unlikely that administration of other antiretrovirals will influence the activity of nucleoside analogues. Protease inhibitors are metabolised by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Combination protease inhibitor therapy can result in drug interactions mediated by enzyme inhibition. Ritonavir is the most potent inhibitor, saquinavir the least. The protease inhibitors also interact with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Nevirapine and efavirenz induce drug metabolising enzymes and may reduce plasma concentrations of protease inhibitors. A study in healthy volunteers showed that nelfinavir concentrations are increased by combination with efavirenz. Delavirdine inhibits drug metabolising enzymes and increases the plasma concentration of coadministered protease inhibitors. The nucleoside analogues would not be expected to interact with the protease inhibitors. Apart from the ability of didanosine to reduce the area under the concentration-time curve of delavirdine, there are no reports of clinically significant interactions of other antiretrovirals with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Triple therapy is the current standard of care for patients with HIV disease. However, studies of quadruple therapy are already under way. Drug interactions are likely to remain one of the major considerations when selecting a therapeutic regimen for patients with HIV."
5917,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients who undergo organ transplantation is a serious illness, associated with progressive and often fatal liver disease. Attempts at eradication of infection with antiviral agents, such as interferon and adenine arabinoside, have produced disappointing results. Similarly, prevention of HBV reinfection with the use of passive immunization with hepatitis B immunoglobulin or a combination of active and passive immunization have not been uniformly successful. We report the successful use of ganciclovir, a synthetic analogue of 2-deoxyguanosine, in a heart transplant patient with active HBV infection. The patient developed decompensated liver disease with ascites, edema, and marked derangement of liver tests despite drastic reduction in immunosuppressive therapy. Ganciclovir therapy was administered intravenously, and the patient showed remarkable improvement with clinical recovery and normalization of the liver tests. Moreover, the serum HBV DNA and hepatitis B e antigen became undetectable. Ganciclovir was a safe and effective treatment of HBV infection in this transplant patient."
4178,0.002,2.0000,"It has been speculated that hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicates in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which, therefore, may be a site for interaction with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We used strand-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect HCV RNA in 28 HCV-monoinfected and 20 HIV/HCV-coinfected women. At the first visit, positive-strand HCV RNA was detected in serum samples from 89% of the women, whereas positive-strand HCV RNA was detected in PBMC samples from 32% and 55% of the HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected women, respectively. After initiation of antiretroviral therapy, the HIV/HCV-coinfected women were significantly more likely to have detectable positive- and negative-strand HCV RNA in the PBMC compartment than were the HCV-monoinfected women. HIV and HCV RNA levels were not correlated. Serum HCV RNA levels were correlated over time; HCV RNA levels in the serum and PBMC compartments were not. These data suggest differential regulation of HCV RNA in the serum and PBMC compartments and may partially explain the limited HCV antiviral response rates observed in coinfected persons."
4225,0.002,2.0000,"Signaling through interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) is essential for regulation of T-cell homeostasis and survival. Previously, we and others have found diminished IL-7R levels in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) - infected non-human primates and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - infected patients. To date, it remains unknown whether changes in IL-7R expression could also be linked to non-infectious inflammatory diseases such as asthma or anti-inflammatory drug use. Here, we investigated through flow cytometry the levels of IL-7R expression on CD4+ and CD4- T-cells in asthmatic patients in relation to disease severity, immune status and glucocorticoid (GC) use. In addition, we sought to evaluate the effects of in vivo and in vitro GC treatment on IL-7R expression in both asthmatic patients and SIV-infected non-human primates. We demonstrated that expression of IL-7R on peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells was significantly decreased in clinically stable GC-naive mild and moderate asthmatic patients. Accordingly, the development of asthmatic reaction following bronchial allergen challenge performed in sensitized subjects was associated with a significant drop in levels of IL-7R on circulating CD4+ T-cells. In contrast, CD4+ T-cells from both, mild and moderate, but not severe asthmatics, treated with inhaled GC displayed levels of IL-7R similar to that seen in healthy controls. We did not find significant differences with serum or sputum interleukin-7 levels among healthy controls and GC-naïve and GC-treated asthmatic patients. Furthermore, both in vitro GC treatment and short-term oral GC administration to asthmatic patients resulted in a significant enhancement of IL-7R. Similarly, we demonstrated that GC-stimulated T-cells from SIV-infected non-human primates up-regulated IL-7R expression. Accordingly, experimental short-term systemic in vivo administration of GC to SIV-infected macaques led to enhancement of IL-7R expression on circulating T-cells. Our data indicate that GC bear potential to recover diminished IL-7R expression, as well in asthma as in lentiviral infection. "
7114,0.002,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a major healthcare concern. The 24-48 week treatment of pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy requires a tremendous amount of commitment from patients and providers. Thus, there has been a huge focus on health-related quality of life and various measures to support patient adherence and completion of the recommended HCV treatment regimen. This quality improvement project aimed to develop and test a nurse-driven evidence-based pathway that supports the care of patients receiving hepatitis C medication therapy in a tertiary, academic hepatology practice. All adult patients, 18 years and older, who were started on HCV treatment from January 20 to February 15, 2011, were included in the testing of a nurse-driven HCV pathway for the first 12 weeks of treatment. The majority of the patients treated were male (71.8% prepathway and 83.3% postpathway), of White ethnic background (61.5% prepathway and 58.3% postpathway), genotype 1 (69% prepathway and 91.7% postpathway), and had comorbid conditions classified as ""other"" (38.5% prepathway and 33.3% postpathway). As for treatment status, the majority of the patients were ""treatment naive"" in prepathway or had never received prior HCV treatment (59.0%) or ""had recurrent HCV after liver transplantation"" (41.7%). The 4-week treatment completion rate was 94.9% for the prepathway group and 100.0% for the postpathway group; 12-week completion rate was 87.2% (prepathway) and 58.3% for the postpathway group. The mean 4-week adherence score for the prepathway group was 2.46 and the postpathway group was 2.92. Mean lag time to treatment was decreased with 26 days in the postpathway and 43 in the prepathway. Providers and nurses expressed overall satisfaction with the nurse-driven pathway. "
9239,0.002,2.0000,"The prevalence of hepatitis virus markers in patients with chronic liver diseases from two countries has been studied: 68 patients (38 alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis, 30 chronic HBsAg-positive hepatitis) from Hungary as well as 109 patients (55 alcoholic liver disease, 45 chronic hepatitis or cryptogenic cirrhosis and 9 hepatoma) from Romania were examined for HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HCV and anti-HDV, using the corresponding Abbott Elisa test systems. In alcoholic liver disease HBsAg occurred in 6/38 patients from Hungary and in 22/55 patients respectively, that is HBV markers occurred with significantly higher frequency in alcoholic patients from Romania (p less than 0.05). In the Hungarian group a total of 36 patients were HBsAg positive and out of them 5 had anti-HDV (13.9%), while out of 21 Romania HBsAg carriers 10 patients had anti-HDV (47.6%). Among 9 hepatoma patients 4 had HBsAg, 6 anti-HBs and 7 anti-HBc and 4 had anti-HCV and 3 had anti-HDV. One patient with hepatoma had both HBsAg and anti-HCV plus anti-HDV as well. Results suggest that the infection with hepatitis viruses in alcoholic liver diseases is more common in Romania than in Hungary, and the prevalence of delta virus infection in HBV carriers is also significantly higher in Romania than in Hungary."
1355,0.002,2.0000,"Non-adherence is one of the major causes of treatment failure which leads to increased morbidity and mortality caused by opportunistic infections. Optimal anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence is essential for maximal suppression of viral replication and long term survival of patients. In order to develop effective public health interventions in the context of scaling ART services to peripheral areas, it is important to evaluate factors associated with non-adherence among HIV-infected individuals in Pwani Region. The purpose of this study was to identify factors related to non-adherence to ART among HIV infected people in Pwani Region eastern of Tanzania. A case-control study was carried out at Tumbi Hospital and Chalinze Health Centre in Pwani Region in eastern Tanzania. A structured questionnaire was used to assess non-adherence and adherence to doses instruction and time schedule. Patients with less than 95% adherence were defined as cases while those with more than 95% adherence became controls. A structured questionnaire containing factors known to be associated with non-adherence to ART in similar settings was administered. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with non-adherence. A total of 79 cases and 237 controls matched by age and sex were studied. A high proportion of cases and controls (77.2% and 84.8%) had good knowledge ofART benefits, adherence and eligibility. Majority of cases (73.3%) and controls (69.2%) used public transport to access ART services. More than half of cases (53.2%) missed clinic appointments due to lack of bus fare or other reasons and was associated with ART non adherence (mOR 4.2, 95%CI, 2.2-8.1 and 2.1,95%CI 1.2-4.2). Disclosure to confidants only and failure to disclose HIV-test positive status were associated with non adherence (mOR 3.3, 95%CI 1.3-8.5 and 2.3, 95%CI 1.2-7.1). Alcohol use was associated with non adherence to ART (mOR 1.9, 95%CI 1.4-3.7). Patients who were not satisfied with providers were more likely to be non adherence to ART (mOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.2-3.8). In conclusion, these findings show that adherence is a process which is depended on local specific adherence factors. Adherence improvement strategies need to consider site specific adherence determinants, patient experiences and concerns."
9648,0.002,2.0000,"Cigarette smoking among people living with HIV/AIDS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but findings regarding the association between cigarette smoking and HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts have been inconsistent. This study characterized the prevalence of cigarette smoking among HIV-infected Russian women and examined the association between smoking frequency and quantity and HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. HIV-infected Russian women (N = 250; M age = 30.0) in St. Petersburg, Russia, completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview survey assessing cigarette use, antiretroviral medication adherence, and provided blood samples assayed for HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. The majority (60.4%) reported cigarette smoking in the past month; 49.0% of recent smokers were classified as moderate or heavy smokers, defined as smoking ≥10 cigarettes daily. Viral load status did not differ between infrequent smokers and regular smokers. However, moderate/heavy smokers (relative to light smokers) were more likely to have a detectable viral load (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.1). There were no significant differences in CD4+ lymphocyte counts by smoking frequency or quantity of cigarettes smoked. Results highlight the need for additional research to examine the association between cigarette smoking and virologic suppression and markers of HIV disease progression. Adverse health consequences of cigarette smoking coupled with a potential link between heavy smoking and poor virologic suppression highlight the need for assessment of cigarette use and provision of evidence-based smoking-cessation interventions within HIV medical care."
76,0.002,2.0000,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between ancillary services, including case management, and clinical and behavioral outcomes for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women. Data were obtained from databases systematically maintained by Family Advocacy, Care and Education Services (FACES) and the HIV Outpatient Program (HOP) in New Orleans. HIV-infected women receiving primary care from HOP and ancillary services from FACES between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 1998 were eligible. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with STATA software. The majority of women included in the study were African American (86.7%), infected heterosexually (78.8%), and had absolute CD4 counts greater than 200 (58.6%). After adjusting for age, time, entry time into HOP, pregnancy, CD4 count, substance abuse status, and social and clinical stressors, receipt of more than four combined case manager contacts or ancillary services per month was significantly associated with being prescribed a protease inhibitor, improved adherence and retention in primary care, and enrolling on a research protocol. Receiving more than one transportation service per month was significantly associated with improved adherence, improved retention, one or more emergency room visits per month, and one or more hospitalizations per month. Receiving more than one contact with case managers per month was associated with improved retention in primary care. Findings suggest that receipt of case management and ancillary services is associated with improvements in multiple outcomes for HIV-infected women. A client-centered approach to providing ancillary services appears to be effective in improving behavioral and utilization characteristics in this population of low-income, high-risk women."
6681,0.002,2.0000,"It is still controversial whether viral hepatitis co-infection can influence antiretroviral plasma drug concentrations and whether drug concentrations are correlated with liver enzyme elevations during highly active antiretroviral therapy. An analysis of data from a cohort of 220 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients was conducted. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were performed to identify predictors of plasma drug concentrations. The association of transaminase elevation with higher plasma drug concentrations was explored following stratification of patients into HIV monoinfected and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infected groups. Hepatitis co-infections were independently correlated with drug concentrations above the therapeutic cut-offs at Week 1 (P=0.06), Week 4 (P=0.04) and Week 12 (P=0.005). The apparent effect was independent of the possible impact exerted by other variables such as demographics and medication adherence. The incidence of relevant hypertransaminasaemia was low. Patients with hepatitis co-infections had higher rates of transaminase elevation than monoinfected HIV patients; however, risk of transaminase elevation was not associated with drug concentrations. The presence of HCV and/or HBV co-infections correlated with higher plasma drug concentrations, although it did not appear to influence hepatotoxicity risk."
9116,0.002,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma. In the United States, HBV infection is commonly associated with high-risk behaviors such as intravenous drug use or unprotected sex; but it is not as well-known among health care providers that HBV can be transmitted from mother to baby during birth. Worldwide, the majority of cases of chronic HBV infection are in people who contracted the virus during birth. There is a lack of awareness in the United States that immigrants from HBV-endemic countries may be at high risk for chronic HBV. Thus, at-risk individuals may not be screened for HBV. The most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend HBV screening for all people born in Asia, all U.S.-born persons who were unvaccinated as infants and whose parents were born in regions of high HBV endemicity (> or = 8%), and individuals with parenteral risk factors. Screening for HBV starts with HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), HBsAb (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen), and total anti-HBc (total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen) testing. For those who are HBV-negative (HBsAg-negative) and have no evidence of prior immunity, the three-part HBV vaccination series is recommended."
2172,0.002,2.0000,"Perinatal transmission is the most common mode of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission and is a leading cause of chronic infection worldwide. Maternal treatment with lamivudine (LAM) can result in a rapid and significant reduction in HBV viral load (VL) and, thus, mitigate the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the safety of LAM treatment administered in the third trimester of pregnancy and determine the influence, if any, on infant outcome. The medical charts of all HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive women eligible for treatment with LAM and who registered for antenatal care between 2007 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. During the 6-year period, 45 women met the criteria for LAM treatment. Thirty-six women (80 %) accepted treatment; the remaining women declined treatment (5), defaulted from care (3) or transferred to another maternity unit (1). The median duration of treatment was 11.4 weeks (range 5.3-17.4) and the median baseline VL was 1.4 × 10(8) IU/mL (range 1.8 × 10(7)-1.7 × 10(8)). The median VL at delivery was 2.3 × 10(5) IU/mL and 60 % of women achieved a VL reduction >2 log10 IU/mL before delivery. No cases of perinatal transmission occurred in the infants born to mothers who received treatment; however, one infant, born to a mother who defaulted from care, was HBV-infected at 8 months. The results suggest that LAM therapy in highly viraemic HBV-infected pregnant women could lower the rate of vertical transmission. "
411,0.002,2.0000,"Efficacy and safety of recombinant yeast-derived hepatitis B vaccines for prevention of hepatitis B have been demonstrated unequivocally worldwide as reflected in reduction in HBsAg carrier rates and hepatocellular carcinoma. A new generation of recombinant HBV vaccines expressed in mammalian cells containing Pre-S/S epitopes has been developed in several countries. Such vaccines are useful in special risk groups, i.e., in non-responders to conventional HBV vaccines including older adults, obese people, health care workers, patients with renal failure and on dialysis, transplant patients, patients with HIV as well as travelers on short notice to HBV endemic regions. The future of such vaccines depends on their enhanced immunogenicity and cost profile. Sci-B-Vac™ is a mammalian cell-derived recombinant Pre-S1/Pre-S2/S hepatitis B vaccine which has been shown to be highly immunogenic, inducing faster and higher seroprotection rates against HBV with higher anti-HBs levels at lower HBsAg doses as compared to conventional yeast-derived vaccines. Recently, it has been suggested that such Pre-S/S vaccines against HBV might be efficacious not only for prevention but also for intervention in persistent HBV infection. Data obtained in a recent clinical trial conducted in Vietnam in patients with chronic hepatitis B suggest that repeated monthly i.m. injections of the Sci-B-Vac™ co-administered with daily oral lamivudine treatment can suppress HBV replication and lead to anti-HBs seroconversion in ~50 % of treated patients. Optimization of protocols and efficacy of such an intervention, intended to bypass T cell exhaustion and immune tolerance to HBV remains to be explored."
3076,0.002,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) and renal transplant recipients. Lamivudine (3TC) has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of HBV replication. It appears to be safe and effective in patients with CRF, though experience is still limited. We describe 4 patients with CRF on hemodialysis who showed a rapid and full response to 3TC, administered for a median of 10 months. All patients had serum alanine transferase (ALT) levels 3 to 6 times the upper limit of normal prior to treatment, and different degrees of histologic inflammatory activity (Knodell score 4 to 8, median 6). All were serum HBsAg- and HBeAg-positive, with serum HBV DNA 1-3.9 x 107 copies/mL (median 1 x 107 copies/mL). Within 4 to 8 weeks of initiation of therapy, HBV DNA became undetectable and serum ALT normalized. Serum HBeAg disappeared in all 4 patients, with the emergence of anti-HBeAb in 3 of them. Three patients also lost HBsAg with the evolution of a protective anti-HBsAb titer. One patient has already undergone successful kidney transplantation with no evidence of HBV recurrence (serum HBV DNA negative) 16 months postoperatively. Although our study sample is small, these data suggest that 3TC can induce a complete biochemical, virological and serological response in patients with CRF and HBV infection. Its use may enable safe kidney transplantation in selected patients."
7755,0.002,2.0000,"Mortality in HIV-positive persons is increasingly due to non-HIV-related medical comorbidities. There are limited data on the prevalence and patient awareness of these comorbid conditions. Two hundred subjects at an urban HIV clinic were interviewed in 2005 to assess their awareness of 15 non-HIV-related medical comorbidities, defined as medical problems that are neither AIDS-defining by standard definitions, nor a direct effect of immune deficiency. Medical charts were subsequently reviewed to establish prevalence and concordance between self-report and chart documentation. Eighty-four percent of subjects self-reported at least 1 of 15 medical comorbidities and 92% had at least 1 condition chart-documented. The top 5 chart-documented conditions were hepatitis C (51.5%), pulmonary disease (28.5%), high blood pressure (27%), high cholesterol (24.5%), and obesity (22.5%). In multivariate analysis, higher number of non-HIV-related medical comorbidities was associated with older age, female gender, and intravenous drug use as route of HIV transmission. Across self-reported non-HIV-related medical comorbidities, the absolute concordance rate ranged from 67% to 96%, the sensitivity ranged from 0% to 79%; the positive predictive value ranged from 0% to 100%. While the vast majority of largely urban minority HIV-positive subjects were diagnosed with non-HIV-related medical comorbidities, there is significant room for improvement in patient awareness. In order to help patients optimally access and adhere to medication and medical care for these non-HIV-related medical comorbidities, interventions and educational campaigns to improve patient awareness that take cultural background, literacy, and educational level into account should be developed, implemented, and evaluated."
7979,0.002,2.0000,"The significance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes for the heterogeneity of chronic HBV infection and severity of liver disease is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and virologic characteristics of HBV genotypes in China and possible association with the diversity of liver disease. The study includes 1096 chronic HBV carriers from nine provinces in China. We collected clinical and laboratory data and analysed the HBV strains in sera by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and nucleotide sequencing techniques. The most common HBV genotypes were B (41%) and C (53%), while genotypes A and D were also found. A North-South divide was identified in genotype B and C distribution - genotype C was predominant in northern China, while genotype B was more prevalent in southern provinces. Patients with genotype B were younger than those with genotype C, and had a lower prevalence of HBeAg - 65%vs 72%, respectively (P = 0.03). However, the severity of liver disease did not differ significantly between patients infected with genotype B or C - neither when comparing liver function tests (1024 patients), nor hepatic inflammation and fibrosis (264 patients). Amongst 47 patients with genotype D (by PCR-RFLP), 37 (79%) were infected with a new subtype (designated Dc), having a recombination fragment from genotype C precore/core region. This is the first large-scale HBV genotype study from China and convincing documentation of the North-to-South gradient of genotypes C vs B in this country. HBV DNA recombination over the surface and precore/core genes increases the diversity of HBV strains and may have diagnostic and clinical implications."
2336,0.002,2.0000,"Recently, hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and mutations have been reported to be related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This cross-sectional case-control study examined the relationship between HCC and mutations in the enhancer II/core promoter and precore regions of HBV by comparing 135 Korean HCC patients infected with HBV genotype C2 (HBV/C2; HCC group) with 135 age-, sex-, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status-matched patients without HCC (non- HCC group). Age and sex were also matched between HBeAg-positive and -negative patients. The prevalence of T1653, A1689, V1753, T1762/A1764, T1846, A1850, C1858, and A1896 mutations was evaluated in this population. The prevalence of the T1653 mutation in the box alpha region, the T1689 [corrected] mutation in between the box alpha and beta regions, and the T1762/A1764 mutations in the basal core promoter region was significantly higher in the HCC group compared to the non-HCC group (8.9% vs. 2.2%, P = 0.017; 19.3% vs. 4.4%, P < 0.001; and 60.7% vs. 22.2%; P < 0.001). Among HBeAg-negative patients, the frequency of the T1653 mutation was higher in the HCC group. Regardless of HBeAg status, the prevalence of the T1689, [corrected] and T1762/A1764 mutations was higher in the HCC group than in the non-HCC group. However, no association was observed between mutations in the precore region and HCC. Upon multivariate analysis, the presence of the T1653, T1689, [corrected] and T1762/A1764 mutations was an independent predictive factor for HCC. The addition of the T1653 or T1689 [corrected] mutation to T1762/A1764 increased the risk of HCC. In conclusion, the T1653, T1689, [corrected] and/or T1762/A1764 mutations were associated with the development of HCC in Korean patients infected with HBV/C2."

Malnutrition represents another cause of acquired immunodeficiency and premature death. This evaluation program estimated the impact of family nutritional support during the first year of antiretroviral treatment in West Africa's sub-Sahara region. Family nutritional support was proposed to patients with CD-4 cell count <200 /mm3 and/or developing a WHO stage III/IV or with body mass index <18.5 kg/m2 and receiving antiretroviral treatment. Follow-up of 62 patients receiving support was compared to 118 patients who had only received antiretroviral treatment the year before. Average body mass index, CD-4 cell count were 20.7 and 20.5, 217 and 191/mm3 respectively in supported and control groups (NS). Twenty-two (36%) and 56 (48%) were WHO stage III/IV (NS) respectively in supported and control groups. One patient who received support and twelve controls died (Mortality Ratio=0.19; p<0.05). Increase in CD-4 cell count was around 1.7 times higher (+ 114 vs. + 68 CD-4 cells/mm3 respectively in supported and control groups; p<0.05) and observance was improved in supported group (p<0.005). The evolutions of WHO stage and body mass index were not different but the study period was short. Family nutritional support for persons living with HIV initiating antiretroviral treatment in a developing country showed a positive impact after six months. This family intervention could be integrated into AIDS interventions as an effective and comprehensive community-based primary care."
4394,0.002,2.0000,"Serological detection of isolated anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) can occur in various scenarios, but the most clinically relevant situation is occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical relevance of isolated anti-HBc and of OBI with isolated anti-HBc from an unselected hospital population. A total of 14,253 patients referred for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)/anti-HBs testing were classified into either the Health Promotion Center (HPC) group or the patient group. For patients who were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, an anti-HBc test was additionally performed. An HBV DNA real-time PCR test was performed on isolated anti-HBc patients, and their demographic and clinical data were reviewed. The measured prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and OBI in isolated anti-HBc patients was 5.9 % and 4.7 %, respectively. Prevalence was higher in males, elderly people, and the patient group than in females, the younger, and the HPC group, respectively. In most cases, the levels of HBV DNA load were very low (less than 200 IU/mL), and most cases of OBI presented without liver disease or history of HBV infection. The prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and OBI are affected by the methods of detection, subject population, and constituent factors such as sex and age. Although detection of HBV DNA does not always indicate infectivity, highly sensitive standardized HBV DNA tests are needed in clinical settings to exclude the possibility of OBI, especially in the advanced age group."
8101,0.002,2.0000,"We performed a quantitative study of serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, including new parameters such as pre-S1 antigen (Ag), pre-S2 Ag, and anti-HBx, in 88 chronic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. New IMx assays for HBsAg and immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HBc detection were also used. The population studied was composed of 65 chronic hepatitis cases (40 positive for hepatitis B antigen [HBeAg] and 25 positive for anti-HBe) and 23 anti-HBe-positive, asymptomatic HBsAg carriers. Serum HBsAg levels detected by IMx were higher in HBeAg-positive than in anti-HBe-positive HBsAg carriers (all patient subgroups included) and correlated with the serum HBV DNA level (P = 0.0001). Both pre-S1 and pre-S2 Ags were detected by enzyme immunoassays in almost all HBsAg carriers. Both pre-S1 and pre-S2 Ag titers correlated positively with the serum HBsAg concentration (P = 0.0001), but only the pre-S1 Ag titer correlated with the level of serum HBV DNA (P = 0.02). The detection of low levels of IgM anti-hepatitis B core (anti-HBc) antibodies by IMx was associated with the presence of liver disease (P = 0.05) but not with the level of viral replication. The prevalence of anti-HBx antibodies detected by the enzyme immunoassay was slightly, although not significantly, higher in patients with high levels of HBV DNA (greater than 100 pg/ml) than in patients without detectable HBV DNA (P = 0.16). In anti-HBe-positive chronic HBsAg carriers, the quantitative detection of serum HBV DNA, pre-S Ag titers, and IgM anti HBc allowed us to predict which patients suffered from chronic liver disease and/or supported viral replication (P < 0.05). In a follow-up study of eight patients undergoing antiviral therapy, the clearance of both pre-S1 Ag and HBV DNA was associated with a subsequent clearance of HBV. Therefore, the quantitative determination of HBV DNA, pre-S Ags, IgM anti-HBc may prove useful for the decision to use and the monitoring of antiviral therapy, especially in anti-HBe-positive HBsAg carriers."
6240,0.002,2.0000,"To evaluate exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV) in dental operators, we surveyed 297 students of the Dental School, University of Milano, and 526 dentists registered at the Italian Dental Association (A.M.D.I.) of Lombardia. Out of 297 students, 10.8% had one or more serologic markers of HBV infection; none was hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. No significant difference in seropositivity was detected among students in relation to sex, age, or possible risk factors investigated. Out of 526 practitioners, 2.3% were positive for HBsAg, and 37.3% were antibody positive. The seropositivity increased progressively with age and years of professional experience, reaching the highest proportion in dentists with 30 years or more of practice (79.3%). Of those who had suffered from clinical hepatitis during their curriculum, 81.1% were seropositive compared with 34.5% observed in dentists without a prior clinical history of viral hepatitis. The proportion of seropositive dentists did not vary significantly with a history of blood transfusion, size of their practice, presence or absence (or unawareness) of subjects at high risk for HBV infection among their patients. The seropositivity was significantly lower in dentists who routinely adopted mask and gloves (21.1%) compared with those who never and/or occasionally used such barriers (46.3%). The result of the study confirmed that hepatitis B does remain a significant hazard for dental professionals, hence immunization with hepatitis B vaccine should be delivered early in their employment."
7666,0.002,2.0000,"National programmes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination are recommended by the World Health Organization for all countries. Countries suffering the highest burden of HBV disease are those most needy of universal vaccination, but are frequently of very low income and resources for health care are scarce. The introduction of HBV vaccination would inevitably stretch these resources further even with support of donor agencies. Thus an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of HBV vaccination is desirable to assist in decision making about resource allocation. We describe here a method for estimating the additional costs of introducing HBV vaccination into the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) at a national level. Of fundamental importance is that this method enables costs to be assessed prior to the introduction of vaccination. We illustrate the method using a study carried out at the sub-national level, in the city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, but which can be expanded countrywide. The method, in brief, involved the use of a number of questionnaires which could be used to estimate the costs associated with the EPI programme from a large sample of the static clinics as well as from central sources. Since unit costs were collected along with the quantities of resources used and estimates of the capacity used for certain facilities (such as refrigerators), the additional cost of introducing HBV vaccine could be estimated largely by extrapolation of the resources used in vaccinating against diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus vaccine (which, similar to HBV vaccine, requires three doses). The estimation of costs is only part of the information required to make decisions on resource allocation, and should be used in association with measures of the burden of disease due to the infection in the community and effectiveness of the control programme at reducing this burden. The prediction of the latter, based upon a sound epidemiological understanding of the infection, is the subject of a forthcoming paper."
7795,0.002,2.0000,"In most HIV-1-infected patients, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reduces plasma viral load to <50 copies/mL and increases CD4+ T-cell number and function. However, it is still unclear whether alterations of T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain variable region (BV) repertoire, tightly related to disease progression, can be fully recovered by long-term treatment with HAART. This study analyzed the evolution of both T-cell subset composition and TCRBV perturbations in chronically HIV-1-infected patients with moderate immunodeficiency during 36 months of HAART. Despite persistently suppressed HIV replication, the rate of CD4+ T-cell repopulation, after an initial burst, progressively declined throughout the study period, resulting in a mean CD4+ T-cell count at the end of follow-up that was still significantly lower in HIV patients than in HIV-seronegative controls. This was seen in association with an incomplete restitution of both CD4 and CD8 TCRBV repertoire disruptions and was also demonstrated by the appearance of new TCRBV oligoclonal expansions occurring during HAART. In conclusion, these data indicate that 3 years of fully suppressive HAART may be not adequate to normalize CD4 counts and TCRBV repertoires in patients starting HAART with moderately advanced disease."
9638,0.002,2.0000,"Quantitative assays for viral nucleic acids have been instrumental in monitoring the response of patients to various antiviral therapies. The level of viraemia is predictive of clinical outcome in that a reduced risk of progression to AIDS or death was observed with lower plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA levels. Rebound in viral levels often signals therapeutic failures, some of which are associated with the development of drug resistance. Quantitative plasma assays for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been developed. Over time, modifications to these assays have been required to meet new demands. For example, as antiviral therapies have become more effective, HIV and HCV assays of greater sensitivity are required in order to follow patients for longer periods of time and to fully assess the extent of viral suppression. For HIV-1, a large percentage of patients treated with combination therapies had viral loads that were below the detection limit of the ultrasensitive assay (50 copies/ml). To assess the residual viral burden in this patient population an assay to quantify HIV-1 proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was developed. Studies to date indicate that proviral DNA remains easily detectable despite undetectable plasma RNA and may be useful in monitoring this patient population. To increase assay throughput, a new generation of quantitative assays that will provide real-time detection and a 6 log10 detection range from a single amplification is under development."
1150,0.002,2.0000,"Substantial changes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related sexual behavior have been reported by virtually every survey of homosexual/bisexual men in the last decade. This paper uses a behavior-based simulation to examine how such changes are likely to affect the long-term future of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic among homosexual men. Data from the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project in New York City are used to estimate age-specific patterns of unprotected anogenital contact and behavioral change from 1980 to 1991. Model projections are validated using New York City surveillance data on AIDS incidence from 1981 to 1991. The current levels of unsafe sex reported in the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project are shown to be almost exactly on the epidemic threshold. If this behavior were maintained, HIV prevalence would slowly decline in the population, but with just one additional unsafe sexual partner per year HIV would instead become endemic, with seroprevalence of about 65% in the oldest group and about 25% in the youngest. Transmission dynamics in the youngest group are analyzed in detail. For this group, the assortative age-matching bias in partner selection patterns raises the unsafe behavior threshold slightly in the long run."
2372,0.002,2.0000,"Injecting drug users (IDUs) are at risk of parenterally transmitted diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The present study was undertaken to find out the prevalence of HIV infection, HBV infection and HCV infection among IDUs of a deaddiction centre. Serum samples from 250, injecting drug users (IDUs) from a de-addiction centre were screened for HBsAg using immunochromatography, anti HCV antibody by 3rd generation ELISA test and anti HIV antibody by ELISA test and immunochromatographic rapid test during the period August to October 2002. One hundred and forty-nine (59.6%) IDUs were positive for HIV antibody, 226 (90.4%) were positive for anti HCV antibody and 27 (10.8%) were positive for HBsAg. There was co-infection of HIV, HBV and HCV in 15 (6%) of the IDUs. The Co-infection of HBV and HCV were found in 12 cases (4.8%) and Co-infection of HIV and HCV was found in 131 cases (52.4%). The IDUs were in sexually active age group with a risk of infection to their sexual partner. There is high prevalence of HCV and HIV infection and co-infection of both viruses among IDUs. Comprehensive public health interventions targeting this population and their sexual partners must be encouraged. Increase coverage of needle, syringe exchange programme (NSEP) to young and new IDUs is required before they are exposed to blood borne viruses."
3242,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag protease cleavage sites (CS) undergo sequence changes during the development of resistance to several protease inhibitors (PIs). We have analyzed the association of sequence variation at the p7/p1 and p1/p6 CS in conjunction with amprenavir (APV)-specific protease mutations following PI combination therapy with APV. Querying a central resistance data repository resulted in the detection of significant associations (P < 0.001) between the presence of APV protease signature mutations and Gag L449F (p1/p6 LP1'F) and P453L (p1/p6 PP5'L) CS changes. In population-based sequence analyses the I50V mutant was invariably linked to either L449F or P453L. Clonal analysis revealed that both CS mutations were never present in the same genome. Sequential plasma samples from one patient revealed a transition from I50V M46L P453L viruses at early time points to I50V M46I L449F viruses in later samples. Various combinations of the protease and Gag mutations were introduced into the HXB2 laboratory strain of HIV-1. In both single- and multiple-cycle assay systems and in the context of I50V, the L449F and P453L changes consistently increased the 50% inhibitory concentration of APV, while the CS changes alone had no measurable effect on inhibitor sensitivity. The decreased in vitro fitness of the I50V mutant was only partially improved by addition of either CS change (I50V M46I L449F mutant replicative capacity approximately 16% of that of wild-type virus). Western blot analysis of Pr55 Gag precursor cleavage products from infected-cell cultures indicated accumulation of uncleaved Gag p1-p6 in all I50V viruses without coexisting CS changes. Purified I50V protease catalyzed cleavage of decapeptides incorporating the L449F or P453L change 10-fold and 22-fold more efficiently than cleavage of the wild-type substrate, respectively. HIV-1 protease CS changes are selected during PI therapy and can have effects on both viral fitness and phenotypic resistance to PIs."
463,0.002,2.0000,"The clinical spectrum of AIDS and changes of morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection following initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are rarely described in the less developed countries in the Asia-Pacific region. We prospectively observed on a follow-up basis 309 HIV-infected patients (82.8% with AIDS) at National Taiwan University Hospital in Taiwan, where highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been provided to all patients at no charge at any stage of HIV infection since April 1, 1997, to describe the spectrum of HIV-associated opportunistic diseases and evaluate changes of morbidity and mortality from June 24, 1994 through June 23, 1999. Of the patients, 59.3% at study entry had a CD4+ lymphocyte count of <50 cells/microliter. The five leading HIV-associated opportunistic infections included oroesophageal candidiasis (195 patients), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (93), tuberculosis (77), mucocutaneous herpes simplex infection (74), and cytomegalovirus diseases (73). The incidence rates of seven major AIDS-defining opportunistic diseases were declining though the changes of the relative proportions varied. The median duration of hospitalization decreased from 36 days in 1995 to 12 days in 1999 (p =.0001). Overestimated mortality rate declined from 148.4 per 100 patient-years in 1995 to 7.4 per 100 patient-years in 1999 (p =.0001) whereas the underestimated mortality rate declined from 110.5 to 5.39 per 100 patient-years (p =.0001). Risk ratio (RR) for mortality in patients who received HAART compared with those who did not was 0.410 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.249-0.674; p =.0004) and the RR was 0.250 (95% CI, 0.127-0.492; p =.0001) when the analysis was limited to patients with an initial CD4+ lymphocyte count <100 cells/microliter and follow-up duration >30 days after adjusting for their age, gender, type of risk behavior, and CD4+ lymphocyte count. Morbidity and mortality were declining with each study year even in a population consisting mainly of patients at the advanced stage of HIV infection in Taiwan. Earlier diagnosis, accumulation of clinical experience, and use of HAART were associated with lower mortality rates."
4804,0.002,2.0000,"CCR5 antagonists are a powerful new class of antiretroviral drugs that require a companion assay to evaluate the presence of CXCR4-tropic (non-R5) viruses prior to use in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. In this study, we have developed, characterized, verified, and prevalidated a novel phenotypic test to determine HIV-1 coreceptor tropism (VERITROP) based on a sensitive cell-to-cell fusion assay. A proprietary vector was constructed containing a near-full-length HIV-1 genome with the yeast uracil biosynthesis (URA3) gene replacing the HIV-1 env coding sequence. Patient-derived HIV-1 PCR products were introduced by homologous recombination using an innovative yeast-based cloning strategy. The env-expressing vectors were then used in a cell-to-cell fusion assay to determine the presence of R5 and/or non-R5 HIV-1 variants within the viral population. Results were compared with (i) the original version of Trofile (Monogram Biosciences, San Francisco, CA), (ii) population sequencing, and (iii) 454 pyrosequencing, with the genotypic data analyzed using several bioinformatics tools, i.e., the 11/24/25 rule, Geno2Pheno (2% to 5.75%, 3.5%, or 10% false-positive rate [FPR]), and webPSSM. VERITROP consistently detected minority non-R5 variants from clinical specimens, with an analytical sensitivity of 0.3%, with viral loads of ≥1,000 copies/ml, and from B and non-B subtypes. In a pilot study, a 73.7% (56/76) concordance was observed with the original Trofile assay, with 19 of the 20 discordant results corresponding to non-R5 variants detected using VERITROP and not by the original Trofile assay. The degree of concordance of VERITROP and Trofile with population and deep sequencing results depended on the algorithm used to determine HIV-1 coreceptor tropism. Overall, VERITROP showed better concordance with deep sequencing/Geno2Pheno at a 0.3% detection threshold (67%), whereas Trofile matched better with population sequencing (79%). However, 454 sequencing using Geno2Pheno at a 10% FPR and 0.3% threshold and VERITROP more accurately predicted the success of a maraviroc-based regimen. In conclusion, VERITROP may promote the development of new HIV coreceptor antagonists and aid in the treatment and management of HIV-infected individuals prior to and/or during treatment with this class of drugs."
2398,0.002,2.0000,"In the current study we investigated the prevalence of the TNF-α 238G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the TNF-α gene in the development of lipodystrophy among HIV-1 infected individuals who had been receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the immunodeficiency clinics of the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) at Pune, India. We assessed the association of this SNP with the development of lipoatrophy/dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in these patients and measured carotid intima thickening which is a surrogate marker for chronic cardiac morbidity. Our results show that the incidence of the TNF-α 238G/A SNP is ~ two fold higher in patients with lipodystrophy as compared to those without lipodystrophy. Patients with lipodystrophy demonstrated a higher likelihood of the development of metabolic syndrome as evident by increased insulin sensitivity and increased percentage (%) β cell function. Further, a significant increase in left carotid intima thickness was observed in patients with lipodystrophy. Our study validates the association of the TNF-α 238G/A SNP allelic variant with the development of HIV- lipodystrophy via the modulation of TNF-α production, which contributes to dyslipidemia, increased lipolysis, increased insulin resistance, altered differentiation of adipocytes and increased carotid intima thickness. The contribution of genetic determinants such as the TNF-α 238G/A SNP to lipodystrophy, may provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie this disease condition and may be useful in the future for personalized therapy. Additionally, these findings will be useful in monitoring chronic cardiac morbidities among HIV infected individuals who express this SNP. "
2353,0.002,2.0000,"Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in a significant decrease of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) morbidity and mortality, the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia (HAD) has actually risen, due to the increasing life expectancy of the infected subjects. To date, several aspects of the HAD pathogenesis remain to be dissected. In particular, the viral-cellular protein interplay is still under investigation. Given their specific features, two viral proteins, Tat and Nef, have been mainly hypothesized to play a role in HIV neuropathology. Here we show that HIV-1 Nef has an effect on the transcriptional levels of a cellular protein, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), that is preferentially expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system at late embryonic stages. By its overexpression along with Nef, the authors demonstrate ALK ability to influence, at least in the U87MG astrocytic glioma cells, the mytogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-K)-dependent pathway. Moreover, although in the absence of a physical direct interaction, Nef and ALK activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are likely to contribute to blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage in HAD. Finally, in the in vitro model of glioblastoma cells adopted, Nef and ALK show similar effects by increasing different cytochines/chemokines that may be relevant for HAD pathogenesis. If confirmed in vivo, these data may indicate that, thanks to its ability to interfere with specific cellular pathways involved in BBB damage and in central nervous system (CNS) integrity, Nef, along with specific cellular counterparts, could be one of the viral players implicated in HAD development."
7725,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne pathogen that has a worldwide distribution and infects millions of people. Care-associated HCV infections represented a huge part of hepatitis C burden in the past via contaminated blood and unsafe injections and continue to be a serious problem of public health. The present review proposes a panorama of health care-associated HCV infections via the three mode of contamination that have been identified: (1) infected patient to non-infected patient; (2) infected patient to non-infected health care worker (HCW); and (3) infected HCW to non infected patient. For each condition, the circumstances of contamination are described together with the means to prevent them. As a whole, the more important risk is represented by unsafe practices regarding injections, notably with the improper use of multidose vials used for multiple patients. The questions of occupational exposures and infected HCWs are also discussed. In terms of prevention and surveillance, the main arm for combating care-associated HCV infections is the implementation of standard precautions in all the fields of cares, with training programs and audits to verify their good application. HCWs must be sensitized to the risk of blood-borne pathogens, notably by the use of safety devices for injections and good hygiene practices in the operating theatre and in all the invasive procedures. The providers performing exposed-prone procedures must monitor their HCV serology regularly in order to detect early any primary infection and to treat it without delay. With the need to stay vigilant because HCV infection is often a hidden risk, it can be hoped that the number of people infected by HCV via health care will decrease very significantly in the next years.

3463,0.002,2.0000,"Depression is one of the most prevalent psychiatric comorbidities of HIV and one of the greatest barriers to HIV self-care and adherence. Despite this, little consensus exists on how to best measure depression among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in African settings. Measurement of depression among PLWHA may be confounded by somatic symptoms. Some research recommends excluding these items to enhance measurement validity; sensitivity may be lost with this approach. We sought to characterize depression among a cohort (N = 453) of PLWHA initiating antiretroviral therapy in Uganda via factor analysis of a widely used measure of depression, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCLD). Common factor analysis was performed, associations between HSCLD and the Mental Health subscale of the Medical Outcomes Study HIV (MOS-HIV) estimated, and a Cronbach's alpha calculated to examine validity. Factor analysis yielded two factors: (1) somatic-cognitive symptoms and (2) behavioral disengagement. Persons with more versus less advanced disease (CD4 cell count of ≤200 cells/mm(3)) showed no statistically significant differences in depression scores (1.7 vs. 1.7, P ≥ 0.5). Both factors were significantly associated with the MOS-HIV (P < .01). Factor one was highly reliable (α = .81); factor two had only modest reliability (α = .65). Somatic-cognitive symptoms of depression and disengagement from life's activities appear to be distinct components of depression in this sample. Consideration of somatic items may be valuable in identifying depression in this setting."
2351,0.002,2.0000,"While patients with liver disease are known to have a higher prevalence of glucose intolerance, preliminary studies suggest that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may be an additional risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus. To further study the correlation of HCV infection and diabetes, we performed a retrospective analysis of 1,117 patients with chronic viral hepatitis and analyzed whether age, sex, race, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HCV infection, and cirrhosis were independently associated with diabetes. In addition, a case-control study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of HCV infection in a cohort of 594 diabetics and 377 clinic patients assessed for thyroid disease. In the former study after the exclusion of patients with conditions predisposing to hyperglycemia, diabetes was observed in 21% of HCV-infected patients compared with 12% of HBV-infected subjects (P =.0004). Multivariate analysis revealed that HCV infection (P =.02) and age (P =.01) were independent predictors of diabetes. In the diabetes cohort, 4.2% of patients were found to be infected with HCV compared with 1.6% of control patients (P =.02). HCV genotype 2a was observed in 29% of HCV-RNA-positive diabetic patients versus 3% of local HCV-infected controls (P <.005). In conclusion, the data suggest a relatively strong association between HCV infection and diabetes, because diabetics have an increased frequency of HCV infection, particularly with genotype 2a. Furthermore, it is possible that HCV infection may serve as an additional risk factor for the development of diabetes, beyond that attributable to chronic liver disease alone."
2991,0.002,2.0000,"HIV-related stigma remains a persistent global health concern among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWA) in developing nations. The literature is lacking in studies about healthcare students' perceptions of PLWA. This study is the first effort to understand stigmatizing attitudes toward HIV-positive patients by healthcare students in Mwanza, Tanzania, not just those who will be directly treating patients but also those who will be indirectly involved through nonclinical roles, such as handling patient specimens and private health information. A total of 208 students were drawn from Clinical Medicine, Laboratory Sciences, Health Records and Information Management, and Community Health classes at the Tandabui Institute of Health Sciences and Technology for a voluntary survey that assessed stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. Students generally obtained high scores on the overall survey instrument, pointing to low stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA and an overall willingness to treat PLWA with the same standard of care as other patients. However, there are gaps in knowledge that exist among students, such as a comprehensive understanding of all routes of HIV infection. The study also suggests that students who interact with patients as part of their training are less likely to exhibit stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. A comprehensive course in HIV infection, one that includes classroom sessions focused on the epidemiology and routes of transmission as well as clinical opportunities to directly interact with PLWA-perhaps through teaching sessions led by PLWA-may allow for significant reductions in stigma toward such patients and improve clinical outcomes for PLWA around the world."
306,0.002,2.0000,"Cellular immune responses during acute Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infection are a known correlate of infection outcome. Viral adaptation to these responses via mutation(s) within CD8+ T-cell epitopes allows these viruses to subvert host immune control. This study examined HCV evolution in 21 HCV genotype 1-infected subjects to characterise the level of viral adaptation during acute and early HCV infection. Of the total mutations observed 25% were within described CD8+ T-cell epitopes or at viral adaptation sites. Most mutations were maintained into the chronic phase of HCV infection (75%). The lack of reversion of adaptations and high proportion of silent substitutions suggests that HCV has structural and functional limitations that constrain evolution. These results were compared to the pattern of viral evolution observed in 98 subjects during a similar phase in HIV infection from a previous study. In contrast to HCV, evolution during acute HIV infection is marked by high levels of amino acid change relative to silent substitutions, including a higher proportion of adaptations, likely reflecting strong and continued CD8+ T-cell pressure combined with greater plasticity of the virus. Understanding viral escape dynamics for these two viruses is important for effective T cell vaccine design."
3936,0.002,2.0000,"Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection is common in Egypt and other developing countries. Patients coinfected with HCV and schistosomiasis exhibit a unique clinical, virological and histological pattern manifested by viral persistence with high HCV RNA titers as well as higher necroinflammatory and fibrosis scores in their liver biopsy samples. Dual infections of schistosomiasis and viral infections display significant influences on host immune reactions including cytokine shift pattern alteration, cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and other impaired immunologic functions with diminished capacity to clear the virus. We investigated the cytokine pattern against HCV and S. mansoni antigens in patients coinfected with HCV and S. mansoni and compared them with responses in patients infected with HCV or S. mansoni alone. This study included 4 groups; (Gr I) included 20 patients infected with chronic HCV, their sera were reactive for anti-HCV antibodies, samples were verified for RNA detection to identify those who have viremia. (Gr II) included 15 patients infected with schistosomiasis alone, they were subjected to detection of S. mansoni ova in stool, rectal snip or serological test. (Gr III) included 20 patients with chronic HCV and schistosomiasis coinfection, which were diagnosed by the above-mentioned criteria. (Gr IV) included 15 healthy individuals, who were matched for age and sex and have no evidence of liver diseases served as control subjects. The results showed that a highly significant increase in serum IFN-gamma and IL-18 levels in patients infected with HCV alone compared with the other patient groups and control. On the other hand, a highly significant increase was found in serum IL-4 and IL-10 levels in coinfected patients and patients with schistosomiasis alone compared with the control but a significant increase was found in the two groups compared with HCV patients. A significant increase in serum IL-4 and IL-10 were also found in HCV patients compared with the control. In conclusions, our data showed that coinfected patients have dominant Th2 cytokine profile induced by S. mansoni and this Th2 antagonized and down-regulated the antiviral activities of Th1 cytokine profile in HCV infection that probably acquired after S. mansoni infection resulting in failing to mount significant HCV specific Th1 response and thereby fail to clear the virus in coinfected, compared with patients infected with HCV or schistosomiasis alone."
656,0.002,2.0000,"HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected individuals have accelerated liver disease, increased drug toxicities, and modest responses to peginterferon and ribavirin. Hematologic toxicities necessitating dose reduction or discontinuation are limiting factors to HCV treatment in the coinfected patient. This study aimed to identify predictors for the need of filgrastim and darbepoetin to manage hematologic toxicities so as to maintain patients on full doses of study drugs for the duration of study. The primary study was a single-center, open-label, prospective study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and viral kinetics of 48-week peginterferon alfa 2b and ribavirin in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Complete blood count was monitored at baseline, days 3, 7, 10, 14, and then weekly for the first month, fortnightly until week 8, then monthly from week 12 to 48. Filgrastim was initiated when absolute neutrophil count (ANC) fell below 750 cells/mm(3) and darbepoetin was used when hemoglobin dropped to less than 10 g/dL. All patients experienced decrease in ANC and hemoglobin. Twenty of 30 (66.6%) of patients required hematopoeitic growth factors, 15 (50%) received filgrastim, and 12 (40%) received darbepoetin. Seven (23.3%) required both. Baseline ANC of less than 2250 cells per millimeter and negative rate of change of hemoglobin on day 3 of therapy were excellent predictors for filgrastim and darbepoetin use, respectively. Supplemental growth factors were associated with substantial increase in overall cost for HCV treatment. Larger clinical trials will be needed to address the cost effectiveness of supplemental growth factor use in the HIV/HCV-coinfected patients."
564,0.002,2.0000,"Antibody to hepatitis E virus of IgG class (anti-HEV IgG) is regularly detected in industrialized countries, where HEV is non-endemic, at levels not exceeding 2-3%; seropositive individuals are often found in certain groups of patients and professionals exposed to an increased risk of blood-borne infections. The present study was aimed at the identification of anti-HEV IgG in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), living in Russia and Belarus, an area of low anti-HEV prevalence with a moderate spread of HIV infection and AIDS. In Russia, 13 out of 117 HIV-infected patients (11.1%) were found to be anti-HEV seropositive. This differed significantly from the frequency observed in the normal population (1.7%) but not from the frequency in a matching control, high-risk group consisting of male prisoners (8.0%). No difference in the frequency of anti-HEV IgG seropositivity was found between groups of HIV-infected men subdivided by sexual orientation. The rate of anti-HEV seropositivity increased with the progression of HIV infection, reaching 43.3% in AIDS patients and 38.1% in those who died from AIDS. In Belarus, anti-HEV IgG seropositivity was not found among 20 HIV-infected subjects nor among individuals from the control risk group, which consisted of 25 intravenous drug users. In conclusion, HEV infection may have common transmission mechanisms (risk factors) with HIV infection rather than represent an additional opportunistic infection in AIDS."
3170,0.002,2.0000,"Profiles of CD8+CD11+ T suppressor cells, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-env-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activities, and natural killer (NK) cell activity were studied in 12 asymptomatic untreated HIV-infected patients. These patients were followed for 4-7 months. NK activity, HIV-env-specific CTL activities mediated by CD4+, CD8+ T cells and CD8+CD11+ T-suppressor cell number remained stable in seven patients during the study period. Alternatively, NK and HIV-specific CTL activities decreased and CD8+CD11+ cell number increased in five patients whose CD4+ T-cell number fell, and in four of these five patients serum p24 antigen level increased, and they developed minor clinical signs of disease progression during the study period. CD8+CD11+ cells are present in higher percentage (10-45% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells) in these HIV-infected patients as compared to those in normal individuals (3-5%). Our results suggest that CD8+CD11+ cells, NK, and HIV-specific cytotoxic activities may be helpful in monitoring prognosis of HIV infection. These observations also suggest that CD8+CD11+ cells may play an important role in the failure of host immune defences against HIV."
5309,0.002,2.0000,"The importance of HLA class I-restricted CD8 T-cell responses in the control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is generally accepted. While several studies have shown an association of certain HLA class I alleles with slower disease progression, it is not fully established whether this effect is mediated by HIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses restricted by these alleles. In order to study the influence of the HLA class I alleles on the HIV-specific CD8 T-cell response and on viral control, we have assessed HIV-specific epitope recognition, plasma viral load, and expression of HLA class I alleles in a cohort of HIV-seropositive bar workers. Possession of the HLA class I alleles B5801, B8101, and B0702 was associated with a low median viral load and simultaneously with a broader median recognition of Gag epitopes compared to all other HLA alleles (twofold increase) (P = 0.0035). We further found an inverse linear relationship between the number of Gag epitopes recognized and the plasma viral load (R = -0.36; P = 0.0016). Particularly, recognition of multiple epitopes within two regions of Gag (amino acids [aa] 1 to 75 and aa 248 to 500) was associated with the maintenance of a low steady-state viremia, even years after acute infection."
2477,0.002,2.0000,"Potent antiretroviral therapy can reduce human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in plasma to levels below the limit of detection for up to 2 years, but the extent to which viral replication is suppressed is unknown. To search for ongoing viral replication in 10 patients on combination antiretroviral therapy for up to 1 year, the emergence of genotypic drug resistance across different compartments was studied and correlated with plasma viral RNA levels. In addition, lymph node (LN) mononuclear cells were assayed for the presence of multiply spliced RNA. Population sequencing of HIV-1 pol was done on plasma RNA, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) RNA, PBMC DNA, LN RNA, LN DNA, and RNA from virus isolated from PBMCs or LNs. A special effort was made to obtain sequences from patients with undetectable plasma RNA, emphasizing the rapidly emerging lamivudine-associated M184V mutation. Furthermore, concordance of drug resistance mutations across compartments was investigated. No evidence for viral replication was found in patients with plasma HIV RNA levels of <20 copies/ml. In contrast, evolving genotypic drug resistance or the presence of multiply spliced RNA provided evidence for low-level replication in subjects with plasma HIV RNA levels between 20 and 400 copies/ml. All patients failing therapy showed multiple drug resistance mutations in different compartments, and multiply spliced RNA was present upon examination. Concordance of nucleotide sequences from different tissue compartments obtained concurrently from individual patients was high: 98% in the protease and 94% in the reverse transcriptase regions. These findings argue that HIV replication differs significantly between patients on potent antiretroviral therapy with low but detectable viral loads and those with undetectable viral loads."
8390,0.002,2.0000,"Over the previous years, comprehensive studies on antiretroviral drugs resulted in the successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) into clinical practice for treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there is still need for new therapeutic approaches, since HAART cannot eradicate HIV-1 from the infected organism and, unfortunately, can be associated with long-term toxicity and the development of drug resistance. In contrast, novel gene therapy strategies may have the potential to reverse the infection by eradicating HIV-1. For example, expression of long terminal repeat (LTR)-specific recombinase (Tre-recombinase) has been shown to result in chromosomal excision of proviral DNA and, in consequence, in the eradication of HIV-1 from infected cell cultures. However, the delivery of Tre-recombinase currently depends on the genetic manipulation of target cells, a process that is complicating such therapeutic approaches and, thus, might be undesirable in a clinical setting. In this report we demonstrate that E.coli expressed Tre-recombinases, tagged either with the protein transduction domain (PTD) from the HIV-1 Tat trans-activator or the translocation motif (TLM) of the Hepatitis B virus PreS2 protein, were able to translocate efficiently into cells and showed significant recombination activity on HIV-1 LTR sequences. Tre activity was observed using episomal and stable integrated reporter constructs in transfected HeLa cells. Furthermore, the TLM-tagged enzyme was able to excise the full-length proviral DNA from chromosomal integration sites of HIV-1-infected HeLa and CEM-SS cells. The presented data confirm Tre-recombinase activity on integrated HIV-1 and provide the basis for the non-genetic transient application of engineered recombinases, which may be a valuable component of future HIV eradication strategies."
1264,0.002,2.0000,"A 5-month-old white girl having persistent oral candidiasis was brought to medical attention because of acute respiratory distress, pneumonia, and hypoxia that worsened despite supportive care and antibiotics. Bronchial lavage fluid yielded Pneumocystis carinii. The diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was suspected, although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot tests were both negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Immunologic evaluation included the following results: a low normal CD4/CD8 ratio 0.88, CD4 lymphocytes 493/microL, and elevated IgA 539 mg/dL and IgM 175 mg/dL with normal IgG 492 mg/dL. Lymphocyte stimulation study results were depressed. Lymphocytes sent for culture were subsequently positive for HIV. The mother was HIV antibody positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot but belonged to no high-risk group and was asymptomatic except for chronic diarrhea. The father was HIV antibody negative. The patient was treated with pentamidine and IV gamma-globulin with good clinical response and a rapid decrease of IgM and IgA toward normal values. Subsequent candidal pneumonia and candidal esophagitis were treated successfully with amphotericin B. The patient has received prophylactic IV gamma-globulin infusions for 6 months and remains HIV negative by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. This case of pediatric AIDS highlights the need to consider HIV infection in the differential diagnosis of any child with physical findings or illnesses suggestive of AIDS-related complex or AIDS, even when HIV serologic findings are negative and parents belong to no high-risk group. Parental testing for HIV antibody is suggested in such cases."
2007,0.002,2.0000,"Neutropenia occurs in approximately 17% of symptomatic patients infected with HIV. Results of studies have failed to demonstrate a consistent relationship between HIV-related neutropenia and the subsequent development of bacterial infections. This was a case control study to determine if HIV-related neutropenia was associated with increased rates of bacteremia. The experimental group was comprised of 29 patients infected with HIV that had an absolute neutrophil count less than 1000 cells/mm3 and were paired with 29 control subjects infected with HIV that had been matched for age, sex, CD4 count, and month and year of entry. The frequency of bacteremia was 12.6 per 100 patient months among the experimental group compared to a frequency of 0.87 per 100 patient months among the control group (relative risk [RR] = 14.9, P = 0.0027). Other independent risks for the development of bacteremia included central venous catheters (RR = 3.9, P = 0.03), with a trend toward increased risk for bacteremia in those patients who were intravenous drug users (RR = 3.8, P = 0.11), or who had infiltrative bone marrow disease (RR = 3.1, P = 0.11). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that neutropenia (odds ratio [OR] = 22.6, P = 0.028) and the presence of a central venous catheter (OR = 8.5, P = 0.026) were significant risks for bacteremia. These data suggest that neutropenia is a significant risk for the development of bacteremia in patients infected with HIV."
1497,0.002,2.0000,"The aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility to T20 and the dynamics of amino acid changes in HR1 and HR2 of gp41 of HIV-1 obtained from plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and primary isolates (PI) in four highly antiretroviral-experienced patients. These patients received T20 plus an antiretroviral regimen and were followed-up over a period of 40-72 weeks. In one non-responder patient, N43D substitution was detected at 12 weeks of treatment, in association with a value of T20-IC50 of 10 microg/ml (10-fold increase). Double mutations N42T + N43D were observed in plasma RNA at 32 weeks and remained detectable up to 16 weeks after the withdrawal of the drug. The S138A substitution in HR2 was observed in plasma RNA at 32 weeks, and both in plasma RNA and in PI DNA at 40 weeks, associated with an increase of the T20-IC50 to 25 microg/ml (25-fold increase). Mutations V101G and E137K, not reported previously, were also observed in the HR2 region. Whether these new substitutions play a role in T20 resistance needs to be examined. In three temporary responders, coinciding with viral load rebound, G36D, and N42T substitutions were observed at 12, 24, and 40 weeks. G36D mutation was associated with a value of T20-IC50 of 5 microg/ml. The HR2 S138A mutation was detected after the detection of HR1 substitutions and was associated with an increase in the level of T20-IC50 to 125 microg/ml (125-fold increase) All these data reinforce the role of gp41 amino acids 36-45 and the potential influence of the HR2 S138A mutation in the genotypic/phenotypic resistance to T20."
1145,0.002,2.0000,"Long-term medication regimen adherence is challenging in all populations, but in the HIV-infected adolescent population the frequency of poverty, homelessness, substance abuse, and mental illness make highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence even more challenging. In 2003, we developed a pilot program for HIV-infected adolescents and young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 who were either going to begin a HAART regimen for the first time or begin a new HAART regimen. Participants received a free cell phone with a local service plan for approximately 6 months. Participants received phone call reminders for 12 weeks. Call frequency was tapered at 4-week intervals. Patients were assessed at 4-week intervals to determine the perceived intrusiveness or helpfulness of receiving calls, and missed medication doses. Eight consecutive patients were recruited for the study, and five were able to complete it through the 24 weeks. Most participants found the calls to be helpful and the level of intrusion into their daily lives acceptable. Using cell phone reminders to assist patients does not require an extensive amount of daily staff time. Tapering calls rapidly over 3 months, followed by discontinuation of calls provided inadequate support for subjects, especially those with significant psychosocial issues such as substance abuse. Use of cell phone reminders to assist adolescents adhere with HIV medications was practical and acceptable to pilot study participants. Viral suppression waned for all but two patients after termination of cell phone reminders and suggests that a 12-week intervention was not adequate for most subjects. Larger prospective studies of cell phone observation of therapy will be needed to determine if this intervention can improve long-term adherence and health outcomes."
1586,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resistance to antiretroviral drugs is the main cause of patient treatment failure. Despite the problems associated with interpretation of HIV-1 resistance testing, resistance monitoring should help in the rational design of initial or rescue antiretroviral therapies. It has previously been shown that the activity of the HIV-1 protease can be monitored by using a bacteriophage lambda-based genetic assay. This genetic screening system is based on the bacteriophage lambda regulatory circuit in which the viral repressor cI is specifically cleaved to initiate the lysogenic to lytic switch. We have adapted this simple lambda-based genetic assay for the analysis of the activities and phenotypes of different HIV-1 proteases. Lambda phages that encode HIV-1 proteases either from laboratory strains (strain HXB2) or from clinical samples are inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the HIV-1 protease inhibitors indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and nelfinavir. Distinct susceptibilities to different drugs were also detected among phages that encode HIV-1 proteases carrying different resistance mutations, further demonstrating the specificity of this assay. Differences in proteolytic processing activity can also be directly monitored with this genetic screen system since two phage populations compete in culture with each other until one phage outgrows the other. In summary, we present here a simple, safe, and rapid genetic screening system that may be used to predict the activities and phenotypes of HIV-1 proteases in the course of viral infection and antiretroviral therapy. This assay responds appropriately to well-known HIV-1 protease inhibitors and can be used to search for new protease inhibitors."
9749,0.002,2.0000,"Since the discover of AIDS in 1981 and the causal human immunodeficiency virus in 1983, therapeutic strategies have gone through many phases. When the ACTG 175 and Delta trials demonstrated the clinical improvement offered by regiments combining 2 nucleosides over monotherapy, combination therapy was being prescribed for less than 20% of all primary infections. Less than one year later, this rate suddenly rose to 90%. At the same time, the clinical benefit in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality was demonstrated for triple therapy and by the end of 1997, 65% of all treated HIV+ patients were taking the triple combination therapy, 34% were on bitherapy and only 1% on single drug regimens. This fantastically rapid evolution of management strategies appears even more exceptional when one realizes that these changes in prescription attitudes took place before expert groups were able to establish accepted guidelines. The number of patients under treatment also rose sharply from 57% in early 1994 to 87% in late 1997, while the number of active hospital files rose by 30%. These rapid changes in patient management schemes has had a major effect on HIV-related morbidity and mortality. In 1997, the number of deaths fell by 41% and the number of new AIDS cases by nearly 50%. The number of hospitalizations has also declined by 50% over the last 2 years. This is probably the first time in the history in medicine that preliminary clinical studies have led to direct patient benefit in so short a time. This achievement has been accomplished by the combined efforts of health care workers, patient associations, public authorities and the pharmaceutical industry. This global view must not however hide the fact that most all the prescriptions used today are based on the results of clinical trials in a small number of patients over short study periods. Long-term efficacy and tolerance remain unknown. One must also keep in mind one other figure which has not varied over this period. The percentage of new AIDS cases in patients no ith no prior treatment because they are unaware of the infection or because they do not want treatment remains unchanged at 40%."
9389,0.002,2.0000,"From 1 January 1995 through 31 June 1997, 153 cases of coccidioidomycosis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons were identified in Arizona (incidence, 41/1000 persons living with AIDS). A case-control study was conducted to evaluate risk factors for coccidioidomycosis in HIV-infected persons. A case was defined as laboratory-confirmed, incident coccidioidomycosis in a person infected with HIV for > or =3 months, and each case patient had 3 control patients matched by county, age group, sex, HIV/AIDS status, and CD4 lymphocyte count. Multivariable analysis identified black race and a history of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis to be associated with increased risk of coccidioidomycosis; protease inhibitor therapy was associated with a reduced risk. In persons with previous history of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis, having received an azole drug was associated with a reduced risk (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.9; P=.04). Physicians may need to consider azole chemoprophylaxis for HIV-infected persons who live in areas of endemicity, have CD4 cell counts <200/microL, are black, or have a history of thrush."
1441,0.002,2.0000,"Telaprevir and boceprevir, the two first hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitors (PIs), considerably increase rates of sustained virologic response in association with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in chronic HCV genotype 1 infections. The 30 first patients treated by telaprevir or boceprevir including anti-HCV therapies since 2011 in Marseille University hospitals, France, were monitored. HCV loads and plasmatic concentrations of telaprevir and boceprevir were determined on sequential blood samples. HCV NS3 protease gene population sequencing was performed at baseline of treatment and in case of treatment failure. Fifteen patients (including 7 co-infected with HIV) received telaprevir and the other 15 patients (including 4 co-infected with HIV) received boceprevir. At baseline, HCV NS3 protease from six patients harbored amino acid substitutions associated with PI-resistance. Treatment failure occurred at week 12 for 7 patients. Amino acid substitutions associated with PI-resistance were observed in six of these cases. HCV NS3 R155K and T54A/S mutants, all of genotype 1a, were found from four patients. Median (interquartile range) plasma concentrations were 3,092 ng/ml (2,320-3,525) for telaprevir and 486 ng/ml (265-619) for boceprevir. For HIV-HCV co-infected patients, median concentrations were 3,162 ng/ml (2,270-4,232) for telaprevir and 374 ng/ml (229-519) for boceprevir. Plasma drug concentration monitoring revealed undetectable concentrations for two patients at week 4, and probable non-adherence to therapy for another patient. These findings indicate that routine HCV NS3 protease sequencing and plasma PI concentration monitoring might be helpful to characterize cases of therapy failure, at a cost dramatically low compared to that of anti-HCV therapy."
3979,0.002,2.0000,"Improvements in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated mortality make it difficult to deny transplantation based upon futility. Outcomes in the current management era are unknown. This is a prospective series of liver or kidney transplant recipients with stable HIV disease. Eleven liver and 18 kidney transplant recipients were followed for a median of 3.4 years (IQR [interquartile range] 2.9-4.9). One- and 3-year liver recipients' survival was 91% and 64%, respectively; kidney recipients' survival was 94%. One- and 3-year liver graft survival was 82% and 64%, respectively; kidney graft survival was 83%. Kidney patient and graft survival were similar to the general transplant population, while liver survival was similar to the older population, based on 1999-2004 transplants in the national database. CD4+ T-cell counts and HIV RNA levels were stable; and there were two opportunistic infections (OI). The 1- and 3-year cumulative incidence (95% confidence intervals [CI]) of rejection episodes for kidney recipients was 52% (28-75%) and 70% (48-92%), respectively. Two-thirds of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients, but no patient with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, recurred. Good transplant and HIV-related outcomes among kidney transplant recipients, and reasonable outcomes among liver recipients suggest that transplantation is an option for selected HIV-infected patients cared for at centers with adequate expertise."
3529,0.002,2.0000,"Prior to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-infected patients were usually not considered as transplant candidates because of the poor prognosis of their underlying disease and concerns regarding the potential detrimental effects of immunosuppression on viral load and immune status. However, with the significant HAART-associated improvements in morbidity and mortality, good short-term outcomes after liver and kidney transplantation for patients with HIV infection have been reported. Nevertheless, HIV infection is currently considered a contraindication to lung transplantation in most transplant centers worldwide. The results of a double lung transplant performed in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and end-stage respiratory failure (ESRF) are presented after a 2-year follow-up. Approval of and recommendations for the management of this patient were obtained from the Italian National Center for Transplantation as an extension of the ongoing Italian protocol for liver and kidney transplantation in HIV-infected individuals. The operation was successful and the patient recovered rapidly after surgery. A cautious infectious and immunosuppressive management allowed so far the avoidance of major infectious complications and rejection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of lung transplantation in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient."

Most of the patients were young males with an urban origin. The route of transmission was unknown in 8/12 cases. Abdominal pain was more frequent during the onset of the disease than in AHB (p < 0.05). A cholestatic pattern was noted in 9 cases. The frequency of severe/ fulminant cases was greater then in AHB.

1196,0.002,2.0000,"Several reports have emphasized the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders undergoing cytotoxic treatment. To determine the prevalence of occult B infection (OBI) in a population with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and management with universal prophylaxis (UP) in all patients undergoing chemoimmunotherapy or targeted prophylaxis (TP) in patients experiencing seroreversion during therapy, we analyzed 397 patients with CLL from our database. The prevalence of OBI in our patients with CLL was 8.6% (34 patients). When comparing patients with OBI/CLL with those with CLL, we did not find any statistical difference among clinical-biological parameters and time dependent endpoints except for a lower peripheral blood lymphocyte count in the OBI/CLL group (p = 0.036). From 2000 to 2010 careful follow-up and TP were adopted; two out of 10 patients (20%) showed seroreversion. From June 2010 we adopted UP during and 12 months after immunosuppressive treatment in all patients with CLL with OBI; no evidence of seroreversion was detected. "
6873,0.002,2.0000,"The biological dynamics of hepatitis C virus (HCV) viremia in uremic patients with chronic infection have not been fully characterized. We prospectively studied fluctuations of HCV-RNA in sera from 52 patients with end-stage renal disease who were undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and had chronic HCV infection. We measured HCV viremia monthly over the course of 13 months with the branched-chain DNA (bDNA) signal amplification assay and prospectively analyzed liver function, expressed by monthly serum aspartate (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations. We observed three different patterns of HCV viremia: (1) patients persistently positive by bDNA assay (persistent viremia; 23 of 52 patients; 44%), (2) individuals with alternatively positive and negative results (intermittent viremia; 17 of 52 patients; 33%), and (3) patients persistently negative by bDNA assay (12 of 52 patients; 23%). The HCV viral load over the follow-up was greater among patients with persistent compared with intermittent viremia (persistent, 31.7 x 10(5) Eq/mL; range, 6.3 x 10(5) to 16.03 x 10(6) Eq/mL versus intermittent, 10.4 x 10(5) Eq/mL; range, 1.1 x 10(5) to 9.4 x 10(6) Eq/mL; P = 0.0001). In addition, patients with persistent viremia had over time greater AST and/or ALT activities than the intermittent group (AST: persistent, 26.5 IU/L; range, 9.6 to 73.7 IU/L versus intermittent, 21.3 IU/L; range, 8 to 56.8 IU/L; P = 0.001 and ALT: persistent, 14.7 IU/L; range, 3.7 to 57.9 IU/L versus intermittent, 10.9 IU/L; range, 2.3 to 52.1 IU/L; P = 0.001). In the group with persistent viremia, the mean difference between maximum and minimum values of HCV-RNA observed in each individual patient was 2.09 +/- 0.7 natural logarithm (Log(n)) and in intermittent viremic patients, 1.55 +/- 1 Log(n) (P = 0.045). The HCV load at study entry (19.4 x 10(5) Eq/mL) was rather low and did not change versus the end of follow-up in all patients (P = not significant [NS]). In the entire group, the fluctuations in HCV-RNA levels over time between and within individuals were not significant (P = NS). No difference in variability of HCV-RNA values over time between patients infected with different HCV genotypes was seen. In conclusion, three different patterns of HCV viremia in HD over time were assessed; one third of viremic patients had intermittent viremia, and those patients had less HCV-RNA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and aminotransferase activity than did patients with persistent HCV load. Larger fluctuations in HCV RNA levels occurred in patients with persistent than with intermittent HCV viremia. However, the viremic HCV load was low and relatively stable over a 13-month follow-up in our population. Studies with longer observation periods are warranted to understand fully the natural history of HCV in these immunosuppressed individuals."
1500,0.002,2.0000,"Anemia is often a comorbidity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Many cross-sectional studies have been conducted on anemia and HIV, but few, if any, have addressed incidence of anemia prospectively. A longitudinal analysis was conducted in 48,068 nonpregnant HIV-infected adults in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, seen at Management and Development for Health-U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief HIV care and treatment programs between 2004 and 2011. Almost 56% (N = 27,184) of study participants had anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) at the time of enrollment at the clinic. Female gender, low body mass index (BMI), low CD4 T-cell count, high levels of liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase, antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens, and concurrent tuberculosis treatment were all independently significantly associated with an increased risk of anemia. Low BMI and low CD4 T-cell count were independently significantly associated with an increased risk for iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Higher BMI status and ART use were associated with recovery from anemia. Anemia, including IDA, is a comorbidity that is associated with other adverse consequences (e.g., low BMI and CD4 T-cell count) among individuals with HIV infection, including those on ART. Interventions to prevent anemia and its complications need to be examined in the context of future studies. "
9849,0.002,2.0000,"The case of a young female patient with chronic active hepatitis B, vasculitic purpura, edema, and circulating immune complexes due to mixed cryoglobulinemia is described.

Using hepatitis B virus-polymerase chain reaction (HBV-PCR) and direct sequencing a precore/core (preC/C) mutant unable to synthesize HBeAg was detected in serum. HBV antigens were demonstrated in the circulating immune complexes. Following 1 month of treatment with interferon-alpha 2b3 miu three times weekly, alanine aminotransferases returned to normal levels while cryoglobulins and immune complexes disappeared from serum. In addition, 2 months after the onset of treatment serum HBV-DNA was no longer detectable by PCR. Prior to treatment the analysis of cellular immune reactions of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a major proliferative response to HBcAg, preS1Ag and HBxAg and a minor response to HBeAg and HBsAg. One month after conclusion of treatment a decline in T-cell reactivity against all HBV antigens was observed. During clinical response to the therapy, however, a strong proliferative response of T cells to HBcAg and HBeAg was demonstrated. In conclusion, immune complex disease may complicate chronic hepatitis B in patients expressing HBe-minus HBV mutants. Treatment with interferon-alpha was found to be effective in mixed cryoglobulinemia even in the presence of HBe-minus HBV mutants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
9041,0.002,2.0000,"Mechanisms underlying failure of novel 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine-induced Ab responses in HIV-infected persons are poorly understood. This study prospectively evaluated 16 HIV-infected patients on combination antiretroviral therapy and eight healthy controls (HC) who received a single 15 μg dose of nonadjuvanted novel 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine during the 2009 H1N1 epidemic. Peripheral blood was collected at baseline (T0) and at 7 d (T1) and 28 d (T2) postvaccination for evaluation of immune responses. Prevaccination hemagglutination inhibition Ab titer was <1:20 in all except one study participant. At T2, all HC and 8 out of 16 patients (50%) developed a vaccine-induced Ab titer of ≥ 1:40. Vaccine responder (R) and vaccine nonresponder patients were comparable at T0 in age, CD4 counts, virus load, and B cell immunophenotypic characteristics. At T2, HC and R patients developed an expansion of phenotypic and functional memory B cells and ex vivo H1N1-stimulated IgG Ab-secreting cells in an ELISPOT assay. The memory B cell response was preceded by a significant expansion of plasmablasts and spontaneous H1N1-specific Ab-secreting cells at T1. At T2, HC and R patients also exhibited significant increases in serum IL-21 levels and in the frequency and mean fluorescence intensity of IL-21R-expressing B cells, which correlated with serum H1N1 Ab titers. Vaccine nonresponder patients failed to develop the above-described vaccine-induced immunologic responses. The novel association of novel 2009 H1N1 vaccine-induced Ab responses with IL-21/IL-21R upregulation and with development of memory B cells and plasmablasts has implications for future research in vaccine design."
8240,0.002,2.0000,"A survey of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) regarding human immunodeficiency virus infection was performed on 899 students from 3 government-administered high schools located in the Bangkok Metropolitan area. Initially, all students completed a written questionnaire (pre-test) regarding HIV/AIDS. Following this, they attended a slide lecture presentation given by a specialist physician. The same test questionnaire was then completed by the same students six weeks (post-test) later for comparison of their previous KAP. The subjects composed of male to female ratio equal to that of the median age 15-16 years old. Sixty-seven per cent of the subjects were living with their parents, 16.3 per cent with relatives and 15 per cent with friends. Ninety nine per cent of the subjects had received information on HIV/AIDS before enrollment to this study. The source of knowledge ranged from television (89.1%), teachers (81.6%), pamphlets (80.2%), newspapers (75%), radio (55%), health care workers (53.4%), friends (38.6%) and only 32.5 per cent from their parents. The subjects' knowledge about HIV/AIDS and risk factors in the post-test questionnaire was significantly increased (P < 0.001) from the pre-test status. However, their attitudes to an HIV infected person were not significantly changed in the post-test questionnaire: only the ""attending school"" question showed significantly (P < 0.05) increased numbers of agreement. Similarly, the attitudes and practices to prevent HIV infection were not significantly (P > 0.05) different between pre-test and post-test questionnaires. The result of this study is to recommend regular school-based programs of education to increase awareness of preventive strategies for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases."
8699,0.002,2.0000,"Identification of recent infections (RI) may contribute to improve the quality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) surveillance, monitoring ongoing transmission and planning and evaluating prevention programs. Our study applied an algorithm combining clinical and serological information to identify RI in individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in Rome, during the years 1999-2008, in order to describe the trend and characteristics of recently infected individuals. RI were documented seroconverters, or people with an HIV avidity index (AI)<0.80. Individuals with advanced infection (CD4 count <200 cells/?L or AIDS-defining illness) or with AI ?0.80 were considered long-standing infections. Overall, we observed 2,563 new HIV diagnoses. The algorithm was applied in 2124/2563 (82.9%). Of these, 355 were RI (16.7%). RI was found independently associated with calendar year (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]= 1.06, 95% confidence intervals [CI]=[CI 1.02-1.11], for every year of increase), HIV-risk category (men having sex with men: aOR=1.44, [CI 1.04-1.98]; injecting drug users: aOR=1.58, [CI 1.03-2.42] vs. heterosexuals), country of origin (foreign-born: vs Italians: aOR=0.46, [CI 0.33-0.62]), and recruitment site (inpatient vs outpatient clinic: aOR=0.49, [CI 0.37-0.66]). By the application of our algorithm we could characterize the pattern of ongoing HIV transmission, identifying groups needing more urgent prevention programs."
2684,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic hepatitis in 170 million people worldwide and can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma, a disease process accelerated in HIV co-infection. Approximately 25% of HIV infected people are co-infected with HCV (worldwide prevalence 4-5 million) and up to 16.7% of deaths in this population are attributable to HCV co-infection. Previous treatment options for HCV were limited to pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV), a combination that demonstrated lower successful cure rates in genotype 1 HCV mono-infection and HIV/HCV co-infection, and is also associated with a considerable adverse side-effect profile. The development of directly acting antivirals (DAAs) offers the first class of drug to achieve good viral suppression in previously hard-to-treat patient groups. We review the benefits, tolerability and drug interactions with concomitant drugs of the DAA simeprevir for patients who have HCV mono-infection and hep C/HIV co-infection. "
2736,0.002,2.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy dramatically decreases in vivo viral replication to levels below the level of clinical detection, but does not eradicate HIV-1 infection on the basis of persistent low-level or cryptic viral replication and latent provirus in resting CD4+ T lymphocytes. Immune activation therapy has begun to be used in attempts to increase the turnover rate of the latent virus reservoir through activation of infected cells that comprise this reservoir, in order to promote cell death and accelerate virus clearance. Recent reports have not demonstrated complete virus ablation. Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation now appears as a safe, feasible, and reasonable approach for Aids-related lymphoma in patients who meet criteria for transplantation. The hypothesis is based on the possibility that hematopoietic stem cells from a HIV-positive patient could be collected before the patient becomes infected with HIV. Then, the proposed treatment consists of the following assumptions. HAART keeps viral replication below the level of detection, limiting the infection to latent provirus in resting CD4+ T lymphocytes. It is presumed here that myeloablative conditioning regimen can lead to the killing of all the cells that, in theory, harbour the virus. The following transplantation of the autologous hematopoietic stem cells, collected before HIV infection, would allow the complete recovery. The hypothesis is to be tested on a suitable animal model. After the collection of hematopoietic stem cells, the animal is experimentally infected with the immunodeficiency virus. HAART is given after plasma viral RNA becomes detectable. By myeloablative conditioning regimen all the cells harbouring the virus are supposed to be killed. Then, as the viral load is kept undetectable by HAART, the animal undergoes autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Antiretroviral therapy is interrupted a month after engraftment has taken place. Although hematopoietic stem cells from man before infection with HIV are unlikely to be available, a successful test on the animal would suggest a new approach which could allow the cure of HIV in future."
3476,0.002,2.0000,"Enfuvirtide (ENF) prevents the entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) into cells by binding to the HR-1 region of the viral envelope (Env) protein gp41 subunit. Resistance to ENF arises via mutations in the drug binding site in HR-1. In addition, HR-2 mutations are commonly observed in ENF-resistant Env proteins, though their role remains unclear. We explored the mechanistic basis for clinical resistance to ENF and the role of HR-2 mutations. Using panels of ENF resistance-associated mutants for two patients, we found that mutations in HR-1 slowed the fusion kinetics and that mutations in HR-2 restored fusion rates. We assessed the differences in the rates of fusion of these mutants from a temperature-arrested state and observed similar trends, suggesting that the step of delay occurs after coreceptor engagement. Sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies was unchanged by the HR-1 and HR-2 mutants in each panel. Since this result was in contrast to those of a previous in vitro analysis where enhanced sensitivity to neutralization was demonstrated for heterologous Envs with ENF resistance-associated HR-1 changes, we examined the context dependence of HR-1 and HR-2 mutations by transferring the mutations seen in one patient into the Env context of another. These studies revealed that some, but not all, HR-1 mutations, when placed out of context (i.e., in a patient Env where they did not originally arise), enhance sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. However, in most cases, HR-1 mutations in ENF-treated patients evolve in a manner that preserves pretreatment neutralization sensitivity so as to evade the pressures of the immune system."
2340,0.002,2.0000,"The ability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to prevent the onset of HIV-associated dementia and to prevent or reduce the neuropathological features of HIV encephalitis (HIVE) remains unclear. Using a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model of HIVE, we determined the effects of regular HAART treatment on HIVE. Before studying HAART in infected SCID mice, nonmanipulated SCID mice were treated with a single injection of the HAART cocktail (consisting of zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir) to determine optimum dosage and sampling time and to measure antiretroviral levels in the brain. After these preliminary studies, SCID mice that were inoculated with either HIV-infected or uninfected human monocytes were given intraperitoneal (IP) injections of HAART three times daily over a 1- and 2-week period. All three drugs were detected in the brain using a novel drug extraction technique and a modified high-performance liquid chromatography method. HAART significantly decreased the amount of astrogliosis and viral load in treated mice compared with mice that received vehicle injections. These studies offer insight into the ability of HAART to treat HIV infection of the brain."
7942,0.002,2.0000,"Apoptosis has been indicated as a mechanism of T cell depletion in HIV-infected subjects and useful in monitoring disease progression. We investigated for the presence of apoptotic T lymphocytes in 130 HIV subjects in various stages of disease by the newly developed cell permeant DNA dye Apostain. Blood was collected in EDTA, lysed in buffered ammonium chloride, fixed in freshly prepared 1% paraformaldehyde and stored in aliquots at -80 degrees C. Samples were thawed and double stained with FITC conjugated-CD3 monoclonal antibody and Apostain. Flow cytometry was then performed and T cells gated on a CD3 versus side scatter dot plot. Normal samples treated in the same manner served to establish the boundary separating non-apoptotic from apoptotic cells. There was no statistically significant association between the proportion of subjects with detectable apoptotic cells and CDC clinical categories A, B and C at the time of admission to the study, although a trend toward a lower apoptotic rate in category A (A= 29%, B=40% and C=41%) was noticed. Conversely, CDC T cell categories 2 and 3 contained significantly higher proportions of Apostain positive patients (1=6%, 2=32% and 3=49%, P=0.072, by chi(2) test). Most importantly, Apostain test identified subjects at risk of disease progression during a 3.5-7 months follow-up in CDC category B and 2 (P=0.008 and P=0.0003, by Fisher's exact test, respectively). A similar, albeit not statistically significant trend was observed also in the other categories. Not requiring extensive manipulation of fresh samples nor cumbersome culture techniques, Apostain test appears suitable for identifying HIV subjects at higher risk of disease progression in clinical settings."
5929,0.002,2.0000,"The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and attitudes towards HIV/AIDS of nursing students in Turkey. HIV/AIDS has become one of the most serious health problems in the world. It is important to understand nursing students' knowledge and attitudes towards people living with HIV (PLHIV) because the educational preparation of nurses has been known to affect the attitudes of the nurse and the effectiveness of the care provided to PLHIV. The study was conducted with 227 nursing students from the School of Health in Antalya, Turkey during the calendar year 2005/2006. Qualitative and quantitative methods were both used to collect data for the study. Analysis of variance, t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis and inductive methods were used in data analysis. The majority of nursing students in this study had a moderate level of HIV/AIDS knowledge. Students correctly answered 64.4% of HIV/AIDS-related questions in the questionnaire (Mean 28.99; SD 7.03 out of 45 points). Scores increased parallel with student grade (F=26.925; p=0.000) and age (chi2 (K-W)=35.117; p=0.000). Fear of being infected and feelings of pity and empathy were the feelings most commonly indicated by the students. Students who had previous experience in caring for an AIDS patient and had known someone with HIV/AIDS were willing to care for PLHIV. Results underline the need to strengthen education on all aspects of HIV/AIDS. To improve nursing students willingness to care for PLHIV, particular emphasis should be placed on the training of nursing students as skilled nursing staff with humane attitudes towards PLHIV."
648,0.002,2.0000,"Combinations of two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus a third agent represent the current standard for antiretroviral therapy. Stavudine is a nucleoside analogue that demonstrates in vitro activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 within an acceptable therapeutic index in a range of T lymphocyte and haematopoietic precursor cell lines. It is additive or synergistic in vitro with a number of other antiretrovirals including protease inhibitors in two and three way combinations and is active against zidovudine-resistant virus. It exhibits excellent oral bioavailability, with CSF penetration. In clinical use, stavudine exhibits antiretroviral activity as a monotherapy similar to zidovudine, and is of proven clinical benefit in zidovudine-pretreated patients. In combination with didanosine and/or nelfinavir it results in more substantial and durable responses in immunological and virological markers than reported with either drug alone. Comparative trials in zidovudine-experienced patients suggest a similar frequency of adverse events to that observed with zidovudine. Peripheral neuropathy is the most common dose-limiting toxicity with haematological and hepatic function disturbance being infrequent. Reasons for stavudine failure are not established, with no consistent genotypic pattern being associated with changes in stavudine sensitivity in vitro or in vivo. The role of stavudine is as a component of triple therapy regimens both in initial therapy and in patients with prior zidovudine experience."
3012,0.002,2.0000,"Obesity and chronic, treated HIV infection are both associated with persistent systemic inflammation and a similar constellation of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, but the combined effects of excess adiposity and HIV on circulating proinflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers previously shown to predict disease risk is not well described. We measured inflammation biomarker levels in 158 predominantly virologically suppressed adults on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a range of body mass index (BMI) values from normal to morbidly obese. We assessed the relationship between BMI and each biomarker using multivariable linear regression adjusted for age, sex, race, CD4(+) count, tobacco use, data source, protease inhibitor use, and routine nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) or aspirin use. Among normal-weight (n=48) and overweight participants (n=41; BMI <30 kg/m(2)), incremental BMI increases were associated with significantly higher serum highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP; β=2.47, p=0.02) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α receptor 1 levels (β=1.53, p=0.03), and significantly lower CD14 levels (β=0.84, p=0.01), but similar associations were not observed in the obese participants. Among the obese (n=69; BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)), however, higher serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6; β=1.30, p=0.02) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (β=1.77, p<0.01) were associated with higher BMI, a finding not observed among the nonobese. Among all participants, IL-6 and TNF-α receptor 1 levels were most closely associated with hsCRP (p<0.01). Further studies are needed to determine whether higher serum inflammation biomarker levels found in obese HIV-infected individuals on ART reflect an increased likelihood of adverse health outcomes, or if novel markers to estimate mortality and disease risk are needed in this population."
2041,0.002,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is overall recognised in 10% of HIV+ persons worldwide, with large differences according to geographical region. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects 25% of HIV+ individuals, with greater rates ( approximately 75%) in intravenous drug users and persons infected through contaminated blood or blood products. HIV-hepatitis co-infected individuals show an accelerated course of liver disease, with faster progression to cirrhosis. The number of anti-HBV drugs has increased in the last few years, and some agents (e.g. lamivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir) also exert significant activity against HIV. Emergence of drug resistance challenges the long-term benefit of anti-HBV monotherapy, mainly with lamivudine. The results using new more potent anti-HBV drugs (e.g. tenofovir) are very promising, with prospects for stopping or even revert HBV-related liver damage in most cases. With respect to chronic hepatitis C, the combination of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin given for 1 year permits to achieve sustained HCV clearance in no more than 40% of HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Thus, new direct anti-HCV drugs are eagerly awaited for this population. Although being a minority, HIV+ patients with delta hepatitis and those with multiple hepatitis show the worst prognosis. Appropriate diagnosis and monitoring of chronic viral hepatitis, including the use of non-invasive tools for assessing liver fibrosis and measurement of viral load, may allow to confront adequately chronic viral hepatitis in HIV+ patients, preventing the development of end-stage liver disease, for which the only option available is liver transplantation. This article forms part of a special issue of Antiviral Research marking the 25th anniversary of antiretroviral drug discovery and development, Vol 85, issue 1, 2010."
7566,0.002,2.0000,"Expression of HLA-B57 is associated with restricted replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the mechanism for its protective effect remains unknown. If this advantage depends upon CD8 T-cell recognition of B57-restricted epitopes, mother-to-child transmission of escape mutations within these epitopes could nullify its protective effect. However, if the B57 advantage is largely mediated by selection for fitness-attenuating viral mutations within B57-restricted epitopes, such as T242N in TW10-Gag, then the transmission of such mutations could facilitate viral control in the haploidentical infant. We assessed the consequences of B57-associated mutations on replication capacity, viral control, and clinical outcome after vertical transmission in 13 mother-child pairs. We found that expression of HLA-B57 was associated with exceptional control of HIV during infancy, even when mutations within TW10 and most other B57-restricted epitopes were transmitted, subverting the natural immunodominance of HLA-B57. In contrast, most B57-negative infants born to B57-positive mothers progressed rapidly to AIDS. The presence of T242N led to a reproducible reduction in viral fitness, as demonstrated by in vitro assays using NL4-3 constructs encoding p24 sequences from individual mothers and infants. Associated compensatory mutations within p24-Gag were observed to reverse this impairment and to influence the propensity of T242N to revert after transmission to B57-negative hosts. Moreover, primary failure to control viremia was observed in one infant to whom multiple compensatory mutations were transmitted along with T242N. These parallel in vivo and in vitro data suggest that HLA-B57 confers its advantage primarily by driving and maintaining a fitness-attenuating mutation in p24-Gag."
5086,0.002,2.0000,"Conceptually, blocking human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration is the last possibility for preventing irreversible cellular infection. Using cocultures of monocyte-derived dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cells, which represent primary targets in sexual transmission, we demonstrated that blocking integration with integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs), particularly L-870812, could consistently block cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 infection. In a pretreatment setting in which the compound was present before and during infection and was afterwards gradually diluted during the culture period, the naphthyridine carboxamide L-870812 blocked infection with the cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 Ba-L strain at concentrations of, respectively, 1,000 and 10,000 nM. The potency of L-870812 was similar to that of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor R-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl) adenine (PMPA) but one or two orders of magnitude lower than those of the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors UC781 and TMC120. In contrast, the diketo acid RDS derivative InSTIs showed clear-cut but weaker antiviral activity than L-870812. Moreover, L-870812 completely blocked subtype C and CRFO2_AG primary isolates, which are prevalent in the African heterosexual epidemic. Furthermore, the addition of micromolar concentrations of L-870812 even 24 h after infection could still block both cell-free and cell-associated Ba-L, opening the prospect of postexposure prophylaxis. Finally, an evaluation of the combined activity of L-870812 with either T20, zidovudine, PMPA, UC781, or TMC120 against replication-deficient HIV-1 Ba-L (env) pseudovirus suggested synergistic activity for all combinations. Importantly, compounds selected for the study by using the coculture model were devoid of acute or delayed cytotoxic effects at HIV-blocking concentrations. Therefore, these findings provide evidence supporting consideration of HIV-1 integration as a target for microbicide development."
5026,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is still the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis world wide. Recently, however, there has been quite dramatic improvement in the understanding of HBV associated liver disease and its treatment. It has become clear that high viral replication is a major risk factor for the development of both cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Early studies have shown lamivudine lowers the risk of HBV associated complications. There are currently three nucleos(t)ides licensed, in addition to interferon, and there are more drugs coming to the market soon. Interferon or its pegylated counterpart are still the only options for treatment with defined end points, while nucleos(t)ides therapy is used mostly for long term treatment. Combination therapies have not been shown to be superior to monotherapy in naive patients, however, the outcome depends on how the end point is defined. Interferon plus lamivudine achieves a higher viral suppression than either treatment alone, even though Hbe-seroconversion was not different after a one year treatment. HBV-genotypes emerge as relevant factors, with genotypes ""A"" and ""B"" responding relatively well to interferon, achieving up to 20% HBsAg clearance in the case of genotype ""A"". In addition to having a defined treatment duration, interferon has the advantage of lacking resistance selection, which is a major drawback for lamivudine and the other nucleos(t)ides. The emergence of resistance against adefovir and entecavir is somewhat slower in naive compared to lamivudine resistant patients. Adefovir has a low resistance profile with 3%, 9%, 18%, and 28% after 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, while entecavir has rarely produced resistance in naive patients for up to 3 years."
7572,0.002,2.0000,"Psychiatric disorders are common among people living with HIV in Nigeria. Adherence is necessary to optimise the outcome of antiretroviral therapy. In this study, we aimed to identify associations between antiretroviral adherence, measured by one-week and one-month self-reported missed doses, and psychiatric illness in a cohort previously assessed for psychiatric disorders using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The study participants comprised 151 adults with major depression, anxiety or suicidal symptoms, and 302 matched-control participants. Two controls were randomly selected for each case within the same gender and education level. We compared participants with psychiatric disorders (WPDs) and no psychiatric disorders (NPDs) on selected demographic and clinical variables, in addition to adherence. Participants with one or more missed doses in the preceding month had twice the odds of having a major depressive episode as those with no missed doses during this period (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.03, 4.79). This association remained significant after adjusting for selected risk factors. There was no statistically significant difference between WPD and NPD groups on either one-week or one-month adherence, or on age, marital status, occupational class, HIV viral load at enrolment or current CD4 cell count. Among Nigerian adults with HIV, suboptimal antiretroviral adherence is associated with, and could be a sign of, depression. Routine self-report adherence assessments may potentially be utilised in identifying individuals at risk among this population."

Thus, 213 Caucasian adult HIV-infected patients were studied, 111 of whom had HCV-coinfection and 68 were HCV-monoinfected. Patients with ethanol consumption >50 g/day, hepatitis B coinfection, non-infective liver diseases or HAART adherence <75% were excluded. LF was assessed by transient elastometry (TE, Fibroscan). Serum levels of MMPs (MMP -1,-2,-3,-8,-9,-10 and -13) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP-1,-2 and -4) were measured by ELISA microarrays. Associations with LF were statistically analysed. Protease inhibitors, usually administered to patients with advanced LF were excluded from the analysis. Increased LF was significantly associated with d4T (P = 0.006) and didanosine (ddI) use (P = 0.007), months on d4T (P = 0.001) and on ARV (P = 0.025), duration of HIV (P < 0.0001) and HCV infections (P < 0.0001), higher HIV (P = 0.03) and HCV loads (P < 0.0001), presence of lipodystrophy (P = 0.02), male gender (P = 0.02), older age (P = 0.04), low nadir (P = 0.02) and current CD4(+) T-cells (P < 0.0001), low gain of CD4(+) T-cells after HAART (P = 0.01) and higher MMP-2 (P = 0.02) and TIMP-2 serum levels (P = 0.02). By logistic regression the only variables significantly associated with increased LF were: use of ddI (OR 8.77, 95% CI: 2.36-32.26; P = 0.005), male gender (OR 7.75, 95% CI: 2.33-25.64, P = 0.0008), HCV viral load (in log) (OR 3.53, 95% CI: 2.16-5.77; P < 0.0001) and age (in years) (OR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09-1.34, P = 0.0003). We conclude that only higher HCV viral load, older age, male gender, and use of ddI associated independently with increased LF in our study."
8456,0.002,2.0000,"High rates of mutation and recombination help human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to evade the immune system and develop resistance to antiretroviral therapy. Macrophages and T-cells are the natural target cells of HIV-1 infection. A consensus has not been reached as to whether HIV replication results in differential recombination between primary T-cells and macrophages. Here, we used HIV with silent mutation markers along with next generation sequencing to compare the mutation and the recombination rates of HIV directly in T lymphocytes and macrophages. We observed a more than four-fold higher recombination rate of HIV in macrophages compared to T-cells (p < 0.001) and demonstrated that this difference is not due to different reliance on C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) co-receptors between T-cells and macrophages. We also found that the pattern of recombination across the HIV genome (hot and cold spots) remains constant between T-cells and macrophages despite a three-fold increase in the overall recombination rate. This indicates that the difference in rates is a general feature of HIV DNA synthesis during macrophage infection. In contrast to HIV recombination, we found that T-cells have a 30% higher mutation rate than macrophages (p < 0.001) and that the mutational profile is similar between these cell types. Unexpectedly, we found no association between mutation and recombination in macrophages, in contrast to T-cells. Our data highlights some of the fundamental difference of HIV recombination and mutation amongst these two major target cells of infection. Understanding these differences will provide invaluable insights toward HIV evolution and how the virus evades immune surveillance and anti-retroviral therapeutics. "
8496,0.002,2.0000,"RNA interference (RNAi) was reported to block hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene expression and replication in vitro and in vivo. However, it remains a technical challenge for RNAi-based therapy to achieve long-term and complete inhibition effects in chronic HBV infection, which presumably requires more extensive and uniform transduction of the whole infected hepatocytes. To increase the in vivo transfection efficiency in liver, we used a double-stranded adeno-associated virus 8-pseudotyped vector (dsAAV2/8) to deliver shRNA. HBV transgenic mice were used as an animal model to evaluate the inhibition effects of the RNAi-based gene therapy. A single administration of dsAAV2/8 vector, carrying HBV-specific shRNA, effectively suppressed the steady level of HBV protein, mRNA and replicative DNA in liver of HBV transgenic mice, leading to up to 2-3 log(10) decrease in HBV load in the circulation. Significant HBV suppression sustained for at least 120 days after vector administration. The therapeutic effect of shRNA was target sequence dependent and did not involve activation of interferon. These results underscore the potential for developing RNAi-based therapy by dsAAV2/8 vector to treat HBV chronic infection, and possibly other persistent liver infections as well."

Therefore, we aim to elucidate the mutation patterns in the surface open reading frame (S ORF) underlying occult infections of HBV genotype C in the present study. Nested PCRs were applied to 624 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative Korean subjects. Cloning and sequencing of the S ORF gene was applied to 41 occult cases and 40 control chronic carriers. Forty-one (6.6%) of the 624 Korean adults with HBsAg-negative serostatus were found to be positive for DNA according to nested PCR tests. Mutation frequencies in the three regions labeled here as preS1, preS2, and S were significantly higher in the occult subjects compared to the carriers in all cases. A total of two types of deletions, preS1 deletions in the start codon and preS2 deletions as well as nine types of point mutations were significantly implicated in the occult infection cases. Mutations within the ""a"" determinant region in HBsAg were found more frequently in the occult subjects than in the carriers. Mutations leading to premature termination of S ORF were found in 16 occult subjects (39.0%) but only in one subject from among the carriers (2.5%). In conclusion, our data suggest that preS deletions, the premature termination of S ORF, and ""a"" determinant mutations are associated with occult infections of HBV genotype C among a HBsAg-negative population. The novel mutation patterns related to occult infection introduced in the present study can help to broaden our understanding of HBV occult infections."
3128,0.002,2.0000,"Integrase inhibitor (INI) is a novel antiretroviral drug recommended for both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients. Limited data are available on INI resistance in Thailand, where HIV-1 subtype A/E predominates. We aimed to investigate INI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) among treatment-naive patients and patients who experienced treatment failure with NNRTI-based or PI-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Thailand. One hundred and eight plasma samples of 58 treatment-naive and 50 treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected individuals were collected. The HIV-1 integrase coding region was sequenced. Polymorphisms were compared between subtype A/E and B circulating in Thailand and between treatment-naive and treatment-experienced groups. Resulting amino acids were interpreted for drug resistance according to Stanford algorithms. Ninety-seven samples were HIV-1 subtype A/E, 10 were subtype B, and one was subtype C. Age, gender, and CD4 cell counts were similar between treatment-naive and treatment-experienced groups, while the treatment-failure group showed a statistically significant longer awareness time of HIV-1 infection and lower viral load than the treatment-naive group. Major INI-RAM was not found in this study, but some minor INI-RAMs, such asV54I, L68I, L74M, T97A, and S230N, were found. Comparing INI-RAMs between subtype A/E and B, the prevalence of V54I and V72I was higher in subtype B than subtype E, while V201I was found in all sequences of subtype A/E. In subtype A/E, integrase polymorphisms were not different between treatment-naive and treatment-experienced groups. However, the number of amino acid substitutions was significantly higher in the treatment-experienced group (p=0.009). One NNRTI-based ART-treated patient was found to have potential low-level INI-RAMs. INI-RAMs are rare in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients in Thailand. This suggested that INI should be active in patients who are naive to INI in Thailand."
8266,0.002,2.0000,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important outcome measure among HIV-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), but has not been studied extensively in resource-limited settings. Insight in the predictors or correlates of poor HRQoL may be helpful to identify patients most in need of additional support and to design appropriate interventions. A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2012 and April 2013 in 10 healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Patients who were at least 6 months on cART were randomly selected and individual patient data were retrieved from medical records. HRQoL was measured by the WHOQoL-HIVBREF, depressive-symptoms by the Kessler-6 scale, and stigma by the Kalichman internalized AIDS-related stigma scale. Multivariate linear regression analysis was carried-out to examine associations between HRQoL and the other variables. A total of 664 patients (response-rate 95%) participated in the study. A higher level of depressive-symptoms was most strongly and consistently associated with a lower HRQoL, both in terms of the magnitude of the relationship and in the number of HRQoL domains associated with it. Also, a higher level of HIV-stigma was associated with a lower HRQoL except for the physical domain, while obtaining sufficient nutritious food and job opportunity were associated with a better HRQoL except for the spiritual and social domains, respectively. Demographics, clinical, and treatment characteristics yielded few significant associations with HRQoL. Our study findings suggest that interventions to improve HRQoL should focus on reducing depressive-symptoms and HIV-stigma, and on enhancing food security and job opportunity. "

Here, we examined the determinants of harboring this mutation and its rate of emergence in treated patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HBV. In a three-year prospective cohort of 165 HIV-HBV co-infected patients, pcW28* mutation was determined via DNA-chip during yearly sampling. In a subgroup with liver biopsies, HBV covalently-closed circular (ccc)-DNA and total intrahepatic (IH)-DNA were quantified by real-time PCR.

719,0.002,2.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is responsible for 4. 5% of AIDS cases in Portugal. Six HIV-2 subtypes have been described so far, subtype A being proposed as more pathogenic than the rest. The relationship between the clinical status and levels of both cellular and plasma HIV-2 viraemia is not well known, nor their modifications under antiretroviral therapy. Thirty-two consecutive HIV-2 infected persons (17 men, 15 women) attending two different hospitals in Lisbon in 1997 were enrolled prospectively in the study. All but 4 individuals most likely acquired the infection through heterosexual contact. More than half of the study population was of African origin, mainly from Guinea-Bissau. Eleven (34.4%) patients had developed clinical manifestations included within the B or C groups of the CDC classification system for HIV infection, with the rest being asymptomatic. Half of the population was undergoing antiretroviral treatment at the time of the study. HIV-2 subtypes were investigated using a new Nef-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method that allows differentiation of the main two variants, A and B. Plasma viral load was quantified using a new quantitative competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QcRT-PCR) procedure as well as the Amp-RT assay. Virus isolation was attempted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. All but one person carried HIV-2 subtype A. Plasma viraemia examined by QcRT-PCR was measurable in 15 (50%) of 30 subjects, yielding in all instances values below 20,000 HIV-2 RNA copies per ml. Plasma RT activity could be detected in only 10 (33%) of 30 subjects, a rate much lower than that seen in HIV-1 infection. Virus was isolated from 16 (53.3%) of 30 patients. A significant correlation was found between CD4+ counts, clinical status, rate of virus isolation, and plasma viral load by both QcRT-PCR and Amp-RT. In conclusion, HIV-2 subtype A is the predominant variant circulating in Portugal among both natives and immigrants. A lower cellular and plasma viral load with respect to HIV-1 was seen in persons without immunosuppression, from whom the rate of virus recovery was extremely low."
5014,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 drug-resistance testing is quickly moving from the research laboratory to the clinic as data defining its utility as a prognostic indicator of response to therapy become available. In July 1998, a panel of the International AIDS Society-USA did not recommend the widespread application of resistance testing, but by May 2000 this panel endorsed and recommended the incorporation of resistance testing in patient-care management. Considerable data supporting the use of drug-resistance testing have now been published or presented at international conferences. These data strongly suggest that drug-resistance testing is of considerable value in many clinical settings. Prospective trials of resistance testing as a clinical management tool are still ongoing, and the long-term benefits still need to be evaluated. Nevertheless, early results from several studies showed a significantly better virological response when treatment regimens were based on resistance-testing data, rather than on the standard of care. HIV drug-resistance testing is also useful as a tool for new antiretroviral drug design and development, as well as for monitoring the spread of primary HIV drug resistance."
3611,0.002,2.0000,"The recent description of chronic hepatitis E in organ transplant recipients deserves increased awareness in the context of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in immunocompromised individuals. Reported here is what is apparently the first PCR-documented case of acute hepatitis E in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected patient. The CD4(+) T-lymphocyte count was 246/mm(3). The IgM anti-HEV antibody and HEV RNA tests results from serum were positive. Hepatitis was benign, and chronic HEV infection was ruled out. The HEV genotype was 3f. The patient did not report recent travel abroad. HEV should be tested in HIV-infected individuals presenting with acute hepatitis. HEV RNA detection is useful in diagnosing HEV infection and in monitoring recovery."
8962,0.002,2.0000,"To clarify useful clinical parameters for determining the need for changes in antiretroviral regimens, 586 persons who were seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and who had intermediate-stage HIV disease underwent follow-up semiannually for a median of 3.1 years after zidovudine monotherapy was instituted. The strongest predictors of time to the development of AIDS and of survival were an increased CD4 lymphocyte count (> 50/microL), a decreased neopterin level (> 2.4 nmol/L), and no increase in the number of symptoms after 7-12 months of zidovudine therapy. Men who had the best quartile CD4 lymphocyte and neopterin responses and who also had no increase in the number of symptoms were 23 times less likely to die (reflecting a 96% increase in survival) than were men who had the worst responses in these variable categories. After 7-12 months of zidovudine therapy, 5-year survival rates were 63% for men with good responses in all three variable categories, 47%-49% for those with good CD4 lymphocyte responses and good responses in one other variable category, 31% for those with only a good CD4 lymphocyte response, and 0 for those with poor responses in all three variable categories."
6457,0.002,2.0000,"We have investigated the molecular diversity of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) among the HIV co-infected patients from eastern-India. HBsAg/HBV-DNA positive subjects (n=73) from 874 HIV-infected patients were analyzed by sequencing followed by genetic diversity quantification. HBV/genotype-D and HBV/sugenotype-D2 were predominant. HBV/D2 isolates from patients with low CD4 count manifested significantly lower non-synonymous substitutions (p<0.0001) and Shannon entropy (p=0.0006) in their surface and polymerase gene in comparison to those from moderately increased CD4 count. ART-induced immune-reconstitution therefore might raise non-synonymous immune/therapy escape substitutions among these HBV/D2 isolates. Decreased genetic diversity and increased viral load in the HBV/D2 isolates might facilitate the maintenance of their wild type characteristics in the low CD4 count, leading to its increased prevalence in this group. Interestingly, genetic diversity in HBV/A1, the next common subgenotype, was modified in the opposite manner. Together our results underscore the need for proper HBV molecular monitoring in HIV co-infection."
3183,0.002,2.0000,"In 2004, KwaZulu-Natal initiated one of the world's largest HIV/AIDS treatment programs. Studies in South Africa have shown that patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) develop rapidly and transmit drug resistant mutations. Since resistance testing is not widely available in Kwazulu-Natal, the Department of Health conducted the first HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) threshold survey in 2005, which did not identify any mutations associated with HIVDR. The objective of this study was to conduct a follow-up threshold survey to update the information on HIVDR. This study was conducted in 2009 in five antenatal care sites in Kwazulu-Natal using the HIVDR threshold survey method developed by WHO. Two hundred and thirteen newly-diagnosed HIV positive, drug-naïve primigravidae, less than 22 years of age were included in the survey. Of the 82 HIV positive specimens, 17 had insufficient volume for genotyping and, of the remaining 65, 47 were genotyped sequentially. Drug resistance was identified by sequencing the HIV-1 pol gene, using the ViroSeq® HIV-1 genotyping system v2.0. Of the 47 samples that were genotyped, only one presented with a K103N mutation, which equates to a prevalence of transmitted HIVDR of <5%. The low prevalence of transmitted HIVDR is in keeping with statistical models of the early stages of ART rollout. As ART coverage is increasing continuously, there is a need to ensure that vigilance of HIVDR continues so that the emergence and spread of HIVDR is minimized."
1455,0.002,2.0000,"With the advent of the combination antiretroviral therapy era (cART), the development of AIDS has been largely limited in the USA. Unfortunately, despite the development of efficacious treatments, HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) can still develop, and as many HIV-1 positive individuals age, the prevalence of HAND is likely to rise because HAND manifests in the brain with very low levels of virus. However, the mechanism producing this viral disorder is still debated. Interestingly, HIV-1 infection exposes neurons to proteins including Tat, Nef, and Vpr which can drastically alter mitochondrial properties. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been posited to be a cornerstone of the development of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we investigated mitochondria in an animal model of HAND. Using an HIV-1 transgenic rat model expressing seven of the nine HIV-1 viral proteins, mitochondrial functional and proteomic analysis were performed on a subset of mitochondria that are particularly sensitive to cellular changes, the neuronal synaptic mitochondria. Quantitative mass spectroscopic studies followed by statistical analysis revealed extensive proteome alteration in this model paralleling mitochondrial abnormalities identified in HIV-1 animal models and HIV-1-infected humans. Novel mitochondrial protein changes were discovered in the electron transport chain (ETC), the glycolytic pathways, mitochondrial trafficking proteins, and proteins involved in various energy pathways, and these findings correlated well with the function of the mitochondria as assessed by a mitochondrial coupling and flux assay. By targeting these proteins and proteins upstream in the same pathway, we may be able to limit the development of HAND."
8628,0.002,2.0000,"Many clinicians who care for patients with HIV infection are dissatisfied with the existing recommendations on antiretroviral therapy. Current practice focuses on the early suppression of viremia, yet the outcome of that approach may not be in the best interest of individual patients or populations. The major goal of HIV therapy is to maintain the long-term health of the patient while avoiding drug-related toxicity and preserving viable future treatment options. Recent studies have challenged the principles on which recommendations for early, aggressive treatment were based. Key studies that lead to licensure of antiretroviral medications usually involve short-term results in treatment-naive patients; it is difficult to apply these results to long-term management of therapy-experienced patients. Early, aggressive therapy often prematurely exposes patients to risks for medication-related side effects and resistance. A more cautious, patient-focused, long-term approach to therapy would help foster studies of alternate strategies, such as delayed initiation of therapy, protease-sparing therapy, class-sparing therapy, planned drug interruptions, switches in therapy, and immune-based therapy. It is time for clinicians to rethink their approach to the treatment of HIV infection."
7066,0.002,2.0000,"Viral sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a major health problem for women. Over many years the incidence of these infections has increased steadily to epidemic proportions. These infections not only cause short-term morbidity but also have been associated with significant long-term morbidity and mortality. This paper focuses on two of the most common viral STDs-Genital Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection of the female. The steady increase in the incidence of HIV infection and subsequent adult immunodeficiency disease (AIDS) among women requires health care providers to assume an active role in detection and treatment in order to avoid transmission, to protect the health of women with HIV/AIDS, and to reduce the risk of maternal-fetal (vertical) transmission. Because treatment with zidovudine has been shown to reduce vertical transmission, routine offering of HIV testing is currently recommended for all pregnant women. The approach to testing nonpregnant patients, i.e., the choice between selective screening or routine testing, rests with the individual clinician. Testing large numbers of patients within a practice may be facilitated by the availability of an oral antibody testing system. The sensitivity and specificity of the oral test is equivalent to blood testing. Serum and oral specimens are tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and confirmatory Western blot assays specifically designed for use with oral samples. Controversies in diagnosis as well as the most updated treatments for these infections are discussed."
1190,0.002,2.0000,"Physical activity (PA) can improve cardiorespiratory status, strength, body composition and quality of life for patients infected with HIV. Evidence from HIV-uninfected populations also shows that PA is associated with a lower risk of mortality, primarily death due to cardiovascular causes. There is, however, a lack of data on how physically active HIV-infected patients are. In this study, we assessed levels of self-reported PA over time in patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, a large multicentre prospective observational cohort study. We included a total of 10,540 patients who completed at least one report of PA between December 2009 and November 2014 during routine clinical follow-up (scheduled every 6 months). In the first year after December 2009 there was a higher rate of non-response so these data are of a lesser reliability. Over the next four years, the percentage of patients reporting no free-time PA at all declined from 49% to 44%. In contrast, in two ""Sport Switzerland"" surveys of the general population in 2008 and 2014, the percentage of individuals reporting no sports activities at all was considerably lower and relatively stable over time (27% in 2008; 26% in 2014). In our analysis, the percentage of patients reporting sedentary activity at work increased from 23% to 26% over the four years. Subgroup findings suggest differences between women and men and between patients classified by their age, stage of infection and CD4 cell count. Integrating PA counselling into the routine care of HIV-infected patients and promoting PA among this population has the potential to improve the general state of health and quality of life for HIV-infected patients and reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease."
3718,0.002,2.0000,"Phylogenetic analysis was used to study in vivo genetic variation of the V3 region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in relation to disease progression in six infants with vertically acquired human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. Nucleotide sequences from each infant formed a monophyletic group with similar average branch lengths separating the sets of sequences. In contrast to the star-shaped phylogeny characteristic of interinfant viral evolution, the shape of the phylogeny formed by sequences from the infants who developed AIDS tended to be linear. A computer program, DISTRATE, was written to analyze changes in DNA distance values over time. For the six infants, the rate of divergence from the initial variant was inversely correlated with CD4 cell counts averaged over the first 11 to 15 months of life (r = -0.87, P = 0.024). To uncover evolutionary relationships that might be dictated by protein structure and function, tree-building methods were applied to inferred amino acid sequences. Trees constructed from the full-length protein fragment (92 amino acids) showed that viruses from each infant formed a monophyletic group. Unexpectedly, V3 loop protein sequences (35 amino acids) that were found at later time points from the two infants who developed AIDS clustered together. Furthermore, these sequences uniquely shared amino acids that have been shown to confer a T-cell line tropic phenotype. The evolutionary pattern suggests that viruses from these infants with AIDS acquired similar and possibly more virulent phenotypes."

The aim of this study presents the most extensive HIV-1 molecular epidemiology investigation in Hebei province in China thus far. We have carried out the most extensive systematic cross-sectional study based on newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive individuals in 2013, and characterized the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequences in the whole of Hebei. Nine HIV-1 genotypes based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequence were identified among 610 newly diagnosed naïve individuals. The four main genotypes were circulating recombinant form (CRF)01_AE (53.4%), CRF07_BC (23.4%), subtype B (15.9%), and unique recombinant forms URFs (4.9%). Within 1 year, three new genotypes (subtype A1, CRF55_01B, CRF65_cpx), unknown before in Hebei, were first found among men who have sex with men (MSM). All nine genotypes were identified in the sexually contracted HIV-1 population. Among 30 URFs, six recombinant patterns were revealed, including CRF01_AE/BC (40.0%), CRF01_AE/B (23.3%), B/C (16.7%), CRF01_AE/C (13.3%), CRF01_AE/B/A2 (3.3%) and CRF01_AE/BC/A2 (3.3%), plus two potential CRFs. This study elucidated the complicated characteristics of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology in a low HIV-1 prevalence northern province of China and revealed the high level of HIV-1 genetic diversity. All nine HIV-1 genotypes circulating in Hebei have spread out of their initial risk groups into the general population through sexual contact, especially through MSM. This highlights the urgency of HIV prevention and control in China."
7413,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection influences natural killer (NK) cell expression of inhibitory NK receptors and activating natural cytotoxicity receptors. It is unknown whether expression of the co-stimulatory NK cell receptor 2B4 (CD244) on NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells are affected by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), low-level viraemia, proviral-DNA or immune activation in HIV-1 infected patients. A total of 101 HAART-treated HIV-1 infected patients with < or = 200 HIV-RNA copies/ml were followed prospectively for 24 months. HIV-RNA was investigated 3-monthly and 2B4 expression on CD3- CD16+ NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells, proviral-DNA and plasma soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor (sTNFr)-II were investigated 6-monthly. For comparison, 2B4 expression was investigated in 20 healthy individuals. The concentration of 2B4+ NK cells was initially reduced in HIV-1 infected patients (P < 0.001) but increased to a normal level during the 24 months' follow-up. The concentration of CD3+ CD8+ 2B4+ cells in HIV-1 infected patients was normal and did not change during follow-up. The relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of 2B4 increased on both NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells during follow-up (both P < 0.001). Higher levels of proviral-DNA carrying cells and plasma sTNFrII were associated with reductions in the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells (all P < 0.05). HIV-RNA had no effect on 2B4 expression on NK cells or CD3+ CD8+ cells. These findings demonstrate that the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells normalizes during long-term HAART in HIV-1 infected patients. The finding that proviral-DNA and sTNFrII were associated negatively with the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells suggests that immune activation in HIV-1 infected patients receiving HAART influences the target cell recognition by NK cells."
1509,0.002,2.0000,"Several recent studies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients have identified micronutrient deficiencies as affecting progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and death. Although the mechanisms are not known, micronutrient deficiencies may exacerbate the oxidative stress induced by HIV. In addition, infection and its evolution likely lead to an increased requirement for nutritional micronutrients, especially antioxidants. To evaluate this, 40 relatively healthy, institutionalized HIV-infected individuals were recruited for assessment before or three months after fresh fruit and vegetable supply were increased due to seasonal supply. Seven-day dietary records were recorded at the beginning (December) and end of the three-month study period (March). Oxidative stress indices and CD4+, CD38+/CD8+, and CD95+ T-lymphocyte subsets were also measured at these times. No significant differences were found in calorie or protein intake across the study period, but vitamin A, C, and E intakes all increased. A number of redox indicators were modified (increase: total antioxidant status, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione; and decrease: superoxide dismutase) during the study period. However, no change in malondialdehyde, hydroperoxides, or DNA damage was noted but a significant reduction in CD38+/CD8+ relative count was seen. Within the context and limitations of this study, the increase of dietary fruits and vegetables intake for three months had some beneficial effects on nutrition, systemic redox balance, and immune parameters in HIV-infected persons."
8220,0.002,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are leading causes of death from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States. Because underreporting has complicated the understanding of disease burden, in 2010 the Institute of Medicine requested that CDC perform a comprehensive evaluation of national viral hepatitis surveillance. Hepatitis surveillance data rely on local and state estimates, and a better understanding of reporting at these levels can inform strategies to improve national data quality. As an initial assessment, CDC partnered with the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) and an urban health-care system in southeastern Michigan to evaluate the completeness of reporting (including case status, demographic, and risk factor information) of cases of chronic HBV and HCV infection among persons who were enrolled in a multicenter chronic hepatitis cohort study to the MDCH viral hepatitis registry. This report summarizes the results of that assessment. Among clinically confirmed chronic hepatitis infections, 82% of HBV infections and 65% of HCV infections were reported. Completeness of reporting of chronic HBV and HCV infections was significantly improved for those with more recent clinical diagnoses, but reporting still remained incomplete. The completeness of reporting varied significantly by demographic characteristics of patients with HCV infection. Few reports of either HBV or HCV infection included risk factors. Improving surveillance of chronic hepatitis in Michigan will require exploration of more efficient methods for the transfer of laboratory and clinical data and evaluation of the most appropriate sources for risk factor information to aid in the prevention of viral hepatitis transmission. Similar collaborations with health-care institutions that use electronic International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes and laboratory data can provide local and state health departments with insight into the challenges to case reporting in their jurisdictions."
9226,0.002,2.0000,"A heterosexual partner study was carried out in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from August 1990 to December 1991. The main objectives were to determine the rate of male-to-female transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and to determine risk factors. Male index cases were recruited according to the following criteria: 1) confirmed HIV positivity, 2) 18 years old or older; 3) heterosexual contact within the past year. Only female partners who reported not to have other risk factors but to have had sexual contact with the index case were invited to participate. Couples were interviewed for risk factors and had blood collected for laboratory studies. The overall prevalence of HIV infection was 45 percent among 204 female partners in the study. Using logistic regression, the authors found the following factors to be independently (p < 0.05) associated with HIV infection: 1) anal sex (odds ratio (OR) = 3.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.87-7.45); 2) condom use during vaginal sex sometimes (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.07-1.96), rarely (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.15-3.83), or never (OR = 3.04, 95% CI 1.23-7.50) as compared with always; 3) frequency of sexual contacts in the year prior to interview (100+) (OR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.03-3.91); and 4) oral contraceptive use (OR = 2.04, 95% CI 0.97-4.29). In addition to a borderline significance of oral contraceptive use, there was a strong suggestion of an interaction with history of sexually transmitted diseases."

Causes (including HIV symptoms, quality of life, depression, herbal treatment and alcohol use) for discontinuing ART follow-up in predominantly rural resource-limited settings are not well understood. This is a prospective study of the treatment-naïve patients recruited from three (one urban, one-semi-urban and one rural) public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal from October 2007 to February 2008. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of loss to follow-up or all caused attrition from an ART programme within a cohort followed up for over 12 months. A total of 735 patients (217 men and 518 women) prior to initiating ART completed a baseline questionnaire and 6- and 12-months' follow-up. At 12-months follow-up 557 (75.9%) individuals continued active ART, 177 (24.1%) were all cause attrition, there were 82 deaths (13.8%), 58 (7.9%) transfers, 7 (1.0%) refused participation, 8 (1.1%) were not yet on ART and 22 (3.0%) could not be traced. Death by 12-months of follow-up was associated with lower CD4 cell counts (risk ratio, RR=2.05, confidence intervals, CI=1.20-3.49) and higher depression levels (RR=1.05, CI=1.01-1.09) at baseline assessment. The high early mortality rates indicate that patients are enrolling into ART programmes with far too advanced immunodeficiency; median CD4 cell counts 119 (IQR=59-163). Causes of late access to the ART programme, such as delays in health care access (delayed health care seeking), health system delays, or inappropriate treatment criteria, need to be addressed. Differences in health status (lower CD4 cell counts and higher depression scores) should be taken into account when initiating patients on ART. Treating depression at ART initiation is recommended to improve treatment outcome."

From 1993 to 1995, a total of 871 HIV-infected women and 439 demographically matched, uninfected women aged 16-55 years, half of whom reported injection drug use and half of whom reported only sexual risk behaviors, were recruited in four US cities. Two sites recruited primarily from medical/drug therapy care settings, and two recruited from community sources. Women consented to biannual interviews; physical examination; blood, urine, and cervicovaginal specimen collection and repository; laboratory assays; and abstraction of outpatient and inpatient medical records to document HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related diagnoses. Retention was greater than 88% at the third 6-month follow-up. Lower retention was associated with currently injecting drugs, not having dependent children, and not being infected with HIV at enrollment. In addition to the core study, a variety of nested studies are under way, some in collaboration with other HIV cohorts and various Public Health Service agencies. This cohort is distinct from other HIV longitudinal cohorts in the diversity of its participants and the comprehensive range of measures to study prospectively the biomedical, social, and emotional effects of the HIV epidemic on infected women and those whose behavior puts them at high risk of infection."

Antibodies against R7V peptide have the property of neutralizing all strains of HIV, unrelated to genotype, phenotype, or geographical origin of the virus, even in the presence of anti-retroviral drug resistance. Patients that mount an anti-R7V antibody response have been shown to be slow or non-progressors and this epitope has been considered for vaccine and/or therapeutic uses. In this study, HIV-infected patients under highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, were evaluated for the presence of anti-R7V antibodies. Thirty-three HIV positive patients and 10 healthy controls were enrolled to the study. For HIV-infected patients, determination of viral load and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts were performed by a commercial real-time PCR assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Anti-R7V antibodies were detected from serum samples by a commercial ELISA (Anti-R7V ELISA, Ivagen, France) test. Three HIV infected patients (3/33, 9.1%) displayed anti-R7V antibodies whereas the remaining 30 (90.9%) patients and all controls were interpreted as negative. No statistically significant difference was detected for HIV-RNA levels and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts between anti-R7V positive and negative patients (p= 0.871 and p= 0.287, respectively). These results indicate the presence of anti-R7V antibodies in our study population with HIV infection. No correlation with the presence of anti-R7V and disease progression were displayed in this study. Clinical impact of anti-R7V antibody assays for the management of HIV-infected patients will be revealed in the near future with the help of advanced studies."
5930,0.002,2.0000,"Early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to a decreased morbidity and mortality. General practice offers an important window for earlier diagnosis. The British HIV Association produced guidelines in 2008 advocating an increase in HIV testing, with specific references to primary care. This study explores the awareness of, and opinions towards, these guidelines within general practice. An email questionnaire was sent to 191 general practitioners nationwide, in both areas of high and low HIV prevalence. A total of 80 doctors replied, giving a response rate of 42%. In all, 44% of the respondents were unaware of the guidelines and 89% felt comfortable discussing and carrying out an HIV test themselves; of the 11% that did not, all but one were from low prevalence areas (P = 0.037). Respondents felt that main barrier to HIV testing was patient acceptability. Having read the guidelines, 70% believed it would be feasible to follow them in practice. Those who disagreed felt that time implications were the most important reason not to adopt the guidelines. Almost half the respondents were not aware of the guidelines; having read them, the majority felt that implementation is feasible. This demonstrates the necessity for better dissemination of these guidelines. This study found that the main barrier to performing an HIV test was felt to be patient acceptance, a contradiction to findings from recent pilot studies."
958,0.002,2.0000,"A 1-year prospective analysis of patient adherence to antiretroviral therapy (zidovudine plus zalcitabine [55 patients] or zidovudine plus zalcitabine plus saquinavir [32 patients]) was performed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients attended at a tertiary care hospital. Adherence to therapy was measured jointly by pharmacy records, patients' self-recording, and an increase in mean corpuscular volume. Likewise, the effects of therapy on clinical parameters, HIV load, CD4+ cell count, and serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and its soluble receptors were analyzed. Twenty-seven patients of those on a double-agent regimen and 12 of those on a triple-agent regimen adhered to the treatment. Ten opportunistic events occurred in noncompliant patients versus none in compliant individuals. A significant increase in CD4+ cell count and a decrease in HIV viral load were observed only in patients who adhered to therapy. TNF and its soluble receptors remained elevated at the end of follow-up, even in patients in whom the HIV viral load decreased to < 400 copies/ml. In conclusion, adherence to therapy must be considered a major factor influencing the results of antiretroviral therapy. Although these treatments have been demonstrated to be efficacious, they are not able to normalize the immune activation markers. These data suggest a suboptimal effect of antiretroviral therapy on the eradication of HIV-1."
1051,0.002,2.0000,"A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient in 2007 has the option to commence an antiretroviral regimen that is extremely efficacious in suppressing the virus and has few side effects. In a recent study, we estimated the median remaining lifetime of a newly diagnosed 25-year-old HIV-infected individual to be 39 years. The prospect of a near-normal life expectancy has implications for the HIV-infected persons as well as for the handling of the disease in the healthcare system. The patients can now on a long-term perspective plan their professional career, join a pension plan and start a family. Further, they may expect to be treated equally with other members of society with respect to access to mortgage, health insurance and life insurance. As the infected population ages, more patients will contract age-related diseases, and the disease burden on some individuals may even come to be dominated by non-HIV-related conditions that may have a worse prognosis and therefore become more important than HIV-related conditions. Despite the improvements in antiretroviral therapy, there is still an excess mortality among HIV patients, which appears to be only partially attributable to immunodeficiency, with lifestyle factors potentially playing a pronounced role. Consequently, an effort to further increase survival must target risk factors for both HIV-related and -unrelated mortality. The continuation of the positive trend may be achieved by increased HIV testing, earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy, improved drug adherence, prevention and treatment of HIV-unrelated co-morbidity and collaboration with other medical specialists to treat an ageing co-morbidity-acquiring HIV population."
6349,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), formerly termed human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLVIII/LAV), is the etiological agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Direct detection of HIV-1 nucleic acid sequences in patient tissue or blood samples is possible in only a minor fraction of cases due to the low percentage of infected cells (Shaw et al., 1984). We report a modification of the polymerase chain reaction method (PCR) (Saiki et al., 1985), in which we amplify sequences from HIV-1 RNA templates, for the identification of HIV-1 in peripheral blood and tissue samples obtained from AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC) patients. This method of HIV-1 detection is at least six orders of magnitude more sensitive than standard nucleic acid detection methods and has direct clinical applications. In vitro tissue culturing of the virus is not required for HIV-1 detection. Using this technique, the sequence in the orfB region of HIV-1 has been amplified and detected from less than 1 microgram of total RNA prepared from a few milliliters of peripheral blood samples. This technique enables the rapid and unambiguous clinical detection of potential HIV-infected individuals and can be used to assay the efficacy of anti-HIV-1 drugs. To enhance the efficiency of this technique, we have appended the prokaryotic T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence to one of the priming oligonucleotides. After several cycles of PCR with the promoter-containing oligo, a small aliquot of the reaction can be utilized to direct specific and efficient T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription of the amplified sequences, thus enhancing the sensitivity and simplifying the labor of the experiment."
9205,0.002,2.0000,"This paper examines factors associated with adherence to antiretroviral medications (ARVs) in an HIV-infected population at high risk for non-adherence: individuals living with psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. Data were examined from baseline interviews of a multisite cohort intervention study of 1138 HIV-infected adults with both a psychiatric and substance abuse disorder (based on a structured psychiatric research interview using DSM-IV criteria). The baseline interview documented mental illness and substance use in the past year, mental illness and substance abuse severity, demographics, service utilization in the past three months, general health and HIV-related conditions, self-reported spirituality and self-reported ARV medication use. Among the participants, 62% were prescribed ARVs at baseline (n = 542) and 45% of those on ARVs reported skipping medications in the past three days. Reports of non-adherence were significantly associated with having a detectable viral load (p<.01). The factors associated with non-adherence were current drug and alcohol abuse, increased psychological distress, less attendance at medical appointments, non-adherence to psychiatric medications and lower self-reported spirituality. Increased psychological distress was significantly associated with non-adherence, independent of substance abuse (p<.05). The data suggest that both mental illness and substance use must be addressed in HIV-infected adults living with these co-morbid illnesses to improve adherence to ARVs."
596,0.002,2.0000,"Little information exists on the frequency, severity, and timing of first-line anti-tuberculosis drug-related adverse events (TB-AEs) in HIV-tuberculosis coinfected (HIV-TB) patients in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. This matched-cohort study included HIV-TB patients as cases and HIV-uninfected tuberculosis (non-HIV-TB) patients as controls. Tuberculosis was culture-confirmed in both groups. Cases were matched to controls in a 1:4 ratio on age, sex, and year of diagnosis. TB-AEs were defined as Grade 2 or higher requiring drug discontinuation/regimen change. From 2003 to 2015, 94 cases and 376 controls were analyzed (95% men, 98% Asians). Standard four-drug combination therapy was initiated in 91% of cases and 89% of controls (p = 0.45). Cases had a higher frequency of TB-AE [51% (48/94) vs. 10% (39/376), p < 0.001]. Their major TB-AEs were fever (19%), rash (11%), and neutropenia (11%). TB-AEs were more severe in cases [Grade 3 or higher: cases (71%, 34/48) vs. controls (49%, 19/39), p < 0.001]. The time from treatment initiation to TB-AE was shorter in cases [median 18 (interquartile range 12-28) vs. 27 (15-57) days, p = 0.027], and 73% of TB-AEs in cases occurred within 4 weeks of starting anti-tuberculosis treatment. HIV infection was an independent risk factor for TB-AEs in the multivariate Cox analysis [adjusted HR (aHR): 6.96; 95% confidence interval: 3.93-12.3]. TB-AEs occurred more frequently in HIV-TB than in non-HIV-TB patients, and were more severe. The majority of TB-AEs occurred within 4 weeks of initiating anti-tuberculosis treatment. Because TB-AEs may delay ART initiation, careful monitoring during this period is warranted in coinfected patients."
6193,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants may either emerge in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) as a result of positive selection pressure exerted by their own immune response, or during therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). Naturally occurring HBV variants with primary antiviral resistance are rarely observed. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the (eventual) circulation of HBV variants with natural resistance to NAs currently used as therapy for CHB in Argentina. This study reports 13 cases of CHB-infected patients with natural antiviral resistance to at least one NA. Five of them were also carriers of S-variants that might escape the humoral immune system recognition with potential resistance to adefovir. In addition to the already reported A2 HBV subgenotype association to NAs natural resistance, E and F genotypes association to such resistance is described for the first time. These findings suggest that sequence analysis of the HBV reverse transcriptase might be an essential tool before starting antiviral therapy, in order to choose the proper NAs for optimizing the therapeutic management of chronically infected patients. Moreover, the circulation and transmission of S-mutants with resistance to such antiviral drugs should be of public health concern as they may represent an additional risk for the community."
4407,0.002,2.0000,"To study the pattern of transmission of HBV in a large urban community, an in-depth prospective study was performed in Hamburg between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002. In total, 524 patients were classified as hepatitis B cases according to the case definition of the Robert Koch Institute, comprising 197 foreign-born and 327 German-born persons. The principal risk factor was parenteral drug use, with 17.7% (n=93/524) of all documented cases of hepatitis B, followed by immigration as refugees (13.9%; n=73). Of all 524 cases, 72 (13.7%) were associated with heterosexual (n=41) or homosexual (n=31) transmission. Household contacts of HBV carriers or of patients with acute infectious disease contributed to 9.0% of the cases (n=47). Medical procedures were most probably the source in 7.4% (n=39), although only 3.2% (n=17) of all patients were health-care workers. In multivariate analysis of household contacts, male-male sexual activity was found to be the greatest risk factor for acquiring an acute HBV infection, followed by asylum-seeking status and the number of contacts. The incidence was 3.5-fold higher among foreign-born persons (16.1 per 100,000) than among German-born individuals (4.5 per 100,000) suggesting that a targeted intervention in this population group is a public-health need. The current national policy of vaccination in defined age groups should be extended to the immunization of all children of foreign-born parents as well as the screening and immunisation of susceptible foreign-born adults."
259,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been reported to be the aetiological factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. This study was therefore carried out to determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), a specific marker of HBV infection in patients with suspected liver diseases. The investigation was carried out among patients attending the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH), Nigeria with clinical symptoms suggestive of liver diseases and others with non-specific clinical features during the period from 1990-1995. A total of 197 (38%) of 517 patients tested positive for HBsAg, 81 (49%) out of 144 with symptoms suggestive of hepatitis, 75 (50%) of 149 HCC and 10 (56%) of 18 liver cirrhosis were HBsAg positive. Comparison of the yearly total prevalence values of HBsAg for the six years under study showed no significant difference. Similarly, yearly prevalence values amongst patients with suspected liver diseases showed no significant differences. Nevertheless, significant difference, (P < 0.05) between the prevalence of HBsAg among suspected cases of liver diseases and others with non-specific signs and symptoms was observed. Similarly, HBsAg was statistically significantly higher among males than females. The high prevalence rate of HBsAg in our environment may be associated with the suspected cases of liver diseases, which are equally prevalent in our locality. Health education to prohibit traditional practices that could predispose individuals to HBV infections is emphasised. The incorporation of HBV vaccination in the national programme on immunization currently in use in Nigeria is highly recommended. This would be an effective method of preventing HBV infection from childhood."
48,0.002,2.0000,"The polymerase chain reaction assay, branched DNA assay and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assay quantitate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA levels. Plasma viral load (PVL) testing has become a cornerstone of HIV disease management. Initiation of antiretroviral drug therapy is usually recommended when the PVL is 10,000 to 30,000 copies per mL or when CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts are less than 350 to 500 per mm3 (0.35 to 0.50 x 10(9) per L). PVL levels usually show a 1- to 2-log reduction within four to six weeks after therapy is started. The goal is no detectable virus in 16 to 24 weeks. Periodic monitoring of PVL is important to promptly identify treatment failure. When feasible, the same assay should be used for serial PVL testing in the individual patient. At least two PVL measurements usually should be performed before antiretroviral drug therapy is initiated or changed. PVL testing may be helpful in the rare instance of indeterminate HIV antibody testing, especially in a patient with recent infection."
1410,0.002,2.0000,"Despite the increased incidence of tuberculosis related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in recent decades, pancreatic tuberculosis has rarely been described. We report a case of pancreatic tuberculosis in a 39-year-old African man who presented with progressive dysphagia, vomiting, weight loss and productive cough, accompanied by localized epigastric pain and one episode of melena. HIV-1 testing was positive and lymphocyte subset profile showed CD(4) count of 9/mm(3). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast revealed a cystic mass in the body of the pancreas, significant portal and retroperitoneal cystic adenopathy, and multiple cystic lesions in the spleen and liver. CT guided cyst aspiration and node biopsy detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient responded well on antituberculosis and antiretroviral therapy. Tuberculosis rarely involves the pancreas, probably due to the presence of pancreatic enzymes which interfere with the seeding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Pancreatic tuberculosis is considered to be the result of dissemination of the infection from nearby lymphatic nodes. Endoscopic ultrasound or CT guided fine needle aspiration for cytology is the recommended diagnostic technique. Although the prognosis is good with anti-tuberculosis treatment, it could be fatal without correct diagnosis and treatment. The clinician's high index of suspicion of pancreatic tuberculosis and application of FNAB to obtain pathological evidence are extremely important to a correct diagnosis, especially in young HIV positive patients."
6194,0.002,2.0000,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is thought to be involved in the pathogenic and metabolic events associated with HIV-1 infection. We assessed whether carriage of the TNF-α gene promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with lipodystrophy and metabolic derangements in HIV-1-infected patients treated with cART. We also assessed variations in TNF-α receptor plasma levels. The study group comprised 286 HIV-1-infected patients (133 with and 153 without lipodystrophy) and 203 uninfected controls (UC). TNF-α -238G > A, -308G > A, and -863 C > A SNP were assessed using PCR-RFLPs on white cell DNA. Plasma sTNF-α R1 and R2 levels were measured by ELISA. Student's t test, the χ(2) test, Pearson correlations, and the logistic regression test were performed for statistical analysis. The TNF-α -308G > A SNP was significantly associated with lipodystrophy in the univariate analysis (p = 0.04). This association, however, was no longer significant in the multivariate analysis. A meta-analysis of the published literature and our own data, which included 284 patients with lipodystrophy and 338 without lipodystrophy, showed that there was no relationship between the TNF-α -238G > A and -308G > A SNP and lipodystrophy (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). HIV-1-infected patients had greater sTNF-α R2 plasma levels than UC (p = 0.001) whereas sTNF-α R1 and R2 levels were not significantly different in both the HIV-1-infected cohorts, lipodystrophy vs. nonlipodystrophy (p = NS). In our cohort of white Spaniards the TNF-α -238G > A, -308G > A, and -863C > A SNP were not associated with lipodystrophy in HIV-1-infected patients treated with cART. This finding was replicated in a meta-analysis of the published data, which showed no associations between the TNF-α -238G > A and -308G > A SNP and lipodystrophy. In HIV-1-infected patients under cART there is a systemic overproduction of sTNF-α R2, which is unrelated to the presence of lipodystrophy."
2085,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an in-frame stop codon within the pre-core region of the virus genome caused fulminant hepatitis in two individuals. Serum from a chronically infected patient who was the source of the virus was inoculated into three chimpanzees at dilutions of 10(-1), 10(-3), and 10(-7). All three chimpanzees developed acute hepatitis B with relatively high peak values of liver enzymes in their serum. The complete nucleotide sequence of virus DNA recovered from the chimpanzee serum by enzymatic amplification was identical with that from the human serum. By comparing the sequence of this strain (HT) with that of 32 published HBV genomes, changes in nucleotides and predicted amino acids that were rarely or never found in other HBV isolates were identified. Thirteen such nucleotides were found within the cis-acting regulatory elements, of which 6 were within the enhancer II-core promoter region. Twenty-four rare or unique changes in amino acids were found in open reading frames, of which 15 occurred in the region that spanned the 3' half of the X gene, through the pre-core/core gene, to the 5' end of the polymerase gene. Thus, an HBV pre-core stop mutant implicated in fulminant hepatitis is highly infectious, induces severe hepatitis in chimpanzees, and possesses significant genetic variation from reported HBV isolates."
5442,0.002,2.0000,"To determine the effect of active tuberculosis on survival and the incidence of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients, we performed a retrospective cohort study at four U.S. medical centers to compare the survival and incidence rate of opportunistic infections in 106 HIV-infected patients with active tuberculosis (cases) with that of 106 HIV-infected patients without tuberculosis (control subjects) but with a similar level of immunosuppression (measured by the absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count) as the cases. Cases and control subjects were similar with regard to age, sex, race, previous opportunistic infection, and use of antiretroviral therapy, but they were more likely than control subjects to have a history of intravenous drug use (49 versus 19%). The mean CD4+ counts were similar for cases and control subjects (154 versus 153 cells/microliters, respectively). The incidence rate of new AIDS-defining opportunistic infections in cases was 4.0 infections per 100 person-months compared with 2.8 infections per 100 person-months in control subjects for an incidence rate ratio (RR) of 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 0.94-2.11). Cases also had a shorter overall survival than did controls subjects (p = 0.001). Active tuberculosis was associated with an increased risk for death (odds ratio = 2.17), even when controlling for age, intravenous drug use, previous opportunistic infection, baseline CD4+ count, and antiretroviral therapy. Although active tuberculosis may be an independent marker of advanced immunosuppression in HIV-infected patients, it may also act as a cofactor to accelerate the clinical course of HIV infection."
9396,0.002,2.0000,"Recent studies have shown that a single-nucleotide polymorphism upstream of the interleukin-28B (IL28B) gene plays a major role in predicting therapeutic response in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin. We sought to investigate the mechanism of the IL28B polymorphism, specifically as it relates to early HCV viral kinetics, IFN pharmacokinetics, IFN pharmacodynamics, and gene expression profiles. Two prospective cohorts (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected) completing treatment with IFN/ribavirin were enrolled. Patients were genotyped at the polymorphic site rs12979860. In the HIV/HCV cohort, frequent serum sampling was completed for HCV RNA and IFN levels. DNA microarray of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and individual expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were quantified on IFN therapy. The IL28B-favorable (CC) genotype was associated with improved therapeutic response compared with unfavorable (CT or TT) genotypes. Patients with a favorable genotype had greater first- and second-phase viral kinetics (P = 0.004 and P = 0.036, respectively), IFN maximum antiviral efficiency (P = 0.007) and infected cell death loss (P = 0.009) compared with unfavorable genotypes. Functional annotation analysis of DNA microarray data was consistent with depressed innate immune function, particularly of natural killer cells, from patients with unfavorable genotypes (P <0.004). Induction of innate immunity genes was also lower in unfavorable genotypes. ISG expression at baseline and induction with IFN was independent of IL28B genotype."
4814,0.002,2.0000,"One goal of the HIV care continuum is achieving viral suppression (VS), yet disparities in suppression exist among subpopulations of HIV-infected persons. We sought to identify disparities in both the ability to achieve and sustain VS among an urban cohort of HIV-infected persons in care. Data from HIV-infected persons enrolled at the 13 DC Cohort study clinical sites between January 2011 and June 2014 were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were conducted to identify factors associated with achieving VS (viral load < 200 copies/ml) at least once, and Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with sustaining VS and time to virologic failure (VL ≥ 200 copies/ml after achievement of VS). Among the 4311 participants, 95.4% were either virally suppressed at study enrollment or able to achieve VS during the follow-up period. In multivariate analyses, achieving VS was significantly associated with age (aOR: 1.04; 95%CI: 1.03-1.06 per five-year increase) and having a higher CD4 (aOR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.04-1.06 per 100 cells/mm(3)). Patients infected through perinatal transmission were less likely to achieve VS compared to MSM patients (aOR: 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.79). Once achieved, most participants (74.4%) sustained VS during follow-up. Blacks and perinatally infected persons were less likely to have sustained VS in KM survival analysis (log rank chi-square p ≤ .001 for both) compared to other races and risk groups. Earlier time to failure was observed among females, Blacks, publically insured, perinatally infected, those with longer standing HIV infection, and those with diagnoses of mental health issues or depression. Among this HIV-infected cohort, most people achieved and maintained VS; however, disparities exist with regard to patient age, race, HIV transmission risk, and co-morbid conditions. Identifying populations with disparate outcomes allows for appropriate targeting of resources to improve outcomes along the care continuum."
7683,0.002,2.0000,"The T-cell-mediated immune response plays a crucial role in defense against hepatotropic viruses as well as in the pathogenesis of viral chronic hepatitides. However, very little is known about the role of specific T cells during hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in humans. In this study, the T-cell response to HDV in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers with HDV superinfection was investigated at different levels. Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation in response to a recombinant form of large hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) revealed that 8 of 30 patients studied (27%) specifically responded to HDAg. By employing synthetic peptides spanning the entire HDAg sequence, we found that T-cell recognition was directed against different antigenic determinants, with patient-to-patient variation in the pattern of response to peptides. Interestingly, all responders had signs of inactive HDV-induced disease, while none of the patients with active disease and none of the control subjects showed any significant proliferation. More accurate information about the specific T-cell response was obtained at the clonal level. A panel of HDAg-specific CD4+ T-cell clones from three HDV-infected individuals and fine-specificity analysis revealed that the clones tested individually recognized four epitopes corresponding to amino acids (aa) 26 to 41, 50 to 65, 66 to 81, or 106 to 121 of HDAg sequence. The study of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction revealed that peptides 50 to 65 and 106 to 121 were presented to specific T cells in association with multiple class II molecules. In addition, peptide 26 to 41 was efficiently generated after processing of HDAg through the endogenous processing pathway. Cytokine secretion analysis showed that all the CD4+ T-cell clones assayed were able to produce high levels of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), belonging either to T helper-1 (Th1) or Th0 subsets and that some of them were cytotoxic in a specific assay. This study provides the first evidence that detection of a specific T-cell response to HDAg in the peripheral blood of individuals with hepatitis delta is related to the decrease of HDV-induced disease activity. The HDAg epitopes identified here and particularly those recognized by CD4+ T cells in association with multiple major histocompatibility complex class II molecules may be potentially exploited for the preparation of a vaccine for prophylaxis and therapy of HDV infection."
5831,0.002,2.0000,"Lymphoid tissues are the primary target during the initial virus dissemination that occurs in HIV-1-infected individuals. Recent advances in antiretroviral therapy and techniques to monitor virus load in humans have demonstrated that the early stages of viral infection and host response are major determinants of the outcome of individual infections. Relatively little is known about immunopathogenic events occurring during the acute phase of HIV infection. We analyzed viral dissemination within lymphoid tissues by in situ hybridization and by combined immunohistochemistry/in situ hybridization during the acute infection phase (12 hours to 28 days) in pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina), challenged intravenously with a virulent strain of HIV-2, HIV-2(287). Two stages in viral dissemination were clearly evident within the first 28 days after HIV-2(287) infection. First, a massive increase in individual HIV-2-infected cells, mostly CD3+ T lymphocytes and a smaller percentage of macrophages and interdigitating dendritic cells, was identified within lymph nodes which peaked on the 10th day after HIV-2 infection. A shift of HIV-2 distribution was demonstrable between day 10 and day 14 after HIV-2 infection. Coincident with a marked reduction in individual HIV-2 RNA+ cells by day 14 postinfection, there was a dramatic increase in germinal center-associated HIV-2 RNA. High concentrations of HIV-2 RNA persisted in germinal centers in all animals by days 21 and 28 postinfection. Thus, HIV-2 appears to go through an initial, highly disseminated cellular phase followed by localization in the follicular dendritic cell network with relatively few infected cells. In this nonhuman primate model of HIV-associated immunopathogenesis, using a virus derived from a human pathogen, we identified a significant shift in the pattern of HIV-2 localization within a narrow time frame (day 10 to day 14). This shift in virus localization and behavior indicates that there may be a discrete but remarkably narrow window for therapeutic interventions that interrupt this stage in the natural course of HIV infection. Reproducibility and the accelerated time course of disease development make this model an excellent candidate for such intervention studies."
7715,0.002,2.0000,"Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a fatal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by JC virus (JCV), a human polyomavirus that can lytically infect and destroy the oligodendrocites in immunosuppressed individuals. After the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for AIDS treatment, a PML-like leukoencephalopathy, known as non-determined leukoencephalopathy (NDLE), has also been observed. Since a number of host genetic factors have been identified as having an impact on susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and in the progression to AIDS and death, in this work we analysed the pattern of distribution of different chemokine and chemokine receptor polymorphisms that seem to be involved in HIV+ neurological diseases. The CCR5, RANTES, CCR2 and SDF1 genes were molecularly analysed in 84 HIV+ HAART treated subjects: 55 without neurological disorders (HIV+), 12 HIV+ NDLE and 17 HIV+ PML patients. The RANTES -403 G/A polymorphism was significantly associated with NDLE. These data suggest that mutation of the RANTES allele can predispose to the induction of demyelination similarly to what has been observed in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and may suggest a possible explanation for the development of leukoencephalopathy without detection of JCV."
2539,0.002,2.0000,"Current product labels for maraviroc and raltegravir provide no dosing guidance for patients with end-stage liver disease and worsening renal function. We describe a 41-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and rapidly progressive liver failure and vanishing bile duct syndrome at presentation. Despite discontinuation of all potential offending drugs, the patient's liver function continued to deteriorate. To achieve and maintain HIV suppression while awaiting liver transplantation, a regimen consisting of maraviroc, raltegravir, and enfuvirtide was started. These agents were chosen because the patient was not exposed to them before the onset of liver failure. While receiving product label-recommended twice-daily dosing of these drugs, he achieved and maintained HIV suppression. During a complicated and prolonged hospitalization, the patient also developed renal dysfunction. As hepatic metabolism is the primary route of clearance of maraviroc and raltegravir, we predicted that using approved doses of these drugs could result in significant drug accumulation. Since the safety profiles of supratherapeutic concentrations of these agents are not well defined, we chose to use therapeutic drug monitoring to guide further dosing. The reported concentrations showed severely impaired metabolic clearance of both drugs, with markedly prolonged elimination half-lives of 189 hours for maraviroc and 61 hours for raltegravir. Previously reported half-lives for maraviroc and raltegravir in HIV-infected patients with normal hepatic and renal function are 14-18 hours and 9-12 hours, respectively. Based on these results, the dosing intervals were extended from twice/day to twice/week for maraviroc and every 48 hours for raltegravir. Unfortunately, the patient's clinical condition continued to deteriorate, and he eventually died of complications related to end-stage liver disease. This case illustrates the difficulties in managing antiretroviral therapy in an HIV-infected patient with combined severe liver and renal failure. Prolonged excessively high exposure to maraviroc and raltegravir is likely to result in some level of concentration-dependent toxicity. Until more data are available, therapeutic drug monitoring remains the only evidence-based approach to optimize dosage selection of these drugs in this patient population."
3978,0.002,2.0000,"GB virus C (GBV-C), which is highly prevalent among HIV/AIDS, seemed to slow the HIV disease progression. The HIV/GBV-C co-infected individuals may represent an interesting model for the investigation of the role played by HIV infection and/or the immune system in driving the evolution of the GBV-C viral populations. The present study investigated the prevalence and population dynamics of GB virus C in HIV infected individuals representing 13 geographic regions of Hubei Province of China. Approximately 37% of HIV-1 infected individuals were infected with GBV-C and genotype 3 is appeared to be predominant. Utilizing the 196 complete E2 nucleotide sequence data from 10 HIV/GBV-C infected individuals and employing coalescence based phylogenetic approaches; the present study has investigated the intra-host dynamics of GBV-C. The results revealed patient-specific unique GBV-C viral lineages and each viral lineage showed the evidence of rapid population expansion in respective HIV-1 infected patients, thus suggesting HIV-1 was unlikely to have been inhibiting effect on the GBV-C viral replication. GBV-C in all patients has experienced intense purifying selection, suggesting the GBV-C viral invasion and subsequent expansion within the HIV-1 infected hosts without any modification of the functional epitopes at their membrane protein. The finding of within host GBV-C recombinant sequences indicated recombination was one of the significant forces in the evolution and divergence of GBV-C."
144,0.002,2.0000,"HIV-1 uses the coreceptors CCR5 and/or CXCR4 for cell entry. Monotropic CCR5-using variants are found early in the infection while CXCR4-using variants may appear after progression to AIDS. CXCR4 use may consist of both monotropic and dualtropic viruses. The viral phenotype is important in evaluating the response to CCR5 inhibitors, a new class of antiviral drugs. The coreceptor use of HIV-1 was investigated using population sequencing in 24 patients from Botswana, carrying HIV-1 subtype C and failing antiretroviral treatment, while 26 treatment-naive patients acted as controls. Single genome sequencing was used to discern minor HIV-1 populations in the treatment-experienced group. The Geno2Pheno method was employed to predict the coreceptor use phenotype from HIV-1 env gp120 V3 DNA sequences. The glycan-charge model adjusted for subtype C was also used for phenotype prediction. The viral phenotype of population sequences was predicted using Geno2Pheno in 24/24 treatment-experienced patients, of whom eight (33%) were predicted to harbor CXCR4-using strains as compared to 2/26 in the treatment-naive group (p=0.03). Single genome sequencing generated 4-23 clones/patient in the treatment-experienced group. Altogether, 90/295 (31%) putative CXCR4-using clones were identified. In 10/24 (42%) treated patients at least one clone was predicted to be CXCR4-using, further increasing the amount of identified treatment-experienced patients with CXCR4 use. Although subtype C is usually associated with comparatively little CXCR4 use, the frequency of CXCR4 use in treatment-experienced patients with subtype C can be higher, which may have implications for the administration of CCR5 inhibitors in this patient group."
7293,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection results in different clinical presentation due to different levels of immune response. Our study aimed to characterize HBV full-length genome quasispecies (QS) in patients with different phases of infection to better understand its pathogenesis. Forty treatment-naive HBV-infected patients were enrolled, including 10 cases of acute hepatitis B (AHB), 9 cases of immunotolerant (IT) HBV carriers, 11 cases of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and 10 cases of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). The present study was conducted by clone-based sequencing. QS heterogeneity within each open reading frame was calculated. The mutation frequency index (MFI) and amino acid variations within the large HBsAg, HBcAg, and HBxAg regions were analyzed based on the different infection phases. In total, 606 HBV full-length sequences were obtained. HBV QS had higher heterogeneity in ACLF and CHB than that in IT among chronically infected individuals. AHB patients had the lower QS heterogeneity at onset than those with chronic infection. ACLF patients had the highest frequency of mutations in the core promoter and precore region. A triple mutation (A1762T/G1764A/G1896A) was observed more frequently in genotype C than in genotype B. The MFI indicated that specific peptides of the studied regions had more frequent mutations in ACLF. Furthermore, several amino acid variations, known as T- and B-cell epitopes, were potentially associated with the immunoactive phase of infection. More HBV genome mutations and deletions were observed in patients with more severe diseases, particularly in specific regions of the core and preS regions, the clinical significance and mechanism of which need to be further investigated.

952,0.002,2.0000,"Studies were conducted to determine if there is a mechanistic basis for reports of suboptimal virologic responses and concerns regarding the safety of regimens containing the combination of tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and didanosine (ddI) by assessing the pharmacokinetic consequences of coadministration of these drugs on intracellular nucleotides. This was a prospective and longitudinal study in HIV-1-infected patients of adding either TDF or ddI to a stable antiretroviral regimen containing the other drug. Intracellular concentrations of the nucleotide analogs TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP) and ddATP and the endogenous purine nucleotides dATP and 2'-dGTP in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured. A total of 16 patients were enrolled into the two study arms and a study extension. Intracellular TFV-DP concentrations (median, 120 fmol/10(6) cells) and ddATP concentrations (range, 1.50 to 7.54 fmol/10(6) cells in two patients) were unaffected following addition of ddI or TDF to a stable regimen containing the other drug. While coadministration of ddI and TDF for 4 weeks did not appear to impact dATP or dGTP concentrations, cross-sectional analysis suggested that extended therapy with ddI-containing regimens, irrespective of TDF coadministration, may decrease dATP and ddATP concentrations. Addition of TDF or ddI to a stable regimen including the other drug, in the context of ddI dose reduction, did not adversely affect the concentration of dATP, dGTP, TFV-DP, or ddATP. The association between longer-term ddI therapy and reduced intracellular nucleotide concentrations and this observation's implication for the efficacy and toxicity of ddI-containing regimens deserve further study."

The sample consisted of 272 IDUs enrolled in the AjUDE-Brasil I Project, a cross-sectional multi-center study conducted in five Brazilian cities in 1998. Data were collected with a structured questionnaire using self-reported risk behavior, and HCV and HIV serological status used ELISA on filter paper. IDUs were clustered in four distinct groups: HCV/HIV seronegative; HCV mono-infected; HIV mono-infected; and HCV/HIV co-infected. Active sharing of injecting equipment was associated with HCV infection (p = 0.001). Sexual behavior variables, especially male same-sex sexual relations, were consistently associated with HIV infection. HCV/HIV co-infection was associated with both sexual and drug use variables. It was possible to distinguish different behavioral indicators for HCV and HIV infection and co-infection in this population."
7609,0.002,2.0000,"Opportunistic diseases cause substantial morbidity and mortality to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) leading to immune reconstitution is the most effective treatment of preventing opportunistic diseases. This retrospective study established an epidemiologic profile of opportunistic diseases 10 years after the introduction of HAART. The HIV antiretroviral therapy-naive patients matching inclusion criteria were included. The primary outcome was the prevalence of opportunistic diseases. From January 1, 2002 to September 30, 2010, 654 opportunistic diseases were identified in 458 patients. Pulmonary tuberculosis, herpes zoster, cerebral toxoplasmosis, oral candidiasis, and severe pneumonia accounted for 22.05%, 15.94%, 14.19%, 14.19%, and 9.39%, respectively. Cryptococcal meningitis and pneumocystosis accounted for 0.44% and 0.21%, respectively. The prevalence of opportunistic diseases in Gabon remains high. New guidelines emphasize the importance of initiating antiretroviral therapy early to reconstitute the immune system, and reduce disease risk, and treat the primary opportunistic infection of pulmonary tuberculosis."
7523,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected males have poor treatment outcomes after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to HIV-infected women. Dietary factors might mediate the association between sex and disease progression. However, the gender difference in diet among HIV-infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa is largely unknown. The objective of this study was to examine differences in dietary intake among HIV-infected men and women. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of dietary questionnaire data from 2038 adults initiating ART in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to assess whether nutrient adequacy differed by sex. We dichotomized participants' nutrient intakes by whether recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) were met and estimated the relative risk (RR) of meeting RDAs in males using binomial regression models. We also estimated the mean difference in intake of foods and food groups by gender. We found poorer dietary practices among men compared to women. Males were less likely to meet the RDAs for micronutrients critical for slowing disease progression among HIV patients: niacin (RR = 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27 to 0.55), riboflavin (RR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.91), vitamin C (RR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.00), and zinc (RR = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.24). Intake of thiamine, pantothenate, vitamins B6, B12, and E did not vary by gender. Males were less likely to eat cereals (mean difference [servings per day] = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.44 to 0.001) and vegetables (mean difference = -0.47, 95% CI: -0.86 to -0.07) in their diet, but more likely to have meat (mean difference = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.21). We conclude that male HIV patients have poorer dietary practices than females, and this may contribute to faster progression of the disease in males. "
787,0.002,2.0000,"Concerns have been raised that universal availability of antiretroviral agents in resource-limited settings might lead to the emergence and spread of resistant strains. We present the largest survey on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resistance among treatment-naïve and experienced patients followed in small, relatively underprivileged cities in Brazil with universal availability to standard of care antiretroviral combinations. Samples were collected between 2004 and 2006 from 95 patients followed in the cities of Saquarema and Santo Antonio de Pádua, state of Rio de Janeiro. A proviral fragment encompassing protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) regions was generated and drug susceptibility level was inferred. Among 50 strains from drug-naïve subjects, one (2%) had intermediate-level resistance to RT inhibitors. Among 38 patients on therapy as of sampling, 28 (73.7%) had plasma viral load (PVL) below detection limit (26 of whom without evidence of resistance mutations) and 11 (28.9%) harbored strains with reduced susceptibility. Only two strains harbored both protease and RT inhibitor mutations. Among seven patients who were off-treatment as of sampling, two (28.5%) harbored strains with reduced susceptibility to RT inhibitors. The relatively high frequency of undetectable PVL among patients on treatment and the overall low prevalence of resistance-associated mutations are reassuring. Continued surveillance, however, is necessary."
8938,0.002,2.0000,"Many regions within the envelope of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that affect its structure and function have been identified. We have previously reported that the interaction of the second conserved (C2) and third variable (V3) regions of gp120 influences the ability of HIV-1 to establish a productive infection in susceptible cells. To better understand the basis for this interaction, we have conducted structure-function analyses of envelope expressed from molecular proviral clones of HIV-1 containing defined mutations in C2 and V3 that individually and in combination differentially affect envelope function. The substitution of a glutamine for an asparagine residue (Q-267) at a potential asparagine-linked glycosylation site in C2, which severely impairs virus infectivity, reduces intracellular processing of gp160 into gp120, the association of gp120 with virions, and the ability of gp120 to bind to the HIV-1 cell surface receptor protein, CD4. The change of an arginine to an isoleucine codon in V3 (I-308), in the presence of the Q-267 mutation, restores virus infectivity to near wild-type levels by increasing the amount of gp120 associated with virions as compared with the Q-267 mutant but does not compensate for the Q-267-induced processing defect. The I-308 change in the context of the wild-type HIV-1 has no affect on processing, association, or CD4 binding. These results indicate that the impaired infectivity of the Q-267 mutant virus is due to a marked reduction in the amount of virion gp120 and suggest that the interaction of C2 and V3 stabilizes the association of gp120 with gp41."
5025,0.002,2.0000,"Exenatide is an incretin mimetic indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, metformin, or metformin plus a sulfonylurea or thiazolidinedione. Exenatide lowers postprandial blood glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and increasing satiety. Therapy with exenatide often results in weight loss, which further assists in decreasing insulin resistance. This feature makes the drug an attractive therapeutic option for obese patients. We report the successful off-label use of exenatide in an obese, 40-year-old man with type 1 diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who had gastrointestinal intolerance to pramlintide. The patient had experienced a dramatic weight gain secondary to his antiretroviral drugs. This weight gain led to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes; thus he had characteristics of both types 1 and 2 diabetes, or double diabetes. Before the start of exenatide therapy, he weighed 123 kg, had a body mass index of 42.3 kg/m(2), and had a suboptimal hemoglobin A(1c) value of 8.7%. After 11 months of therapy, the patient lost 24 kg (19.5% of his body weight) and achieved a hemoglobin A(1c) value of 7.3%. His basal insulin requirement was reduced by 25%, and his use of short-acting insulin before breakfast and before dinner was discontinued. In addition, the patient's quality of life substantially improved, as he was able to return to work and exercise after being nearly incapacitated by his weight. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of the use of exenatide in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Given this experience, exenatide may prove to be a useful alternative in selected patients with type 1 diabetes."
5595,0.002,2.0000,"This clinical report provides guidance for the pediatrician in addressing the psychosocial needs of adolescents and young adults living with HIV, which can improve linkage to care and adherence to life-saving antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Recent national case surveillance data for youth (defined here as adolescents and young adults 13 to 24 years of age) revealed that the burden of HIV/AIDS fell most heavily and disproportionately on African American youth, particularly males having sex with males. To effectively increase linkage to care and sustain adherence to therapy, interventions should address the immediate drivers of ARV compliance and also address factors that provide broader social and structural support for HIV-infected adolescents and young adults. Interventions should address psychosocial development, including lack of future orientation, inadequate educational attainment and limited health literacy, failure to focus on the long-term consequences of near-term risk behaviors, and coping ability. Associated challenges are closely linked to the structural environment. Individual case management is essential to linkage to and retention in care, ARV adherence, and management of associated comorbidities. Integrating these skills into pediatric and adolescent HIV practice in a medical home setting is critical, given the alarming increase in new HIV infections in youth in the United States. "
149,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has infected an estimated 170 million people worldwide, most of whom are chronically infected (60% to 80%). In Italy, the estimate of anti-HCV antibody (Ab) prevalence, in the general population of Northern Italy, is 3.2%; in Central and Southern Italy, it is 8.4% to 22.4%. Highest prevalence of infection (70% to 90%) is found among intravenous drug users. Our purpose is to monitor HCV infection among drug users treated in a Drug Addiction Centre (Ser.T) in Naples and to gain a better understanding of that relationship with the abused substance(s). Epidemiological data are shown for viral coinfections. Finally, the authors investigate access to specific HCV therapy in an Italian Ser.T. The study analyzed a group of 1753 consecutive subjects treated from 1988 to 2008 in the O.U. Ser.T D.S.31 (Gesù e Maria Hospital), ASL Napoli 1 Centre. HCV Abs were detected by enzyme immune assay method and confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay III method. During the entire period, we performed real-time polymerase chain reaction at random for 312 patients. The incidence (per year) of HCV infection showed a rapid spread decrease from 49.5% in 2003 to 14.5% in 2008. The overall prevalence of HCV was 48.1%. We tested 312 randomly selected patients for viral replication. Our study showed active viral replication in 201 (64.4%) patients as follows: 97 of 201 (31.1%) resulted infected by genotype (gt) 1; 3 of 201 (1.0%) gt 2; 84 of 201 (26.9%) gt 3; and 4 of 201 (1.3%) gt 4. Coinfection data showed that HCV Ab prevalence was 58.5% (48 of 82) in hepatitis B virus chronically infected patients. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfection resulted in 95.2% (80 of 84) HIV patients. The prevalence of HIV Abs in HCV-infected patients was 8.99% (80 of 889). Analysis of drug abuse showed high prevalence of opiate addicted, multiabusers, and with high-risk factors. Cocaine abuser prevalence was 14.4%, and incidence, during past 4 years of the study, rose to 42.6%. Alcohol abuser prevalence represented 5.8% of patients and incidence rose to 17.7% in final 4 years of the study. In those opiate addicted, HCV infection was 61.0% (805 of 1320). HCV infection in cocaine-addicted patients was 9.5% (24 of 253). In 78 delta-9-tetra-hydro-cannabinol addicted patients, 5.1% of tests were positive (4 of 78). In alcohol abusers, HCV infection was 9.8% (10 of 102). Access to HCV treatment in our cohort from 2000 to 2008 resulted low (15.4%). Enhancing the Ser.Ts efficiency can result in health and financial benefits."
2818,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatic steatosis is an emerging cause of morbidity in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced HIV patients. The influence of steatosis on fibrosis is poorly understood. We report two cases of rapid evolution of disseminated macrovacuolar steatofibrosis to cirrhosis. Both patients had no history of alcohol abuse, nor intravenous drug use and were tested negative for HCV (PCR RNA) and had no HBS antigen. Patient 1 had a past history of hypertrygliceridemia, but controlled with dietetic measures for 4 years prior to biopsy. The first hepatic biopsy showed a disseminated macrovacuolar steatosis (>80%). The patient had then cytolysis and an uncontrolled HIV viral load. The second biopsy was performed two years later, and HIV was controlled by a new line of ART. It showed a regression of the steatosis (10%) and a progression of the fibrosis with signs of cirrhosis. Patient 2 had a long history of HIV infection. He also had an uncontrolled dyslipidemia. The first biopsy was realised during a period of uncontrolled HIV infection and elevated liver enzymes. The biopsy showed a major macrovacuolar steatosis (>80%). The second biopsy was realised 6 years after and showed the same steatosis and signs of cirrhosis. The HIV infection was then under control. Observations reported here show a rapid evolution of liver steatosis to cirrhosis in HIV positive / HCV negative patients, despite the control of HIV infection. The implication of HAART remains unclear. In the era of HAART, liver steatosis can rapidly evoluate to cirrhosis without any risk factor except ART."

Marijuana use was associated with a decreased rate of progression to AIDS in the univariate analysis (RR = 0.7; P = 0.01). Marijuana use was more common among individuals with elevated HIV viral core protein antibody (p24Ab) titer (> 1:16) at baseline (P = 0.03); this finding suggests that marijuana users were healthier at baseline. When the data were adjusted for p24 Ab and other laboratory parameters, no association with progression to AIDS was observed for marijuana, suggesting that the observed univariate result was due to a difference in HIV-related disease at the time of enrollment. No statistically significant associations were observed for nitrites, methylene dioxyamphetamines, ethyl chloride, downers, cocaine, stimulants, narcotics, or psychedelic drugs. These data suggest no substantial association between use of these drugs and the development of AIDS among HIV-infected men."
3911,0.002,2.0000,"The simultaneous presence of multiple HIV-1 subtypes has become common in communities with the growth of the pandemic. As a consequence, the potentiality for an increased frequency of HIV-1 mixed infections caused by viruses of distinct subtypes could be expected. Thus, there is a need to estimate the prevalence and geographic distribution of infections caused by viruses of a singular subtype as well as coinfections caused by two or more HIV-1 strains of distinct subtypes. To address this need, we have developed a genetic method based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to screen for these two types of infections within infected populations. In this assay, restriction enzymes may be used to predict the phylogroup of HIV-1 infected samples. A 297 bp pol fragment spanning the entire viral protease gene and a 311 bp fragment of the p24 gag region are used for this analysis. The viral regions are amplified by nested PCR using DNA templates from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or virus culture. Classification of HIV-1 strains to well defined subtypes B, D, F, and A/C is done by sequential endonuclease restriction analysis of a PCR amplified-protease gene followed by analysis of the p24 gag region. The electrophoretic migration patterns visualized by ethidium bromide staining or by radiolabeled probes are then determined on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. In infections caused by viruses of a singular subtype, a single restriction pattern is detected, whereas in multiple infections caused by two or more viral strains of different subtypes, the combination of different digestion patterns are observed in infected individuals. Using this methodology we have screened for genetic variations in HIV-1 proviral DNA from thirty-three Brazilian samples. Our RFLP procedure classified thirty-two samples as single infections caused by viruses of subtypes B (31) and F (1), and one sample as dual infection caused by distinct viral strains. Subsequent sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the viral protease gene in lymphocytes of all these patients confirmed our RFLP findings in single infections, and demonstrated the existence of two distinct HIV-1 strains of subtypes F and D in a patient which lymphocytes showed the simultaneous presence of two different digestion patterns. As up to now, single infections caused by subtype D variants were not identified in Brazil, our data provide the first evidence of subtype D HIV-1 in this country. Because sequencing of HIV proviral DNA is not particularly practical for large-scale molecular epidemiological studies, the protease/gag-based RFLP screening method will be useful to predict the phylogroup of HIV-1, and to identify multiple infections caused by HIV-1 strains of distinct subtypes. We believe that this information is crucial for both evaluation of the HIV-1/AIDS pandemic and intervention strategies."
8433,0.002,2.0000,"In order to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in Royal Australian Navy personnel and to formulate policies for their education, screening and vaccination, a voluntary survey was undertaken. Seven hundred and forty-eight subjects completed a questionnaire that provided details of age, sex, rank, ethnic origin, service abroad, length of service, history of tattooing, liver disease and blood transfusions. Serum was assayed by radioimmunoassay for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (antiHBs) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (antiHBc). The presence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection was correlated with ""risk factors"" by means of the chi 2 test of independence. Fourteen (74%) of 19 personnel from the Pacific Islands, Asia and Africa who were excluded from analysis showed one-or-more such markers. The prevalence of any marker of hepatitis B virus infection was 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9%-5.9%). The individual markers HBsAg, antiHBs and antiHBc were found in 0.4% (95% CI, 0.1%-1.2%), 3.6% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.9%) and 3.9% (95% CI, 2.5%-5.3%) of subjects, respectively. The annual attack rate was estimated to be less than 1%. Factors which had a significant correlation with an increased prevalence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection included tattooing (especially if this had been performed in Asia), age, the duration of service and service abroad. Based on these data, and given the reduced cost of hepatitis B vaccines, vaccination now is considered worth while. A policy of vaccinating all personnel who may be required for service at sea, and others at risk, now is in effect. Educational programmes that are aimed at minimizing the risk of exposure to hepatitis B and other viral infections have been instituted."
4552,0.002,2.0000,"Patients with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection have more severe hepatitis-related disease than do patients with HCV infection alone. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with protease inhibitor appears to restore pathogen-specific immune responses, especially in patients with persistent undetectable HIV viral load. To evaluate the potent impact of immune restoration induced by HAART on the course of HCV-related disease, HCV viremia and levels of transaminases were compared between two groups of patients: 10 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with persistently undetectable HIV viremia (group A) and 12 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with persistent detectable HIV viremia. No difference was detected in HCV viral load in either group. An increase in transaminases was found only in patients with persistent undetectable HIV viral load, which was correlated with the increase in CD8+ T cells. This may suggest that the restoration of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity could lead to an enhancement of hepatitis C-related disease in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients receiving HAART."
130,0.002,2.0000,"Longitudinal changes in neutralizing antibody responses against autologous human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 were investigated in 19 chronically infected patients who were undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Reconstitution of or increase in neutralization activity was observed in 4 of 19 patients during HAART, but neutralization activity was more or less unchanged in most patients. Three of 4 patients with increased neutralization activity had low-level viral rebound (""blips"") during HAART. No correlation was found between neutralization activity and HIV-specific CD4+ T cell frequencies. There was a correlation between neutralization activity and CD4+ T cell counts. The reconstituted antibody represented limited cross-reactivity, compared with that of preexisting antibody. Binding activity to monomeric gp120, V2, and V3 peptides was reduced. Both prolonged virus suppression, for CD4+ T cell recovery, and blips, for stimulation of the immune system in vivo, may be required for development of neutralizing antibody in vivo."
5492,0.002,2.0000,"Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is still a major health problem world-wide. HIV infection has changed into a chronic infection with the chance of developing long-term complications. Vascular complications are frequently reported in the current literature. HIV and treatment by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are associated with many cardiovascular risk factors. An increased risk of arterial cardiovascular complications was found in a number of studies. However, data about the risk of venous thrombotic disease (VTE), including potentially fatal conditions as pulmonary embolism, were limited. In a systematic review of the literature, ten relevant epidemiological studies were identified that investigated the risk of venous thrombotic disease in HIV-infected patients. The incidence was increased two- to tenfold in comparison with a healthy population of the same age. However, these studies were mainly retrospective cohort studies that were prone to selection bias, confounding factors were not always mentioned and in all but three control populations were missing. An increased risk of venous thrombotic disease in HIV-infected patients could be explained by the presence of a hypercoagulable state, characterised by an increase in procoagulant factors, such as endothelial TF expression and thrombogenic properties of microparticles, and a decrease in anticoagulant factors, including AT III, HC II and the protein C pathway. Furthermore, the risk of VTE was associated with an increased risk of infections and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, and was weakly associated with HAART. All together, quite some evidence pointed towards a relationship between HIV infection and venous thrombotic disease, but the association still needs to be established in properly designed epidemiological studies."
1794,0.002,2.0000,"The burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related disease in sub-Saharan Africa continues to increase; providing adequate care for the huge number of people affected is a daunting task, especially given the limited resources available. Recent studies have shown that low-cost regimens can prevent some of the most important causes of HIV-related disease in African countries. Isoniazid preventive therapy can reduce the incidence of tuberculosis; priorities are to seek opportunities for implementation, to assess effectiveness under operational conditions, and to monitor its effect on resistance patterns. Cotrimoxazole was shown to be highly effective in reducing morbidity and mortality among individuals with symptomatic HIV disease in Côte d'Ivoire, and should be implemented where it is likely to be of benefit. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was disappointingly ineffective among HIV-infected Ugandan adults, but newer conjugate vaccines are becoming available that should be investigated. The benefit of these preventive regimens to the individual may be modest when compared with the effect of antiretroviral therapy. However, simple preventive therapies could reach a much wider population than is immediately feasible for expensive and complex antiretroviral regimens, and thus have the potential for substantial benefit at the population level. The availability of effective and affordable regimens to prevent HIV-related disease may also encourage people to seek HIV testing, combat denial, and help overcome the sense of powerlessness in countries where the HIV epidemic has hit hardest."
1030,0.002,2.0000,"The prevalence of intestinal parasitic diseases and their associated factors has been investigated in HIV populations from the Island of Bioko, Equatorial Guinea. The feces of 310 participants from the island of Bioko (260 HIV-positive and 50 HIV-negative) were analyzed by microscopic observation. Immunochromatography was also used to diagnose Giardia, Entamoeba histolytica and Cryptosporidium spp. In addition, patients were asked for sociodemographic, economic and academic status, and CD4+ T cell counts were recorded. For HIV-positive patients, the prevalence of infection by intestinal parasites was 81.5% (212/260), 83.8% (218/260) by pathogenic helminths and 55.4% (168/260) by pathogenic protozoa (E. histolytica/dispar and Giardia duodenalis). Gender association was found between the infection by Ascaris and Schistosoma, a higher proportion being found in women; and between Entamoeba and the place of residence, a higher proportion being observed in the urban belt. Strongyloides stercoralis and Chilomastix mesnili appeared only in the people of this group, all the cases of Chilomastix being in females. For HIV-negative participants, the prevalence of infection by intestinal parasites was 74.0% (37/50), 90.0% (45/50) by pathogenic helminths and 66.0% (43/50) by pathogenic protozoa. Gender, educational level and low hygiene were associated with intestinal parasitic infection. When comparing the two groups (HIV-positive and HIV-negative), statistical association between HIV co-infection and infection by Giardia and Entamoeba was found. Diarrhea was also associated with intestinal parasitic infection in the HIV-positive group. Not only do our findings reflect high rates of intestinal parasitic infections in HIV-positive people, but also in the HIV-negative group, suggesting a closer relationship between sanitary status and living conditions than with immune status, and thus they highlight the need to carry out health education policies in the population. In addition, Schistosoma intercalatum/guineensis has been detected for the first time as an autochthonous parasite on the island."
2821,0.002,2.0000,"This study was designed to investigate the contribution of miRNA-122-binding site polymorphism at the IL-1A gene and its multiplicative interactions with hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutations in the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 1021 healthy controls, 302 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance subjects, and 2011 HBsAg-positive subjects (including 1021 HCC patients) were enrolled in this study. Quantitative PCR was used to genotype rs3783553. HBV mutations were determined by direct sequencing. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to test the associations of rs3783553, mutations, and their interactions with the risk of HCC. No significant association was found between rs3783553 and the risk of HCC among healthy controls, HBsAg seroclearance subjects, HBsAg-positive subjects without HCC, and all controls. Additionally, rs3783553 was not significantly associated with chronic HBV infection, liver cirrhosis, HBV e antigen seroconversion, abnormal alanine aminotransferase, and high viral load (> 10(4) copies/ml). However, the TTCA insertion allele of rs3783553 was significantly associated with an increased frequency of HBV C7A mutation compared with homozygous TTCA deletion carriers [(del/ins + ins/ins) vs. del/del, adjusted odds ratio (OR)= 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI)= 1.09-2.02, P = 0.013]. Multiplicative interaction of rs3783553 with HBV preS deletion significantly reduced the risk of HCC in males, with an adjusted OR of 0.64 (95% CI = 0.42-0.98; P = 0.041) after age and HBV genotype were adjusted. Although rs3783553 did not significantly affect genetic susceptibility to HBV-related HCC, its variant allele may predispose the host to selecting HBV C7A mutation during evolution and significantly reduce the risk of HCC caused by HBV preS deletion. This study provides an insight into the complex host-virus interaction in HBV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis and is helpful in determining HBsAg-positive subjects who are likely to develop HCC. "
9371,0.002,2.0000,"Human Immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) share common modes of transmission which include blood borne and the vertical routes. Although, the natural course of HIV does not appear altered by HBV, the rate of liver-related deaths is several times higher among HIV/HBV co-infected persons. Clinicians providing care for HIV positive individuals, including pregnant women, need to be aware of this problem. This is a 2-year cross-sectional study that commenced in January 2006, among HIV positive pregnant women seen at the University College Hospital, Ibadan. During the study period, 721 HIV positive pregnant women were screened for hepatitis B virus infection. Sixty-four women (8.9%) were positive for HBsAg, 14(1.9%) were HCV positive and 642 (89.2%) were negative for both HBV and HCV. One patient was positive forboth HBV and HCV. There were no remarkable differences between HIV infected and HIV-HBV coinfected patients in terms of the hematological, albumin and bilirubin measurements. Alanine transaminase was however higher in the HIV-HBV co-infected patients than HIV patients and this was statistically significant (17.5 iu/ ml vs. 15.0 iu/ml, p value--0.009). In addition, the CD4 cell count was lower and the viral load marginally higher in the hepatitis B virus positive patients. The differences were however not statistically significant (p value--0.114 and 0.644 respectively). HIV-HBV co-infection in HIV positive pregnant women is not of negligible proportions as demonstrated in this study. Thus, HIV positive pregnant women should be screened for HBV and assisted to access care targeted at preventing morbidity and vertical transmission."
2903,0.002,2.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus Tat regulatory protein is essential for virus replication and for the efficient transcription of HIV-1 provirus, and in the pathogenesis of AIDS. The role of the tat gene was investigated in 300 samples. It was found that 71.7% were subtype CRF_01AE, 9.3% were subtype B, while 11.7 and 7.3% of them were cross-reactive and non-typeable, respectively. Moreover the results from peptide ELISA also showed that a low CD4 cell count was related to a low anti-Tat antibody (p < 0.05), which may be due to the progression of HIV-1, which can be found predominantly in AIDS patients. The results of nested PCR showed that the second Tat exon might also play a role in T-cell activation. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure HIV-1 mRNA expression in PBMC. RT-PCR negative results were found mostly in the asymptomatic HIV-seropositive group (88%). HIV-1 mRNA expression was found to correlate with current immunologic status. The differences in Tat protein sequences from DNA sequencing between the patients who had anti-Tat antibody positive and anti-Tat antibody negative, were not significant (p > 0.05). These results suggested that the Tat amino acid sequences were conserved among each group of samples and did not change significantly compared with the consensus sequence in previous studies. Several factors make Tat an attractive target for vaccine design."
4831,0.002,2.0000,"To better understand whether potent antiretroviral therapies can modify the natural history of HIV-1-associated microsporidiosis and cryptosporidiosis, the response to antimicrobial treatment of these opportunistic infections was evaluated in patients with or without antiretroviral treatment. Fifty patients with diarrhoea, all positive for Cryptosporidium parvum or Enterocytozoon bieneusi, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected concerning demographics, clinical and microbiological characteristics of the parasitic infection, antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Faecal samples were prepared using the Richie formalin-ethyl acetate method and stained using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for detection of Cryptosporidium parvum and Isospora belli, the modified trichrome and calcofluor white technique for detection of Enterocytozoon spp., and iodine for detection of ova, cysts or vegetative forms. Diarrhoea was defined as an abnormal increase in stool liquidity, an abnormal increase in stool frequency and a daily stool weight of more than 250 g for a period of at least 4 days. Patients treated with double antiretroviral therapy or protease inhibitors demonstrated an excellent response and a sustained therapeutic effect after follow-up (range, 5-36 months). The relapse of cryptosporidiosis in two patients who discontinued antiretroviral therapy suggests that the infection might remain in a latent stage. The resolution of the diarrhoea seems to be related to an increased CD4+ cell count rather than to the viral load. In conclusion, these data strongly support the hypothesis that combination antiretroviral therapy is able to greatly modify the course of cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis in patients infected with HIV-1."
6990,0.002,2.0000,"Injection drug use (IDU) is one of the most significant risk factors for viral hepatitis (B, D and C) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, there is little information about the risk of infection among non-injection drug users (non-IDUs). The present study was designed to perform several objectives: (a) to evaluate the prevalence of serological markers of hepatitis B, D, C virus and HIV in IDU and non-IDU patients; (b) to compare the prevalence of these markers between both groups; (c) to identify risk factors for HCV and HIV in this population; and (d) to correlate the presence of HCV and liver function. A total of 385 consecutive patients (122 IDUs and 263 non-IDUs), admitted to the Drug Dependency Treatment Unit at the Hospital Insular of Gran Canaria between 1993 to 1994, were included in the study. The serological markers of HBV, HDV, HCV and HIV were determined by ELISA and immunoblot methods. In all cases we also measured syphilis tests (RPR and FTAabs), serum aminotransferases and serum gammaglutamiltranspeptidase. Compared to the non-IDU, the IDU group presents a higher prevalence of antiHBc (55.0% vs. 20.7%, p < 0.0001), antiHCV (87.6% vs. 35.3%, p < 0.0001) and antiHIV (21.8% vs. 2.7%, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in RPR positivity (0.9% vs. 4.9%, p = 0.06). Delta infection was only detected in injection drug users, and the prevalence was low. Using logistic regression, the only risk factors associated with antiHCV positivity were injection drug addiction (OR: 9.2, 95% CI: 4.9-17.0) and antiHBc positivity (OR: 5.5, 95% CI: 3.0-9.9). Similarly, the associated risk factors for HIV were injection drug addiction (OR: 5.9, 95% CI: 2.3-15.0) and antiHBc positivity (OR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.5-9.2). However, no correlation was found between antiHCV positive and antiHIV or between these markers and RPR positivity. Patients positive for antiHCV showed significant elevations in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, when compared with patients negative for antiHCV: 65.0 vs. 39.2 U/l (p < 0.001) and 88.4 vs. 40.3 U/l (p < 0.001), respectively. We conclude that drug users have an elevated prevalence of HCV, HBV and HIV infection, even if drug use is only inhalated. On the other hand, the main risk factors associated with HCV and HIV are injection drug addiction and exposure to hepatitis B virus. Finally, in the study population, liver dysfunction is closely related to HCV infection."
5780,0.002,2.0000,"The morphologic evolution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) liver disease in 45 hepatic allograft recipients who were HBV surface-antigen positive (HBs-Ag+) at the time of liver replacement and who survived for more than 60 days was studied by routine histologic and immunocytochemical analysis of serial pathology specimens. The findings in these patients were compared to a control group of 30 individuals who were immune to the HBV (anti-HBs antibody positive), but required hepatic replacement for other reasons. Eight of the forty-five (18%) HBsAg-positive patients have no serologic evidence of HBV reinfection after transplantation. All 37 remaining patients are reinfected; 21 (47%) developed chronic active hepatitis and/or cirrhosis, 3 (7%) developed submassive necrosis, and 6 (14%) developed chronic lobular hepatitis. One patient lost her graft to chronic rejection, despite reinfection with the B virus. Four other patients (9%) developed a chronic carrier state. No long-term follow-up biopsies were available in the remaining two patients. The histologic features associated with dysfunction related to recurrent HBV infection evolved from an acute to chronic phase and were similar to hepatitis B seen in nonallografted livers. Furthermore HBV-related lesions could be separated from rejection using routine histology alone. The only exception to this conclusion was the occurrence of a peculiar HBV-related lesion in two recipients, described herein. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of viral antigens in almost all cases. Hepatic inflammation also was commonly present during HBV disease and consisted mostly of accessory cells and T lymphocytes. Analysis of the effect of major histocompatibility complex matching revealed no clear association between the number of class I or II matches or mismatches and the development, or pattern, of active hepatitis in the allograft. Peculiar pathologic alterations in several of the biopsies and failed allografts after HBV reinfection suggests that, under special circumstances, the B virus may be cytopathic."
1159,0.002,2.0000,"Rapid detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can result in improved patient care and/or faster implementation of public health preventive measures. A new rapid test, Determine (Abbott, Abbott Park, Ill.), detects HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 antibodies within 15 min by using 50 microl of serum or plasma. No specialized equipment or ancillary supplies are required, and results are read visually. A positive result is noted by the appearance of a red line. An operational control (red line) indicates proper test performance. We evaluated the Determine rapid HIV detection test with a group of well-characterized serum samples (CD4 counts and viral loads were known) and serum samples from HIV-positive individuals at field sites in Honduras and the Dominican Republic. In the field evaluations, the results obtained by the Determine assay were compared to those obtained by local in-country HIV screening procedures. We evaluated serum from 100 HIV-positive patients and 66 HIV-negative patients. All samples gave the expected results. In a companion study, 42 HIV-positive samples from a Miami, Fla., serum bank were tested by the Determine assay. The samples had been characterized in terms of CD4 counts and viral loads. Fifteen patients had CD4 counts <200 cells/mm(3), while 27 patients had CD4 counts >200 cells/mm(3). Viral loads ranged from 630 to 873,746 log(10) copies/ml. All samples from the Miami serum bank were positive by the Determine test. Combined results from the multicenter studies indicated that the correct results were obtained by the Determine assay for 100% (142 of 142) of the HIV-positive serum samples and 100% (66 of 66) of the HIV-negative serum samples. The Determine test was simple to perform and the results were easy to interpret. The Determine test provides a valuable new method for the rapid identification of HIV-positive individuals, especially in developing countries with limited laboratory infrastructures."
7211,0.002,2.0000,"The general methods used for public health surveillance of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases and of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are no different from those used for other diseases and infections. However, the methods used must be adapted to the unique epidemiology, wide variation in prevalences, and the very long incubation period of HIV infections. In addition, the severity of AIDS and the extreme social and personal implications of identifying HIV-infected persons make surveillance of AIDS cases and HIV infections much more difficult and place paramount importance on issues such as anonymity and confidentiality. Information on the occurrence of AIDS cases is essential for planning and developing the clinical and laboratory facilities needed for treatment and care of patients with the disease. However, surveillance of AIDS cases is of limited value for assessing the magnitude and future trends of the pandemic because the number of such cases detected, diagnosed, and reported reflect HIV infections that were acquired many years previously. In addition, there are significant problems associated with the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of most AIDS case-reporting systems. Routine HIV surveillance systems are being developed worldwide. Such systems must be adapted to the prevailing epidemiological situation; and the sampling methods used in populations where the prevalence of infection is very low must necessarily differ from those where it is moderate to high. Large-scale population serosurveys are very costly, and the results from such surveys may also be of limited accuracy because of serious problems of selection and participation bias. Furthermore, they may become outdated rapidly in areas where a high incidence of HIV infection occurs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2241,0.002,2.0000,"Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global problem that is more prevalent in injection drug users because they have a higher risk for acquiring both viruses. The roles of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress were examined in HIV-1- and HCV-coinfected human hepatic cells. Morphine (the bioactive product of heroin), HIV-1 Tat and the MN strain gp120 (gp120(MN)) proteins, and X4 HIV-1(LAI/IIIB) and R5 HIV-1(SF162) isolates were used to study the mechanisms of disease progression in HCV (JFH1)-infected Huh7.5.1 cell populations. HCV increased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) release and augmented production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) in Huh7.5.1 cells. Morphine preferentially affected R5-tropic, but not X4-tropic, HIV-1 interactions with Huh7.5.1 cells. HIV-1 proteins or isolates increased cytokine release in HCV-infected cells, while adding morphine to coinfected cells caused complex imbalances, significantly disrupting cytokine secretion depending on the cytokine, morphine concentration, exposure duration, and particular pathogen involved. Production of ROS, NO, and 3-NT increased significantly in HCV- and HIV-1-coexposed cells while exposure to morphine further increased ROS. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 significantly decreased oxyradicals, cytokine levels, and HCV protein levels. Our findings indicate that hepatic inflammation is increased by combined exposure to HCV and HIV-1, that the ubiquitin-proteasome system and NF-κB contribute to key aspects of the response, and that morphine further exacerbates the disruption of host defenses. The results suggest that opioid abuse and HIV-1 coinfection each further accelerate HCV-mediated liver disease by dysregulating immune defenses."
9439,0.002,2.0000,"Characteristics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strains and the host immune response against the virus are major determinants in the pathogenesis of AIDS. HIV isolates can be distinguished by their ability to infect and replicate to high titers in cells, to kill those cells, and to down-modulate the CD4 protein on the cell surface. In addition, their sensitivity to serum neutralization or enhancement of infection can be appreciated. The genetic sequences associated with these biologic and serologic properties have been localized and could eventually be helpful for antiviral therapy. These variations in properties of HIV strains appear to correlate with induction of neurologic and gastrointestinal disease by certain strains. In some cases, HIV can establish a silent, latent infection. The mechanisms involved are not well defined, but one concept involves the nef gene, which with some strains, can suppress virus replication. An important finding is that viruses recovered from individuals as they advance to disease have many properties in vitro of presumed virulence in the host, such as a wide cellular host range, cytopathicity, and resistance to the antiviral effect of Nef. The host immune response can control virus spread through antiviral antibodies or cellular immune responses. Neutralizing antibodies are not commonly found in infected individuals, suggesting that viruses ""escape"" this immune response. Instead, in some symptomatic patients, antibodies that enhance virus infection can be detected. The difference in sensitivity of a virus appears related to its envelope proteins. Cellular immune responses offer some promise in maintaining or eliminating virus infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
1768,0.002,2.0000,"The influence of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) upon hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine responses in HIV-infected individuals is unclear. After classification of vaccinees as non-responders (HBsAb <10IU/L) or responders (HBsAb >or=10IU/L) in our HIV cohort, multivariate logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with subsequent vaccine response. Of 626 participants vaccinated from 1988 to 2005, 217 (35%) were vaccine responders. Receipt of >or=3 doses of vaccine (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.24-2.70), higher CD4 count at vaccination (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.13 per 50 cells/microl increase), and use of HAART (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.56-3.62) were all associated with increased likelihood of developing a response. However, only 49% of those on HAART at last vaccination responded, and 62% of those on HAART, with CD4 count >or=350, and HIV RNA <400 copies/mL responded. Compared to those on HAART with CD4 count >or=350, those not on HAART with CD4 count >or=350 had significantly reduced odds of developing a vaccine response (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.70). While HAART use concurrent with HBV immunization was associated with increased probability of responding to the vaccine, the response rate was low for those on HAART. These data provide additional evidence of HAART benefits, even in those with higher CD4 counts, but also highlight the need for improving HBV vaccine immunogenicity."
616,0.002,2.0000,"HIV infection affected 0.06% of the Cuban population and AIDS associated tuberculosis (TB) represented 4.4% of cases in 2004. The objective of this study was to determine the survival of AIDS patients with TB. 167 individuals of both sexes and ages between 15 and 60 years old were studied; all of them were diagnosed in the Havana's Tropical Medicine Institute ""Pedro Kourí"", Cuba, between January 1st 1997 and May 31st 2005. The Kaplan-Meier's method and the Long-rank test were used for the survival, and the Cox's multivariate method to identify the variables associated with mortality by means of SPSS 9.0. 78 individuals of the total died at the end of study, 71.8% belonged to the pre highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era and 28.2% to the later period. From all deceased cases due to TB, 82.1% were diagnosed in the pre HAART era. The median survival was 41 months (CI=20-62). TB diagnosis in the pre HAART period, TB not being the first disease indicator of AIDS, suffering from candidiasis of esophagus before TB and a LTCD4+ count < 200 at the diagnosis of TB, were all independently associated with mortality. This study demonstrated the positive impact of HAART in the survival of Cuban AIDS patients with TB and also identified advanced immunodepression and opportunistic infections as predictors of mortality."
4758,0.002,2.0000,"The effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the treatment of HIV infection is usually measured by survival, CD4 lymphocyte counts, HIV-1 RNA viral load testing, and the occurrence of opportunistic infections. This pilot study sought to measure the impact of HAART treatments on a wide range of clinical outcomes and psychological variables in a sample of patients with advanced HIV infection. Seventy patients with advanced AIDS who were protease inhibitor naïve were started on HAART regimens. Patients were admitted to an AIDS inpatient unit of a long-term care facility that provides treatment and palliative care. All patients were diagnosed with AIDS, had CD4 cell counts below 300/cc(3), and had a projected survival of greater than one month. Patients were started on triple-drug HAART regimens with daily medical supervision and observation. In addition to standard clinical and laboratory markers, a series of observer-rated and self-report instruments were used to measure various physical and psychological factors (e.g., pain and symptom distress, psychological well-being, depression). Data were collected at baseline and after 1 and 3 months of HAART therapy. As expected, the CD4 count increased and viral load levels decreased significantly over the 3-month study period. In addition, patients improved significantly in body weight, and serum albumin and ferritin levels. The only psychosocial measure that improved significantly with treatment was depression. Ratings of pain intensity, physical and psychological symptom distress, and overall quality of life did not change. Of the 70 patients studied, 84.3% were still alive after the 3-month study period. Of these, 6 (8.6%) were discharged to community. However, 17 surviving patients (24.3%) had HAART regimens discontinued due to drug intolerance and 11 patients (15.7%) expired during the study period. While these data are preliminary, HAART regimens appear to have positive effects on CD4 count, HIV viral load, and several other measures of physical well-being in patients with advanced AIDS. Despite these improvements, the benefits of treatment on pain and symptom distress, and psychological well-being were less clear. In addition, treatment failure (mortality and intolerance) were not uncommon in this sample (40%). Further research is clearly necessary to better understand the benefits of HAART therapy in patients with advanced HIV infection."
3603,0.002,2.0000,"Characterization of HIV-1 from slow progressors is important to facilitate vaccine and antiviral drug development. To identify virus attenuations that may contribute to slower rates of disease progression, the full-length viral genomes from primary isolates of six slow progressing HIV-positive children were sequenced. Proviral DNA was extracted from cocultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells and used to PCR amplify, sequence, and extensively analyze the near full-length genomes and LTR regions. All primary HIV-1 isolates were HIV-1 subtype C throughout their genome, and amino acid (AA) sequence analysis revealed open reading frames for all genes. However, all isolates had at least one unusual gene/protein. For example, isolate LT5 had a 2AA insertion in the Vpr mitochondriotoxic domain. Isolate LT21 contained an additional 5AA in the C-terminus of tat exon 2, while integrase in isolate LT39 had an additional 4AA at the C-terminus. Rev from isolates LT45 and LT46 did not have the characteristic subtype C 16AA truncation, and in addition, had a further 3AA. Furthermore, altered functional domains were noted in several isolates, such as the cAMP-dependent kinase PKA phosphorylation site in Nef (LT5), a Vpr mutation involved in decreased proapoptotic activity (all isolates), and the Nef ExxxLL motif involved in the interaction with AP-1 and AP-2 (LT46). The slower HIV-1 disease progression in these six children may be attributed to altered protein functions. For example, LT46 Nef is unable to bind AP-1 and AP-2 and therefore is inactive on CD4 endocytosis. The biological relevance of these findings requires further investigation."
42,0.002,2.0000,"In order to determine phenotypic protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated resistance in HIV subtype C virus, we have synthetically constructed an HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1-C) viral backbone for use in a recombinant virus assay. The in silico designed viral genome was divided into 4 fragments, which were chemically synthesized and joined together by conventional subcloning. Subsequently, gag-protease-reverse-transcriptase (GPRT) fragments from 8 HIV-1 subtype C-infected patient samples were RT-PCR-amplified and cloned into the HIV-1-C backbone (deleted for GPRT) using In-Fusion reagents. Recombinant viruses (1 to 5 per patient sample) were produced in MT4-eGFP cells where cyto-pathogenic effect (CPE), p24 and Viral Load (VL) were monitored. The resulting HIV-1-C recombinant virus stocks (RVS) were added to MT4-eGFP cells in the presence of serial dilutions of antiretroviral drugs (PI, NNRTI, NRTI) to determine the fold-change in IC50 compared to the IC50 of wild-type HIV-1 virus. Additionally, viral RNA was extracted from the HIV-1-C RVS and the amplified GPRT products were used to generate recombinant virus in a subtype B backbone. Phenotypic resistance profiles in a subtype B and subtype C backbone were compared. The following observations were made: i) functional, infectious HIV-1 subtype C viruses were generated, confirmed by VL and p24 measurements; ii) their rate of infection was slower than viruses generated in the subtype B backbone; iii) they did not produce clear CPE in MT4 cells; and iv) drug resistance profiles generated in both backbones were very similar, including re-sensitizing effects like M184V on AZT."
6877,0.002,2.0000,"The branched DNA (bDNA) assay for hepatitis B virus (Chiron Corporation Emerville, USA) was investigated by application to HBV-infected patients in Taiwan, where the B and C genotypes of hepatitis B virus are most prevalent. The study group included sera with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and e antigen (HBeAg); Group 1 (n=70) without treatment; Group 2 (n=28) lamivudine treatment less than 3 months; Group 3 (n=73) lamivudine treatment 3-12 months; Group 4 (n=45) HBeAg-negative sera after 1 year treatment with lamivudine; control group (n=36) HBsAg-negative sera. Comparison of identical-sample results showed a significantly higher coefficient of variation for low-level HBV DNA (<100 MEq/ml) than for high-level (> or =100 MEq/ml), indicating increasing assay inaccuracy uncertainty as the sample HBV DNA concentration decreased. It is thus concluded that low-titered sera should receive special careful pipetting and processing. It was also found that using the relative luminescence of the negative control plus two standard deviations (S.D.) as a new cutoff could promote sensitivity (97.1-->97.1%, 89.3-->100%, 76.7-->84.9%, and 17.8-->22.2% in Groups 1-4, respectively) and specificity (94.4-->97.2%). In summary, the bDNA HBV assay showed only moderate assay performance for samples with low HBV DNA levels. This problem can be improved partially by choosing a new cutoff value based on the relative luminescence of the negative controls in the kit."
7580,0.002,2.0000,"The present study was designed to assess the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among hospital employees, who often contract the infection before the beginning of their employment, and to suggest a prevention strategy. The study population consisted of 2518 subjects working or studying at the two Hadassah University hospitals, on Mount Scopus and at Ein Kerem in Jerusalem. The total prevalence for anti-HBc positivity as an indicator for past or present HBV infection was 17.6%. Several variables, including country of birth, age, and duration of employment significantly affected the rate of anti-HBc positivity. The highest rates for anti-HBc+ were found in personnel of selected departments such as haemodialysis (31.8%), haematology/oncology (28.3%), and the blood bank (24.0%), after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex. Specific occupations in the hospital were associated with an increased rate of anti-HBc positivity. Thus the highest rate of HBV infection (after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex) was shown for housekeepers (32.4%) and departmental secretaries (23.6%), who take care of waste products containing blood, or who transfer vials containing blood to the hospital laboratories. By comparison, anti-HBc was positive in 17.2% of nurses, 15.6% of physicians, and only 7.8% of administrative clerks. Israel is a country of immigration, and anti-HBc rates were four times higher in employees born in countries where HBV is more endemic--for example, in north Africa and Mediterranean countries--than in employees born in western Europe or the United States. However, rate of anti-HBc + increased significantly with age as well as duration of employment in the hospital, irrespective of country of birth. These data indicate that although HBV infection often occurs in Israel before commencement of employment in the hospital, hospital employees are at significant risk for contracting HBV infection during their professional lifetime regardless of where they were born. Moreover, paramedical personnel such as housekeepers and departmental secretaries are in the highest risk group for contracting HBV. Finally, as a result of the high background of anti-HBC positivity in selected ethnic groups, mandatory screening for anti-HBc before employment in medical institutions in Israel is recommended for them, then active vaccination against HBV for employees at risk. Employees who immigrated from western Europe and the United States should be immunised without pre-vaccination screening for HBV."
325,0.002,2.0000,"The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with tuberculosis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons living in Switzerland, a country with low prevalence of tuberculous infection. We performed a nested case-control study and logistic regression. Cases (n = 239) were patients participating in the Swiss-HIV Cohort study (n = 7,103), diagnosed with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis. The rest of the cohort population was used as control. Patients from industrialized countries had a risk of tuberculosis similar to those from Switzerland (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.7-1.5); whereas the risk among patients from Eastern Europe (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.9-3.7), Brazil (OR 10.6; 95% CI 9.6-11.5), and Africa (OR 3.0; 95% CI 2.4-3.6) was markedly higher. Immune suppression, as indicated by low CD4 + cell count, was an independent risk factor for tuberculosis (OR 7.8; 95% CI 7.3-8.3 for patients with CD4 + < 50 cells.mm-3 compared to those with CD4 + > 500 cells.mm-3). Age, sex and HIV-transmission category did not appear to increase the risk of tuberculosis after adjustment for other patient characteristics. In conclusion, in countries of low prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, to originate from a country with high prevalence of tuberculosis infection and to have advanced immunodeficiency are significant risk factors for tuberculosis. They may be used to complement the tuberculin skin test in targeting patients for preventive chemotherapy."
801,0.002,2.0000,"Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is recognised as an important component of collaborative tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activities to reduce the burden of TB in people living with HIV (PLHIV). However, there has been little in the way of IPT implementation at country level. This failure has resulted in a recent call to arms under the banner title of the 'Three I's' (infection control to prevent nosocomial transmission of TB in health care settings, intensified TB case finding and IPT). In this paper, we review the background of IPT. We then discuss the important challenges of IPT in PLHIV, namely responsibility and accountability for the implementation, identification of latent TB infection, exclusion of active TB and prevention of isoniazid resistance, length of treatment and duration of protective efficacy. We also highlight several research questions that currently remain unanswered. We finally offer practical suggestions about how to scale up IPT in the field, including the need to integrate IPT into a package of care for PLHIV, the setting up of operational projects with the philosophy of 'learning while doing', the development of flow charts for eligibility for IPT, the development and implementation of care prior to antiretroviral treatment, and finally issues around procurement, distribution, monitoring and evaluation. We support the implementation of IPT, but only if it is done in a safe and structured way. There is a definite risk that 'sloppy' IPT will be inefficient and, worse, could lead to the development of multidrug-resistant TB, and this must be avoided at all costs."
1737,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are major causes of acute and chronic liver disease worldwide. Chronic infection with these viruses often leads to chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis or primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Both HBV and HCV are bloodborne viruses; however, HBV is transmitted efficiently by both percutaneous and mucosal exposures, and HCV is transmitted predominantly by percutaneous exposures. Because the relative importance of various modes of transmission of these viruses differs by country, the choice of specific prevention and control strategies depends primarily on the epidemiology of infection in a particular country. Comprehensive hepatitis B prevention strategies should include (1) prevention of perinatal HBV transmission, (2) hepatitis B vaccination at critical ages to interrupt transmission and (3) prevention of nosocomial HBV transmission. The prevention of hepatitis C is problematic because a vaccine to prevent HCV infection is not expected to be developed in the foreseeable future. From a global perspective, the greatest impact on the disease burden associated with HCV infection will most likely be achieved by focusing efforts on primary prevention strategies to reduce or eliminate the risk for transmission from nosocomial exposures (e.g. blood transfusion, unsafe injection practices) and high-risk practices (e.g. injecting drug use)."
7730,0.002,2.0000,"A cohort of 148 consecutive patients with hepatitis C virus infection were studied at the rheumatology out-patient clinic of a tertiary care teaching hospital. The diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection was supported by detection of HCV RNA in the serum. Cryoglobulin screening was done in all patients and the presence of a monoclonal component was investigated when the cryocrit was higher than 1%. Patients with lymphoproliferative disorders were further investigated. Four patients had a B lymphoproliferative disorder, which represents a prevalence of 2.7% in this cohort of patients with hepatitis C virus infection. Mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC), with cryocrit higher than 1%, was found in 16 of 148 patients (11%). It was type III MC in 13 patients and type II MC in 3. All patients who developed a B lymphoproliferative disorder had mixed cryoglobulinemia, with a monoclonal component (type II MC) in two patients and without a monoclonal component (type III MC) in the other two. The incidence of B-lymphoproliferative disorders among this cohort of patients with hepatitis C virus infection seems to be significantly increased. However, the high frequency of asymptomatic, undiagnosed HCV infection among the apparently healthy general population may decrease the true significance of this association. Systematic screening of cryoglobulin production in patients with hepatitis C virus infection might clarify whether the risk of B lymphoproliferative disorders increases when type II or type III mixed cryoglobulinemia is present."
1330,0.002,2.0000,"Tenofovir is a nucleotide acting both as an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency (HIV) reverse transcriptase and as a competitor for hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA-directed DNA polymerase. Approved worldwide in 2001, tenofovir is used as a component of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients with HIV infection. Since 2008, it has also been indicated for treatment of chronic HBV infection or HIV/HBV co-infection. The aim of the treatment consists in suppressing viral replication, thus reducing hepatic complications and improving patient survival. Furthermore, tenofovir could represent an effective therapeutic option in lamivudine-resistant HBV patients. Tenofovir is eliminated unchanged through urine via glomerular filtration (80%) and proximal tubular secretion (20%). Thus, alterations in renal clearance may interfere with tenofovir pharmacokinetics and systemic drug concentrations, modifying the therapeutic response. Hence, a renal overload of tenofovir in patients with a pre-existing kidney impairment could result in a worsening of renal function. Following a brief introduction on HBV infection and its therapeutic options, we review the latest evidence, to our knowledge, on renal toxicity of tenofovir in HBV patients and on drug management."
7547,0.002,2.0000,"The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability, validity and responsiveness of a health-related quality of life (HRQOL) instrument, the Medical Outcomes Short-Form 20-Item General Health Survey (MOS SF-20), in a sample of women with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Longitudinal data were collected on 202 HIV-infected women without AIDS who were receiving care at Kings County Hospital or SUNY Health Sciences Center, Brooklyn, New York. Internal consistency results showed acceptable reliability for the four multi-item MOS scales (role function, physical function, general health perceptions and mental health). Symptomatic patients and patients with lower Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ratings reported lower HRQOL than those who were asymptomatic or who had higher KPS scores. Patients who were older, unemployed or who had a history of injection drug use (IDU) also reported lower HRQOL than those who were younger, employed or who had no drug use history. Adjusted mean scores on the MOS role and physical functioning scales proved sensitive to differences in clinical status over time. The MOS SF-20 is a reliable and valid instrument of HRQOL for women with HIV infection. Its sensitivity to differences in clinical status over time suggest that it may be useful as an HRQOL indicator for HIV/AIDS clinical trials."

The treatment of this coinfected drug-abusing population is fraught with many problems such that clinicians and other health care providers have to determine whether patients should be treated first for drug addiction, for HIV/AIDS, or for HCV infection or simultaneously treated. These proceedings present the incidence and prevalence of coinfections with HIV and HCV in high-risk populations and discuss the underlying pathophysiology of coinfections and the problems and strategies of managing the treatment of coinfections among people who also inject illicit drugs. In addition, the expert panel recommended further research to determine the best possible treatment regimens applicable to injection drug users coinfected with HIV and HCV."
5687,0.002,2.0000,"In this AIDS commentary, Dr. Wilfert has reviewed the American experience with vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) since the closing of the 076 trial performed by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group in February 1994. The news generally is good; the rate of transmission from mother to child in nonstudy situations has been reduced when counseling and therapy are offered to pregnant women. As Dr. Wilfert emphasizes, the mechanism of the beneficial effect remains to be elucidated. More important, the resources required to insure that women have access to counseling and care need to be secured. In addition to these issues discussed by Dr. Wilfert, questions that need to be addressed include the efficacy and safety of more-potent antiretroviral agents or combinations in further reducing the risk of transmission, the optimal intervention for women who become pregnant while receiving antiretroviral therapy, the optimal postpartum management for women, and the most-effective treatment strategy for children born to infected women. The newborn child who is infected in spite of treatment of the mother potentially could receive great benefit from aggressive therapy designed to reduce the rate of viral replication and the selection of drug-resistant HIV-1. Finally, inexpensive and user-friendly methods of reducing the rate of vertical transmission in developing countries are urgently needed. Progress in reducing the prevalence of pediatric HIV-1 infection transmitted by mothers, the most common source of this infection in children, has been made, but further research and effort to insure access to care and answers to unsolved problems are necessary."
7414,0.002,2.0000,"A nosocomial Hepatitis B virus (HBV) outbreak at a paediatric onco-haematology unit was investigated using molecular biological methods to determine the origin of the infections. The National Reference Laboratory of Hepatitis Viruses received seven HBsAg positive sera from patients and one from the brother of a patient. A fragment of the preS1/preS2/S genes from all samples was amplified, the PCR products were sequenced and a rooted phylogenetic tree was constructed. All nucleotide sequences from the different patients were very similar and 6 of the 8 sequences were identical, suggesting a common origin of the infections. These sequences were closely related to those amplified from a nosocomial HBV epidemic in another hospital in Hungary. The on-scene investigation revealed several malpractices. The two hospital departments had close connections and some of the patients were treated in both institutions. Present report underlines the importance of developing screening protocols for hepatitis viruses and that of the introduction of regular training programs for health care professionals in the field of hospital hygiene."
9129,0.002,2.0000,"The replicative cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is reviewed, and currently used and investigational agents directed against the virus are discussed. The first step in the replication of HIV is selective binding of the envelope glycoprotein to CD4 receptors located on T lymphocytes. The virion is then uncoated within the cytoplasm, yielding viral genomic RNA. Reverse transcriptase uses the viral RNA as a template to form single-stranded DNA, which is duplicated to form proviral DNA through the activity of ribonuclease H. Host RNA polymerases transcribe the integrated proviral DNA into messenger RNA, and there is subsequent translation to viral proteins. After translation, further modification of precursor polyproteins is necessary to produce functional peptides. The assembled virus then buds from the cell surface and invades other cells. Targets of drug intervention in the replicative cycle include (1) binding and entry, (2) reverse transcriptase, (3) transcription and translation, and (4) viral maturation and budding. Inhibitors of binding and entry include recombinant soluble CD4, immunoadhesins, peptide T, and hypericin. Nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors include zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, and stavudine. Foscarnet, tetrahydroimidazobenzo-diazepinthione compounds, and nevirapine are some nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. Inhibitors of transcription and translation include antagonists of the tat gene and GLQ223. Castanospermine, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, and protease inhibitors interfere with viral maturation and budding. Drug combinations that have been or are being investigated include zidovudine plus interferon alfa, zidovudine plus zalcitabine, and zidovudine plus didanosine. Four agents currently have approved labeling for use against HIV infection: zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, and stavudine. Monotherapy with zidovudine remains the treatment of first choice. Although progress has been made in developing drug therapies for HIV infection, more selective and more potent drugs are urgently needed. The best approach at present is to optimize the use of available agents, continue to investigate new therapies, and educate the public about prevention."
1464,0.002,2.0000,"Dysregulation of T-cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta bearing lymphocytes and an increase in Vdelta1+ gammadelta T cells are typical features of HIV-1 infection. However, the role of gammadelta T cells remains unclear. Therefore, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 103 HIV-1-infected patients were investigated with respect to expression of Vdelta1. These results were compared to the Vdelta1 expression of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC). In contrast to healthy controls, Vdelta1+ cells dominated among both PBMC and BMMC in HIV-1-infected patients. Analysis of the coexpression of CD25, CD8, HLA-DR and CD45RO revealed a high prevalence of Vdelta1/CD45RO and Vdelta1/HLA-DR double-positive PBMC only in HIV-1-infected patients but not in healthy donors. Furthermore, analysis of the gammadelta TCR repertoire in patients infected with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HSV-2 showed that the selective enhancement of Vdelta1+ cells was restricted to HIV infection and not observed in other virus diseases. Our data provide further support for the involvement of gammadelta T cells in immunosuppression and progression of HIV infection."
1807,0.002,2.0000,"The use of exogenous cytokines is part of translational immune-antiretroviral approaches to induce immune reconstitution and possibly eliminate the persistence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in virally suppressed infected individuals on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Recently, our laboratories demonstrated that interleukin-7 (IL-7) has significant efficiency in stimulating HIV-1 replication from proviral latency in CD4+ T lymphocytes of infected patients. The authors now investigated the possible role of IL-7 in HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD). The authors demonstrated that the IL-7 receptor is expressed on both human neurons (i.e., differentiated NT2 cells) and human astrocytes, with relatively higher mRNA levels in neurons. The translational protein levels of IL-7 receptor alpha were not proportional to those of the mRNA levels in these central nervous system (CNS)-based cell types. Exogenous IL-7 was observed to only slightly down-regulate IL-7 receptor alpha expression on both neurons and astrocytes, as assayed by Western blotting. Instead of promoting survival, surprisingly, exogenous IL-7 induced neuronal apoptosis, as detected by TUNEL assays. Furthermore, IL-7 augmented neuronal apoptosis induced by HIV-1 gp120. Human apoptosis genomic microarray analyses of IL-7-treated human neurons showed up-regulated expression of proapoptotic genes: protein kinases, caspase-10, FAST kinase, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, and BCL2-antagonist of cell death. These data suggest that IL-7 leads to neuronal apoptosis by a molecular mechanism(s) that occurs via Fas-mediated activation-induced cell death. These studies may therefore not only be key in evaluating the potential use of IL-7 in vivo as a therapeutic modality, but also suggest that IL-7, which is increased endogenously in HIV-1-infected individuals late in disease, may be involved in the neuronal apoptosis demonstrated during HAD."
878,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major issue among dialysis patients. It is associated with a high risk of hepatic complication. The liver disease runs a unique clinical course in dialysis patients, as it can progress with modest hepatic inflammation and prominent fibrosis. The conventional cut-off level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for commencing antiviral therapy may prove too high and inappropriate for dialysis patients, and liver biopsy appears to be the only definitive means to establish the activity of liver disease in dialysis patients. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with a serum ALT level that is persistently greater than 30 IU/L, or 0.75-fold the upper limit of the normal level, and/or other clinical and laboratory findings that suggest active liver disease. For antiviral treatment, preliminary reports have shown that lamivudine is effective and well tolerated in dialysis patients. However, the long-term efficacy of lamivudine and its optimal effective dose in dialysis patients remain unknown. The prevention of nosocomial transmission among dialysis patients is also important. Universal precaution measures should be strictly observed and the segregation of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive hemodialysis patients should be considered. For HBV non-immune patients, the importance of HBV vaccination should not be overemphasized. Until a new generation of highly immunogenic vaccines that are proven to be safe and effective in patients with end-stage renal disease becomes available, early vaccination before the development of end-stage renal failure remains the best way to secure immunological protection against HBV infection in dialysis patients."
9295,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus may reactivate in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with direct-acting antivirals. The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in HBV + hepatitis C virus (HCV)-co-infected patients with compensated liver cirrhosis treated with paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir, dasabuvir with ribavirin. We reviewed prospectively gathered data from a national cohort of 2070 hepatitis C virus patients with compensated liver cirrhosis who received reimbursed paritaprevir/ombitasvir/r, dasabuvir with ribavirin for 12 weeks from the Romanian National Health Agency during 2015-2016. Twenty-five patients in this cohort were HBs antigen positive (1.2%); 15 untreated with nucleotide analogues agreed to enter the study. These patients were followed up: ALT monthly, serology for HBV and DNA viral load at baseline, EOT and SVR at 12 weeks. Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-co-infected patients were all genotype 1b and 52% females, with a median age of 60 years (51 ÷ 74); 76% were pretreated with peginterferon + ribavirin; 72% were with severe necroinflammatory activity on FibroMax assessment; 40% presented comorbidities; and all were HBe antigen negative. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) SVR response rate was 100%. Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA viral load was undetectable in 7/15 (47%) before therapy, and for the other 8 patients, it varied between below 20 and 867 IU/mL. Five patients (33%) presented virological reactivation (>2 log increase in HBV-DNA levels) during therapy. One patient presented with hepatitis associated with HBV reactivation, and two started anti-HBV therapy with entecavir. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) virological reactivation was present in 33% in our patients. Generally, HBV-DNA elevations were mild (<20 000 IU/mL); however, we report one case of hepatitis associated with HBV reactivation."
692,0.002,2.0000,"Given the continued high incidence of HIV infection in the United States among racial/ethnic minority young men who have sex with men (YMSM), and an appreciation that antiretroviral therapy (ART) can provide personal and public health benefits, attention is needed to enhance the detection of HIV-infected youth and engage them in medical care and support services that encourage sustained HIV treatment and suppression of viremia. Poor retention in clinical care has been associated with higher mortality, an increase in HIV RNA, and decreased CD4 cell count. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the health care utilization and health outcomes of HIV-infected racial/ethnic minority YMSM enrolled in an outreach, linkage, and retention study funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB). We hypothesized that among racial/ethnic minority YMSM, baseline CD4 counts and usage of ART are influenced by age, race, drug and alcohol use, and mental health symptoms. Overall, 155 subjects had at least a baseline CD4 count recorded at study entry. There was a low rate of ART use in this population with only one-half of the cohort with CD4 counts ≤ 350 cells/mm(3) being prescribed ART to treat their infection. However, of those youth who were started on ART, the majority (74%) did achieve undetectable viral loads (< 400 copies). Given the continued increase in cases of HIV infection among racial/ethnic minority YMSM, efforts to increase both the provision of ART and support services that encourage adherence in this population are warranted."
5146,0.002,2.0000,"In addition to chronic hepatitis, many individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) suffer from fatigue, which may compromise their health-related quality of life (HRQL). To assess systematically health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with chronic hepatitis C and to determine if any clinical, biochemical, virologic, demographic, and histologic features are associated with HRQL status. In this cross-sectional observational study, one hundred thirty patients with chronic HCV infection (HCV RNA positive by PCR) and 61 healthy controls were enrolled from a tertiary care teaching medical center. All patients and controls completed one generic HRQL questionnaire (MOS SF-36) and one liver-disease specific instrument (Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire, CLDQ). Ninety-five HCV patients and all the controls also completed a fatigue questionnaire (Chronic Fatigue Screener, CFS) and had immunologic markers determined (Cryoglobulin, Soluble IL-2 receptors, Rheumatoid Factor). We compared the HRQL of HCV-infected patients to the controls and, using data from other studies, to the general population, patients with diabetes, and patients with chronic low back pain. Patients with chronic HCV had greater HRQL impairment than healthy controls and those with type II diabetes. Fatigue was the most important symptom with negative impact on HRQL. Sixty-one percent of HCV-infected patients reported fatigue-related loss of activity. Additionally, other factors associated with HRQL were gender and histologic cirrhosis. Chronic HCV infection has a profound negative impact on patients' HRQL. Disabling fatigue is the most important factor that contributes to loss of well-being in this relatively young group of patients."

We analyzed the HBV DNA pre-C region in five members of a Turkish family. The mother presented an anti-HBe (+) CAH-B and the four children different hepatitis B virus serological and clinical profiles. The pre-C region was analyzed by cloning after DNA amplification in sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A method for rapid screening of a large number of cloned polymerase chain reaction products was developed for the presence of the most frequent pre-C mutations (G to A substitution at nucleotide position 1896 and 1899). At least 60 independent clones were tested for each patient by selective oligonucleotide hybridization using non-mutated (M0), one (M1) and two (M2) point-mutated probes. Results were confirmed by sequencing. The mutation 1896 was present in 91% of DNA clones from the mother. The same mutation was also found in 85% of the clones in the youngest child (D), but in less than 10% of the clones from children A and C. Only the pre-C wild-type strain was observed in child B. X gene deletions (3 to 20 nt) were also present in some clones from the mother and children A, B and C. No significant difference between serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells concerning the viral population was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
6934,0.002,2.0000,"Recent findings have indicated that megakaryocytes may be susceptible to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, suggesting a potential role for megakaryocytes as viral reservoirs in HIV-infected patients. We report that the megakaryocytic cell line Dami could be productively infected with the HTLV III-B strain of HIV-1, in 26 different experiments (results of 16 experiments are reported); productive infection lasted up to 30 weeks. Despite a lack of detectable surface expression of the CD4 molecule and very low levels of CD4 mRNA, between 40% and 60% of megakaryocytic cells produced viral proteins after contact with HIV-1. Neither cytopathogenic effects nor syncytial formation was observed. Production of high levels of functional viral particles was indicated by analysis of p24 protein levels, reverse transcriptase activity, ultrastructural studies, and the capacity of supernatants from infected Dami cells to infect the Molt-4 T-lymphocytic cell line. HIV-1 RNA and protein levels in infected Dami cells were enhanced by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and decreased by treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-gamma. Transient transfection of the megakaryocytic cells with various constructs of the HIV-1 promoter (LTR) linked to the luciferase reporter gene suggested that the effect of TNF-alpha was related, as in monocytic and T-cell lines, to transactivation of the enhancer region of the HIV-1 LTR. These findings indicate that signals provided by the immune system may modulate HIV-1 expression in cells of the megakaryocytic lineage."
8299,0.002,2.0000,"The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of basal core promoter (BCP) and precore gene (PC) mutations in hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates among the Nicobarese tribe and their relationship with genotypes and HBeAg status. A total of 726 blood samples were collected from two villages of the Car Nicobar Island where mass vaccination was performed in the year 2000. HBV DNA was isolated and the BCP and PC regions were amplified and sequenced directly. The samples positive for HBV DNA were tested for HBsAg, HBeAg and anti-HBe. Among the 211 and 515 samples collected from vaccinated and nonvaccinated persons, 16 and 82 were positive for HBV DNA, respectively. Among the vaccinated individuals, only 1 had a mutation in both the BCP and PC gene. Among the nonvaccinated subjects, 3 (4.5%) had an A1762T mutation, 8 (12.1%) had a G1764A mutation, 11 (16.7%) had a G1896A mutation and 4 (6.1%) had a G1899A mutation. The HBeAg-negative subjects had a significantly higher frequency of BCP and PC mutations than the HBeAg-positive subjects. The prevalence of a PC mutation was higher than that of a BCP mutation. The present study stresses the need for the continuous surveillance of subjects with BCP and PC mutations, as the mutations may contribute to the progression of liver disease."
2644,0.002,2.0000,"Control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by HLA-B27-positive subjects has been linked to an immunodominant CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response targeting the conserved KK10 epitope (KRWIILGLNK(263-272)) in p24/Gag. Viral escape in KK10 typically occurs through development of an R(264)K substitution in conjunction with the upstream compensatory mutation S(173)A, and the difficulty of the virus to escape from the immune response against the KK10 epitope until late in infection has been associated with slower clinical progression. Rare alternative escape mutations at R(264) have been observed, but factors dictating the preferential selection of R(264)K remain unclear. Here we illustrate that while all observed R(264) mutations (K, G, Q, and T) reduced peptide binding to HLA-B27 and impaired viral replication, the replicative defects of the alternative mutants were actually less pronounced than those for R(264)K. Importantly, however, none of these mutants replicated as well as an R(264)K variant containing the compensatory mutation S(173)A. In assessing the combined effects of viral replication and CTL escape using an in vitro coculture assay, we further observed that the compensated R(264)K mutant also displayed the highest replication capacity in the presence of KK10-specific CTLs. Comparisons of codon usage for the respective variants indicated that generation of the R(264)K mutation may also be favored due to a G-to-A bias in nucleotide substitutions during HIV-1 replication. Together, these data suggest that the preference for R(264)K is due primarily to the ability of the S(173)A-compensated virus to replicate better than alternative variants in the presence of CTLs, suggesting that viral fitness is a key contributor for the selection of immune escape variants."

This propensity is more pronounced in AIDS, where opportunistic parasitic infections may cause severe diarrhea, marked absorptive dysfunction, and significant risk of mortality. There are scant data regarding parasitic infections among HIV patients in the developed world; most studies and research come from povertystricken areas of South Africa, India, Iran, and the South Pacific. Although multiple infections with the same or different parasites have been reported, simultaneous infections are rare. We present the case of a 35-year-old man who developed a co-infection with Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides, simultaneously, the diagnosis being made after the judicious evaluation of a stool sample. Given the associated morbidity, prompt diagnosis and treatment are needed to avoid further complications in patients with HIV. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of triple parasitic infection in a patient with HIV. "
4282,0.002,2.0000,"Primary HIV-1 infection is a relevant period for its virological and epidemiological consequences. Most patients present a symptomatic disease that can be potentially serious, but neurological involvement during primary HIV-1 infection has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of primary HIV-1 infection patients presenting neurological symptoms and to compare them with primary HIV-1 infection patients without neurological involvement. Retrospective case-control study (1:3) comparing primary HIV-1 infection patients with and without neurological involvement enrolled in the Acute/Recent Hospital Clinic PHI Cohort between 1997 and 2016. Matching criteria included age (±10 years), gender, year of diagnosis (±4 years), and Fiebig stage. The conditional logit model was used for comparisons. Fourteen out of 463 patients (3.02%) enrolled in the Acute/Recent Hospital Clinic PHI Cohort between 1997 and 2016 presented neurological symptoms. 28.5% of cases presented as meningitis and 71.5% as meningoencephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid showed non-specific findings, including pleocytosis with lymphocyte predominance and increased protein levels. All cases required hospitalisation, whereas only 19% of the controls did. No other pathogen was identified in any case, but five patients initiated empirically antimicrobial treatment for other aetiologies until diagnosis was confirmed. CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly lower (p = 0.039) and plasmatic viral load significantly higher in the case group, compared to controls (p = 0.028). Risk factors, HIV-1 tropism, subtype distribution, and prescribed ART regimens were comparable between cases and controls. After 6 months on ART, 92% of cases had undetectable viral load, similar to controls, and CD4/CD8 ratio became also comparable between groups. All cases recovered rapidly with ART and were discharged without sequels. Neurological involvement during primary HIV-1 infection is unusual but serious, always requiring hospitalisation. Diagnosis is difficult because of the wide range of symptoms and similarities with other viral aetiologies. Neurological manifestations during primary HIV-1 infection are associated with a lower CD4/CD8 ratio and with a higher viral load than controls. Immediate ART initiation and rapid viral load decrease are required, allowing complete clinical recovery."
763,0.002,2.0000,"Abnormal kidney function is common in the course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Here, we performed a cross-sectional analysis using 399 patients within the Aquitaine cohort (a hospital-based cohort of HIV-1-infected patients receiving routine clinical management) to estimate the prevalence of proximal renal tubular dysfunction (PRTD) associated with HIV infection. These patients did not differ statistically by sociodemographics, median age, years since HIV diagnosis, AIDS stage, or median CD4 cell count from the entire 3080 patient cohort. Antiretroviral therapy was received by 352 patients, with 256 given tenofovir (TDF); 325 had undetectable HIV plasma viral load, and 26 were diagnosed with PRTD. In multivariate analysis, significant independent associations were found between PRTD and age (odds ratio (OR) 1.28 per 5-year increase), atazanavir (OR 1.28 per year of exposure), and TDF (OR 1.23 per year) treatment. Among patients having received TDF-containing regimens over a 5-year period, PRTD remained significantly associated with TDF exposure when treatment was ongoing (OR 5.22) or had been discontinued (OR 11.49). Thus, cumulative exposure to TDF and/or atazanavir was associated with an increased risk of PRTD, with concern about its reversibility in patients with HIV."
2159,0.002,2.0000,"Our previous study demonstrated the anti-apoptosis function of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vpu gene product in normal CD4+ T lymphocytes. In this study, using sequences obtained from the HIV sequence database, we compared vpu sequences from 184 preparations of various subtypes of HIV-1 from diverse geographical regions. Our analysis revealed that CRF01_AE isolates had premature stop codon mutations at the vpu gene at a much higher rate (36%) than other subtypes (0-9%). The premature stop codon mutations in vpu existed mostly at two amino acid residues: the methionine initiation codon and the boundary between the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains. The mutations at the latter site were more often detected in CRF01_AE. The higher mutation rates at vpu in CRF01_AE were confirmed by sequence comparison of polymerase chain reaction products newly obtained directly from the DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but not from the RNA from the plasma, in CRF01_AE- and subtype B-infected individuals. This finding may indicate the possibility that the more abundant population of HIV-1 CRF01_AE is able to induce apoptosis in CD4+ T lymphocytes than the populations of other subtypes."
3056,0.002,2.0000,"To evaluate the changing characteristics of HIV-associated bacteremia in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, we conducted a prospective case control study, comparing two periods of time, before (period A) and after (period B) the introduction of HAART. In total, 174 patients with bacteremia and 348 controls were studied. By comparing incidence in periods A and B, a statistically significant reduction of bacteremia, from 11.8 to 6.3/100 person-years (PY), was observed (p = .0001). Incidence of hospital-acquired bacteremia decreased from 5.8 episodes/100 PY in period A to 2.4/100 PY in period B (p = .0005). A similar trend was also observed for community-acquired episodes of bacteremia, with a value close to statistical significance. Logistic regression analysis indicated that intravenous drug abuse, central venous catheter (CVC) use, high value on APACHE III score, and neutropenia were independent risk factors for bacteremia in both the study periods. Interestingly, comparing the prevalence of bacteremia risk factors in the two study periods, we observed a significant reduction in the use of CVC (p = .04, period A versus period B) and in neutropenia (p = .04). The crude mortality rate was 31% in period A and 23% in period B (p = not significant [ns]). Logistic regression analysis indicated that an high value of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III (APACHE III) score (p < .001) predicted an increased risk of death. Analysis of prognostic factors of bacteremia did not significantly differ in both the study periods. We conclude that HAART has determined a significant reduction of the incidence and a modification of the characteristics of bacteremia. This reduced incidence may produce a substantial impact on future morbidity and health care costs of patients with HIV."
7141,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cognitive impairment, a significant cause of morbidity, affects up to 30% of HIV-infected people. Its prevalence doubled as patients began to live longer after the introduction of highly active retroviral therapy. Women are now one of the fastest growing groups with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States and Puerto Rico, but relatively little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of cognitive dysfunction in HIV-infected women. In this study the authors investigated its prevalence in a group of HIV-1-seropositive Hispanic women in Puerto Rico. Forty-nine women with a nadir CD4 cell count of < or = 500 cells/mm3 were enrolled. Cognitive impairment was defined according to the American Academy of Neurology criteria for HIV dementia as modified to identify an ""asymptomatic cognitively impaired"" group. Observed prevalence was compared with prevalence in other populations in United States, Europe, and Australia. Differences in clinical markers and neuropsychological test performance among the cohort stratified by cognitive impairment were tested. Cognitive impairment was observed in 77.6% (38/49) of cases; asymptomatic cognitive impairment in 32.7% (16/49); minor cognitive motor disorders in 16.3% (8/49); and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in 28.6% (14/49). Cognitive impairment did not correlate with age, CD4 cell count, viral load, or treatment modality. The cross-sectional prevalence of HIV-associated cognitive impairment was 77.6% (28.6% for HAD). These findings should enhance awareness of the prevalence of HIV-associated cognitive impairment, both clinically apparent and ""asymptomatic,"" in Hispanic women and lead to improvements in areas such as education and compliance and to reevaluation of treatment interventions."
8473,0.002,2.0000,"Variation in the time to AIDS and duration of survival of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected persons was recognized early in the epidemic. Recent studies have indicated that the rate of viral replication, as manifest by the number of copies of HIV RNA per milliliter of plasma, is a major determinant of outcome in an infected person. The predictive power of the measurement of plasma HIV RNA copy number is enhanced by combining this result with the CD4 lymphocyte number. The determinants of the rate of viral replication are less clearly defined. Recent studies suggest that polymorphism of the chemokine receptors, required for cellular infection, plays a role in regulating the rate of viral replication. The subsequent adaptive evolution of HIV-1 to the host's immune response is a consequence of this dynamic of the virus. Complicating opportunistic infections also appear to enhance HIV-1 replication, while antiviral therapy, in contrast, can and does suppress viral replication."
9450,0.002,2.0000,"We assessed the intralaboratory reproducibility of a system for sequencing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) by using replicate subanalyses of 46 plasma samples collected from HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral-experienced patients in order to determine the relative contributions of the different procedural steps to final sequence variability. Complete sequence concordance between duplicates of each sample was 99.4%. Complete and partial mismatches occurred scattered throughout the PR-RT genome segment at >300 positions. Approximately 75% of the discordances involved mixtures, some of which appeared at key resistance sites. Most differences were the result of the first-round RT-PCR procedure. Inter-rater concordance for sequence analysis and assembly was >99.9%. There was no observed correlation between the number or frequency of mismatches and plasma viral loads. A separate longitudinal analysis of a single routine control sample sequenced 103 times over 9 months consistently gave highly reproducible sequences (median percentage of nucleotide discordances, 0.04%; range, 0 to 0.2%). Finally, sequence data from 168 sequential samples collected from 22 patients with long-term, predominantly wild type HIV showed that intrapatient nucleotide concordance with individual index sequences ranged from 96.5 to 100%. Together, these results confirm that sequence-based genotyping can be a precise and reliable tool for monitoring HIV drug resistance, and they suggest that efforts to reduce variability should focus on the first RT-PCR step. Consequently, the data suggest that the composition of external quality assessment panels should be based on clinical HIV isolates rather than DNA clones."
5772,0.002,2.0000,"Coexistence of HIV, pulmonary sarcoidosis, and human T-cell lymphotrophic viruses (HTLV) I/II has not been well reported and studied. Although the exact etiology of sarcoidosis is unknown, immunologic abnormalities have been the focus of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related sarcoidosis and it is thought to be a manifestation of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. We report the case of an African American woman with HIV and HTLV I/II coinfection who developed pulmonary sarcoidosis several months after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Despite the fact that most common etiologies of pulmonary nodules in HIV patients include mycobacterial and fungal infections, sarcoidosis should be considered in differential diagnosis. This disease may continuously rise due to the increasing number of people who are receiving antiretroviral therapy, leading to an improved immune system."
7900,0.002,2.0000,"The number of patients who present with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease [defined as a helper lymphocyte (CD4) count <50 cells/mm3 or the presence of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness] is increasing. In the USA during 1994-1999, a relatively stable proportion of 43% of people diagnosed with HIV infection were tested late in the infection (had AIDS diagnosed within 1 year of diagnosis). A recent review of newly diagnosed infections in 2003 found that 301/977 (31%) of patients in the UK and Ireland presented late (<200 CD4 cells/mm3). Before a diagnosis is made, patients with advanced disease do not benefit from antiretroviral therapy and may continue to transmit the infection to others. Furthermore, when antiretroviral therapy is initiated in patients with CD4 counts of 201-350 cells/mm(3), the risk of death is lower than when treatment is started at lower CD4 cell counts. With the increasing prevalence of HIV in women and African immigrants, some doctors are concerned that different management approaches need to be used in these groups. This article reviews the evidence and some clinical scenarios for patients with advanced disease without complications and women and Africans who may present with advanced HIV disease. The aim is to offer practical advice on therapeutic options for treatment-naïve patients who present with advanced HIV disease on the basis of available clinical evidence."
118,0.002,2.0000,Coinfection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a substantial medical and public health concern due to its increasing prevalence and complex patient management. Alcohol use may worsen HCV-related liver disease and interfere with adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and medical care. We therefore studied the association between HCV infection and markers of HIV disease progression in adults with alcohol problems.
2719,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is known to show significant genetic diversity. There are eight HBV genotypes (A-H) characterized by distinct geographical distribution. Mutations in the HBV genome, in particular precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutations, may be important factors in the pathogenesis of disease. In this study genetic heterogeneity and phylogenetic analysis of HBV isolates from 32 naïve patients with acute HBV infection was investigated. Eleven patients presented with severe infection, while the remaining 21 had self-limiting illness. Only four isolates from patients with severe HBV infection harbored the G1896A stop codon mutation. One isolate (Irish-13), collected from a patient with acute asymptomatic infection, had a G1896A mutation and a 243 bp deletion of the polymerase gene. A triple mutation, T1753C/A1762T/G1764A was identified in only one isolate (Irish-3) associated with severe infection. The latter also had a mutation, A2339G, in the core gene, not previously reported in severe acute infection caused by genotype D. Variations within the S gene were identified in 6 isolates, including Gly145Ala, associated with vaccine immune escape, Asp144Glu, Ser143Leu and Phe134Leu, each associated with failure to detect HBsAg. Phylogenetic analysis was determined using amplicons of the S gene (678 bp) and distal-X/PC region (672 bp). Genotype A was the most common (75%), followed by genotype D (15.6%), and equal proportions of C, E, F, and H. A novel recombinant of genotypes D and E was identified in an isolate originating from West Africa. Genetic heterogeneity of HBV isolates of HBV isolates from patients with acute infection needs further study of its significance."
749,0.002,2.0000,"To date, no studies have provided data on hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevalence among asymptomatic, healthy human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I) positive carriers. This sero- and molecular epidemiology study was performed on patients in the Northeast of Iran, which is an endemic area for HTLV-I infection. A total of 109 sera were collected from HTLV-I positive healthy carriers who were admitted to Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad City. All were tested for HBV serology and subsequently, real time PCR was carried out on the samples, regardless of the results of the serology. Standard PCR and direct sequencing were applied on positive samples. All cases were negative for HBsAg, Anti-HBc, and anti-HBs were positive in 34 (31.1%), and 35 (32%) individuals, respectively. There were 19 (17.4%) cases that were positive only for anti-HBs, and they had already received HBV vaccine. 16 (15%) were positive for both anti-HBs and anti-HBc, indicating a past-resolved HBV infection. 18 (16.5%) were isolated as anti-HBc, and 56 (51.3%) were negative for all HBV serological markers. Only one subject (0.9%) had detectable HBV DNA (2153 copy/ml), and assigned as being an occult HBV infection. The low prevalence of HBsAg, despite the high percentage of anti-HBc positive cases, might be related to the suppression effect of HTLV-I on surface protein expression. The low prevalence of HBV infection among HTLV-I positive healthy carriers from an endemic region, indicates that the epidemiology of HTLV-I and HBV coinfection is related to the endemicity of HBV in that region, rather than HTLV-I endemicity."
2403,0.002,2.0000,"Polymorphic products of HLA class I genes restrict cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to the constantly evolving spectrum of HIV-1 antigens. Accordingly, homozygosity at class I loci can reduce the repertoire for such HLA-dependent interactions, leading to accelerated disease progression. To test this hypothesis we studied subjects from two distinct HIV/AIDS cohorts: 140 Dutch homosexual men and 202 Rwandan heterosexual women followed up to 13 years from HIV-1 seroconversion. We performed intermediate- and selective high-resolution molecular typing at HLA class I (A, B, and C) and high-resolution typing at HLA class II DRB1 and DQB1. Homozygosity at the HLA-A or -B locus or both was found at increasingly high frequency among individuals with successively more rapid progression to late-stage HIV-1-related conditions. In the combined cohorts (n = 342) the odds ratio (OR) due to HLA-A or -B antigen homozygosity in rapid versus slow progressors was 3.8 (p = 0.003); for Dutch men alone the OR was 3.5 (p = 0.102), and for Rwandan women the OR was 4.1 (p = 0.009). In contrast, homozygous genotypes at either HLA-C, DRB1, or DQB1 alone, or DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes, did not exert any deleterious effect on HIV-1 disease progression. These findings suggest strongly that diversity in addition to sequence specificity at HLA-A and -B loci can influence the rate of disease progression following HIV-1 infection."
5073,0.002,2.0000,"Despite the ability of current combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) to limit the progression of HIV-1 to AIDS, HIV-positive individuals continue to experience neuroHIV in the form of HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND), which can range from subtle to substantial neurocognitive impairment. NeuroHIV may also influence substance use, abuse, and dependence in HIV-positive individuals. Because of the nature of the virus, variables such as mental health co-morbidities make it difficult to study the interaction between HIV and substance abuse in human populations. Several rodent models have been developed in an attempt to study the transmission and pathogenesis of the HIV-1 virus. The HIV-1 transgenic (HIV-1Tg) rat is a reliable model of neuroHIV because it mimics the condition of HIV-infected patients on cART. Research using this model supports the hypothesis that the presence of HIV-1 viral proteins in the central nervous system increases the sensitivity and susceptibility of HIV-positive individuals to substance abuse.

1165,0.002,2.0000,"Physical function limitations have been associated with poor health outcomes, which have a negative impact on quality of life of older individuals. This study examined the association between depression, viral load, and acculturation with physical function among Latino men living with HIV. A secondary data analysis was performed using a cross-sectional data of 146 Latino immigrant men living with HIV in New York City and Washington, DC. Physical function was measured using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Uncontrolled HIV infection and depression were associated with worse physical function, thus implying the importance of adequate health care to address these conditions. Preserving physical function should start during middle adulthood, particularly among people living with HIV because of their greater risk of developing age-related challenges such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases among others. This study informs future interventions to preserve physical function and achieve the goal of successful aging."
8796,0.002,2.0000,"Notch1 plays an important role in the regulation of immune responses and epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT). Previous studies have observed inflammatory cell infiltration and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the renal biopsies from patients with HBV-associated glomerulonephritis (HBV-GN). We hypothesized that Notch1 may be involved in the progression of HBV-GN. In this study, we evaluated the distribution of Notch1 in patients with HBV-GN. Our results showed that Notch1 was mainly distributed in renal tubules and the interstitial area, and the expression levels of Notch1 had a positive correlation with the renal tubular pathology. In this respect, we used human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) as target cells, which were transiently transfected with the hepatitis B virus X (HBx) gene using a eukaryotic vector. HBx expression resulted in significantly increased detection of Notch1, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), major histocompatibility complex-II (MHC-II), CD40 and interleukin-4 (IL-4). At the same time, E-cadherin and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) expression levels were significantly inhibited. These HBx-induced phenotypes were exacerbated by upregulation of Notch1. Knock-down of Notch1 by specific shRNA caused decreases of α-SMA, MHC-II, CD40 and IL-4, and increases of E-cadherin and IFN-γ. These findings suggest that Notch1 is significantly associated with renal tubular and interstitial lesions. Notch1 can mediate HBx-induced EMT of HK-2 cells, promote HBx-induced increases in immune molecule expression and exacerbation of cytokine disorders, which may contribute to the progression of HBV-GN. Inhibitors of Notch1 signalling may be useful as new therapeutics for the treatment of HBV-GN."
5742,0.002,2.0000,"The prevalence of depression is high among injection drug users (IDUs) and among those infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Moreover, one of the drugs used in the standard treatment for HCV infection (interferon) has been known to exacerbate underlying psychiatric disorders such as depression and has been associated with the development of major depressive disorder among HCV-infected patients. For these reasons, the most recent National Institutes of Health consensus statement on the management of HCV infection recommends the identification and treatment of depression prior to the start of HCV treatment. This study aimed to examine the extent of current moderate/severe depressive symptoms in a cohort of HCV-infected IDUs as measured by two screening tools, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Subjects were participants in a multisite behavioral intervention trial among HCV-seropositive, human immunodeficiency virus-negative IDUs aged 18-35 years; the trial was designed to prevent secondary transmission of HCV and to enhance uptake of HCV treatment. Baseline data on demographics, risk behaviors, depression, alcohol use, and health care utilization were measured via audio computer-assisted self-interview. A factor analysis was conducted on each scale to examine the clustering of items used in each to measure depressive symptoms. Baseline depressive symptoms, as measured via the CES-D and the BDI, were also compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Of 193 HCV-infected individuals enrolled to date, 75.6% were male, and 65.3% were white. Median age was 25.8 years. Factor analyses revealed that these scales measured depression differently; a distinct somatic component was present in the BDI, but not the CES-D. Using cutoff scores of 23 for the CES-D and 19 for the BDI, 44.0% and 41.5% of the participants were identified as having moderate/severe depressive symptoms, respectively. Over half (56.0%) were identified as having depressive symptoms by either scale. However, there was only moderate agreement between the two scales (kappa=0.46). Depressive symptoms were highly prevalent in this cohort of HCV-infected IDUs. Results indicated that both scales should be used in tandem to have the most sensitive detection of depressive symptoms, thereby maximizing the potential for HCV treatment success."
1769,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B is one of the most important causes of chronic viral hepatitis world wide. Mutations in the precore region of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome are frequently found in hepatitis B envelope antigen-negative cases. Data from India on the HBV genotype-associated distribution of precore mutations are limited. Our objective in this study was to genotype and detect the precore mutant with a point mutation from G to A at nucleotide 1896 using ligase chain reaction (LCR) and direct sequencing. A total of 115 cases of chronic liver disease were screened. The cases were evaluated on the basis of history, clinical examination, liver function profile, and serological test for HBV infection, which includes HBsAg, anti HBcIgG, HBeAg using commercially available ELISA kits. The cases, which were HBeAg+, HBeAg-, and HBV DNA+, were subjected to LCR and confirmed by direct sequencing. Of 115 chronic liver disease cases, 50 (43.5%) cases were HBV DNA positive. All cases were subjected to LCR; 11 (22%) cases confirmed the presence of precore mutants, while the remaining 39 (78%) were classified as the wild form of the virus. HBV genotyping by direct sequencing revealed that genotype D was predominant in both wild and mutant forms of the virus. We conclude that the HBV genotype distribution was not significantly different between precore mutants and the wild form of the virus (P>0.05). North Indian patients with genotype D were more likely to have persistent HBV infection with precore mutants. HBV genotypes correlate with the clinical outcome of chronic HBV infection."
555,0.002,2.0000,"The KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa is experiencing an explosive outbreak of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C infections. Understanding the genetic diversity of C viruses and the biological consequences of this diversity is important for the design of effective control strategies. We analyzed the protease gene, the first 935 nucleotides of reverse transcriptase, and the C2V5 envelope region of a representative set of 72 treatment-naïve patients from KwaZulu-Natal and correlated the results with amino acid signature and resistance patterns. Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple clusters or ""lineages"" of HIV-1 subtype C that segregated with other C viruses from southern Africa. The same pattern was observed for both black and Indian subgroups and for retrospective specimens collected prior to 1990, indicating that multiple sublineages of HIV-1 C have been present in KwaZulu-Natal since the early stages of the epidemic. With the exception of three nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations, no primary resistance mutations were identified. Numerous accessory polymorphisms were present in the protease, but none were located at drug-binding or active sites of the enzyme. One frequent polymorphism, I93L, was located near the protease/reverse transcriptase cleavage site. In the envelope, disruption of the glycosylation motif at the beginning of V3 was associated with the presence of an extra protein kinase C phosphorylation site at codon 11. Many polymorphisms were embedded within cytotoxic T lymphocyte or overlapping cytotoxic T-lymphocyte/T-helper epitopes, as defined for subtype B. This work forms a baseline for future studies aimed at understanding the impact of genetic diversity on vaccine efficacy and on natural susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs."
9559,0.002,2.0000,"HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses limit viral replication in untreated infection. After the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), these responses decay and the infected cell population that remains is commonly considered to be invisible to T-cells. We hypothesized that HIV antigen recognition may persist in ART-treated individuals due to low-level or episodic protein expression. We posited that if persistent recognition were occurring it would be preferentially directed against the early HIV gene products Nef, Tat, and Rev as compared to late gene products, such as Gag, Pol, and Env, which have higher barriers to expression. Using a primary cell model of latency, we observed that a Nef-specific CD8+ T-cell clone exhibited low-level recognition of infected cells prior to reactivation and robust recognition shortly thereafter. A Gag-specific CD8+ T-cell clone failed to recognized infected cells under these conditions, corresponding with a lack of detectable Gag expression. We measured HIV-specific T-cell responses in 96 individuals who had been suppressed on ART for a median of 7 years, and observed a significant, direct correlation between cell-associated HIV DNA levels and magnitudes of IFN-γ-producing Nef/Tat/Rev-specific T-cell responses. This correlation was confirmed in an independent cohort (n = 18). Correlations were not detected between measures of HIV persistence and T-cell responses to other HIV antigens. The correlation with Nef/Tat/Rev-specific T-cells was attributable to Nef-specific responses, the breadth of which also correlated with HIV DNA levels. These results suggest that ongoing Nef expression in ART-treated individuals drives preferential maintenance and/or expansion of T-cells reactive to this protein, implying sensing of infected cells by the immune system. The direct correlation, however, suggests that recognition does not result in efficient elimination of infected cells. These results raise the possibility that enhancing the cytolytic activity of Nef-specific T-cells may lead to reductions in infected cell frequencies, even in the absence of therapeutic latency reversal."
464,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem, with more than 350 million people chronically infected worldwide. The chronic HBV infection in Poland is also an essential medical and social problem. Starting from 1993, a steady decline of the incidence of HBV has been observed, reaching the estimated rate of 4.5 per 100 000 in 2004. Nothing is known about the genetic variability of HBV in Poland, the occurrence and spreading of genetic variants and mutants of hepatitis B virus in the population of Polish patients during the course of the disease and in relation to antiviral treatment. It is very interesting to study the molecular epidemiology of the Polish population regarding hepatitis B virus infection as Poland is still ethnically a uniform country, with no more than 3-4% of ethnic minorities. The first results regarding distribution of HBV genotypes and serotypes in northern Poland have been published by our group in 2003 and 2004. This work was part of a scientific project supported by the Fifth Framework Programme initiative of the European Union, entitled ""Emerging variants of hepatitis B virus: new tools for epidemiological survey, diagnosis of infection, and monitoring of drug resistance"". In the course of the project more than 200 hepatitis B infected patients from the northern part of Poland have been enrolled, diagnosed and - if the viral load of HBV was suitable for analysis - genotyped by sequencing of the HBV pol/S gene fragment. This review presents the main characteristics and some interesting aspects of the studied cohort of chronically infected patients from northern Poland as well as the molecular epidemiology."
8913,0.002,2.0000,"To assess the prevalence of major drug resistance mutations in antiretroviral (ARV)-treated patients with detectable viral load (VL) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, genotypic resistance testing was performed among treated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) patients attending the University Malaya Medical Center between July 2003 and November 2004. The reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes from 36 plasma samples with detectable VL were examined for major mutations associated with ARV resistance as reported by the International AIDS Society-USA Drug Resistance Mutations Group. The prevalence of patients with at least one major mutation conferring drug resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), non-NRTIs (NNRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs) was 77.8%. In the RT gene, the frequency of mutations associated with NRTIs and NNRTIs resistance was 52.8 and 63.9%, respectively, with M184V and K103N mutations being selected most frequently by these drugs. A patient with Q151M mutation complex was also detected. Twenty-two percent of the patients had mutations associated with PIs. The following pattern of prevalence of ARV-resistant HIV-1 variants was observed: NNRTI-resistant > NRTI-resistant > PI-resistant. The prevalence of major drug resistance mutations among ARV-treated patients with detectable VL is high in Kuala Lumpur. Genotypic drug resistance testing is therefore important for monitoring patients experiencing ARV regimen failure."
4896,0.002,2.0000,"The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare both the safety and tolerability and the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses for two influenza virus subunit vaccines, one with MF59 adjuvant (Fluad) and one without an adjuvant (Agrippal), in healthy and in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected adult individuals. To achieve this aim, an open, randomized, comparative clinical trial was performed during the 2005-2006 season. A total of 256 subjects were enrolled to receive one dose of vaccine intramuscularly. Blood samples were taken at the time of vaccination and at 1 and 3 months postvaccination. A good humoral antibody response was detected for both vaccines, meeting all the criteria of the Committee for Medical Products for Human Use. After Beyer's correction for prevaccination status, Fluad exhibited better immunogenicity than Agrippal, as shown from the analysis of the geometric mean titers, with significant differences for some virus strains; however, no definitive conclusions on the clinical significance of such results can be drawn, because the method used to estimate antibody response is currently nonstandard for influenza virus vaccines. Significant induction of an antigen-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte proliferative response was detected at all time points after immunization, for both the vaccines, among HIV-1-seronegative subjects. This was different from what was observed for HIV-1-infected individuals. In this group, significance was not reached at 30 days postvaccination (T30) for those immunized with Agrippal. Also when data were compared between treatment groups, a clear difference in the response at T30 was observed in favor of Fluad (P = 0.0002). The safety profiles of both vaccines were excellent. For HIV-1-infected individuals, no significant changes either in viremia or in the CD4+ cell count were observed at any time point. The results showed good safety and immunogenicity for both vaccines under study for both uninfected and HIV-1-infected adults, confirming current recommendations for immunization of this high-risk category."
2870,0.002,2.0000,"Skin lesions are often associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, reflecting the immunocompromised status of the individual. We investigated the relationship between skin lesions and immune function in a retrospective study of 796 Chinese HIV patients with and without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Of the 651 patients who had not received HAART, we found that 531 (81.6%) had apparent skin lesions. The incidence of infectious skin diseases (fungi, viruses, bacteria, spirochetes and parasites) and non-infectious skin diseases (excluding skin cancer) was 68.8% and 34.9%, respectively. Mean CD4(+) T-cell counts and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratios were lower in patients with skin lesions than in patients without lesions (178 ± 96/µl vs. 306 ± 189/µl (p < 0.05) and 0.22 vs. 0.34 (p < 0.01), respectively). Candidiasis (25.8%), eczema (19.2%), nodular prurigo (13.8%), dermatophyte infections (10.6%) and herpes zoster (9.4%) were most common in Chinese patients with HIV. Among the 145 patients who had started HAART, there was a significantly lower prevalence of skin diseases (29.0%), although drug eruptions (12.4%) were more commonly observed. These findings indicate that HAART often reduces the incidence of infectious and non-infectious skin lesions in patients with HIV, but can itself be the cause of drug eruptions."
471,0.002,2.0000,"The objective of this study was to investigate total health care costs and time to occurrence of hospitalization in HIV-infected patients treated according to the 1998 DHHS guidelines in a managed care setting. The study also investigated which patients do not receive guideline treatment. We used a retrospective cross-sectional study design using medical and pharmacy claims data. Data from 1,791 HIV-infected patients using antiretroviral agents between 1 February 1998 and 31 July 1999, including demographic characteristics, medication guideline use, medication adherence and cost of care, were examined. Factors associated with total health care costs and time-to-inpatient admission (as a proxy for patient outcomes) were assessed. Patients receiving guideline (HAART) therapy (55%) had higher prescription and total health care costs but lower medical costs. Patients not receiving treatment according to guidelines were more likely to be female, older, have comorbidities, lower medication adherence and no AIDS-defining illness. Treatment with HAART guidelines was associated with longer time-to-inpatient admission controlling for other factors. In a short-term cross-sectional analysis, patients treated with HAART guidelines had better outcomes based on time-to-inpatient admission but higher prescription and total health care costs. Some patients are at risk for not receiving care according to national treatment guidelines and may be targeted for intervention programmes."
4405,0.002,2.0000,"Acute HIV infection is rarely recognized as the signs and symptoms are normally unspecific and can persist for days or weeks. The normal HIV course is characterized by a progressive loss of CD4+ cells, which normally leads to severe immunodeficiency after a variable time interval. The mean time from initial infection to development of clinical AIDS is approximately 8-10 years, but it is variable among individuals and depends on a complex interaction between virus and host. Here we describe an extraordinary case of a man who developed Pneumocisits jiroveci pneumonia within one month after sexual exposure to HIV-1, and then presented with 3 consecutive CD4 counts bellow 200 cells/mm³ within 3 months, with no other opportunistic disease. Although antiretroviral therapy (AZT+3TC+ATZ/r) was started, with full adherence of the patient, and genotyping indicating no primary antiretroviral resistance mutations, he required more than six months to have a CD4 restoration to levels above 200 cells/mm³ and 10 months to HIV-RNA to become undetectable."
5934,0.002,2.0000,"The purposes of this study were (a) to describe the clinical and biochemical manifestations associated with spontaneous reactivation of hepatitis B virus as defined by the reappearance of hepatitis B virus DNA in serum using dot-blot hybridization and (b) to determine whether the clinical and biochemical manifestations associated with hepatitis B virus reactivation were different in patients with and without human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection. During 1 yr, 110 French patients were admitted to Hôpital Beaujon for chronic hepatitis B. Fourteen were found to have hepatitis B virus reactivation; of these, three were anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1-positive. These 14 patients were HBsAg-positive for 60 mo (range = 6 to 180 mo). Clinical manifestations related to reappearance of hepatitis B virus DNA were present in 11 patients. HBeAg/anti-HBe status did not change in nine patients in whom hepatitis B virus reactivation would not have been recognized without hepatitis B virus DNA testing. Cirrhosis was present in nine patients. Four patients, of whom two were anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1-positive, had fulminant liver failure. Two patients died; one was anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1-positive. One patient was given an emergency transplant."
5412,0.002,2.0000,"We have investigated the frequency of resistance mutations to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 37 Korean HIV-1-infected patients, 22 of whom had experienced previous monotherapy. CD4(+) T cell counts significantly increased from 135 +/- 110/microl to 523 +/- 259/microl for 39 +/- 3 months by HAART (p < 0.0001). Over 39 +/- 3 months of HAART, 18 of 37 patients (48.6%) harbored drug resistance mutations. The most frequently observed mutation was M184V (24.3%, 9/37). Seven of 35 patients (20.0%) exposed to protease inhibitors and 2 of 11 (18.2%) exposed to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors developed resistance mutations to their respective drugs. When we measured HIV-1 RNA viral loads over 30 months of HAART in 31 patients, we found that 13 patients (41.9%) showed virological treatment failure, with viral load >400 copies/ml. In conclusion, we found that the frequency of resistance mutations to antiretroviral drugs over 30 months was high in HAART-treated patients. As the first report on resistance mutations to HAART in Korea, our data suggest that genotyping-guided treatment as well as education for compliance are required for better care."
8186,0.002,2.0000,"IL28B host genetic make-up is known to play a critical role in the outcome of genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the context of both primary infection and therapy. However, the role of IL28B in subtype 3a infection remains unclear, and has not yet been assessed in the UK population where subtype 3a is dominant. In this study, we evaluated the role of the IL28B single-nucleotide polymorphism rs8099917 in 201 patients recruited from two well-defined cohorts (from Nottingham and Oxford), treated with the standard-of-care therapy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 24 weeks. We showed that the 'favourable' IL28B gene was associated with a rapid virological response to therapy at 4 weeks (P<0.0001), but not with a sustained virological response to therapy. The median viral load at baseline, before therapy, was markedly increased in people with the 'favourable' IL28B genotype [median viral load for the TT allele, 925,961 IU ml(-1) (range 2200-21,116,965 IU ml(-1)), and for the GT or GG allele, 260,284 IU ml(-1) (range 740-7,560,000 IU ml(-1)); P = 0.0010]. Our results suggest that the host genetic response plays an important role in early viral clearance of subtype 3a virus from the blood. However, significant reservoirs of infection must persist, as viral relapse is common, even in those with the favourable host genotype."
2558,0.002,2.0000,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is implicated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related manifestations. Increased PAF synthesis has been recently detected in HIV-infected patients. In this study, we examined in naive HIV-infected patients the in vivo effects of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen, containing tenofovir-DF/emtricitabine/efavirenz, on PAF metabolism. The specific activities of PAF basic biosynthetic enzymes, PAF-cholinephosphotransferase (PAF-CPT) and lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase (lyso-PAF-AT), but also the ones of PAF-basic catabolic enzymes, PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) in leukocytes and platelets, and lipoprotein-associated-phospholipase-A(2) (LpPLA(2)) in plasma, were measured in blood samples of eight asymptomatic naive male HIV-infected patients just before and after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment. CD4 cell counts, viral load, and several biochemical markers were also measured in the same blood samples of these patients. The repeated measures ANOVA and the Pearson r criterion were used to study statistical differences and correlations-partial correlations, while linear mixed models were conducted in order to estimate association(s) between time-dependent changes in these factors. Before treatment, the activities of PAF-CPT in leukocytes and LpPLA(2) in plasma were found to be inversely correlated with CD4 cell counts and positively correlated with the viral load. After 6 months of treatment, the activities of basic PAF-biosynthetic enzymes, PAF-CPT and lyso-PAF-AT, were both reduced in leukocytes. At 6 months, PAF-AH activity was also reduced in these cells, while LpPLA(2) remained stable. The reduction of PAF-CPT occurred even from the first month, while there is a time-dependent correlation between the increase of CD4 and the decrease of both viral load and PAF-CPT of leukocytes during treatment. Apart from its classical antiretroviral activities the tenofovir-DF/emtricitabine/efavirenz regimen also exhibited favorable effects on PAF metabolism and therefore may also display beneficial effects in some HIV-related conditions, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), in which PAF is implicated."
1437,0.002,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B is still a major public health problem, aggravated by the growing phenomenon of immigration from areas with a high prevalence of infection with this virus. In the last few years, marked progress has been achieved in diagnostic methods, knowledge of the natural history of the disease and in therapeutic options, including liver transplantation, which has improved survival in these patients. These advances have been accompanied by an increase in the complexity of decision making. Six treatments have currently been approved for hepatitis B, including two interferon formulations--standard and pegylated--and four neucleos(t)ide analogs, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and telbivudine, as well as two further drugs that are used in patients coinfected with HIV, tenofovir and emtricitabine. However, none of the current treatments is able to eradicate the virus and consequently prolonged treatments are often required with the consequent risk of generating resistance. For this reason, as well as the heterogeneity of the natural history of the disease, there is a lack of consensus on the indications for treatment and the parameters in which treatment should be based, the most suitable drug or drug combination, and the criteria to be used to continue, modify or suspend treatment. Therefore, despite the enormous progress made, numerous questions remain that make the clinical management of these patients a major challenge."
4969,0.002,2.0000,"Depressive symptoms cause major impairment and may accelerate HIV progression despite the use of antiretroviral medication. The somatic symptoms criteria for HIV infection and depression partially overlap, which can make differential diagnosis challenging. Because of chronic inflammation caused by HIV infection, HIV-positive patients may develop somatic and affective-cognitive symptoms of depression. Inflammation-related depression is primarily characterized with severe somatic symptoms such as fatigue and sleep disturbance. This study sought to explore the patterns of somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms that characterize HIV-positive patients. Our specific aims were (1) to identify subtypes of depressive symptoms in a sample of HIV-positive patients; and (2) to test the subtypes' difference on inflammatory and HIV disease progression biomarkers. HIV-positive men and women (N=102) with and without depressive symptoms were randomly selected from an Italian HIV clinic. Depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), viral load (VL), CD4+, Il-6, TNF-α, and monocytes were assessed. The three subtypes formed using Latent Class Analysis (LCA) identified patients with (1) severe cognitive-affective and somatic depressive symptoms; (2) severe/moderate somatic symptoms; and (3) absent or low depressive symptoms. The subtype with severe/moderate somatic symptoms was characterized with elevated levels of Il-6 and monocytes. No difference on HIV progression biomarkers was found. The subtypes of depressive symptoms might help differentiating depressive symptoms from HIV- and inflammatory-related somatic symptoms. When present, cognitive-affective and/or somatic symptoms cause significant impairment to patients' lives and thus warrant further assessment and treatment. "
6972,0.002,2.0000,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global issue, because an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients infected with HBV is well established. Recently, it has been suggested that HBV is associated with other human cancers. However, the association between HBV and the risk of onset of hematological malignancies remains controversial. The aim of this large-scale retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the association between HBV infection and hematological malignancies. A retrospective analysis of 86,115 newly admitted patients at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital was performed. A cohort of patients previously exposed to HBV (n = 1,874) and a cohort of individuals without a positive test for anti-hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc; n = 45,118) were compared to assess the risk of hematological malignancies. Anti-HBc was positive in 61.2% cases and 54.3% controls (p = 0.0001). The risk of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and multiple myeloma was higher in the HBV-infected cohort than in the non-HBV-infected cohort. In conclusion, patients infected with HBV have a substantially increased risk of hematological malignancies."
6797,0.002,2.0000,"The immune mechanisms associated with the evolution from latent to clinically active mycobacterial coinfection in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected humans remain poorly understood. Previous work has demonstrated that macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) can develop persistent Mycobacterium bovis BCG coinfection and a fatal SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease by 4 months after BCG inoculation. In the present study, SIVmac-infected monkeys that developed clinically quiescent mycobacterial infection after BCG inoculation were followed prospectively for the reactivation of the BCG and the development of SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease. The development of clinically latent BCG coinfection in these SIVmac-infected monkeys was characterized by a change from high to undetectable levels of bacterial organisms, with or without measurable BCG mRNA expression in lymph node cells. The reactivation of clinically latent BCG coinfection and development of SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease were then observed in these SIVmac-BCG-coinfected monkeys during a 21-month period of follow-up. The reactivation of SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease in these animals coincided with a severe depletion of CD4 T cells and a loss of BCG-specific T-cell responses. Interestingly, bacterial superantigen challenge of the SIVmac-BCG-coinfected monkeys resulted in an up-regulation of clinically latent BCG coinfection, suggesting that infection with superantigen-producing microbes may increase the susceptibility of individuals to the reactivation of AIDS-related mycobacterial coinfection. Thus, reactivation of latent mycobacterial infections in HIV-1-infected individuals may result from a loss of T-cell immunity or from a superimposed further compromise of the immune system."
1691,0.002,2.0000,"Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) infections remain major public health issues globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Impairment of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity by HIV and/or TB infections may limit the host's defences against other pathogens, including the diarrheagenic protozoan Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia intestinalis, and Entamoeba histolytica. During September-December 2015 a cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence and molecular diversity of these enteric parasites among HIV- and/or TB-infected patients at a medical reference centre in Chowke district, southern Mozambique. A total of 99 stool specimens were initially screened by direct microscopy and further confirmed and characterised by molecular methods. DNA sequence analyses of the genes encoding the small subunit ribosomal RNA and the 60-kDa glycoprotein were used for the typing and sub-typing of Cryptosporidium isolates, respectively. G. intestinalis-positive isolates by real-time PCR were subsequently typed at the glutamate dehydrogenase locus. Differential diagnosis of E. histolytica/dispar was achieved by real-time PCR. G. intestinalis (8.1%) was the enteric protozoan more frequently detected, followed by Cryptosporidium spp. (7.1%), and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (6.1%). Two HIV-infected (but not TB-infected) patients harbour G. intestinalis and Cryptosporidium spp. co-infections. Two (29%) G. intestinalis isolates were successfully characterised, revealing the presence of known AII and novel BIV genotypes. Four (57%) Cryptosporidium isolates were unmistakeable assigned to C. hominis, identifying two (IbA10G2 and IdA22) sub-types. Cryptosporidium infections were not associated to diarrhoea in HIV-positive patients, probably because improved immune function in the affected individuals due to antiretroviral therapy. G. intestinalis was considered a non-opportunistic pathogen, whereas the presence of E. histolytica could not be confirmed by molecular methods. Based on their common presence in the studied clinical population, we recommend the effective diagnosis and treatment of these enteropathogens for improving the management of HIV and TB patients."
7202,0.002,2.0000,"Directly addressing HIV medication adherence and substance use together is ideal in light of the research on the complex connections between these two behaviors. This paper describes the development of a pilot program in which a combined motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy intervention was used to increase adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and reduce substance use in HIV-infected adults. The main goals of the pilot study were (1) to confirm the ability to recruit HIV-positive substance users taking HAART; (2) to demonstrate the ability to retain participants over the course of an eight-session intervention; and (3) to examine changes in substance use and HAART adherence from pretreatment to posttreatment. Twelve HIV-positive adults with a substance use disorder participated in an 8-week intervention, which consisted of weekly individual sessions with a trained therapist. Results showed that despite the small sample size, there was a significant reduction in substance use from pretreatment to posttreatment. No statistically significant differences were found for changes in HIV medication adherence, but the trends suggest the potential for positive results with a larger sample. Retention for all eight sessions of the treatment was 73.3%. Eighty percent completed the 3-month follow-up assessment. Participants reported high therapeutic alliance reflecting comfort with their therapists and in the treatment. Overall, the pilot demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the treatment. Furthermore, results suggest that this may, in fact, be an effective intervention to reduce substance use and improve HIV medication adherence."
406,0.002,2.0000,"Increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) associated with HIV-1 infection is primarily attributed to deficient T helper (Th)1 immune responses, but most people with active TB have robust Th1 responses, indicating that these are not sufficient to protect against disease. Recent findings suggest that favourable outcomes following Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection arise from finely balanced inflammatory and regulatory pathways, achieving pathogen control without immunopathology. We hypothesised that HIV-1 and antiretroviral therapy (ART) exert widespread changes to cell mediated immunity, which may compromise the optimal host protective response to TB and provide novel insights into the correlates of immune protection and pathogenesis. We sought to define these effects in patients with active TB by transcriptional profiling of tuberculin skin tests (TST) to make comprehensive molecular level assessments of in vivo human immune responses at the site of a standardised mycobacterial challenge. We showed that the TST transcriptome accurately reflects the molecular pathology at the site of human pulmonary TB, and used this approach to investigate immune dysregulation in HIV-1/TB co-infected patients with distinct clinical phenotypes associated with TST reactivity or anergy and unmasking TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after initiation of ART. HIV-1 infected patients with positive TSTs exhibited preserved Th1 responses but deficient immunoregulatory IL10-inducible responses. Those with clinically negative TSTs revealed profound anergy of innate as well as adaptive immune responses, except for preservation of type 1 interferon activity, implicated in impaired anti-mycobacterial immunity. Patients with unmasking TB IRIS showed recovery of Th1 immunity to normal levels, but exaggerated Th2-associated responses specifically. These mechanisms of immune dysregulation were localised to the tissue microenvironment and not evident in peripheral blood. TST molecular profiling categorised different mechanisms of immunological dysfunction in HIV-1 infection beyond the effects on CD4 T cells, each associated with increased risk of TB disease and amenable to host-directed therapies.

9173,0.002,2.0000,"The extent to which HIV-1 proviral DNA mutations cause clinically relevant antiretroviral resistance is still controversial. Paired plasma HIV-1 RNA and whole blood DNA were compared in patients failing HAART to investigate if the additional knowledge of archived mutations could improve the selection of potentially active drugs. Seventy-three HIV-1-infected patients with first/second HAART failure were studied before starting a new regimen based on RNA genotyping. Follow-up data after a 12-week therapy were available. DNA genotyping was retrospectively performed on stored whole blood samples and mutational profiles were compared to those from RNA. The mean number of IAS pol mutations was significantly higher in RNA (4.45 +/- 2.76) than in DNA (2.88 +/- 2.47) (P < 0.001). DNA genotyping provided a 6% increase in detection of resistance-associated mutations. Among 64/73 patients showing discordant DNA/RNA profiles, 54 (84%) also differed for predicted active drugs. 16/73 (22%) patients had >or=1 mutation revealed by DNA genotyping alone, probably affecting therapy success in 2/16. However, neither RNA/DNA discordance nor detection of isolated DNA mutations were statistically associated with outcome. In conclusion, plasma RNA remains the elective choice for HIV genotyping in patients with therapy failure, even if the detection of proviral resistance-associated mutations, not simultaneously found in RNA, is a frequent event. Therefore, in some cases DNA plus RNA genotyping might assist in choosing more accurately subsequent antiretroviral regimens."
2368,0.002,2.0000,"This study investigated the variations in some cells of the immune system, as well as the antibiotic resistance of the bacteria responsible for enteric infections among HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients in Mbouda AD LUCEM Hospital, Cameroon. A cross-sectional study was performed from September 2014 to February 2015 in 67 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive (HIV+) and 37 HIV-seronegative (HIV-) patients. Blood collected from these patients was used to perform cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) lymphocyte blood counts and a white blood cell count, as well as to measure C-reactive protein (CRP) blood by flow cytometry and perform optical and immuno-turbidimetric detection. Enteric bacteria were isolated from the stool of patients, and their antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined using agar diffusion methods. The results showed that Escherichia coli was the main pathogenic bacteria in the digestive tracts of HIV+ (85.3%) and HIV- (81.1%) patients, and infections with Klebsiella sp. were also predominant among HIV- patients (29.4%). Resistance of Klebsiella sp. to ceftriaxone (CRO; P=0.001), gentamicin (GEN; P=0.005), chloramphenicol (CHL; P=0.0004), ciprofloxacin (CIP; P=0.005) and doxycycline (DOX; P<0.0001) was significantly higher in HIV+ patients than in HIV- patients. Enterobacter sp. showed high resistance to GEN (P=0.009) and CIP (P=0.001) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Citrobacter sp. was resistant to GEN (P=0.009) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Salmonella sp. showed high resistance to CHL (P<0.0001) and DOX (P<0.0001) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Resistance of Serratia sp. to AMO (P=0.005), AMC (P=0.005) and CHL (P=0.005) was significantly higher in HIV+ patients than in HIV- patients. Lymphopenia was higher in HIV+ patients (36.8%) than in HIV- patients (2.7%). In 45.9% of the HIV- patients, the CRP rate was higher than 6mg/L compared to 16.2% in HIV+ patients. In general, bacterial multi-drug resistance in HIV+ patients (79.4%) was significantly higher (P<0.0001) than in HIV- patients (29.7%). The present study revealed that the resistance profiles of bacteria should be considered in HIV-infected patients to improve their health care."
2656,0.002,2.0000,"Postmortem cesarean sections are rare events, but modern technology is forcing society to explore the definition of viability and the legal rights of both mother and fetus that ultimately will affect the frequency and use of this rare operation. Since the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevalence rate and the number of critically ill obstetrical patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) continues to rise, it is reasonable to assume more patients and physicians may be confronted by issues concerning fetal and maternal rights and other considerations in perimortem delivery. A 33-year-old woman, at 27 weeks' gestation, with fulminant AIDS was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in respiratory distress. As her condition deteriorated the complex problem of caring for both mother and fetus emerged. A patient advisory panel explored the issues with the patient, her family, and her health care team. Eventually a peri/postmortem cesarean section was performed on the mother when she suffered an acute fatal cardiorespiratory arrest. With the prevalence of AIDS increasing and with most women not being tested prior to pregnancy, many obstetricians will be confronted with new medical and legal challenges. Establishing comprehensive medical management for the critically ill obstetrical patient and understanding the legal rights of both patients (mother and fetus) will help avoid conflicts and potentially improve survival."
666,0.002,2.0000,"El Salvador harbours one of the largest Central American human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics, but few studies have analysed it in depth. Here, we describe the presence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and HIV variants in the HIV-infected adult population in El Salvador. Dried blood spots from 119 HIV-infected antiretroviral-naive adults attended in El Salvador were collected in 2011. The TDR was assessed according to the list recommended by the WHO. HIV-1 variants were described using phylogeny. Pol sequences could be amplified in 88 patients (50.6% men), with a mean age of 35 years. Almost all (96.7%) were infected with HIV through sexual practice and 58.7% were recently diagnosed. The mean CD4(+) count was 474 cells/mm(3) and 43.1% and 15.5% of patients showed moderate (<500 CD4 cells) or severe (<200) immune suppression, respectively. HIV-1 viral load was >100 000 copies/mL in 24.7% of patients and <2000 copies/mL in 9.1%. Five samples (5.7%) harboured any TDR mutation: 2.3% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), and 1.4% for protease inhibitor (PI). All showed only one TDR single-class resistance mutation: M184I (two cases) for NRTI, K101E and K103N for NNRTI and L23I for PI. All viruses excepting one (URF_BG) belonged to subtype B. No phylogenetic TDR networks were found. In conclusion, we report a TDR prevalence of 5.7% in El Salvador, lower than in other Central American studies. Periodical studies are essential to monitor and prevent TDR emergence in low-income and middle-income regions. Also, more efforts are needed to promote early diagnosis and prevention of infection in El Salvador."
2003,0.002,2.0000,"The ability of HIV-1 to evolve resistance to antiretroviral drugs leads to treatment failure. By nucleotide sequencing of HIV-1 subtype B isolates, amino acids responsible for drug resistance have been identified. Less information is available, however, on the extent and distribution of these amino acids in HIV-1 nonsubtype B viruses circulating mainly in developing countries. More HIV-infected patients in the developing world are now using antiretroviral drugs, and hence there is a need to monitor drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 non-subtype B viruses. This study examines the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in 28 antiretroviral drug-naive HIV-1-infected Zambians. HIV-1 proviral DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The region encompassing gag p17 to env C2-V3-C3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing. Sequence analyses for drug resistance-associated mutations in th e protease and reverse transcriptase genes, and HIV-1 subtyping, were done. Overall, 92.8% of the generated sequences were HIV-1 subtype C. The generated sequences revealed only secondary associated, but no primary, drug-resistance mutations The most frequent secondary mutations in the protease and RT genes were, respectively, I93L(91.7%), L89M (79.2%), M3611V (79%, 4.2%), and R211K (70.8%), S48T (62.5%). The atypical residues M41N (3.6%) and D67A (3.6%) were detected in the RT gene. This study reveals many naturally occurring polymorphisms in HIV-1 subtype C isolates from antiretroviral drug-naive individuals. Such polymorphisms could lead to rapid treatment failure and development of drug-resistant HIV-1 mutants in individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy."
4155,0.002,2.0000,"This work was carried out to study the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, its associated risk factors and possible routes of transmission in hemodialysis patients and renal transplant recipients. Ninety five patients and 15 normal controls were included in this study. Patients were classified into 3 groups: Group I (64 hemodialysis patients), Group II (16 renal transplant recipients) and Group III (15 patients with chronic renal insufficiency on conservative treatments). Each individual was subjected to full clinical examination, estimation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), testing for antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and core antigen (anti-HBc) by modified ELISA technique. Anti-HCV was found in 87.5% of hemodialysis patients, 81.25% of renal transplant patients, 53.3% of the conservative group and in 13.3% of the control group. There was a significant correlation between the presence of anti-HCV and the duration on dialysis in groups I and II (p < 0.05), while no significant correlation was detected between HCV positive cases and the number of units of transfused blood in groups I and II (p > 0.05). Serum ALT was elevated in patients with HCV infection, but there was no significant correlation between the presence of anti-HCV and elevated ALT level among the examined groups of patients (p > 0.05). The prevalence of HCV infection was not correlated with the duration of renal transplantation and the type of immunosuppressive therapy (p > 0.05). Coinfection with HBV and HCV could occur, as previous infection with HBV was demonstrated. Anti-HBc was found in 51.8%, 66.7%, 37.5% of anti-HCV positive patients in groups I, II, II respectively. Anti-HBs was detected in 24.1% and 15.4% of anti-HCV positive in groups I and II. HBsAg was found only in 4.7% of anti-HCV positive hemodialysis."
6437,0.002,2.0000,"Immigration from developing regions to Western countries has resulted in an increased rate of non-B subtypes in the HIV population. However, it is unclear whether these HIV variants remain confined to foreigners or are already spreading among natives. Since many immigrants come from regions in which hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are endemic, HIV-hepatitis coinfection might be more frequent in newly diagnosed HIV persons. Herein, we report changes in the prevalence and distribution of HIV-1 subtypes in Madrid, Spain over the past 10 years as well as the rate of chronic HBV and HCV coinfection in 1854 newly diagnosed HIV-1 individuals. Overall 18.2% carried HIV-1 non-B subtypes, although the prevalence increased over time reaching a peak of 19.4% in the last period (2007-2010). The most common non-B variants were CRF02_AG (37%), G (12%), A (9.9%), and C (7.8%). In native Spaniards the rate of non-B subtypes increased from 1.5% in 2000-2002 to 7.2% in 2003-2006 and to 11.4% in 2007-2010 (p = 0.04). Chronic hepatitis B and C were found, respectively, in 4.2% and 8.3% of the study population. While the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B has remained fairly stable over time across distinct populations, the rate of chronic HCV infection has experienced a significant decline, mainly in native Spaniards as a result of a reduction in intravenous drug use. In summary, the prevalence of HIV-1 non-B subtypes is rising in newly diagnosed HIV-1 individuals in Spain, including the native population. In contrast, the rate of HBV coinfection remains unchanged and the rate of HCV coinfection has declined."
847,0.002,2.0000,"The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) positivity among blood donors from Chengdu, China, and to determine risk factors associated with infection. In this study, data were collected from volunteer blood donors between July 2006 and June 2007. Anti-HCV test was performed in 119,518 donors. To identify risk factors associated with HCV infections a case-control study was conducted in 305 unique HCV-seropositive blood donors and 610 seronegative donors matched for age and sex. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using logistic regression. The population attributable risk (PAR) to risk factor was estimated according to the Bruzzi's formula. The prevalence of anti-HCV positivity was 0.53% (95% CI: 0.489-0.572%). The final multivariate model included the following independent HCV risk factors: razor sharing (OR=29.16; 95% CI: 12.89-66.00), blood transfusion (OR=20.84; 95% CI: 3.76-115.45), acupuncture (OR=8.01; 95% CI: 3.16-20.30), a history of hospitalization, injections >10 years earlier, a family history of hepatitis B, dental treatment, and ear piercing. The PAR of risk factors are 68.4%, 6.3%, 14.1%, 23.1%, 29.5%, 29.3%, 38.9%, and 27.8%, respectively, and the total PAR is 98.3%. Infection with HCV among blood donors in Chengdu is associated with iatrogenic risk factors and beauty treatment-related risk. Razor sharing is an important risk factor for HCV infection. These results indicate that infection control measures in healthcare settings may reduce the burden of HCV infection and there is a need for development of effective educational programs to improve HCV knowledge among beauty culture professionals, barber cosmetologists, and the general public to avoid risk behaviors."
7065,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a serious risk as a disease that can be spread through blood transfusion. Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is defined in a patient with the presence of HBV-DNA but a lack of HBsAg in the serum and hepatocytes. OBI can be considered as a high potential risk factor for inducing post transfusion hepatitis (PTH), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cirrhosis, and reactivation of the HBV. Recently, several investigations from various regions of the world have reported PTH as well as HCC and cirrhosis among blood recipients with diseases such as thalassemia and other disorders requiring regular hemodialysis. This form of hepatitis also causes complications for individuals that are co-infected with other viruses such as HCV and HIV. Because of its extreme disease potential, OBI can be considered a high risk for PTH, HCC, and cirrhosis. Therefore, an understanding of the prevalence of OBI among blood donors is a critical strategy in most transfusion services. This review addresses the recent information regarding the prevalence of OBI worldwide, with an additional focus on Iranian blood donors."
7180,0.002,2.0000,"Identifying microbial pathogens with zoonotic potential in wild-living primates can be important to human health, as evidenced by human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and Ebola virus. Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are ancient retroviruses that infect Old and New World monkeys and apes. Although not known to cause disease, these viruses are of public health interest because they have the potential to infect humans and thus provide a more general indication of zoonotic exposure risks. Surprisingly, no information exists concerning the prevalence, geographic distribution, and genetic diversity of SFVs in wild-living monkeys and apes. Here, we report the first comprehensive survey of SFVcpz infection in free-ranging chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) using newly developed, fecal-based assays. Chimpanzee fecal samples (n = 724) were collected at 25 field sites throughout equatorial Africa and tested for SFVcpz-specific antibodies (n = 706) or viral nucleic acids (n = 392). SFVcpz infection was documented at all field sites, with prevalence rates ranging from 44% to 100%. In two habituated communities, adult chimpanzees had significantly higher SFVcpz infection rates than infants and juveniles, indicating predominantly horizontal rather than vertical transmission routes. Some chimpanzees were co-infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz); however, there was no evidence that SFVcpz and SIVcpz were epidemiologically linked. SFVcpz nucleic acids were recovered from 177 fecal samples, all of which contained SFVcpz RNA and not DNA. Phylogenetic analysis of partial gag (616 bp), pol-RT (717 bp), and pol-IN (425 bp) sequences identified a diverse group of viruses, which could be subdivided into four distinct SFVcpz lineages according to their chimpanzee subspecies of origin. Within these lineages, there was evidence of frequent superinfection and viral recombination. One chimpanzee was infected by a foamy virus from a Cercopithecus monkey species, indicating cross-species transmission of SFVs in the wild. These data indicate that SFVcpz (i) is widely distributed among all chimpanzee subspecies; (ii) is shed in fecal samples as viral RNA; (iii) is transmitted predominantly by horizontal routes; (iv) is prone to superinfection and recombination; (v) has co-evolved with its natural host; and (vi) represents a sensitive marker of population structure that may be useful for chimpanzee taxonomy and conservation strategies."
5295,0.002,2.0000,"Oral manifestations are common findings in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients and frequently influence the overall health. Oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) is strongly associated with HIV infection demonstrating its relationship with the individual's immune status and progression of immunosuppression. This study aims to retrospectively evaluate OHL in HIV patients, analyzing its incidence, demographic aspects and possible changes in clinical and epidemiological profile of the disease over 17 years. The records of 1600 HIV-infected patients were reviewed. The data were correlated and analyzed, considering HIV exposure category, age, gender, harmful habits, CD4 level, use and type of antiretroviral. OHL was observed in 215 (13.4%) patients. Most were men in the fourth decade of life, 171 (79.5%) and 112 (52,1%) respectively, but an increase in the incidence of OHL among female patients and those in the fifth decade of life was observed. Tobacco smoking was the most frequent harmful habit reported by 114 (68%) patients. OHL occurred mostly in patients with CD4 counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3 35 (55.5%). The lower incidence of OHL was found among patients using at least one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). OHL is related to CD4 count, use of ARVT and tobacco smoking and is also more prevalent in men in the fourth decade of life. These characteristics were recognized in absolute values, but when verifying the behavior over the years we noticed that the incidence of OHL is decreasing and its epidemiological characteristics changing."
9879,0.002,2.0000,"As antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has become more effective, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has emerged as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. HIV alters HCV clinical presentation, epidemiology, virology, and pathogenesis compared with HCV monoinfected individuals. The incidence of chronic and vertical HCV infection is increased, the rate of hepatic fibrosis progression is accelerated, peripheral and intrahepatic HCV RNA levels are increased, and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and cirrhosis develop more rapidly in coinfected individuals. Based on these observations, combined with the increased efficacy of ARV therapy, several societies have recommended the diagnosis and treatment of HCV in coinfected individuals. HCV treatment with nonspecific antivirals, pegylated interferon alpha (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), is more complex in coinfected individuals compared with monoinfected individuals because these regimens appear to have decreased efficacy and the incidence of complications is increased. Although new HCV-specific regimens show early promise in HCV monoinfected individuals, it is likely that these agents will be used in combination with nonspecific therapies and additional studies will be required to evaluate their efficacy in coinfected individuals."

Antibody to HIV-2 was found by enzyme immunoassay and was verified by radioimmunoprecipitation. The patient was being treated for pulmonary tuberculosis at the time of her admission to our institution. Further laboratory and clinical evaluation at our facility revealed depressed CD4 lymphocytes, oral candidiasis, and cryptococcal meningitis with indeterminate results on serologic testing for HIV type 1 (HIV-1). The biopsy specimen of a lesion in the right occipital lobe of the brain documented Toxoplasma gondii, indicating a clinical diagnosis of AIDS. To our knowledge, our study presents the first known patient with HIV-2-associated AIDS in the United States. Our patient provides further evidence that HIV-2 causes severe immunodeficiency and opportunistic infection. The condition should be suspected in the face of normal or repeatedly equivocal HIV-1 antibody test results in the presence of clinically documented AIDS."
8118,0.002,2.0000,"Invasive pneumococcal disease (PD) occurs frequently among HIV-infected patients, but it is unclear whether its manifestations and outcome are different compared to those observed among patients without HIV-1 infection. Because the immune reconstitution that accompanies antiretroviral therapy may change some of these features and because most cases of HIV- 1 infection occur in resource-poor settings of the world where access to antiretroviral agents is limited, we compared PD among patients with and without HIV-1 infection in a North American population before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The records of all pneumococcal cultures processed at this medical center over a period of 20 months were used to identify patients with invasive PD. Hospital records were reviewed for 103 of these patients (52 with and 51 without HIV-1 infection) and demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and microbiologic information was abstracted and subsequently analyzed. Despite similarities in presenting signs and symptoms, we found a higher incidence of bacteremia but a more favorable outcome with less frequent requirements for intubation and admission to intensive care units and better survival among individuals with HIV infection. Factors such as less advanced age, the presence of fewer comorbid conditions, or a less florid inflammatory response among HIV-infected individuals may account for differences in outcome of invasive PD."

Of 6022 patients, 17 (0.3%) had TMA, with unadjusted incidences per 100 person-years of 0.079 for TMA, 0.009 for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and 0.069 for hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Compared with patients without TMA, patients with TMA had lower mean CD4(+) cell counts (197 vs. 439 cells/mm(3); P=.0009) and higher mean log(10) HIV-1 RNA levels (4.6 vs. 3.3 copies/mL; P=.0001) at last follow-up and a significantly greater incidence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (82.4% vs. 55.3%; P=.025), Mycobacterium avium complex infection (17.6% vs. 3.3%; P=.018), hepatitis C (29.4% vs. 11.3%; P=.001), and death (41.2% vs. 7.4%; P<.0001). The prevalence of herpes and use of antiherpetics were slightly higher for patients with TMA, but unadjusted distributions were not statistically significant. TMA in a cohort surveyed after the introduction of HAART was rare and was associated with advanced HIV disease."
8438,0.002,2.0000,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy era, medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) have become critical issues for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). The purpose of this study was to test explanatory models of how patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction are related to medication adherence and HRQOL for PLWH. A total of 344 PLWH receiving health-care services from a federally funded clinic in the southwest USA completed a survey questionnaire about their perception of interactions with providers, their satisfaction with services, their medication adherence, and their HRQOL. Comparing four latent variable structural equation models of direct and mediated effects of patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction, the findings illustrate that the best model is one in which patient-provider interaction has a direct and positive effect on patient satisfaction, medication adherence, and HRQOL. These findings suggest that quality patient-provider interaction is a critical element of health-care services for PLWH, while patient satisfaction is an outcome measure and not a mediating factor for medication adherence and HRQOL.

1612,0.002,2.0000,"Pulmonary aspergillosis has recently been described as an emerging infection in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), but the pathological changes have not been well documented. In this autopsy study, 17 cases of AIDS-related pulmonary aspergillosis were identified from the files of two institutions. With the exception of hypersensitivity reactions, the entire spectrum of pulmonary aspergillosis was represented. Thirteen patients exhibited acute invasive aspergillosis, and seven patients had evidence of subacute or chronic invasive infection, four of whom also had areas of acute invasion. One patient had necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis as well as acute invasive infection, and one individual had saprophytic colonization of a cavity caused by previous Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) without evidence of invasive aspergillosis. The same conditions known to predispose immunocompromised individuals without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis were also identified in these patients with AIDS and included neutropenia, steroid therapy, and underlying lung disease. Additional pulmonary conditions were identified in all but one case and consisted mainly of infection or some form of chronic lung disease. In particular, half of the cases were associated with pulmonary fibrosis related to prior PCP. All cases occurred in or after 1990, confirming the perception of the recent emergence of aspergillosis in AIDS. As suggested by this study, one reason for this may be that patients with AIDS are now living long enough to develop one or more of the predisposing conditions for pulmonary aspergillosis."
9616,0.002,2.0000,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is the Lentivirus responsible for an immunodeficiency-like disease in domestic cats (Felis catus). FIV is divided into five phylogenetic subtypes (A, B, C, D, and E), based on genetic diversity. Knowledge of the geographical distribution of subtypes is relevant for understanding different disease progressions and for vaccine development. In this study, viral sequences of 26 infected cats from Rio de Janeiro, 8 undergoing treatment with zidovudine (AZT) for at least 5 years, were successfully amplified from blood specimens. gag capsid (CA), pol reverse transcriptase (RT), and env gp120 (V3-V4) regions were analyzed to determine subtypes and to evaluate potential mutations related to antiretroviral drug resistance among treated cats. Subtyping based on phylogenetic analysis was performed by the neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods. All of the sequences clustered with subtype B in the three regions, exhibiting low genetic variability. Additionally, we found evidence that the same virus is circulating in animals in close contact. The analysis of FIV RT sequences identified two new putative mutations related to drug resistance located in the RT ""finger"" domain, which has 60% identity to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sequence. Amino acid change K-->R at codons 64 and 69 was found in 25% and 37.5% of the treated animals, respectively. These signatures were comparable to K65R and K70R thymidine-associated mutations found in the HIV-1 HXB2 counterpart. This finding strongly suggests a position correlation between the mutations found in FIV and the K65R and K70R substitutions from drug-resistant HIV-1 strains."
7073,0.002,2.0000,"After notification of a case of fulminant hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a 83-year-old female resident of a nursing home to the Flemish Health Inspectorate, a seroepidemiological study and a retrospective cohort study were conducted among the 94 residents and 47 nursing staff to assess the extent of HBV transmission and to identify risk factors. Susceptible residents were vaccinated against HBV and their serological response to hepatitis B vaccination determined. From December 2002 to April 2003, five residents with acute hepatitis B infection were identified with an attack rate of 5.5% and a case fatality rate of 40%. Three other residents were identified as HBV surface antigen and e-antigen positive carrier. None of the nursing staff tested positive for acute HBV infection or HBV carriage. Diabetic patients who were exposed to a shared finger-stick device for blood sampling were 10.7 times more likely to contract an acute HBV infection (RR 10.7; 95% CI 1.3-91.3). Other potential risk factors were undergoing podiatric care and being exposed to the shared razor blade of the hairdresser. The transmission of the infection could be controlled by restricting the use of finger-stick capillary sampling devices to individual patients, assigning separate glucometers to individual patients and, implementation of standard infection-control recommendations like wearing gloves and performing hand hygiene by the nursing staff, assigning separate podiatric sets to individual patients. HBV vaccination of the residents with three doses of HBV vaccine has not induced a sufficient degree of protection. The outbreak stresses the need for appropriate and generally applied standard procedures in nursing homes to prevent bloodborne pathogens."
3877,0.002,2.0000,"Twenty-six antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), targeting five different steps in the life cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), have been approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Accordingly, HIV-1 phenotypic assays based on common cloning technology currently employ three, or possibly four, different recombinant viruses. Here, we describe a system to assess HIV-1 resistance to all drugs targeting the three viral enzymes as well as viral assembly using a single patient-derived, chimeric virus. Patient-derived p2-INT (gag-p2/NCp7/p1/p6/pol-PR/RT/IN) products were PCR amplified as a single fragment (3,428 bp) or two overlapping fragments (1,657 bp and 2,002 bp) and then recombined into a vector containing a near-full-length HIV-1 genome with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae uracil biosynthesis gene (URA3) replacing the 3,428 bp p2-INT segment (Dudley et al., Biotechniques 46:458-467, 2009). P2-INT-recombinant viruses were employed in drug susceptibility assays to test the activity of protease (PI), nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase (NRTI), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI), and integrase strand-transfer (INSTI) inhibitors. Using a single standardized test (ViralARTS HIV), this new technology permits the rapid and automated quantification of phenotypic resistance for all known and candidate antiretroviral drugs targeting all viral enzymes (PR, RT, including polymerase and RNase H activities, and IN), some of the current and potential assembly inhibitors, and any drug targeting Pol or Gag precursor cleavage sites (relevant for PI and maturation inhibitors) This novel assay may be instrumental (i) in the development and clinical assessment of novel ARV drugs and (ii) to monitor patients failing prior complex treatment regimens."

9732,0.002,2.0000,"A decade has passed since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as standard of care for HIV/AIDS patients. The success of HAART is largely dependent on almost 100% adherence to it. In this study our primary aim was to understand from patients' own perspectives and experiences what resulted in them having 100% adherence to HAART. Thus, we purposefully recruited for in-depth interviews 10 participants (7 men and 3 women) with 100% adherence to HAART (>/=6 months previous to the interviews). All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by using Giorgi's phenomenological analysis approach. The following issues emerged from the analysis: readiness to go on HAART; HAART viewed as a life-line; maintenance of 100% adherence related with willingness to live longer and healthier; optimal ongoing patient-physician relationship, better coping and/or lack of perceived side effects; and improvements in clinical condition as well as in CD4 T-cells count and viral load reinforced the motivation to continue 100% adherence. The study findings should be helpful for health professionals caring for HIV-infected individuals on HAART."
2530,0.002,2.0000,"Current therapies for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection do not provide adequate long-term control of viral replication in the majority of patients. Monotherapy with nucleoside analogs, such as lamivudine and famciclovir, is effective for short periods but results in the emergence of drug-resistant HBV in a substantial number of patients within 1 year of therapy. Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) has demonstrated clinical activity against wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV, but it is unclear whether resistance mutations will emerge after long-term therapy with this drug. To determine whether extended treatment with ADV led to the emergence of drug-resistant populations of HBV, we analyzed virus isolated from patients currently enrolled in a long-term open-label study. The reverse transcriptase domain of HBV polymerase was amplified and sequenced from patients that had received a cumulative exposure of up to 60 weeks of ADV. During our analyses, several previously unreported amino acid substitutions were observed in the reverse transcriptase domain of HBV. Importantly, none of the observed mutations occurred in more than 1 patient, nor were they associated with an adefovir-resistant phenotype in vitro. Furthermore, none of the patients from whom these mutant viruses were isolated had evidence of virologic rebound. In conclusion, these results, although based on a limited number of patients, suggest that treatment with ADV does not lead to the emergence of resistant virus after up to 60 weeks of therapy."
1618,0.001,1.0000,"In September 2006, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new guidelines calling for routine, voluntary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing for all persons aged 13-64 years in health care settings. These guidelines were motivated, in part, by mounting evidence that the traditional approach of using risk factors to identify candidates for HIV testing is inadequate. Of the 1.0-1.2 million people in the United States thought to be infected with HIV, approximately 25% remain unaware of their infection, and nearly half of all infected patients develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome < or = 1 year after testing positive for HIV. Also contributing to the change in testing guidelines was recent evidence that routine HIV testing is cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness analysis, a method of assessing health care interventions in terms of the value they confer, reports results in terms of the resources that are required for the intervention to produce an additional unit of change in health effectiveness; more economically efficient programs are those with lower cost-effectiveness ratios. This article reviews the methods and results of cost-effectiveness studies in the United States and articulates why routine, voluntary HIV testing is not only of crucial public health importance but also economically justified."

Its ability to detect p24 antibodies was compared to that of the immunoblotting test (IBT) and a commercial available competition ELISA (compELISA) employing recombinant HIV core protein. In tests on 60 serum samples the overall agreement of the inELISA and the IBT was 93.3%. Fifty-two samples were p24 antibody positive in both the inELISA and the IBT and of these 24 (46.2%) were positive in the compELISA. All compELISA positive samples were derived from healthy individuals, whereas of the 28 (53.8%) compELISA negative samples 1 was from a patient with acute HIV infection, 18 from healthy individuals and 9 from ARC/AIDS patients. The compELISA was able to distinguish among healthy persons with normal or low T-helper cell count (P = 0.048), as was the inELISA when p24 antibodies were titrated (P = 0.027). The inELISA equals IBT in specificity and sensitivity, is convenient and is very suitable for titration of p24 antibodies."
7168,0.001,1.0000,"The degree of change in the nucleotide sequence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that occurs when it is transmitted sexually from one individual to another or vertically from mother to child is unknown. Previous studies have shown that most cultured HIV-1 isolates from the same individuals differed in the entire envelope gene nucleotide sequence by up to 2%, although most isolates from unrelated individuals differed by 6-22%. To examine diversity among HIV-1 isolates from close contacts, we determined the nucleotide sequences of viruses from a family with a known epidemiologic profile, in which a woman transmitted HIV-1 heterosexually to her partner and vertically to her daughter. Direct DNA sequence analysis of primary HIV-1 isolates amplified by PCR was used to distinguish the major and minor viral sequences, termed quasispecies, to rapidly determine the predominant sequences and their phylogenetic relationships. The nucleotide sequence diversity of a major portion of the HIV-1 envelope gene was 3.7% between isolates from the woman and her heterosexual partner and 8.5% between isolates from this woman and her daughter, who had been infected for a longer period than the partner. The configuration of the phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the daughter's predominant isolate evolved from a progenitor of her mother's current strain. This study provides evidence of a continuous spectrum of sequence diversity between any two isolates ranging from those derived from the same person to those from close contacts and, ultimately, those from unrelated individuals. These data and methods can be applied to epidemiologic investigations of possible HIV-1 transmission between health care workers and their patients."
3284,0.001,1.0000,"Improvements in HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been accompanied by increasing recognition of the importance of adherence to treatment regimens for maximizing patient benefits while minimizing the emergence of drug-resistant virus. Whether clinicians should screen patients for adherence and only administer therapy to those believed likely to adhere has not been resolved. We first examine the implications of data drawn from a recent study reporting physicians' ability to predict whether patients will adhere to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or not. We then extend previously developed mathematical models of ART to include screening for adherence and focus on resulting drug resistance as well as on HIV and AIDS incidence at the population level. We show that although screening for adherence is likely to reduce the level of drug resistance compared with a policy of treating all HIV patients with HAART, rates of new HIV infections and AIDS cases in the population would likely increase unless screening accuracy is extremely (perhaps implausibly) high."
6967,0.001,1.0000,"Genetic variation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) over time is an important consideration in long-term antiretroviral therapy, in all likelihood affecting the course of HIV disease and its response to antiretroviral therapy. Viral replication persists throughout HIV disease, and viral burden is correlated with disease stage. CD4+ T-helper cells, a prime target for HIV, appear responsible for direct cellular and humoral responses to infection. HIV can be divided into three groups: nonsyncytium-inducing (NSI) isolates with low replicative capacity; high-replicative-capacity NSI isolates; and high-replicative-capacity, syncytium-inducing (SI) isolates. The SI phenotype also is associated with T-helper-cell tropism, rapid CD4+ cell count decline, and rapid HIV disease progression. In some HIV-infected individuals, SI variants evolve from NSI variants at approximate mean CD4+ cell counts of 400 to 500 cells/microliters. Appearance of SI variants may be a useful prognostic marker for decline in cell counts and more rapid progression to AIDS. However, SI variants are not required for HIV disease progression. Only about one-half of AIDS patients harbor SI variants, indicating that HIV that remains NSI can cause AIDS and death. Zidovudine resistance has been found (in ACTG 116B/117) to be an independent predictor of HIV disease progression. Zidovudine resistance and SI phenotype together are closely associated with rapid HIV disease progression."

RA improved with resolution of bony erosions and disappearance of RF, and reached complete clinical remission only in the paralytic limbs.

4141,0.001,1.0000,"Since the widespread use of the highly active antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of liver disease has increased to become a leading cause of death among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals. It can be proposed that the ability of HIV-1 to infect hepatocytes could influence liver diseases. Although the presence of HIV-1 was identified in hepatocytes from HIV-1 seropositive patients, the susceptibility of hepatocytes to HIV-1 infection in vitro remains controversial. We present evidence here that human hepatoma cells are not productively infected with CD4-dependent HIV-1 strains because of inefficient fusion related to an absence of cell surface CD4 and CXCR4. However, these cells display an increased susceptibility to infection with a CD4-independent viral isolate through an interaction with galactosyl ceramide, an alternate receptor for HIV-1. This study provides further understanding of the susceptibility of human hepatocytes to HIV-1 infection. However, in vivo investigations are recommended to consolidate these data."
9169,0.001,1.0000,"Forty-two hemophiliacs with HIV infection were treated with high-dose glycyrrhizin, Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (SNMC). The dose was 100-200 ml of SNMC in 21 patients and 400-800 ml in the other 21. The patients were divided into an asymptomatic carrier (AC) group and AIDS related-complex (ARC)/AIDS group. SNMC was administered intravenously daily for the first 3 weeks, and every second day for the following 8 weeks to the 42 HIV-infected hemophilia patients, in accordance with the protocol proposed by the Japanese National Research Committee. The CD4/CD8 ratio and CD4 positive lymphocyte counts did not change during the treatment period. However, significant improvement was noted in some cases. A slight increase in mitogenic responsiveness to phytohemagglutinin, Concanavalin A and pokeweed mitogen was noted in most patients of both groups, especially significant improvement was seen in the AC group administered over 400 ml of SNMC. Furthermore, complete improvement was noted in liver dysfunction, which has been thought to be one of the major problems for hemophiliacs treated with blood products. Thus, prophylactic administration of high-dose SNMC to HIV positive hemophiliacs who have impaired immunological ability and liver dysfunction was considered to be effective in preventing the development from AC/ARC to AIDS."

Methods A prospective nested case-control study of a cohort of patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was conducted in a tertiary medical center in Mexico City. A sample size of 206 patients was calculated. Medical history, relevant laboratory data, peripheral arterial exam, and screening ankle-brachial index tests were obtained. Results The prevalence of abnormal ankle-brachial indexes was 20% (42 patients). Patient's mean age was 44 years ±13. The majority (98.5%) were actively receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy; active smoking was reported in 55 (27%), arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus were found in 24 (12%) and 22 (11%) patients. Median time from the human immunodeficiency virus diagnosis was eight years (Interquartile range ±11); the mean CD4 count was 481, with a mean viral load of 13,557 copies (SD ± 69025.27) and 1889.18 (SD ± 9052.77) for patients with normal and abnormal ankle-brachial index and a median of 40 (IQ ± 2). Viral load ( p = 0.04) and number of years with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( p = 0.04) were significantly associated with abnormal ankle-brachial indexes. Conclusions Abnormal ankle-brachial index seems to be more frequent in Mexican patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when compared with the general population at the same age. The most important factors associated with arterial disease were the viral load and the number of years with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."
2226,0.001,1.0000,"In this study, we investigated the causes of death and the factors associated with mortality in a cohort of patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in Burkina Faso, an African country with limited resources. This retrospective cohort study included patients aged 15 years and older who started HAART for the first time between January 2003 and December 2008 in 14 health districts. We used survival analyses, including the Kaplan-Meier method, to examine potential predictors of death and two Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios for death, first from baseline covariates and then from time-dependent covariates. A total of 6641 patients initiated HAART during this period; of these, 5608 were included in the analysis. By the end of the study period, 4310 of those patients were still receiving HAART, 690 had died, 207 had been transferred and 401 were lost to follow-up. The median duration of follow-up was 23.2 months [interquartile range (IQR): 12.4-36.9], and the overall incidence of mortality was 6 per 100 person-years. The clinical stage, CD4 count, body mass index (BMI), haemoglobin level, HAART regimen, gender, age, profession and year of initiation were the primary risk factors associated with death. In the multivariate analysis, BMI, clinical stage, treatment regimen and CD4 count remained significantly associated with death. The most frequent causes of death were wasting syndrome, tuberculosis and anaemia. This result highlights the already advanced stage of immunodeficiency among patients in Burkina Faso when they start HAART. Testing patients for HIV and starting antiretroviral therapy earlier are necessary to further reduce the mortality of patients living with HIV. This study provides a solid evidence base with which future evaluations of HAART in Burkina Faso can be compared."
9605,0.001,1.0000,"In order to evaluate the relationship between protease inhibitor (PI) plasma concentrations and viral suppression in individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), plasma concentrations and area under the time concentration curve (AUC(0.5-4)) for 35 HIV-infected adults receiving their initial (or first salvage) nelfinavir- (NFV) or indinavir (IDV)-based HAART were studied. Two groups were evaluated: those who had achieved HIV-RNA suppression (HIV-RNA <500 copies/mL, group 1, n=21) and those who had achieved incomplete HIV-RNA suppression (HIV-RNA>500 copies/mL, group 2, n=14) at the time of study entry. NFV one-hour pre-dose concentrations were significantly higher in group 1 compared to group 2 (P=0.023). The NFV AUC(0.5-4) for group 1 approached significance (P=0.068). No significant differences in IDV concentrations or AUC(0.5-4) were found between group 1 and group 2. It is feasible to use PI drug level monitoring in the outpatient setting."
2916,0.001,1.0000,"To assess the impact of chronic viral liver disease (CVLD) on hospital admissions and death in HIV-infected patients since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, all hospital charts, from January 1996 to December 2000, in a large HIV/AIDS reference center in Madrid were reviewed. Discharge diagnosis, complications during the inpatient period, and number and causes of death were recorded. A total of 1334 hospital admissions involving 875 HIV-infected individuals was recorded. Up to 82% of them were either active or former intravenous drug users. Overall, 158 (11.8%) were admitted because of complications of CVLD, or developed complications of CVLD during their admission for another reason. The absolute number and proportion of admissions caused by CVLD increased over time, from 9.4% (31 of 330) in 1996 to 16% (46 of 287) in 2000 (p < 0.05). Likewise, the total number and proportion of deaths due to CVLD increased from 9.3% (5 of 54) in 1996 to 45% (9 of 20) in 2000 (p < 0.05). Chronic hepatitis C was the only etiology in nearly three-quarters of patients who were admitted or died of CVLD. In conclusion, the proportion of hospital admissions caused by liver failure in HIV-infected patients has increased in the last 5 years, accounting for 16% of cases in 2000. End-stage liver disease currently represents 45% of causes of in-hospital death among HIV-infected individuals. Therefore, strategies to prevent infection by hepatitis viruses (hepatitis B vaccine) and specific treatment (interferon plus ribavirin for hepatitis C virus) should be encouraged among HIV-infected persons."
9138,0.001,1.0000,"Our objective was to describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of total and unbound darunavir and ritonavir concentrations in HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients with cirrhosis, as ritonavir-boosted darunavir is mainly metabolized in the liver, and hepatic cirrhosis might modify darunavir-ritonavir concentrations. This was a prospective, case-control, and unicenter study. HIV-HCV-coinfected patients with compensated cirrhosis (cases) and HIV-monoinfected patients with normal liver function (controls) were included. Darunavir-ritonavir was given at 800/100 mg once daily. Patients were followed for 24 weeks to assess safety and efficacy. A steady-state 12-h PK study was performed. Total and unbound concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The unbound fraction was obtained by ultrafiltration. The plasma area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and oral clearance (CL/F) were assessed by noncompartmental models. Thirty patients (20 cases and 10 controls) were included. Among cirrhotic patients, the Child-Pugh score was C in 4 cases, B in 1 case, and A in 15 cases; the median (interquartile range) transient elastography values were 20 kPa (14 to 26 kPa), and 5 patients had prior clinical decompensations. There were no significant differences in the darunavir PK parameters between cases and controls except for longer time to maximum plasma concentrations (Tmax) and half-lives in the cirrhotic patients. There were no significant differences in ritonavir total concentrations, but the unbound concentrations were higher in cirrhotic patients. There were significant correlations between the darunavir total and unbound concentrations in both cirrhotic patients and controls. There were no differences in PK parameters based on Child-Pugh score, liver elasticity, gender, or use of concomitant medications. In conclusion, in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients with clinically compensated cirrhosis receiving darunavir-ritonavir at 800/100 mg once daily, the darunavir total and unbound concentrations are similar to those observed in noncirrhotic patients, and dose adjustments are not necessary.

4771,0.001,1.0000,"During 4 year period between April 1990 and March 1994, 4120 specimens from the patients attending out patient departments of Medical, Surgical and Antenatal units of a major city hospital were tested for HIV infection as a part of an on-going sentinel surveillance programme. In addition, 1440 specimens from the patients attending STD clinic of the same hospital and 862 females seeking termination of pregnancy from a near by hospital were included for comparison. It was found that only 3 individuals with high risk behaviours out of 2002 females attending antenatal clinic showed evidence of HIV infection (rate 1.49 per 1000). The corresponding rate for the group of patients attending STD clinic and seeking termination of pregnancy were 3 out of 1440 (rate 2.15 per 1000) and 1 out of 862 (rate 1.16 per 1000) respectively. It was noted that prevalence of HIV infection in the hospital attending population with unspecified risk factor (medical, surgical and antenatal clinics) was not a matter of serious concern. The importance of finding out risk factors in females attending antenatal clinic is evident from the study."
9059,0.001,1.0000,"To enhance immunity induced by DNA vaccination against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), we evaluated the efficacy of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), an adjuvant of bacterial origin. BALB/c mice were intramuscularly injected with immunogenic DNA, encoding the env and rev genes of the HIV-1(IIIB) strain, formulated with MPL dissolved in different vehicles (MPL in stable emulsion and MPL in aqueous formulation). The sera from mice immunized with the two preparations of MPL revealed 2(6) to 2(9) times higher HIV-1-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers than the sera from mice immunized without MPL. In virus neutralization tests for HIV-1(IIIB), by p24 assay and antifusion assay of infected MOLT-4 cells, MPL tends to elicit antibody more protective than antibody elicited without adjuvant. MPL also elicited stronger delayed-type hypersensitivity and cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte activity against HIV-1(IIIB) compared to DNA alone. HIV-1-specific IgG subclass analysis showed that MPL tends to facilitate IgG2a production, suggesting enhancement of a predominant T-helper-type-1 response, and this enhancement may help to facilitate protective-antibody induction. Furthermore, a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay was employed to determine whether MPL affected the gene expression process. Interestingly, both MPL preparations reduced CAT activity in the muscle injected with CAT expression vector but increased anti-CAT antibody production. These results indicate that MPL acts as an effective adjuvant for immunogenic DNA injection despite reduced expression of encoding protein in muscle. We conclude that MPL has a strong adjuvant effect on DNA vaccination against HIV-1."
9850,0.001,1.0000,"The pathogenic role of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for glomerulonephritis (GN) is not clear. The frequency of HBsAg has been studied in sera of 732 consecutive patients who have glomerular diseases by using radioimmunoassay. The frequency of HBs antigenemia was 11.9%, which was not different from that in the general population of South Korea. Of the 87 HBsAg seropositive patients with GN, 29 cases with membranoproliferative GN (MPGN) and eighteen with membranous nephropathy (MN) were diagnosed as having HBV-associated nephropathy. Eighty-seven and one-half percent of the adults with MPGN and 80% of the children with MN were HBsAg carries. The morphologic findings and laboratory data in cases with HBV-associated MPGN and MN did not differ significantly from those observed in patients with MPGN and MN without circulating HBsAg. Yet mesangial deposits were more frequently noted in patients with HBV-associated MN when compared to others with idiopathic MN. Glomerular deposits of HBsAg were not detected using indirect immunofluorescence technique. Even though HBsAg was not demonstrable within the glomeruli, HBV infection seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of MPGN in Korean adults and MN in children."
3887,0.001,1.0000,"Cellular immunity plays an important role in the long-term control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We studied the changes in HBV-specific CD4 T cell immunity after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for chronic hepatitis B under antiviral prophylaxis. T cell proliferation and interferon-gamma production in response to in vitro challenge with HBV-encoded antigens were tested in 40 OLT recipients without HBV recurrence and in 12 OLT recipients with HBV recurrence more than 1 year after transplantation, and they were compared to 40 subjects with chronic HBV infection and to 23 subjects with self-limited HBV infection. The frequency and magnitude of the HBV-specific CD4 T cell response were significantly lower in 40 OLT recipients with HBV clearance, but the T cell reactivity to mitogen (phytohemagglutinin) and recall antigen (tetanus toxoid) was maintained. In the 12 OLT recipients with HBV recurrence, however, the HBV-specific T cell immunity was enhanced to a level comparable to that of patients with chronic hepatitis B, and the level was dependent on the serum viral load. In conclusion, HBV-specific CD4 T cell immunity is antigen-driven and evanesces with viral clearance, hence providing a favorable milieu for reactivation once prophylaxis is withdrawn. The cellular immunity in recipients with recurrence is not significantly different from that of individuals with chronic hepatitis B."
9332,0.001,1.0000,"The interrelationship among expression patterns of hepatitis B surface and core antigens (HBsAg and HBcAg) in the liver, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in sera, HBeAg/anti-HBe status and histological features was examined in 189 liver specimens and 106 sera from Japanese patients with chronic HBV infection, utilizing immunoperoxidase methods and a spot hybridization technique. HBsAg and HBcAg were distributed uniformly among the lobules in 8 viral carriers with ""normal"" liver (NVC) and 30 patients with persistent hepatitis (PB) seropositive for HBcAg. This uniform staining pattern was quite distinct from the non-uniform and irregular patterns in 137 patients with chronic active hepatitis (CAH) associated with or not associated with cirrhosis. HBcAg was often found to be stained strongly in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus of hepatocytes in HBeAg-positive CAH, in contrast to NVC/PH, in which cytoplasmic HBcAg was very weak. Serum HBV DNA was detected in all 22 cases with HBeAg-positive NVC/PH, 41 of 46 (89.1%) cases with HBeAg-positive CAH, 6 of 23 (26.1%) casew with anti-HBe-positive CAH and none of 3 cases with anti-HBe-positive NVC/PH. The level of serum HBV DNA and staining of HBcAg were in decreasing order in these groups. While the presence of serum HBV DNA and HBcAg staining was always associated with HBeAg seropositivity in NVC/PH, this was not always found in CAH. Moreover, necroinflammatory activity in the liver did not always parallel viral replication in CAH. These findings seem to confirm that NVC/PH and CAH have different biologic processes; viral replication is always concordant in the former, but is sometimes discordant in the latter with HBeAg/anti-HBe status. The immunologic response of the host seems to suppress and distort replication of the virus to a varying degree among patients and areas of the same liver in CAH differently to that in NVC/PH. The different life cycle of the virus, including integration of viral DNA into the cellular genome, may subsequently result in discordant states of various virus markers in CAH."
9629,0.001,1.0000,"Acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections either resolve or progress to chronicity. Identification of early deviations in host-virus responses associated with these outcomes can further differentiate cause-effect mechanisms that initiate and maintain chronicity. Neonatal woodchucks were infected experimentally with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) at 3 days of age. At 8 or 14 weeks of age (i.e. , the early- or mid-acute stage of infection), whole blood and large surgical biopsies of the liver were obtained from infected animals and uninfected controls. These were stored for later correlating histopathologic responses and viral load with the subsequently determined outcome of infection. As of 1 year postinfection, half of the surgically treated infected woodchucks had developed self-limited infections, while the other half developed chronic infections. The self-limited outcome was characterized by decreased viral load in acute-phase liver and plasma and a generally robust acute hepatic inflammatory response. Comparisons at the same early time points revealed that the chronic outcome was characterized by increasing initial viral load in liver and plasma, and a detectable, but diminished, acute hepatic inflammation. These cotemporal comparisons indicate that there is an early host-response deviation during the acute phase of a developing chronic infection. Continued analysis of the tissues banked from this study will facilitate further temporal characterization of acute-phase mechanisms that determine resolution versus chronicity in WHV infection. Understanding such mechanisms may be useful in the rational design of therapy for established chronic HBV infection."
6067,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with adverse liver outcomes. The clinical impact of previous HBV infection on liver disease in HCV infection is unknown. We aimed at determining any association of previous HBV infection with liver outcomes using antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb) positivity as a marker of exposure. The Scottish Hepatitis C Clinical Database containing data for all patients attending HCV clinics in participating health boards was linked to the HBV diagnostic registry and mortality data from Information Services Division, Scotland. Survival analyses with competing risks were constructed for time from the first appointment to decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related mortality. Records of 8513 chronic HCV patients were included in the analyses (87 HBcAb positive and HBV surface antigen [HBsAg] positive, 1577 HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative, and 6849 HBcAb negative). Multivariate cause-specific proportional hazards models showed previous HBV infection (HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative) significantly increased the risks of decompensated cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01-1.65) and HCC (HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.09-2.49), but not liver-related death (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.80-1.30). This is the largest study to date showing an association between previous HBV infection and certain adverse liver outcomes in HCV infection. Our analyses add significantly to evidence which suggests that HBV infection adversely affects liver health despite apparent clearance. This has important implications for HBV vaccination policy and indications for prioritization of HCV therapy."
6966,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) expresses two structural forms of the nucleoprotein, the intracellular nucleocapsid (hepatitis core antigen [HBcAg]) and the secreted nonparticulate form (hepatitis e antigen [HBeAg]). The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of HBcAg- and HBeAg-specific genetic immunogens to induce HBc/HBeAg-specific CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell immune responses and the potential to induce liver injury in HBV-transgenic (Tg) mice. Both the HBcAg- and HBeAg-specific plasmids primed comparable immune responses. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were important for priming/effector functions of HBc/HBeAg-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. However, a unique two-step immunization protocol was necessary to elicit maximal CTL priming. Genetic vaccination did not prime CTLs in HBe- or HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice but elicited a weak CTL response in HBcAg-Tg mice. When HBc/HBeAg-specific CTLs were adoptively transferred into HBc-, HBe-, and HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice, the durations of the liver injury and inflammation were significantly greater in HBeAg-Tg recipient mice than in HBcAg-Tg mice. Importantly, liver injury in HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice was similar to the injury observed in HBeAg-Tg mice. Loss of HBeAg synthesis commonly occurs during chronic HBV infection; however, the mechanism of selection of HBeAg-negative variants is unknown. The finding that hepatocytes expressing wild-type HBV (containing both HBcAg and HBeAg) are more susceptible to CTL-mediated clearance than hepatocytes expressing only HBcAg suggest that the HBeAg-negative variant may have a selective advantage over wild-type HBV within the livers of patients with chronic infection during an immune response and may represent a CTL escape mutant."
5656,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is of increasing public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa with the rollout of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Such data are, however, limited in Kenya, where HIV-1 drug resistance testing is not routinely performed. From a population-based household survey conducted between September and November 2012 in rural western Kenya, we retrospectively assessed HIV-1 TDR baseline rates, its determinants, and genetic diversity among drug-naïve persons aged 15-59 years with acute HIV-1 infections (AHI) and recent HIV-1 infections (RHI) as determined by nucleic acid amplification test and both Limiting Antigen and BioRad avidity immunoassays, respectively. HIV-1 pol sequences were scored for drug resistance mutations using Stanford HIVdb and WHO 2009 mutation guidelines. HIV-1 subtyping was computed in MEGA6. Eighty seven (93.5%) of the eligible samples were successfully sequenced. Of these, 8 had at least one TDR mutation, resulting in a TDR prevalence of 9.2% (95% CI 4.7-17.1). No TDR was observed among persons with AHI (n = 7). TDR prevalence was 4.6% (95% CI 1.8-11.2) for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 6.9% (95% CI 3.2-14.2) for non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and 1.2% (95% CI 0.2-6.2) for protease inhibitors. Three (3.4% 95% CI 0.8-10.1) persons had dual-class NRTI/NNRTI resistance. Predominant TDR mutations in the reverse transcriptase included K103N/S (4.6%) and M184V (2.3%); only M46I/L (1.1%) occurred in the protease. All the eight persons were predicted to have different grades of resistance to the ARV regimens, ranging from potential low-level to high-level resistance. HIV-1 subtype distribution was heterogeneous: A (57.5%), C (6.9%), D (21.8%), G (2.3%), and circulating recombinant forms (11.5%). Only low CD4 count was associated with TDR (p = 0.0145). Our findings warrant the need for enhanced HIV-1 TDR monitoring in order to inform on population-based therapeutic guidelines and public health interventions."
1370,0.001,1.0000,"Several studies have reported that the prevalence of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is significantly overrepresented in patients affected by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), thus suggesting that besides the well-established link with essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, a possible role for HCV is determining the development of at least some types of B-cell NHL. Such an association, however, seems to be limited to geographic areas where the presence of HCV is more relevant or endemic. According to a multistep pathogenetic model based on a large series of clinical, immunological, histological, and molecular evidences, an HCV antigen-driven polyclonal B-cell lymphoproliferation could be the initial phase of a process leading, in a variable time, into a true clonal disease. Particular genetic and environmental backgrounds could play a role in the development of a malignant phenotype, while specific HCV genotypes do not seem to be relevant in this setting. Hepatitis C virus correlated with NHL often shows some distinctive clinicopathological features, such as older age, liver damage, presence of monoclonal gammopathy (often with no clinically relevant cryoglobulinemic and/or rheumatoid activity), increased rate of autoimmune disorders, extranodal localizations, and restricted histological subtypes. Overall, the clinical outcome of HCV-positive NHL does not seem to be different from that of NHL patients without HCV infection. However, the evidence of a significant hepatic injury may predict a worse prognosis in these subjects."
3097,0.001,1.0000,"We have studied 18 participants in phase I/II clinical trials of recombinant gp120 (rgp120) subunit vaccines (MN and SF-2) who became infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) during the course of the trials. Of the 18 individuals, 2 had received a placebo vaccine, 9 had been immunized with MN rgp120, and seven had been immunized with SF-2 rgp120. Thirteen of the 18 infected vaccinees had received three or four immunizations prior to becoming infected. Of these, two were placebo recipients, six had received MN rgp120, and five had received SF-2 rgp120. Only 1 of the 11 rgp120 recipients who had multiple immunizations failed to develop a strong immunoglobulin G antibody response to the immunogen. However, the antibody response to rgp120 was transient, typically having a half-life of 40 to 60 days. No significant neutralizing activity against the infecting strain was detected in any of the infected individuals at any time prior to infection. Antibody titers in subjects infected despite vaccination and in noninfected subjects were not significantly different. Envelope-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses measured after infection were infrequent and weak in the nine vaccinees who were tested. HIV-1 was isolated successfully from all 18 individuals. Sixteen of these strains had a non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) phenotype, while two had a syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype. NSI strains used the CCR5 coreceptor to enter CD4+ cells, while an SI strain from one of the vaccinees also used CXCR4. Viruses isolated from the blood of rgp120 vaccinees were indistinguishable from viruses isolated from control individuals in terms of their inherent sensitivity to neutralization by specific monoclonal antibodies and their replication rates in vitro. Furthermore, genetic sequencing of the env genes of strains infecting the vaccinees did not reveal any features that clearly distinguished these viruses from contemporary clade B viruses circulating in the United States. Thus, despite rigorous genetic analyses, using various breakdowns of the data sets, we could find no evidence that rgp120 vaccination exerted selection pressure on the infecting HIV-1 strains. The viral burdens in the infected rgp120 vaccine recipients were also determined, and they were found to be not significantly different from those in cohorts of placebo-vaccinated and nonvaccinated individuals. In summary, we conclude that vaccination with rgp120 has had,to date, no obvious beneficial or adverse effects on the individuals we have studied."
6576,0.001,1.0000,"Previous studies have identified gaps in hepatitis B care. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the delivery of care among a national cohort of US veterans with chronic hepatitis B infection and examine risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Veterans Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse from 1999 to 2013 to evaluate (1) care delivery and (2) clinical outcomes such as hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic decompensation, and mortality among US veterans with hepatitis B. Incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and Cox regression models were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. We identified 21,419 veterans with a positive hepatitis B surface antigen, and 97% of patients had alanine aminotransferase and 44% had hepatitis B virus DNA testing; hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B e antibody were tested <50% of the time. Patients receiving specialty care had a higher prevalence of recommended laboratory testing. Patients with elevated alanine aminotransferase in specialty care were more likely to receive antiviral therapy (50% versus 24% for specialty care versus no specialty care, P < 0.001). Among patients with cirrhosis, 69% received one-time liver imaging. The proportion of follow-up time adherent to annual imaging was 0.39 (standard deviation = 0.42), and the proportion was 0.28 (standard deviation = 0.33) for biannual imaging; both proportions were higher in the specialty care group (all P < 0.05). Antiviral therapy (hazard ratio = 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.76-0.95, P = 0.005) and liver imaging (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.76-0.91, P < 0.001) were independently associated with decreased mortality in adjusted analyses."
6725,0.001,1.0000,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27-positive subjects are uncommon in their ability to control infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, late viral escape from a narrowly directed immunodominant Gag-specific CD8(+) T-lymphocyte (CTL) response has been linked to AIDS progression in these individuals. Identifying the mechanism of the immune-mediated control may provide critical insights into HIV-1 vaccine development. Here, we illustrate that the CTL escape mutation R(264)K in the HLA-B27-restricted KK10 epitope in the capsid resulted in a significant defect in viral replication in vitro. The R(264)K variant was impaired in generating late reverse transcription products, indicating that replication was blocked at a postentry step. Notably, the R(264)K mutation was associated in vivo with the development of a rare secondary mutation, S(173)A, which restored viral replication in vitro. Furthermore, infectivity of the R(264)K variant was rescued by the addition of cyclosporine A or infection of a cyclophilin A-deficient cell line. These data demonstrate a severe functional defect imposed by the R(264)K mutation during an early step in viral replication that is likely due to the inability of this variant to replicate efficiently in the presence of normal levels of cyclophilin A. We conclude that the impact of the R(264)K substitution on capsid structure constrains viral escape and enables long-term maintenance of the dominant CTL response against B27-KK10, providing an explanation for the protective effect of HLA-B27 during HIV infection."
1211,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the brain is associated with neurological manifestations both in adults and in children. The primary target for HIV-1 infection in the brain is the microglia, but astrocytes can also be infected. We tested 26 primary HIV-1 isolates for their capacity to infect human fetal astrocytes in culture. Eight of these isolates, independent of their biological phenotype and chemokine receptor usage, were able to infect astrocytes. Although no sustained viral replication could be demonstrated, the virus was recovered by coculture with receptive cells such as macrophages or on stimulation with interleukin-1beta. To gain knowledge into the molecular events that regulate attachment and penetration of HIV-1 in astrocytes, we investigated the expression of several chemokine receptors. Fluorocytometry and calcium-mobilization assay did not provide evidence of expression of any of the major HIV-1 coreceptors, including CXCR4, CCR5, CCR3, and CCR2b, as well as the CD4 molecule on the cell surface of human fetal astrocytes. However, mRNA transcripts for CXCR4, CCR5, Bonzo/STRL33/TYMSTR, and APJ were detected by RT-PCR. Furthermore, infection of astrocytes by HIV-1 isolates with different chemokine receptor usage was not inhibited by the chemokines SDF-1beta, RANTES, MIP-1beta, or MCP-1 or by antibodies directed against the third variable region or the CD4 binding site of gp120. These data show that astrocytes can be infected by primary HIV-1 isolates via a mechanism independent of CD4 or major chemokine receptors. Furthermore, astrocytes are potential carriers of latent HIV-1 and on activation may be implicated in spreading the infection to other neighbouring cells, such as microglia or macrophages."

In this study, a novel strategy has been developed to induce HIV-1-specific immune responses, which involves inactivated HIV-1-caputring concanavalin A (Con A)-immobilized nanospheres (HIV-NS) and their interaction with bone marrow (BM)-derived dendritic cells. HIV-NS were taken up by dendritic cells via cytoskeleton-dependent but mannose-binding site-independent phagocytosis. Serial stimulations to unprimed T-cells with HIV-1 gp120-capturing NS-pulsed dendritic cells could induce antigen-specific T-cell response. Intranasal administration of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled nanospheres (NS) in mice proved that the particles were taken up into pulmonary dendritic cells. Analysis of mice receiving intranasal immunizations with HIV-NS revealed that the mice efficiently induced the antibodies against HIV-1 in the genital tract and specific cytotoxic T-cells in the spleen. These results suggest that the use of HIV-1-NS may provide a novel and promising approach for the induction of humoral and cellular immune responses to HIV-1."
8903,0.001,1.0000,"Feline immunodeficiency virus infects the CNS and results in predictable pathophysiology strikingly similar to that seen with HIV-1 infection of humans. The observed pathophysiology is mimicked in several physiologically assessed modalities, further supporting the validity of the feline model. Peripheral and control evoked potential findings and the occurrence of the sleep architecture changes in both cat and human disease provide an intriguing focus for further investigation. Although structurally diverse in an absolute sense, FIV and HIV-1 share basic structural features and commonalities of their life cycle. It is likely that by understanding the common mechanisms by which these lentiviruses influence CNS function, a more complete understanding of the neurological deficits seen in HIV-1 infected patients will be obtained. The cat model is particularly valuable for study of CNS disease, since it allows detailed analyses of events during the acute phase of infection, under circumstances in which the nature and timing of the infection are carefully controlled. The availability of molecular clones for mutational analysis will facilitate mapping of genomic regions critical to the perturbation of CNS function. It is suggested that development of intervention strategies in the cat model will yield treatment modalities directly applicable to HIV-1 infection of humans."
9519,0.001,1.0000,"Aging with HIV poses unique and complex challenges, including avoidance of neurocognitive disorder. Our objective here is to identify the prevalence and predictors of successful cognitive aging (SCA) in a sample of older adults with HIV. One hundred three HIV-infected individuals aged 50 and older were recruited from the Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic in Italy. Participants were treated with combination antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year and had suppressed plasma HIV viral load. SCA was defined as the absence of neurocognitive impairment (as defined by deficits in tasks of episodic learning, information processing speed, executive function, and motor skills) depression, and functional impairment (instrumental activities of daily living). In cross-sectional analyses, odds of SCA were assessed in relation to HIV-related clinical data, HIV-Associated Non-AIDS (HANA) conditions, multimorbidity (≥2HANA conditions), and frailty. A frailty index was calculated as the number of deficits present out of 37 health variables. SCA was identified in 38.8% of participants. Despite no differences in average chronologic age between groups, SCA participants had significantly fewer HANA conditions, a lower frailty index, and were less likely to have hypertension. In addition, hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, p = .04), multimorbidity (OR = 0.35, p = .05), and frailty (OR = 0.64, p = .04) were significantly associated with odds of SCA. Frailty is associated with the likelihood of SCA in people living with HIV. This defines an opportunity to apply knowledge from geriatric population research to people aging with HIV to better appreciate the complexity of their health status."

Seventy-six participants with HIV who were on follow-up management at three non-governmental care and treatment agencies in south western, Nigeria were asked to complete a questionnaire detailing their demographic characteristics, duration of awareness of HIV status, medication status, membership of a support group, HIV-related knowledge (including number of workshops/seminars attended, reading of literature), and attitude toward their illness and treatment. Compared to those who did not belong to a support group, (34, 45%), those who did (42, 55%) were significantly more knowledgeable about HIV-related (t=4.02, p=0.00) and also reported more favorable attitudes toward the illness and its treatment (t=3.38, p=0.005). A multiple regression analysis indicated that group membership and a longer period of awareness of HIV infection contributed significantly to illness knowledge and attitudes. Age, sex, years of education, medication status, and employment status did not contribute significantly to these outcome variables. Individuals living with HIV/AIDS who belonged to a support group and had availed themselves of relevant literature were more knowledgeable and positive about their illness than those who did not belong to support groups. HIV/AIDS support group membership is an important component of psycho-social care in HIV/AIDS patients in Nigeria and should be encouraged."
4386,0.001,1.0000,"Implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has deeply changed the landscape of HIV-associated malignancies. Some AIDS-defining tumors, namely Primitive Lymphoma of Central Nervous System, have drastically declined, whereas a steady increase has been observed for non-AIDS-defining tumors, maybe due to longer survival of HIV-infected people. Easier immune restoration, subsequent to availability of a number of drugs targeting HIV at different points, has decreased opportunistic infections which hampered treatment of HIV-associated cancers. As a matter of fact these patients have been assimilated more and more with their negative counterpart, undergoing the same aggressive approach. Consistently, procedures that have been so far precluded to HIV+ subjects, such as transplant of hemopoietic stem cells, either autologous or allogenic, and liver transplant are expected to be performed more and more extensively in this population. Which also would mean a full removal of the stigma which has weighed on it. Hence, it is true-like that malignancies and related problems may in the next future make up a main concern for the HIV specialist. Old and new challenges might be the drug-drug interaction of antiretrovirals or biotherapy-related infections or the debated question of an earlier HAART implementation in the course of HIV disease, with CD4+ cells > 500/μl. In fact, if assimilation of HIV patients with cancer and the general population is a remarkable achieved goal, uniqueness of HIV infection in terms of immune status still makes HIV-associated cancer a unique chapter in the setting of Oncology."
311,0.001,1.0000,"Atazanavir is the first once-daily protease inhibitor for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection and should be used only in combination therapy, as part of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. In addition to being the most potent protease inhibitor in vitro, atazanavir has a distinct cross-resistance profile that does not confer resistance to other protease inhibitors. However, resistance to other protease inhibitors often confers clinically relevant resistance to atazanavir. Currently, atazanavir is not a preferred protease inhibitor for initial HAART regimens. In treatment-naive patients, atazanavir can be given as 400 mg/day. However, atazanavir should be pharmacologically boosted with ritonavir in treatment-experienced patients or when coadministered with either tenofovir or efavirenz. Patients who receive atazanavir experience similar rates of adverse events compared with patients receiving comparator regimens. An exception is an increased risk of asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia, which is due to competitive inhibition of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. Although hyperbilirubinemia is a common adverse drug reaction of atazanavir therapy (22-47%), fewer than 2% of patients discontinue atazanavir therapy because of this adverse effect. Common adverse effects reported with atazanavir include infection, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, peripheral neuropathy, and rash. Of significance, fewer abnormalities have been observed in plasma lipid profiles in patients treated with atazanavir compared with other protease inhibitor-containing regimens. As with other protease inhibitors, atazanavir is also a substrate and moderate inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, in particular CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Clinically significant drug interactions include (but are not limited to) antacids, proton pump inhibitors, histamine type 2 receptor antagonists, tenofovir, diltiazem, irinotecan, simvastatin, lovastatin, St. John's wort, and warfarin. We conclude that atazanavir is a distinctively characteristic protease inhibitor owing to its in vitro potency, once-daily dosing, distinct initial resistance pattern, and infrequent association with metabolic abnormalities."

Among 432 patients failing antiretroviral therapy, five (1.15%) harboured viruses with Q151M mutation into the RT gene and no viruses were identified harbouring insertion at codon 69. Also we have studied the long-term benefit of HIV genotypic testing with the failure to reach a viral load below 50 copies/ml within 1 year of antiretroviral therapy using as the primary end-point. A group of 64 HIV-positive antiretroviral multiexperienced patients were examined, all of them failing the current ART. HIV-RNA changed -0.8 log at month 4 and +0.1 log and -0.5 log at months 8 and 12, respectively. The proportion of patients with viral load below 50 copies/ml was 19.3, 32.8, and 28.1% at months 4, 8, and 12, respectively. In multidrug-experienced patients, genotype-guided therapy is not in fact able to achieve complete viral suppression in more than 30% of patients after 1 year of ART. The development of more precise resistance tests and interpretations are needed for better control of HIV replication. Other metabolic/pharmacokinetics factors of poor drug adherence should also be assessed."
9401,0.001,1.0000,"Haematological abnormalities frequently occur in patients infected by human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1). Increasing evidence indicates that bone marrow suppression (BM) results from viral infection of accessory cells, with impaired stromal function and alteration of haematopoietic growth factor network. We have investigated the effects of antiretroviral therapy on cytokine and chemokine production by BM cells and stromal cells in a group of HIV-1-infected subjects before and during treatment. Compared with uninfected controls, an altered cytokine and chemokine production by BM cells was observed before treatment, characterized by decreased interleukin 2 (IL-2) and elevated tumour necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell-expressed and secreted) levels, along with a defective BM clonogenic activity. Antiretroviral therapy showed increased BM clonogenic capability, associated with normalization of IL-2 production and chemokine receptors expression on CD34+ cells. Pre-therapy, BM accessory cells were represented by macrophage-like cells, in some cases positive for HIV-1 DNA, suggesting that these cells are the main target of HIV-1 infection. During therapy, the stromal cells became predominantly fibroblastoid-like, as observed in normal controls, and were negative for HIV-1 DNA. Controlling HIV-1 replication may produce amelioration of stem cell activity, and restoration of stromal cell pattern and functions, with increased IL-2 production at BM level."

Program participants showed significant improvement over comparison group participants on measures of HIV/AIDS and treatment-related knowledge and recognition and understanding of HIV terms.

710,0.001,1.0000,"Advanced HIV disease, defined as a CD4 cell count below 200 cells/μl or the presence of an AIDS-defining illness, remains common among HIV-infected individuals who first present for medical care. In developed countries, nearly 30% of new HIV diagnoses occurred at advanced stages of the disease, and it is important because advanced HIV disease has been associated with worse clinical outcomes, including lower rates of virological response, higher morbidity, and higher mortality. However, there are scarce data regarding which is the best antiretroviral regimen in these patients. Nowadays, integrase inhibitor-based regimens are widely recommended as the best initial therapy for treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients by all international guidelines. However, these guidelines hardly mention the recommended regimens in individuals with advanced HIV disease. Otherwise, recent data indicating a higher risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome associated to the use of integrase inhibitors have raised concerns on the use of these drugs in patients with advanced HIV disease. The aim of this article is to review the available evidence from randomized clinical trials for the best treatment in patients with advanced HIV disease."
4491,0.001,1.0000,"The naphthyridinone GSK364735 potently inhibited recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase in a strand transfer assay (mean 50% inhibitory concentration +/- standard deviation, 8 +/- 2 nM). As expected based on the structure of the drug, it bound competitively with another two-metal binding inhibitor (Kd [binding constant], 6 +/- 4 nM). In a number of different cellular assays, GSK364735 inhibited HIV replication with potency at nanomolar concentrations (e.g., in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and MT-4 cells, 50% effective concentrations were 1.2 +/- 0.4 and 5 +/- 1 nM, respectively), with selectivity indexes of antiviral activity versus in-assay cytotoxicity of at least 2,200. When human serum was added, the antiviral potency decreased (e.g., a 35-fold decrease in the presence of 100% human serum was calculated by extrapolation from the results of the MT-4 cell assay). In cellular assays, GSK364735 blocked viral DNA integration, with a concomitant increase in two-long-terminal-repeat circles. As expected, this integrase inhibitor was equally active against wild-type viruses and mutant viruses resistant to approved drugs targeting either reverse transcriptase or protease. In contrast, some but not all viruses resistant to other integrase inhibitors were resistant to GSK364735. When virus was passaged in the presence of the inhibitor, we identified resistance mutations within the integrase active site that were the same as or similar to mutations arising in response to other two-metal binding inhibitors. Finally, either additive or synergistic effects were observed when GSK364735 was tested in combination with approved antiretrovirals (i.e., no antagonistic effects were seen). Thus, based on all the data, GSK364735 exerted potent antiviral activity through the inhibition of viral DNA integration by interacting at the two-metal binding site within the catalytic center of HIV integrase."
2307,0.001,1.0000,"Myeloid cells are important reservoirs of HIV-1 infection. In response to pathogenic agents, macrophages secrete inflammatory cytokines that can modulate viral replication and contribute to AIDS pathogenesis. Because HIV replication is dependent on cellular activation, immunosuppressive cytokines that deactivate macrophages and T cells may be important modulators of an antiviral effect. We tested the anti-HIV potential of the immunosuppressive cytokine-transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta 1) alone and in combination with AZT in a new monomyeloblastic model of HIV-1 infection. The PLB-985 cell model was infected with HIV IIIB strain, and the course of HIV-1 infection and replication was monitored by reverse transcriptase assay, p24 immunofluorescence, and northern blot analysis of HIV-1-specific mRNA. TGF-beta 1 as a single agent had no effect on the multiplication of HIV-IIIB in de novo-infected PLB 985 monomyeloblastic cells. However, cotreatment with TGF-beta 1 and AZT synergistically slowed virus multiplication within the first week following infection, as determined by reverse transcriptase measurement, p24 antigen detection, and northern blot analysis of viral RNA. The synergistic actions of TGF-beta 1 and AZT were also observed in PLB 985 cells infected with an AZT-resistant strain of HIV-1 (HIV 1393). Synergism between nucleoside analogs and cytokines may be an important therapeutic approach to HIV-1 infection. Elucidation of the role of cytokines in controlling the degree of HIV multiplication may have an impact on both clinical treatments and understanding the progression to AIDS."
470,0.001,1.0000,"A T cell clone (ACH-2) derived from T cells infected with HIV-1 was found to produce HIV-1 in response to stimulation with a monokine-enriched supernatant prepared by culturing human monocyte/macrophages with bacterial LPS (LPS-MO SN). Monokine induction of ACH-2 cells resulted in augmented virus production reflected by an increase in reverse transcriptase activity and in the synthesis of all major viral proteins. Examination of the cells by indirect immunofluorescence revealed that 10 to 15% of uninduced cells constitutively expressed HIV proteins, whereas 100% showed positive immunofluorescence in response to LPS-MO SN. This induction of virus by LPS-MO SN resulted in approximately a 100-fold increase of infectious virus production over uninduced ACH-2 cells. LPS alone could not induce HIV-1 expression, whereas LPS-MO SN resulted in the greatest virus expression. Cell separation studies confirmed the source of the inducing factor(s) to be cells bearing the mature monocyte/macrophage marker, Leu M3. Biochemical fractionation of the LPS-MO SN suggested that one or more factors, having apparent Mr of approximately 45 kDa, were involved in this induction. Absorption of the LPS-MO SN with immunoaffinity gels specific for human TNF-alpha was shown to completely remove the HIV inducing activity for the ACH-2 cell line."
7237,0.001,1.0000,"The activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) expression in latently infected cells by exogenous agents is believed to be important in the progression of AIDS. Most factors that are known to activate HIV-1 gene expression increase the binding of NF-kappa B or NF-kappa B-like transcription factors to the HIV-1 core enhancer region. In this report, we demonstrate that retinoic acid (RA) treatment of promonocytic U937 cells stimulates expression from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) long terminal repeat (LTR). Furthermore, RA and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) synergistically stimulated both SIVmac and HIV-1 LTRs to levels of expression comparable to that achieved by the viral transactivator Tat. The cis-acting elements required for a response to RA and PMA cotreatment are located between nucleotides -50 and +1 of SIVmac and between nucleotides -83 and +80 of HIV-1. Thus, the synergistic stimulation induced by RA and PMA is NF-kappa B independent. Analysis of deletion mutants of the SIVmac LTR demonstrates that RA and PMA stimulation cooperates with NF-kappa B and Sp1. An SIVmac LTR-reporter gene construct [pLTR(-50/+466)CAT] lacking NF-kappa B and Sp1 binding sites was not activated by Tat in untreated cells but was activated in cells that were cotreated with RA and PMA. Furthermore, gel retardation assays demonstrated that RA treatment causes a change in the pattern of a cellular factor(s) which binds to the -50 through +1 region of the SIVmac LTR. These data suggest that RA induces a PMA-activatable cellular factor that cooperates with NF-kappa B, Sp1, or Tat to stimulate LTR-directed transcription."

We classified all HIV/AIDS patients into HIV monoinfected and TB coinfected, at a ratio of 2:1.Compared with the HIV monoinfected, patients with HIV/TB coinfection were more likely to be older, male, less educated, unemployed, carrying health insurance, having advanced stage of HIV infection, longer history with HIV, and other opportunistic infections. Patients coinfected with TB were also more likely to hold a negative belief that their HIV treatment could prevent exacerbations, and reported significantly worse emotional/informational support, social interaction, and perceived health status. Better social support and better self-efficacy to the HIV treatment adherence was significantly associated with better perceived health status among patients with HIV and TB coinfection.Having HIV/TB coinfection was associated with poorer perceived general well-being and mental health, particularly in those undergoing TB therapy. Our findings suggest the need for mental health referrals and medication management for coinfected individuals, as well as further efforts and policies to improve coordinated care."

The questionnaire included questions on the participant's status in regard to antibody to human T-lymphotropic retrovirus, type III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus (HTLV-III/LAV), and the meaning of this test result. HTC health-care providers were asked to complete a separate questionnaire containing 17 questions about information given patients concerning their HTLV-III/LAV antibody status and its meaning. Overall, patients had a good base of knowledge about AIDS; however, there were gaps in this knowledge. Twenty-nine percent of patients did not know that spouses of AIDS patients were at risk for AIDS; 47% did not know that sexual partners of persons with hemophilia were at risk; and 32% did not know that hemophilic children were at risk. Further, only 69% understood that antibody-positive individuals had had contact with the AIDS virus. Identifying these and other areas of misunderstanding will provide the information needed to design educational strategies and psychosocial support programs appropriate for the hemophilic population, and which may serve as a model for other populations."

Most cases had acquired infection abroad through blood, blood products or sexual contact. The number of cases is continuously increasing. Fear and ignorance about HIV infection causes panic among health care workers (HCWs) whenever a case is discovered and needs medical care. We assessed the knowledge and attitude of 346 HCWs towards the probability of occupational HIV infection using a self administered questionnaire. The sample included physicians, surgeons, nurses, laboratory technicians and ambulance workers. 72.8% of HCWs believed that they are in ""great"" danger of acquiring AIDS through occupational exposure, whereas 0.6% thought that there was no danger. 67% of HCWs had wrong ideas about transmission of HIV (toilet seats, droplet infection, touching patients). 83.5% mentioned that AIDS patients should be isolated in quarantine. The main source of information about AIDS was the television, radio and ordinary press. 44.8% got their information from textbooks or scientific literature. 95.4% felt the need for more information about infection and disease. The results show an urgent need to start a program of education of HCWs concerning the risk of occupational HIV infection and the measures of its prevention."

METHOD A cross-sectional study was performed on 388 cats entering the Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals animal shelter in Auckland, New Zealand between 7 February 2014 and 30 May 2014. Whole blood samples were collected from each cat and tested for FIV antibody and FeLV antigen using a commercial point-of-care ELISA. Information on the signalment and health status of the cat at the time of entry was also recorded. Blood and saliva samples from a subset of cats were tested for FIV and FeLV proviral DNA using a real-time PCR assay. RESULTS Of the 388 cats in the study sample, 146 (37.6%) had been relinquished by owners, 237 (62.4%) were strays, and 5 (1.3%) were of unknown origin. Overall, 53/388 (13.7%) cats tested positive for FIV antibodies and 4/388 (1.0%) were positive for FeLV antigen. Stray cats had a higher FIV seroprevalence than relinquished cats (42/237 (17.8%) vs. 11/146 (7.5%); p=0.008). Of 53 cats that were FIV-seropositive, 51 (96%) tested positive for FIV proviral DNA using PCR testing of blood. Of these 51 cats, 28 (55%) were positive by PCR testing of saliva. Of the four cats that were FeLV antigen-positive by ELISA, two (50%) were positive for FeLV proviral DNA by PCR testing of blood. The odds of a cat being seropositive for FIV were greater for intact compared to desexed cats (OR=3.3; 95% CI=1.6-7.4) and for male compared to female cats (OR=6.5; 95% CI=3.2-14.0). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The seroprevalence for FIV was 14% among cats entering an animal shelter in Auckland, whereas the prevalence of FeLV antigen-positive cats was only 1%. These findings suggest differences in the transmission dynamics of each virus in free-roaming cat populations in New Zealand. Our study also highlights the potential role of desexing cats in reducing transmission of FIV. However, further data from first-opinion veterinary practices are required to confirm that these findings may be generalised to the wider domestic cat population in New Zealand."

Although to a lesser extent, C-to-T1653 and T-to-V(C/A/G)1753 were also noteworthy in our previous study. To assess the clinical significance of these mutations, we determined the nucleotide sequence of an HBV DNA fragment covering these sites in HBsAg-positive blood donors (n = 160) and patients with chronic hepatitis (n = 66), liver cirrhosis (n = 45), and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 58), most of whom were infected with genotype C HBV (subtype adr). In cases where HBe antigen was positive, the frequency of T1653 and/or V1753 showed a striking increment from chronic hepatitis patients (18%) to liver cirrhosis and/or hepatoma patients (82%), whereas that of T1762/A1764 was already high in chronic hepatitis patients (76%). In HBe antigen-negative cases, by contrast, significant difference in the frequency of T1653/V1753 mutants was found between blood donors (22%) and chronic hepatitis patients (67%). Our results suggest that T1653/V(particularly C)1753 mutants are more closely associated than T1762/A1764 with the progression of liver disease from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis in HBe antigen-positive patients. A system of site-directed mutagenesis PCR RFLP was constructed to diagnose T1653 and C/A1753 more conveniently. Detecting T1653 and C/A1753 by this method would contribute to the differential diagnosis of HBV-associated liver disease."

The current study characterized CD161(+) MAIT and CD161-TCRVα7.2(+) T cell subsets within a large cohort of HIV patients with emphasis on patients with slow disease progression and elite controllers. Mononuclear cells from blood and lymph node samples as well as plasma from 63 patients and 26 healthy donors were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry and ELISA for IL-18, sCD14 and sCD163. Additionally, MAIT cells were analyzed after in vitro stimulation with different cytokines and/or fixed E.coli. Reduced numbers of CD161(+) MAIT cells during HIV infection were detectable in the blood and lymph nodes of all patient groups, including elite controllers. CD161+ MAIT cell numbers did not recover even after successful antiretroviral treatment. The loss of CD161(+) MAIT cells was correlated with higher levels of MAIT cell activation; an increased frequency of the CD161-TCRVα7.2(+)T cell subset in HIV infection was observed. In vitro stimulation of MAIT cells with IL-18 and IL-12, IL-7 and fixed E.coli also resulted in a rapid and additive reduction of the MAIT cell frequency defined by CD161, IL-18R and CCR6. In summary, the irreversible reduction of the CD161(+) MAIT cell subset seems to be an early event in HIV infection that is independent of later stages of the disease. This loss appears to be at least partially due to the distinctive vulnerability of MAIT cells to the pronounced stimulation by microbial products and cytokines during HIV-infection."
8885,0.001,1.0000,"One of the main characteristics of the human immunodeficiency virus is its genetic variability and rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions. This variability, resulting from the lack of proofreading activity of the viral reverse transcriptase, generates mutations that could be fixed either by random genetic drift or by positive selection. Among the forces driving positive selection are antiretroviral therapy and CD8+ T-cells, the most important immune mechanism involved in viral control. Here, we describe mutations induced by these selective forces acting on the pol gene of HIV in a group of infected individuals. We used Maximum Likelihood analyses of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations per site (dN/dS) to study the extent of positive selection in the protease and the reverse transcriptase, using 614 viral sequences from Colombian patients. We also performed computational approaches, docking and algorithmic analyses, to assess whether the positively selected mutations affected binding to the HLA molecules. We found 19 positively-selected codons in drug resistance-associated sites and 22 located within CD8+ T-cell epitopes. A high percentage of mutations in these epitopes has not been previously reported. According to the docking analyses only one of those mutations affected HLA binding. However, algorithmic methods predicted a decrease in the affinity for the HLA molecule in seven mutated peptides. The bioinformatics strategies described here are useful to identify putative positively selected mutations associated with immune escape but should be complemented with an experimental approach to define the impact of these mutations on the functional profile of the CD8+ T-cells.

Three patients in this study had NAbs to preexisting autologous HIV-1 and an episode of virus rebound after a prolonged period of virus suppression. To investigate the influence of NAbs on virus evolution, envelope genotypes of preexisting and rebound viruses were examined. Phylogenetic analysis of env (V1-V5) sequences indicated that rebound viruses had evolved from or preexisted in baseline populations. By use of envelope pseudotype viruses, rebound viruses were found to be significantly resistant to neutralization by autologous antibody in all 3 patients, indicating that rebound viruses were selected by NAbs.

Proteolysis occurred at the homologous -GPGR(arrow downward)A-, an important neutralizing determinant of HIV-1. It required soluble CD4 and was prevented by inhibitors of uPA but not by inhibitors of likely contaminating plasma proteinases. It was accelerated by heparin, a known cofactor for plasminogen activation. In immune capture experiments, tight binding of uPA to viral particles, which did not depend on CD4, was also demonstrated. Active site-directed inhibitors or uPA diminished this binding, as did a neutralizing antibody to V3. Addition of exogenous uPA to the laboratory-adapted IIIB strain of HIV-1, the macrophage-tropic field strains JR-CSF and SF-162, or a fresh patient isolate of indeterminate tropism, followed by infection of macrophages with the various treated viruses, resulted in severalfold increases in subsequent viral replication, as judged by yields of reverse transcriptase activity and p24 antigen, as well as incorporation, as judged by PCR in situ. These responses were reversible by inhibitors or antibodies targeting the proteinase active site or the V3 loop. We propose that uPA, a transcriptionally regulated proteinase which is upregulated when macrophages are HIV infected, can be bound and utilized by the virus to aid in fusion and may be an endogenous component that is critical to the infection of macrophages by HIV-1."
3164,0.001,1.0000,"System dynamics (SD) modeling belongs to the rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary field of system science research. This field adds value to more traditional health research by contributing to the design and testing of complex integrated models of change, to examine health system performance and patient outcomes. Using selected milestones in HIV care management to frame our simulation research, we created a SD model to examine three patient subgroups of women of color (WOC) represented in our multi-site cohort, classified by their health care seeking status at baseline. Asked to reflect on their circumstance 6 months prior to enrollment in the MSE cohort, 53% noted they were receiving some care (In Care, n = 341), 31% that they had been seeking care (Seeking Care, n = 201), and 16% that they were undecided about seeking care (i.e., answered that they may or may not look for care) for treatment of their HIV (May or May Not Seek Care, n = 103). Our SD model compared simulated patterns of patient retention over 24 months in relation to: (1) access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), (2) adherence to ART, and (3) viral suppression. Assessed patterns yielded insights about system capacities and constraints in the context of the SPNS initiative under evaluation."

A prospective study on active targeted HTC and linkage to care among MSM (≥18 years old) was conducted at a gay sauna in Thailand from November 2013 to October 2015. HIV risks and risk perception were evaluated through an anonymous survey. HIV testing with result notification and care appointment arrangement were provided on-site. Of the 358 participants; median age was 30 years; 206/358(58%) were at high risk for HIV acquisition; 148/358(41%) accepted HTC, all of whom either had prior negative HIV tests [98/148 (66%)] or had not known their HIV status [50/148 (34%)]. The three most common reasons for declining HTC were prior HIV testing within 6 months (48%), not ready (19%) and perceiving self as no risk (11%). Of the 262 moderate- and high-risk participants, 172 (66%) had false perception of low HIV risk which was significantly associated with declining HTC. Among the 148 participants undergoing HTC, 25 (17%) were HIV-infected. Having false perception of low risk (P = 0.004) and age <30 years (P = 0.02) were independently associated with HIV positivity. Only 14 of the 25 HIV-infected participants (56%) could be contacted after the result notification, of whom 12 (86%) had established HIV care and received immediate antiretroviral therapy. The active targeted HTC and facilitating care establishment was feasible among MSM attending the gay sauna but required strategies to improve accuracy of HIV-risk perception and linkage to care."

We examined an HIV-seronegative 63-year-old Japanese man with hepatitis C virus-associated liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma manifesting peritoneal lymphomatous effusion without tumor mass at any body site. The lymphoma cells were examined twice by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, three-color flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular analyses. The nuclear morphology of lymphoma cells was similar to that of large noncleaved cells, although the lymphoma cell size was a little smaller that of the usual large-cell lymphoma. Immunophenotyping of lymphoma cells in the ascitic fluid revealed a mature peripheral B-cell phenotype (CD5- CD10- CD19+ CD20+ CD22+ Ig G+ lambda+). Cytogenetics showed a clonal population: 45,X,-Y, der(2) t(2;6)(q31;p21.3), t(4;8)(q21;q11.2), der(6) t(2;6)(q31;p21.3) add(6)(q15), t(9;14)(p13;q32.3) [10]/47, idem, +der(6) t(2;6), +16[10]. Southern blot analysis revealed rearranged fragments with a probe for immunoglobulin heavy chain, some of which were a size similar to those with a PAX-5 gene probe. Polymorphism, not rearrangement, of the c-MYC gene, was also found. HHV8 and the Epstein-Barr virus were not detected by polymerase chain reaction. This case is the first report of an HHV8- PEL with t(9;14) involving a PAX-5 gene rearrangement in an HIV-seronegative patient. This primary effusion lymphoma manifested spontaneous regression without any therapy. These findings suggest that there may be an additional subcategory of primary effusion lymphoma that is not associated with HHV8 nor c-MYC(R) but is pathogenetically associated with the PAX-5 gene or hepatitis C virus."
5754,0.001,1.0000,"A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examined the safety, tolerance, immunological effect and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity of sub-cutaneously administered HE2000 (16alpha-bromoepiandrosterone) as monotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with HIV-1. Twenty-four patients received five sequential daily doses of 50 or 100 mg of HE2000 or placebo every 6 weeks for up to three courses, and were followed thereafter for 3 months. HE2000 was safe, with transient injection site reactions being the main side-effect. Peripheral blood samples, collected serially, were analysed for changes in immune cell phenotypes. Significant increases were observed in the numbers of circulating dendritic cells, early activated (CD69+ CD25-) CD8 T-cells and T-NK cells after administration of 50-mg doses of HE2000 (p < 0.05). Gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was analysed by real-time RT-PCR. Before treatment, HIV-1-infected patients had significantly elevated transcripts for a number of inflammatory mediators (p < 0.012). After 50 mg or 100 mg HE2000, but not after placebo, there were significant sustained decreases in IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and Cox-2 transcripts (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in CD4 cell numbers, although patients receiving 50-mg doses demonstrated a significant decrease in viral load (- 0.6 log; p < 0.01). Anti-HIV-1 T-cell responses were analysed serially using GAG-peptides to stimulate cytoplasmic IFN-gamma responses. After three courses, the 50-mg dose group demonstrated a significant increase in CD8 T-cell response against two distinct GAG peptide pools (p < 0.03). These findings suggest that immune-based therapies may be able to impact viral load by decreasing inflammation and/or stimulating CD8 T-cells."
7449,0.001,1.0000,"The close association between AIDS and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is well known. Few studies are available that evaluate the profile of NHL in a cohort of HIV-infected patients who reside in Puerto Rico. The present study was performed in a cohort of 2,843 HIV-infected patients followed in the Retrovirus Research Center at Bayamón, Puerto Rico, evaluated between January 1992 until December 2000. NHL prevalence was determined and differences between AIDS defining and non-AIDS defining NHL were evaluated with the Fisher and ANOVA test. NHL prevalence was 0.9%. Nine (33%) were AIDS-defining (AIDS-d) NHL and 18 (67%) were non-AIDS-d NHL. Both groups were similar in gender distribution and mean diagnosis age. The median CD4+ T cell count at diagnosis was below 150/mm3 in both groups. Injecting drug use was higher in AIDS-d NHL patients and Homo-Bisexual contact was higher in non-AIDS-d NHL patients. Death rate in the first year after the NHL was 67% in the AIDS-d group and 56% in the non-AIDS-d group. AIDS-d NHL incidence decreased after the implementation of combined antiretroviral therapy in the cohort, a finding not seen in the non-AIDS-d NHL. In summary the study detected low NHL prevalence, with high degree of immunological damage at the time of the lymphoma diagnosis. Conversely dissimilar response to the antiretroviral therapies was also perceived in the incidence of the two NHL groups."
5353,0.001,1.0000,"T cells are central players in the immune response to infectious disease, with the specificity of their responses controlled by the T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex on the cell surface. Impairment of TCR/CD3-directed CD4(+) T-cell immune responses is frequently observed in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2). Virus replication is also regulated by T-cell activation factors, with HIV-1 and HIV-2 responding to different TCR/CD3-directed cellular pathways. We previously demonstrated that HIV-1 infection of the human interleukin-2-dependent CD4(+) T-cell line WE17/10 abrogates TCR/CD3 function and surface expression by a specific loss of CD3-gamma gene transcripts. In this study, we show that HIV-2 provokes the same molecular defect in CD3-gamma gene transcripts, resulting in a similar but delayed progressive loss of TCR/CD3 surface expression after infection."

Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections of the parotid lesion showed a diffuse infiltrate of large mononuclear cells with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli, consistent with a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrated expression of the T-cell markers CD3 and UCHL-1, as well as latent membrane protein 1 and T-cell intracellular antigen 1. Flow cytometry showed surface expression of CD2, CD3, CD7 (dim), CD8, and CD56. CD5 was not expressed. Molecular evaluation by polymerase chain reaction demonstrated monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gamma gene. Epstein-Barr virus early RNA and human immunodeficiency virus RNA were demonstrated by in situ hybridization. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of T-cell lymphoma of the parotid in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus.

37,0.001,1.0000,"To search for events underlying reduction of peripheral viremia and integration of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA into the liver cell genome in long-term virus carriers with hepatocellular carcinoma, paired samples of liver and tumor tissue were analyzed by molecular hybridization and immunological methods. Most tumor tissues contained integrated viral DNA; in none was extrachromosomal HBV DNA detected. Integrated HBV DNS was also found in peritumor liver tissue in the majority of patients. However, liver of patients either with or without peripheral viremia also contained free HBV DNA and replicative intermediates. In three nonviremic patients with replicative HBV DNA in liver, viral core antigen expression was markedly reduced or absent, whereas viral envelope protein (surface antigen) expression was normal. In one case, replicative intermediates in liver were sensitive to DNase I digestion, indicating that viral DNA was not encapsidated in normal viral core particles. These results suggest that decreased or defective core antigen production can lead to reduced viremia associated with blocked virus assembly/secretion and accumulation of unencapsidated HBV DNA replicative intermediates in the liver cell. Accumulation of such HBV DNA molecular forms in the liver may lead to an increased propensity for HBV DNA to integrate into the host genome, which has been found with high frequency in hepatic neoplasms from patients infected with hepatitis B virus."
6068,0.001,1.0000,"The Nef protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been shown to enhance the infectivity of virus particles, downmodulate cell surface proteins, and associate with many intracellular proteins that are thought to facilitate HIV infection. One of the challenges in defining the molecular events regulated by Nef has been obtaining good expression of Nef protein in T cells. This has been attributed to effects of Nef on cell proliferation and apoptosis. We have designed a Nef protein that is readily expressed in T-cell lines and whose function is inducibly activated. It is composed of a fusion between full-length Nef and the estrogen receptor hormone-binding domain (Nef-ER). The Nef-ER is kept in an inactive state due to steric hindrance, and addition of the membrane-permeable drug 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT), which binds to the ER domain, leads to inducible activation of Nef-ER within cells. We demonstrate that Nef-ER inducibly associates with the 62-kDa Ser/Thr kinase and is localized to specific membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) only after activation. Using this inducible Nef, we also compared the specific requirements for CD4 and HLA-A2 downmodulation in a SupT1 T-cell line. Half-maximal downmodulation of cell surface CD4 required very little active Nef-ER and occurred as early as 4 h after addition of 4-HT. In contrast, 50% downmodulation of HLA-A2 by Nef required 16 to 24 h and about 50- to 100-fold-greater concentrations of 4-HT. These data suggest that HLA-A2 downmodulation may require certain threshold levels of active Nef. The differential timing of CD4 and HLA-A2 downmodulation may have implications for HIV pathogenesis and immune evasion."
3557,0.001,1.0000,"Cell lines originally derived from malignant tumours of the brain were infected by diverse human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) isolates. By surface immunofluorescence it was shown that susceptible cells did not bear the CD4 antigen. They were also non-permissive for the formation of plaques by vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes and did not form syncytia with HIV-producing cells. Virus production was of low titre, and reverse transcriptase and the p24 antigen were consistently undetectable in the culture supernatants. Output virus could be detected by cocultivation with a sensitive T cell line, C8166, by the culture of supernatant medium with T cells and by detection of proviral HIV DNA after amplification. A higher multiplicity of input virus was required to establish a brain cell infection than was required for T lymphocytes or monocytes. Some HIV-susceptible brain cells contained mRNA for CD4 but infection was not blocked by anti-CD4 antibodies. Apparently HIV infection of these cells does not involve CD4 as the cellular receptor."

Both cases were positive for human immunodeficiency virus-1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot methods. Histologic sections from each patient showed a high-grade pleomorphic T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and immunophenotyping demonstrated a prevalence of reactivity for CD4 (helper) over CD8 (suppressor) antigens. T-cell receptor beta-chain gene rearrangement studies revealed a rearranged pattern with either the HindIII or BamHI enzymes, whereas immunoglobulin heavy chain genes retained a germ-line configuration. Viral sequences specific for human T-cell leukemia virus-I, human T-cell leukemia virus-II, or HIV-1 were not detected. Thus, although rare, T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma may be observed in HIV-1-infected individuals."
4895,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was studied by means of CD4-expressing human-murine T-cell hybrids, containing a variable amount of human chromosomes. Fusion of the HPRT- murine cell line BW5147 with human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or normal human blood cells resulted in a panel of human-murine T-cell hybrids. For this study, we used four hybrids containing all or several human chromosomes, which all expressed the CD4 antigen, as assessed by different anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (e.g., OKT4A, Leu-3a, and MT151) and, in addition, a variable number of other human T-cell antigens. For infection, HTLV-IIIB-infected H9 cells, pretreated with mitomycin C, and cell-free concentrated supernatants from these cells were used. In cells of inoculated cultures of the CD4+ T-cell hybrids, no viral antigen could be demonstrated. Culture supernatants of inoculated hybrids, except for an initial rise due to the virus inoculum, never showed reverse transcriptase activity above background. Cocultivation of these cell cultures with H9 cells did not result in detectable virus replication. Cocultivation of CD4-expressing hybrid cells with HIV-infected cells did not result in syncytium formation. Moreover, these hybrids were resistent to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-HIV pseudotypes. These findings imply that expression of the CD4 antigen on the cell surface is not sufficient for productive infection with HIV. The infectivity block observed in these hybrids seems to occur at the level of virus penetration, presumably at the stage of membrane fusion events."

A total of 62 adult antiretroviral naïve HIV infected patients were enrolled in the study. Among them 26 had neurological complications of HIV infection (1st group), 16 patients had symptomatic disease without neurological involvements (2nd group) and 20 were asymptomatic patients (control group). Measurement of CD4 count was performed by indirect immunofluorescent assay by using the monoclonal antibodies and viral load (VL) in plasma--by RT PCR method. CD4 count was significantly lower in the 1st and 2nd group compared to the control group. There was correlation between the level of CD4 count and type of neurological manifestation. VL was comparable between the 1st and 2nd groups and was higher than in control group. There is a significant correlation between the level of CD4 count and type of neurological manifestation of HIV infection. Presence of neurological complication as well as other clinical manifestations is associated with decreased CD4 count and increased VL. Level of CD4 count can serve as an indicator for initiation of prophylaxis treatment of certain opportunistic pathogens."

Despite free testing and treatment, HIV pregnant women often have delayed or insufficient access to care. The aim of this study was to identify predictive factors of antiretroviral treatment<4 weeks in HIV pregnant women in Cayenne (French Guiana) and then to describe their attitudes, practices, and beliefs regarding HIV/AIDS. A case control study was conducted including all deliveries in Cayenne from 2003 to 2010. For each case, a standardized questionnaire including epidemiological, clinical, and biological data was administered. The analysis first described the summary statistics and then bivariate analysis studied the relation of each variable with the outcome. Multivariate analysis adjusted for the confounding factors. Thirty-three women in the first group and 96 in the control group were included in the study. Women born in French Guiana (OR = 5, IC95% = 1.22-20.86, p=0.027) had a high risk of treatment<4 weeks. The other factors associated with treatment<4 weeks in our study were benefiting from food parcels (OR = 12.72, IC95% = 2.07-78.14, p=0.006), consulting a traditional healer when sick (OR = 9.86, IC95% = 2.57-37.88, p= < 0.001), and drug use (OR = 6.27, IC95% = 1.26-31.13, p=0.025).

Through further modification of the lead compounds and structure-activity relationship analysis several new TIBO derivatives that show high potency, selectivity, and specificity against HIV-1 have been obtained. A new TIBO derivative, R86183, inhibits the replication of HIV-1, but not HIV-2, in a variety of CD4+ T-cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes, at a concentration of 0.3 to 30 nM, which is at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than the 50% cytotoxic concentration. Whereas an HIV-1 strain containing the Leu-100-->Ile mutation in the RT gene is about 400-fold less susceptible, R86183 still inhibits the replication of an HIV-1 strain containing the Tyr-181-->Cys RT mutation by 50% at a concentration of 130 nM. R86183 inhibits the poly(C).oligo(dG)12-18-directed HIV-1 RT reaction by 50% at a concentration of 57 nM. The antiviral activity of 22 TIBO derivatives in cell culture correlated well with their activity against HIV-1 RT. No such correlation was found for their cytotoxicity. The combination of R86183 with either zidovudine or didanosine resulted in a synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 (strain IIIB) replication. Combination of R86183 with the protease inhibitor Ro31-8959 was found to be additive. Also described is a dilution protocol circumventing overestimation and underestimation of antiviral activity due to adherence to plastic surfaces."

In addition we assessed the prevalence of non-B subtypes based on phylogenetic analysis of the pol gene. Plasma samples from 104 newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive patients were obtained in the year 2000. The entire protease gene and 320 amino acids of the reverse transcriptase gene were genotyped. Sequences were obtained from 97 patients. No subjects displayed primary resistance mutations in the protease gene, whereas all carried 1 or more secondary mutations. Resistance mutations in the RT-gene associated with NRTI-resistance were found in 1 patient, who was infected with zidovudine resistant HIV-1 harbouring the M41L mutation in combination with T215S and L210S. The T215S mutation has been showed to be associated with reversion of zidovudine resistance. The T215S mutation was found in 1 additional patient. The subtype distribution was subtype B 59%, C 18%, A 8%, CRF02_AG 5%, CRF01_AE 4%, D 3% and G 2%. We found 2 patients (2%) with mutations associated with resistance in the RT-gene and none in the protease gene indicating a low prevalence of resistant HIV-1 in Denmark in the year 2000."

7703,0.001,1.0000,"Recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation are pancytopenic for several weeks and immunosuppressed for many months as a result of myeloablative therapy required to eliminate the basic disease and to prevent allograft rejection. After bone marrow transplantation, these patients remain profoundly immunosuppressed by the chemotherapy and immunotherapy used as prophylaxis against graft-vs.-host disease, treatment of established disease or both. These patients are usually dependent on multiple blood products and are therefore at risk for hepatitis B virus infection, which may run a fulminant course. Active immunization against hepatitis B virus in the immediate pre-bone marrow transplantation and post-bone marrow transplantation periods was found to be ineffective, probably because of the absence of T cell-dependent B-cell responses, which persists for approximately 1 yr after bone marrow transplantation. We studied adoptive transfer of immunity to hepatitis B virus through bone marrow transplantation in two populations of patients. The first group (A) consisted of 12 pairs of BMT donors and recipients, in which all bone marrow donors were positive for antibodies to HBc and HBs as a result of previously acquired hepatitis B virus infection and resolution; all recipients were negative to antibodies to HBc and HBs. The second group (B) consisted of eight pairs of donors and recipients in which all the donors were actively immunized against hepatitis B virus before bone marrow transplantation; all recipients were negative for all hepatitis B virus markers. All bone marrow transplantation recipients were monitored for antibodies to hepatitis B virus antigens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Therefore, it is important that they adopt infection control policies aimed at preventing occupational transmission of these and other pathogens during their clinical practice. This study was designed, using a questionnaire format, to evaluate anesthesiologist compliance with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines for the prevention of occupational transmission of HIV and HBV. A total of 1149 questionnaires were mailed to anesthesiologists randomly selected from the members' directory of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). Of these, 493 (44%) were completed and returned. Eighty-eight percent of respondents reported that they always complied with CDC guidelines when presented with an HIV-infected patient, but only 24.7% adhered to the guidelines when the patient was considered low risk (P < 0.01). This trend was also reflected in the use of gloves and other protective wear in the perioperative period. Although 70% of respondents indicated that they recapped needles on a regular basis, this practice was not associated with an increased incidence of needlestick injuries. However, anesthesiologists who reported recapping needles using the one-handed technique were less likely to sustain a needlestick injury than those who recapped using the two-handed technique. Thirty-one percent and 72% of respondents respectively reported a clean or contaminated needlestick within the preceeding 12 mo.

3303,0.001,1.0000,"The relevance of zinc in resistance to infections by virus, fungi and bacteria is recognized because of its pivotal role in the efficiency of the entire immune system, in particular in conferring biological activity to a thymic hormone called thymulin, which has differentiation properties on T-cell lines. In infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the zinc-bound form of thymulin (active thymulin, ZnFTS) is strongly reduced in stage IV of the disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification) with concomitant decrements in CD4(+) cell count and zincemia values. The zinc-unbound form of thymulin (inactive thymulin, FTS) is, in contrast, very high. The in vitro addition of zinc to plasma samples induces a recovery of the thymulin active form, suggesting low zinc bioavailability as the cause of impaired thymic functions with consequent CD4(+) depletion. An analysis of risk factors for the incidence of recidivism opportunistic infections shows CD4(+) depletion and zinc deficiency to have significant scores. Supplementation with zinc for 1 mo (45 mg Zn(2+)/d) associated with zidovudine (AZT) therapy in stage IV induces recovery of active zinc-bound thymulin, of zincemia, of CD4(+) cells with concomitant reduction (50%) of recidivism opportunistic infections compared with the AZT-treated group. Complete disappearance of recidivism by Candida aesophagea or Pneumocystis carinii is observed after supplementation with zinc. The relative risk factors (CD4(+) depletion and zinc-deficiency) have lower scores in the HIV-positive zinc-treated group, confirming, as such, the relevance of zinc in opportunistic infections that involve extracellular matrix. Such an assumption is indirectly confirmed with new HAART, where no opportunistic infections occur. Indeed, HIV RNA is inversely correlated with both CD4(+) and zincemia values (r = -0.73, P<0.01) in HAART-treated subjects. Lower scores for the same relative factors for the appearance of opportunistic infections are present in HAART-treated subjects compared with those treated with AZT. These findings, on the one hand, show the poor efficacy of AZT therapy compared with HAART therapy for the progression of HIV, but on the other hand, they suggest that the lack of occurrence of opportunistic infections by HAART may also result from major zinc bioavailability. This further supports the key role played by zinc against opportunistic infections in HIV with a possible independent effect by either HIV or the pathogens involved."
9283,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic liver disease (CLD) is frequent in Somalia. In a case-control study, 116 in-patients with CLD were compared with the same number of age and sex matched controls. Demographic variables, use of drugs, symptoms and signs, serological markers for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and serum alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) were assessed. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was found in 44 cases of which 17 had antibodies to hepatitis D virus (anti-HD) and 7 had hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Twenty-three controls were HBsAg-positive, of whom 3 had anti-HD and one HBeAg. Increased relative risks (95% confidence intervals in parentheses) were 2.5 (1.3-4.5) for HBsAg, 6.5 (1.7-21.5) for anti-HD, and 7.4 (0.9-66.5) for HBeAg. Despite the association between the presence of HBV markers and CLD, 62% of the cases had no markers indicating current HBV infection. This was reflected in the low risk attributable to chronic HBV infection (22.6%), which was lower than that in patients with CLD in other African populations with a high HBsAg carrier rate. The prevalence of HBV markers did not differ between cases with AFP greater than 100 ng/ml and those with AFP less than 100 ng/ml. The former were characterized by male predominance, shorter duration of symptoms, and larger mean liver size, indicative of malignancy. The mean age of HBsAg-positive cases with AFP greater than 100 ng/ml was significantly lower (by 7.7 years) than that of HBsAg-negative cases with AFP greater than 100 ng/ml. Among the CLD patients with AFP less than 100 ng/ml, 48 were HBsAg-negative. These cases differed significantly from the other 68 cases in that more were females (35% against 16%), more originated from an agricultural area (56% against 30%), and more were regular consumers of drugs (48% against 28%). In conclusion, factors as yet undefined play a considerable role in the causation of CLD in Somalia. The possibility of determining the role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) awaits the development of more specific assays for anti-HCV antibodies."
4821,0.001,1.0000,"Evaluation of resistance pattern in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Retrospective study of hepatitis B virus (HBV) resistance mutations in patients found viraemic after first-line treatment. HBV viral load was determined by a real-time polymerase chain reaction and the substitutions in HBV-DNA were studied by polymerase sequencing test. First line treatment had failed in 12 out of 33 patients (36%) receiving anti-HBV drugs. The 12 patients with persistent viraemia were all lamivudine (LAM) experienced and 7 had a polymerase sequencing test available. LAM substitution mutations L180M + M204V/I were found in six out of seven cases, with an accompanying V173L mutation in three cases. These mutations were also related with changes in HBsAg. The use of potent drugs in the first line anti-HBV therapy may reduce the resistance mutations in the future."
3083,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is responsible for viral persistence. This study aimed to investigate the serum surrogate markers for cccDNA and to evaluate the intrahepatic viral events associated with disease activity in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients. Thirty-three treatment-naïve patients with a negative HBeAg who had a liver biopsy were studied. Active disease was defined as a serum alanine aminotransferase >40 IU/L and a serum HBV DNA >10,000 copies/ml. This study showed significant correlation between serum HBV DNA and both log cccDNA (r = 0.41, P = 0.018) and log total intrahepatic HBV DNA (r = 0.71, P < 0.0001). No significant correlation was observed between serum HBsAg and log cccDNA (P = 0.15) or log total intrahepatic HBV DNA (P = 0.97). Fourteen and 19 patients had inactive and active disease, respectively. The median log cccDNA and log total intrahepatic HBV DNA (copies/10(6) cells) were significantly higher in patients with active disease compared with those with inactive disease (4.11 vs. 3.53, P = 0.03 and 5.46 vs. 4.64, P < 0.001, respectively). The HBV replicative efficiency, defined as the ratio of serum HBV DNA to cccDNA, was approximately 20% higher in patients with active disease. No significant difference was observed in the HBsAg levels and the ratio of serum HBsAg to cccDNA between the two groups. In conclusion, serum HBV DNA, but not HBsAg, reflects the amount of cccDNA and the replication efficiency of HBV in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B."
2113,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1 sequences from perinatally infected children were analyzed in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region and nef in order to investigate associations of viral variation and disease progression. Four long-term survivors who reached 10 years of age or older, and four rapid progressors who survived less than 2 years, participated in this study. LTR sequences of multiple independent viral variants from each individual were compared. No sequence pattern within the LTR consistently distinguished long-term survivors from rapid progressors or vice versa. Deletions and insertions within transcription factor binding sites of the LTR and nef ranging from 8 to 341 bp were found in viral variants from the eldest long-term survivor (LTS047). These deletions and duplications may be associated with the survival of LTS047 via an unknown mechanism. Among all children in this study, the sites in the untranslated region (NF-kappaB, SP1, and TATA box) were more conserved than the sites in the nef/LTR overlap region (NFAT, purine-rich region, USF, TCF1alpha), reflecting the importance of the sites in the untranslated region for viral replication. A mutation in the E box motif within the USF site among the sequences from a long-term survivor (LTS113) is predicted to disrupt protein binding and may be associated with slow disease progression. Mutations of the SP1-III site in a rapid progressor (RP056) indicate that this site is not necessary for rapid disease progression."
1433,0.001,1.0000,"Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a possible treatment for acute or chronic liver failure due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but reinfection of the graft can be a serious complication. The aim of this study was to monitor HBV markers, to analyse pre-core-/core-mutations as well as to identify the viral population causing reinfection after OLT, and to investigate the emergence or disappearance of these mutants in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Fifty-four pre-and posttransplant serum samples of 17 patients were analysed. All patients underwent OLT for HBV-related liver disease and had HBV-DNA before and after OLT. Total DNA was extracted from all sera and a 240 bp fragment comprising the pre-core region of HBV was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pre-core mutants of HBV were determined by direct sequencing of these PCR products and by sequencing of PCR clones. Eight of 17 patients were infected with pre-core wildtype HBV before OLT (group A). Seven of eight patients of group A were reinfected by pre-core wildtype HBV after OLT. In one of eight patients in addition to wildtype HBV a mutant strain (nt. 1899 G-->A) was detected. Nine of 17 patients were infected with pre-core mutant HBV before OLT (group B). Six of nine patients of group B were reinfected with the same mutant population; in one, an additional pre-core mutation emerged; two patients lost pre-core mutant HBV (nt. 1896 and 1899 G-->A). In one of the latter two, a pre-core start-codon mutant (nt. 1816 G-->T), not detectable before OLT, emerged, in the other a nt. 1897 G-->A stop-codon mutant persisted. Five patients of each group were followed-up for more than 24 (25 to 58) months on immunosuppressive therapy. In all five patients of group A, pre-core wildtype of HBV persisted during long-term follow up. Two of five patients of group B were infected stably with a stop-codon HBV-mutant nt. 1896. In three patients, the nt. 1896 stop-codon mutant disappeared during immunosuppressive therapy. However, in one of the latter three, an HBV stop-codon mutant nt. 1897 persisted. In conclusion, most patients who underwent OLT for HBV-related disease were reinfected with the same virus population that existed before OLT. In rare cases, new mutants emerged after OLT or preexisting mutants were lost. During long-term follow-up on immunosuppressive therapy, in the majority of patients pre-core mutants disappeared and wildtype HBV became the predominant virus strain."
1603,0.001,1.0000,"Lentiviral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) show great promise as gene carriers for future gene therapy. Insertion of a fragment containing the central polypurine tract (cPPT) in HIV-1 vector constructs is known to enhance transduction efficiency drastically, reportedly by facilitating the nuclear import of HIV-1 cDNA through a central DNA flap. We have studied the impact of the cPPT on the kinetics of HIV-1 vector transduction by real-time PCR. The kinetics of total HIV-1 DNA, two-long-terminal-repeat (2-LTR) circles, and, by an Alu-PCR, integrated proviral DNA were monitored. About 6 to 12 h after transduction, the total HIV-1 DNA reached a maximum level, followed by a steep decrease. The 2-LTR circles peaked after 24 to 48 h and were diluted upon cell division. Integration of HIV-1 DNA was first detected at 12 h postinfection. When HIV-1 vectors that contained the cPPT were used, DNA synthesis was similar but a threefold higher amount of 2-LTR circles was detected, confirming the impact on nuclear import. Moreover, a 10-fold increase in the amount of integrated DNA was observed in the presence of the cPPT. Only in the absence of the cPPT was a saturation in 2-LTR circle formation seen at a high multiplicity of infection, suggesting a role for the cPPT in overcoming a barrier to the nuclear import of HIV-1 DNA. A major effect of the central DNA flap on the juxtaposition of both LTRs is unlikely, since transduction with HIV-1 vectors containing ectopic cPPT fragments resulted in increased amounts of 2-LTR circles as well as integrated DNA. Inhibitors of transduction by cPPT-containing HIV vectors were also studied by real-time PCR. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine (AZT) and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor alpha-APA clearly inhibited viral DNA synthesis, whereas integrase inhibitors such as the diketo acid L-708,906 and the pyranodipyrimidine V-165 specifically inhibited integration."
3617,0.001,1.0000,"In vivo infection of monocytes/macrophages by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been investigated in many studies since these cells were suggested to provide a reservoir for the virus. In this study, we wanted to find out whether HIV provirus could be detected in circulating monocytes and whether it could be compared with the provirus found in T lymphocytes (T-Ly). Twenty-one seropositive subjects were studied. The amplification method (PCR) was used with three different primer pairs (in gag, env, and long terminal repeat regions of the viral genome) to detect the HIV-1 genome in monocytes and T-Ly separated by an immunomagnetic isolation technique. Of 21 monocyte samples, 13 (61.9%) were positive with at least one primer pair. Furthermore, the provirus harboured in 9 of those 13 monocyte-positive samples differed, with respect to pattern of primer response, from the provirus found in T-Ly. When comparing primer responses of monocytes and T-Ly, most of the differences were found to have occurred with the env primers (8 of 9 cases). Dilution experiments with the 8 E5 cell line revealed that 9 of 12 T-Ly contained 15-150 HIV DNA copies per 150,000 cells while 8 of 11 positive monocytes contained less than 15 copies. However, monocyte samples from two asymptomatic individuals and an AIDS patient showed high levels of HIV DNA, comparable to those obtained in T-Ly. Finally, it was also found that the monocyte-positive subjects were more immunosuppressed than the negative ones, as shown by the total CD4 count of both groups (means of 269 T4/mm3 and 573 T4/mm3, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3843,0.001,1.0000,"Pulmonary hypertension is an important cause of dyspnoea in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) patients. The effect highly active antiretroviral therapy on pulmonary artery pressure has been an area of controversy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of antiretroviral therapy on pulmonary hypertension in HIV patients. This prospective cohort study was performed in a peripheral medical college of West Bengal with 88 patients from October 2008 to September 2011. By echocardiography, pulmonary artery pressure was recorded before initiation of antiretroviral therapy. After one year of antiretroviral therapy repeat echocardiography was done and pulmonary artery pressure was evaluated. The values were analysed. The present study showed that highly active antiretroviral therapy improves pulmonary artery pressure in HIV/AIDS patients if instituted at early stages (WHO classes I and II). However, at more advanced stages of pulmonary artery hypertension, it does not have any significant effect on reduction of the same. The present study documents that early detection of pulmonary artery hypertension in HIV/AIDS patients is essential and prompt institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy should be considered in them even when those patients do not fulfill the conventional criteria for initiation of this treatment."
8189,0.001,1.0000,"The purpose of this report is to determine the influence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic on medical students' training and career plans through a prospective, anonymous self-administered survey of 10 Likert-scaled (1 strongly agree to 5 strongly disagree) responses to statements assessing attitude toward patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adequacy of knowledge and experience with HIV, and influence of HIV on career choices. The study was done at a major AIDS referral university teaching hospital. The participants were first- through fourth-year medical students in spring 1990. A 72% (of 451 students) response revealed that both surgery and emergency medicine were perceived as high risk of exposure specialties. Students indicated an overall willingness to care for HIV-positive patients (mean, 2.54) and a general adequacy of knowledge and experience (mean 2.54). The AIDS epidemic has had little influence for training, future career, and practice locations (mean, 4.06). Responses differed by class year. The later class years were more willing to care for HIV patients (P < .001) and indicated more knowledge and experience with HIV (P < .001). Influence on career, training and practice location choices were without class trend. In contrast to some studies, this group of medical students had relatively positive attitudes toward patients with HIV and were not particularly influenced by the AIDS epidemic regarding career choices."
9940,0.001,1.0000,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related non-Hodgkin lymphomas (AIDS-NHL) are thought to arise because of loss of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-specific cellular immunity. Here, an investigation was done to determine whether cellular immunity to EBV is lost because of physical loss or dysfunction of EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells. Data on EBV-specific cellular immunity were correlated with EBV load. For comparison, individuals who progressed to AIDS with opportunistic infections (AIDS-OI) and long-term asymptomatics (LTAs) were studied. The number of virus-specific T cells was detected using tetrameric HLA-EBV-peptide complexes; function of these EBV-specific T cells was determined using the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) Elispot assay. It was observed that EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells were present in normal numbers in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. However, their functional capacity was decreased compared with HIV(-) individuals. In AIDS-NHL patients, EBV-specific T cells were not physically lost in the course of HIV-1 infection but showed progressive loss of their capability to produce IFN-gamma in response to EBV peptides. This loss of function correlated with lower CD4(+) T-cell numbers and was accompanied by increasing EBV load. In HIV-1-infected LTA individuals, in whom CD4(+) T-cell numbers were maintained, and progressors to AIDS-OI, IFN-gamma-producing EBV-specific T cells were stable and EBV load remained stable or decreased in the course of HIV infection, suggestive of immune control. Our data indicate that functional loss of EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells with a concomitant increase in EBV load may play a role in the pathogenesis of AIDS-NHL."
7267,0.001,1.0000,"Nosocomial transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is a recognized risk in health care settings, and is a particular concern in settings where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons receive care. TB control guidelines have been effective in prevention of nosocomial TB outbreaks and protection of patients and health care workers. In 1993 a South Florida academic medical center noted an increase in TB cases, particularly in HIV-infected persons who had been inpatients. A multidisciplinary team developed an HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway as an intervention to deter nosocomial transmission of TB. The pathway was implemented in 1995 on the Special Immunology/Infectious Disease (SI/ID) inpatient unit. This paper describes an evaluation study conducted to determine the effectiveness of the pathway as an intervention to deter nosocomial TB in relation to two areas: (1) early identification of HIV-infected patients with potential TB, followed by immediate placement in respiratory isolation and (2) protection of SI/ID unit personnel from occupational TB exposure. A retrospective review was conducted in June 1999 on the medical records of all patients who had been placed on the HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway from 1995-1998. A review was also done of the medical center's confirmed TB cases, and employee health records for tuberculin skin testing (TST) of employees during this time period. The review demonstrated that all HIV-infected patients with confirmed TB had been identified, placed on the pathway and admitted to respiratory isolation at the onset of hospital admission, deterring the potential for a nosocomial TB outbreak. However, in 1998 two SI/ID staff converted from a nonreactive to a reactive TST. Although the pathway was only partially successful in TB protection for staff members, other factors may have caused the TST conversions. A study recommendation is that institutions develop an HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway, along with a Rule Out TB Pathway for patients who are not HIV-infected but present with symptoms that may be indicative of TB infection."
9991,0.001,1.0000,"Since the identification of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) as the etiologic agent of AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), many efforts have been made to stop the AIDS pandemic. A major success of medical research has been the development of the highly active antiretroviral therapy and its availability to an increasing number of people worldwide, with a considerable effect on survival. However, a safe and effective vaccine able to prevent and eradicate the HIV pandemic is still lacking. Clinical trials and preclinical proof-of-concept studies in nonhuman primate (NHP) models have provided insights into potential correlates of protection against the HIV-1 infection, which include broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), non-neutralizing antibodies targeting the variable loops 1 and 2 (V1V2) regions of the HIV-1 envelope (Env), polyfunctional antibody, and Env-specific T-cell responses. In this review, we provide a brief overview of different HIV-1 vaccine approaches and discuss the current understanding of the cellular and humoral correlates of HIV-1 immunity."
7737,0.001,1.0000,"We previously reported that infectivities of human and other non-human lentiviruses including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are activated by desialylation of the virion surface [H. Hu et al., J Virol 70: 7,462-7,470 (1996)]. The present study was designed to determine whether neuraminidase (NA) is useful for isolation of HIV-1 from patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or CD4+ cells isolated from the PBMC of infected individuals were cocultured with PBMC or CD4+ cells from uninfected healthy donors, and the efficiency and frequency of virus isolation in the presence of NA were compared with those by a routine conventional procedure. In a total of 41 isolation trials from 28 individuals, the presence of NA markedly increased the frequency of isolation. Furthermore, both the day when virus was first detected and the day when the virus titer was the highest in the cultures were significantly earlier in the presence of NA than in the absence of NA. The deduced amino acid sequences of the V2 and V3 regions of gp120 were identical or very similar between the isolates obtained in the presence or absence of NA, suggesting that both isolation procedures selected a similar population. NA was thus found to facilitate HIV-1 isolation and its use is recommended particularly when isolation is negative by the conventional procedures."
8549,0.001,1.0000,"A distinct group of cancers particularly threaten human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people. Most HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated cancers have a substantial component of viral etiology. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HHV8), human papillomavirus (HPV), and HIV have been implicated in the etiology of cancers in AIDS. The molecular mechanisms by which HPV, EBV, HHV8, and HIV persist and cause cancer are summarized. The viral etiology of AIDS-associated cancers is important because pharmacologic and immunologic strategies to prevent or attack persistent or latent virus infection and cell growth transformation may be useful in preventing and treating these cancers. Effective immune attack on latent and persistent virus infection will require enhanced cellular immune responses. Such responses may be achievable through active immunization or by in vitro expansion of viral and host specific cytotoxic and helper T lymphocytes. Enhanced knowledge of clinically applied T-cell immunology may also be useful in preventing and treating HIV infection and other opportunistic infections in HIV-infected people."
9922,0.001,1.0000,"Transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) usually results in outgrowth of viruses with macrophage-tropic phenotype and consensus non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) V3 loop sequences, despite the presence of virus with broader host range and the syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype in the blood of many donors. We examined proviruses in contemporaneous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and non-spermatozoal semen mononuclear cells (NSMC) of five HIV-1-infected individuals to determine if this preferential outgrowth could be due to compartmentalization and thus preferential transmission of viruses of the NSI phenotype from the male genital tract. Phylogenetic reconstructions of approximately 700-bp sequences covering the second constant region through the fifth variable region (C2 to V5) of the viral envelope gene revealed distinct variant populations in the blood versus the semen in two patients with AIDS and in one asymptomatic individual (patient 613), whereas similar variant populations were found in both compartments in two other asymptomatic individuals. Variants with amino acids in the V3 loop that predict the SI phenotype were found in both AIDS patients and in patient 613; however, the distribution of these variants between the two compartments was not consistent. SI variants were found only in the PBMC of one AIDS patient but only in the NSMC of the other, while they were found in both compartments in patient 613. It is therefore unlikely that restriction of SI variants from the male genital tract accounts for the observed NSI transmission bias. Furthermore, no evidence for a semen-specific signature amino acid sequence was detected."

We studied these factors and the evolution of HIV-1 resistance in response to LPV/r in a prospective study of patients receiving LPV/r under a temporary authorization in Bordeaux, France. HIV-1 PR and reverse transcriptase sequences were determined at baseline LPV/r for all the patients and at month 3 (M3) and M6 in the absence of response to treatment. pK measurements were determined at M1 and M3. Virological failure (VF) was defined as a plasma viral load >or=400 copies/ml at M3. A multivariate analysis of the predictors of VF, including clinical and biological characteristics and the treatment history of the patients, was performed. The PR gene sequence at M0, including individual mutations or a previously defined LPV mutation score (D. J. Kempf, J. D. Isaacson, M. S. King, S. C. Brun, Y. Xu, K. Real, B. M. Bernstein, A. J. Japour, E. Sun, and R. A. Rode, J. Virol. 75:7262-7269, 2001), and the individual exposure to LPV were also included covariates. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled. Thirty-four percent had a virological response at M3. An LPV mutation score of >5 mutations, the presence of the PR I54V mutation at baseline, a high number of previous PIs, prior therapy with ritonavir or indinavir, absence of coprescription of efavirenz, and a lower exposure to LPV or lower LPV trough concentrations were independently associated with VF on LPV/r. Additional PI resistance mutations, including primary mutation I50V, could be selected in patients failing on LPV/r. Genotypic and pK parameters should be used to optimize the virological response to LPV/r in PI-experienced patients and to avoid further viral evolution."

HBV core promoter overlaps partially with HBx coding sequence, so the nucleotide 1762 and 1764 mutations induce HBV X protein (HBx) 130 and 131 substitutions. We sought to elucidate the impact of HBx mutations on HCC development. Chronically HBV-infected patients were enrolled in this study: 42 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 23 liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, and 31 HCC patients. Direct sequencing showed HBx131, HBx130, HBx5, HBx94, and HBx38 amino acid mutations were common in HCC patients. Of various mutations, HBx130+HBx131 (double) mutations and HBx5+HBx130+HBx131 (triple) mutations were significantly high in HCC patients. Double and triple mutations increased the risk for HCC by 3.75-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.101 to 12.768, P = 0.033) and 5.34-fold (95% CI = 1.65 to 17.309, P = 0.005), respectively, when HCC patients were compared to CHB patients. Functionally, there were significantly higher levels of NF-κB activity in cells with the HBx5 mutant and with the double mutants than that of wild-type cells and the triple-mutant cells. The triple mutation did not increase NF-κB activity. Other regulatory pathways seem to exist for NF-κB activation. In conclusion, a specific HBx mutation may contribute to HCC development by activating NF-κB activity. The HBx5 mutation in genotype C2 HBV appears to be a risk factor for the development of HCC and may be used to predict the clinical outcomes of patients with chronic HBV infection."
3609,0.001,1.0000,"Few reports have examined the impact of HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in resource-limited settings where there are fewer regimen choices and limited pretherapy/posttherapy resistance testing. In this study, we examined TDR prevalence in Kampala and Mbarara, Uganda and assessed its virologic consequences after antiretroviral therapy initiation. We sequenced the HIV-1 protease/reverse transcriptase from n=81 and n=491 treatment-naive participants of the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes (UARTO) pilot study in Kampala (AMU 2002-2004) and main cohort in Mbarara (MBA 2005-2010). TDR-associated mutations were defined by the WHO 2009 surveillance mutation list. Posttreatment viral load data were available for both populations. Overall TDR prevalence was 7% (Kampala) and 3% (Mbarara) with no significant time trend. There was a slight but statistically nonsignificant trend indicating that the presence of TDR was associated with a worse treatment outcome. Virologic suppression (≤400 copies/ml within 6 months posttherapy initiation) was achieved in 87% and 96% of participants with wildtype viruses versus 67% and 83% of participants with TDR (AMU, MBA p=0.2 and 0.1); time to suppression (log-rank p=0.3 and p=0.05). Overall, 85% and 96% of study participants achieved suppression regardless of TDR status. Surprisingly, among the TDR cases, approximately half still achieved suppression; the presence of pretherapy K103N while on nevirapine and fewer active drugs in the first regimen were most often observed with failures. The majority of patients benefited from the local HIV care system even without resistance monitoring. Overall, TDR prevalence was relatively low and its presence did not always imply treatment failure."
4656,0.001,1.0000,"The interaction of viral and host factors is believed to determine not only the risk for initial human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) acquisition but also the course of the infection. Genetic polymorphisms in the chemokine receptors and their ligands were related to the susceptibility and resistance to HIV-1 infection. A polymorphism in the conserved 3' untranslated region of the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1) gene, which encodes a ligand of the CXCR4 receptor, has been related either to delayed progression to AIDS or to rapid disease progression and death. Global, regional, and ethnic distributions of frequencies of SDF1 genotypes and of the SDF1-3'A allele vary significantly. Although the HIV-1 epidemic is increasing in Brazil, little information about the frequencies of host genetic mutations related to HIV/AIDS resistance in the Brazilian population has been reported. To address this question, this study was carried out in order to determine the frequencies of the SDF1 polymorphism and the SDF1-3'A allele on 1061 genomic DNA samples purified from peripheral blood cells of 136 healthy individuals (group 1), 147 HIV-1-exposed seronegative individuals (group 2), 161 HIV-1-infected asymptomatic individuals and with CD4(+) T-cells count 350 mm(-3) (group 3), and 617 HIV-1-infected individuals with AIDS and/or CD4(+) T-cells count < 350 mm(-3) (group 4). The frequencies of the SDF1-3'A homozygous mutation were 3.7%, 6.1%, 4.3%, and 5.3% among groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (P = 0.5120). The overall frequency of the SDF1-3'A allele was 0. 1984 and did not differ among the four groups (P = 0.2744). The results underscore the global distribution of the SDF1 polymorphism and the hypothesis that the SDF1-3'A allele, itself, may not be sufficient to prevent the risk of HIV-1 infection and may be not related to the progression of the disease in the Brazilian population."

The aim of this observational study was to characterize the RPV pharmacokinetic profile, to quantify interpatient variability, and to identify potential factors that could influence drug exposure. RPV concentration data were collected from HIV-infected patients as part of routine therapeutic drug monitoring performed in our center (Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology). A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with NONMEM by comparing various structural models. The influence of demographic and clinical covariates, as well as frequent genetic polymorphisms in 5 genes (CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*17, UGT1A1*28, and UGT1A4*2), on RPV elimination was explored. A total of 325 plasma concentration measurements were obtained from 249 HIV-positive patients. Plasma concentrations ranged from 12 to 255 ng/ml. A one-compartment model with zero-order absorption best characterized RPV pharmacokinetics. The average RPV clearance (CL) was 11.7 liters/h, the average volume of distribution was 401 liters, and the mean absorption time was 4 h. The interinterindividual variability (IIV) for CL was estimated to be 33%. None of the available demographic or genetic covariates showed any influence on RPV pharmacokinetics, but 29% of the patients were predicted to present minimal concentrations below the recently identified target cutoff value of 50 ng/ml. The variability in RPV pharmacokinetics appears to be lower than that for most other antiretroviral drugs. However, under the standard regimen of 25 mg daily, a significant number of patients might be underdosed. It remains to be investigated whether the underexposure has an impact on the development of resistance while patients are on maintenance therapy."

Anti-HBs was detected initially in 138 patients (65%). Sixteen patients (8%) were HBsAg positive at entry. Fourteen had chronic HBV infection of whom 12 initially were positive for HBeAg and HBV DNA; 11 remained positive during follow-up, whereas one seroconverted to anti-HBe and lost HBV DNA. Two patients with chronic HBV infection were initially negative for HBeAg and HBV DNA: one later had reactivated HBV replication and one cleared HBeAg following onset of hepatitis D infection. The last two HBsAg-positive patients had resolving acute HBV infection. Six of the 57 patients who initially were negative for HBV markers acquired HBV infection during follow-up. Four of these six patients developed chronic infection whereas two patients had acute subclinical resolving hepatitis. In addition, four patients became HBsAg positive with their last serum samples, possibly indicating reactivation of HBV infection following progressive immunological and clinical deterioration. None of the patients developed clinical symptoms that could be ascribed to HBV infection, and transaminase elevations were only sporadically recorded. It is concluded that acquisition of HBV infections is not infrequent in HIV-seropositive patients with immune deficiency. Furthermore, the course of both previously established chronic HBV infection and newly acquired HBV infection is modified in such patients, whereas reactivation of past HBV infection seems to be a rare event."
2598,0.001,1.0000,"In 1994, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was transmitted to four HIV seropositive patients attending the Department of Angiology, University Clinics, Frankfurt am Main, by the administration of Gammagard. The patients were suffering from thrombocytopenia and received betweeen 20 and 30 g of the contaminated lot 93F21AB11. GBV-C/HGV RNA could be amplified from the Gammagard lot 93F21AB11 using 5'NCR and NS5 primer pairs. All the four patients were negative in the GBV-C/HGV RT-PCR prior to therapy and until the end of the follow-up period. GBV-C/HGV IgG antibodies to the putative envelope (E2) were detected using the E2 HGV-env kit (Boehringer-Mannheim, Germany) in Gammagard lot 93F21AB11 and in one patient before donation of immunoglobulin. Anti-E2 seroconversion was observed in one recipient, the other two patients remained anti-E2 seronegative until the end of the observation period. It is concluded that there is no direct evidence for transmission of GBV-C/HGV by contaminated intravenous immunoglobulin since GBV-C/HGV RNA was not detected in the recipients up to 1 year after administration."
9460,0.001,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and the clinical outcome associated with organ transplantation from increased infectious risk donors (IRD). We retrospectively identified all adult deceased IRD referred to the Nord Italia Transplant program coordinating center from November 2006 to November 2011. All potential donors were screened for social risk factors that may increase the risk of donor-derived infection with human immunodeficiency (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). All recipients were followed monthly for the first 6 months post-transplant. A total of 86 potential IRD were identified during the study period. Three hundred and seventy-nine organs from IRD were offered to the transplant centers, but only 185 (48.8%) were used for transplantation. Organs from IRD were transplanted into 174 recipients. The complete follow-up data were available for 152 of 174 (87.3%) recipients. During a mean follow-up of 11.7 months (median 12; range 2.4-12), no transmission of HIV, HBV, or syphilis was documented by serology and nucleic acid testing (NAT) testing. Two patients transplanted with organs from HCV-RNA-positive donors, as expected, developed post-transplant HCV infection. In conclusion, the use of organs from IRD was associated with a safe increase in the transplant procedures in our country."
3867,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is characterized by persistent replication of a complex mixture of viruses termed a ""quasispecies."" Transmission is generally associated with a stringent population bottleneck characterized by infection by limited numbers of ""transmitted/founder"" (T/F) viruses. Characterization of T/F genomes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been integral to studies of transmission, immunopathogenesis, and vaccine development. Here, we describe the identification of complete T/F genomes of HCV by single-genome sequencing of plasma viral RNA from acutely infected subjects. A total of 2,739 single-genome-derived amplicons comprising 10,966,507 bp from 18 acute-phase and 11 chronically infected subjects were analyzed. Acute-phase sequences diversified essentially randomly, except for the poly(U/UC) tract, which was subject to polymerase slippage. Fourteen acute-phase subjects were productively infected by more than one genetically distinct virus, permitting assessment of recombination between replicating genomes. No evidence of recombination was found among 1,589 sequences analyzed. Envelope sequences of T/F genomes lacked transmission signatures that could distinguish them from chronic infection viruses. Among chronically infected subjects, higher nucleotide substitution rates were observed in the poly(U/UC) tract than in envelope hypervariable region 1. Fourteen full-length molecular clones with variable poly(U/UC) sequences corresponding to seven genotype 1a, 1b, 3a, and 4a T/F viruses were generated. Like most unadapted HCV clones, T/F genomes did not replicate efficiently in Huh 7.5 cells, indicating that additional cellular factors or viral adaptations are necessary for in vitro replication. Full-length T/F HCV genomes and their progeny provide unique insights into virus transmission, virus evolution, and virus-host interactions associated with immunopathogenesis."
2596,0.001,1.0000,"This study describes the prevalence and association of Torque teno virus (TTV) infection with blood-transmitted viral hepatitis including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). TTV infection was diagnosed by detection of TTV-DNA in serum, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. TTV-DNA was estimated in a total number of one hundred patients with CRF and in 100 voluntary blood donors as controls. The markers of HBV and HCV were also tested in sera samples of these patients. TTV-DNA was detected in 39 of 100 patients (39%) with CRF and in 27 of 100 (27%) healthy controls. The analysis of the results demonstrated HBsAg, IgM anti-HBc, anti-HCV, and HCV core antigen in 5.0, 3.0, 6.0, and 4.0% of patients, respectively. This study could not show any association of TTV with HBV and HCV infections for the transmission pattern or any impact on severity of diseases caused by these viruses in CRF patients. TTV also could not show any association with demographic characteristics of patients, duration of dialysis, number of blood transfusions and renal/liver function of the patients. As such, this study concludes that TTV appears as a benign pathogen, showing no sign of renal/liver damage or any change in the severity of diseases caused by blood-borne hepatitis viruses."
254,0.001,1.0000,"Although herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is not regarded as an opportunistic infection, the occurrence of HSE in immunocompromised patients has been documented and the suggestion made that unusual clinical and neuropathologic features characterize the disorder in this population. To further characterize HSE as it affects the immunodeficient, the authors reviewed the clinical and pathological findings in three immunocompromised patients with autopsy-proven HSE. Two patients had cancer (one with lymphoma and another with glioblastoma multiforme), one was known to be human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1)-seropositive and a second was suspected of harboring underlying HIV-1 infection. Two were receiving dexamethasone at onset of HSE. All had fever, mental status changes and new, focal neurological deficits or worsening of established deficits. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis was absent or minimal and head computerized tomographic (CT) scans, performed in all cases, were unrevealing. No patient was clinically suspected of having HSE, only one received acyclovir (for concurrent mucocutaneous herpes) and HSE played a major role in all deaths. Autopsy revealed an unusual form of HSE characterized by a noninflammatory, pseudoischemic histological presentation and the unexpected persistence of viral antigens in abundance despite survival beyond the clinical stage during which inflammatory responses usually peak and productive brain infection wanes. The incidence of HSE in the immunocompromised may be underestimated. Preexistent neurological disease, a noninflammatory CSF profile and negative CT scan may confound the diagnosis in this population, a typical clinical presentation notwithstanding. Increased clinical suspicion, the use of magnetic resonance imaging and polymerase chain reaction analysis of CSF for herpes simplex virus nucleic acid sequences may permit more rapid diagnosis and treatment. The absence of inflammatory infiltrates in some fatal cases of HSE suggests that an intact immune response is not requisite to the devastating neurological injury characteristic of this disorder."
4976,0.001,1.0000,"Since hepatitis-B immune prophylaxis is possible, HIV infection could become the most important risk of infection facing medical personnel. Today, it must be assumed that HIV infection almost always leads to the fatal disease AIDS. The principal source of infection for medical personnel is patients' blood. The disease is usually transmitted parenterally, as a result of inoculation by a needle prick or similar injury. Blood contact with non-intact skin or mucosae can also lead to infection. In prospective studies, HIV infection was found in approximately 0.5% of cases following needle-prick injuries with anti-HIV-positive blood. The HIV infection risk for medical personnel thus ultimately depends on the frequency of needle prick-type injuries and the number of anti-HIV-positive patients. Assuming that there are 50,000-100,000 anti-HIV-positive persons in the Federal Republic of Germany (Federal Health Authority estimate) the occupational risk to the life of a surgeon sustaining 40 injuries per year could be over 1%. In densely-populated areas with above average contamination of patients a higher HIV infection risk must be expected. An increase in contamination in the next few years would also lead to an increased risk of infection."
5091,0.001,1.0000,"HLA-B*5701 is the host factor most strongly associated with slow HIV-1 disease progression, although risk of progression may vary among patients carrying this allele. The interplay between HIV-1 evolutionary rate variation and risk of progression to AIDS in HLA-B*5701 subjects was studied using longitudinal viral sequences from high-risk progressors (HRPs) and low-risk progressors (LRPs). Posterior distributions of HIV-1 genealogies assuming a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock were used to estimate the absolute rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions for different set of branches. Rates of viral evolution, as well as in vitro viral replication capacity assessed using a novel phenotypic assay, were correlated with various clinical parameters. HIV-1 synonymous substitution rates were significantly lower in LRPs than HRPs, especially for sets of internal branches. The viral population infecting LRPs was also characterized by a slower increase in synonymous divergence over time. This pattern did not correlate to differences in viral fitness, as measured by in vitro replication capacity, nor could be explained by differences among subjects in T cell activation or selection pressure. Interestingly, a significant inverse correlation was found between baseline CD4+ T cell counts and mean HIV-1 synonymous rate (which is proportional to the viral replication rate) along branches representing viral lineages successfully propagating through time up to the last sampled time point. The observed lower replication rate in HLA-B*5701 subjects with higher baseline CD4+ T cell counts provides a potential model to explain differences in risk of disease progression among individuals carrying this allele.

7808,0.001,1.0000,"In previous studies, genital ulcers in men have been found to be associated with increased risk of HIV-1 seroconversion. To further explore this association male patients attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Nairobi for either urethritis (controls, n = 276) or a genital ulcer (cases, n = 607) were compared with respect to sexual behaviour, presence of HIV-1 antibody and circumcision status. Patients were followed to study risk factors for incident genital ulcers and HIV-1 seroconversion. At entry, being married was associated with higher prevalence of HIV-1 (OR = 1.76) and genital ulcers (OR = 1.42). Lack of circumcision was associated with both HIV-1 infection (OR = 4.67) and the presence of a genital ulcer (OR = 2.23). Genital ulcers were also associated with HIV-1 infection (OR = 1.87) independent of circumcision status. On follow-up, HIV-1 seropositivity was associated with incident genital ulcers. It is argued that the association between genital ulcers and HIV-1 infection may be more complex than ulcers simply being a risk factor for HIV-1 infection, and that HIV-1 infection may either increase the risk of acquiring a genital ulcer, or HIV-1 infection and genital ulcers may have some unknown risk factor in common."
8184,0.001,1.0000,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is widely used to treat patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We investigated the effect of TDF on renal insufficiency in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).A consecutive cohort analysis was applied to CHB patients taking prescribed TDF from January 2012 to May 2016 at Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital. Alterations over time in corrected calcium, phosphate, creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were analyzed using the generalized estimating equation method. The percentage increase in creatinine from baseline to the maximum creatinine level (delta creatinine) was compared according to the underlying disease using the Mann-Whitney U test. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to determine risk factors associated with renal insufficiency.The baseline creatinine, eGFR, corrected calcium, and phosphate levels were 0.72 ± 0.01 mg/dL (mean ± SD), 106.37 ± 1.06 mL/min/1.73 m, 8.82 ± 0.04 mg/dL, and 3.42 ± 0.05 mg/dL, respectively. The creatinine level had increased significantly at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 weeks, while the eGFR level had decreased significantly at these 5 time points. Multivariate analysis confirmed that age ≥60 years and the baseline bilirubin level were independently associated with the risk of renal insufficiency. Delta creatinine was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) than in patients without DM.Renal function was decreased from baseline in CHB patients receiving TDF therapy, which indicates that the renal function of patients undergoing treatment with TDF should be monitored regularly. Old age, DM, and serum bilirubin were risk factors for the development of renal insufficiency in CHB patients receiving TDF therapy."
298,0.001,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to investigate the clastogenic activity of plasma ultrafiltrates from HIV-1 infected patients. Clastogenic factors are chromosome-damaging agents with low molecular weight (< 10,000 daltons) which cause chromosome aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges, DNA strand breakage, and gene mutation. They have first been described in the plasma of irradiated persons, but they are also found in hereditary breakage syndromes and chronic inflammatory diseases with autoimmune reactions. Their formation and their clastogenic effects are modulated by superoxide anion radicals. We analyzed a total of 22 HIV-1 positive patients in comparison to 20 reference plasma samples from healthy HIV negative blood donors of similar age. The plasma ultrafiltrates (filter cutoff 10,000 daltons) from patients induced a statistically significant increase in chromosomal breakage in the cytogenetic test system (20.5 +/- 6.8 aberrations per 100 cells), while no increase was observed in test cultures exposed to plasma ultrafiltrates from healthy blood donors (6.3 +/- 2.9 aberrations per 100 cells). The breakage values were slightly, but not significantly, lower in the 10 patients with more than 200 T-helper cells/ml (18 +/- 4 aberrations per 100 cells), than in the 12 patients with less than 200 T-helper cells/ml (22.3 +/- 7.9 aberrations per 100 cells). HIV patients with high clastogenic activity (induction of more than 20 aberrations per 100 cells, range 20 to 39) showed higher plasma levels for malondialdehyde than those with lower clastogenic activity (less than 20 aberrations per 100 cells, range 12 to 18). However, the difference was statistically not significant. Another lipid peroxidation product, 4-hydroxynonenal, was increased equally in both groups. There were no significant differences in water- and lipid-soluble plasma antioxidants between the low- and high-breakage group. In agreement with previous findings, the clastogenic effects of plasma ultrafiltrates in the test cultures were reduced by the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase. The presence of clastogenic factors in the plasma of HIV patients is further evidence for a prooxidant state in these persons. Since clastogenic factor formation appears to occur at an early stage of the disease, it may be significant for virus release or activation, because of the superoxide anion stimulating effects of clastogenic factors. From a practical standpoint, clastogenic factors may be useful for evaluation of promising drugs."

A retrospective questionnaire survey was conducted of infants and children with HIV exposure or infection evaluated by pediatric HIV referral centers in the United States comprising the pediatric units or subunits of the Pediatric Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Clinical Trials Group (PACTG). Seventy of 72 sites during a mean period of 5 (range, 1 to 12) years participated in this study and had provided care for 14,038 patients. There were 75 cumulative total cases of tuberculosis disease seen since each site was established. Therapy for asymptomatic infection was given to another 40 children and for tuberculosis exposure to 71 children. Annualized case rates were 478/100,000 for sites established in 1990 to 1992, 117/100,000 for 1988 to 1989, 63/100,000 for 1986 to 1987 and 58/100,000 for 1981 to 1985 (P = 0.05, Spearman's p test for trend). By comparison, the 1992 age-specific tuberculosis case rate for all U.S. children < 5 years was 5.5/100,000.

8624,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of our study was to determine a minimum threshold CD4 count for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation in HIV-infected patients. A schema using longitudinal data from a clinical cohort was designed. The presenting CD4 counts of asymptomatic HIV-infected patients in Hong Kong were evaluated in relation to their progression to AIDS within 1 year of diagnosis of HIV infection. A graph was generated to depict the changes in the percentage of cumulative AIDS diagnoses for every 10 cell/microL increase in presenting CD4 count. Of 181 patients, 24 had developed AIDS within 1 year of diagnosis of HIV infection. Setting the CD4 count threshold at 150 cells/microL gave a good balance between the number of preventable AIDS-defining events and the number of non-AIDS patients initiating HAART. No extra AIDS-defining events occurred when the CD4 count threshold was reduced from 200 to 150 cells/microL, despite the addition of 13 more patients. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, presenting CD4 count was a significant predictor for AIDS occurrence. The relative hazard for AIDS occurrence of patients with presenting CD4 counts <or=150 cells/microL was 27-fold greater. We suggest a CD4 count of 150 cells/microL as the minimum threshold for HAART initiation in a cohort of Chinese HIV-infected patients. At this level, 20.8% of the AIDS-defining events could be prevented. While a cut-off of 200 cells/microL remains a standard for considering HAART initiation, the minimum threshold signifies a critical moment for timely intervention to be introduced."
6906,0.001,1.0000,"Following treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) monoinfection, HBV-specific T-cell responses increase significantly; however, little is known about the recovery of HBV-specific T-cell responses following HBV-active highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-HBV coinfected patients. HIV-HBV coinfected patients who were treatment naïve and initiating HBV-active HAART were recruited as part of a prospective cohort study in Thailand and followed for 48 weeks (n = 24). Production of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in both HBV- and HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells was quantified using intracellular cytokine staining on whole blood. Following HBV-active HAART, the median (interquartile range) log decline from week 0 to week 48 for HBV DNA was 5.8 log (range, 3.4 to 6.7) IU/ml, and for HIV RNA it was 3.1 (range, 2.9 to 3.5) log copies/ml (P < 0.001 for both). The frequency of HIV Gag-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses significantly decreased (IFN-gamma, P < 0.001; TNF-alpha, P = 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant change in the frequency (IFN-gamma, P = 0.21; TNF-alpha, P = 0.61; and IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, P = 0.11) or magnitude (IFN-gamma, P = 0.13; TNF-alpha, P = 0.13; and IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, P = 0.13) of HBV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses over 48 weeks of HBV-active HAART. Of the 14 individuals who were HBV e antigen (HBeAg) positive, 5/14 (36%) lost HBeAg during the 48 weeks of follow-up. HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected in 4/5 (80%) of patients prior to HBeAg loss. Results from this study show no sustained change in the HBV-specific CD8(+) T-cell response following HBV-active HAART. These findings may have implications for the duration of treatment of HBV in HIV-HBV coinfected patients, particularly in HBeAg-positive disease."
8150,0.001,1.0000,"Patients in whom virologic suppression is achieved with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) retain long-lived cellular reservoirs of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1); this retention is an obstacle to sustained control of infection. To assess the impact that initiating treatment during primary HIV-1 infection has on this cell population, we analyzed the decay kinetics of HIV-1 DNA and of infectivity associated with cells activated ex vivo in 27 patients who initiated therapy before or <6 months after seroconversion and in whom viremia was suppressed to <50 copies/mL. The clearance rates of cellular reservoirs could not be distinguished by these techniques (median half-life, 20 weeks) during the first year of HAART. The clearance of HIV-1 DNA slowed significantly during the subsequent 3 years of treatment (median half-life, 70 weeks), consistent with heterogeneous cellular reservoirs being present. Total cell-associated infectivity (CAI) after 1 year of treatment was undetectable (<0.07 infectious units/million cells [IUPM]) in most patients initiating treatment during primary infection either before (9/9) or <6 months after (6/8) seroconversion. In contrast, all 17 control patients who initiated HAART during chronic infection retained detectable CAI after 3-6 years of treatment (median reservoir size, 1.1 IUPM; P<.0005). These results suggest that treatment <6 months after seroconversion may facilitate long-term control of cellular reservoirs that maintain HIV-1 infection during treatment."

The efficacy of an additional booster dose in children with immune recovery on HAART remains unknown. This study was conducted to determine the response rate of HBV antibody after re-vaccination in HIV-infected children with immune recovery on HAART. Sixty-three successfully HAART-treated HIV-infected children with history of prior HBV vaccination received 10microg doses of recombinant HBV vaccine (Government Pharmaceutical Organization-Merieux Biological Product, Bangkok, Thailand) intramuscularly at 0, 2 and 6 months. The vaccine response rates were 17.4, 82.5, and 92.1% at 2, 6 and 7 months after the first dose of vaccine, respectively. Plasma HIV RNA level below the limit of detection at the time of re-vaccination was associated with successful vaccine response. HIV-infected children with immune recovery after HAART are likely to benefit from three-dose HBV re-vaccination."

In this study, the aim was to evaluate the vaccination coverage and immunity against HBV among HIV-infected individuals in South Brazil, and identify factors that are associated with compliance patterns and antibody reactivity. Three hundred HIV-infected men and women were included in this survey. The patients answered a standardized questionnaire, and vaccination cards were checked in order to assess hepatitis B vaccine status. A blood sample was collected for quantitative determination of antibody to hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBs). Participants were also evaluated for their CD4 cell count and HIV viral load. The overall vaccination coverage of HBV vaccination found in this study (57.4%) was lower than that was previously reported in South Brazil. Anti-HBs levels >10IU/L were observed in 47.0% of the studied population. A significant inequality in the coverage rates and antibody reactivity was found in favor of patients with better economic status. In conclusion, the results indicate the need for improvement in the HBV vaccination coverage among HIV carriers, in particular focusing on low-income individuals. "
9541,0.001,1.0000,"Differences in the uptake and time to initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the virological response to HAART, and survival from AIDS by transmission category were analyzed. A multicenter hospital-based cohort of HIV-infected patients attending 10 hospitals in Spain from January 1997 to December 2003 was used. Cross-checks with the National AIDS Registry were performed. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the impact of transmission category on time to HAART initiation, viral suppression (defined by first HIV-1 RNA viral load measurement <500 copies/ml after HAART), and survival from AIDS. Of 4643 patients, 73% were men and 56% were injecting drug users (IDUs). A statistically significant interaction was found between transmission category and previous non-HAART antiretroviral treatment (ART) (p < 0.05). Among ART naive patients, IDUs had a 33% lower risk of initiating HAART compared to men who have sex with men (MSM) [HR 0.67 (95% CI 0.57-0.79)]. No differences by transmission categories were seen among patients with prior non-HAART ART. IDUs had poorer viral load (VL) suppression than MSM [HR 0.86 (95% CI 0.74-0.99)] adjusting by baseline VL, AIDS diagnosis, and prior ART. Mortality from AIDS was two and a half times higher in IDUs than MSM [HR 2.51 (95% CI 1.03-6.1)]. Among patients who access the hospital network, IDUs have a lower uptake of HAART, have worse virological suppression, and have higher mortality after AIDS diagnosis. There is a need to extend the programs in order to enhance access and adherence of IDUs to HAART and consider the treatment of drug addiction as an integral part of the treatment for HIV infection."

In a series of 132 (65 anti-HIV positive) homosexual non-drug addicted men with chronic hepatitis B, the liver function was assessed with biochemical tests; the degree of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication was assessed with serum HBV DNA level and with immunoperoxidase staining of hepatitis B core (HBc) antigen on liver specimens; and the severity of liver lesions was assessed with an histology activity index. Anti-HIV-positive and anti-HIV-negative patients were not different for serum aspartate transaminase activity, bilirubin, prothrombin, and histology activity index. Anti-HIV-positive patients had lower serum alanine transaminase activity levels (P =.0001), lower serum albumin levels (P =.0009), and higher serum HBV DNA levels (P =.01). There was a higher prevalence of cirrhosis in anti-HIV-positive patients (P =.04).

9878,0.001,1.0000,"AY 9944 [AY; trans-1,4-bis(chlorobenzylaminomethyl)-cyclohexane dihydrochloride], an inhibitor of sterol synthesis, was found to help restore the normal mitogenic responses and cytokine profiles of peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from AIDS patients in vitro. Compared to untreated cells, the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected PBMCs precultured in the presence of AY exhibited a normal rate of either mitogen-induced or recall- and superantigen-induced proliferation. After 2 weeks in the presence of the drug, the percentage of dead CD4(+) cells in HIV-1-infected cultures was comparable to that observed in uninfected cultures, while over the same time interval it increased by three- to fivefold in HIV-1-infected cultures maintained in the absence of AY. AY also stimulated by 2- to 12-fold interleukin-12 (IL-12) and (gamma interferon production. For IL-12, this effect appears to be related to an increase in corresponding IL-12 p35 and IL-12 p40 mRNA levels. Moreover, AY restored the expression of the IL-2 receptor, which was severely impaired in HIV-1-infected PBMCs. Although the drug has no direct antiviral effect (it does not significantly inhibit reverse transcriptase activity measured in vitro), it might be considered a potential therapeutic agent for HIV-infected patients, in that it may correct viral infection-related immune system defects by indirectly enhancing the level of resistance to HIV and opportunistic infections."
5953,0.001,1.0000,"The oral deoxyguanosine nucleoside analogue entecavir (Baraclude®) has potent activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and a high genetic barrier to resistance. This article reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of entecavir in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients with decompensated liver disease, as well as summarizing its pharmacological properties. Entecavir 1 mg/day was more effective than adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg/day in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease, according to the results of a randomized, open-label, multicentre trial. Patients were either nucleos(t)ide naive or lamivudine experienced. The reduction from baseline in HBV DNA levels at week 24 (primary endpoint) was significantly greater with entecavir than with adefovir dipivoxil. The proportion of patients with HBV DNA levels of <300 copies/mL was also significantly greater with entecavir than with adefovir dipivoxil at weeks 24, 48 and 96, as was the proportion of patients with ALT normalization. Entecavir 0.5 or 1 mg/day, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg/day and a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 200 mg/300 mg per day were effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients with decompensated liver disease, according to the 48-week analysis of a randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial, primarily designed to examine tolerability endpoints. In this trial, over one-third of patients had received previous therapy with lamivudine for ≥6 months. The efficacy of entecavir in treatment-naive patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis did not significantly differ from that seen in patients with chronic hepatitis B or compensated cirrhosis (compensated group), according to the results of a prospective, nonrandomized study. After 6 or 12 months of entecavir treatment, there were no significant differences between the decompensated and compensated groups in virological, biochemical or serological endpoints. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, significant improvements from baseline in liver function were seen after 12 months of entecavir therapy. Oral entecavir was generally well tolerated in patients with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease, with most of the reported treatment-emergent adverse events consistent with decompensated liver disease. In the trial primarily designed to examine tolerability endpoints, there was no significant difference between patients receiving entecavir and those receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with or without emtricitabine in terms of the proportion of patients experiencing tolerability failure or the proportion of patients with confirmed increases in serum creatinine levels of ≥0.5 mg/dL above baseline or confirmed serum phosphorus levels of <2.0 mg/dL at week 48 (co-primary endpoints). It has been suggested that the risk of lactic acidosis associated with oral nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy is increased in patients with highly impaired liver function. However, only one case of lactic acidosis was reported among entecavir recipients across two clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease. Moreover, small studies found that the risk of lactic acidosis was not increased in patients with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease who received entecavir, compared with patients with non-HBV decompensated liver disease. In conclusion, entecavir is a valuable agent for the first-line treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients with decompensated liver disease."
2034,0.001,1.0000,"Due to their shared transmission route, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infections can be observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cases and are associated with more severe clinical courses. The detection of HBV DNA despite HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seronegativity is defined as occult HBV infections. According to the current seroepidemiological data, Turkey is classified as an intermediate HBV, low HIV endemic region. Occult HBV infections have previously been reported from Turkey but has not been investigated previously in HIV infected cohorts. The aim of this study was to identify occult HBV infections in HIV-infected persons. Twenty-eight HIV-positive cases followed-up at Hacettepe University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Unit were included in the study after informed consent. For the detection of HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HCV, commercial ELISA tests (Architect System, Abbott Diagnostics, USA) were employed. Absolute CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined via flow cytometry. HIV viral load was calculated via COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA) and the presence of HBV DNA was evaluated via COBAS TaqMan HBV Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA), in addition to a nested PCR assay targeting HBV S gene. The mean age of the study group was 43.2 (range between 27-65) years, 64.3% (18/28) of them were males and the mean duration of HIV infection was 4.2 (2-11) years. Mean CD4+ ve CD8+ T-cell counts were 414 ± 267 cells/mm3 and 854 ± 293 cells/mm3, respectively. Twenty-six (92.8%) cases were under highly-active anti-retroviral therapy at the time of the study, 88.5% of which included HBV-active drugs (lamivudine or tenofovir). HIV RNA were found negative in 11 (39.3%) patients, of those nine (81.8%) were the cases who treated with HBV-active antiretroviral therapy. HBsAg were negative in all of the 28 patients, while the positivity rates of anti-HBs and anti-HCV were 39.3% (11/28) and 3.6% (1/28), respectively. All samples were negative for HBV DNA via the commercial real-time PCR and in-house nested PCR assays. The absence of occult HBV in the study group may indicate the absence of occult HBV or suppression of viral replication due to the anti-retroviral therapy. In conclusion, further large-scale studies are required to fully understand the impact of occult HBV in HIV-infected patients in Turkey."
1252,0.001,1.0000,"We describe a HBsAg-positive patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent aggressive chemotherapy. After discontinuation of chemotherapy, he developed jaundice due to a reactivation of the hepatitis B. Serum HBeAg and HBV DNA turned positive, indicating active virus replication. Abdominal CT-scan showed a large solitary tumour mass in the liver and the serum alpha-fetoprotein level was extremely high, suggesting HBV-related hepatoma. After discontinuation of chemotherapy, the patient died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Throughout treatment of HBsAg-positive patients with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy, careful monitoring of serum aminotransferase levels and HBV DNA is essential. Aggressive chemotherapy may have to be discontinued or changed to a milder regimen if hepatitis occurs."
3515,0.001,1.0000,"To determine the safety and efficacy of ganciclovir treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection after liver transplantation, nine patients (seven males, two females; mean age, 38 years) with posttransplant HBV infection were treated with ganciclovir for 3 to 10 months. Ganciclovir was administered intravenously at an initial dose of 5 mg/kg/d and then increased to 10 mg/kg/d. Immunosuppressive drug therapy was maintained at low levels. There were no major side effects of ganciclovir therapy. Serum HBV DNA levels decreased by a mean of 90% (range, 42% to 100%), and four of nine patients had no measurable HBV DNA at the completion of therapy. Mean serum alanine aminotransferase levels decreased by 83%. Hepatic expression of HBV antigens and HBV DNA was assessed before and after therapy in six patients and found to be reduced in three patients. The histology activity index was also stabilized or improved in all patients. After discontinuation of therapy, four of nine patients underwent retreatment for 4- to 12-fold elevation of serum HBV DNA and/or biochemical and clinical relapse, that was severe in one patient. This pilot study shows the safety and efficacy of ganciclovir therapy for reducing HBV replication in patients with HBV infection after liver transplantation."
4979,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a common coinfection in HIV-infected patients, and significant liver disease and mortality occur as the result of this disease combination. Potent anti-HBV therapy is available and can be used to improve outcomes by suppressing HBV DNA. Many HBV agents have dual activity with HIV and may be used to treat both diseases. However, care must be taken when using HBV nucleos(t)ides that have not been fully studied in the HIV-infected population because the emergence of strains resistant to HIV treatment has been reported. Careful monitoring of response to treatment is needed when treating an HIV/HBV patient with severe immune suppression. Improved ability to obtain long-term HBV DNA suppression and avoid resistance will translate into improved survival in this population."
1935,0.001,1.0000,"We describe a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient with chronic active hepatitis B. The patient presented with acute clinical hepatitis during highly active antiretroviral therapy concomitant with immunovirological improvement of HIV infection. The hepatitis resolved within a few weeks despite the pursuit of antiretroviral drugs. Hepatitis B tests, which remained unchanged after two cycles of interferon alfa therapy and continuous administration of lamivudine, were improved with the clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) early antigen (HBeAg), the detection of antibody to HBV early antigen (HBeAb) and the undetectability of serum HBV DNA. Several months after this episode, HBV and HIV tests are still controlled."
2954,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection treated with alpha interferon and subsequent loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) eliminate HDV. HDV RNA was detected in 26 of 28 patients with chronic delta hepatitis using the polymerase chain reaction. Seventeen patients in whom HDV RNA was detected were treated with alpha interferon; in 65%, HDV RNA remained detectable during treatment or reappeared after stopping therapy whereas in three patients HDV RNA remained absent (17.5%). HDV RNA became and remained undetectable in serum and liver of two of these three patients who lost HBsAg from serum and in one patient who was intermittently HBsAg negative during therapy. After loss of HBsAg, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was still detectable in the liver, but not HBV RNA, indicating absent or very low HBV replication. Three patients were lost to follow up (17.5%). Two nontreated patients with chronic HDV infection also lost HBsAg during follow up; HDV RNA also became undetectable in their serum. Thus, HDV replication does not persist after the loss of HBsAg. Clearance of HBsAg may be a useful guide to when therapy can be stopped."
1706,0.001,1.0000,"We have characterized the hepatitis B virus state in liver and serum of 38 HBsAg-positive chronic hepatitis patients (chronic active hepatitis (CAH), 19; chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH), 7; cirrhosis, 11; 'normal' carrier, 1) and 21 HBsAg-negative patients. Episomal HBV-DNA in liver, without detectable integrated HBV-DNA sequences, concomitant with HBV-DNA in serum was found in 19 HBeAg-positive patients (CAH, 16; CPH, 1; cirrhosis, 2). Integrated sequences were detected in 13 HBsAg-positive HBeAg-negative patients (CAH, 1; CPH, 5; cirrhosis, 7) and in 1 HBsAg-negative patient. Episomal HBV-DNA and integrated HBV-DNA sequences were observed simultaneously in 1 HBsAg-positive HBeAg-negative CPH patient and in 4 HBsAg-positive cirrhosis patients (2 HBeAg-positive, 2 HBeAg-negative). The presence of HBcAg immunofluorescence corresponded well with that of episomal HBV-DNA. Antiviral therapy is advised for HBsAg-positive chronic hepatitis patients with episomal HBV-DNA, irrespective of the presence of integrated sequences. Since the presence of episomal HBV-DNA in liver is not always accompanied by the presence of serum HBV-DNA, procedures for the selection and evaluation of patients for antiviral therapy should be extended by characterization of the HBV-DNA state in liver biopsies."
1845,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was once thought to be a relative or even absolute contraindication to transplantation. With the recent advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), those infected with HIV are now living longer and dying from illnesses other than acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although studies prior to the HAART era suggested poor outcomes might occur with transplantation in those infected with HIV, more recent studies have demonstrated results comparable to those of recipients without HIV infection. A number of issues persist regarding ethics, patient selection, post-operative management, and drug interactions between antiretroviral and immunosuppression agents. In this review, kidney, liver, and heart transplantation in the HIV-positive population were analyzed using data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/ Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients."
8854,0.001,1.0000,"Although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been a major global health problem for almost 3 decades, with the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996 and effective prophylaxis and management of opportunistic infections, mortality from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has decreased markedly. In developed countries, this condition is now being treated as a chronic condition. As a result, rates of morbidity and mortality from other medical conditions leading to end-stage liver, kidney, and heart disease are steadily increasing in individuals with HIV. Because the definitive treatment for end-stage organ failure is transplantation, the demand for it has increased among HIV-infected patients. For these reasons, many transplant centers have eliminated HIV infection as a contraindication to transplantation, as a result of better patient management and demand."
4193,0.001,1.0000,"The most common first-line, highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) received by individuals infected with HIV-1 in Cameroon is the combination therapy Triomune, comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI). To examine the efficacy of these drugs in Cameroon, where diverse non-B HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses predominate, the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral sequences in patient plasma were analyzed for the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance. Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon."
741,0.001,1.0000,"Despite disproportionate rates of HIV among transgender women and evidence that medication adherence is necessary for treatment success and increased likelihood of survival, there has been little investigation into antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence issues among transgender women. This study examined rates of self-reported ART adherence among transgender women on ART (n = 35) and well-established correlates of nonadherence, including depression, adherence self-efficacy, patient perceptions of interactions with their providers, and perceived adverse side effects of ART compared to other respondents (n = 2,770). Transgender women on ART were less likely to report 90% adherence rates or higher and reported less confidence in their abilities to integrate treatment regimens into their daily lives. When transgender women were compared to other respondents, regardless of the current medication regimen, they reported significantly fewer positive interactions with their health care providers. Training for providers and integration of hormone therapy into HIV care is recommended."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of these intestinal protozoa in HIV-positive patients in the Triângulo Mineiro region of Brazil and to correlate the presence of these infections with clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data of the patients. Oocysts were detected in stool samples of 10 (16.9%) of the 59 patients studied, while Cryptosporidium spp. were present in 10.1% (6/59) and C. belli in 6.7% (4/59). The frequency of these parasites was higher among patients with diarrheic syndrome and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts < 200 cells/mm 3 , demonstrating the opportunistic characteristic of these infections. A significant association was observed between the lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy and the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and/or C. belli. Parasitism with Cryptosporidium spp. was more frequent in February and April, the months following the period of high rainfall. The same was not observed for C. belli. Genetic characterization of two isolates led to the identification of Cryptosporidium parvum, one of the main species associated with the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis."

The main presenting complaints were chronic cough and persistent diarrhoea and vomiting. These children frequently had diarrhoea (8 of 9 patients), mucocutaneous candidiasis (8), pneumonia (7), hepatosplenomegaly (9), significant lymphadenopathy (5) and wasting (5). All were infected by common bacteria, such as Gram-negative organisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Campylobacter jejuni, or by opportunistic infections such as Candida or cytomegalovirus (CMV), or by both bacterial and opportunistic organisms. A raised total serum globulin level, anaemia, lymphopenia and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis were frequent findings. Incomplete data on parental HIV status suggest perinatal transmission. Three of the children were HIV-antigen positive. The diagnosis of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), using the stringent Centers for Disease Control criteria, is difficult in our situation because of limited diagnostic resources; however, using these criteria, and the clinical case definition for AIDS recommended by World Health Organisation, it is thought that probably 4 of these children could be considered as having AIDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
4974,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is endemic in Asian communities in the United States. The purpose of the current study was to compare the antiviral efficacy of interferon-alpha2b in a group of adult Asian patients chronically infected with hepatitis B with active replication compared to a control group of Caucasian patients treated with the same regimen. Patients with entry aminotransferase (ALT) levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal received interferon-alpha2b, 5 million units, subcutaneously daily for 16 weeks. Patients with pretreatment ALT levels 1.5-3 times the upper limit of normal received prednisone for a total of six weeks prior to interferon starting at 60 mg daily with reduction in dosage by 20 mg every two weeks with a two-week period between finishing prednisone and starting interferon-alpha2b. Eight (62%) of the 13 Asians and six (60%) of the 10 Caucasians cleared HBeAg and HBV DNA from serum (NS). By the end of one year of follow-up after therapy, four (67%) of six Caucasian responders but none of the Asian responders had cleared hepatitis B surface antigen from serum (P < 0.05). Loss of serum markers of active replication appeared less durable in the Asian responders compared to the Caucasians with reappearance of serum HBeAg in two (25%) of eight of the former but only one (17%) of the latter group. Three other Asian patients subsequently redeveloped HBeAg in serum. It is concluded that adult Asian-Americans have an identical initial response rate to antiviral therapy with interferon-alpha2b; however, the response may be less durable and does not usually lead to loss of HBsAg."
4253,0.001,1.0000,"Neurodevelopmental delay has been documented in up to 97.5% of HIV-infected children in Soweto who were not yet on antiretroviral treatment (ART). With growing numbers of children in South Africa being successfully treated with ART, the effects of ART on neurocognitive functioning in children require investigation. The objective of this study was to determine the extent of neurodevelopmental delay in stable HIV-infected preschool children (aged five to six years) receiving ART and compare it to an apparently healthy (unconfirmed HIV-status) group of preschool children. Thirty HIV-infected preschool children (virologically and immunologically stable on ART for more than one year) were conveniently sampled from 350 eligible children on ART at the Harriet Shezi Children's Clinic in Soweto, Johannesburg. The comparison group comprised 30 well-nourished preschool children attending the Lilian Ngoyi Primary Health Care Clinic in Soweto for routine immunizations. Each child was assessed using the Griffiths Mental Development Scales-Extended Revised Version (GMDS-ER), at a single point in time. The overall developmental z-scores on GMDS-ER were <-2 (indicating severe delay) in 27 (90%) children in the HIV-infected group compared to 23 (76%) in the comparison group (p = 0.166). Mental handicap (overall GQ < 70) was evident in 46.7% of children in the HIV-infected group compared to 10% in the comparison group (p = 0.002). There was a 7.88-fold increased likelihood of severe delay in the HIV infected group. The HIV-infected group and comparison group had significantly different (p = 0.001) mean overall GQ scores of 70 (95% CI: 66.0-74.0) and 78 (95% CI: 75.6-80.5), respectively, with lower mean scores in the HIV-infected group in all individual domains. Early initiation of ART in HIV-infected infants may improve cognitive functioning among this group; however, intervention strategies which optimize early cognitive development for all children in the area need to be urgently considered."
8241,0.001,1.0000,"Dysfunction of T follicular-helper (TFH) cells is a possible cause of impaired germinal centre (GC) and IgG antibody responses in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection and might contribute to decreased magnitude and isotype diversification of IgG antibodies to pneumococcal polysaccharides (PcPs). We examined the production of IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies to PcPs 4, 6B, 9V and 14 by enumerating antibody secreting cells (ASCs) at day (D) 7 and determining fold-increase in serum antibody levels at D28 after vaccination with unconjugated PcPs in HIV seronegative subjects (n = 20) and in HIV patients who were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) (n = 28) or who were ART-naive (n = 11) and determined their association with ICOS+ and ICOS- circulating memory TFH (cmTFH) cells (CD4+CD45RA-CD27+CXCR5+PD-1+) and short lived plasmablasts (SPBs) at D7, and with PcP-specific and total IgM+ and IgG+ memory B cells at D0. In HIV seronegative subjects, production of IgG1+ and IgG2+ ASCs was consistently associated with the frequency of ICOS+ cmTFH cells but not ICOS- cmTFH cells or memory B cells. In contrast, post-vaccination ASCs in HIV patients, regardless of ART status, were lower than in HIV seronegative subjects and not associated with ICOS+ cmTFH cells, the expansion of which was absent (ART-naive patients) or much lower than in HIV seronegative subjects (ART-treated patients). Production of SPBs was also lower in ART-naive patients. Fold-increase in IgG2 antibodies at D28 also correlated with ICOS+ cmTFH cells at D7 in HIV seronegative subjects but not in HIV patients. These novel findings provide evidence that ICOS+ cmTFH cells contribute to the regulation of PcP-specific IgG antibody responses, including isotype diversification, and that TFH cell dysfunction may be a cause of impaired PcP-specific IgG antibody responses and increased susceptibility to pneumococcal disease in HIV patients."

For each HAT patient, 3 controls, matched for sex, age and residence, were selected. Data relating to socio-demographic factors and potential risk factors for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and HIV infections were obtained, and serum samples were collected for HIV-1 and HIV-2 tests. A positive test consisted of enzyme immunoassay reactive to HIV-1, HIV-2 or both and confirmed by a synthetic peptide test or Western blot. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression with EGRET software. No statistically significant difference was found between the prevalence of HIV infection in HAT patients and controls (4.3% and 3.5% respectively; crude odds ratio (OR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-2.50). In multivariate analysis, allowance for 5 covariates did not change the association between the 2 infections (adjusted OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.64-2.52). Although this study had limited statistical power, no significant association was found between HIV infection and T.b. gambiense infection in rural Côte d'Ivoire.

2048,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections is a worldwide issue that can lead to both acute and chronic complications with increased morbidity and mortality in affected individuals. Current methods of preventing HBV infections primarily include building patient immunity through administration of hepatitis B vaccinations starting at birth. Certain at-risk individuals, including those with occupational exposure to pathogenic bodily fluids, those who are sexually active or intravenous drug users, are recommended to receive some form of hepatitis B vaccination. The current standard of hepatitis B vaccination in the United States is the Engerix-B vaccine, which consists of a three-dose regimen over a 6-month time period. A new hepatitis B vaccine, Heplisav-B, has been approved for adults in the United States and requires only two doses over 1 month. The unique dosing schedule of Heplisav-B provides the potential for increasing patient compliance and therefore can aid in the effort toward protecting individuals from developing an HBV infection. Results from clinical trials showed that Heplisav-B compared favorably with Engerix-B in safety and efficacy profiles. This paper provides a review of the pharmacology, safety, clinical trials and indications for use for the Heplisav-B vaccine in the United States."
6247,0.001,1.0000,"The need for antiretroviral therapy coupled with treatment of chronic co-morbidities places HIV-infected patients at risk for polypharmacy. However, few studies have described overall pill burden among HIV-infected patients. HIV-infected outpatients of the UNC Infectious Diseases Clinic were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Subjects were contacted prior to a scheduled appointment and asked to bring all their medications to the visit. Daily total pill burden and medication type were recorded. 151 subjects were recruited: 76% male, 58% African American, 97% receiving antiretrovirals (ARVs). Median age was 48 (IRQ: 42-54) years. The median number of medications per subject was 8 (IQR: 6-11), and the median individual daily pill burden was 8 pills (IQR: 5-15): 3 pills (range: 2-5) for ARVs and 6 (range: 3-12.5) pills for non-ARVs. Duration of ART (per 2 years increase) and more than 3 co-morbidities was significantly associated with high pill burden (over 10 pills per day) with adjusted OR of 2.09 (95% CI, 1.14-3.84) and 8.04 (95% CI, 2.30-28.15), respectively. As patients with HIV age, strategies to reduce pill burden and number of medications will become increasingly critical to maintaining adherence, preventing medication errors, and serious drug-drug interactions."
2732,0.001,1.0000,"In order to assess the adequacy of learning about the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in vocational training for general practice, a postal questionnaire survey was carried out among trainers and their trainees in seven health regions of England and Scotland. A total of 616 trainers (62%) and 538 trainees (58%) responded to the questionnaire asking about their knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding HIV and AIDS. Trainees' principal difficulties with HIV and AIDS resembled those of general practitioners currently in practice. More than 60% of trainees lacked knowledge about HIV and AIDS in babies, 50% would not accept intravenous drug misusers onto their list, only 12% found it easy to discuss sex with homosexual male patients, and only 37% felt able to offer counselling about HIV and AIDS. Trainees who had had a tutorial on HIV and AIDS as part of vocational training were significantly more knowledgeable than the remainder (P less than 0.01). In addition, trainees who found workshops on HIV and AIDS useful were more willing than others to take on drug misusers (P less than 0.05) and more confident in their ability to counsel patients with HIV infection (P less than 0.01). No significant associations were found between the trainers' own knowledge, attitudes and skills regarding HIV and AIDS and those of their trainees. It is concluded that there is a need to improve teaching about HIV and AIDS in vocational training for general practice. All general practitioner trainees should receive a tutorial to update their knowledge about HIV and AIDS, and attend a suitable workshop to challenge unfavourable attitudes and improve confidence in counselling."

This study was carried out to document the commonly reported adverse reactions caused by ARV drugs in HIV patients in Tanzania. Information on drug induced adverse reactions (ADRs) in patients using ARV drugs was collected from the databases maintained in HIV clinics of Dar es Salaam and Mbeya. A total of 7502 and 1234 records of patients under ARV therapy by December 2006 were analysed in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya, respectively. In May, 2008 a cross-sectional study was conducted in which, the association between nevirapine (NVP) plasma concentrations and skin rashes problems was determined in 50 patients put on NVP based HAART for less than 2 weeks. Determination of NVP plasma concentration was carried out using a validated HPLC method in which patients from Dar es Salaam were involved. The study revealed that, anaemia, liver toxicity, skin rash and peripheral neuropathy were the most reported ADRs. The NVP plasma level determination revealed that there was no difference between those who had experienced skin rashes and those who did not (mean of 6.05 and 5.5 microg/ml respectively). There was a slight increase in reported ADRs between 2005 and 2006. A total of 932 (12.4%) patients changed their regimen in Dar es Salaam between January 2005 and December, 2006. Similarly, a total of 542 (44%) patients in Mbeya changed their regimen during that period. It can be concluded that, in both Dar es Salaam and Mbeya patients developed ARV related ADRs which are similar to those reported elsewhere."
5870,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains an important global burden with an estimated 240 million HBV carriers worldwide and more than half a million people dying annually from the consequences of the HBV infection. Besides interferon and pegylated interferon, there are five antiviral drugs [lamivudine, adefovir (dipivoxil), entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate] that have proved effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. These five antiviral drugs interfere with viral DNA synthesis, which consists of a step reminiscent of the reverse transcriptase step in the replicative cycle of HIV. None of the antiviral drugs, or interferon, are capable of eradicating the covalently closed circular DNA, which remains settled as an episome within the virus-infected hepatocytes. In the short-term (1-3 years), the use of antiviral treatment is aimed at reducing viral DNA below levels of detection, whereas in the long term (10 years and, possibly, lifelong), treatment is aimed at reducing the progression to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver decompensation, and death. As long as the virus can hide as the episomal covalently closed circular DNA, attempts to envisage a definite cure of the HBV infection may seem fortuitous."

Endemic regions have been described in some Asian countries, whereas in Europe only sporadic cases have been reported. The prevalence of HEV and a series of other viral hepatitis infections was investigated in a group of 1,025 individuals immigrating into Germany from the former Soviet Union. Serum samples were tested for anti-HEV by a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) based on recombinant proteins, and by peptide EIA and immunoblot. Risk factors and other demographic information were investigated using a questionnaire and a short interview. The overall prevalence of anti-hepatitis E antibodies (anti-HEV) was 2.05%. The following risk factors for HEV infection were identified: age of > 65 years, resident in the south-west part of the former Soviet Union, history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and employment in health care professions. HEV prevalence is not strikingly different from that observed in Western European countries. However, the different rates found for HEV vs. hepatitis A virus (HAV) are intriguing, since similar routes of transmission (fecal-oral) are well documented for both viruses. Exposure to HBV is surprisingly high, and the number of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive individuals was also higher than those reported from Western European areas."

When the number of patients with HCV genotype 1b compared with that of patients with genotype 2a/2c, HBV DNA titer was not significantly different by independent t-test (t = -0.881, P = 0.392 > 0.05) between the two patient groups. These results suggest that the prevalence of HBV and HCV infection among intravenous drug users is high showing over 50% in Korea and a strategic prevention program should be performed in this group to prevent further infection into local community."
4712,0.001,1.0000,"A number of factors, including increased iron stores and alcohol consumption, are known to be associated with the development of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) in susceptible individuals. Recent reports have described a significant association between inheritance of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene, associated with genetic hemochromatosis (GH) and PCT. A strong association between hepatitis C virus infection and PCT has also been demonstrated, while case reports record a link between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and PCT. We have investigated the frequency of these factors in a racially-mixed population of patients with PCT in Cape Town, South Africa. 57 patients with PCT drawn from three ethnic groups were screened for the presence of the C282Y and H63D mutations linked to GH, and the prevalences were compared with corresponding healthy control populations. The seroprevalence of markers for HCV, hepatitis B (HBV) and HIV infection were examined in 28 of these. In the control populations, we found that both the C282Y and H63D mutations are highly prevalent in South Africans of European origin. In a population of mixed or Asian origin, the C282Y mutation is very rare whereas the H63D mutation is common. Neither mutation was encountered in any African subject. Both mutations are associated with PCT, but the association is dependent on the ethnic origins of the population to which the patient belongs. In contrast to other studies, HCV infection is numerically unimportant in PCT in our patients. HIV infection is increasingly encountered in our patients with PCT, but the strength of the association cannot be determined in view of the high background prevalence of HIV infection in some sectors of the South African population. The contribution of specific risk factors may be heavily dependent on the population from which patients are drawn, and care should be taken in extrapolating from observations in one racial or geographic population to any other."
2117,0.001,1.0000,"We investigated the influence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes on the clinical course of HCV infection in a haemodialysis population. In June 1991, a 4 year prospective follow-up programme was implemented in 184 consecutive haemodialysis patients. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma glutamine transferase (GGT) were performed every 2 months. When HCV antibody (Ab) (by second-generation ELISA) was positive, it was confirmed by RIBA 2 and HCV RNA amplification by PCR. The pattern of nucleotide sequence variability in the 5' non-coding region was categorized according to Simmonds' genotype classification. Risk factors including blood transfusions were evaluated. The levels of hepatic enzymes in HCV Ab-positive patients were retrospectively studied over a mean period of 11.8 years. ALT and GGT levels were assigned a score for every year of infection (0 = normal, 1 = fluctuating 2 = high levels). Fifty-two patients were HCV Ab reactive (30.4%), eight were RIBA undetermined and 44 were RIBA positive; 40 of these were HCV RNA positive (91%). Twelve patients were HCV RNA negative, suggesting that they had recovered from the infection. Four genotypes were identified: 1b [26 patients (65%)], 1a (one patient), 2 [12 patients (30%)] and 3 (one patient). The genotype distribution was not different from that found in patients with chronic hepatitis C and normal renal function of the same geographical area. Genotype 1b accounted for 75% of the cases before 1985 and an equal prevalence of the two major genotypes was observed after 1985. Patients infected with HCV subtype 1 had normal mean ALT levels, but higher levels in the follow-up period (28 +/- 15.6 IU/l) and higher ALT and GGT personal scores in the retrospective study. Genotype 1 patients had higher mean ALT levels after 6 months. HCV RNA-negative patients had lower ALT levels after 24 months. RIBA pattern could differentiate the patients. Patients with genotype 1 received a higher number of transfusions, while only 50% of HCV RNA-negative patients had been transfused. Our data suggest a worse course of HCV infection in haemodialysis patients infected with HCV subtype 1, but the severity of HCV infection can only be assessed by histology. Transaminases are only loosely correlated with severity."

To determine the HCC-associated mutations of the HBV genome in the entire X, core promoter, and precore/core regions, a cross-sectional control study was conducted comparing 80 Japanese patients infected with HBV C2 and suffering from HCC with 80 age-, sex-, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status-matched patients without HCC (non-HCC group). Each HBeAg-positive group (31 with HCC; 29 without HCC) and HBeAg-negative group (49 with HCC; 51 without HCC) was also matched with respect to age and sex. The C1479, T1485, H1499, A1613, T1653, V1753, T1762/A1764, and A1896 mutations were frequent in this population. The prevalences of the T1653 mutation in the box alpha region and the V1753 and T1762/A1764 mutations in the basal core promoter region were significantly higher in the HCC group than in the non-HCC group (56% versus 30%, 50% versus 24%, and 91% versus 73% [P = 0.0013, P = 0.0010, and P = 0.0035, respectively]). The platelet count was significantly lower for the HCC group than for the non-HCC group (10.7 x 10(4) +/- 5.1 x 10(4) versus 17.3 x 10(4) +/- 5.1 x 10(4) platelets/mm(3) [P < 0.0001]). Regardless of HBeAg status, the prevalence of the T1653 mutation was higher in the HCC group (52% versus 24% [P = 0.036] for HBeAg-positive patients and 59% versus 33% [P = 0.029] for HBeAg-negative patients). In the multivariate analysis, the presence of T1653, the presence of V1753, and a platelet count of < or =10 x 10(4)/mm(3) were independent predictive factors for HCC (odds ratios [95% confidence intervals], 4.37 [1.53 to 12.48], 7.98 [2.54 to 25.10], and 24.39 [8.11 to 73.33], respectively). Regardless of HBeAg status, the T1653 mutation increases the risk of HCC in Japanese patients with HBV/C2."

Surveillance databases including persons reported to the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene with HIV, HBV, and HCV by 31 December 2010 and not known to be dead as of 1 January 2000, were matched with 2000-2011 vital statistics mortality data. Of 140 606 persons reported with HIV, 4% were co-infected with HBV only, 15% were co-infected with HCV only, and 1% were co-infected with HBV and HCV. In all groups, 70-80% were male. The most common race/ethnicity and HIV transmission risk groups were non-Hispanic blacks and men who have sex with men (MSM) for HIV/HBV infection, and non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and injection drug users for HIV/HCV and HIV/HBV/HCV infections. The overall age-adjusted 2000-2011 mortality was higher in co-infected than HIV mono-infected individuals. Use of population-based surveillance data provided a comprehensive characterization of HIV co-infection with HBV and HCV. Our findings emphasize the importance of targeting HIV and viral hepatitis testing and prevention efforts to populations at risk for co-infection, and of integrating HIV and viral hepatitis care and testing services."
2417,0.001,1.0000,"We conducted a community-based study of the prevalence and correlates of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and immunization among young adults in a ""drug supermarket"" neighborhood in New York City. Four hundred eighty-nine young adults ages 18-24 years were recruited from Bushwick, Brooklyn through multistage household probability sampling (n = 332) and targeted sampling (n = 157), interviewed, and tested for three hepatitis B markers (HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs). Serological evidence of HBV infection was found in 8.0% (6.0% in the household sample and 12.1% in the targeted sample) and of hepatitis B immunization in 19.6% (22.6% in the household sample and 13.4% in the targeted sample). HBV infection was higher among young adults who either used crack or injected drugs and among those who traded sex for money or drugs. Having Medicaid was significantly associated with lower odds of infection in the household sample and higher odds of immunization in the targeted sample. Although adolescent hepatitis B immunization has been a public health priority in the United States since 1995, nearly three-quarters of young adults in this community did not have serological evidence of being either exposed or immunized. Whereas subsequent younger generations benefited from universal childhood hepatitis B immunization, this particular cohort of young adults who live in communities like Bushwick presents a unique group for prevention intervention."
3601,0.001,1.0000,"From the trends of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics in South and Southeast Asia, it was postulated that an HIV epidemic would start as a blood-borne infection among injecting-drug users in the Philippines. In 2002, 560 individuals were recruited in Metro Cebu, Philippines and tested for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. The seroprevalence of anti-HCV among injecting-drug users (70.1%, 61/87) was significantly higher than those among inhalation drug users (16.3%, 7/43; P = 0.00; OR = 12), sex workers (0%, 0/130; P = 0.00; OR = infinity), antenatal clinic attendees (0%, 0/100; P = 0.00; OR = infinity), and students/health care workers (2%, 4/200; P = 0.00; OR = 115). The seroprevalence of HBsAg among injecting-drug users (10.3%, 9/87) was significantly higher than those among sex workers (2.3%, 3/130; P = 0.01; OR = 4.9), and antenatal clinic attendees (3%, 3/100; P = 0.04; OR = 3.7), but was not statistically different from those among inhalation drug users (9.3%, 4/43; P = 0.9) and students/health care workers (4.5%, 9/200; P = 0.06). None of the study population was reactive to anti-HIV antibody. The HCV strains obtained from the injecting-drug users belonged to either genotype 1a or 2b and the strains in each genotype clustered closely to each other. There was no dual infection with genotype 1a and 2b. These results suggest that the HCV infection in injecting-drug users may be emanating rapidly from limited number individuals in Metro Cebu, Philippines."
164,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI) among patients at the time of and subsequent to the diagnosis of HIV, and possible immunological or virological features of patients with STI. An observational study was carried out on the results of annual STI screenings conducted on consecutive HIV-infected men in the Department of Genitourinary Medicine, Edinburgh between 1 January 1999 and 1 January 2003. Patients were tested for syphilis, gonococcal, and chlamydial infections. Among the 79 male patients in the study cohort, the frequencies of all STI rose within the study period. The three-year positivity rates of episodes of gonorrhoea, chlamydia, and syphilis were (42/131) 32%, (21/127) 16%, and (13/150) 9%, respectively. Patients with STI had significantly higher median CD4+ T-cells (P<0.02) and lower median viral loads (P<0.0001), and a higher proportion of them were on highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) (P<0.0002) compared with those without an STI. Routine screening for STI and counselling for safe sex should be part of care for all HIV-infected patients."
9284,0.001,1.0000,"Correction of the virus-induced deficits in innate immunity of HIV-infected subjects could well contribute to enhanced immune recovery and efficacious control of viral replication. The safe synthetic immunomodulator Murabutide (ISTAC Biotechnology, Lille, France) has been found to regulate the function of antigen-presenting cells and to selectively activate CD4 lymphocytes leading to dramatic suppression of HIV replication, in vitro. Therefore, as a first step toward the evaluation of the immunotherapeutic potential of Murabutide in HIV disease, we have conducted two phase 1/2 clinical trials to address the safety and the immunologic effects of Murabutide administration into HIV-infected subjects receiving antiretroviral therapy. The first study revealed that single administration of 5, 7, or 9 mg of Murabutide, to 6 patients per dose, was well tolerated. This was accompanied by a selective induction of cytokines and chemokines detectable in the serum, and the levels appeared to plateau at the 7-mg dose. The second study then evaluated the safety and biological effects of repeated administrations of 7 mg Murabutide, on 5 consecutive days, in 12 HIV-1-infected patients. A good clinical tolerance was noted throughout the study. Moreover, changes in several immune parameters, including downregulation of coreceptor expression on lymphocytes and improved lymphoproliferative responses, were detected during or/and up to 3 weeks after Murabutide administration. These encouraging results warrant further evaluation of longer periods or cycles of immunotherapy with Murabutide in HIV-infected subjects."
3214,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence of occult hepatitis B, defined by absence of HBsAg and HBV DNA, ranges widely in patients with hepatitis C. This may influence the treatment of hepatitis C and the severity of liver disease. Sensitive and specific real-time PCR techniques are available commercially and can detect more reliably low HBV DNA levels. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection using the COBAS Taqman assay (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) in the serum and liver of HBsAg negative patients with chronic hepatitis C and to evaluate its clinical consequences on liver pathology and its impact on the response to treatment with peg-IFNalpha and Ribavirin. HBV DNA detection was assessed retrospectively on 140 sera and 113 liver biopsies of HCV positive/HBsAg negative patients before treatment. A 4.4% (5/113) prevalence of occult hepatitis B was recorded in liver samples and in none of the sera. Anti-HBc was not detected in one, three of whom were sustained virological responders to treatment, one was relapsed responder and one was non-responder. Furthermore, in this cohort composed of 12% anti-HBs negative/anti-HBc positive and 20% anti-HBs positive/anti-HBc positive patients, anti-HBc was not associated with pre-therapeutic viral load, ALT serum levels, and histological activity or fibrosis. Using a commercial real-time PCR assay, we observed a low prevalence of occult B hepatitis. This, just as anti-HBC status, had no clinical impact in a large cohort of hepatitis C patients. It therefore does not appear useful to screen for occult hepatitis B in these patients with this test before beginning HCV treatment."
7387,0.001,1.0000,"Oral manifestations in HIV infections are numerous and some of these are acknowledged as being of great importance in the early diagnosis of the disease. Many HIV-associated oral infections occur early in HIV disease, not infrequently as the presenting sign or symptom. Thus, early detection of the associated oral opportunistic infections should, in many cases, result in earlier diagnosis of HIV infection. Cytology, a simple, painless, and inexpensive method, has become a preferred method and was used in our study for early diagnosis of certain lesions. To determine the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy on incidence rate of opportunistic infections among HIV-positive adults in a teaching hospital in India, a prospective study was conducted and the required sample size was 40. Study participants were selected randomly from the outpatient department of an HIV clinic who were currently on for antiretroviral therapy (ART). Data on age, gender, form of contagion, antiretroviral therapy at the time of review, number of CD4 lymphocytes per milliliter, and viral load were collected. Oral cytologic investigation was carried out and then stained for histopathological examination. A total of 40 individuals were examined and the incidence of opportunistic infections was 66.7% in individuals with CD4 counts less than 200, 55.6% in individuals with CD4 counts of 200 to 499, and 40.0% in individuals with CD4 counts more than 500. The incidence of opportunistic infection was higher in individuals with low CD4 counts in spite of being on ART."
8379,0.001,1.0000,"In contrast to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected humans, natural hosts for simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) very rarely progress to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). While the mechanisms underlying this disease resistance are still poorly understood, a consistent feature of natural SIV infection is the absence of the generalized immune activation associated with HIV infection. To investigate the immunologic mechanisms underlying the absence of AIDS in SIV-infected sooty mangabeys (SMs), a natural host species, we performed a detailed analysis of the SIV-specific cellular immune responses in 110 SIV-infected SMs. We found that while SIV-specific T-cell responses are detectable in the majority of animals, their magnitude and breadth are, in fact, lower than what has been described in HIV-infected humans, both in terms of cytokine production (ie, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2) and degranulation (ie, CD107a expression). Of importance, SIV-specific T-cell responses were similarly low when either SIVmac239-derived peptides or autologous SIVsmm peptides were used as stimuli. No correlation was found between SIV-specific T-cell responses and either viral load or CD4+ T-cell count, or between these responses and markers of T-cell activation and proliferation. These findings indicate that the absence of AIDS in naturally SIV-infected sooty mangabeys is independent of a strong cellular immune response to the virus."

Using baseline data and controlling for gender, race, age, and education, we examined associations between self-reported two- and Seven-day adherence and access to healthcare, mental health, substance use, and attitudes toward HIV medical therapy. Of the 644 participants, 358 (55%) were currently on HAART. For two-day adherence, 280 (78%) reported missing no prescribed doses (100% adherence), and for seven-day adherence, 291 (81%) reported > or =90% adherence. Logistic regression analyses indicated being younger, not having health insurance, and drug use were associated with missing > or =1 dose over the past two days. Scoring lower on SF-36 mental component summary scale and having greater risk of depression (CES-D) and stress (Perceived Stress Scale) were associated with poorer adherence for both two- and seven-day outcomes. Negative attitudes toward HIV treatment were also associated with lower adherence. Adherence to HIV medications in this population is similar to other groups. Coexisting problems of access to healthcare, higher risk of mental health problems, along with poorer attitudes toward treatment are associated with increased likelihood of missing doses. Comprehensive models of HIV care that include a continuum of medical and social services are essential for treating this population."

A total of 1446 hospitals, clinics, and other health-care institutions throughout Japan were enrolled in the study, which was supported by the Japanese government Ministry of Health and Welfare with a health sciences grant for research on HIV/AIDS. Of the 1434 registered patients who had been infected with HIV-1 by contaminated blood coagulation factor products, 493 (34%) had died as of Oct. 30, 1997. Most were hemophiliacs. The average CD4+ cell count was 25/microliter for the 398 who died of complications from AIDS, compared to an average of 158/microliter for those who died of other causes. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, cytomegalovirus infection, and atypical mycobacterial disease were the main causes of death in patients with AIDS. The annual death rate for AIDS patients in Japan dropped dramatically in 1997, 1 year later than a similar trend observed in the United States.

To evaluate the prevalence of GBV-C/HGV infection among Egyptians, five groups were enrolled in this study: group I, healthy blood donors (82); group II, health care personnel (30); group III, chronic non-B non-C hepatitis patients (63); group IV, chronic hepatitis C patients (100); group V, renal dialysis patients (79). GBV-C/HGV-RNA was detected by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers derived from 5'-non coding region of GBV-C/HGV. GBV-C/HGV-RNA was detected in 57 of 354 tested sera with an overall prevalence of 16.1%. Meanwhile, isolated GBV-C/HGV infection was detected in 16/57 (28.1%), GBV-C/HGV coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 37/57 (64.9%) and with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 4/57 (7.6%) of cases. The highest prevalence was encountered among dialysis patients reaching 30% followed by chronic hepatitis C (14%), blood donors (12.2%), chronic non-B non-C hepatitis (11.1%), whereas the lowest prevalence rate of 6.6% was detected among health care personnel. Nucleotide sequence analysis in three Egyptians confirmed that these PCR products were derived from GBV-C/HGV genome and all isolates classified into US/European type (type 2) of GBV-C/HGV genotypes. The risk factors of all cases were non-transfusion parenteral exposure, e.g. reusing syringes, dental treatment, surgery, invasive medical maneuvers, with an exception of renal dialysis patients who have had repeated blood transfusion. It is concluded that there is a relatively high prevalence of GBV-C/HGV-RNA among different Egyptian groups compared to international figures. The main risk factors were direct percutaneous exposure rather than blood transfusion. The Egyptian GBV-C/HGV isolates are very similar to the American isolate PNF 2161."
2546,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a worldwide public health concern. The circulation of strains carrying mutations in the viral proteins implies both clinical and therapeutics challenges. HBV complete genomes (HBV-CGs) were reported from injecting drug users and HBV chronically infected patients from Argentina-including Amerindians-although no studies were conducted in blood donors. Here, we described HBV-CG sequences from the latter population. Some of the HBV sequences classified as B2 and C2 subgenotypes clustering together with Asian isolates, while others, such as D3, F1b, and F4, were homologous to European and Latin America sequences. New substitutions for all analyzed open reading frames and changes in the HBsAg hydrophobicity profiles were detected. Several HBV-CG subgenotypes are described for the first time in this population. Mutations observed in X, PreS, and P proteins have been associated with advanced liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or natural resistance to nucleos(t)ide antiviral treatment. It deserves to be highlighted that these substitutions were detected in a population without epidemiological risk factors for viral infection, and most importantly, without any previous antiviral treatment (natural resistance). Regarding the remaining mutations, further research is warranted in order to determine their clinical and therapeutics relevance."
9973,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection affects approximately 375 million people worldwide. Current antiviral treatment effectively controls, but rarely clears chronic HBV infection. In addition, a significant portion of chronic HBV infected patients are not suitable for currently available antiviral therapy, and still face higher risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The poorly understood pathogenesis of HBV infection is the main barrier for developing more effective treatment strategies. HBV has long been viewed as non-cytopathic and the central hypothesis for HBV pathogenesis lies in the belief that hepatitis B is a host specific immunity-mediated liver disease. However, this view has been challenged by the accumulating experimental and clinical data that support a model of cytopathic HBV replication. In this article we systematically review the pathogenic role of HBV replication in hepatitis B and suggest possible HBV replication related mechanisms for HBV-mediated liver injury. We propose that a full understanding of HBV pathogenesis should consider the following elements. I. Liver injury can be caused by high levels of HBV replication and accumulation of viral products in the infected hepatocytes. II. HBV infection can be either directly cytopathic, non-cytopathic, or a mix of both in an individual patient depending upon accumulation levels of viral products that are usually associated with HBV replication activity in individual infected hepatocytes."
9399,0.001,1.0000,"Algeria is the largest country of Africa, with a population of 40 million inhabitants living in disparate environments from the Sahara to the large cities of the Mediterranean coast. The molecular epidemiology of hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants has been partially described, but variations in the seroprevalence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) throughout the Algerian territories are still poorly described. We analyzed demographic features of new cases of chronic infection collected in 41 administrative regions (covering 92% of the population) in 2013. The mean age of the 1876 HBsAg(+) patients was 36.8 ± 14.2 years, with a slight excess of males (54%). The seroprevalence of HBV early antigen (HBeAg) was 9.3%, and the mean virus load was 3.2 ± 1.8 log IU/ml. A subset of 15.2% of patients was already cirrhotic at disease discovery. An important heterogeneity was observed throughout the country, with nine regions displaying a significant excess of cases. These regions formed four distinct foci located in distant parts of the country: Adrar-Bechar (southwest), El-Oued-Tebessa (east), M'Sila-Sétif (north central) and Oran-Aïn Temouchent (northwest). An excess of cases was found as well in the national capital Algiers. Patients from southern regions with an excess of cases (Bechar, Adrar, El Oued) were significantly younger (32.0 ± 10.7 years), as were patients from the regions of Bejaia and Bouira (32.1 ± 10.6). The southwestern regions were also marked by a significant imbalance of the sex ratio (58 vs 39% of female cases, P = 4.5 E-5).

2483,0.001,1.0000,"Thalassemia is a congenital hemolytic disease caused by defective globin synthesis treated by blood transfusion. Transfusion-transmitted infections still make a great challenge in the management of patients with thalassemia major. The most important worldwide transfusion-transmitted infections are hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV. The objective of this study is to update the prevalence of the three major transfusion-transmitted infections HCV, HBV and HIV among thalassemic patients followed up in the Hematology Department, Children Hospital, Cairo University. The study included 174 multitransfused thalassemic patients (162 major and 12 intermedia), registered at the Pediatric Hematology Clinic, Cairo University. Their age ranged from 2 to 27 years with a mean of 11.26 ± 5.4 years. Patients were subjected to full history taking, stressing on history of blood transfusions (onset, frequency and duration) at a single or multiple centers and abdominal examination. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count, aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase), ferritin and viral markers of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) and anti-HIV were assayed for all cases by a third-generation ELISA method. HCV PCR was performed for 75 cases. Of the 174 patients, none of them were HBsAg and anti-HIV positive. However, 90 patients were anti-HCV positive (51.7%). HCV PCR was positive in 56 patients (74.3%) of the 75 with positive antibody tested. HCV antibody positivity is statistically significant with age of the patient, serum ferritin and liver transaminases (P < 0.01). HCV-RNA by PCR positivity was significantly related to patients' age and serum ferritin (P < 0.05). Serum ferritin showed statistically significant positive correlation with liver transaminases. Despite the decrease in prevalence of HCV antibody in our patients from 71% in 1995 to 51.7% in our study, yet HCV infection still represents a major health problem for our thalassemic patients, which requires more attention and efforts to challenge. There is a dramatic decrease in the prevalence of HBV infection over the last decade, thanks to mass compulsory vaccination and blood screening. HIV infection does not represent a problem owing to very low population prevalence."
1319,0.001,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had spread unrecognized in the human population as sexually transmitted disease and was finally identified by its disease AIDS in 1981. Even after the isolation of the causative agent in 1983, the burden and death rate of AIDS accelerated worldwide especially in young people despite the confection of new drugs capable to inhibit virus replication since 1997. However, at least in industrialised countries, this trend could be reversed by the introduction of combination therapy strategies. The design of new drugs is on going; besides the inhibition of the three enzymes of HIV for replication and maturation (reverse transcriptase, integrase and protease), further drugs inhibits fusion of viral and cellular membranes and virus maturation. On the other hand, viral diagnostics had been considerably improved since the emergence of HIV. There was a need to identify infected people correctly, to follow up the course of immune reconstitution of patients by measuring viral load and CD4 cells, and to analyse drug escape mutations leading to drug resistance. Both the development of drugs and the refined diagnostics have been transferred to the treatment of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). This progress is not completed; there are beneficial aspects in the response of the scientific community to the HIV burden for the management of other viral diseases. These aspects are described in this contribution. Further aspects as handling a stigmatising disease, education of self-responsiveness within sexual relationships, and ways for confection of a protective vaccine are not covered."

Here, based on the evolutionary principle that the population frequency of lethal mutations equals the rate at which they are produced, we have estimated the mutation rate of HBV in vivo by scoring premature stop codons in 621 publicly available, full-length, molecular clone sequences derived from patients. This yielded an estimate of 8.7 × 10-5 spontaneous mutations per nucleotide per cell infection in untreated patients, which should be taken as an upper limit estimate because PCR errors and/or lack of effective lethality may inflate observed mutation frequencies. We found that, in patients undergoing lamivudine/adefovir treatment, the HBV mutation rate was elevated by more than sixfold, revealing a mutagenic effect of this treatment. Genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms indicated that lamivudine/adefovir treatment increases the fraction of A/T-to-G/C base substitutions, consistent with recent work showing similar effects of lamivudine in cellular DNA. Based on these data, the rate at which HBV produces new genetic variants in treated patients is similar to or even higher than in RNA viruses. "
3542,0.001,1.0000,"Although a vast majority of HIV-1-positive patients in the UK are infected with clade B virus, a large number of newly diagnosed cases of heterosexually transmitted HIV-1 are acquired abroad, in countries where non-B clade HIV-1 predominates. Since the development of the viral load assay in 1988, assessment of HIV-1 plasma viraemia has become an integral part of HIV clinical care; however, the contemporary viral load assay was developed and optimized for clade B HIV-1. Here we report the underquantification of viraemia in an individual infected with clade A virus, and the consequent initial classification of the patient as an HIV controller (HIC). Immunological investigations of interferon (IFN)-γ and lymphoproliferative responses to HIV-1 clade B antigens and peptides, in parallel with mitogenic stimulation, were performed. Subsequent comparison with responses observed within clade B-infected HIC led to viral sequencing, confirmation of infecting clade and recommendation of antiretroviral therapy initiation. We emphasize the growing need for awareness of possible limitations of the commonly used viral load assays, which cannot be relied upon unreservedly in a clinical setting. Furthermore, this case highlights the increasing need for more detailed investigation into both viral genetics and fitness when defining patients as HIC."
9357,0.001,1.0000,"High serum prolactin (PRL) levels and even hyperprolactinemia are a common finding in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms that may contribute to the rise of PRL. We measured serum PRL levels in 54 HIV-infected and 85 healthy age-matched men. The association between PRL levels among anti-PRL autoantibodies and other clinical variables in HIV-infected men was studied. We also evaluated the changes in serum PRL levels by chromatographic separation (affinity with protein G and gel filtration) after a 10-mg iv bolus of metoclopramide. HIV-infected men had higher serum PRL levels compared with healthy men. Sera from 9 of the 54 (16.7%)HIV-infected men were found to have hyperprolactinemia. Moreover, the anti-PRL autoantibody was present in four of nine (44.4%)HIV-infected men with hyperprolactinemia; it was also associated with hyperprolactinemic status. Serum total PRL levels were higher in HIV-infected men with anti-PRL autoantibodies than hyperprolactinemic HIV-infected men without anti-PRL autoantibodies; by contrast, free PRL levels were lower. In HIV-infected men with anti-PRL autoantibodies, gel filtration showed that big big PRL isoform was present as the predominant circulating form of PRL throughout each measurement after iv metoclopramide. By contrast, the predominant isoform of PRL in serum from healthy men and HIV-infected men who were anti-PRL autoantibody negative was little PRL. On the other hand, high serum total PRL levels were observed at each measurement throughout the metoclopramide test in HIV-infected men with anti-PRL autoantibodies; however, the serum free PRL levels were similar to those found in subjects without anti-PRL autoantibodies. These data demonstrated that anti-PRL autoantibodies are associated with hyperprolactinemic status in HIV-infected subjects, particularly in those with high serum PRL levels."
1680,0.001,1.0000,"We analyzed serum 25(OH) cholecalciferol [25(OH)D] levels and factors related to deficiency (<20 ng/ml) or insufficiency (<30 ng/ml) in a cohort of Spanish HIV-infected patients and compared them with an age- and latitude-matched population from another study. We prospectively assessed 25(OH)D deficiency/insufficiency in a cohort of 352 HIV patients during 2009-2010. Predisposing factors were recorded and their relationship to low levels was assessed by logistic regression; a nutritional survey examined intake, nutritional status, and sunlight exposure in a subgroup of 92 patients. We studied the correlation of 25(OH)D with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) was 44.0% (95% CI, 38.8-49.4%) and insufficiency (<30 ng/ml) was 71.6% (95% CI, 66.9-76.3). Deficiency was 16.4% more prevalent in our sample than in non-HIV-infected Spaniards. Lower sunlight exposure was the only factor related to lower levels in the lifestyle and nutritional survey (p=0.045). In multiple logistic regression, higher body mass index (BMI), black race/ethnicity, lower seasonal sunlight exposure, men who have sex with men (MSM), and heterosexual transmission categories, efavirenz exposure and lack of HIV viral suppression were independently associated with deficiency/insufficiency. These variables predicted 79% of cases [AUC=0.872 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91)]. Patients receiving protease inhibitors (PIs) [OR 4.0 (95% CI, 1.3-12.3); p=0.014] or NNRTI [OR 3.6 (95% CI, 1.7-11.2); p=0.025] had higher odds of increased PTH levels; this was significant only in 25(OH)D-deficient patients (p=0.004). As in less insolated areas, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was high in HIV-infected patients in Spain; among treated patients, levels were higher with PIs than with efavirenz."
2997,0.001,1.0000,"To characterize neurological and neuropsychological findings associated with human immunodeficiency virus type-I (HIV) infection, 77 seropositive homosexual or bisexual males with no or minor symptoms of HIV were compared prospectively to 44 HIV seronegative men by observers blinded to serological status of the subjects. Neurological symptoms and examination findings were not significantly different between seropositives and seronegatives except for cranial nerve findings, predominantly mild hearing impairment. Mean performance scores for a 15-test neuropsychological battery were within an unimpaired range for both groups, although for five tests, mean scores were significantly poorer in seropositives. After adjustment for vocabulary score, and demographic and psychosocial variables, the mean score of seropositives was significantly worse only for the Benton Visual Retention Test. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of brain were abnormal in 14 (27%) of 52 seropositives and one of 10 seronegatives (value was not significant). HIV was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 31 (61%) of 51 seropositives. The only clinical or laboratory difference between CSF culture positives and negatives was a higher CSF immunoglobulin synthesis rate in the former subjects (medians of 10.3 versus 0.1 mg/day; p = 0.03). An additional 13 seropositive subjects had immunologic evidence of central nervous system HIV infection, defined by a serum-to-CSF HIV antibody ratio of less than 5.5. Intracranial abnormalities on MR imaging were associated with CSF immunologic responses to HIV. Nervous system involvement occurred in the vast majority of men with early HIV infection, but clinically significant impairment was uncommon."
3276,0.001,1.0000,"Previous cases of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been reported in the literature. The role of HIV in PH is still debatable. The purpose of this report was to analyze whether HIV plays a direct or indirect role in PH pathogenesis. Between February and November 1997, 56 HIV-infected patients with cardiac symptoms and signs were studied by serial color Doppler echocardiography. In four patients (7.1%), PH not related to other well-known associated conditions, was disclosed. In spite of a low serum HIV RNA viral load and a high-efficacy antiretroviral therapy, including a protease inhibitor in two patients, PH developed and worsened. It could be hypothesized that in some patients with an individual immunogenetic predisposition, a high secretion of cytokines and endothelin-1 stimulated by an unidentified pathogen different from HIV could lead to PH. Antiretroviral therapy seems not to prevent or reduce right ventricle pressure gradient in PH."
5121,0.001,1.0000,"HBV-DNA measured by the spot hybridization technique, was found in the sera of 28 of 106 (26.4%) anti-HBe positive carriers of HBsAg. Dane particle-associated HBeAg, HBcAg and HBV-specific DNA-polymerase activity were found in the sera of nine (8.5%), five (4.7%) and two (1.9%) of these patients, respectively. All carriers with serum HBV-DNA had chronic liver disease and 18 had intrahepatic delta-Ag and serum anti-delta at titers higher than 1/5000. Intrahepatic HBcAg was detected in the nuclei of 90% of delta negative individuals; 50% of them also had cytoplasmic fluorescence. Only two of the 18 patients with intrahepatic delta-Ag (11%) had HBcAg in the liver. Viral nucleic acid was not found in the sera of 15 other patients with chronic hepatitis, seven of whom had intrahepatic delta-Ag. Serum HBV-DNA was also negative in the remaining 63 symptomless carriers of HBsAg lacking markers of delta infection. Interestingly, although DNA-polymerase negative, some sera gave autoradiographic spots of high optical density. HBV-DNA was detected in them at concentrations typical of sera which are usually both DNA-polymerase and HBeAg positive. Detection of HBV-DNA in serum represents the most direct and sensitive in vitro assay for assessing HBV infectivity and characterizes HBsAg carriers with HBV-related liver damage and ongoing HBV replication independently from the state of HBeAg/anti-HBe system. In the Mediterranean area, the majority of anti-HBe positive carriers with serum HBV-DNA have chronic liver disease and delta infection."
7390,0.001,1.0000,"Epidemiological analyses indicate a decreasing level of hepatitis D (HDV) infections in most developed countries during the last 15 years. Romania, however, is one of the European countries that still has high morbidity from HDV; this study was performed in order to estimate the HDV prevalence in the Bucharest area. Three thousand four hundred sixty-one hepatitis B (HBV) infected patients were invited to participate and 1,094 were recruited. Serum anti-HDV IgG was detected in 223 patients indicating a hepatitis D seroprevalence of 20.4% (95% CI = 18.1-22.9) in patients chronically infected with HBV, less than that seen in previous studies. Seroprevalence was not gender related, but patients over 40 years were more likely to have anti-HDV antibodies, RR = 1.9 (1.2; 3.0). Detectable hepatitis D viraemia was found in 67.7% of the patients who were positive for anti-HDV. The HDV genotype was characterized for 40 isolates; all were very similar and belonged to genotype 1. Serum HBV-DNA was detectable less frequently in patients positive for anti-HDV than in patients infected with HBV alone: 68.5% versus 89.3%, OR 3.9 (1.7; 10.0), but the extent of this HDV replicative dominance varies with the sensitivity of the HBV-DNA detection. 19.3% of the subjects who tested positive for anti-HDV IgG had a HBV-DNA level higher than four logs. This high prevalence prompts the need for better HBV vaccination coverage and measures to prevent super infection with HDV in patients infected with HBV."
3812,0.001,1.0000,"Complete virions of hepatitis B virus (HBV) contain a DNA genome that is enclosed in a capsid composed of the HBV core antigen (HBcAg), which is in turn surrounded by a lipid envelope studded with viral surface antigens (HBsAg). In addition, HBV-infected cells release subviral particles composed of HBsAg only (HBsAg 'spheres' and 'filaments') or HBsAg enveloping HBcAg but devoid of viral DNA ('empty virions'). The hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), a soluble antigen related to HBcAg, is also secreted in some HBV-infected patients. The goals of this study were to explore the levels of empty virions in HBV-infected patients before and during therapy with the nucleotide analog tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) that inhibits HBV DNA synthesis and the relationships of empty virions to complete virions, HBsAg and HBeAg. HBV DNA, HBcAg and HBsAg levels were determined in serum samples from 21 patients chronically infected with HBV and enrolled in clinical TDF studies. Serum levels of empty virions were found to exceed levels of DNA-containing virions, often by ≥ 100-fold. Levels of both empty and complete virions varied and were related to the HBeAg status. When HBV DNA replication was suppressed by TDF, empty virion levels remained unchanged in most but were decreased (to the limit of detection) in some patients who also experienced significant decrease or loss of serum HBsAg. In conclusion, empty virions are present in the serum of chronic hepatitis B patients at high levels and may be useful in monitoring response to antiviral therapy."
5618,0.001,1.0000,"Monocyte activation during HIV-1 infection is associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory markers and increased risk for premature development of age-related diseases. Because activated monocytes primarily use glucose to support cellular metabolism, we hypothesized that chronic monocyte activation during HIV-1 infection induces a hypermetabolic response with increased glucose uptake. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) expression and glucose uptake by monocyte subpopulations in HIV-seropositive (HIV(+)) treatment-naive individuals (n = 17), HIV(+) individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy with viral loads below detection (n = 11), and HIV-seronegative (HIV(-)) individuals (n = 16). Surface expression of Glut1 and cellular uptake of the fluorescent glucose analog 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl) amino)-2 deoxyglucose were analyzed by flow cytometry on monocyte subpopulations. Irrespective of treatment status, monocytes from HIV(+) persons had significantly increased surface expression of Glut1 compared with those from HIV(-) controls. Nonclassical (CD14(+)CD16(++)) and intermediate (CD14(++)CD16(+)) monocyte subpopulations showed higher Glut1 expression than did classical (CD14(++)CD16(-)) monocytes. Intermediate monocytes from treatment-naive HIV(+) individuals also showed increased uptake of 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl) amino)-2 deoxyglucose compared with those from HIV(-) controls. Our results show that HIV infection is associated with increased glucose metabolism in monocytes and that Glut1 expression by proinflammatory monocytes is a potential marker of inflammation in HIV-infected subjects. However, the possibility exists whereby other Gluts such as Glut3 and Glut4 may also support the influx of glucose into activated and inflammatory monocyte populations. "
7686,0.001,1.0000,"To investigate the clinical, virologic and immunologic consequences of planned treatment interruptions in chronically HIV-infected patients. One hundred forty-one patients with undetectable viral load for at least 6 months and CD4+ T cells count greater than 500 per microliter were recruited. Their antiretroviral therapy was stopped and clinical, analytic, virologic, and immunologic data were recorded at baseline, during discontinuation, and after restarting treatment. Viral load rebound after discontinuation in 137 (97%) patients, and was similar to prehighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) levels. A rapid decrease in CD4+ T-cell count (median, 240 cells per microliter), was observed in the first 3 months in all patients, with pronounced differences between them. After a median follow-up of 36 months, 45.5% patients were still without therapy. Factors related to a more severe decline were a prior lower CD4+ T nadir (<200 cells per microliter) before starting HAART, a greater increase (>500 cells per microliter) with it, a higher CD4+ T-cell count before interruption (>800 cells per microliter) and a higher viral load rebound after it. The increase in CD4+ T-cell counts after reinitiation was slower than the decline and only 55% of patients have regained the preinterruption levels at 12 months of follow- up. Twelve infectious events were registered. Treatment failure related to drug resistance was observed in two patients. Planned treatment interruptions may be safe in selected patients with previous CD4+ T cell nadir greater than 200 cells per microliter and pre-HAART VL less than 55.000 copies per milliliter, but should be not recommended in patients with the prognostic factors related to a rapid decline described in this study. Furthermore, there is a considerable concern about the development of drug resistance and the possibility of an incomplete immune reconstitution after the treatment interruption in some patients."
3916,0.001,1.0000,"Numerous African primates are infected with simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). It is now well established that the clade of SIVs infecting west-central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) represent the progenitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), whereas HIV-2 results from different cross-species transmissions of SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys). We present here the first molecular epidemiological survey of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVwrc) in wild-living western red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus badius badius) which are frequently hunted by the human population and represent a favourite prey of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). We collected faecal samples (n=88) and we assessed individual discrimination by microsatellite analyses and visual observation. We tested the inferred 53 adult individuals belonging to two neighbouring habituated groups for presence of SIVwrc infection by viral RNA (vRNA) detection. We amplified viral polymerase (pol) (650 bp) and/or envelope (env) (570 bp) sequences in 14 individuals, resulting in a minimal prevalence of 26% among the individuals sampled, possibly reaching 50% when considering the relatively low sensitivity of viral RNA detection in faecal samples. With a few exceptions, phylogenetic analysis of pol and env sequences revealed a low degree of intragroup genetic diversity and a general viral clustering related to the social group of origin. However, we found a higher intergroup diversity. Behavioural and demographic data collected previously from these communities indicate that red colobus monkeys live in promiscuous multi-male societies, where females leave their natal group at the sub-adult stage of their lives and where extra-group copulations or male immigration have been rarely observed. The phylogenetic data we obtained seem to reflect these behavioural characteristics. Overall, our results indicate that wild-living red colobus represent a substantial reservoir of SIVwrc. Moreover, because of their frequent association with other monkey species, the predation pressure exerted by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and by poachers around and inside the park, simian to simian and simian to human SIVwrc cross-species transmission cannot be excluded."
9584,0.001,1.0000,"The immune response to viral glycoproteins is often directed against conformation- and/or glycosylation-dependent structures; synthetic peptides and bacterially expressed proteins are inadequate probes for the mapping of such epitopes. This report describes a retroviral vector system that presents such native epitopes on chimeric glycoproteins in which protein fragments of interest are fused to the C terminus of the N-terminal domain of the murine leukemia virus surface protein, gp70. The system was used to express two disulfide-bonded domains from gp120, the surface protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), that include potent neutralization epitopes. The resulting fusion glycoproteins were synthesized at high levels and were efficiently transported and secreted. A fusion protein containing the HXB2 V1/V2 domain was recognized by an HIVIIIB-infected patient serum as well as by 17 of 36 HIV-1 seropositive hemophiliac, homosexual male and intravenous drug user patient sera. Many of these HIV+ human sera reacted with V1/V2 domains from several HIV-1 clones expressed in fusion glycoproteins, indicating the presence of cross-reactive antibodies against epitopes in the V1/V2 domain. Recognition of gp(1-263):V1/V2HXB2 by the HIVIIIB-infected human patient serum was largely blocked by synthetic peptides matching V1 but not V2 sequences, while recognition of this construct by a broadly cross-reactive hemophiliac patient serum was not blocked by individual V1 or V2 peptides or by mixtures of these peptides. A construct containing the V3 domain of the IIIB strain of HIV-1, gp(1-263):V3HXB2, was recognized by sera from a human and a chimpanzee that had been infected by HIVIIIB but not by sera from hemophiliac patients who had been infected with HIV-1 of MN-like V3 serotype. The reactive sera had significantly higher titers when assayed against gp(1-263):V3HXB2 than when assayed against matching V3 peptides. Immunoprecipitation of this fusion glycoprotein by the human serum was only partially blocked by V3 peptide, indicating that this infected individual produced antibodies against epitopes in V3 that were expressed on the fusion glycoprotein but not by synthetic peptides. These data demonstrated that the chimeric glycoproteins described here effectively present native epitopes present in the V1/V2 and V3 domains of gp120 and provide efficient methods for detection of antibodies directed against native epitopes in these regions and for characterization of such epitopes."
3889,0.001,1.0000,"No evidence-based interventions (EBIs) have been designed for implementation during the critical period when HIV-infected prisoners are being transitioned from prison to the community. We therefore conducted formative research aimed at systematically selecting and adapting an EBI that integrates HIV risk reduction and adherence to antiretroviral therapy to implement among HIV-infected prisoners transitioning back to the community. Our formative research involved a critical examination of established EBIs and associated published reports complemented by data elicited through structured interviews with key stakeholders in community and correctional settings and members of the target population. Between September 2006 and February 2007, structured one-on-one interviews were conducted with key stakeholders in the target organizations (n = 19) and with members of the target population (n = 26) in Hartford and New Haven, Connecticut. Based on the formative research, we abbreviated and adapted the Holistic Health Recovery Program targeting people living with HIV (HHRP+), an EBI, to consist of four 45-minute sessions that cover a range of prespecified topics so that participants may individually apply intervention content as needed to their own HIV risk profile and antiretroviral adherence issues. The EBI was adapted so that it could be provided in an individual or group format and delivered in either consecutive or weekly sessions and so that it could be provided within the prison system and delivered just prior to release, or in a community-based setting where it could be delivered immediately after release. This study provides a comprehensive exemplar of the process of selecting and adapting an EBI taking into account both empirical evidence and input from target organization stakeholders and target population members in real-world settings where high-risk populations are concentrated."

The world's second-most populous country, India, is experiencing a highly varied HIV epidemic, which appears to be stable or diminishing in some parts while growing at a modest rate in others. Quality of life (QOL) of HIV/AIDS patients is becoming an important component of overall assessment of health care and management in health care settings. It is one of the indicators effectiveness of management of PLHAS. The objective of this study was to determine the QOL of patients with HIV/AIDS in New Delhi. Purposive sampling was used to identify subjects from the antiretroviral therapy clinic (ART) in Lok Nayak hospital. 180 patients were interviewed with the WHOQOL-HIV instrument. This questionnaire included demographic data, multi-item scales and six domains namely physical, psychological, level of independence, social relationships, environment and spirituality religion. Study subjects were aged between 20-56 years. Mean age of all study subjects was 33.85 +/- 7.01 years, comprising of 34.4 females. More than 50% of the total subjects had received less than secondary school education. All domains have higher scores for women than men except the psychological domain. Correlation of scores of six domains with overall QOL score and among individual domains was statistically significant. Younger people showed poorer QOL and level of education correlated positively with all domains of QOL Overall results indicate that quality of life of AIDS attending Lok Nayak hospital is satisfactory."

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were assessed at 6 months of age for 191 HIV-exposed uninfected infants enrolled in a trial of multivitamins (not including vitamin D) in Tanzania. A total of 66 infants (34.6%) were classified as vitamin D deficient (<20 ng/ml), 93 (48.7%) as vitamin D insufficient (20-30 ng/ml) and 32 (16.8%) as vitamin D sufficient (≥30 ng/ml). Independent risk factors for vitamin D deficiency were sampling during the rainy season and infant wasting. Infant breastfeeding, maternal CD4 T-cell count, maternal wasting status and maternal receipt of antiretroviral therapy were not associated with vitamin D deficiency. Low levels of vitamin D were highly prevalent among HIV-exposed uninfected infants in Tanzania, and longitudinal studies and clinical trials of supplementation are needed to assess the impact on child health.

267,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection represents a risk factor for thrombotic microangiopathy. HIV-associated thrombotic microangiopathies encompass two entities with distinct pathophysiology, clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura associated with human immunodeficiency virus is typically characterized by a sudden onset in a patient with a moderate immune deficiency and a few events of opportunistic diseases, and a profound acquired deficiency in the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease ADAMTS13. This diagnosis requires a well-codified management including daily therapeutic plasma exchanges, a highly active antiretroviral therapy and eventually immunomodulatory drugs. The prognosis is good with a response rate and an overall survival comparable to that of HIV-negative thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. On the opposite, HIV-associated thrombotic microangiopathy with a progressive onset that occurs in profoundly immunocompromised patients with past history of multiple opportunistic diseases usually have a detectable ADAMTS13 activity and a worse prognosis. Usual treatment is poorly efficient. Forthcoming studies should assess the role of immunomodulatory drugs such as rituximab in the setting of HIV-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, and identify possible risk factors associated with the occurrence of these diseases."
4418,0.001,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly reduced the risk of early death from opportunistic infections and extended the lifespan of people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Thus, many complications and organic damage in the HIV-infected population emerge. Cardiovascular disease as coronary artery disease has become a matter of particular concern. Its incidence is greatly increased in the HIV-infected population over that of people of the same age in the absence of general cardiovascular risk factors. Despite several clinical and laboratory studies in the association between HIV infection and cardiovascular disease, the pathogenic mechanisms of this significant clinical problem are largely unknown and are now under active investigation. Endothelial dysfunction is possibly the most plausible link between HIV infection and atherosclerosis. Increased expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and endothelial adhesion molecule (E-selectin) and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL-6 has been reported in HIV-positive patients. The effect of HAART on endothelial function in HIV-positive patients is also demonstrated. In this review, we focus on the recent research update of HIV-associated vascular disease and vascular injury. We analyze and discuss the recent clinical and laboratory investigations on the effect of HIV, viral protein, and HAART therapy on endothelial injury and vascular disease; identify the areas of controversy and clinical relevance; and suggest some directions for future research."
5439,0.001,1.0000,"Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) replication is a key factor in Kaposi sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and Castleman disease pathogenesis. In vitro data suggest that antivirals inhibit HHV-8 replication, but little data exist in humans. Daily oropharyngeal swabs were analyzed from HIV/HHV-8 dually infected men enrolled in three previous clinical trials of valacyclovir and famciclovir for HIV-1 and/or HSV-2 suppression. Fifty-eight participants contributed 6,036 swabs. HHV-8 was detected in 1,128 (19%) of 6,036 swabs, including 618 (21%) of 2,992 on placebo, 323 (15%) of 2,221 on valacyclovir, and 187 (23%) of 823 on famciclovir. After adjusting for baseline HIV viral load and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use, an 18% reduction in HHV-8 shedding frequency (IRR 0.822; P = 0.011) was found in participants on valacyclovir and a 30% reduction (IRR 0.700; P < 0.001) on famciclovir. HAART was associated with an 89% (IRR 0.129; P = 0.048) reduction in HHV-8-shedding. Neither antiviral nor antiretroviral therapy was associated with decreased HHV-8 quantity. Valacyclovir and famciclovir were associated with modest but significant reductions in HHV-8 oropharyngeal shedding frequency. In contrast, HAART was a potent inhibitor of HHV-8 replication. Studies of whether antiviral therapy in combination with ART will prevent HHV-8-associated disease appear warranted."
430,0.001,1.0000,"Because of the advent of highly effective treatments, routine screening for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been recommended for many Americans. This study explored the perceived barriers surrounding routine HIV and HCV screening in a diverse sample of community health centers (CHCs). The Community Health Applied Research Network (CHARN) is a collaboration of CHCs, with a shared clinical database. In July, 2013, 195 CHARN providers working in 12 CHCs completed a survey of their attitudes and beliefs about HIV and HCV testing. Summary statistics were generated to describe the prevalence of HIV and HCV and associated demographics by CHCs. HIV and HCV prevalence ranged from 0.1% to 5.7% for HIV and from 0.1% to 3.7% for HCV in the different CHCs. About 15% of the providers cared for at least 50 individuals with HIV and the same was true for HCV. Two-thirds saw less than 10 patients with HIV and less than half saw less than 10 patients with HCV. Less than two-thirds followed USPHS guidelines to screen all patients for HIV between the ages of 13 and 64, and only 44.4% followed the guidance to screen all baby boomers for HCV. Providers with less HIV experience tended to be more concerned about routine screening practices. More experienced providers were more likely to perceive lack of time being an impediment to routine screening. Many US CHC providers do not routinely screen their patients for HIV and HCV. Although additional education about the rationale for routine screening may be indicated, incentives to compensate providers for the additional time they anticipate spending in counseling may also facilitate increased screening rates."
2749,0.001,1.0000,"Pneumonia is one of the most frequent complications in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-patients with Pneumocystis carinii as the leading cause. The true prevalence of atypical agents such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, C. trachomatis, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in this population of patients is unknown as the currently used method for diagnosing these agents is measurement of antibody levels. However, this method is of limited value in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients who may have a compromised antibody response. To evaluate the prevalence of Chlamydia spp., Legionella spp. and M. pneumoniae in HIV-infected patients with pulmonary disease, this retrospective study has applied inhibitor-controlled polymerase chain reaction analyses on 103 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids representing 103 episodes of pneumonia in 83 HIV-positive patients. L. pneumophila was detected in 1% of the BAL fluids and M. pneumoniae was found as a coexisting pathogen in 2% of the samples. Chlamydia spp. could not be detected in any of the BAL fluids. By culture and staining methods 106 other microorganisms were detected with P. carinii and Streptococcus pneumoniae as the most frequently occurring. Pneumonia due to Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila or Mycoplasma pneumoniae seems to be rare in Danish human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, but might be considered as a possible cause in cases of treatment failure."
1202,0.001,1.0000,"Nutritional support of patients with HIV or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has many similarities to other disease states in that the same nutritional products and techniques are used. Some patients with HIV, and many with AIDS without secondary infection, experience a metabolic milieu similar to patients with cancer cachexia. In providing dietary counselling to the HIV patient, we encounter many of the obstacles that must be overcome to improve nutrition in cancer: anorexia, gastrointestinal discomfort, lethargy, and poor nutrient utilization, which limit the ability for nutritional repletion. When a secondary infection is superimposed on HIV, patients resemble more highly catabolic trauma patients or patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), where, despite aggressive efforts to feed, there is usually a net nitrogen wasting leading to the more rapid development of cachexia. However, even in this setting, feeding will limit substantially net catabolism when compared to total starvation. Because the nutritional needs of HIV patients vary greatly, individual strategies have to be designed as the patient moves through the stages of disease. Patients are generally able to consume adequate nutrition either as regular food or dietary supplements during the latency period of viral replication. Once secondary infections become prevalent, artificial diets administered by tube or by vein may be required during the period of active secondary infections, with dietary supplements often helpful during more quiescent periods. Patients with HIV are among the most challenging for clinicians providing nutritional support. Knowledge from treatment of patients with other diseases may be useful, but more data must be gathered on the unique aspects of aetiology and treatment of the anorexia, malabsorption, and ultimate wasting associated with AIDS."
9162,0.001,1.0000,"We present health and demographic surveillance system data to assess associations with health care utilization and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) service receipt in a high HIV prevalence area of western Kenya. Eighty-six percent of 15,302 residents indicated a facility/clinician for routine medical services; 60% reported active (within the past year) attendance. Only 34% reported a previous HIV test, and self-reported HIV prevalence was 6%. Active attendees lived only slightly closer to their reported service site (2.8 versus 3.1 km; P < 0.001) compared with inactive attendees. Multivariate analysis showed that younger respondents (< 30 years of age) and active and inactive attendees were more likely to report an HIV test compared with non-attendees; men were less likely to report HIV testing. Despite traveling farther for HIV services (median distance = 4.4 km), 77% of those disclosing HIV infection reported HIV care enrollment. Men and younger respondents were less likely to enroll in HIV care. Socioeconomic status was not associated with HIV service use. Distance did not appear to be the major barrier to service receipt. The health and demographic surveillance system data identified patterns of service use that are useful for future program planning."
5311,0.001,1.0000,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults; however, this population may be less likely to receive interventions during hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The degree to which this disparity can be attributed to poorly controlled HIV infection is unknown.In this large cohort study, we used the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) to compare rates of cardiac procedures among patients with asymptomatic HIV-infection, symptomatic acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and uninfected adults hospitalized with ACS from 2009 to 2012. Multivariable analysis was used to compare procedure rates by HIV status, with appropriate weighting to account for NIS sampling design including stratification and hospital clustering.The dataset included 1,091,759 ACS hospitalizations, 0.35% of which (n = 3783) were in HIV-infected patients. Patients with symptomatic AIDS, asymptomatic HIV, and uninfected patients differed by sex, race, and income status. Overall rates of cardiac catheterization and revascularization were 53.3% and 37.4%, respectively. In multivariable regression, we found that relative to uninfected patients, those with symptomatic AIDS were less likely to undergo catheterization (odds ratio [OR] 0.48, confidence interval [CI] 0.43-0.55), percutaneous coronary intervention (OR 0.69, CI 0.59-0.79), and coronary artery bypass grafting (0.75, CI 0.61-0.93). No difference was seen for those with asymptomatic HIV relative to uninfected patients (OR 0.93, CI 0.81-1.07; OR 1.06, CI 0.93-1.21; OR 0.88, CI 0.72-1.06, respectively).We found that lower rates of cardiovascular procedures in HIV-infected patients were primarily driven by less frequent procedures in those with AIDS."
2299,0.001,1.0000,"Most HIV positive people have not been tested for viral hepatitis and their treatments have not been optimized for possible co-infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the serological pattern of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections among antiretroviral (ARV)-naive and -experienced HIV co-infected adults in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A total of 500 frozen HIV positive serum and plasma samples collected from ARV-naive (n = 250) and -experienced (n = 250) adults were randomly selected and screened for HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg and anti-HCV using rapid two-site sandwich immunochromatographic assay. The test was performed at Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology, Addis Ababa University. Positive specimens for HBsAg and anti-HCV markers were further confirmed using third generation ELISA. Of the 500 specimens tested, 15 (3 %), 58 (11.6 %), 3 (0.6 %), 18 (3.6 %), 3 (0.6 %) and 1 (0.2 %) were positive for HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HCV, HBsAg and HBeAg, and HBsAg and anti-HBs markers, respectively. No specimen tested positive for both HBeAg and anti-HBs, and 442 (88.4 %) individuals were non-immune to HBV. Of the 250 ARV-naive individuals, 8 (3.2 %), 33 (13.2 %), 2 (0.8 %), 10 (4 %), 2 (0.8 %), and 1 (0.4 %) were positive for HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HCV, HBsAg and HBeAg, and HBsAg and anti-HBs markers, respectively. Of the 250 ARV-experienced individuals, 7 (2.8 %), 25 (10 %), 1 (0.4 %), 8 (3.2 %), 1 (0.4 %), and 0 (0 %) were positive for HBsAg, Anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HCV, HBsAg and HBeAg, and HBsAg and anti-HBs markers, respectively. In summary, seroprevalence of HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV co-infections was lower in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, than in Sub-Saharan Africa and globally. HBV and HCV infections were not significantly different between HIV positive subjects who were or who were not on ARV. This suggests that the two groups have equal chance of being infected with these two viruses; despite this, disease progression could be different."
4326,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection causes progressive depletion of CD4/HIV-receptor-positive T helper lymphocytes, ultimately leading to AIDS. The major HIV reservoir and site of T-helper cell infection in lymphoid tissues, however, has remained poorly defined. The authors used in situ hybridization in combination with immunohistologic labeling techniques to identify the phenotype of HIV-infected cells in lymph nodes from patients at different stages of HIV-infection. The number of HIV-infected macrophages, widely considered the major site of HIV replication, was extremely low. There was no evidence for HIV-infection of endothelial and interdigitating reticulum cells. However, HIV RNA was found in small but consistent proportions of CD45RO-positive T cells and in the vast majority of follicular dendritic cells (FDC) in a pattern suggestive of active infection in addition to HIV-immunocomplex trapping on cell membranes. FDC may therefore be a major HIV reservoir and since T-helper cells travel through the FDC meshwork during their migration within lymphoreticular tissues, it appears likely that HIV-replicating T cells may infect FDC, which then infect new T cells, thus causing a gradual dissemination of the virus to all FDC and thereby a steadily increasing infection of T-helper/memory cells within germinal centers. This results in CD4+ T cell depletion, and ultimately, in immunodeficiency."
431,0.001,1.0000,"Human adenovirus E1A oncoprotein activates or represses transcription from a variety of viral and cellular promoters by several complex mechanisms. The E1A products, 289R and 243R, have differential effects on transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR). Previous reports indicate that repression of HIV-1 LTR-directed gene expression by E1A 243R is mediated through the kappa B enhancer elements located between nucleotides -105 and -82 relative to the transcription initiation start site (+1). Results from this study suggest a novel mechanism for transcriptional repression of the HIV-1 LTR by E1A 243R that is enhancer-independent and that is mediated through basal HIV-1 promoter elements. Transient expression assays, in which 5'-truncated or site-directed mutant HIV-1 LTR-CAT reporters were tested for their response to repression mediated by wild-type or mutant 243R, demonstrate that LTR sequences upstream of -31 relative to the transcription initiation start site (+1) and inclusive of the enhancer elements are dispensable for 243R-mediated repression. The ability of 243R to repress HIV-1 basal promoter activity requires both an intact N-terminus of E1A 243R and the TATA element within the HIV-1 promoter. These results support a novel mechanism for E1A 243R-induced transcriptional repression that is enhancer-independent and that targets directly the general transcription machinery."

All dialysed patients were hepatitis A virus (HAV) positive. Prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibodies (anti-HBs), and hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc) was 14 of 66, 21% (95% confidence interval (CI): 12-33%), 5 of 66, 8% (95%CI: 5-22%), and 50 of 66, 76% (95%CI: 64-85%), respectively. Antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) prevalence was 57 of 66, 86% (95%CI: 76-94%). No human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive case was found. Prevalence of past herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection was 29% (95%CI: 18-41%). Two patients (3%, 95%CI: 0-10%) were positive for Treponema pallidum and 18% (95%CI: 10-30%) were human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) antibody positive. Four hundred and fifty-two subjects were recruited for comparison. Markers of past HAV infection was associated with haemodialysis (Fisher s exact test p-value=0.037). Dialysed patients were at a higher risk of being HBsAg positive than others: the sex- and age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 5.18 (95%CI: 1.87-14.32). Anti-HBc positivity was strongly associated with haemodialysis: the sex- and age-adjusted OR was 6.43 (95%CI: 3.22-12-85). Anti-HCV positivity was 86% and 1% in presence and absence of haemodialysis, respectively. The Fisher s exact test for association proved a strong association between haemodialysis and HCV (p-value<0.0001). The OR for association between haemodialysis and HSV-2 positivity was 3.20 (95%CI: 1.46-7.00). Significant associations were also observed between haemodialysis status and antibodies to Treponema pallidum (Fisher s exact test p-value=0.044). In Kosovo, the prevalence of viral hepatitis infection and other viral infections and Treponema pallidum among dialysed patients is high, indicating major ongoing nosocomial transmission."
8217,0.001,1.0000,The epidemiology of mucosal candidal colonization and candidiasis was studied in a multicenter cohort of 871 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and 439 demographically and behaviorally similar HIV-seronegative women. Cross-sectional analyses at baseline revealed that oropharyngeal colonization with Candida species was more prevalent among seropositive women and among women reporting recent cigarette smoking and injection drug use. Oropharyngeal candidiasis was also more prevalent among seropositive women. Both oropharyngeal colonization and candidiasis were significantly associated with a lower median CD4 lymphocyte count among seropositive women. Vaginal candidal colonization was more prevalent among seropositive women and among those reporting recent injection drug use and current insulin or oral antihyperglycemic therapy. Vaginal candidiasis was equally likely to be diagnosed in seropositive and seronegative women and was not significantly related to recent sexual contact. Neither vaginal colonization nor candidiasis was significantly related to a lower median CD4 lymphocyte count among seropositive women. Baseline evaluation indicated differences in the epidemiology of oropharyngeal and vaginal candidal colonization and candidiasis in HIV-seropositive women and suggested possible variation in pathogenesis of candidal infection at these two mucosal sites.
3498,0.001,1.0000,"Intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in Seattle (n = 213) were studied to identify the prevalence and predominant types of and risk factors for human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection. Detailed questionnaires, serologic screening, and polymerase chain reaction analysis (for a subset) were used. Evidence of HTLV infection was found in 16.5%, of which 89% were HTLV-II. HTLV infection was significantly associated with nonwhite race, older age, more years of intravenous drug use, prior use of heroin, history of gonorrhea, history of any sexually transmitted disease, hepatitis B virus infection, and antibody to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). By stepwise logistic regression analysis, associations persisted with race, age, hepatitis B markers, and HSV-2. Thus, the strong association of HTLV with hepatitis B, a marker for injection behavior, and the independent association with HSV-2 infection, a sexually transmitted pathogen, suggest similarities in the epidemiology of HTLV and human immunodeficiency virus infections in IVDUs."
6288,0.001,1.0000,"Zidovudine is widely prescribed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Trimethoprim and dapsone are commonly used in the management of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected patients. To examine the pharmacokinetic interactions among these drugs, eight HIV-infected patients (26 to 43 years old) with a mean CD4 count of 524.4 +/- 405.7 cells per mm3 received zidovudine (200 mg), trimethoprim (200 mg), and dapsone (100 mg) as single agents and in two- and three-drug combinations. Blood and urine samples were collected at a specified time and analyzed for zidovudine, zidovudine-glucuronide, trimethoprim, dapsone, and monoacetyl-dapsone concentrations under single-dose and steady-state conditions. Zidovudine did not influence the pharmacokinetic disposition of dapsone or trimethoprim. Dapsone had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of zidovudine. Trimethoprim significantly decreased the renal clearance of zidovudine by 58% (5.0 +/- 1.8 versus 2.1 +/- 0.5 ml/min/kg of body weight [P < 0.05]). There was a concurrent 54% decrease in the mean urinary recovery of zidovudine (11.7 +/- 3.5 versus 5.4 +/- 3.0 [P < 0.05]), and the metabolic ratio was decreased by 78% (0.32 +/- 0.4 versus 0.07 +/- 0.05 [P < 0.05]). The mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 6 h of the zidovudine-glucuronide/ zidovudine ratio was unchanged. We conclude that zidovudine, trimethoprim, and dapsone can be coadministered to patients with AIDS without significant pharmacokinetic interaction. However, in AIDS patients with liver impairment and impaired glucuronidation, doses of zidovudine may need to be decreased."
4638,0.001,1.0000,"The epidemiology of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is important for health planners and service providers. A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the seroprevalence and associated risk factors for markers of HBV (HBsAg) and anti-HCV among hemodialysis patients at the Ahmed Gasim hemodialysis unit, Sudan. Structured questionnaires were used to obtain socio-demographic data and sera were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to HCV (anti-HCV). Of the 353 patients enrolled in the study, HBsAg and anti-HCV were detected in 16 (4.5%) and 30 (8.5%) patients, respectively. None of the patients were co-infected with HBV and HCV. Multivariate analysis showed that duration of dialysis was significantly associated with anti-HCV seropositivity [OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.2-1.3; P = 0.024]. No other socio-demographic or clinical characteristics (age, sex, level of education, history of surgery, and number of units of blood transfused) were significantly associated with HBsAg or anti-HCV seropositivity. The results of this study suggest that HBsAg and anti-HCV have low prevalence among hemodialysis patients in Khartoum. Longer duration of dialysis was a risk factor for anti-HCV."
1891,0.001,1.0000,"The human placenta is relatively resistant to Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), but obstetric complications associated with inflammatory processes, including chorioamnionitis and spontaneous preterm delivery, are associated with increased rates of vertical transmission. It was hypothesized that the pro-inflammatory mediator tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), which promotes HIV-1 transmission across endothelial membranes, increases HIV-1 transmission across the placenta. Flow cytometry and immunostaining studies were performed, which demonstrated that the HIV-1 receptors CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 were not expressed by villous trophoblast cells. Consequently, primary villous trophoblast cells were not infected with cell-free HIV-1 isolates, as measured by in situ PCR and quantitative PCR, but villous trophoblast cells were infected by HIV-1-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). HIV-1 from infected PBMC was rapidly transported across confluent transformed trophoblast cell monolayers by transcytosis, and TNF-alpha significantly upregulated transcytosis of HIV-1 across the trophoblast layer without disrupting cell viability or confluency. Inhibitors of TNF-alpha (antibodies against TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha receptors) and an anti-inflammatory drug (tenidap) significantly reduced transcytosis rates. It was concluded that the villous trophoblast is resistant to infection by cell-free HIV-1 but susceptible to transcytosis of HIV-1 from infected PBMC, and inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha may play a critical role in promoting maternal-fetal transmission of HIV-1."
6357,0.001,1.0000,"To identify the influence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype on development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and clinical outcome in chronic HBV infection, 26 consecutive cirrhotic patients infected with HBV subtype adw were investigated prospectively. HBV serology was undertaken using subtype-specific antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigens. The HBV genotype was determined by sequencing directly the polymerase chain reaction products of the HBV S gene. When HCC occurred, patients underwent transcatheter arterial embolization therapy. If tumor necrosis was incomplete, additional embolization therapy was carried out after a 3- to 4-month interval. At a median follow-up of 14.1 years (range 2.2 to 31.7), HCC occurred in 9 (35%) of 26 patients. Nineteen patients were infected with genotype B and 7 with genotype C. Four of the 19 genotype B patients (21%) and 5 of the 7 genotype C patients (71%) developed HCC (P = 0.058). Patient age (<45 years or 45 < or = ) at diagnosis of cirrhosis was the only significant independent factor influencing liver carcinogenesis by multiple logistic regression analysis and Cox's regression analysis (P = 0.0069 and 0.029, respectively). When analysis was limited to the age of 45 years or more at the last visit, genotype was the only contributory factor to HCC development by univariate analysis (P = 0.038). Whereas genotype B patients responded well to embolization therapy and had no recurrence of HCC for a prolonged period of time, genotype C patients showed poor responses and died of hepatic failure due to rapid HCC progression despite embolization therapy. The cumulative incidence of survival was significantly higher in the genotype B group (P = 0.0049). The HBV genotype correlated with the development of HCC, response to embolization therapy, and recurrence of HCC. Determination of HBV genotype may be useful in predicting outcomes in HBV subtype adw-related cirrhosis."
1451,0.001,1.0000,"Details of the molecular interactions between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and its host cell during the infection process are not entirely clear. Building on recent reports by Lehr and Zimmer (1986, DMW 111, 1001-1002) that the membrane-reactive, anti-epileptic drug diphenylhydantoin (dilantin or phenytoin) (PHT) inhibited binding of HIV to lymphocytes, we hypothesized that understanding the relevant effects of this drug on cells may shed light on aspects of HIV-1 infection. We found that PHT inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, de novo infection of various T-cell lines as well as a monocytic cell line. Moderate inhibition of HIV-1 infection was observed with drug concentrations that are therapeutic in vivo for epilepsy (approximately 20 micrograms/ml), and no concentrations used induced deleterious effects on cell growth or viability. Surprisingly, treatment of chronically infected H9 cells reduced HIV p24 expression within 1-6 weeks according to dose. This apparent induction into latency was not inhibited by cotreatment of the chronically infected cells with 5-azacytidine, which indicated that PHT was not inducing latency by induction of methylation of the viral DNA. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that PHT did not significantly reduce cell-surface expression of CD4. The possibility remained that the drug inhibited HIV infection due to its known effects on calcium-dependent cellular processes. Subsequent measurements of intracellular calcium demonstrated that an increase of [Ca2+]i occurred at least 24 hr postinfection, prior to synthesis of detectable viral structural protein p24, and that this virus-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was not due to binding of HIV to the cell. This HIV-induced rise in [Ca2+]i was significantly inhibited by PHT. PHT demonstrated variable inhibitory effects on infection of normal PHA-stimulated PBLs cultured in vitro, but it was synergistic to low-dose AZT (0.01 microgram/ml) in inhibiting infection of cell lines. Because of the known inhibitory effects of PHT on calcium-dependent biochemical processes in the cell, inhibition of HIV-1 infection by PHT suggests that calcium may play a role in HIV infection and maintenance. The drug may also be a candidate therapy for individuals infected with HIV."
6165,0.001,1.0000,"We examined the longitudinal association between alcohol use and liver fibrosis, measured by FIB-4 Score, among HIV-infected individuals by (1) antiretroviral therapy (ART) class, and (2) the presence of hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection. This was a prospective cohort study of 550 individuals in the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort initiating ART between 2000 and 2012. The relationship between alcohol consumption (defined using NIAAA categories of non-, moderate, and hazardous drinkers) and liver fibrosis (FIB-4 score) by ART class was assessed using linear mixed effects models. Additionally, we examined whether the presence of HCV modified and whether viral load mediated the relationship between alcohol use and liver fibrosis. Overall, FIB-4 levels were 15.6% higher in hazardous drinkers compared to moderate drinkers (p = 0.025) after adjusting by age, sex, and race. Hazardous drinkers on PI-based regimens had FIB-4 scores 26.9% higher than moderate drinkers (p = 0.015). However, there was no difference in FIB-4 levels between hazardous drinkers on non-PI-based regimens compared to moderate drinkers (1.83% versus moderate drinkers, p = 0.848). There was no significant difference in FIB-4 between nondrinkers and moderate drinkers, irrespective of ART regimen. These associations were not modified by HCV status or mediated by viral load changes. Individuals with hazardous alcohol consumption and on PI-based regimens had significantly increased liver fibrosis, as measured by the FIB-4. These data suggest that providers should consider level of alcohol consumption when choosing an ART regimen to minimize detrimental effects on the liver."
8654,0.001,1.0000,"Bevirimat [3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl)betulinic acid] is the first in a new class of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs that inhibit viral maturation by specifically blocking cleavage of the Gag capsid (CA) precursor, CA-SP1, to mature CA protein, resulting in defective core condensation and release of immature noninfectious virions. Four cohorts of six HIV-infected adults, with CD4 counts of >200 and plasma viral loads of 5,000 to 250,000 transcripts/ml and not currently receiving antiretroviral therapy, were randomized to receive a single oral dose of placebo, 75, 150, or 250 mg of bevirimat. Thirty blood samples for drug concentrations and 20 HIV RNA measures were collected from each subject over a 20-day period. Candidate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models were fit to individual subjects by maximum likelihood followed by Bayesian estimation; model discrimination was by corrected Akaike's Information Criterion. The bevirimat pharmacokinetics was well described by an oral two-compartment linear model (r(2), 0.98), with a mean (percent coefficient of variation) half-life of 60.3 (13.6) h and apparent oral clearance of bevirimat from the plasma compartment of 0.17 (18) liters/h. HIV RNA was modeled as being produced in infected CD4 cells, with bevirimat inhibiting infection of new CD4 cells thru a Hill-type function (r(2), 0.87). Single oral doses of bevirimat were well tolerated and demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in viral load. The average maximum reduction from baseline following the 150- and 250-mg doses was greater than 0.45 log(10), with individual patients having reductions of greater than 0.7 log(10). No bevirimat resistance mutations were detected during the course of the study."
1889,0.001,1.0000,"Virus-specific CD4(+) T-cell response at the site of inflammation is believed to play a decisive role for the course of viral disease. In hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the majority of studies focused on the peripheral blood T-cell response. In this study we analyzed intrahepatic virus-specific CD4(+) T-cell response and compared this with that in the peripheral blood. Liver and blood-derived T-cell lines were studied in 36 patients (18 with chronic hepatitis C and 18 with HCV-associated cirrhosis). Virus-specific interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production at a single cell level to various HCV-proteins (core, nonstructural [NS] 3/4, NS5) were determined by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELIspot). Phenotyping was done by fluorescent-activated cell sorter analysis. In approximately half (16 of 36 [44%]) of intrahepatic T-cell lines a significant number of IFN-gamma spots were observed, whereas this was the case in only 19% (7 of 36 T-cell lines) in the blood. In relative terms, core and nonstructural proteins were recognized with the same frequency in both compartments, but HCV-specificity was significantly more often detected in liver tissue compared with the blood. Hepatitis activity index, viral load, and alanine transaminase levels did not correlate with the detection of HCV-specific CD4(+) T cells. All T-cell lines were dominated by CD4(+) T cells. In conclusion, HCV-specific CD4(+) T cells are multispecific, compartmentalize to the liver, and produce IFN-gamma. We speculate that our data would support the concept of compartmentalization of specific T cells at the site of inflammation and that a low frequency of specific T cells is associated with failure to clear the virus and a chronic course of disease."
6395,0.001,1.0000,"Infection of macaques with live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) usually results in long-lasting efficient protection against infection with pathogenic immunodeficiency viruses. However, attenuation by deletion of regulatory genes such as nef is not complete, leading to a high viral load and fatal disease in some animals. To characterize immunological parameters and polymorphic host factors, we studied 17 rhesus macaques infected with attenuated SIVmac239ΔNU. Eight animals were able to control viral replication, whereas the remaining animals (non-controllers) displayed variable set-point viral loads. Peak viral load at 2 weeks post-infection (p.i.) correlated significantly with set-point viral load (P<0.0001). CD4(+) T-cell frequencies differed significantly soon after infection between controllers and non-controllers. Abnormal B-cell activation previously ascribed to Nef function could already be observed in non-controllers 8 weeks after infection despite the absence of Nef. Two non-controllers developed an AIDS-like disease within 102 weeks p.i. Virus from these animals transmitted to naïve animals replicated at low levels and the recipients did not develop immunodeficiency. This suggested that host factors determined differential viral load and subsequent disease course. Known Mhc class I alleles associated with disease progression in SIV WT infection only marginally influenced the viral load in Δnef-infected animals. Protection from SIVmac251 was associated with homozygosity for MHC class II in conjunction with a TLR7 polymorphism and showed a trend with initial viral replication. We speculated that host factors whose effects were usually masked by Nef were responsible for the different disease courses in individual animals upon infection with nef-deleted viruses. "
4498,0.001,1.0000,"Acute exercise is known to activate the immune system and thus could lead to increased human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication. We sought to determine whether a single acute bout of exercise, similar to what people experience when starting an intensive exercise program, has a detrimental effect on plasma HIV RNA levels. Twenty-five patients with HIV infection performed one 15-min bout of acute exercise. Absolute neutrophil counts, serum creatine phosphokinase, and 72-h urinary 3-methylhistidine (a marker of muscle protein breakdown) were measured before and after the exercise, along with plasma HIV RNA levels. There were increases in neutrophil counts (P < 0.06), serum creatine phosphokinase (P < 0. 01), and urinary 3-methylhistidine (P < 0.01) in response to exercise, indicating a mild acute-phase response with muscle proteolysis. However, mean HIV RNA, which was elevated at baseline in 22 of the 25 subjects (mean of 4 x 10(5) +/- 0.7 x 10(5) copies/ml), did not increase during the week after exercise (P = 0. 12). Small changes in RNA were seen in the three subjects with initially undetectable HIV RNA, but the significance of these changes is unclear. Acute exercise does not have a deleterious effect on HIV replication in adults with high viral loads. Because regular exercise training has not been shown to activate the acute-phase response, the lack of increased viral loads in response to an acute exercise intervention suggests that exercise training is safe in people with HIV infection."
8925,0.001,1.0000,"Ribavirin (RBV) in combination with pegylated interferon alpha (pegIFN) is currently the standard treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The development of anemia requires a reduction in RBV doses in a substantial proportion of patients, limiting their chances of treatment response. The primary goal of this study was to assess if early monitoring of RBV plasma levels could help to predict anemia as well as early HCV RNA response in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals. The secondary goal was to evaluate if antiretroviral drugs might influence RBV plasma levels. Plasma RBV concentrations were measured at weeks 4 and 12 in 98 HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals who initiated therapy with pegIFN-2a (180 microg/wk) plus RBV (800-1200 mg/d). RBV plasma levels correlated with RBV dose per kilogram of body weight (P = 0.02). Larger drops in hemoglobin levels were independently associated with higher RBV plasma levels and zidovudine (ZDV) use (P < 0.001). Likewise, higher RBV levels (P = 0.007) and HCV genotype 3 (P < 0.001) were found to be independent predictors of virologic response at week 4. Similar findings were obtained at week 12. Patients receiving ZDV concomitantly showed significantly higher RBV plasma concentrations compared with those who did not (3.28 mug/mL vs. 2.51 mug/mL; P = 0.002). RBV levels were not significantly altered by the coadministration of other nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. In summary, RBV plasma levels correlate with the development of anemia and with the achievement of an early virologic response. Therefore, early therapeutic drug monitoring might help to tailor RBV dosages, improving the efficacy and safety of anti-HCV treatment."
1847,0.001,1.0000,"About 180 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), with 3-4 million newly infected each year. Only 15-25% of acute HCV infections clear spontaneously, and the remainder persists as chronic HCV infection. More than 350,000 people die every year from hepatitis C-related liver failure and cancer. There is currently no vaccine and the standard-of-care therapies--peg-interferon alpha (pegIFN) plus ribavirin (RBV)--are expensive and have serious side effects. Also, they may be effective in only 40-50% of patients infected with HCV genotype 1, the most common HCV genotype in the US. Interleukin 28B (IL28B) genotype was recently and convincingly associated with response to pegIFN and RBV therapy. It has emerged as a robust pretreatment predictor of sustained virological response (SVR, i.e. virologic clearance) to pegIFN and RBV as well as to new triple therapy regimens that include a direct-acting antiviral agent with pegIFN and RBV and increase SVR rates as much as 75% in patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Testing for IL28B genotype may contribute to clinical decision-making and could inform clinical guidelines and public health policies."

This cross-sectional study explored social and psychosocial factors associated with adherence among adolescents with perinatal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in Panama from a gender perspective. A questionnaire developed for the study was applied to 38 adolescent patients (20 female, 18 male; median age, 14 years). Thirty-two patients (86%; one missing response) still depended on an adult to remember taking their medication, among whom 28 relied on a female relative. Although 18 (47%) patients reported to become ill no more than once a year, only 10 (26%) patients showed an undetectable viral load, and 4 (11%) patients showed no CD4 suppression. Seventeen (45%) patients recalled correctly their medication. During the week prior to the interview, 26 patients (68%) reported that they had missed at least one dose. When asked the reason for missing a dose, 23 out of 34 (68%; 4 missing responses) patients responded, ""I forgot"". Female patients gave more excuses for missing doses (mean ± SD number of excuses per female, 2.4 ± 2; per male, 1.2 ± 1; p = .02), while more male than female patients described an action plan if they ran out of medication (13 vs. 8; p = .05). Educational programs involving patients and also family members are warranted to improve adherence."
9107,0.001,1.0000,"The evolution of treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection has led to improved therapeutic efficacy. However, a major problem is the presence of side effects that require modification or withdrawal of drug therapy in 15-20% of cases. This could potentially influence the lack of sustained viral response in 50% of the cases. Side effects are common, even with pegylated interferon. This study aimed to assess the incidence and severity of infections based on the development of neutropenia associated with combined therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha2a plus ribavirin in 209 patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. All patients were administered pegylated interferon-alpha2a (180 microg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day for 24 weeks in cases of nongenotype 1, or 1000-1200 mg/day for 48 weeks for genotype 1, according to whether patients weighed more or less than 75 kg). Patients with preexisting neutropenia of any cause or cirrhosis were excluded. Neutropenia was defined as a neutrophil count (NC) of <1500 cells/microl. Neutropenia was classified into three levels during treatment: 750<or=NC<1500 (level 1), 500<or=750 (level 2), and NC<500 cells/microl (level 3). Of the 209 patients, 114 did not develop neutropenia (mean 2100+/-804 cells/microl), while 95 had an NC<1500 cells/microl (mean 1100+/-250 cells/microl). It was found that patients who developed neutropenia during treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection with a combined therapy based on pegylated interferon-alpha2a plus ribavirin did not show a higher infection rate or increased severity of the disease."
6431,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B infection is one of the infectious diseases quite common in Turkey and around the world. Hepatitis B virus infection is a significant health problem which may cause chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. With the introduction of Hepatitis B vaccine, a significant progress has been made in the prevention of HBV infections. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the characteristics of the individuals included in the risk group who admitted to our vaccination clinic, as well as their immune responses following the vaccination. Among the patients admitted to the vaccination clinic of our hospital between January 2003-December 2005 and that were included in the risk group (patients who have family members with chronic Hepatitis B infection, healthcare workers, hemodialysis patients etc.), those who were included in the vaccination program by examining the results of HBs Ag, anti-HBc and anti-HBs were evaluated in terms of their characteristics (age, gender, smoking etc.) and results of Anti-HBs score. A total of 958 people were included in the vaccination program. Upon evaluation in terms of risk factors, presence of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection in the family was found to be 80.6% (772/958), being healthcare worker was 9.2% (88/958), HCV positivity and chronic liver disease was 3.0% (29/958), being a hemodialysis patient was 2.8% (27/958), and being an oncology patient was 2.1% (20/958). Post-vaccination immune response could be evaluated in 69.8% (669/958) of patients and no responsiveness to vaccine was detected only in 8.1% (54/669) of them. Of the non-responders, 64.8% (35/54) were hemodialysis and oncology patients. Anti-HBs positivity rate following hepatitis B vaccination program was found compatible with the results of previous studies. With this vaccine of considerably high effectiveness, immunization of the entire community including primarily the risk groups should be targeted."
788,0.001,1.0000,"Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are essential components in first-line therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, long-term treatment with existing NRTIs can be associated with significant toxic side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. The identification of new NRTIs for the continued management of HIV-infected people therefore is paramount. In this report, we describe the response of a primary isolate of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) to 4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA) both in vitro and in vivo. EFdA was 3 orders of magnitude better than tenofovir (TFV), zidovudine (AZT), and emtricitabine (FTC) in blocking replication of SIV in monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro, and in a preliminary study using two SIV-infected macaques with advanced AIDS, it was highly effective at treating SIV infection and AIDS symptoms in vivo. Both animals had 3- to 4-log decreases in plasma virus burden within 1 week of EFdA therapy (0.4 mg/kg of body weight, delivered subcutaneously twice a day) that eventually became undetectable. Clinical signs of disease (diarrhea, weight loss, and poor activity) also resolved within the first month of treatment. No detectable clinical or pathological signs of drug toxicity were observed within 6 months of continuous therapy. Virus suppression was sustained until drug treatment was discontinued, at which time virus levels rebounded. Although the rebound virus contained the M184V/I mutation in the viral reverse transcriptase, EFdA was fully effective in maintaining suppression of mutant virus throughout the drug treatment period. These results suggest that expanded studies with EFdA are warranted."
6495,0.001,1.0000,"Although myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are well known for their immunosuppressive function in several pathological conditions, the role of MDSCs in hepatitis B virus infection remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the frequency and function of MDSCs in the peripheral blood and liver of 91 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. A higher percentage of MDSCs, defined as CD14(+)HLA-DR(-/low), was detected in peripheral blood of CHB patients than that of the healthy controls. Moreover, high expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and secretion of IL-10 in this population were determined. The frequency of MDSCs was positively correlated with serum viral load, but it was negatively correlated with liver inflammatory injury. These cells were also abundant in liver tissue of CHB patients and were related to necroinflammatory activity. Furthermore, we found that these cells could suppress hepatitis B virus-specific CD8(+) T cell response, including reduced proliferation and IFN-γ production, and inhibit degranulation of CD8(+) T cells, including reduced production of granzyme B and perforin. Importantly, PD-1-induced IL-10 production by MDSCs was responsible for the suppressive activity. To our knowledge, for the first time our study proved that CD14(+)HLA-DR(-/low)PD-1(+) MDSCs in CHB patients contribute to an inadequate immune response against the virus and lead to chronic infection, which represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

3662,0.001,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can suppress HIV-1 replication and normalize the chronic immune activation associated with infection, but restoration of naïve CD4+ T cell populations is slow and usually incomplete for reasons that have yet to be determined. We tested the hypothesis that damage to the lymphoid tissue (LT) fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network contributes to naïve T cell loss in HIV-1 infection by restricting access to critical factors required for T cell survival. We show that collagen deposition and progressive loss of the FRC network in LTs prior to treatment restrict both access to and a major source of the survival factor interleukin-7 (IL-7). As a consequence, apoptosis within naïve T cell populations increases significantly, resulting in progressive depletion of both naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. We further show that the extent of loss of the FRC network and collagen deposition predict the extent of restoration of the naïve T cell population after 6 month of HAART, and that restoration of FRC networks correlates with the stage of disease at which the therapy is initiated. Because restoration of the FRC network and reconstitution of naïve T cell populations are only optimal when therapy is initiated in the early/acute stage of infection, our findings strongly suggest that HAART should be initiated as soon as possible. Moreover, our findings also point to the potential use of adjunctive anti-fibrotic therapies to avert or moderate the pathological consequences of LT fibrosis, thereby improving immune reconstitution."
3863,0.001,1.0000,"Between June 1994 and May 2003, 93 of 716 (13.0%) HIV-infected patients with a median baseline cell differentiation CD4+ count of 61 x 10(6) cells/L (range, 1-1206 x 10(6) cells/L) developed 103 episodes of herpes zoster [HZ], with an incidence of 5.67 per 100 person-years (PY). The incidence of HZ in the pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era (17.21 per 100 PY) was significantly higher than that in the post-HAART era (5.05 per 100 PY) (P < 0.0001). In the first six months of enrollment, the incidence of HZ was significantly higher than that between six and 12 months both in the pre-HAART (27.65 per 100 PY versus 8.43 per 100 PY, P = 0.02) and post-HAART era (17.79 per 100 PY versus 3.39 per 100 PY, P < 0.0001). In multivariate analyses, only baseline CD4+ count remained a significant risk factor associated with HZ. HZ did not increase mortality rate either in the pre-HAART or post-HAART era, although the risk for HIV progression was significantly higher in patients with HZ (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.747, 95% confidence interval, 1.037-2.943). We conclude that the incidence of HZ was highest in the first six months of enrollment in patients at late stage of HIV infection, which did not increase with the introduction of HAART. Baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count was the most significant risk factor associated with development of HZ. HZ was associated with increased risk for HIV progression, but not mortality."
5992,0.001,1.0000,"In HIV-infected patients a low CD4:CD8 ratio can persist despite CD4 recovery with long-term antiretroviral treatment (ART). As CD4:CD8 inversion is considered a marker of immune-senescence, we aimed to assess if it was associated with the chronic inflammation state in aging patients with HIV. A total of 112 patients with a >15 year history of HIV infection and ART were included, 85 of whom were suppressed. All subjects were tested for interleukin (IL)-6, high-sensitivity (hs)-PCR, and D-dimer levels. Complete clinical, therapeutic, and hematochemical data were retrieved. Coreceptor tropism based on HIV-DNA gp120 genotyping was also available within the past 6 months. A progressive increase in the CD4:CD8 ratio over time was observed without reaching a plateau. Based on the CD4:CD8 ratio at the time of testing, patients were classified into group A (normal ratio ≥0.9) and group B (<0.9). A normal ratio was observed in 37% of patients. Variables associated with an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio were older age, nadir CD4, and detectable HIV viremia. No association between HIV subtype, coreceptor tropism, cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfections and CD4:CD8 ratio was observed. Group B patients showed a trend for a higher frequency of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia compared to group A patients, but they did not differ in IL-6, hs-PCR, and D-dimer levels or in frequency of severe non-AIDS-associated events. In conclusion, CD4:CD8 ratio normalization occurs rarely, even after several years of ART. Chronic inflammation in patients aging with HIV does not seem to be directly dependent on the CD4:CD8 ratio. However, the persistent immune dysregulation expressed by a CD4:CD8 inversion might be linked to a higher risk of non-AIDS events, especially metabolic disorders."
8843,0.001,1.0000,"Leishmania parasites cause a broad range of disease, with cutaneous afflictions being, by far, the most prevalent. Variations in disease severity and symptomatic spectrum are mostly associated to parasite species. One risk factor for the severity and emergence of leishmaniasis is immunosuppression, usually arising by coinfection of the patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Interestingly, several species of Leishmania have been shown to bear an endogenous cytoplasmic dsRNA virus (LRV) of the Totiviridae family, and recently we correlated the presence of LRV1 within Leishmania parasites to an exacerbation murine leishmaniasis and with an elevated frequency of drug treatment failures in humans. This raises the possibility of further exacerbation of leishmaniasis in the presence of both viruses, and here we report a case of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania braziliensis bearing LRV1 with aggressive pathogenesis in an HIV patient. LRV1 was isolated and partially sequenced from skin and nasal lesions. Genetic identity of both sequences reinforced the assumption that nasal parasites originate from primary skin lesions. Surprisingly, combined antiretroviral therapy did not impact the devolution of Leishmania infection. The Leishmania infection was successfully treated through administration of liposomal amphotericin B."
6581,0.001,1.0000,"Vitamin D regulates bone metabolism but has also immunoregulatory properties. In HIV-infected patients bone disorders are increasingly observed. Furthermore, low 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) levels have been associated with low CD4(+) counts, immunological hyperactivity, and AIDS progression rates. Few studies have examined the vitamin D status in HIV-infected patients. This study will specifically focus on the effects of antiretroviral agents on vitamin D status. Furthermore, the effect of vitamin D status on CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART will be evaluated. Among 252 included patients the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<35 nmol/liter from April to September and <25 nmol/liter from October to March) was 29%. Female sex, younger age, dark skin, and NNRTI treatment were significant risk factors in univariate analysis, although in multivariate analyses skin pigmentation remained the only independent risk factor. Median 25(OH)D(3) levels were significantly lower in white NNRTI-treated patients [54.5(27.9-73.8) nmol/liter] compared to white PI-treated patients [77.3 (46.6-100.0) nmol/liter, p = 0.007], while among nonwhites no difference was observed. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients had significantly higher blood PTH levels than patients without treatment. Moreover, NNRTI treatment puts patients at risk of elevated PTH levels (>6.5 pmol/liter). Linear regression analysis showed that vitamin D status did not affect CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART. In conclusion, 29% of the HIV-1-infected patients had vitamin D deficiency, with skin color as an independent risk factor. NNRTI treatment may add more risk for vitamin D deficiency. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients showed higher PTH levels and might therefore be at risk of bone problems. Evaluation of 25(OH)D(3) and PTH levels, especially in NNRTI-treated and dark skinned HIV-1-infected patients, is necessary to detect and treat vitamin D deficiency early."

Once considered a death sentence, HIV infection is now fairly well controlled with combination antiretroviral treatments, almost all of which were first tested for efficacy and safety in nonhuman primates or other laboratory animals. Research in NHP has led to ""dogma changing"" discoveries in immunology, infectious disease, and even our own genetics. We now know that many of our genes are retroviral remnants, or developed in response to archaic HIV-like retroviral infections. Early studies involving blood from HIV patients and in experiments in cultured tissues contributed to confusion regarding the cause of AIDS and impeded progress in the development of effective interventions. Research on the many retroviruses of different NHP species have broadened our understanding of human immunology and perhaps even our origins and evolution as a species. In combination with recent advances in molecular biology and computational analytics, research in NHPs has unique potential for discoveries that will directly lead to new cures for old human and animal diseases, including HIV/AIDS."
2981,0.001,1.0000,"In the context of the optimism around antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prevention of HIV/AIDS, addressing the barriers to long-term ART adherence is critical. This is particularly important given the tendency to individualise or use a blame discourse when exploring why HIV-infected patients ""fail"" to adequately adhere to ART, and not sufficiently exploring contextual reasons for poor adherence that may require varying solutions. This study took place at three clinics and one hospital in Khayelitsha, South Africa, to document the contextual factors that challenged ART adherence in this community. Interviews were conducted with 20 HIV-infected patients who had defaulted on their ART and were subsequently admitted to Khayelitsha hospital for clinical complications, and 9 ART service providers including doctors, nurses and HIV counsellors. Interviews assessed the reasons patients defaulted on ART and explored ways this could be prevented. Data from both groups were analysed collectively using thematic analysis. While the interviews revealed a landscape of environmental risks threatening adherence to ART, all patients managed to overcome the identified barriers at some point in their treatment phase, indicating the fluidity of patients' needs and decision making. Patients reported that distrustful relationships with service providers could inhibit their understanding of ART and/or interrupt their follow-up at clinics. Patients described their rationale and agency underlying non-adherence, such as testing their bodies' physical limits without ART medication. The study speaks to the need to appreciate contextual social and structural barriers related to ART adherence, and how these are negotiated differently by specific sub-groups, to support an appropriate response. It is imperative to not solely emphasise loss to follow-up but also assess patients' subjective trajectory of their ART journey, decision making and agency with adhering to ART, their relations with healthcare workers, and how these dynamics are intertwined with broader constraints in health systems."

Vaccines are critical components for protecting people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The purpose of study was to analyze the vaccination status of PLWHA in outpatient care in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil. Cross-sectional study performed from June 2014 to June 2015. The screening was done with patients in antiretroviral therapy, 420 patients underwent screening, but only 99 met the inclusion criteria. Data were collected for interviews using forms to characterize sociodemographic, clinical and vaccination situations. Only 14 patients had complete vaccination schedules. The most used vaccines were hepatitis B, influenza vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal. There was no difference between men and women regarding the proportion of PLWHA with full vaccination schedule or between sex, skin color, marital status, sexual orientation, religion or occupational status. There was no difference between having or not having a complete vaccination schedule and age, years of education, family income or number of hospitalizations. CD4+ T-cells count of patients with incomplete immunization was lower than patients with complete immunization. Health education strategies can be done individually or in groups to explain the importance of vaccination and to remind about doses to be administered. Most patients did not have proper adherence to vaccination schedules, especially due to lack of guidance. Results implied that education in health is important for vaccination adhesion, knowledge of adverse events and continuation of schemes. "
1339,0.001,1.0000,"Human CD4(+) T cells are major targets for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Resting T cells are resistant to HIV infection unless activated through the T-cell receptor (TCR) or by cytokine signals. How T-cell signaling promotes susceptibility of T cells to HIV infection remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the VacA toxin produced by Helicobacter pylori can inhibit HIV infection of primary T cells, stimulated through the TCR or by cytokines alone. This activity of VacA was dependent on its ability to form membrane channels. VacA suppressed HIV infection of T cells at a stage after viral entry, post-reverse transcription and pre-two-long-terminal-repeat circle formation, similar to the cytokine signaling inhibitor rapamycin. Mechanistically, neither VacA nor rapamycin inhibited the activation of cytokine signal transduction components (STAT5, p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase, or p38), but both blocked activation of key regulatory proteins required for G(1) cell cycle transition. In contrast to rapamycin, VacA did not suppress phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase but caused mitochondrial depolarization and ATP depletion within primary T cells. These results suggest that VacA inhibits T-cell activation and HIV infection via a novel mechanism. Identifying the host cell targets of VacA could be useful for elucidating the HIV life cycle within primary T cells."
3213,0.001,1.0000,"A small number of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) remain clinically and immunologically healthy for more than a decade after infection. Recent reports suggest that these individuals may be infected with an attenuated strain of HIV-1; however, a common genetic basis for viral attenuation has not been found in all cases. In the present study, we examined the functional properties of the HIV-1 env genes from six long-term survivors. env clones were generated by PCR amplification of proviral env sequences, followed by cloning of the amplified regions into expression vectors. Eight to ten clones from each subject were screened by transient transfection for expression of the envelope precursor glycoprotein, gp160. Those clones expressing gp160 were then cotransfected with an HIV-1 luciferase reporter vector, pNL4-3Env(-)LUC(+) and evaluated for their ability to mediate infection of phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in single-cycle infectivity assays. Clones expressing gp160 were identified for all six long-term survivors, indicating the presence of proviral env genes with intact open reading frames. For two subjects, D and DH, the encoded envelope glycoproteins yielded high levels of luciferase activity when pseudotyped onto HIV-1 virions and tested in single-cycle infectivity assays. In contrast, envelope glycoproteins cloned from four other long-term survivors were poorly processed and failed to mediate infection. Sequencing of the gp120/41 cleavage site and conserved gp41 cysteine residues of these clones did not reveal any obvious mutations to explain the functional defects. The functional activity of env clones from long-term survivors D and DH was comparable to that seen with several primary HIV-1 env genes cloned from individuals with disease progression and AIDS. These results suggest that the long-term survival of subjects D and DH is not associated with overt functional defects in env; however, functional abnormalities in env may contribute to maintaining a long-term asymptomatic state in the other four cases we studied."
5156,0.001,1.0000,"To evaluate the immunogenicity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p55(gag) virus-like particles (VLPs) released by budding from yeast spheroplasts, we have analyzed the effects of yeast VLPs on monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). Yeast VLPs were efficiently incorporated into DCs via both macropinocytosis and endocytosis mediated by mannose-recognizing receptors, but not the mannose receptor. The uptake of yeast VLPs induced DC maturation and enhanced cytokine production, notably, interleukin-12 p70. We showed that yeast membrane components may contribute to DC maturation partly through Toll-like receptor 2 signaling. Thus, Gag particles encapsulated by yeast membrane may have an advantage in stimulating Gag-specific immune responses. We found that yeast VLPs, but not the control yeast membrane fraction, were able to activate both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells of HIV-infected individuals. We tested the effect of cross-presentation of VLP by DCs in two subjects recruited into a long-term nonprogressor-slow progressor cohort. When yeast VLP-loaded DCs of these patients were cocultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells for 7 days, approximately one-third of the Gag-specific CD8(+) T cells were activated and became perforin positive. However, some of the Gag-specific CD8(+) T cells appeared to be lost during in vitro culture, especially in a patient with a high virus load. Our results suggest that DCs loaded with yeast VLPs can activate Gag-specific memory CD8(+) T cells to become effector cells in chronically HIV-infected individuals, but there still remain unresponsive Gag-specific T-cell populations in these patients."

However, prolonged lamivudine therapy can produce resistance to the drug. Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) has demonstrated efficacy in patients with lamivudine resistance, but there is limited clinical experience in patients with either renal transplants or severe renal insufficiency. A 47-year-old man with asymptomatic HBV infection underwent renal transplantation in November 1995. In September 2000 lamivudine therapy was initiated to treat HBV reactivation. The outcome was good, with negative HBV DNA levels. Two years later, significant viral replication developed again. At that time the patient already had advanced renal insufficiency due to chronic graft nephropathy. The transaminase levels were increased, and the HBV DNA reached greater than 200,000 copies/mL by polymerase chain reaction, with development of ascites and cirrhosis. The patient was started on ADV 10 mg every 72 hours (dose adjusted to renal function). There was rapid normalization of hepatic enzymes and progressive decline of the viral load. HBV DNA became negative after 6 months of ADV treatment. The renal function has since remained stable. This case suggests that ADV can be safe and effective in the treatment of renal transplant patients with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B, even in the presence of advanced renal insufficiency."

A matched, case-control study was performed to examine the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and azole use on the incidence of invasive cryptococcal disease in HIV-infected patients. The study was performed at a metropolitan hospital with a large indigent population and an incidence of seven cases of cryptococcal disease per 1000 persons with AIDS. Bivariate analysis, matched on CD4 count, revealed that both HAART use [odds ratio (OR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.99] and azole use (OR 0.14; 95% CI 0.06-0.34) had a protective effect. Conditional logistic regression stratified on CD4 lymphocyte count revealed a protective role for azole use (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.06-0.40) but not for HAART use (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.18-1.26). Of note, the prevalence of HAART use was low in both cases and controls, with only 12% of cases and 23% of controls on HAART. The results of this study support previous evidence that azole use prevents invasive cryptococcal disease. Although current guidelines for the prophylaxis of opportunistic infections do not suggest routine prophylaxis for cryptococcal infection, this issue should be reconsidered, especially in populations that have a low prevalence of HAART use."

These bacteria were identified as Rhodococcus erythropolis. The disseminated infection was restricted to the skin and showed a slow response to long-term therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. No relapse has been observed more than 6 months after discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. The etiology of a concomitant polyarthritis remains unknown; a relationship with the rhodococcus infection is possible as the arthritis responded well to the antibiotic therapy and did not reactivate after discontinuation of antibiotics. Due to the difficult isolation technic, this pathogen may be overlooked in routine diagnostic procedures. The implications in clinical practice are discussed."
3023,0.001,1.0000,"We report a patient with Japanese minor β thalassemia and HIV-1 infection. The patient showed prolonged anemia, which was originally attributed to chronic parvovirus B19 infection. Twelve years later, the patient presented with exacerbation of microcytic anemia following cessation of anti-retroviral therapy; the exacerbation resolved when anti-retroviral therapy was resumed. Sequencing of the β globin gene revealed heterozygosity for a four-nucleotides deletion at codon 41/42 and minor β thalassemia was confirmed. Because HIV-1-infected patients frequently show anemia due to nutritional deficiencies, opportunistic infections, AIDS-related malignancies, drug treatment and a direct effect of HIV-1 on the bone marrow, it is likely to overlook other causes of anemia. Thalassemia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of anemia even in HIV-1 infected patients, when microcytic anemia without iron deficiency is observed. Our case suggested that active HIV infection may have worsened β thalassemia, and early introduction of anti-retroviral therapy is beneficial for the recovery of anemia."
9842,0.001,1.0000,"The spectrum of neurological complications associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is broad. The most frequent etiologies include primary diseases (caused by HIV itself) or secondary diseases (opportunistic infections or neoplasms). Despite these conditions, HIV-infected patients are susceptible to other infections observed in patients without HIV infection. Here we report a rare case of a brain abscess caused by Staphylococcus aureus in an HIV-infected patient. After drainage of the abscess and treatment with oxacilin, the patient had a favorable outcome. This case reinforces the importance of a timely neurosurgical procedure that supported adequate management of an unusual cause of expansive brain lesions in HIV-1 infected patients. "
9899,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated fat-redistribution syndrome is still a subject of controversy. There is, as yet, little agreement on the definition, etiology, and prevalence of the syndrome. Many studies have examined medication or disease-related factors. Fewer studies have examined patient-related factors. Illicit drug use is an important risk factor for HIV infection, yet the role of drug use in fat distribution has not been well described. We examined fat distribution, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, in relation to drug use, smoking, and alcohol use in Hispanic patients with HIV infection and control group of HIV-negative drug users. Our results suggest that neither drug use nor alcohol consumption are predictors of fat distribution. However, among men, smoking was independently associated with less total fat, less trunk fat, and more appendicular fat. The role of patient-specific factors in the etiology of HIV-associated fat-redistribution syndrome warrants further investigation."
468,0.001,1.0000,"To characterize, over time, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) virus-load change in clinically stable patients, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 RNA levels were measured in serial CSF samples and in plasma samples obtained, during periods of 20 days-6 years, from 17 HIV-infected individuals not receiving antiretroviral treatment. Longitudinal trends were analyzed by linear regression and restricted maximum-likelihood techniques. CSF HIV-1 RNA levels varied within a restricted range (+/-0.5 log(10) copies/mL) around each subject-specific mean. Although 16 of the 17 subjects had CSF slopes not significantly different from zero, slopes that were more positive were associated with lower CD4 counts. In an individual patient, a CSF virus-load change >0.5 log(10) copies/mL may be clinically significant. Furthermore, our data suggest that, if the CSF virus load reflects the size of the reservoir of infected cells in the central nervous system, this reservoir may increase in those individuals with advanced immunosuppression but is stable, over several years, in patients without AIDS."
5077,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global problem and the world has 350 million carriers of chronic hepatitis B. Over 50 % of these have acquired their infection vertically from their mothers (mother-to-child transmission [MTCT]). Majority (>90 %) of vertically-acquired infection results into chronic infection, due to induction of an immune-tolerant state. Hence, management of chronic HBV during pregnancy and strategies to prevent MTCT would go a long way in global control of HBV infection and the morbidity and mortality associated with it. However, chronic HBV infection in pregnancy presents a unique challenge, because of existence of a complex relationship between the physiological changes of pregnancy and the pathophysiological response of body to HBV. This relationship may lead to a varied presentation of the patient to the doctor depending on the period of her pregnancy and stage of her liver disease. Each of these modes of presentation raises issues that need to be addressed for successful maternal and fetal outcome, including prevention of MTCT of HBV. This review will try to give a practical approach in addressing these issues."
7658,0.001,1.0000,"HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are global health concerns, and coinfection with these viruses is common due to shared routes of transmission. Mortality rates from AIDS and HIV-associated opportunistic infections have decreased since the institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy, but the incidence of liver-related mortality in coinfected patients has subsequently risen significantly. This increase in progression of liver disease and its subsequent increased mortality have spurred research into the optimization of evaluation and management of the HIV-HCV coinfected patient."
4018,0.001,1.0000,"Although HAART has resulted in improved health outcomes for most HIV-infected individuals, liver failure has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). In HBV mono-infected individuals, core deletion mutants are associated with more aggressive liver disease. As HIV accelerates HBV liver disease progression, we hypothesized that HIV-HBV co-infected individuals have increased frequency of core mutations including deletions. To test this hypothesis, we have analysed genome-length sequences of HBV DNA from patients both prior to and during antiviral therapy."
7191,0.001,1.0000,"In our HIV outpatient centre where over 1,200 patients are followed, maraviroc as an entry inhibitor was introduced in 2010. We aimed to assess the background, the therapeutic challenges and the prospective monitoring of all patients treated with a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including maraviroc. Sixty-six patients started a maraviroc-containing cART with a history of HIV infection lasting 13.9±10.7 years. This interim analysis presents patients who had at least 12 (mean 16.9±12.8) months of follow-up. One to 17 previous cART changes prompted the introduction of maraviroc in rescue regimens in the great majority of patients considered (53 of 66); in 13 cases, maraviroc was given to patients with advanced HIV disease and no immune recovery after 2-3 years of a virologically-effective cART. The most frequent companion antiretroviral agents were: darunavir/ritonavir (51 cases), raltegravir (49 subjects), and etravirine (36 cases). The most common underlying conditions were: AIDS (41 cases), liver cirrhosis (21), AIDS-related or other malignancies (20 cases), major cardiovascular events (18 cases), osteonecrosis and haemodialysis-treated kidney failure (3 cases each). A chronic HCV and HBV hepatitis were of concern in 25 and 13 patients. The addition of maraviroc added favourably to clinical-laboratory markers of HIV disease progression, and those of comorbid conditions. HIV viraemia became (or remained) undetectable in 55 patients of 66 (83.3%). An improvement in CD4+ count was observed in all 66 patients, based on a mean 24.9±19.2% increase versus baseline, paralleled by an improvement in mean absolute CD4+ count of 134.7±121.1 cells/μL. A tendency towards an increased mean and peak CD4+ count was observed in the subgroup receiving a maraviroc-raltegravir-based cART. As no clinical-laboratory adverse events attributable to maraviroc occurred, nobody discontinued the study drug. Only mild-transient gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue and anorexia, were reported during maraviroc administration, but their relationship with the study drug was difficult to assess because of the multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. Our preliminary experience with maraviroc, even considering the limits of the proportionally reduced sample, the patients' salvage stage of advanced disease and the related-unrelated morbidities, underlines its excellent efficacy and safety profile."
1105,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 2 infection is associated with a better clinical outcome, slower rates of CD4 T cell decline, and lower viremia than is HIV-1. This study compares HIV-1 and HIV-2 in regard to the percentages of interleukin (IL)-2-, interferon (IFN)-gamma-, and IL-4-producing cells at the single-cell level, as determined by flow cytometry. At a given degree of CD4 T cell depletion, the frequency of T cells able to produce IL-2 is better preserved in HIV-2 than in HIV-1 infection, particularly within the CD4 T cell subset. As described for HIV-1 immunodeficiency, HIV-2-positive patients exhibit a marked expansion of terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells (CD28(-)CD27(-)IFN-gamma(+)). However, the proportion of CD8 T cells able to simultaneously produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma is higher in HIV-2 disease. Considering the central role of IL-2 as a lymphocyte proliferative and survival factor, these findings provide a possible immunologic basis for the distinct course of HIV-2 immunodeficiency."
167,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of our study was to evaluate the seasonal variations and whether short-term exposure to environmental risk factors, such as climate and air pollution, is associated with PTB-related hospital admissions in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients in Spain during the era of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). A retrospective study was carried out using data from the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) and the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) of Spain. The primary outcome variable was hospital admissions with PTB diagnosis. The environmental risk factors evaluated were season, temperature, humidity, NO2, SO2, O3, PM10, and CO. Overall, HIV-infected patients had a lower frequency of PTB-related hospital admissions in summer (22.8%) and autumn (22.4%), but higher values in winter (26.6%) and spring (28.2%). Using a Bayesian temporal model, PTB-related hospital admissions were less frequent in summer-autumn and more abundant in winter-spring during the first years of follow-up. During the later years of follow-up, the seasonal trends continued resulting in the lowest values in autumn and the highest in spring. When considering short-term exposure to environmental risk factors, lower temperatures at 1 week (odds ratio (OR) = 1.03; p = 0.008), 1.5 weeks (OR = 1.03; p<0.001), 2 weeks (OR = 1.04; p<0.001), and 3 weeks (OR = 1.03; p<0.001) prior to PTB admission. In addition, higher concentration of NO2 at the time of admission were significantly associated with higher likelihoods of PTB-related hospital admission in HIV-infected patients when 1.5 weeks (OR = 1.1; p = 0.044) and 2 weeks (OR = 1.21; p<0.001) were used as controls. Finally, higher concentration of SO2 at 1.5 weeks prior to PTB admission was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of PTB-related hospital admissions (OR = 0.92; p = 0.029). In conclusion, our data suggest an apparent seasonal variation in hospital admissions of HIV-infected patients with a PTB diagnosis (summer/autumn vs. winter/spring), as well as a link to short-term exposure to environmental risk factors, such as temperature and ambient NO2 and SO2."
3989,0.001,1.0000,"This study was conducted to better understand the prognostic factors influencing the disease progression and mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in a high-middle-income country. This registry-based retrospective cohort study was conducted in Tehran from April 2004 to March 2014. We enrolled 2473 HIV-infected patients who had a medical record in Behavioral Diseases Counseling Centers. The outcomes of interest were the estimation of time: (1) from HIV diagnosis to AIDS progression and (2) from AIDS to AIDS-related death. The 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year probability of disease progression from HIV diagnosis to AIDS was 45.0%, 69.9%, and 90.4%, and that of AIDS-related death was 17.2%, 30.3%, and 39.2%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that AIDS progression was significantly associated with male sex (P = 0.022), an increase in age (P = 0.001), low educational levels (P = 0.001), and a decreased level of CD4 cell count (P = 0.001). Furthermore, the AIDS-related mortality was significantly associated with male sex (P = 0.010), tuberculosis coinfection (P = 0.001), and antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.001). The results of this study indicated that progression to AIDS and AIDS-related death is affected by several modifiable and non-modifiable predictors. We indicated that a substantial proportion of the HIV-positive people were unaware of their status and were diagnosed very late. This hidden source of HIV infection had the opportunity to transmit the infection to other people. "
9248,0.001,1.0000,"With the antigen expressed in yeast from a cDNA clone encoding a non-structural region of newly discovered hepatitic C virus (HCV) genome, the prevalence of HCV antibody in people in Thailand was investigated. Antibody was detected in 2.6% of healthy blood donors and in 2.8% of healthy pregnant women. These prevalence rates were higher than those reported previously from Japan, USA and European countries. Among community-acquired, sporadic cases of acute and chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis, however, only 5.7% and 15.4% were shown to possess the antibody, respectively. Among hepatocellular carcinoma patients who were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen in the sera, 11.1% had antibody to HCV. These seroepidemiological data suggest that HCV plays an important role as an etiological agent in Thailand; however, other agents must also be involved in etiologic agents of viral hepatitis and chronic liver disease."
365,0.001,1.0000,"Previous studies of risk factors for hepatitis B virus infection among hospital employees have been based on surveys in single institutions or have been analyzed with univariate techniques. From November 1980 through August 1981, the authors performed a multi-institutional seroepidemiologic survey of hospital employees screened for entrance into a hepatitis B vaccine trial who represented groups at high risk for hepatitis B infection. Using a logistic regression model for the analysis of risk factors, the investigators determined the relative odds and 95% confidence intervals for risk of hepatitis B infection to be as follows: race (nonwhite/white: 3.4; 2.4-4.8) (p less than 0.001); history of acute viral hepatitis of an unspecified type (3.6; 2.2-5.9) (p less than 0.001); and employment at hospitals 1 through 5 as compared with hospital 6 (1.8; 1.1-2.9) (p = 0.015). In addition, certain job categories and the duration of employment within some of these categories were associated with increasing risk for hepatitis B infection over time. Laboratory workers (1.4; 1.2-1.7), surgical staff (1.2; 1.1-1.4), and medical staff (1.3; 1.1-1.5) had significant (p less than 0.05) increased risk of prior infection with longer duration of employment. Such time-job interaction was not demonstrable for nursing staff, anesthesiology staff, dental personnel, pathology staff, or ancillary personnel. The logistic regression model also shows that the highest gradient of risk for laboratory workers, surgeons, and medical staff occurs during the first five years of employment. An effective preventive strategy, such as the use of hepatitis B vaccine, should be targeted for these groups at the time of initial employment."
8466,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is occasionally developed in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Old age, male gender, lifetime quantity of alcohol, and presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are risk factors for HCC in alcoholic cirrhosis. In this study, we investigated whether anti-hepatitis B core (HBc) positivity or occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a risk factor for HCC in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Between January 2006 and August 2008, a total of 72 cirrhotic male patients with an initial diagnosis of HCC, hospitalized in three major hospitals in the Incheon area, were enrolled as cases. Another 72 cirrhotic male patients without HCC, who matched the cases by age (±3 years), were enrolled as controls. All cases and controls were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HCV, but had history of chronic alcohol intake over 80 g per day. The clinical characteristics including presence of anti-HBc or serum HBV DNA (identified by nested polymerase chain reaction) were investigated. The mean age of both the cases and controls was 62 ± 10 years. The basal laboratory data, Child-Pugh scores, total lifetime alcohol intake (1459 ± 1364 versus 1641 ± 1045 kg), and detection rates of serum HBV DNA [31.7% (20/63) versus 29.9% (20/67)] of the cases and controls were not significantly different. However, the anti-HBc positivity rate was higher among the cases [86.1% (62/72)] than in the controls [66.7% (48/72); p=0.005] and was the only significant risk factor for HCC (odds ratio; 3.1, 95% confidence interval; 1.354-7.098, p=0.007). Anti-HBc positivity was identified as a risk factor for the development of HCC in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis."
1851,0.001,1.0000,"There are very few data on the molecular biology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in dialysis patients. 101 patients undergoing dialysis treatment in 4 units in the Lombardy, northern Italy, were analyzed by RT-PCR for HCV viremia, by line probe assay technology for HCV genotyping and by a serological analysis for detecting type-specific antibodies. 61 of 101 (60%) patients showed detectable HCV RNA in serum; HCV genotype 2a was dominant (30/53 = 57%), followed by HCV genotype 1b (20/53 = 37%). There was no relationship between HCV genotyping and the clinical or demographic features of the patients. The antibody response toward the c33-c, c100-3, and 5-1-1 antigens was more frequent in HCV genotype 1b compared with genotype 2a (p = 0.046, p = 0.001 and p = 0.0001, respectively). The antibody levels to NS-3 and NS-4 HCV proteins were significantly higher in patients with-HCV genotype 1b in comparison with HCV 2a-infected individuals (p = 0.0001). There was a high level (82%) of agreement between HCV genotyping by RT-PCR and the assessment of type-specific antibodies by serological analysis; further, it was possible to detect type-specific antibodies in 6 of 22 (27%) patients in whom PCR amplification was unsuccessful. In conclusion, HCV subtype 2a was dominant in our population of HCV-infected dialysis patients, dialysis patients infected by different genotypes showed similar demographic and clinical characteristics, the antibody response toward the NS-3- and NS-4-related antigen of HCV was genotype dependent. There was a high level of agreement between HCV genotyping by RT-PCR and the detection of type-specific antibodies by serological analysis. As significant biological differences may exist among HCV strains, the assessment of HCV types may be very useful in the routine clinical activity of nephrologists in dialysis units."
1792,0.001,1.0000,"Interactions between combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and lung cancer treatment are emerging clinical concerns. Among the reasons for that, one can observe the longer survival of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients since introduction of CART and the epidemiologic rising of lung cancer, mainly adenocarcinomas, in this population. In addition, the higher relative risk of lung cancer in HIV-infected patients compared with general population has been recently demonstrated. Patients' demography and disease characteristics differ from the general lung cancer population, although most cases occur in patients with a smoking history: HIV-infected subjects are generally younger and diagnosis frequently made at locally advanced or metastatic stages. The choice of cytotoxic chemotherapy and antiretroviral therapy is essential in the context of lung cancer (1) to minimize potential interactions and life-threatening toxicities particularly through cytochrome P450 interaction, (2) to implement adequate prevention of foreseeable toxicity, and (3) to fully reinforce antineoplastic and antiretroviral efficacy. Pharmacokinetics data and clinical cases pinpoint to potential life-threatening interactions between protease inhibitors/ritonavir and taxanes, vinca alkaloids, as well as the anilinoquinazolines erlotinib and gefitinib and irinotecan. Optimal choice of chemotherapy and CART in HIV-infected patients with lung cancer is an individualized multidisciplinary decision, involving clinical and antiretroviral history, and predicting potential adverse events and interactions."
6604,0.001,1.0000,"Resistance to HIV-1 infection in Europeans is associated with a mutation in the gene that codes for the CCR5 protein that is present in Th2 cells and serves as a coreceptor for HIV-1 R5 strain. A deletion of 32 amino acids from the cytokine receptor prevents infection. This mutation prevails in Europeans and is absent in Africans. However, duplication of a gene that codes for a chemokine that binds to the CCR5 was discovered in Africans (mean gene copy 6 while in non-Africans the mean gene copy is 3). Higher expression of these genes protects T cells against HIV-1 infection in vitro. It should be noted that resistance to HIV-1 R5 variant does not protect against HIV-1 R4 variant. It was reported that a minority of highly HIV-1 exposed African professional sex workers (APSW) were resistant to the virus infection during a 10 years period. Recently, the analysis of the cytokines in the serum of the persistently infected seronegative women revealed that the latter hypo-expresses the cytokine IL-4. Since the molecular events during HIV-1 infection are associated with a marked increase in the levels of IL-4 and IgE in the sera of the infected individuals, it suggests that AIDS is an allergy. Thus, a very low level of IL-4 production may abrogate the virus infection. Studies on the human IL-4 gene revealed that together with the IL-4 mRNA a spliced variant with a deletion of exon 2 is synthesized. The latter is a natural antagonist of IL-4 and when expressed in an individual at a level higher than IL-4, the person will resist a microbial infection (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or asthma. The present hypothesis suggests that the HIV-1 resistant APSWs produce more IL-4 delta 2 molecules than IL-4 molecules. The binding of IL-4 delta 2 to IL-4 receptors on T and B cells prevents their functions and the infection by HIV-1. The implications of these studies are that treatment of HIV-1 infected people with drugs that will block the IL-4 receptors will stop HIV-1 infections and the determination of the levels of IL-4 and IL-4 delta 2 in the sera of HIV-1+ patients will enable to identify the individuals that have a natural resistance to HIV-l/AIDS and those who need treatments."
5889,0.001,1.0000,"Levels of virus in the plasma are closely related to the pathogenicity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-2 is much less pathogenic than HIV-1, and infection with HIV-2 leads to significantly lower plasma viral load. To identify the source of this difference, we measured both viral RNA and proviral DNA in matched samples from 34 HIV-2-infected individuals. Nearly half had undetectable viral RNA loads (<100 copies/ml), but levels of proviral DNA were relatively high and confirmed that quantities of provirus in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection were similar. Overall, HIV-2 proviral DNA load did not correlate with viral RNA load, and higher viral RNA load was associated with increased production of plasma virus from the proviral template. These results suggest that low viral load in HIV-2 infection is due to decreased rates of viral production, rather than differences in target cell infectivity."
2607,0.001,1.0000,"The study examined the relationship between coping and psychosocial variables (psychological stress symptoms, locus of control, emotional repression, and social support) among 108 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The authors administered several tests, including one that measures fighting spirit and degree of hopelessness, to assess each patient's individual coping style. The patients who were adjusting well to their HIV-positive status tended to have a higher level of fighting spirit and lower degree of hopelessness than those patients who were not adjusting well to their HIV-positive status. A coping style based on incapacity to face and confront HIV infection was associated with symptoms of psychological stress, repression of anger, external locus of control, and low social support in the latter group. These patients showed symptoms indicating maladjustment to HIV infection (43% of the sample) and differed from the ""noncases"" (the well-adjusted patients) in that the former group reported inadequate coping responses (lower fighting spirit and higher hopelessness, fatalistic attitude, and anxious preoccupation) and poorer social support, and had a greater tendency to repress anger and express sadness. The data support the hypothesis that coping with HIV infection is a complex phenomenon involving multiple and interacting variables. Interventions aimed at improving the coping style for many HIV patients are needed."
6571,0.001,1.0000,"The highly active antiretroviral therapy reduces HIV-1 RNA in plasma to undetectable levels. However, the virus continues to persist in the long-lived resting CD4(+) T cells, macrophages and astrocytes which form a viral reservoir in infected individuals. Reactivation of viral transcription is critical since the host immune response in combination with antiretroviral therapy may eradicate the virus. Using the chronically HIV-1 infected T lymphoblastoid and monocytic cell lines, primary quiescent CD4(+) T cells and humanized mice infected with dual-tropic HIV-1 89.6, we examined the effect of various X-ray irradiation (IR) doses (used for HIV-related lymphoma treatment and lower doses) on HIV-1 transcription and viability of infected cells. Treatment of both T cells and monocytes with IR, a well-defined stress signal, led to increase of HIV-1 transcription, as evidenced by the presence of RNA polymerase II and reduction of HDAC1 and methyl transferase SUV39H1 on the HIV-1 promoter. This correlated with the increased GFP signal and elevated level of intracellular HIV-1 RNA in the IR-treated quiescent CD4(+) T cells infected with GFP-encoding HIV-1. Exposition of latently HIV-1infected monocytes treated with PKC agonist bryostatin 1 to IR enhanced transcription activation effect of this latency-reversing agent. Increased HIV-1 replication after IR correlated with higher cell death: the level of phosphorylated Ser46 in p53, responsible for apoptosis induction, was markedly higher in the HIV-1 infected cells following IR treatment. Exposure of HIV-1 infected humanized mice with undetectable viral RNA level to IR resulted in a significant increase of HIV-1 RNA in plasma, lung and brain tissues. Collectively, these data point to the use of low to moderate dose of IR alone or in combination with HIV-1 transcription activators as a potential application for the ""Shock and Kill"" strategy for latently HIV-1 infected cells.

671,0.001,1.0000,"To evaluate whether frank or subtle disorders of adrenal steroidogenesis exist in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children, the adrenal steroid response to an iv bolus of ACTH-(1-24) (0.25 mg Cortrosyn) was determined. Ten children (six males and four females, aged 7 months to 7.5 yr) were studied. Five underwent repeat testing 3-5 months after initial assessment. Nine patients were classified as P2 or symptomatic according to the Center for Disease Control criteria for HIV infection in children. Eight had failure to thrive, six had opportunistic infections and neurological deficits, and two were receiving ketoconazole at the time of ACTH testing. Only one patient had a neonatally acquired transfusion-related HIV infection. Three of the children died 2-5 months after ACTH testing. All patients had normal or slightly elevated baseline and stimulated cortisol levels compared to the control population. The mean post-ACTH cortisol level was significantly higher than the mean post-ACTH level in the control population. No patient demonstrated an impaired aldosterone response to ACTH. The basal and ACTH-stimulated dehydroepiandrosterone levels were normal. Although individual deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone levels were variable, the mean stimulated deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone levels in the patients were suggestive of a selective defect of the 17-desoxy pathway in the adrenal fasciculata. No changes were noted in the patients' cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and aldosterone responses on repeat ACTH testing. In HIV-infected children we have demonstrated that cortisol and aldosterone synthesis is intact. Thus, the chronic debilitation observed cannot be explained on the basis of adrenal insufficiency. However, a selective deficiency of 17-desoxysteroid hormone production from the adrenal fasciculata may be present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8026,0.001,1.0000,"Sequential infection with different strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a rarely identified phenomenon with important implications for immunopathogenesis and vaccine development. Here, we identify an individual whose good initial control of viremia was lost in association with reduced containment of a superinfecting strain. Subject 2030 presented with acute symptoms of HIV-1 infection with high viremia and an incomplete seroconversion as shown by Western blotting. A low set point of viremia (approximately 1,000 HIV-1 copies/ml) was initially established without drug therapy, but a new higher set point (approximately 40,000 HIV-1 copies/ml) manifested about 5 months after infection. Drug susceptibility testing demonstrated a multidrug-resistant virus initially but a fully sensitive virus after 5 months, and an analysis of pol genotypes showed that these were two phylogenetically distinct strains of virus (strains A and B). Replication capacity assays suggested that the outgrowth of strain B was not due to higher fitness conferred by pol, and env sequences indicated that the two strains had the same R5 coreceptor phenotype. Delineation of CD8+-T-lymphocyte responses against HIV-1 showed a striking pattern of decay of the initial cellular immune responses after superinfection, followed by some adaptation of targeting to new epitopes. An examination of targeted sequences suggested that differences in the recognized epitopes contributed to the poor immune containment of strain B. In conclusion, the rapid overgrowth of a superinfecting strain of HIV-1 of the same subtype raises major concerns for effective vaccine development."
7983,0.001,1.0000,"Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells are involved in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. However, their role in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is not fully understood, especially in human species. In this study, 35 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 25 inactive carriers (IC) and 36 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled and the proportions of circulating iNKT cells in fresh isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were detected by flow cytometry. A longitudinal analysis was also conducted in 19 CHB patients who received antiviral therapy with telbivudine. Thereafter, the immune functions of iNKT cells were evaluated by cytokine secretion and a two-chamber technique. The median frequency of circulating iNKT cells in CHB patients (0.13%) was lower than that in HC (0.24%, P = 0.01) and IC (0.19%, P = 0.02), and increased significantly during antiviral therapy with telbivudine (P = 0.0176). The expressions of CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CCR6 were dramatically higher on iNKT cells (82.83%±9.87%, 67.67%±16.83% respectively) than on conventional T cells (30.5%±5.65%, 14.02%±5.92%, both P<0.001) in CHB patients. Furthermore, iNKT cells could migrate toward the CC chemokine ligand 5. Patients with a high ratio (≥1.0) of CD4-/CD4+ iNKT cells at baseline had a higher rate (58.33%) of HBeAg seroconversion than those with a low ratio (<1.0, 0%, P = 0.0174). In conclusion, there is a low frequency of peripheral iNKT cells in CHB patients, which increases to normal levels with viral control. The ratio of CD4-/CD4+ iNKT cells at baseline may be a useful predictor for HBeAg seroconversion in CHB patients on telbivudine therapy."
492,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in patients with positive hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) has been reported in some cases of allogenic bone marrow transplantation, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and organ transplantation. However, to our knowledge, no reports have been made on the frequency and risk factors involved in HBV reactivation after autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT). Forty seven patients who underwent APBSCT were retrospectively analyzed. Three patients who were HBsAb positive before APBSCT contracted post-transplant HBV acute hepatitis. All 3 patients had multiple myeloma. HBV DNA could not be demonstrated in preserved samples of transfused blood. Therefore, we speculated that reactivation of latent HBV had occurred. The 3 patients with HBV hepatitis had relatively lower titers of pre-transplant HBsAb, and the total dose of steroids they received after APBSCT was significantly higher than for other patients who did not experience post-transplant HBV reactivation. There were no significant differences in pre-transplant hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) titer or total post-transplant blood transfusion volume. Our study suggested that immunocompromised states, especially those induced by high-dose steroid therapy, may allow the reactivation of HBV after APBSCT, even in patients who had HBsAb before APBSCT."
4392,0.001,1.0000,"Rituximab causes hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-seronegative patients with CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (CD20 NHL), especially for those seropositive to the antibody of core antigen (anti-HBc). Clinical hepatitis usually develops after reverse seroconversion of HBsAg (HBV-RS), indicated by the reappearance of HBsAg in serum. Because of the relatively high prevalence of anti-HBc seropositivity in unvaccinated HBsAg-seronegative adults in an HBV hyperendemic area, we aimed to investigate additional factors influencing the development of rituximab-associated HBV-RS.Between January 2000 and December 2010, unvaccinated HBsAg-seronegative adults with CD20 NHL who had received rituximab-containing therapy but not anti-HBV agents were enrolled. Patients with and without HBV-RS were compared in terms of clinical factors and treatments including the number of cycles of rituximab therapy, and transplantation. Competing risk regression was used to identify the factors associated with HBV-RS.For the 482 patients enrolled, the serological status of anti-HBc was available in 75.9%, with a seropositivity rate of 86.6%. At the last follow-up, a total of 33 (6.85%) patients had HBV-RS, with 95.8% anti-HBc seropositive, 78.9% anti-HBs seropositive, and none anti-HCV seropositive. HBV-RS patients have received more cycles (≥6) and prolonged durations of rituximab therapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The overall survival was not different between patients with and those without HBV-RS. At the time of HBV-RS, a total of 25 (78.1%) patients had hepatitis flare, especially when HBV-RS appeared during/after induction therapy (100%, 10 of 10). Three (9.1%) patients had fulminant hepatitis, resulting in death in 1 (3%) patient. A higher rituximab cycle intensity was associated with a higher rate of hepatitis flare at the time of HBV-RS. When death in the absence of HBV-RS was considered as the competing risk, the univariate and multivariate regression analyses showed that several factors were independently associated with the development of HBV-RS, including anti-HCV seronegativity, histological subtype of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders, ≥6 cycles of rituximab therapy, and succeeding hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.The findings of our study identify additional factors influencing the development of rituximab-associated HBV-RS in HBsAg-seronegative adults with CD20 NHL.

5068,0.001,1.0000,"HBV infection has been investigated in 47 anti-human HIV positive patients in relation to a similar group of 33 anti-HIV negative patients. Serological HBV markers were found in 87% of anti-HIV positive patients. The difference in markers of viral replication (HBeAg, HBV-DNA) was not statistically significant between the two groups. It has been suggested that HBV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells could be a cofactor implicated in the development of immunodeficiency due to HIV. For this reason we have investigated the presence of HBV-DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by in situ hybridization. Although its detection was more frequent in anti-HIV positive patients than in anti-HIV negative ones (p < 0.05), it was not related to clinical state of immunodeficiency. With regard to serological HBV markers, HBV-DNA was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from antiHBc w/o antiHBs patients. This fact means the virus may persist in this cells after recovery and suggest they could serve as additional reservoirs of HBV. These cells, that contain the HBV genome, could be implicated in the perpetuation, reactivation of the infection and in its transmission."
8803,0.001,1.0000,"We investigated the relationship of infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) to p53 mutation in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) from six countries, including Japan, China, Korea, Vietnam, Spain, and the Unites States. For this purpose, we used formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver tissues obtained from 449 patients with HCC to detect the viral and p53 genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HBV was the most prevalent in Korea (69.1%), China (66.1%), Vietnam (60.5%), and Spain (38.6%). In contrast, HCV was the most prevalent in Japan (59.8%) and in the United States (41.5%). Type C of HBV was the most common genotype (78.6%) encountered in HCC in these countries. Importantly, among 125 intrahepatic HBV DNA-positive patients, 44 (35.2%) were serologically negative for HBsAg (occult hepatitis B). Based on PCR, immunohistochemical, serological, and clinical findings, 4.8% of HCC patients were diagnosed with non-B, non-C. A point mutation at exon 7 of p53 was detected in 20 of the 239 HCC samples examined, including those from 9 Chinese, 5 American, 2 Japanese, 2 Korean, and 2 Spanish patients, respectively. Interestingly, a point mutation with an amino acid substitution at codon 251 (Ile-->Asn) was detected frequently in 11 of 20 (55%) cases. A specific mutation induced by Aflatoxin B1 at codon 249 was seen in two patients, both Chinese. Our results suggest that genotype C of HBV may play an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis in different geographic regions, and that in situ detection of HBV genomes could be important for clarifying the agent(s) of unknown etiology related to HCC."
9050,0.001,1.0000,"The aims of this study were to investigate the efficacy of prolonged entecavir (ETV) therapy in treatment-naive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and to determine whether continuous ETV therapy is feasible to achieve HBeAg seroconversion, particularly in patients with partial virological response (PVR). A total of 142 treatment-naive patients with CHB were enrolled. The mean duration of treatment was 65 (range, 26 to 90) months, and 86 patients (60.6%) were HBeAg positive. PVR was defined as detectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA (>116 copies/ml) at year 1. The cumulative incidence of virological response (VR) increased from 54.9% at year 1 to 98.2% at year 7. HBeAg positivity (odds ratio [OR], 4.146; P = 0.001) and initial alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (OR, 0.997; P = 0.004) were independent risk factors for PVR. Among the 64 patients with PVR, 47 patients (73.4%) achieved VR within 4 years after prolonged ETV therapy without treatment adaptation. Three patients (2.1%) experienced virological breakthrough and HBV variants with genotypic resistance. The cumulative rate of HBeAg seroconversion was significantly higher in the patients with VR than in the patients with PVR (P = 0.018). None of the PVR patients with HBV DNA at ≥5,000 copies/ml at year 1 ever experienced HBeAg seroconversion. Multivariate analysis identified VR at year 1 as the only determinant of HBeAg seroconversion (hazard ratio [HR], 3.009; P = 0.010). In conclusion, although there were patients with PVR, prolonged ETV therapy showed excellent VR, with only 2.1% emergence of viral resistance during a 7-year follow-up. However, to achieve HBeAg seroconversion, drug modification is needed for HBeAg-positive patients with PVR (especially those with HBV DNA at ≥5,000 copies/ml at year 1). "
9456,0.001,1.0000,"Tenofovir alafenamide (tenofovir AF) is a novel oral prodrug of the nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) tenofovir that has several pharmacological advantages over tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF), including increased plasma stability and reduced tenofovir systemic exposure. Tenofovir AF has been coformulated with elvitegravir, cobicistat and emtricitabine as a once-daily, single-tablet regimen (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF; Genvoya(®)) for the treatment of adults and adolescents with HIV-1 infection. With regard to establishing and/or maintaining virological suppression over 48 weeks in randomized, phase III trials, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF was noninferior to elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive adults, and statistically superior (subsequent to established noninferiority) to ongoing treatment with tenofovir DF-containing regimens in ART-experienced adults with virological suppression. In single-arm, phase III trials, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF also provided high rates of virological suppression among ART-naive adolescents and ART-experienced adults with stable renal impairment. In general, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF was well tolerated and associated with more favourable renal and bone parameters, but a less favourable lipid profile, than tenofovir DF-containing regimens. Thus, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF is an alternative single-tablet regimen for adults and adolescents with HIV-1 infection, particularly those with an estimated creatinine clearance of ≥30 to <50 mL/min or an increased risk of tenofovir DF-related bone toxicity.

8033,0.001,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of nevirapine in combination with didanosine and stavudine in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1-infected Chinese patients in routine clinical practice. The study, from April 2003 to May 2005, with follow-up through 24 mo, was conducted at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Second Xiangya Hospital, Central-South University in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. Twenty-seven HIV1-infected patients received didanosine, stavudine, and nevirapine. Information from case notes regarding age, sex, side effects, viral load, naive and memory T cells, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell count at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo was collected and analyzed. Virologic suppression, defined as an HIV RNA concentration of less than 50 copies/mL at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24, was considered the main outcome measure. Of 27 patients, 17 were men with a mean age 33.5 yr. The mean baseline viral load was 5.15 log copies/mL and the mean CD4(+) cell count was 185 cells/dL. Of 27 patients, 3 patients discontinued study medication; treatment was changed, because of side effects, from didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and nevirapine (NVP) to zidovudine, lamivudine, and NVP for 24 patients who had completed 24 mo of treatment with ddI, d4T, and NVP; and viral load suppression was attained in 17 patients (70.8%) at 12 mo, in 14 patients (58.3%) at 18 mo, and in 13 patients (56.6%) at 24 mo. The CD4 T cell count increased by 114 cells/microL (mean, 299 cells/microL) after 12 mo of treatment and by 132 cells/microL (mean, 317 cells/microL) after 24 mo of treatment. Naive T cells and memory cells also increased in number, but at a slower rate. Activated (CD38(+)) CD8(+) T cells were elevated at baseline (67.7%) and declined by month 24 (49.7%), but did not reach normal levels. We conclude that a regimen of NVP with ddI and d4T provided durable suppression of plasma viral load in HIV-infected patients, with significant improvement in the CD4 cell count, and can be well tolerated by patients with HIV-1 infection."

A total of 357 HIV-infected participants (84 STI-HIV co-infection and 273 HIV infections only) were recruited from Jiangsu, China. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the related factors associated with STI-HIV co-infection. Marginal structural models were adopted to estimate the effect of transmission drug resistance (TDR) on STI-HIV co-infection. For all participants, logistic regression analyses revealed that those who diagnosed with HIV-1 for longer duration (≥1.8 years) were significantly associated with reduced STI-HIV co-infection risk (OR = 0.55, 95%CI: 0.32-0.96, P = 0.036). In further stratification analysis by antiretroviral therapy (ART), individuals with longer duration showed consistent significant associations with STI-HIV co-infection risk (OR = 0.46, 95%CI: 0.26-0.83, P = 0.010) among MSM with ART-naïve status. In addition, significant reduced risk for STI-HIV co-infection (OR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.96-0.99, P = 0.010) were observed in younger (under the average age of 31.03) MSM of the same group. Interestingly, we also found TDR was significantly associated with an increased risk of STI-HIV co-infection risk (OR = 3.84, 95%CI: 1.05-14.03, P = 0.042) in ART-naïve group. Our study highlights a pattern of STI-HIV co-infection among MSM in China and indicates that targeted interventions aimed at encouraging TDR monitoring in MSM with early HIV infection are warranted."

In the present study we report on the case of a patient with a history of drug and alcohol abuse who was sequentially infected with HIV, HCV, HBV and HDV. He died of an overwhelming reactivation of HBV and HDV in spite of a recent interferon treatment. HBV and HDV resumed their active replication after over 20 years of complete latency, that is after long-lasting viral undetectability, when the patient deliberately discontinued his last HAART regimen.

5358,0.001,1.0000,"Entecavir (ETV) was developed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and is globally approved for that indication. Initial preclinical studies indicated that ETV had no significant activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in cultured cell lines at physiologically relevant ETV concentrations, using traditional anti-HIV assays. In response to recent clinical observations of anti-HIV activity of ETV in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients not receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), additional investigative studies were conducted to expand upon earlier results. An extended panel of HIV-1 laboratory and clinical strains and cell types was tested against ETV, along with a comparison of assay methodologies and resistance profiling. These latest studies confirmed that ETV has only weak activity against HIV, using established assay systems. However, a >100-fold enhancement of antiviral activity (equivalent to the antiviral activity of lamivudine) could be obtained when assay conditions were modified to reduce the initial viral challenge. Also, the selection of a M184I virus variant during the passage of HIV-1 at high concentrations of ETV confirmed that ETV can exert inhibitory pressure on the virus. These findings may have a significant impact on how future assays are performed with compounds to be used in patients infected with HIV. These results support the recommendation that ETV therapy should be administered in concert with HAART for HIV/HBV-coinfected patients."
8311,0.001,1.0000,"Since modulation of the glutathione (GSH) level has been implicated in the regulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transcription and expression, we have undertaken an analysis of the effect of sodium valproate (VPA) on HIV-1 replication. VPA, which is an anti-epileptic drug in widespread use in clinical medicine, has been shown to depress the activity of GSH reductase, an enzyme required for maintaining high cellular levels of reduced GSH. The effect of this drug on HIV-1 replication has been studied in primary infected cells, i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocyte/macrophages, in the CEM-SS cell line, and in chronically infected stimulated and non-stimulated U1 cells. We have shown that VPA markedly enhanced viral replication in all infected cells tested. Virus production was induced in U1 cells by VPA treatment and the stimulatory effects of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor were augmented. The LTR-driven gene expression in Jurkat T cells was increased. However, the elevated viral production did not correlate with the effect of VPA on the intracellular GSH level. Thus, VPA stimulated in vitro HIV-1 replication in acutely and chronically infected cells and enhanced LTR-driven gene expression. These effects were observed for concentrations that are reached in the plasma of VPA-treated patients. Therefore, although the clinical significance of these data remains to be demonstrated, these results should be considered in the choice of an anticonvulsant drug in HIV-infected individuals."

The incidence of herpes zoster was significantly higher among HIV-seropositive men (29.4 cases/1000 person-years) than among HIV-seronegative men (2.0 cases/1000 person-years); the overall age-adjusted relative risk (RR) was 16.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7-32.6). When compared with that of age-matched population controls from 1945 to 1959, the incidence of zoster was significantly higher among seropositive men (RR, 26.7; 95% CI, 19.3-37.1) and slightly higher among seronegative men (RR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.0-3.3); the latter may reflect increasing background rates over several decades. The risk of herpes zoster was not associated with duration of HIV infection and was not predictive of faster progression to AIDS."

The VDR-rs1544410_GG polymorphism has been associated with delayed progression rates to AIDS and resistance to HIV-1 infection. The aim of the present study was to investigate differences in VD₃ mediated effects on rs1544410 genotyped dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (MDM), key cells involved in HIV-1 infection. Immature DCs exhibited lower b-actin-normalized VDR mRNA expression in rs1544410_GG compared to cells with a rs1544410_AA genotype. VD₃ response on cell differentiation markers (CD14 inhibition and CD209 induction) was two-fold higher in rs1544410_AA (CD209, p=0.012; CD14, p=0.02). HIV-1-LTR reporter gene activity in MDM was boosted by VD₃; however, the effect was up to 50% higher in rs1544410_AA. We conclude that the rs1544410_AA association with progression to AIDS and resistance to HIV-1 appears to be linked to an enhanced response to VD₃."

In this study, we have evaluated the serum levels of 90K for its ability to predict the progression to ARC or AIDS retrospectively in 49 HIV-seropositive subjects who were initially symptom-free. 90K levels were higher in those HIV-seropositive subjects who progressed to ARC or AIDS than in those who had not progressed both at entry into the study and at the latest visit. CD4+ cell number was not different in the two groups at entry but was lower in the progressors at the latest visit. Evaluation of the patterns of change over time showed that 90K increased and CD4+ cells decreased more in progressors than in nonprogressors. During the 3 years preceding the onset of ARC or AIDS, 90K increased regularly while CD4+ cell decrease was later. Elevated levels of 90K (p = 0.007) and lower numbers of CD4+ cells (p = 0.001) were significantly associated with a higher cumulative incidence of ARC or AIDS. These findings suggest that 90K is an early indicator of progression to ARC and AIDS."
9275,0.001,1.0000,"Coumarins and structurally related compounds have been recently shown to present anti-human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) activity. Among them, the dietary furanocoumarin imperatorin is present in citrus fruits, in culinary herbs, and in some medicinal plants. In this study we report that imperatorin inhibits either vesicular stomatitis virus-pseudotyped or gp160-enveloped recombinant HIV-1 infection in several T cell lines and in HeLa cells. These recombinant viruses express luciferase as a marker of viral replication. Imperatorin did not inhibit the reverse transcription nor the integration steps in the viral cell cycle. Using several 5' long terminal repeat-HIV-1 constructs where critical response elements were either deleted or mutated, we found that the transcription factor Sp1 is critical for the inhibitory activity of imperatorin induced by both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and HIV-1 Tat. Moreover in transient transfections imperatorin specifically inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced transcriptional activity of the Gal4-Sp1 fusion protein. Since Sp1 is also implicated in cell cycle progression we further studied the effect of imperatorin on cyclin D1 gene transcription and protein expression and in HeLa cell cycle progression. We found that imperatorin strongly inhibited cyclin D1 expression and arrested the cells at the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. These results highlight the potential of Sp1 transcription factor as a target for natural anti-HIV-1 compounds such as furanocoumarins that might have a potential therapeutic role in the management of AIDS."
4626,0.001,1.0000,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by the JC virus (JCV), a human papovavirus. PML is a relatively rare disease seen predominantly in immunocompromised individuals and is a frequent complication observed in AIDS patients. The significantly higher incidence of PML in AIDS patients than in other immunosuppressive disorders has suggested that the presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the brain may directly or indirectly contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. In the present study we have examined the expression of the JCV genome in both glial and non-glial cells in the presence of HIV-1 regulatory proteins. We find that the HIV-1-encoded trans-regulatory protein tat increases the basal activity of the JCV late promoter, JCVL, in glial cells. In a reciprocal experiment, the JCV early protein, the large tumor antigen, stimulates expression from JCVL and HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter in both glial and non-glial cells. This trans-activation occurs at the level of RNA synthesis, as measured by the rate of transcription, stability of the message, and translation. We conclude that the presence of the HIV-1-encoded tat protein may positively affect the JCV lytic cycle in glial cells by stimulating JCV gene expression. Our results suggest a mechanism for the relatively high incidence of PML in AIDS patients than in other immunosuppressive disorders. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the HIV-1 regulatory protein tat may stimulate other viral and perhaps cellular promoters, in addition to its own."

We previously showed that blockade of the PD-1 pathway increases HIV-1-associated T cell function in vitro. However, the effect of PD-1 blockade on HIV-1 disease progression in vivo has not been examined. As in humans, HIV-1-infected humanized BALB/c-Rag2(-/-)γc(-/-) (Rag-hu) mice express elevated levels of PD-1 on T cells during chronic infection. To examine the effect of PD-1 blockade on disease progression, Rag-hu mice with chronic HIV-1 infection were treated with a blocking mAb directed against programmed cell death-1 ligand-1, the ligand for PD-1. Programmed cell death-1 ligand-1-treated Rag-hu mice exhibited a progressive decrease in the HIV-1 plasma viral load, with a 7-fold decrease by day 7, a 20-fold decrease by day 14, a 178-fold decrease by day 21, and a 269-fold decrease by day 28 postinitiation of treatment. By day 7, the percentage of CD4(+) T cells was statistically higher in the treated compared with the untreated group, and this trend was sustained throughout the 28-d treatment period. Moreover, there was a strong inverse correlation between plasma viral load and the percentage of both CD4(+) (r = -0.66; p < 0.0001) and CD8(+) (r = -0.64; p < 0.0001) T cells in the treated mice but not the untreated mice. This study provides ""proof of concept"" that humanized mice can be used to examine the effects of immunotherapeutic interventions on HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, to our knowledge, these data demonstrate for the first time that blockade of the PD-1 pathway reduces HIV-1 viral loads."

Nearly 80% of HIV-1-infected hemophiliacs have developed a significant reduction in their CD-4+ counts (less than 400 CD-4+ cells/mm3) with 40% having less than 200 CD-4+ cells/mm3 by the end of 1987. The rate of CD-4+ cell count decline was slightly greater in patients who have already developed the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) compared to those who have not (50 vs. 31 cells/mm3/6 months). Thrombocytopenia and older age were associated with a more rapid CD-4+ count deterioration, but the quantity of clotting factor utilized did not affect immunologic progression. In patients with less than 200 CD-4+ cells/mm3, the incidence of AIDS was significantly higher in adults (greater than 21 years old) compared to children/adolescents. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seroprevalence increased with age but did not correlate with the amount of concentrated clotting factor used. Although there was no relationship between CMV status and progression to AIDS, CMV-seropositive patients were older and had a lower CD-4+ count. Thus the majority of HIV-1-infected hemophiliacs are developing progressive immune dysfunction measured by CD-4+ count decline. This drop in CD-4+ count significantly correlates with a risk for the development of AIDS in adults but not in children (less than 21 years old)."
6453,0.001,1.0000,"Despite the effectiveness of currently available human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) therapies, a continuing need exists for new drugs to treat HIV-1 infection. We investigated the mechanism by which 3-O-[3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl]-betulinic acid (DSB) inhibits HIV-1 replication. DSB functions at a late stage of the virus life cycle but does not inhibit the HIV-1 protease in vitro or interfere with virus assembly or release. DSB specifically delays the cleavage of Gag between the capsid (CA) and p2, resulting in delayed formation of the mature viral core and reduced HIV-1 infectivity. Replication of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) was resistant to DSB; however, a chimeric SIV carrying CA-p2 sequences from HIV-1 was inhibited by the drug, indicating that susceptibility to DSB maps to the CA-p2 region of the HIV-1 Gag protein. A single point mutation at the CA-p2 cleavage site of HIV-1 conferred strong resistance to DSB, confirming the target of the drug. HIV-1 strains that are resistant to a variety of protease inhibitors were sensitive to DSB. These findings indicate that DSB specifically protects the CA-p2 cleavage site from processing by the viral protease during virion maturation, thereby revealing a novel mechanism for pharmacologic inhibition of HIV-1 replication."
2708,0.001,1.0000,"The process of transcriptional activation directed by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) was investigated by in vivo footprinting using ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction in a human epithelial cell line infected with human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6). Infection with both viruses induces a remarkable enhancement in LTR-mediated gene expression that correlates with a change in the pattern of protein binding to the downstream kappa B site of the enhancer region. In HHV-6 infected cells, this change in the genomic footprinting pattern is concomitant with the induction of specific enhancer-binding proteins in the nucleus. The similarity of these events to those detected in other previously investigated experimental systems suggests that the LTR enhancer region is the ultimate target for the induction of the HIV-1 transcriptional response upon stimuli acting through different upstream pathways."

To examine consequences of therapy in this setting, clinical information, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels, CD4 cell counts, and protease and reverse transcriptase sequences were determined for consecutive HIV-1-infected outpatients. Of 48 treatment-naive individuals, 11 were started on therapy for HIV-related symptoms; however, 44 (92%) had an RNA level >20,000 copies/mL, a CD4 cell count <500/mm3, or symptoms. Eighteen (51%) of 35 patients on therapy had an RNA level >20,000 copies/mL. Nucleoside-resistance mutations were observed in 21 (68%) of 31 nucleoside-experienced subjects. Protease mutations necessary for high-level protease inhibitor (PI) resistance were present together with permissive mutations in 3 of 10 PI-experienced patients. Inability to identify high-risk individuals and to detect virologic failure may limit the effectiveness of antiretroviral drug programs and may promote the spread of drug resistance where virologic and immunologic monitoring are not available."

Immunologic response to therapy, as measured by lymphocyte subsets, 3-color flow cytometric measures, and lymphoproliferative assays, were investigated for changes in weeks 44 and 48. The most significant changes after baseline that were associated with the administration of a protease inhibitor-containing regimen were seen for percentages of CD8(+)/CD38(+)/HLA-DR(+), CD8(+)/CD95(+)/CD28(-), and CD8. The percentages of CD8(+)/CD38(+)/HLA-DR(+) and CD8(+)/CD95(+)/CD28(-) decreased from baseline medians of 33% and 46% to medians of 18% and 30% at week 44 (P<.0001 for both). Median CD4 cell count increased 168 cells/microL (from 694 cells/microL to 862 cells/microL; P=.02) by week 48 in this clinically stable population. Changes in lymphoproliferative responses to HIV antigens and recall antigens did not increase over time and between groups."
6036,0.001,1.0000,"Although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome have a high frequency of HIV-specific CD8 T lymphocytes, freshly isolated lymphocytes frequently lack detectable HIV-specific cytotoxicity. However, this effector function becomes readily apparent after overnight culture. To investigate reasons for T-cell dysfunction, we analyzed T-cell expression of the cytolytic protease granzyme A and CD3 zeta, the signaling component of the T-cell receptor complex. An increased proportion of CD4 and CD8 T cells from HIV-infected donors contain granzyme A, consistent with the known increased frequency of activated T cells. In 28 HIV-infected donors with mild to advanced immunodeficiency, a substantial fraction of circulating T cells downmodulated CD3 zeta (fraction of T cells expressing CD3 zeta, 0.74 +/- 0.16 v 1.01 +/- 0.07 in healthy donors; P < .0000005). CD3 zeta expression is downregulated more severely in CD8 than CD4 T cells, decreases early in infection, and correlates with declining CD4 counts and disease stage. CD3 zeta expression increases over 6 to 16 hours of culture in an interleukin-2-dependent manner, coincident with restoration of viral-specific cytotoxicity. Impaired T-cell receptor signaling may help explain why HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to control HIV replication."
518,0.001,1.0000,"The purpose of the current study was to determine the efficacy and safety of nevirapine combined with nelfinavir and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in patients previously exposed to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In a prospective, open-label, randomized study, 56 HIV-infected adults who had received HAART, including saquinavir hard gel capsule, ritonavir, or indinavir, were randomly assigned to receive nevirapine in addition to nelfinavir and two NRTIs. The proportion of patients who achieved an undetectable viral load (plasma HIV-RNA <200 copies/ml) at weeks 24 and 36 was significantly higher in the nevirapine group than in the control group (55% and 52% vs. 22% and 22%; p =.015 and p =.047). No differences in CD4 cell count or clinical outcome were observed. In the nevirapine group, 17% of patients discontinued treatment because of rashes. We conclude that the addition of nevirapine, when switching from one protease inhibitor-containing regimen to one containing nelfinavir, has a substantial effect on viral suppression."
3667,0.001,1.0000,"We reported recently that exposure of human T cells to soluble HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 induced biologically active tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-related cytokine receptor of activated NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL), the primary drive to osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Furthermore, certain anti-HIV protease inhibitors linked clinically to accelerated bone loss in HIV disease blocked the physiological control of RANKL activity by interferon (IFN)-gamma through inhibition of degradation of the RANKL nuclear adapter signalling protein, TNF receptor associated protein 6 (TRAF6). We now report a series of reciprocal interactions among HIV-1, RANKL and IFN-gamma. RANKL augmented HIV replication in acutely and chronically infected cells of T lymphocyte and monocyte lineage, effects which occurred at a transcriptional level in conjunction with activation of NF-kappaB. TNF-alpha and RANKL were markedly synergistic in induction of HIV. Low pharmacological levels of IFN-gamma (0.75-3 ng/ml) suppressed RANKL-driven enhancement of HIV replication, as did L-T6DP-1, a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of TRAF6. In contrast, HIV replication induced by TNF-alpha and phorbol ester were not inhibited, and in some cases augmented, by IFN-gamma. We conclude that a positive feedback loop exists between RANKL production and HIV replication, which may be relevant to both the pathophysiology of HIV-linked osteopenia and control of HIV growth. This pathway appears distinct from those of other cytokine activators of HIV, with respect to its utilization of TRAF6 and its suppression by IFN-gamma. These data raise the possibility that TRAF-specific inhibitory peptides, alone or in conjunction with IFN-gamma, could be used to regulate HIV activation in vivo."
9017,0.001,1.0000,"To explore CD4-cell and viral evolution in relation to different levels of HIV-1 replication, as observed during protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy. Adult HIV-1 infected cohort patients, receiving historical salvage therapy with daily doses of saquinavir (2,000 mg), ritonavir (200 mg) and either lopinavir (800 mg) or atazanavir (300 mg) for >36 weeks were retrospectively analysed for highest detectable viral load up to week 96 and assigned to groups according to the viral load level: always <50 copies/ml (1), 50-199 copies/ml (2), 200-499 copies/ml (3) and ≥500 copies/ml (4). A total of 126 patients were evaluated; at baseline, median CD4-cell count was 204/mm(3), HIV-1 RNA was 5.13 Log10-copies/ml and duration of prior HIV-1 infection was 11.7 years. Patients were assigned by 43, 30, 7 and 20 % to groups 1-4. Median observation time was 136 weeks (range: 38-304); at weeks 48/96, the CD4-cell gains for groups 1-4 were +88/+209, +209/+349, +67/+300 and +114.5/+ 128, respectively. After fitting data in a linear fixed effect model, ascending CD4 slopes were continuously increasing for group 1, similarly for 2 and clearly decreasing for 3-4 (p = 0.0006). Of 25 individuals from group 4, patient number with major IAS-USA protease mutations increased from 5 to 10 before and after failing PI therapy, whereas minor mutations remained stable (n = 18). On double-boosted PI therapy, CD4-cell increases through week 96 were similar for patients at always undetectable or with detection of low viral load. Viral detection >200 copies/ml was associated with decreasing CD4-cell slopes and emergence of major mutations, supporting this as benchmark for virological failure definition on PI therapy."
5483,0.001,1.0000,"The evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection is associated with a shift in the target cell population, driven by variability in coreceptor utilization resulting from diversity in env. To elucidate the potential consequences of these changes for Env-mediated fusion over the course of AIDS, we examined the biological properties of serial viral isolates and determined coreceptor utilization by the products of env cloned from two individuals, followed from the detection of seroconversion throughout the course of their infection. One had a typical course, and the other had an accelerated progression. Early isolates were non-syncytium inducing, and the corresponding Env exclusively utilized CCR5, whereas Env from late phases of infection showed restricted utilization of CXCR4 in both patients. Env from subject SC24, who had a standard progression, demonstrated multitropism, manifested by utilization of CCR3, CXCR4, and CCR5 in the intervening period. In contrast, Env from patient SC51, who experienced early conversion to the syncytium-inducing phenotype, developed dualtropic coreceptor utilization of CCR5 and CXCR4. Genetic analysis of env from each isolate revealed that those with an X4 phenotype formed a distinct subcluster within each subject. Analysis of chimeras constructed from R5 and multispecific env from patient SC24 demonstrated that while the V3 domain played a dominant role in determining coreceptor utilization, sequences in the V4-V5 region also contributed to the latter phenotype. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the hybrid Env proteins were expressed at similar levels. These experiments demonstrate that progression from the R5 to X4 phenotype may occur through a multi- or dual-tropic intermediate and that multiple domains contribute to this process."
5827,0.001,1.0000,"A patient with HIV infection who experienced immune reconstitution after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [increase in CD4 T cell count from <1/microl to >600/microl] presented with severe Graves' disease 32 months after commencing HAART. A comprehensive clinical and laboratory study demonstrated pronounced regional lymphadenopathy and thymic enlargement at presentation, and that the onset of thyrotropin receptor antibody production was associated with increased production of soluble CD30 (a marker of type 2 immune responses). Blood naive CD8 T cell counts and TREC levels in both CD4 and CD8 T cells were increased at multiple time points compared with carefully selected controls. We conclude that the Graves' disease in this patient was associated with abnormally high blood counts of thymus-derived T cells, and propose that Graves' disease after HAART in this and other HIV patients may result from failure to delete autoreactive T cell clones in the regenerating thymus."
5494,0.001,1.0000,"Data on the pharmacogenetic markers of CYP2B6 and biological factors associated with hepatotoxicity in HIV-infected patients receiving an efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen are very limited. A total of 134 HIV-infected Thai adults were prospectively enrolled to receive a once-daily regimen of efavirenz 600 mg/tenofovir/lamivudine. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CYP2B6 were genotyped using real-time PCR. At 12 weeks after ART, plasma efavirenz concentrations at 12h after dosing were measured. The mean ± standard deviation patient age was 37 ± 8 years, and 77.6% were male. The median (IQR) CD4 count was 43 cells/mm(3) (17-105 cells/mm(3)). Eighteen patients (13.4%) had positive anti-HCV and 5 patients (3.7%) had positive HBsAg. The frequencies of heterozygous/homozygous mutants of each SNP were 64C>T (11%), 499C>G (0%), 516G>T (55%), 785A>G (63%), 1375A>G (0%), 1459C>T (3%) and 21563C>T (62%). The three most frequent haplotypes identified included *1/*6 (40.3%), *1/*1 (34.3%) and *6/*6 (8.2%). The median (IQR) plasma efavirenz concentration was 2.3mg/L (1.4-3.7 mg/L). At 24 weeks, median (IQR) serum ALP was 98 mg/dL (73-133 mg/dL) and direct bilirubin was 0.11 mg/dL (0.10-0.19 mg/dL). The proportion of grade 1 and grade 2 elevated serum ALP was 12.7% and 1.5%, respectively. By multivariate analysis, factors associated with high ALP, total bilirubin and direct bilirubin included CYP2B6 haplotype *6/*6, high serum ALP at Week 0 and positive anti-HCV (all P<0.05). In summary, HIV-infected patients with the pharmacogenetic marker 'CYP2B6 haplotype *6/*6' may have increased susceptibility to hepatotoxicity with efavirenz-based ART."
7644,0.001,1.0000,"Varicella (chicken pox) is a common viral infection in children and generally runs a benign course. However, in adults, and especially in immunocompromised subjects such as those on immunosuppressant therapy or with AIDS, varicella infection is particularly severe and is associated with the formation of hemorrhagic skin lesions and visceral involvement. These patients are at an increased risk of developing varicella hepatitis, which frequently results in fulminant hepatic failure and death. In the present report, we describe for the first time the course of disease and the histological appearance of varicella hepatitis in a patient infected with the human T cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) I and II; these viruses have many characteristics in common with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Our patient had a relatively benign illness, suggesting that varicella infection in the presence of HTLVI and II may not run as severe a course as it does in patients with HIV infection."
3620,0.001,1.0000,"Recently, a 15-fold increased risk of T cell lymphomas has been estimated in HIV-infected populations. This increase has been observed for all T cell lymphoma subtypes. In the present report we describe clinical and pathological features of three consecutive cases of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) with cytotoxic phenotype in HIV-positive patients that came to our attention in May-September 2002. The diagnosis of PTCL was made in lymph node (two cases) and in needle biopsies from liver and bone marrow of the same patient. The patients were two females (31 and 45 years old) and one male (49 years old). The risk factor for each patient was heterosexual, injecting drug user, and homosexual, respectively. CD4 cell counts were low (79-81 cells/mm3). Two patients were naive for antiretroviral therapy. At histological examination, all the involved tissues were effaced by a neoplastic proliferation of CD3+/CD8+ medium to large pleomorphic cells containing TIA-1+ cytotoxic granules and a few granzyme B+ granules. Neoplastic cells were not infected by EBV or by HHV-8. They were negative for the B cell antigens CD20 and CD79a, for CD30 and for CD56. Clonal T cell receptor-g (TCR-g) rearrangements were demonstrated in the three cases."
2141,0.001,1.0000,Invasive pneumococcal infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-1-infected individuals. B cells play an important role in maintaining serologic memory after infection. IgM memory B cells are significantly reduced in HIV-1-infected patients and their frequency is similar to that observed in other patient groups (splenectomized individuals and patients with primary Ab deficiency) who are also known to have an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal infection. Antiretroviral therapy does not restore marginal zone B cell percentages. Immunization with the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine shows that HIV-1-infected patients have impaired total IgM and IgG pneumococcal vaccines compared with healthy controls. Loss of switched memory B cells was associated with impaired tetanus toxoid IgG vaccine responses. Results of this study demonstrate that defects in B cell memory subsets are associated with impaired humoral immune responses in HIV-1 patients who are receiving antiretroviral therapy and may be a contributory factor to the increased risk of invasive pneumococcal infection observed in HIV-1 infection.
5812,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of our study is to determine the role of oxidative stress on hepatic damage in patients with acute and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the efficacy of antioxidant-enzyme system against oxidative stress. Furthermore, the effect of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) plus lamivudine therapy on oxidative stress was also investigated. Nineteen patients with acute hepatitis B virus (AHBV) infection, 17 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (CHBV) infection, 24 inactive HBsAg carriers and 21 healthy controls were included in the study. In control and patient groups, serum alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, erythrocyte malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were measured. In CHBV group, after IFN-alpha plus lamivudine therapy for 6 months, these parameters were measured again. In all patient groups erythrocyte MDA levels were detected higher than control group (p < 0.05). Activity of CuZn-SOD was found to be the highest in AHBV (p < 0.05), and the lowest before the treatment in CHBV group (p < 0.05) compared with other groups. Activity of GSH-Px was found to be the highest in AHBV compared with inactive HBsAg carriers (p < 0.05) and CHBV group before treatment (p < 0.05). Activity of GSH-Px was found to be the lowest in CHBV group before treatment compared with other groups (p < 0.05). In CHBV group there was a significant decrease of MDA levels after treatment (p < 0.05) while there was a significant increase in activity of CuZn-SOD and GSH-Px compared with pretreatment levels (p < 0.05). A significant positive correlation was determined between MDA values and serum ALT levels, before and after the treatment (p < 0.05). Detection of the increase of MDA levels which is a product of lipid peroxidation in all patient groups, indicates that the oxidative stress is increased in HBV infection. Correlation between the levels of erythrocyte MDA levels and serum ALT levels supports the hypothesis concerning the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of HBV infection. Insufficiency of antioxidant capacity in CHBV and inactive HBsAg carrier groups may lead to progression of disease and results in fibrosis. Treatment with IFN-alpha plus lamivudine causes a decrease in products of lipid peroxidation and shows antioxidant activity via increasing the antioxidant enzymes. These data suggest that the addition of antioxidant agents to IFN-alpha and lamivudin combination therapy may be useful in CHBV treatment. Further in-vitro and in-vivo studies are required to enlighten the role of antioxidants on HBV disease progression and treatment."
4469,0.001,1.0000,"Hospital infection control measures are crucial to tuberculosis (TB) control strategies within settings caring for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, as these patients are at heightened risk of developing TB. Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a potent drug that effectively sterilizes persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli. However, PZA resistance associated with mutations in the nicotinamidase/pyrazinamidase coding gene, pncA, is increasing. A total of 794 patient isolates obtained from four sites in Lima, Peru, underwent spoligotyping and drug resistance testing. In one of these sites, the HIV unit of Hospital Dos de Mayo (HDM), an isolation ward for HIV/TB coinfected patients opened during the study as an infection control intervention: circulating genotypes and drug resistance pre- and postintervention were compared. All other sites cared for HIV-negative outpatients: genotypes and drug resistance rates from these sites were compared with those from HDM. HDM patients showed high concordance between multidrug resistance, PZA resistance according to the Wayne method, the two most common genotypes (spoligotype international type [SIT] 42 of the Latino American-Mediterranean (LAM)-9 clade and SIT 53 of the T1 clade), and the two most common pncA mutations (G145A and A403C). These associations were absent among community isolates. The infection control intervention was associated with 58-92% reductions in TB caused by SIT 42 or SIT 53 genotypes (odds ratio [OR] = 0.420, P = 0.003); multidrug-resistant TB (OR = 0.349, P < 0.001); and PZA-resistant TB (OR = 0.076, P < 0.001). In conclusion, pncA mutation typing, with resistance testing and spoligotyping, was useful in identifying a nosocomial TB outbreak and demonstrating its resolution after implementation of infection control measures."
5184,0.001,1.0000,"Suboptimal treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) often results in the rapid selection of drug-resistant virus. Several amino acid substitutions at position 190 of reverse transcriptase (RT) have been associated with reduced susceptibility to the NNRTI, especially nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV). In the present study, the effects of various 190 substitutions observed in viruses obtained from NNRTI-experienced patients were characterized with patient-derived HIV isolates and confirmed with a panel of isogenic viruses. Compared to wild-type HIV, which has a glycine at position 190 (G190), viruses with 190 substitutions (A, C, Q, S, V, E, or T, collectively referred to as G190X substitutions) were markedly less susceptible to NVP and EFV. In contrast, delavirdine (DLV) susceptibility of these G190X viruses increased from 3 to 300-fold (hypersusceptible) or was only slightly decreased. The replication capacity of viruses with certain 190 substitutions (C, Q, V, T, and E) was severely impaired and was correlated with reduced virion-associated RT activity and incomplete protease (PR) processing of the viral p55(gag) polyprotein. These defects were the result of inadequate p160(gagpol) incorporation into virions. Compensatory mutations within RT and PR improved replication capacity, p55(gag) processing, and RT activity, presumably through increased incorporation of p160(gagpol) into virions. We observe an inverse relationship between the degree of NVP and EFV resistance and the impairment of viral replication in viruses with substitutions at 190 in RT. These observations may have important implications for the future design and development of antiretroviral drugs that restrict the outgrowth of resistant variants with high replication capacity."
6894,0.001,1.0000,"The complexity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) immunopathogenesis has prompted multiple strategic approaches to re-establish normal immune responses. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can control viral replication, but it is unable to restore HIV-specific immunity. Newer approaches for managing HIV infection are focusing on cell-mediated immune responses, including the potential for improved immunologic control over HIV replication. Cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-12, are being evaluated for their ability to enhance cell-mediated immunity, which is thought to be critical for immunologic control. Initial studies with IL-2 have demonstrated an improvement in CD4 cell counts, and large randomized trials are underway to determine the long-term clinical efficacy of IL-2 in combination with antiretroviral therapy, including HAART. Stimulating the immune response against HIV by use of exogenous (therapeutic vaccination) or endogenous (structured treatment interruption) antigens with or without immune adjuvants or cytokines, such as IL-2, is another approach currently being explored."
8737,0.001,1.0000,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected cats enter a clinically asymptomatic phase during chronic infection. Despite the lack of overt clinical disease, the asymptomatic phase is characterized by persistent immunologic impairment. In the peripheral blood obtained from cats experimentally infected with FIV-C for approximately 5 years, we identified a persistent inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio. We cloned and sequenced the FIV-C long terminal repeat containing the viral promoter from cells infected with the inoculating virus and from in vivo-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4 T cells isolated at multiple time points throughout the asymptomatic phase. Relative to the inoculating virus, viral sequences amplified from cells isolated from all of the infected animals demonstrated multiple single nucleotide mutations and a short deletion within the viral U3, R and U5 regions. A transcriptionally inactivating proviral mutation in the U3 promoter AP-1 site was identified at multiple time points from all of the infected animals but not within cell-associated viral RNA. In contrast, no mutations were identified within the sequence of the viral dUTPase gene amplified from PBMC isolated at approximately 5 years post-infection relative to the inoculating sequence. The possible implications of these mutations to viral pathogenesis are discussed. "
3109,0.001,1.0000,"The growing number of cases of acute hepatitis C (AHC) infections among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in the last 10 years has promoted the search for predictors of AHC clearance as well as for epidemiological networks of viral transmission. We characterized the diversity and catalytic efficiency of HCV NS3/4A protease quasispecies in AHC patients coinfected with HIV-1. Plasma samples obtained at HCV diagnosis from 18 MSM HIV-coinfected patients with AHC were studied. Five HCV monoinfected patient samples with AHC were also investigated. An average of 39 clones from each sample was analysed. The catalytic efficiency of the dominant quasispecies (i.e. the most abundant) from each quasispecies was also assayed for mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) cleavage. Phylogenetic analysis identified two clusters of patients with highly related viruses, suggesting a common source of HCV infection. None of the 18 MSM HIV-coinfected patients spontaneously cleared HCV, although 78% of the treated patients achieved a sustained virological response after early treatment with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) plus ribavirin (RBV). The synonymous-nonsynonymous (ds/dn) mutation ratio, a marker of selective pressure, was higher in AHC compared to 26 HIV-1-infected men with genotype 1a chronic hepatitis C (CHC) (P < 0.0001). NS3/4A proteases from AHC patients also exhibited higher catalytic efficiency compared to CHC patients (P < 0.0001). No differences were found when ds/dn mutation ratios and NS3/4A protease catalytic efficiencies from AHC HIV-coinfected patients were compared with AHC monoinfected patients. The presence of epidemiological networks of HCV transmission was confirmed among HIV-1-positive MSM. In addition, substantial genetic diversity was demonstrated in AHC. NS3/4A protease efficiency cleaving MAVS may be associated with virus transmission and response to pegIFN/RBV treatment."
4102,0.001,1.0000,"Viral mutations have been implicated in alteration of the biological phenotype of hepatitis B virus (HBV). We recently cloned and sequenced the viral genome of an HBV strain associated with an outbreak of fulminant hepatitis (FH strain). The FH strain contained numerous mutations in all genomic regions and was functionally characterized by a more efficient encapsidation of pregenomic RNA leading to highly enhanced replication. To define the responsible mutation(s) for the enhanced replication, we introduced individual mutations of the FH strain into a wild-type construct by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of viral replication showed that two adjacent mutations in the HBV core promotor (C to T at nucleotide 1768 and T to A at nucleotide 1770) led to high level replication. Similar to the FH strain, this mutant displayed the phenotype of enhanced encapsidation of pregenomic RNA. Functional studies in an encapsidation assay demonstrated that the identified mutations resulted in a minor increase of pregenomic RNA transcription (two- to threefold) and a major transcription-independent enhancement (> 10-fold) of viral encapsidation. Our results demonstrate that the two adjacent mutations in the HBV core promotor region are responsible for the enhanced replication of the FH strain. These two mutations, outside the previously described encapsidation signal, core, and polymerase polypeptides, appeared to affect a novel genetic element involved in viral encapsidation."
1977,0.001,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to investigate whether the restored immune functions of vertically human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children who were severely immunodeficient before the initiation of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) are comparable to those of untreated slow progressors. We therefore assessed T cell proliferation and cytokine [interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13] secretions after mitogen, recall antigens and HIV-1-specific stimulation in 12 untreated slow progressors, 16 untreated progressors and 18 treated patients. Treated children were profoundly immunodeficient before the initiation of HAART and had long-lasting suppression of viral replication on treatment. We demonstrated that slow progressors are characterized not only by the preservation of HIV-1-specific lymphoproliferative responses but also by the fact that these responses are clearly T helper type 1 (Th1)-polarized. Children on HAART had proliferative responses to HIV-1 p24 antigen, purified protein derivative (PPD) and tetanus antigen similar to slow progressors and higher than those of progressors. However, in contrast to slow progressors, most treated children exhibited a release of Th2 cytokines accompanying the IFN-γ secretion in response to the HIV-1 p24 antigen. Moreover, despite higher proliferative responses to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) than the two groups of untreated children, treated children had lower levels of IFN-γ secretion in response to PHA than slow progressors. These data show that in severely immunodeficient vertically HIV-infected children, a long-lasting HAART allows recovering lymphoproliferative responses similar to untreated slow progressors. However, alterations in IFN-γ secretion in response to the mitogen PHA persisted, and their cytokine release after HIV-specific stimulation was biased towards a Th2 response."
5093,0.001,1.0000,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the nail unit is a rare disorder. An association with high-risk genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been reported. We report a 28-year-old human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected bisexual man who had multiple invasive SCC of the fingers, infected with the rare type HPV 26. Classification of HPV 26 as high- or intermediate-risk type has been uncertain, due to its rare presence in cervical cancer. Despite successful treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the patient developed extensive hyperkeratotic nailbed proliferations of all fingers. Tumours were refractory to treatment and invaded into adjacent tissues. X-rays of the hands demonstrated bone invasion, necessitating amputation of distal phalanges of several fingers. Histologically, highly differentiated preinvasive and invasive verrucous SCCs were identified. Molecular DNA typing identified HPV 26 in the SCCs and in some premalignant lesions. By in situ hybridization HPV 26 DNA was detected in numerous tumour cells, indicating productive infection with high-level amplification of the viral genome. In the remaining proliferations, high-risk HPV type 58, cutaneous HPVs and a putative new HPV type were identified. HPV 26 infection appears to be causally involved in the development of SCC of the nail unit in this immunosuppressed patient. Timely evaluation of chronic verrucous nailbed tumours is recommended, especially in immunocompromised patients. Identification of HPV 26, besides known high-risk HPV types, may identify patients at risk for developing SCC of the nailbed and possibly at other locations."
5581,0.001,1.0000,"Worldwide, some 240 million people have chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), with the highest rates of infection in Africa and Asia. Our understanding of the natural history of HBV infection and the potential for therapy of the resultant disease is continuously improving. New data have become available since the previous APASL guidelines for management of HBV infection were published in 2012. The objective of this manuscript is to update the recommendations for the optimal management of chronic HBV infection. The 2015 guidelines were developed by a panel of Asian experts chosen by the APASL. The clinical practice guidelines are based on evidence from existing publications or, if evidence was unavailable, on the experts' personal experience and opinion after deliberations. Manuscripts and abstracts of important meetings published through January 2015 have been evaluated. This guideline covers the full spectrum of care of patients infected with hepatitis B, including new terminology, natural history, screening, vaccination, counseling, diagnosis, assessment of the stage of liver disease, the indications, timing, choice and duration of single or combination of antiviral drugs, screening for HCC, management in special situations like childhood, pregnancy, coinfections, renal impairment and pre- and post-liver transplant, and policy guidelines. However, areas of uncertainty still exist, and clinicians, patients, and public health authorities must therefore continue to make choices on the basis of the evolving evidence. The final clinical practice guidelines and recommendations are presented here, along with the relevant background information. "
9410,0.001,1.0000,"The therapeutic response among patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) of genotype 1 remains suboptimal. We examined a large database of patients treated with combination therapy (ribavirin plus an interferon [IFN]). We hypothesized that the longer the duration that the virus load was rendered undetectable in serum, the better would be the probability of a sustained viral response (SVR). A model predicting SVR was generated; it included the following covariates: duration of continuous nondetectability of an HCV load in serum, estimated creatinine clearance, and whether the isolate was of genotype 1. The validation model demonstrated positive and negative predictive values as well as sensitivity and specificity exceeding 90%. The model predicted that patients infected with HCV genotype 1 require continuous nondetectability of virus load in serum for 36 and 32 weeks, to attain 90% and 80% probabilities, respectively, of a SVR. The average time to clear serum of genotype-1 virus was 30.4 weeks, which indicates that the 48-week duration of therapy provided a suboptimal probability of a SVR. For some patients, suboptimal therapy with pegylated IFN plus ribavirin may need to be of longer duration than the currently recommended 48 weeks. This hypothesis requires prospective validation."
2789,0.001,1.0000,"Nucleot(s)ide analogues and peginterferon (PEG-IFN) treatment are the only approved therapies for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, complete eradication of the virus, as indicated by persistent loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), is rare among treated patients. This is due to long-term persistence of the HBV genome in infected hepatocytes in the form of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). In this study, we investigated whether administration of a large dose of a nucleoside analogue in combination with PEG-IFN can achieve long-term loss of HBsAg in human hepatocyte chimeric mice. Mice were treated with a high dose of entecavir and/or PEG-IFN for 6 weeks. High-dose combination therapy with both drugs resulted in persistently negative HBV DNA in serum. Although small amounts of HBV DNA and cccDNA (0.1 and 0.01 copy/cell, respectively) remained in the mouse livers, some of the mice remained persistently negative for serum HBV DNA at 13 weeks after cessation of the therapy. Serum HBsAg and hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) continued to decrease and eventually became negative at 12 weeks after cessation of the therapy. Analysis of the HBV genome in treated mice showed accumulation of G-to-A hypermutation and CpG III island methylation. Persistent loss of serum HBV DNA and loss of HBV markers by high-dose entecavir and PEG-IFN combination treatment in chimeric mice suggests that control of HBV can be achieved even in the absence of a cellular immune response."
7259,0.001,1.0000,"The standard treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C consists of pegylated interferon (PegIFN) alpha in combination with ribavirin. Information on treatment effectiveness outside clinical trials is sparse. To study community-based health care, a regional network supported by the German network of competence for hepatitis (Hep-Net) was created between gastroenterologists in private practice and a tertiary referral centre. A treatment register containing evidence-based guidelines was established and 212 consecutive patients who were treated with either PegIF Nalpha 2a/ribavirin (n = 126) or PegIFNalpha2b/ribavirin (n = 86) for 24 weeks (HCV genotype 2, 3) and 48 weeks (HCV genotype 1, 4, 5), respectively, were included and followed prospectively. Twenty-four weeks after cessation of antiviral treatment a sustained virological response was achieved in 54 % of the patients. By univariate analyses, infection with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 (p < 0.0001), younger age (p < 0.0001), normal gamma-glutamyltransferase levels before initiation of treatment (p = 0.003), and absence of language communication problems (p = 0.023) were associated with a sustained virological response. The presence of liver cirrhosis in patients with HCV genotype 1, 4, 5 infection was associated with lower sustained response rates (p = 0.025). Patients infected with HCV genotype 1 in whom the PegIFNalpha dose was reduced had higher virological relapse rates (p = 0.049). With regard to the treating physician, sustained virological response rates ranged from 26 - 67 % in patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Our study shows that virological response rates similar to those in international randomised clinical trials can be achieved by private practice gastroenterologists. The presented network allows characterization of the treatment outcome in chronic hepatitis C not only with regard to virus- and host-related factors but also on an individual physician basis."
9743,0.001,1.0000,"The rates of immunologic and clinical progression are lower in patients with drug-resistant HIV compared to wild-type HIV. This difference is not fully explained by viral load. It has been argued that reductions in T cell activation and/or viral fitness might result in preserved target cells and an altered relationship between the level of viremia and the rate of CD4+ T cell loss. We tested this hypothesis over time in a cohort of patients with highly resistant HIV. Fifty-four antiretroviral-treated patients with multi-drug resistant HIV and detectable plasma HIV RNA were followed longitudinally. CD4+ T cell counts and HIV RNA levels were measured every 4 weeks and T cell activation (CD38/HLA-DR) was measured every 16 weeks. We found that the levels of CD4+ T cell activation over time were a strong independent predictor of CD4+ T cell counts while CD8+ T cell activation was more strongly associated with viremia. Using spectral analysis, we found strong evidence for oscillatory (or cyclic) behavior in CD4+ T cell counts, HIV RNA levels, and T cell activation. Each of the cell populations exhibited an oscillatory behavior with similar frequencies. Collectively, these data suggest that there may be a mechanistic link between T cell activation, CD4+ T cell counts, and viremia and lends support for the hypothesis of altered predator-prey dynamics as a possible explanation of the stability of CD4+ T cell counts in the presence of sustained multi-drug resistant viremia."
3555,0.001,1.0000,"Sooty mangabeys (SMs) naturally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) do not develop AIDS despite high levels of virus replication. At present, the mechanisms underlying this disease resistance are poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that SIV-infected SMs avoid immunodeficiency as a result of virus replication occurring in infected cells that live significantly longer than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected human cells. To this end, we treated six SIV-infected SMs with potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) and longitudinally measured the decline in plasma viremia. We applied the same mathematical models used in HIV-infected individuals and observed that SMs naturally infected with SIV also present a two-phase decay of viremia following ART, with the bulk (92 to 99%) of virus replication sustained by short-lived cells (average life span, 1.06 days), and only 1 to 8% occurring in longer-lived cells. In addition, we observed that ART had a limited impact on CD4(+) T cells and the prevailing level of T-cell activation and proliferation in SIV-infected SMs. Collectively, these results suggest that in SIV-infected SMs, similar to HIV type 1-infected humans, short-lived activated CD4(+) T cells, rather than macrophages, are the main source of virus production. These findings indicate that a short in vivo life span of infected cells is a common feature of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic primate lentivirus infections and support a model for AIDS pathogenesis whereby the direct killing of infected cells by HIV is not the main determinant of disease progression."

Altogether 280 general practitioners working in Oxfordshire were sent a postal questionnaire inquiring about their education, knowledge, current practice, and attitudes in relation to managing infections with HIV. Of the 235 (84%) general practitioners who replied, nine out of 10 were giving advice about infection with HIV to their patients. One in two were testing patients for such infection, and one in four were caring for infected patients. Nevertheless, uncertainty remained about the risks of transmission of infection with HIV and general practitioners' knowledge of educational activities for their patients could be improved. The introduction of a facilitator to work with general practitioners in managing patients with AIDS or infection with HIV is planned, especially to help general practitioners develop the skills needed for prevention."
3238,0.001,1.0000,"Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common worldwide. The current guidelines for the treatment of HIV infection recommend that HIV patients coinfected with HBV receive antiretoroviral therapy (ART) with two nucleoside analogs against HBV. However, an increase in liver enzymes that is usually attributed to HBV immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) sometimes occurs in HBV/HIV-coinfected patients after the commencement of ART. We report a case of HBV/HIV-coinfection in which the chronic hepatitis B was successfully treated using interferon (IFN) therapy followed by ART without the development of IRIS. A Japanese man in thirties was referred to our hospital because of an acute HIV infection two months after the diagnosis of an acute HBV infection, which had progressed to a chronic HBV infection. The laboratory test results were as follows:hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive, HBV DNA level of 8.8 Log copies/mL, HBV genotype A, alanine aminotransferase of 834 IU/L, HIV RNA level of 5 Log copies/mL, and a CD4+ T cell count of 437/microL. The initial treatment was natural IFNalpha therapy for chronic hepatitis B, and HBeAg seroclearance was achieved 20 weeks after the start of therapy. Four months after the end of IFN therapy for 24 weeks, ART including tenofovir and emtricitabine against HBV was commenced. Six months after starting ART, the patient's serum HBV DNA level had decreased and become undetectable and HBsAg seroclearance was achieved without an elevation in liver enzymes. The present case suggests that IFN therapy prior to ART contributes to a successful outcome for chronic hepatitis B patients coinfected with HIV, if the HIV status does not require the immediate start of ART."
6447,0.001,1.0000,"Since their introduction, hepatotoxicity has been associated with the use of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protease inhibitors (PIs). However, the complexity of the HIV-infected patient and the combinations of medications used to treat HIV complicate the understanding of the independent effects of PIs in the development of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). I discuss the current understanding of PI-associated hepatotoxicity. Of the PI regimens studied, the greatest risk of DILI has been observed among patients receiving full-dose ritonavir. Similarly, hepatitis B and/or C virus coinfection has been associated with a greater risk of DILI, compared with those with no hepatitis. Although the specific mechanism by which viral hepatitis increases this risk is not known, patients with cirrhosis may have decreased cytochrome P450 activity, leading to increased PI exposure. Clearly, further research is needed to define the interaction of PIs and chronic viral hepatitis in the development of DILI."
6378,0.001,1.0000,"After the introduction of second generation ELISA and confirmatory tests clinically available, it was possible to determine that prevalence of infection with HCV was 98% among hemophiliacs exposed to factor VIII concentrates that weren't submitted to viral inactivation. Liver failure is 4.2 times more probable among patients also infected with HIV. The hepatocellular carcinoma studies show similar findings. They report a rate of 1.4 for every 1,000 hemophiliacs, and almost all patients have antibodies for hepatitis C virus. The studies with hemophiliacs exposed to unsafe blood products for HCV showed a significant increase in mortality from different liver diseases, as compared to control subjects. Mortality rate shows an important increase in the hemophiliacs also infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Combination therapy (ribavirin and interferon) doesn't seem to make a difference in the response rate as compared to patients without hemophilia. In spite of the best efforts to improve the safety of factor VIII concentrates, it has been impossible to eliminate the risk of transmission of other infective agents. That's why it seems that recombinant technology will be the answer in obtaining the concentrates."
458,0.001,1.0000,"Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is known to increase the risk of death from severe liver disease and, because HCV status is strongly associated with a history of injecting drug use, the effect of a key disease progression cofactor, infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is of interest. We examined all-cause, liver-related and drug-related mortality and excess risk of death from these causes in a large cohort of HCV-monoinfected and HIV-coinfected persons in Scotland. The study population consisted of 20,163 persons confirmed to be infected with hepatitis C through laboratory testing in Scotland between 1991 and 2005. Records with sufficient identifiers were linked to the General Register Office for Scotland death register to retrieve associated mortality data, and were further linked to a national database of HIV-positive individuals to determine coinfection status. A total of 1715 HCV monoinfected and 305 HIV coinfected persons died of any cause during the follow-up period (mean of 5.4 and 6.4 years, respectively). Significant excess mortality was observed in both HCV monoinfected and HIV coinfected populations from liver-related underlying causes (standardised mortality ratios of 25, 95% CI = 23-27; and 37, 95% CI = 26-52 for the two groups, respectively) and drug-related causes (25, 95% CI = 23-27; 39, 95% CI = 28-53. The risk of death from hepatocellular carcinoma, alcoholic or non-alcoholic liver disease, or from a drug-related cause, was greatly increased compared with the general Scottish population, with the highest standardised mortality ratio observed for hepatocellular carcinoma in the monoinfected group (70, 95% CI = 57-85). This study has revealed considerable excess mortality from liver- and drug-related causes in the Scottish HCV-diagnosed population; these data are crucial to inform on the clinical management, and projected future public health burden, of HCV infection."

7638,0.001,1.0000,"Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) is the most common cause of focal deficits in patients living with HIV/AIDS. Among 257 HIV-infected adult patients seen between January 2006 and December 2010 in a tertiary hospital in Zaria, northern Nigeria, 9 (3.5%) patients had clinical, serological, and brain imaging evidence of TE. All 9 patients had CD4 count of less than 50 cells/mm(3). Of the 9 patients, 7 were antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive, while 2 were cases of ART-induced TE-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. After administering intravenous dexamethasone for cerebral decompression and specific antitoxoplasma therapy, symptoms and signs resolved in 8 patients within 4 to 14 days, but 1 patient died. Our data suggest that even in the ART era in Nigeria, TE remains a fairly common cause of morbidity among HIV-infected patients due to late HIV diagnosis and significant immunosuppression at diagnosis. Early HIV diagnosis, early initiation of highly active ART, and routine prophylaxis against TE are imperative in combating the challenge of HIV/AIDS-related TE in Nigeria. "
2436,0.001,1.0000,"The Vif (virion infectivity factor protein of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) is essential for viral replication in vivo and productive infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, and H9 T-cells. However, the molecular mechanism(s) of Vif remains unknown and needs to be further determined. In this report, we show that, like many other proteins encoded by HIV-1, Vif proteins possess a strong tendency toward self-association. In relatively native conditions, Vif proteins formed multimers in vitro, including dimers, trimers, or tetramers. Through in vivo binding assays such as coimmunoprecipitation and the mammalian two-hybrid system, we also demonstrated that Vif proteins could interact with each other within a cell, indicating that the multimerization of Vif proteins is not simply due to fortuitous aggregation. Further studies indicated that the domain affecting Vif self-association is located at the C terminus of this protein, especially the proline-enriched 151-164 region. Moreover, we found that a Vif mutant with deletion at amino acid 151-164 was unable to rescue the infectivity of vif-defective viruses generated from H9 T-cells, suggesting that the multimerization of Vif proteins could be important for Vif function in the viral life cycle. Our studies identified a new feature of Vif and should accelerate our understanding of its role in HIV-1 pathogenesis."
712,0.001,1.0000,"Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a common chronic inflammatory disorder sometimes associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

The study comprised four groups: 14 patients with OLP and HCV infection. 14 HCV-seronegative patients with OLP, 21 HCV-seropositive patients without OLP and 18 healthy controls. We found a significant association between the concomitance of OLP and HCV infection and the presence of such antibodies.

6514,0.001,1.0000,"Alcohol-antiretroviral therapy (ART) interactive toxicity beliefs reflect perceived adverse outcomes of mixing alcohol and ART. Previous research has shown a significant relationship between alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and ART non-adherence, over and above other correlates of non-adherence such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)symptoms and frequency of alcohol use. Most past studies have collected data over extended periods and have not determined if alcohol use and missed medications occur at the day-level among people holding interactive toxicity beliefs. Previous daily analyses, however, have been limited by self-reported adherence and relatively short periods of observation. To address these gaps in the literature, men and women living with HIV in Atlanta, GA, were enrolled in a 45-day observational cohort study. Daily alcohol use was collected using two-way interactive text message surveys and daily adherence was collected via the Wisepill device. Fifty-seven participants completed a measure of alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and contributed 2565 days of daily data. Participants who endorsed high levels of interactive toxicity beliefs had significantly more days when they missed doses of medication. Alcohol-antiretroviral toxicity beliefs predicted missing doses of medication on days when participants were drinking and on days when they were not drinking. Multilevel multivariate regressions showed that these toxicity beliefs predicted daily missed doses of medication over and above quantity of alcohol consumed, depression and general medication concerns. This study replicates and extends previous literature and indicates the necessity of addressing alcohol-ART toxicity beliefs within adherence interventions."
345,0.001,1.0000,"Adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is generally high in most resource-limited settings. However, sub-optimal adherence occurs in a sizable proportion of patients, and is independently predictive of detectable viremia. We investigated sub-optimal adherence according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill assessment methods, and their associated factors among HIV-infected adults receiving cART in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Eight-hundred seventy patients who initiated cART between May 2009 and April 2012 were randomly selected, and 664 patients who were alive, had remained in clinical care and were receiving cART for at least six-months were included. Sub-optimal adherence was defined as patients' response of less than ""all-of the time"" to the self-report adherence question, or any clinician-recorded poor adherence during the six most recent clinic visits, or a pharmacy-refill of <95% medication possession ratio (MPR). Logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with sub-optimal adherence. The average adherence level to cART, expressed as MPR, was nearly 97%. However, sub-optimal adherence occurred in 12%, 4%, and 27% of patients according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill measures, respectively. More satisfaction with social support was significantly associated with less sub-optimal adherence according to self-report and clinician-record. Younger age, lower educational level, and lower CD4 cell count at cART initiation were significantly associated with sub-optimal refill-based adherence. Findings from our large multi-center study suggest that sub-optimal adherence was present in up to a quarter of the patients, despite a high degree of average adherence to cART. Interventions aimed at preventing sub-optimal adherence should focus on improving social support, on younger patients, on patients with lower educational level, and on those who started cART at a lower CD4 cell count."
5443,0.001,1.0000,"In patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), there are some well-known tumor-related adverse prognostic factors that may increase the mortality rate. However, secondary factors such as viral hepatitis carriers that may decrease the cure rates are usually ignored. Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients undergoing cytotoxic treatment for NHL is a well-known complication. Charts of 112 patients with NHL were retrospectively analyzed regarding their hepatitis serology, the indirect effects of seropositivity on disease outcome, and the precautions undertaken in these seropositive patients with NHL. Twelve patients (11%) with HBsAg positivity and two patients (1.7%) with antibody to hepatitis C virus positivity were detected. Eight out of 12 patients (67%) with HBsAg positivity and two patients (50%) with anti-HCV positivity showed reactivation of hepatitis during treatment of NHL. No reactivation was detected in four patients seropositive for HBV, who were given lamivudine prophylaxis before the initiation of chemotherapy schedules. Among patients with hepatitis reactivation, two were treated with lamivudine resulting in dramatic improvement and clinical remission of the disease. The remaining six patients with reactivation were left untreated, resulting in four deaths (67%) due to liver failure secondary to HBV and two deaths secondary to delayed treatment of NHL. One patient seropositive for anti-HCV also developed chronic hepatitis C. Determination of hepatitis serology in all patients with NHL before any chemotherapy administration is crucial, but insufficient, if not taken into consideration. In seropositive patients, HBV DNA should be determined and antiviral prophylaxis with lamivudine should be initiated before any treatment."
5841,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) continues to be an important public health problem worldwide, including in the United States. An algorithm for managing CHB was developed by a panel of United States hepatologists in 2004 and subsequently updated in 2006 and 2008. Since 2008, additional data on long-term safety and efficacy of licensed therapies have become available and have better defined therapeutic options for CHB. The evidence indicates that potent antiviral therapy can lead to regression of extensive fibrosis or even cirrhosis, thus potentially altering the natural history of CHB. In addition, appropriate choice of antiviral agent can minimize the risk of resistance. This updated algorithm for managing CHB is based primarily on evidence from the scientific literature. Where data were lacking, the panel relied on clinical experience and consensus expert opinion. The primary aim of antiviral therapy for CHB is durable suppression of serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA to low or undetectable levels. CHB patients who have HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL, elevated alanine aminotransferase level, and any degree of fibrosis should receive antiviral therapy regardless of their hepatitis B e antigen status. CHB patients with HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL and elevated alanine aminotransferase level but no evidence of fibrosis may also be considered for antiviral therapy. Approved antiviral therapies for CHB are interferon alfa-2b, peginterferon alfa-2a, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir, although the preferred first-line treatment choices are peginterferon alfa-2a, entecavir, and tenofovir. In determining choice of therapy, considerations include efficacy, safety, rate of resistance, method of administration, duration, and cost. "
7049,0.001,1.0000,"Recent advances in HIV-1 pathogenesis, and in defining virological and immunological responses to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), along with the identification of the numerous drawbacks of HAART, have clearly demonstrated that the eradication of the virus is not a feasible therapeutic goal, and that there is an urgent need to develop other approaches to fight HIV-1 infection. Novel therapeutic approaches of immune modulation have recently been evaluated in pilot clinical trials. First, treating primary HIV-1 infection with cyclosporin A (CsA) coupled with HAART to target massive immune activation extends the benefits achieved with HAART during primary HIV-1 infection and might contribute to the establishment of a more favourable immunological set-point affecting the ultimate pattern and rate of disease progression. Second, treating chronic HIV-1 infection in patients with long-term suppression of virus replication induced by HAART, with the addition of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) reduces the pool of activated CD4+ T lymphocytes able to support productive HIV-1 infection, and might have an indirect impact on the pool of resting, latently infected CD4+ T cells, contributing to its depletion in vivo. The important question is clearly whether these results will have an impact on the clinical management of patients with HIV-1 infection, determining the precise therapeutic function of drugs like CsA and MMF, thus investigating the effects of these drugs on residual viral replication and the decay of the latent reservoir, on long-term immunological benefit, and, ultimately, on clinical benefit."

Several studies have shown that, in patients with genotype 1 (GT-1), rs12979860 C/C and rs8099917 T/T substitutions are associated with a more than twofold increase in sustained virological response rate to Peg-IFN and RBV treatment. Although new treatment regimens based on combination of DAA with or without IFN are in the approval phase, until combination regimens with a backbone of Peg-IFN will be used, we can expect that IL28B holds its importance. The clinical relevance of IL28B genotyping in treatment of patients infected with HCV genotype 2 (GT-2) and 3 (GT-3) remains controversial. Therefore, after a careful examination of the available literature, we analyzed the impact of IL28B in GT-2 and -3. Simple size of the studies and GT-2 and GT-3 proportion were discussed. An algorithm for the practical use of IL28B in these patients was suggested at the aim of optimizing treatment. "

Questionnaires were returned by 124 orthodontists (56% response rate) and 126 general dentists (61% response rate). Eighteen questions were asked covering practice profile, perception of risk from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), exposure to blood, barrier protection used, and sterilization and disinfection procedures. Gloves always were worn by 80% of the orthodontists sampled, 63% always wore glasses, and 59% changed gloves between patients. Orthodontists sterilized their instruments 66% of the time and pliers 49% of the time. Compared with general dentists, orthodontists' perception of risk, use of barrier protection, and sterilization and disinfection procedures were lower in all areas. Our data suggest that poorer performance may be because orthodontists: (1) perceive their younger population of patients at less risk for HBV and HIV; (2) treat 2.5 times as many patients, which increases the costs of infection control; (3) do not use invasive procedures; and (4) perceive that glove use decreases dexterity. Orthodontists should follow the American Dental Association/Council on Dental Therapeutics infection control guidelines for universal precautions. To meet these guidelines, orthodontists still need improvement in all aspects of their infection control procedures."
7829,0.001,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic continues to grow at an alarming rate, with a further 5 million new infections in 2003. Some 3.5 million of these were in sub-Saharan Africa, where approximately 70% of the world's HIV-positive population resides. In contrast, the spread of HIV in high-income countries has slowed since its discovery in the 1980s, and in regions such as Western Europe prevalence has decreased. Here, we employ coalescent methods to compare the epidemic growth rates of two subtypes of HIV-1 with differing epidemiological profiles: subtype C, which is dominant in sub-Saharan Africa and associated with heterosexual transmission, and subtype B, the main cause of AIDS in Western Europe and North America, and which was primarily transmitted through homosexual sex and injecting drug use. We show that although both subtypes emerged at approximately the same time ( approximately 1960), they have widely differing patterns of exponential population growth. At its current growth rate the epidemic of subtype C in sub-Saharan Africa is doubling every 2.4 years, which is approximately half the rate observed during the early stages of the subtype B epidemic in Western Europe and North America. However, the subtype C growth rate is still 5-10 times greater than that estimated for the blood-borne hepatitis C virus, supporting the hypothesis that sexual transmission has been primarily responsible for the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa."

After specificity and sensitivity testing, three new rapid diagnostic test kits were tested in parallel with six commonly used diagnostic test kits. The Determine HIV-1/2 test had fewer indeterminate or equivocal results than the Capillus HIV-1/HIV-2 or HIV Blot 2.2 tests. However, the Determine HIV-1/2 test yielded one false-positive result when compared with the Serodia HIV, HIV Blot 2.2, and microparticle enzyme immunoassay (IMx) HIV tests. The Serodia HBsAg test yielded more false-negative results when compared with the Determine HBsAg diagnostic test kit. The results of the syphilis diagnostic tests evaluated in this clinical trial consistently agreed with those of the rapid plasma reagin test for syphilis. The Determine Syphilis Treponema pallidum (TP) test had three false-positive results compared with the Serodia TP and the Serodia TP x particle agglutination (PA) tests, which had two false-positive results that were confirmed as negative by an ELISA. Application of these serologic tests within this comparative evaluation framework, using the World Health Organization alternative testing strategies, proved to be an effective way to determine serostatus related to HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis."

Of 308 active FMC patients, 266 underwent HBsAg serology testing within the period of study. The HBsAg coinfection prevalence was 5.3% (14/266); 2 of 252 patients had at least one positive antihepatitis C IgG serology, a 0.8% prevalence. Hepatitis B coinfection is relatively common in HIV-infected adults at our center in Botswana, whereas hepatitis C coinfection is rare. In this setting, where the diagnosis of hepatitis B coinfection with HIV has implications for choice of first-line antiretroviral therapy and prevention of perinatal hepatitis B transmission, broader sampling to establish the true population prevalence of hepatitis B coinfection and the desirability of adding screening to HIV management should be considered. These findings provide little justification for adding hepatitis C coinfection screening to the management of HIV infection in Botswana."

Children (n = 21) with zidovudine-resistant virus had greater evidence of disease progression than did those with zidovudine-sensitive virus (n = 11) as demonstrated by failure to thrive (57% vs. 9%, P = .01) and opportunistic infections (48% vs. 0, P = .006). This assay may be useful as a screening tool for development of clinically relevant zidovudine resistance."
9306,0.001,1.0000,"The treatment costs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients continue to rise as patients survive longer because of advances in antiretroviral therapy and effective chemoprophylaxis. Medication costs per patient increase in proportion to progressive immunodeficiency. We retrospectively studied medication costs for 196 HIV-infected patients with stratification by CD4-lymphocyte count. Medication costs per patient-month were correlated with CD4-lymphocyte count (linear regression, r = -.53, P < 0.01), with higher costs associated with lower CD4 counts. The medication cost for patients with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3 averaged $1043 per month. Medication costs per patient increase with the development of each new opportunistic infection or other AIDS-associated condition. Costs can be expected to increase as new therapeutic agents are introduced, as treatment is initiated at earlier stages of HIV infection, and as more patients survive to the point of severe CD4-lymphocyte depletion."

In combination with other proven HIV-prevention methods, preexposure prophylaxis may be a useful tool for women at the highest risk of HIV acquisition. Obstetrician-gynecologists involved in the care of women using preexposure prophylaxis must reinforce adherence to daily medication. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance for preexposure prophylaxis is likely to evolve in the coming years, and obstetrician-gynecologists should remain aware of new developments in this area. Risk reduction for all women at risk of HIV infection should include counseling about testing, safe-sex practices (including condom use), and other behavioral interventions."
3312,0.001,1.0000,"In the absence of antiretroviral therapy, valacyclovir may reduce HIV viral load and increase CD4+ T-lymphocyte count. We sought to evaluate the impact of valacyclovir on HIV and HSV-2 in co-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy with previously unrecognised HSV-2 infection. A prospective, randomised-controlled, 24-week trial of valacyclovir 1000 mg was performed. Mean CD4+ T-lymphocyte count at 24 weeks compared to baseline CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was the primary outcome. HIV viral load suppression, HSV-2 outbreaks and asymptomatic HSV-2 shedding were secondary outcomes. Participants were randomised to valacyclovir (N = 66) or placebo (N = 35). Study completion was 64%. There was no change in 24 weeks compared to baseline CD4+ T-lymphocyte count in either group (valacyclovir p = 0.91, placebo p = 0.59) or the proportion with HIV viral load suppression (valacyclovir p = 0.75, placebo p = 1.0). Genital HSV and asymptomatic HSV-2 shedding were rare. Valacyclovir had no effect on CD4+ T-lymphocyte count or HIV viral load in this population. Valacyclovir may reduce clinical outbreaks and asymptomatic HSV-2 shedding, but the rarity of these events, along with its lack of benefit on HIV, does not support its use in this clinical setting. "
3643,0.001,1.0000,"In a retrospective study of 648 persons with HIV infection in Cambodia, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to start antiretroviral treatment based on clinical criteria alone or based on a combination of clinical symptoms and the total lymphocyte count. As a reference test, we used the 2003 WHO criteria, including the CD4 count. The 2003 WHO clinical criteria had a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 57%, and an accuracy of 89% to identify patients who need highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In our clinic, with a predominance of patients with advanced disease, the 2003 WHO clinical criteria alone was a good predictor of those needing HAART. A total lymphocyte count as an extra criterion did not improve the accuracy. Nine percent of patients were wrongly identified to be in need of HAART. Among them, almost 50% had a CD4 count of more than 500 cells/muL, and 73% had weight loss of more than 10% as a stage-defining condition. Our data suggest that, in settings with limited access to CD4 count testing, it might be useful to target this test to patients in WHO stage 3 whose staging is based on weight loss alone, to avoid unnecessary treatment."
2628,0.001,1.0000,"In the era of antiretroviral therapy, HIV infection has become a chronic illness with associated multimorbidity, and practitioners are faced with an emerging population of HIV-infected patients with evolving needs for advance care planning (ACP), defined as communication between individuals and their proxies to plan for future health care decisions. This article provides a review of original research studies on ACP in HIV-infected adults in the era of antiretroviral therapy (1996-present) from PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Eleven studies conducted between 1996 and 2015 met the selection criteria, with study sizes ranging from 9 to 2864 participants. Most studies consisted of white men in outpatient settings and had poorly defined definitions of ACP. Prevalence of ACP was variable (36%-54% had end-of-life communication, 8%-47% had advance directives). Lack of ACP was most commonly associated with low income, followed by lower severity of illness, low education level, black or Hispanic race, female sex, younger age, injection drug use, and social isolation. Practitioners reported limited time or energy and inadequate preparation or training as barriers to ACP. Existing literature on ACP in the era of antiretroviral therapy is limited, but shows that ACP prevalence in HIV-infected individuals is variable depending on socioeconomic factors, severity of illness, and practitioner resources and training. More research is needed to increase ACP among HIV-infected individuals. "

This patient population, however, has relatively poor HBV vaccine responses. Factors associated with this impaired HBV vaccine response in HIV-infected individuals may include older age, uncontrolled HIV replication, and low nadir CD4 cell count. Postvaccination testing for HBV surface antibody is recommended and vaccine non-responders should undergo repeat immunization with a full series. The benefit of double dosage, the appropriate strategy for HIV-infected patients with isolated HBV core antibody and the timing and number of vaccinations in persons with advanced immunosuppression on highly active antiretroviral therapy remain controversial areas."
252,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1 infection is associated with B-cell abnormalities, such as hypergammaglobulinemia, poor immunization responses, and loss of serologic memory. To determine whether altered expression of chemokine receptors and their ligands may play a role in B-cell dysfunctions during HIV-1 infection, the expression of CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), CXCR5, and CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and their respective ligands on CD19(+) B cells were examined in HIV-1-infected patients and controls. We report a decreased CXCR5 expression on B cells from patients (P < .05), a phenomenon associated with a low CD4 T-cell count (< 350 cells/microL). Interestingly, an increased expression of CXC chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13), the ligand for CXCR5, was found in peripheral B cells from HIV-1-infected patients. Moreover, on B-cell activation in vitro, CXCL13 was secreted in culture. CXCL13(+) B cells were also found in the lymph nodes of HIV-1-infected patients, but not in control tissue. B-cell migration toward CXCL13, CXCL12, and CC chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21), ligands for CXCR5, CXCR4, and CCR7 was also evaluated. In patients with a low CD4 T-cell count, migration toward all ligands was increased. Our findings indicate that altered expression of the chemokine receptor-ligand pair, CXCR5/CXCL13, may participate in the establishment of B-cell dysfunctions during HIV-1 infection."
945,0.001,1.0000,"The growing elderly population of HIV-infected patients is leading to a significant epidemiological transition and HIV infection has been proposed as a premature and accelerated aging model rending the individual more susceptible to premature disability. However, the determinants of disability among this emergent population are still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the correlates of prevalent disability in adults ≥50 years with HIV infection. A cross-sectional study of 184 HIV-infected adults receiving ambulatory care in an HIV clinic of a tertiary care, university-affiliated hospital in Mexico City was conducted. Disability for instrumental (IADL) and basic activities of daily living (ADL) was established. Sociodemographic factors, clinical variables, current CD4(+) cell count, and HIV viral load (VL) were tested as potential determinants of disability. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the correlates of both types of disability. The mean age was 59.3 years. All participants were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Of participants 17.9% had disability for IADL and 26.1% for ADL. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that being older; having a lower CD4(+) cell count, and having a detectable HIV VL were independently associated with both types of disability. In addition, educational level was also independently associated with ADL disability. Age, educational level, low CD4(+) cell count, and detectable HIV VL were independently associated with disability. Whether effective and timely antiretroviral therapy will reduce the risk of disability in HIV-infected elderly patients needs to be evaluated. "
4480,0.001,1.0000,"Through this study we evaluated whether the HIV-1 tropism determined by genotypic analysis correlates with HIV-1 markers, such as CD4 cell count and plasma HIV-RNA. The analysis was performed on 1221 HIV-1 B-subtype infected patients with an available V3 sequence (all maraviroc naive). Of them, 532 were antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive and 689 ART experienced. Tropism determination was performed by using the geno2pheno (co-receptor) algorithm set at a false-positive rate (FPR) of 10% and 2%. Potential associations of FPR with CD4 cell count and viraemia were evaluated. Association of V3 mutations with genotypic-determined tropism was also evaluated according to different FPR ranges. About 26% of patients (either ART naive or ART experienced) were infected by X4-tropic viruses (using the classical 10% FPR cut-off). However, a significantly lower proportion of ART-naive patients had FPR ≤ 2% in comparison with ART-experienced patients (4.9% vs. 12.6%, respectively, p <0.001). The risk of advanced HIV-1 infection (with CD4 cell count ≤ 200 cells/mm(3)) was significantly greater in X4-infected patients, either ART-naive (OR (95% CI)), 4.2 (1.8-9.2); p 0.0006) or ART-experienced (2.3 (1.4-3.6); p 0.0003), with FPR set at 2% (but not at 10%). This finding was confirmed by multivariable logistic analysis. No relationship was found between viraemia and FPR ≤2%. Some X4-related mutations were significantly associated with FPR ≤2% (ART-naive patients, S11R, Y21V, G24K and G24R, p ≤0.001; ART-experienced patients, Y7K, S11R, H13Y, p ≤0.002). In conclusion, these findings show that within the context of genotypically-assessed CXCR4 tropism, FPR ≤2% defines (far better than 10%-FPR) a viral population associated with low CD4 rank, with potentially greater cytopathic effect, and with more advanced disease."

3522,0.001,1.0000,"In 1990 the results of a placebo-controlled study conducted within the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG 019) showed that in the short term, zidovudine was effective in slowing progression to advanced disease in HIV-infected asymptomatic patients with low CD4 cell counts. More recently, the preliminary results of the Concorde Trial suggested that while the data at 1 year agreed with those of ACTG 019, no sustained clinical benefit was detectable at 3 years for early versus deferred therapy. Therefore, the length of the clinical usefulness of zidovudine in this population is still to be determined. We evaluated the 2-year outcome of zidovudine therapy in asymptomatic patients through the prospective follow-up of a cohort of 936 subjects with low CD4+ (< 500/mm3) counts who strictly satisfied, at enrollment, the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the ACTG 019 trial. The clinical end point of the analysis was the development of AIDS. The majority (72.2%) of the individuals in the cohort acquired HIV infection through intravenous drug use; 26.6% were women. The median baseline CD4 cell count was 308/mm3. At 55 weeks of mean follow-up, the progression rate to AIDS (3.2 events per hundred person-years) appears to be comparable to that already reported at the same mean follow-up time for the ACTG 019 zidovudine-treated asymptomatic patients.

Protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding regions were analyzed in DNA samples obtained from 100 HIV-1-infected individuals. Primary resistance mutations to RT inhibitors were identified in 26% of patients treated with these drugs. Transmission of HIV-1-resistant strains was detected in a drug-naive patient (3%). Primary resistance mutations to protease inhibitors (PIs) were present in 9% of the 44 PI-treated patients and in 1 PI-naive individual. Phylogenetic analysis of these samples has resulted in the most extensive survey, to date, of HIV-1 genetic forms circulating in Venezuela. Ninety-nine samples clustered with subtype B, and 1 individual harbored the first B/F recombinant virus reported in Venezuela, with protease clustering with subtype F and RT with subtype B. In addition, this isolate had a new insertion (Glu-34 duplication) in the protease gene."
4233,0.001,1.0000,"In order to assess the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance mutation profiles and evaluate the distribution of the genetic subtypes in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, blood samples from 547 HIV-1 infected patients failing antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, were collected during the years 2002 and 2003 to perform the viral resistance genotyping at the Renageno Laboratory from Rio de Janeiro (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation). Viral resistance genotyping was performed using ViroSeq Genotyping System (Celera Diagnostic-Abbott, US). The HIV-1 subtyping based on polymerase (pol) gene sequences (protease and reverse transcriptase-RT regions) was as follows: subtype B (91.2%), subtype F (4.9%), and B/F viral recombinant forms (3.3%). The subtype C was identified in two patients (0.4%) and the recombinant CRF_02/AG virus was found infecting one patient (0.2%). The HIV-1 genotyping profile associated to the reverse transcriptase inhibitors has shown a high frequency of the M184V mutation followed by the timidine-associated mutations. The K103N mutation was the most prevalent to the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor and the resistance associated to protease inhibitor showed the minor mutations L63P, L10F/R, and A71V as the more prevalent. A large proportion of subtype B was observed in HIV-1 treated patients from Rio de Janeiro. In addition, we have identified the circulation of drug-resistant HIV-1 subtype C and are presenting the first report of the occurrence of an African recombinant CRF_02/AG virus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A clear association between HIV-1 subtypes and protease resistance mutations was observed in this study. The maintenance of resistance genotyping programs for HIV-1 failing patients is important to the management of ARV therapies and to attempt and monitor the HIV-1 subtype prevalence in Brazil."
7273,0.001,1.0000,"The use of all potent drugs is associated with toxicities and antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are no exception. Antiretroviral therapy-associated hepatic toxicity is of increasing concern in the management of patients with HIV/AIDS. Liver toxicity has been reported in some HIV-infected patients being treated with drugs from all of these classes of ARV drugs: protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Although the majority of cases involve asymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), severe, and, in a minority of cases, life threatening, liver disease has been reported in patients treated with ARV drugs. The exact causes of elevated plasma levels of AST and ALT are complex and, in many cases, obscure. The combination of viral hepatic disease, drugs that act adversely directly on the liver and drugs that act on other systems of the body which in turn, adversely affect the liver, can result in hepatic toxicity. Such toxicity may be inappropriately attributed solely to the direct effect of a drug. Knowledge of the possible causes of liver toxicity, and ways to avoid it, should reduce the risk of developing hepatotoxicity. The physician's task is to prevent the development of liver toxicity, e.g., by choosing appropriate therapeutic regimens and by careful management of the patient. This involves frequent monitoring of the patient, both clinically and by utilizing liver function tests on a regular basis. If signs and symptoms of liver disease do develop, prompt and expert management is essential. This review discusses the influence of a number of factors on hepatic toxicity including viral hepatitis, insulin resistance and the specific ARV drugs used in the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS."
640,0.001,1.0000,"The main failure of antiretroviral therapy is the lack of restoration of HIV-specific CD4(+) T cells. IL-7, which has been shown to be a crucial cytokine for thymopoiesis, has been envisaged as an additive therapeutic strategy. However, in vitro studies suggest that IL-7 might sustain HIV replication in thymocytes and T lymphocytes. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the effect of IL-7 on both T cell renewal and viral load in SIVmac-infected young macaques in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. This evaluation was conducted during the asymptomatic phase in view of a potential treatment of HIV patients. We show that IL-7 induces both a central renewal and a peripheral expansion of T lymphocytes associated with cell activation. No alarming modulation of the other hemopoietic cells was observed. No increase in the viral load was shown in blood or lymph nodes. These data strengthen the rationale for the use of IL-7 as an efficient immunotherapy in AIDS."
8228,0.001,1.0000,"The antiviral activity of a CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone (TCC108) directed against a newly identified HLA-B14-restricted epitope, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev(67-75) SAEPVPLQL, was analyzed with respect to its kinetics of target cell lysis and inhibition of HIV-1 production. Addition of TCC108 cells or CD8(+) reverse transcriptase-specific CTLs to HLA-matched CD4(+) T cells at different times after infection with HIV-1 IIIB showed that infected cells became susceptible to CTL-mediated lysis before peak virus production but after the onset of progeny virus release. When either of these CTLs were added to part of the infected cells immediately after infection, p55 expression and virus production were significantly suppressed. These data support a model in which CTLs, apart from exerting cytolytic activity which may prevent continued virus release, can interfere with viral protein expression during the eclipse phase via noncytolytic mechanisms. TCC108-mediated inhibition of virus replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells caused rapid selection of a virus with a mutation (69E-->K) in the Rev(67-75) CTL epitope which abolished recognition by TCC108 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that both cytolytic and noncytolytic antiviral mechanisms of CTLs can be specifically targeted to HIV-1-infected cells."

TDRMs were detected in 19/408 (5%) volunteers. The prevalence of TDRMs varied by research center, from 5/26 (19%) in Entebbe, 6/78 (8%) in Kigali, 2/49 (4%) in Kilifi, to 3/106 (3%) in Lusaka. One of five volunteers from Cape Town (20%) had TDRMs. Despite small numbers, our data suggest an increase in DRMs by year of infection in Zambia (p = 0.004). The prevalence observed in Entebbe was high across the entire study. ARV history data from 12 (63%) HIV-infected sexual partners were available; 3 reported ARV use prior to transmission. Among four partners with sequence data available, transmission linkage was confirmed and two had the same TDRMs as the newly infected volunteer (both K103N). As ARV therapy continues to increase in availability throughout Africa, monitoring incident virus strains for the presence of TDRMs should be a priority. Early HIV infection cohorts provide an excellent and important platform to monitor the development of TDRMs to inform treatment guidelines, drug choices, and strategies for secondary prevention of TDRM transmission."

This substudy evaluated the emergence of nevirapine-resistance mutations at 6 weeks postpartum in a subgroup of participants. Maternal risk factors for the emergence of nevirapine-resistance mutations were evaluated. Mutations associated with nevirapine resistance were detectable at delivery, prior to receipt of study drug, in 5 (2.3%) of 217 women. Fourteen (15%; 95% confidence interval, 8%-23%) of 95 women who received intrapartum nevirapine developed a nevirapine-resistance mutation 6 weeks postpartum. The most common mutation was K103N, which was present in 10 women. The risk for development of a new nevirapine-resistance mutation did not correlate with CD4 cell count or HIV-1 RNA load at delivery or with type of antepartum antiretroviral therapy. The risk of nevirapine resistance should be considered when determining the risks or benefits of intrapartum nevirapine in women receiving antepartum antiretroviral therapy."

Apoptosis was induced in a minority of CD4 but not CD8 positive cells with a statistically significant increase in cytolytic T-cell activity. In the 24 week clinical trial in 7 HIV-1 infected patients, three who had rapidly rising viral loads prior to initiating therapy stabilized. Two had a sustained greater than 0.5 log decrement and 5 had stable plasma viral loads (less than a 0.5 log increment or decrement) with varied effects on absolute CD4 and CD8 positive lymphocytes counts. One achieved a greater than 1 log decrement in HIV-1 plasma viral load and undetectable in vivo cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 infectivity with an increased in vitro lymphocyte mitogen stimulation index. Under amended protocol, 5 additional 12 month courses were administered to three additional patients and two of the previous enrollees.

ZDV treatment (30 mg/kg/day via continuous subcutaneous infusion) was initiated 48 h prior to virus inoculation and continued for 28 days. Transient plasma antigenemia evident in six of six untreated cats at week 2 post-inoculation (pi) was absent in the ZDV-treated cats although at 10 and 14 weeks pi (6 and 10 weeks after drug treatment), one of the ZDV-treated cats had low-level antigenemia. Both CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte numbers were consistently higher in the ZDV-treated cats when compared to both the FIV-inoculated untreated cats and the virus-naive, age-matched controls. CD4:CD8 ratios were lower for the ZDV-treated cats than either the FIV-inoculated untreated or virus-naive, control cats. The decreased CD4:CD8 ratios were the result of an increase in CD8 lymphocytes in the ZDV-treated cats while decreased ratios in the FIV-inoculated untreated cats were due to cell loss. Both ZDV-treated and untreated cats showed nearly identical FIV-specific antibody responses beginning 2 weeks pi. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results from blood lymphocytes showed that six of six ZDV-treated and six of six untreated cats were positive for FIV-specific gag sequences. Although primary infection was not prevented, these results suggest that prophylactic ZDV therapy deterred early systemic spread of infection mediated by viremia and delayed absolute CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte decline."

This work extends other recently published studies of the same group of HIV-1(+) vaccinated patients, which demonstrated that the viral load significantly decreases and correlates inversely with an increase in HIV-specific T-cell responses in vaccinated patients, but not in controls who received placebo. Our results indicate that this vaccine raises the level of the NK CD56(neg) cell subpopulation, while levels of the NK CD56(dim) and NK CD56(bright) cells expressing the inhibitory receptor CD85j/ILT-2 fell in vaccinated patients.

8787,0.001,1.0000,Nineteen patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with varying levels of viral suppression achieved with antiretroviral therapy were evaluated to determine whether trivalent influenza vaccine activated HIV replication. Humoral immune responses and CD4+ lymphocyte subsets were compared in 5 HIV-uninfected vaccinated subjects. Transient elevations of plasma HIV RNA levels (76-89 copies/mL) appeared within 2 weeks in 3 of 11 patients with <50 copies/mL at baseline. Sustained elevation in HIV plasma RNA was observed in 7 of 8 patients with baseline HIV RNA of >50 copies/mL. HIV DNA decreased in patients with <400 RNA copies/mL at baseline and showed an HIV RNA increase after vaccination (n=8) when compared with 8 patients with <50 copies/mL at baseline who lacked viral response to vaccination. Concurrent decreases in proviral DNA and memory phenotype CD4+ cells in association with increased plasma HIV RNA after vaccination in patients with <400 RNA copies/mL at baseline suggest that in vivo mobilization of the latently infected cell reservoir may occur during potent antiretroviral therapy.
5726,0.001,1.0000,"For most HIV-infected patients, antiretroviral therapy controls viral replication. However, in some patients drug resistance can cause therapy to fail. Nonetheless, continued therapy with a failing regimen can preserve or even lead to increases in CD4+ T cell counts. To understand the biological basis of these observations, we used mathematical models to explain observations made in patients with drug-resistant HIV treated with enfuvirtide (ENF/T-20), an HIV-1 fusion inhibitor. Due to resistance emergence, ENF was removed from the drug regimen, drug-sensitive virus regrown, and ENF was re-administered. We used our model to study the dynamics of plasma-viral RNA and CD4+ T cell levels, and the competition between drug-sensitive and resistant viruses during therapy interruption and re-administration. Focusing on resistant viruses carrying the V38A mutation in gp41, we found ENF-resistant virus to be 17±3% less fit than ENF-sensitive virus in the absence of the drug, and that the loss of resistant virus during therapy interruption was primarily due to this fitness cost. Using viral dynamic parameters estimated from these patients, we show that although re-administration of ENF cannot suppress viral load, it can, in the presence of resistant virus, increase CD4+ T cell counts, which should yield clinical benefits. This study provides a framework to investigate HIV and T cell dynamics in patients who develop drug resistance to other antiretroviral agents and may help to develop more effective strategies for treatment."

IDUs who use mobile health care services linked to a syringe exchange program in New Haven were routinely screened for HBV, hepatitis C virus, and syphilis. Individuals without prior exposure to HBV were offered three-part vaccination series. Of the 212 IDUs screened for HBV infection, 134 (63%) were eligible (negative for HBV surface and core anti-bodies) for vaccination and 10 (4.7%) had evidence of chronic HBV infection. Compared to those with previous exposure to HBV, vaccine-eligible patients were significantly more likely to be younger and use heroin and less likely to be black, home-less, daily injectors, and cocaine users. Of the 134 vaccine-eligible subjects, 103 (77%) and 89 (66%) completed two and three vaccinations, respectively. Correlates of completing all three vaccinations included older age (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.04-1.07), injecting daily (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.36-6.73), and being homeless (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.14-12.27). These results suggest that IDUs remain at high risk for acquiring HBV infection. Programs that link health care to a syringe exchange program are effective ways to provide preventive health care services to IDUs, particularly HBV vaccination. Trust engendered by and mutual respect afforded by such programs result in repeated encounters by active IDUs over time."

Apart from these essential functions prerequisite for the life cycle of AAV, these rep products are able to inhibit the replication and gene expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and a number of DNA viruses. Here, it is demonstrated that Rep78, as a chimeric with the maltose binding protein, directly binds the full-length HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), and to a subset of these sequences containing the trans-activation response (TAR) sequence as DNA. These interactions, an effector protein physically binding a target promoter, suggest a direct mechanism of action for Rep78 inhibition. Furthermore, competitive binding studies between the TAR region and the full-length HIV-LTR, strongly suggested that another site(s) within the LTR was also bound by Rep78. Finally, as Rep78 binding is also believed to be affected by secondary structure within the DNA, it was found that Rep78 preferentially binds with HIV-LTR sequences with promoted secondary structure generated by heat denaturation and rapid cooling."
3219,0.001,1.0000,"Unprotected sexual intercourse between individuals who are both infected with HIV-1 can lead to exposure to their partner's virus, and potentially to super-infection. However, the immunological consequences of continued exposure to HIV-1 by individuals already infected, has to our knowledge never been reported. We measured T cell responses in 49 HIV-1 infected individuals who were on antiretroviral therapy with suppressed viral loads. All the individuals were in a long-term sexual partnership with another HIV-1 infected individual, who was either also on HAART and suppressing their viral loads, or viremic (>9000 copies/ml). T cell responses to HIV-1 epitopes were measured directly ex-vivo by the IFN-gamma enzyme linked immuno-spot assay and by cytokine flow cytometry. Sexual exposure data was generated from questionnaires given to both individuals within each partnership. Individuals who continued to have regular sexual contact with a HIV-1 infected viremic partner had significantly higher frequencies of HIV-1-specific T cell responses, compared to individuals with aviremic partners. Strikingly, the magnitude of the HIV-1-specific T cell response correlated strongly with the level and route of exposure. Responses consisted of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subsets. Longitudinally, decreases in exposure were mirrored by a lower T cell response. However, no evidence for systemic super-infection was found in any of the individuals. Continued sexual exposure to exogenous HIV-1 was associated with increased HIV-1-specific T cell responses, in the absence of systemic super-infection, and correlated with the level and type of exposure."

Participants completed a patient satisfaction survey following the 12 part intervention consisting of seven groups and five individual sessions. A feedback questionnaire was also completed during each group session to gain more insight on participant experiences. Several indicators suggested high levels of satisfaction. First, overall attendance was relatively high. Second, participants rated their subjective experience and group content favorably. No differences in satisfaction ratings emerged between perinatally infected adolescents and those who acquired HIV through risk behaviors. However, differences emerged regarding perceived intervention utility and content-specific preferences. Findings suggest that Adolescent Impact participants were satisfied with the intervention and that a heterogeneous group of HIV-infected youth could be advantageously integrated into the same secondary prevention program."

HIV and AIDS have a special impact on working-age populations, economic resources, certain illnesses, and health care facilities. Assessment of HIV serostatus of hospitalized patients is rarely performed, however, because of a reluctance to intrude on patient confidentiality, a perceived lack of benefit (no antiretroviral therapy is available), and societal denial. We evaluated the effect on health care of HIV testing of patients routinely admitted to medical wards in the 2 major city hospitals in Harare, Zimbabwe. Of 196 patients tested, 58% were HIV positive with strong associations with infectious diseases, and with youth and weight loss, but not with cardiac, pulmonary, endocrinologic, or renal diagnoses, and not with rural versus urban location, occupation, sex, mortality, or cost of hospitalization. The clinical estimate of patients' HIV serostatus was largely inaccurate. Mandatory HIV testing of all hospitalized patients would improve diagnosis of infectious diseases, clarify patient prognosis, allow for individual counseling with regard to HIV prevention, and focus national health efforts by providing alarming, realistic statistics."

Understanding patient medication adherence behaviors and challenges could inform adherence interventions to maximize the individual and prevention benefits of ART. This study assessed recent nonadherence and treatment interruption among 813 HIV-infected adult outpatients in Guangzhou, China. Participants completed a behavioral survey, underwent chart review, and were tested for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Factors associated with suboptimal adherence were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Among 721 HIV-infected adults receiving ART, 18.9% reported recent nonadherence (any missed ART in the past four weeks) and 6.8% reported treatment interruption (four or more weeks of missed ART in the past year). Lower education, living alone, alcohol use, and being on ART one to three years were associated with recent nonadherence. Male gender, lower education, and being on ART one to three years were associated with treatment interruption. ART medication adherence interventions are needed in China that include individualized, long-term adherence plans sensitive to patients' educational and economic situations. These interventions should also consider possible gender disparities in treatment outcomes and address the use of alcohol during ART. Successful ART medication adherence interventions in China can inform other international settings that face similar adherence challenges and disparities."

Three groups of patients were enrolled: group 1, asymptomatic patients (n = 30); group 2, AIDS symptomatic patients without body weight loss or diarrhea (n = 37); and group 3, AIDS symptomatic patients with severe body weight loss and/or diarrhea (n = 33). Clinical and biological data (covariates) were collected. A population approach was performed with three blood samples per patient to estimate the mean population pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance [CL]/oral bioavailability [F], V/F, k(a), and lag time) and the derived ones (k(el), C(max), T(max), and area under the curve [AUC]). The relationships between groups, exposure (i.e., estimated individual post hoc AUCs), and covariates were explored by using multiple linear regressions. A significant increase in median AUCs (165, 349, and 705 ng. h. ml(-1) for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively [P < 0.0001]) was observed. The enhancement in saquinavir exposure could be due to the destruction of the transporters in enterocytes and/or to the enlargement of their tight junctions, allowing a paracellular crossing of saquinavir as the illness spreads. Because of grapefruit juice intake by every patient, no implication of CYP3A4 could be assessed. These results strongly suggest that, despite its low intrinsic oral bioavailability, saquinavir can be considered as a relevant treatment for HIV-1-infected patients with diarrhea and/or wasting syndrome. This must be evaluated in a long-term period."

A significant proportion of the hygienists had taken care of HIV-positive patients or patients known to be at risk for contracting HIV infection. None of the hygienists had antibodies to HIV. Five hygienists who came from or worked in high-endemic areas for hepatitis B infection had antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen, consistent with previous infection with hepatitis B virus. The study is in agreement with previous reports on blood-borne infections among health care workers, concluding that the risk for dental hygienists of contracting HIV and hepatitis B infection is minimal."
5946,0.001,1.0000,"Previous research has questioned the effectiveness of existing methods to identify individuals at high risk for contracting and transmitting human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted diseases. Thus, new approaches are needed to provide these individuals with risk-reduction strategies. We review our research on young adults' sexual decision making by using theories and methods from social and cognitive sciences. Four patterns of condom use and associated levels of risks and beliefs were identified. These patterns suggest value in targeting intervention strategies to individuals at different levels of risk. The findings also imply that the monogamous population may be at higher risk for infection than they realize. Primary-care physicians are the first line of contact for many individuals in the health care system and may be in the best position to screen for at-risk individuals. Given the time demands and other barriers, easy-to-use, evidence-based guidelines for such screening are needed. We propose such guidelines for primary-care physicians to use in identifying an individual's risk, from which custom-tailored intervention strategies can be developed."

Despite these challenges, the intense efforts focused on addressing the HIV epidemic present an opportunity for overall health systems improvement in developing nations. In October 2006, Harvard University's Centers for AIDS Research, the Nelson Mandela School of Medicine, the Department of Health of KwaZulu-Natal, and the Medical Research Council of South Africa held a conference entitled ""The Realities of Antiretroviral Therapy Rollout: Challenges to Successful Programmatic Implementation"" in Durban, South Africa.

Bronchoscopy and intensive care services often require close contact with patients and the use of sharp devices required for intravascular catheterization. Rendering such care places physicians at risk for acquiring agents such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis viruses, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As of December 1998, 188 cases of occupational transmission of HIV to health care workers (HCWs) in the United States have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control. Most documented cases of seroconversion involve percutaneous injury involving blood, with the greatest risks being associated with injury from a hollow-bore needle that has been in an infected patient's vein or artery. Because thousands of HIV-infected persons are unaware of their infection, HCWs must consider all patients to be infected with HIV and improve work practices accordingly. Nevertheless, elimination of all exposures is impossible, and postexposure prophylaxis with combination antiretroviral therapy is recommended for persons deemed a high risk of contracting HIV. Pulmonary specialists are at high risk of exposure to tuberculosis; proper precautions include isolation of patients with suspected tuberculosis and the use of DMF-HEPA respirator masks, especially while performing procedures like bronchoscopy. Contaminated bronchoscopes have been implicated in transmission and ""pseudoinfection"" of tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria, underscoring the need for rigorous cleaning and disinfection practices."

Electronic medical records (EMRs) can aid in documenting care, monitoring drug adherence and response to therapy, and providing data for quality improvement and research. Faculty at Moi University in Kenya and Indiana and University in the USA opened adult and pediatric HIV clinics in a national referral hospital, a district hospital, and six rural health centers in western Kenya using a newly developed EMR to support comprehensive outpatient HIV/AIDS care. Demographic, clinical, and HIV risk data, diagnostic test results, and treatment information are recorded on paper encounter forms and hand-entered into a central database that prints summary flowsheets and reminders for appropriate testing and treatment. There are separate modules for monitoring the Antenatal Clinic and Pharmacy. The EMR was designed with input from clinicians who understand the local community and constraints of providing care in resource poor settings. To date, the EMR contains more than 30,000 visit records for more than 4000 patients, almost half taking antiretroviral drugs.

This is a prospective study of all treatment-naive patients (N=735) recruited from all three public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal and followed up at 6 and 12 months being on ART. Results indicated that despite a decrease in stigma seen in this study (may be due to ART) the level of stigma and discrimination remains high, and stigma reduction interventions are urgently needed in this population. CD4 cell counts significantly increased and HIV symptoms reduced significantly but depression symptoms remained high and even increased after 12 months on treatment. In multivariate analysis lower CD4 cell counts (odds ratio 0.5, 0.3-0.9), severe depression (5.6, 2.5-12.5) and low QoL (0.6, 0.5-0.8) were associated with internalized AIDS stigma. These findings may suggest that HIV care should include counseling and support that includes stigma concerns, depression, and QoL prior to and during the first year following diagnosis."
8481,0.001,1.0000,"Behaviors associated with transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were measured in a sample of 60 adults with a severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI). Results revealed that 68% had sex in the last year; 13% of men and 30% of women reported two or more male partners, and 24% of men also reported two or more female partners. Condom use was inconsistent. Sex partners were often met in a psychiatric clinic or bar, and a substantial number were injection drug users or known to be non-monogamous. Overall, 48% of men and 37% of women reported at least one risk factor. Hypothesized psychological antecedents of HIV-related risk behavior were also measured, including knowledge, motivation for risk reduction, and self-efficacy regarding risk-reduction. Many participants were misinformed regarding HIV-transmission and risk reduction. Motivational indices indicated that attitudes toward condoms were slightly positive, and that social norms were generally supportive of condom use. However, participants tended to rate themselves at only slight risk for infection, undermining their motivation for condom use. Participants indicated only modest levels of self-efficacy in situations requiring sexual assertiveness. These findings, coupled with the elevated seroprevalence of HIV among persons having a SPMI, point to the need for risk assessment and counseling by mental health care providers."

Our study showed a 9.3% incidence of clinical HBV infection, poor perception of risk of infection, poor local availability of vaccines, and low uptake where same was available. Reasons cited for non-immunization are lack of awareness, cost, inertia and non-availability of vaccines. Only 10.2% of our respondents always used barrier methods, and 77.7% of our respondents do not check the immune status of their patients after sustaining an intraoperative sharp injury. The overall level of knowledge about HBV infection was deemed poor. We conclude with recommendations on how to improve knowledge about HBV infection and uptake of vaccines."

This infection is self-limiting in healthy persons; however, it can be severe, progressive and persistent in those who are immunocompromised. There are few published studies concerning cryptosporidiosis and Cryptosporidium genotypes in Iranian immunocompromised patients and none of them describe risk factors. This study was undertaken to identify prevalence, genotypes and risk factors for cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised patients. Three fecal samples were obtained at two day intervals from each of the 183 patients and processed with modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining methods and 18S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. The overall infection prevalence was 6%. Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in isolates from five HIV-infected patients, one patient who had undergone bone marrow transplantation and one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cryptosporidium hominis was identified in isolates from two HIV-infected patients and two patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. According to univariate analysis, the statistically significant factors were diarrhea (OR = 21.7, CI = 2.83-78.4, P= 0.003), CD4 + lymphocytes less than 100 cells/mm(3) (OR = 41.3, CI = 13.45-114.8, P < 0.0001), other microbial infections (OR = 7.1321.7, CI = 1.97-25.73, P = 0.006), weight loss (OR = 73.78, CI = 15.5-350, P < 0.0001), abdominal pain (OR = 10.29, CI = 2.81-37.74.4, P= 0.001), dehydration (OR = 72.1, CI = 17.6-341.5, P < 0.0001), vomiting (OR = 4.87, CI = 1.4-16.9, P= 0.015), nausea (OR = 9.4, CI = 2.38-37.2, P < 0.001), highly active antiretroviral therapy (OR = 0.089, CI = 0.01-0.8, P= 0.015) and diarrhea in household members (OR = 7.37, CI = 2.04-26.66, P= 0.001). After multivariate analysis and a backward deletion process, only < 100 CD4 + T-lymphocytes/mm(3) maintained a significant association with infection.

2170,0.001,1.0000,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an acute prothrombotic disorder. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an identified precipitant. This study reviewed 30 episodes of HIV-associated TTP in 24 patients from the South-East England Apheresis units, over the last 10 years. All patients were heterosexual Black Africans. First presentation of TTP revealed a new diagnosis of HIV in eight patients. TTP relapse occurred on six occasions (in four patients) as a result of non-adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Prompt initiation/re-initiation of HAART in parallel with plasma exchange (PEX)±steroid led to prompt remission. Adjunct immunomodulatory agents (e.g. Rituximab) were required in 10% of cases. Once-daily HAART regimens are recommended, being compatible with PEX requirement, maximizing drug exposure between PEX. High viral loads (>500,000 copies/ml) require more PEX to remission. ADAMTS13 activity was reduced (<5%) as detected by collagen-binding assay and anti-ADAMTS13 immunoglobulin G antibodies were raised in 80%. Continued HAART-adherence ensured a durable TTP remission with associated viral control resulting in no evidence of relapse. PEX and HAART are associated with replenishment of ADAMTS13 and viral suppression. More PEX is required in cases with higher viral loads. Continued HAART maintains remission. In a small proportion of cases, further immunomodulatory therapy may be required."
3919,0.001,1.0000,"The influence of HIV burden variations on the frequencies of Ag-specific CD8+ T cell responses was evaluated before and during highly active antiretroviral therapy by analyzing the number, diversity, and function of these cells. The frequencies of HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ PBL binding HLA-A2/HIV-epitope tetramers or producing IFN-gamma were below 1%. A panel of 16 CTL epitopes covering 15 HLA class I molecules in 14 patients allowed us to test 3.8 epitopes/patient and to detect 2.2 +/- 1.8 HIV epitope-specific CD8+ subsets per patient with a median frequency of 0.24% (0.11-4. 79%). During the first month of treatment, viral load rapidly decreased and frequencies of HIV-specific CD8 PBL tripled, eight new HIV specificities appeared of 11 undetectable at entry, while CMV-specific CD8+ PBL also appeared. With efficient HIV load control, all HIV specificities decayed involving a reduction of the CD8+CD27+CD11ahigh HIV-specific effector subset. Virus rebounds triggered by scheduled drug interruptions or transient therapeutic failures induced four patterns of epitope-specific CD8+ lymphocyte dynamics, i.e., peaks or disappearance of preexisting specificities, emergence of new specificities, or lack of changes. The HIV load rebounds mobilized both effector/memory HIV- and CMV-specific CD8+ lymphocytes. Therefore, frequencies of virus-specific CD8 T cells appear to be positively correlated to HIV production in most cases during highly active antiretroviral therapy, but an inverse correlation can also be observed with rapid virus changes that might involve redistribution, sequestration, or expansion of these Ag-specific CD8 T cells. Future strategies of therapeutic interruptions should take into account these various HIV-specific cell dynamics during HIV rebounds."
5736,0.001,1.0000,"The cytopathic effect of HIV on CD4 T cells, as well as the active autoimmune mechanism occurring during infection, have been documented. Of the cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of AIDS, the main one produced by the monocyte-macrophage series is tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF alpha). This cytokine induces antigens such as proteinase 3 (Pr 3) or mieloperoxidase (MPO). Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are directed against this type of PMN antigens. In the present paper, the role of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in HIV infected patients as responsible for autoimmune phenomena in relation to opportunistic infections, was studied. A total of 88 serum samples belonging to 49 asymptomatic and 39 symptomatic HIV infected patients were tested for ANCA by an indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) test over a neutrophil substrate. ANCA were detected in 53.8% of symptomatic patients as compared to 4.1% in asymptomatic cases (p < 0.0001). A 95.9% correlation was observed between ANCA-positive samples and pulmonary infection (n = 20). In those ANCA (+) samples 95.9% correlation was found with pulmonary infection (n = 20). Pulmonary infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a frequent finding in HIV infected patients from Northeastern Argentina. When the presence of ANCA in TB(+) HIV(+) and TB(+) HIV(-) patients was studied, it was seen that positive-ANCA significantly correlated with the first group (p < 0.001). The presence of ANCA was not related to viral infections, toxoplasmosis, neurological features of AIDS, vasculitis or malignant diseases. ANCA during pulmonary infection, mostly caused by TB, as well as PMN infiltration in pulmonary parenchyma, and the deregulated immune reaction elicited by HIV, may contribute to the onset of autoimmune phenomena. The presence of human T lymphocytes reactive to heat stress proteins (Hsp), an important target of immune response against certain intracellular auto-antigens such as MPO from PMN, added to the mechanism of molecular mimicry, could explain the association of ANCA and TB in patients with severe alterations of their immune response. According to these results, the limited presence of ANCA in asymptomatic patients HIV(+) and in HIV(-) with pulmonar TB, could indicate that the virus may not be responsible for the induction of these antibodies."
7533,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-positive individuals who use injection drugs (IDU) may have lower rates of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, previous studies of factors associated with adherence to ART among IDU have been limited primarily to samples drawn from clinical settings and in areas with financial barriers to healthcare.We evaluated patterns of ART adherence and rates of plasma HIV RNA response among a Canadian cohort of community-recruited IDU. Using data from a community-recruited cohort of antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected IDU, we investigated ART adherence patterns based on prescription refill compliance and factors associated with time to plasma HIV-1 RNA suppression (<500 copies/mL) using Cox proportional hazards regression in a setting with universal health care, including free ART. Between 1996 and 2008, 267 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected IDU initiated ART and had a median of 51 months (inter-quartile range: 17-95 months) of follow-up. Overall, 81 (30.3%) were ≥95% adherent during the first year of HAART and 187 (70.0%) achieved HIV RNA suppression at least once over the study period, for an incidence-density of 34.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.8-39.9) per 100 person-years. The Kaplan-Meier cumulative plasma HIV RNA suppression rates at 12 months after the initiation of ART were 80.8% (95% CI: 71.2-88.7) for adherent and 28.9% (95% CI: 22.8-36.1) for non-adherent participants. While several socio-demographic characteristics and drug-using behaviours were identified as barriers to successful treatment in unadjusted analyses, the factor most strongly associated with time to HIV RNA suppression in multivariate analysis was adherence to ART of at least 95% (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 6.0, 95% CI: 4.2-8.6, p<0.001). These results demonstrate low rates of adherence to ART among a community-recruited cohort of IDU and reinforce the importance of adherence as the key determinant of successful virological response to antiretroviral therapy."
5290,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, a chronic and incurable disease of the human immune system. As the standard of care for the patients with HIV-1, current highly active antiretroviral treatment has been therapeutically effective in most patients; however, it is not curative, and highly active antiretroviral treatment is intolerable because of severe adverse effects. Therefore, nucleic acid-based therapeutics, such as antisense oligonucleotide, ribozyme, messenger RNA, RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapeutics, aptamer, and so on, have been actively developed as alternative or adjuvant agents for those chemical antiviral drugs to surmount those drawbacks. The combinatorial use of various antiviral nucleic acids could be more efficacious in blocking viral replication and preventing the emergence of resistant variants. In this regard, RNAi can function as a gene-specific therapeutic option for controlling HIV-1 replication. Another type of therapeutic nucleic acid--aptamers--shows promise as a new and potent class of anti-HIV agent and can additionally function as a cell-type-specific delivery vehicle for targeted RNAi. The combined use of small interfering RNA (siRNAs) and aptamers could effectively block viral replication and prevent the emergence of resistant variants. The present review offers a brief overview of the use of cell-type-specific aptamer and aptamer-siRNA conjugates' development in our group for the treatment of HIV-1. Their potentials for targeted delivering RNAi therapeutics (eg, siRNA) and suppressing HIV-1 replication in vitro and in humanized animal model will be highlighted here."
709,0.001,1.0000,"In vitro proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was used to measure virus-specific cell-mediated immunity (vCMI) following neonatal woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection. Fifteen neonates were inoculated with the W8 strain of WHV. In 11, infection was resolved, and 4 became chronic carriers. Nineteen neonates were inoculated with the W7 strain and all became chronic carriers. Seven age-matched uninfected woodchucks served as controls. Virologic and vCMI profiles among the W8 and W7 infections were compared and related to the outcome of infection. Resolving woodchucks had robust, acute-phase vCMI to WHV antigens (core, surface, and x) and to several nonoverlapping core peptides. The acute-phase vCMI was associated temporally with the clearance of viral DNA and of surface antigen from serum at 14 to 22 weeks postinfection. In contrast, in approximately half of the W8 and W7 infections that progressed to chronicity, no significant acute-phase vCMI was detected. In the remaining carriers, acute-phase vCMI was observed, but it was less frequent and incomplete compared to that of resolved woodchucks. Serum viral load developed less rapidly in those carriers that had evidence of acute-phase vCMI, but it was still increased compared to that of resolving woodchucks. Thus, vigorous and multispecific acute-phase vCMI was associated with resolution of neonatal WHV infection. Absent or incomplete acute-phase vCMI was associated with the progression to chronic infection. By analogy, these results suggest that the onset of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in humans may be associated with deficiencies in the primary T-cell response to acute HBV infection."
7432,0.001,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis B virus share common routes of transmission, and hence, coinfection with these two viruses is common. Chronic hepatitis B does not influence the progression of HIV disease or the response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. It is clear, however, that HIV infection does impact the course of hepatitis B, as higher rates of chronic carriage, lower seroconversion rates, and accelerated progression towards cirrhosis have been observed. Vaccination against hepatitis B is less effective in HIV-infected individuals. Coinfected subjects have a poor response to interferon therapy. Lamivudine is more effective in coinfected subjects but must not be used as monotherapy because of the risk of resistance developing. Combination therapy with lamivudine and tenofovir has shown promise and is currently being investigated in clinical trials, while new drugs and other combinations are in development."
5318,0.001,1.0000,"To reduce the opportunities for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to evade vaccine induced immunity, the development of subunit vaccines must focus on the characterization of immunogenic epitopes, which are major targets for the immune system. The most dominant site for elicitation of neutralising immune response is located on the external envelope glycoprotein gp120 within the third variable domain (V3). To overcome virus type specificity of antibodies directed to the V3-domain we designed a 36 amino acids long gp120/V3-consensus peptide (V3-C36) based on published biological data and sequence comparisons of various HIV-1 virus isolates. This peptide contains a conserved core sequence which is suggested to form a surface-exposed beta-turn. This peptide also includes T-cell epitopes defined in mice and humans, an ADCC-epitope and two highly conserved cysteine residues which were oxidized to form a cystine derivate, thus allowing correct peptide folding. In ELISA-tests, this peptide reacts with at least 90% of randomly selected sera of European and African patients infected with HIV-1 and is recognized by three different HIV-1/V3 ""type-specific"" antisera (MN, RF, IIIB-strain). Using this peptide as immunogen in rabbits, antisera could be raised with highly cross-reactive and HIV-1/IIIB strain neutralizing properties. Moreover, HTLV/HIV-1/IIIB specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) of BALB/c mice infected with a gp120 recombinant vaccinia virus recognized the central 16- and 12-mer peptides of the V3-C36 consensus peptide in cytolytic assays, indicating perfect compatibility of the consensus peptide with the IIIB-primed CTLs. The DNA-sequence encoding the V3-consensus loop region might be an important component in newly designed recombinant subunit vaccines. In addition, due to its broad serological reactivity, the V3-consensus peptide might play an important role in special diagnostic purposes."
4121,0.001,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has a significant impact on HIV-1 RNA levels, the CD4 cell count, and immune activation. We examined whether these changes are associated with a change in the rate of tryptophan degradation (expressed as the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio, kyn/trp) as an estimate for the activity of interferon-gamma inducible enzyme indoleamine (, )-dioxygenase (IDO). Plasma levels of tryptophan, kynurenine, and neopterin were measured pretherapy and 6 months postinitiation of therapy in 45 patients with HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 1000 copies/ml 6 months after initiation of ART. Before ART, the patients had decreased tryptophan and increased kynurenine concentrations compared to healthy controls. During ART, average tryptophan levels increased; in the same time kynurenine and kyn/trp decreased (P < 0.001), although not to normal levels. Since pretherapy tryptophan concentrations correlated inversely with neopterin, and kynurenine correlated with viral load and neopterin but not with CD4 cell count, the data support the view that HIV production may induce immune activation and consequently tryptophan is degraded at a higher rate. In agreement, kyn/trp positively correlated with neopterin (r(s) = 0.60, P < 0.001), with virus load (r(s) = 0.37, P = 0.013), and very weakly with CD4(+) cells counts (r(s) = 0.30, P = 0.049). The change in the kyn/trp ratio during ART correlated more strongly with the change in neopterin levels (r(s) = 0.49, P = 0.001) than with the change in HIV RNA levels and weakly with the CD4 cell count. The data underscore the fact that both neopterin production and tryptophan degradation are triggered by immune activation. Tryptophan degradation is increased in HIV infection and partially reversed under ART. The data agree with the concept that immune activation is the common background of IDO activation which may be an important factor underlying T-cell hyporesponsiveness."
694,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1 infection is characterized by loss of CD4T cells, leading to immunodeficiency. Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) results in suppression of the viral load and increased CD4 counts. Both viral and host factors determine CD4 cell responses to ART with approximately 15-30% of individuals having suboptimal increase of CD4T cell count, most commonly due to lack of compliance to ART. A smaller fraction of patients will have immune reconstitution failure and suboptimal CD4 increase despite suppression of HIV replication, and these individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. We sought to characterize the factors associated with decreased immunological response among Manitoba's HIV patient population. This retrospective case-control study included HIV patients with immune reconstitution failure despite suppression of HIV replication by ART. The immune reconstitution failure was defined by CD4 cell count increase from baseline of less than 100 CD4 cells/mm"
2290,0.001,1.0000,"Immune activation seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The immune activation markers neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin can predict the future rate of the decrease in CD4+ T cells. In a longitudinal study, we assessed whether the decline in the CD4+ T-cell count is associated with increased concentrations of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 75 (sTNFR 75), compared to increased concentrations of beta 2-microglobulin and urinary neopterin. Forty-seven individuals representing all stages of HIV infection were followed-up for a mean of 12.7 months (range, 8 to 16 months). The percentage of the change of the CD4+ T-cell count from study entry to study end ranged from -97 to +98%; the median was -33%. Concentrations of urinary neopterin, sTNFR 75, and beta 2-microglobulin correlated with the percentage of the change of the CD4+ T-cell count from study entry to study end (r = -0.45, confidence interval (CI) -0.65 to -0.19; r = -0.42, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.15; and r = -0.416, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.15), but those of sICAM-1 did not. This difference was found despite significant correlations between sICAM-1 and sTNFR 75 and beta 2-microglobulin. Levels of sICAM-1 obtained at study entry correlated with levels of sICAM-1 obtained at study end (r = 0.46, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.68). In a multivariate linear regression analysis, urinary neopterin and sTNFR 75 were jointly significant for the percentage of the change of the CD4+ T-cell count. These results suggest that sTNFR 75 is a useful marker to estimate disease progression in HIV infection, whereas sICAM-1 does not seem to provide any information related to the decline of the CD4+ T-cell count."
7551,0.001,1.0000,"Plasma levels of soluble CD27 (sCD27) are elevated in diseases characterized by T cell activation and are used as a marker of immune activation. We assessed the usefulness of determining plasma sCD27 as a marker for monitoring immune activation in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A first cross-sectional examination of 68 HIV-1-infected and 18 normal subjects showed high levels of sCD27 in HIV-1 infection; plasma sCD27 was correlated to HIV-1 viraemia and inversely correlated to CD4+ T cell count. Twenty-six HIV-1-infected patients undergoing HAART were studied at baseline and after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of therapy. Seven additional patients under HAART were analysed at baseline, during and after interruption of therapy. In the total population, HAART induced a significant and progressive reduction, but not a normalization, of plasma levels of sCD27 after 24 months. A full normalization of plasma sCD27 was observed in the virological responders (undetectable HIV-1 RNA at months 18 and 24) and also in patients with moderate immunodeficiency at baseline (CD4+ T cell count >200 cells/mm3). Changes in plasma neopterin paralleled the changes in sCD27 but only baseline sCD27 levels were predictive of a greater increase in CD4+ T cell count during the follow-up. Discontinuation of therapy resulted in a rapid increase of sCD27 plasma levels associated with viraemia rebound and drop in CD4+ T cell count. Our findings suggest that plasma sCD27 may represent an alternative and simple marker to monitor immune activation during potent antiretroviral therapy. HIV-1-induced immune activation can be normalized by HAART in successfully treated patients where the disease is not advanced."
7544,0.001,1.0000,"Aberrant expression of regulatory receptors programmed death-1 (PD-1) and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) is linked with dysregulation and exhaustion of T lymphocytes during chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection; however, less is known about whether a similar process impacts B-lymphocyte function during HIV-1 infection. We reasoned that disruption of the peripheral B cell compartment might be associated with decreased neutralizing antibody activity. Expression of markers that indicate dysregulation (BTLA and PD-1), immune activation (CD95), and proliferation (Ki-67) was evaluated in B cells from HIV-1-infected viremic and aviremic subjects and healthy subjects, in conjunction with immunoglobulin production and CD4 T cell count. Viral load and cross-clade neutralizing activity in plasma from viremic subjects were also assessed. Dysregulation of B lymphocytes was indicated by a marked disruption of peripheral B cell subsets, increased levels of PD-1 expression, and decreased levels of BTLA expression in viremic subjects compared to aviremic subjects and healthy controls. PD-1 and BTLA were correlated in a divergent fashion with immune activation, CD4 T cell count, and the total plasma IgG level, a functional correlate of B cell dysfunction. Within viremic subjects, the total IgG level correlated directly with cross-clade neutralizing activity in plasma. The findings demonstrate that even in chronically infected subjects in which B lymphocytes display multiple indications of dysfunction, antibodies that mediate cross-clade neutralization breadth continue to circulate in plasma."
9068,0.001,1.0000,"There is some ongoing debate as to whether tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha levels are elevated in human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), however TNF alpha is rapidly cleared from the circulation and long-term markers have to be analyzed. Two distinct TNF alpha receptors have been identified, which also exist in soluble forms. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an association in HIV infection exists between the serum levels of TNF alpha, the two soluble TNF receptors (sTNFRs) and other soluble immune activation markers, namely neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin, and the number of CD4+ T-cells. We investigated 63 individuals with HIV infection for serum levels of TNF alpha, sTNFR 55, sTNFR 75, beta 2-microglobulin and urinary neopterin. The study population comprised all stages of HIV infection: 35 were asymptomatic, 8 had oral candidiasis, 4 had constitutional signs and 16 had AIDS. Circulating levels of TNF alpha were detectable in 22 of 63 (34.9%) individuals. For those with detectable TNF alpha levels the median concentration was 40 pg/ml. The frequency and extent of TNF alpha levels found in those with advanced HIV infection as defined by a CD4+ T-cell count below 320 x 10(6)/l did not differ significantly compared to those with a higher CD4+ T-cell count. Increased concentrations were found in 69.8% of the patients for sTNFR 55 and in 87.3% for sTNFR 75. Serum concentrations of sTNFR 55 and sTNFR 75 were higher in the group with the lower CD4 T-cell count (P = 0.006 and P = 0.0003). TNF alpha correlated with sTNFR 75 and weakly with sTNFR 55 and beta 2-microglobulin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8316,0.001,1.0000,"In contrast to HIV-infected humans, naturally SIV-infected sooty mangabeys (SMs) very rarely progress to AIDS. Although the mechanisms underlying this disease resistance are unknown, a consistent feature of natural SIV infection is the absence of the generalized immune activation associated with HIV infection. To define the correlates of preserved CD4(+) T cell counts in SMs, we conducted a cross-sectional immunological study of 110 naturally SIV-infected SMs. The nonpathogenic nature of the infection was confirmed by an average CD4(+) T cell count of 1,076 +/- 589/mm(3) despite chronic infection with a highly replicating virus. No correlation was found between CD4(+) T cell counts and either age (used as a surrogate marker for length of infection) or viremia. The strongest correlates of preserved CD4(+) T cell counts were a low percentage of circulating effector T cells (CD28(-)CD95(+) and/or IL-7R/CD127(-)) and a high percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells. These findings support the hypothesis that the level of immune activation is a key determinant of CD4(+) T cell counts in SIV-infected SMs. Interestingly, we identified 14 animals with CD4(+) T cell counts of <500/mm(3), of which two show severe and persistent CD4(+) T cell depletion (<50/mm(3)). Thus, significant CD4(+) T cell depletion does occasionally follow SIV infection of SMs even in the context of generally low levels of immune activation, lending support to the hypothesis of multifactorial control of CD4(+) T cell homeostasis in this model of infection. The absence of AIDS in these ""CD4(low)"" naturally SIV-infected SMs defines a protective role of the reduced immune activation even in the context of a significant CD4(+) T cell depletion."

GB virus C (GBV-C) infection is associated with reduced T-cell activation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. T-cell activation and DNTCs were measured in HIV-infected subjects with a nondetectable HIV load. GBV-C-viremic subjects had significantly reduced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell activation (P = .003 and .034, respectively) and significantly increased DNTCs (P = .038), compared with nonviremic subjects. GBV-C load correlated with DNTC percentage (P = .004). Thus, GBV-C infection is associated with an increase in DNTCs, which may contribute to reduced immune activation during HIV infection."

Statistical analysis of the case studies shows 120/cumm median CD4+ blood cell count, and the OIs showed an inversely proportional occurrence to the CD4+ count of the immunocompromised patients. The spectrum and frequency of certain OIs highlight the urgency of studying HIV/AIDS in resource-limited countries where locally specific disease patterns may be observed. The purpose of the present investigation was the identification of such opportunistic pathogens, as we feel the HIV epidemic can be more effectively managed if physicians and health planners are aware of this information."

But choice of an ideal, cost-effective, and rapid test for HIV infection is of immense value for use in developing countries like India, where resources are limited. In this study we have evaluated the performance characteristics of the rapid immunochromatographic HIV test kit First Response HIV 1-2.O. First, the laboratory archived 450 characterized plasma/serum specimens, which were tested on First Response HIV 1-2.O. Second, a total of 134 consecutive voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) specimens were also tested and positive specimens were further confirmed with HIV TRI-DOT. All these VCT specimens were cross-checked with HIV double-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Murex and Vironostika), and the results were matched. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and efficiency of First Response HIV 1-2.O with the 450 characterized specimens was 100% for HIV-1 with reference assay. The results in the VCT algorithm were correlating with double-ELISA. In the HIV-2 analysis, five HIV-2-positive specimens in First Response HIV 1-2.O were found to be HIV-2-indeterminate on Western blot. HIV TRI-DOT was unable to pick up two HIV-2 Western blot-positive specimens. First Response HIV 1-2.O has several advantages: low-cost (U.S. $0.70); only 10 microL of specimen; involves only two steps; room temperature storage; ability to differentiate HIV-1 and 2; and use of whole blood specimen. Hence this test kit could be suitable for initial screening in the HIV testing algorithm in resource-limited settings. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 22:178-185, 2008. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

The study participants were obtained by randomly selecting 10-household clusters from Unga limited, the town of Babati, and the roadside village of Matufa, which are urban, semi-urban, and rural communities, respectively. Informed verbal consent for participation in an interview and in HIV-1 testing was sought from each respondent. Blood samples were collected from each consenting individual for HIV-1 antibody testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and all positive sera were confirmed using repeated ELISA tests. Information of risk factors was obtained through the interview process using a structured questionnaire. Of the 567 women who gave blood samples, 48 (8.5%) were HIV-1 positive. The HIV-1 seroprevalence rates among women in the urban area, the semi-urban area, and the rural village were 14.4%, 6.9% and 2.3%, respectively. Factors associated with significantly higher HIV-1 seroprevalence were urban residence; history of having traveled out of the Arusha region within Tanzania, as well as having traveled abroad; having multiple sex partners; and having sexual intercourse under the influence of alcohol. Women who reported ever having used condoms had significantly higher probability of being infected with HIV-1 than those who had never used condoms, suggesting that condom use may be a marker of high-risk sexual behavior and that condom use is probably not adhered to in a way that consistently protects against HIV-1 infection. These results suggest the need for health education interventions aimed at increasing appropriate and consistent condom use and reduction of the number of sexual partners."

Of these, 215 men returned for post test interview and physical exam and were compared with 1,348 men randomly selected HIV-1 seronegative men. None of the HIV-1 seropositive had a history of injecting drug use or had received blood transfusion in the past seven years. HIV-1 seropositivity was associated with the TPHA serological marker for syphylis > 1.160 (p = 0.015, odd ratio 1.8), history of urethritis (p = 0.009, odd ratio 1.92) (Table 4). This study found that HIV-1 seropositive men were mostly single, were likely to be from the rural northern provinces of Thailand or Bangkok. History of purchase of low-fee commercial sex and less condom use were significantly associated with HIV-1 seropositivity as was a history of STD in the year prior to interview. Information on HIV disease and pre-test/post test counselling is needed for Thai laborers who are applying for work abroad to countries which require HIV and syphylis screening. In this effort, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, the Ministry of Public Health and the clinic for laborers going abroad should join forces to provide this service.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed diverse HBV subgenotypes including A2 and A6 (46.8%), D1-D4 (38.8%), E (9.7%), C1 (1.6%), and B2 (1.6%). The study population consisted of patients with different ethnic origin (Caucasian, Turkish, Asian, Arab, and African). One HBV D/C recombinant isolate was identified, which encoded subtype adw2. An HBV subgenotype D4 with an aberrant subtype ayw4 was detected. Although none of the genotypes was associated with a specific disease outcome, several nucleotide substitutions, deletions and insertions were observed within the HBV preS1/S and X genes, particularly among patients with active chronic hepatitis B infection and patients with cirrhosis. Within the immunological domain of the HBsAg gene, the most frequent substitutions were sT125M and sT118A. High rates of precore and basal core promoter mutations were detected in patients infected with genotype D of HBV. Almost half of the patients who received lamivudine therapy for at least 1 year had HBV variants associated with lamivudine drug resistance. In conclusion, the most common HBV genotypes in West Europe (A and D) also prevail in Belgium. The highest degree of genetic diversity was detected in HBV genotype D.

2679,0.001,1.0000,"Since expression of both interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2-receptor-alpha (IL-2R-alpha) by lymphocytes is inhibited by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro, we hypothesized that HIV-co-infection among persons with tuberculosis (TB) might impair T-lymphocyte responses to TB via this mechanism. We measured soluble IL-2R-alpha (sIL-2R-alpha), a surrogate marker of T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation, and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor I (sTNF-RI) in sera from West African patients categorized into 4 groups: those with TB alone (TB+ HIV-, n = 55), CD4-matched groups with TB and HIV co-infection (TB+ HIV+, n = 50) or HIV infection alone (TB- HIV+, n = 35), and patients with neither disease (TB- HIV-, n = 35). The median level of sIL-2R-alpha was markedly greater in the TB+ HIV- group (1580 U/mL) compared to the TB- HIV- (670 U/mL; P < 0.001) and TB- HIV+ (880 U/mL; P < 0.01) groups. More importantly, the median concentration of sIL-2R-alpha was much lower in the TB+ HIV+ group (855 U/mL) compared to the TB+ HIV- group (1580 U/mL; P < 0.01) despite similar levels of sTNF-RI. These results suggest that T-lymphocyte activation in TB patients is impaired by HIV co-infection and, furthermore, this suppressive effect was independent of numerical depletion of CD4 lymphocytes. Impairment to IL-2-signalling might contribute to the profound impact that HIV has had on both the incidence and the clinicopathological manifestations of TB."

In this work we focused on the relationship between sTNFRII and HIV burden in 95 HIV-1+ patients without AIDS grouped according to the 1993 classification of the CDC as group A, n = 55, and group B, n = 40. Compared with healthy controls, higher values of sTNFRII were obtained in all groups of HIV-1 infected patients (P < 0.001), but we found no inverse correlation between sTNFRII and CD4+ lymphocyte counts in CDC group A and B of the disease, and no correlation with log RNA copy number in patients with CD4 T-cell counts > 499/microl. A correlation was obtained between sTNFRII and the viral load in patients with CD4 T-cell counts ranging from 200 to 499/microl, but only in CDC group B patients (P < 0.01, n = 26). There was no correlation between the variations of sTNFRII and HIV-1 RNA levels in 19 CDC group A and 15 CDC group B clinically stable patients in the course of a short follow up. The plasma level of sTNFRII do not appear as a valuable surrogate marker of the plasma level of HIV-1 RNA in patients. Further investigations are needed to define the mechanism of the raised level of sTNFRII in HIV-1 infected patients."

As such, mapping the details of cell type-specific degradation of immune function as a consequence of changes to signaling network responses has not been readily accessible. We used a flow cytometric-based assay of signaling to determine Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/STAT) signaling changes at the single-cell level within distinct cell subsets from the primary immune cells of HIV-1-infected donors. We identified a specific defect in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-driven Stat5 phosphorylation in the monocytes of HIV-1+ donors. This inhibition was statistically significant in a cohort of treated and untreated individuals. Ex vivo Stat5 phosphorylation levels varied among HIV-1+ donors but did not correlate with CD4(+) T-cell counts or HIV-1 plasma viral load. Low Stat5 activation occurred in HIV-1-infected donors despite normal GM-CSF receptor levels. Investigation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, also stimulated by GM-CSF, led to the observation that lipopolysaccharide-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation is enhanced in monocytes. Thus, we have identified a specific, imbalanced monocyte signaling profile, with inhibition of STAT and enhancement of MAPK signaling, associated with HIV-1 infection. This understanding of altered monocyte signaling responses that contribute to defective antigen presentation during HIV-1 infection could lead to immunotherapeutic approaches that compensate for the deficiency."

Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against viruses isolated from the infected partner, and against laboratory virus isolates, were detected in 5 (45%) of 11 HIV-negative partners, including a CCR5Delta32-homozygous and a heterozygous subject. No CTL responses were observed in 6 control unexposed subjects. Marked variation in lymphocyte susceptibility to viral infection was noted.

Testin the lymphoproliferative response (LPR) is the standard technique used to evaluate T-helper response, but its use in the routine diagnostic laboratory setting can be problematic. The most promising new alternative technique is the determination of HCMV-specific CD4(+) T-cell frequency by flow cytometry detection of intracellular cytokine production after short-term antigen-specific activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. HCMV-specific LPR and CD4(+) T-cell frequency were compared in a group of 78 blood samples from 65 HIV-infected patients. The results showed concordance in 80.7% of samples. In addition, comparative analysis of sequential blood samples from 13 HIV-infected patients showed that while in about half of patients the T-helper HCMV-specific immune response remained stable during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), in the other half declining levels of the HCMV-specific CD4(+)-mediated immune response were determined by either one or both assays. In conclusion, our data suggest that the determination of HCMV-specific CD4(+) T-cell frequency can be considered a valuable alternative to the LPR test for the detection of HCMV-specific T-helper response in HIV-infected patients. It could facilitate wider screening of anti-HCMV T-helper activity in HIV-infected patients, with potential benefits for clinicians in deciding strategies of discontinuation or maintenance of anti-HCMV therapy."

Some DATTA panelists suggested that certain patients, such as those with Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphomas and those with concomitant human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 infection, might be considered candidates for aerosolized pentamidine regardless of T4 helper cell counts. There is no current literature to support this, and this opinion is based solely on clinical experience. Perhaps the use of other markers of immune function (beta 2-microglobulin, neopterin) in conjunction with T4 helper cell counts will give a better indication of when to start primary prophylaxis. Aerosolized pentamidine is not the only potential prophylactic regimen for PCP. Other drugs, including pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and dapsone, are currently being evaluated. Prior diagnosis and therapy for patients with M tuberculosis must occur before initiation of the use of aerosolized pentamidine. This and other appropriate environmental precautions should reduce transmission of M tuberculosis to health care workers and other patients. Whether any prophylactic treatment of an opportunistic infection will prolong survival in HIV-infected individuals has yet to be proved. The assumption is made, however, that a reduction in opportunistic infections should lower mortality and improve the quality of life."
7938,0.001,1.0000,"Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease and the important role that viral load plays in the initial selection of antiretroviral therapy significantly alters our management of this disease. Guidelines from the British HIV Association, International AIDS Society-USA, and United States Public Health Service panels regarding the selection of appropriate antiretroviral therapy, and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, have recently been published. Despite tremendous advances in treating the disease and its related complications, a comprehensive, long-term disease management plan that includes recognition of patient concerns about quality of life is lacking. New approaches to managing HIV disease must now include strategies that address patient concerns about fatigue, gastrointestinal distress, malnutrition, and weight loss. Patients must become more involved in decisions about selection of specific drugs and drug regimens and must be consulted about their expectations and needs. We have made significant strides in the treatment of HIV disease. We can readily reduce the viral burden to virtually undetectable levels, and we must continue to develop even more potent and tolerable treatment regimens. We can make patients live longer. Helping patients live better quality lives deserves further study."
9989,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global public health challenge, with an estimated 1.4 million patients worldwide. Co-infection with HIV leads to challenges in both the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Further, there has been an increase in rates of drug resistant tuberculosis, including multi-drug (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDRTB), which are difficult to treat and contribute to increased mortality. Because of the poor performance of sputum smear microscopy in HIV-infected patients, newer diagnostic tests are urgently required that are not only sensitive and specific but easy to use in remote and resource-constrained settings. The treatment of co-infected patients requires antituberculosis and antiretroviral drugs to be administered concomitantly; challenges include pill burden and patient compliance, drug interactions, overlapping toxic effects, and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Also important questions about the duration and schedule of anti-TB drug regimens and timing of antiretroviral therapy remain unanswered. From a programmatic point of view, screening of all HIV-infected persons for TB and vice-versa requires good co-ordination and communication between the TB and AIDS control programmes. Linkage of co-infected patients to antiretroviral treatment centres is critical if early mortality is to be prevented. We present here an overview of existing diagnostic strategies, new tests in the pipeline and recommendations for treatment of patients with HIV-TB dual infection."
8753,0.001,1.0000,"An association of increased weight with a slower progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease has been reported in studies that have not included large numbers of women. We evaluated the association of HIV disease progression with body mass index (BMI) in 871 women and present cross-sectional, survival, and longitudinal analyses. A higher baseline BMI was associated with a lower rate of occurrence of the first CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm(3). In analyses that incorporated time-varying BMI, underweight and normal women had an increased risk of clinical acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and underweight women had increased risk of HIV-related death, compared with obese women. The association between change in BMI and CD4 cell count was estimated; increases in BMI were associated with slight increases in CD4 cell counts, even after controlling for prior values of CD4 cell count, viral load, and treatment. Higher BMI and increases in BMI are associated with a decreased risk of HIV progression."
68,0.001,1.0000,"The authors have successfully used combination ganciclovir and foscarnet chemotherapy to control viral replication following liver transplantation in a patient with severe recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The disease was characterized by extremely high viraemias, deteriorating liver function, and high levels of intra-hepatic hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Treatment resulted in a greater than 30-fold reduction in serum HBV DNA and HBsAg levels. Liver function tests returned to normal and the histological progression of the disease was arrested. Hepatic cytoplasmic HBsAg decreased substantially but there was little change in HBcAg, implicating HBsAg rather than HBcAg in the liver injury. Combination antiviral chemotherapy using agents such as ganciclovir and foscarnet may offer a new approach to the management of post-transplant recurrence of HBV."
4572,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence of anemia in HIV-infected persons has not been well characterized in the HAART era. In a single-center, retrospective study, anemia prevalence and risk factors, including use of HAART, were assessed in an ambulatory clinical cohort of 758 HIV-infected patients for the calendar year 2000. The relationships between anemia (hemoglobin level less than 12.5 g/dL) and demographic variables, antiretroviral treatment regimens, and disease markers were analyzed. Mean baseline patient characteristics were hemoglobin level, 13.7 +/- 1.9 g/dL; CD4+ cell count, 405 +/- 293/microL; and HIV RNA level, 77,841 +/- 148,394 copies/mL. Overall anemia prevalence was 30.3%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that anemia was associated with a CD4+ cell count below 50/microL, female sex, black race, a viral load above 100,000 copies/mL, zidovudine use, and older age. Severe anemia was less prevalent in this study population than in historical comparators; however, mild to moderate anemia rates remain high."
8600,0.001,1.0000,"Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at risk for a variety of liver diseases. We undertook a retrospective study of 501 HIV-seropositive patients to assess the yield of percutaneous liver biopsy. The most common indications for liver biopsy were liver test abnormalities (89.5%), fever for 2 weeks (71.9%), and hepatomegaly (52.0%). The most common biopsy-derived diagnosis was Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), seen in 87 (17.4%) biopsies. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in 13 biopsies (2.6%). In 28 biopsies (5.6%) mycobacteria was seen, but speciation of the organism was not possible. Chronic active viral hepatitis was seen in 60 biopsies (12.0%). Opportunistic hepatic infection from other organisms was found in 14 biopsies (2.8%). The most common neoplasm was lymphoma, which was seen in 12 biopsies (2.4%). MAC infection of the liver was associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.01). Among patients with fever for 2 weeks after an extensive negative workup including bone marrow biopsy, 58.2% had a diagnosis by liver biopsy. Overall, 64.3% of liver biopsies yielded a histopathological diagnosis, 45.7% of which were potentially treatable. We could not evaluate whether liver biopsy had a positive effect on patient outcome and survival, nor did we attempt to prove that liver biopsy resulted in a change in treatment or a change in preprocedure clinical diagnosis. Thus, questions about the efficacy of liver biopsy cannot be answered. Liver biopsy may be a helpful diagnostic tool in HIV-positive patients with fever, liver test abnormalities or hepatomegaly."
2882,0.001,1.0000,"The source and dynamics of persistent HIV-1 during long-term combinational antiretroviral therapy (cART) are critical to understanding the barriers to curing HIV-1 infection. To address this issue, we isolated and genetically characterized HIV-1 DNA from naïve and memory T cells from peripheral blood and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) from eight patients after 4-12 y of suppressive cART. Our detailed analysis of these eight patients indicates that persistent HIV-1 in peripheral blood and GALT is found primarily in memory CD4(+) T cells [CD45RO(+)/CD27((+/-))]. The HIV-1 infection frequency of CD4(+) T cells from peripheral blood and GALT was higher in patients who initiated treatment during chronic compared with acute/early infection, indicating that early initiation of therapy results in lower HIV-1 reservoir size in blood and gut. Phylogenetic analysis revealed an HIV-1 genetic change between RNA sequences isolated before initiation of cART and intracellular HIV-1 sequences from the T-cell subsets after 4-12 y of suppressive cART in four of the eight patients. However, evolutionary rate analyses estimated no greater than three nucleotide substitutions per gene region analyzed during all of the 4-12 y of suppressive therapy. We also identified a clearly replication-incompetent viral sequence in multiple memory T cells in one patient, strongly supporting asynchronous cell replication of a cell containing integrated HIV-1 DNA as the source. This study indicates that persistence of a remarkably stable population of infected memory cells will be the primary barrier to a cure, and, with little evidence of viral replication, this population could be maintained by homeostatic cell proliferation or other processes.

9052,0.001,1.0000,"Mice immunized with the regulatory genes nef, rev, and tat from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 developed both humoral and cellular immune responses to the gene products Nef, Rev, and Tat. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to induce immune reactions to all of these regulatory gene products. Humoral responses were seen after DNA boosts, while potent T-cell proliferative responses were noted already after a single immunization. A Th1-directed immune response was demonstrated early after immunization. A 3- to 75-fold-stronger T-cell response was seen in animals receiving DNA epidermally compared to that in animals receiving intramuscular injections. Nef, Rev, and Tat putative B- and T-cell epitopes were clearly mapped by using peptides derived from the regulatory proteins and were similar to those which are detected in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Although immunization by the Nef, Rev, and Tat proteins raised high immunoglobulin G titers in serum, the epitope spreading appeared broader after DNA immunization. The combination of all of these regulatory genes together with two genes for structural proteins, the envelope and gag genes, demonstrated that a combined approach is feasible in that reactivities to all antigens persisted or were even augmented. No interference between plasmids was noted."
4782,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma throughout the world. Considerable evidence indicates that the risk of viral persistence, natural history, and response to antiviral therapy varies among racial groups, but limited data exist on potential mechanisms to account for these differences. Type 1 helper (Th1) responses to HCV proteins and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigens were examined using a sensitive interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay in 187 Caucasian American (CA) and 187 African American (AA) patients with chronic genotype 1 infection. ELISPOT responses were examined relative to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles and outcome of therapy with pegylated IFN and ribavirin. Th1 responses specific to hepatitis C core protein and combined HCV antigens were significantly lower in AAs compared to CAs, but CMV responses were comparable in the 2 races. The HCV difference in immunity remained after adjusting for gender, serum alanine aminotransferase, histologic severity, and viral level, and was not accounted for by the differential prevalence of human leukocyte antigen class II alleles. Pretreatment total HCV-specific CD4+ T cell response was associated with sustained virologic response (SVR) to pegylated IFN and ribavirin; 43% of patients who had more than 168 ELISPOTs/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (above background) experienced SVR compared to 28% of those who did not (P= 0.007). ELISPOT response was independently associated with SVR by multivariable analysis."

The prevalence of IgM anti-preS2 (14-21) antibody titers > 1,000 for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was 38% (22/58) and 10% (2/21) for HBeAg-negative subjects (P < 0.005). IgM anti-preS2 (14-21) reactivity was detected during the clinical course of chronic HBV infection and IgM anti-peptide antibody titers declined and disappeared before spontaneous HBe/anti-HBe seroconversion. Recombinant interferon (IFN)-alpha 2b with an antecedent short course of corticosteroids was administered to eight Chinese patients with chronic HBV infection. The IgM anti-preS2 (14-21) reactivity was monitored consecutively during treatment and patients were followed for more than 1 year. A close association between the presence of pretreatment IgM anti-preS2 (14-21) in serum and the capacity to respond favorably to the combined prednisone/IFN-alpha 2b therapy was detected. The IgM anti-preS2 (14-21) titers decreased during treatment with subsequent loss of detectable antibodies 8-16 weeks after the initiation of therapy. This decrease was concomitant with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) augmentation preceding the disappearance of HBV-DNA and anti-HBe seroconversion. Long-term remission was not observed in treated patients who lacked detectable levels of pretreatment IgM anti-preS2 (14-21) in the circulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The 5 men and 5 women black (4 Haitians, 3 Zairians, 2 Congolese and 1 Angolan). Their mean age was 31.7 +/- 4 years. No known risk factor was identified and transmission was probably heterosexual. When renal disease was diagnosed, 4 patients had AIDS, 5 had ARC and 1 was asymptomatic. Kidney biopsies were performed in 7 patients: 4 HIV-associated nephropathies (HIV AN) with segmental and focal hyalinizations, 1 thrombotic angiopathy, and 2 interstitial nephropathies, 1 with proliferative glomerulonephritis. The clinical, biological and radiographic patterns of 2 of the remaining 3 patients were suggestive of HIV AN. Four of the 6 patients with HIV AN developed end-stage renal disease within 5 +/- 2.5 months; renal function in the other 2 remained stable for 25 and 41 months, respectively, while they were receiving zidovudine, but deteriorated rapidly within weeks of withdrawing this drug. Zidovudine may have delayed the evolution of the nephropathies in these patients."
7335,0.001,1.0000,"We report a large monocentric case series of 82 patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). No germline mutations of the PPH1 gene (bone morphogenetic protein receptor-II) were found in any of the 19 patients tested. PAH was the direct cause of death in 72% of cases. Survival rates of the overall population at 1, 2, and 3 years were 73, 60, and 47%, respectively. Survival was significantly poorer in patients in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV at the time of diagnosis, as compared with those in functional class I-II with respective rates of 60, 45, and 28% versus 100, 90, 84% at 1, 2, and 3 years (p < 0.0001). Subsequently, we analyzed prognostic factors in patients in functional class III-IV. Univariate analysis indicated that CD4 lymphocyte count of more than 212 cells mm(-3), the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), and epoprostenol infusion were related with a better survival. On multivariate analysis only CD4 lymphocyte count was an independent predictor of survival, presumably because CART and epoprostenol infusion were strongly linked in our patient population. These results suggest that patients with severe human immunodeficiency virus-associated PAH should be considered for long-term epoprostenol infusion in association with CART."
6523,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence of human immunodeficience virus (HIV) infection among patients under renal replacement therapy varies, with estimates of 1% for Europe and 1.5% for the United States. Survival in HIV infected individuals receiving renal replacement therapy has improved since the introduction of high activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Current experience in renal transplantation in HIV-infected patients in the United States indicates that the three-year survival rate is similar to that of HIV-negative transplant recipients, with virological and immunological control of the infection by HAART and no increase in the number of opportunistic infections or tumors. The criteria for selecting renal transplantation candidates in this population are the following: no aids-defining events, CD4 cells > 200 cells/.l and undetectable viral load under HAART. In Spain, where most of these patients are former drug abusers, a two-year period of abstinence from cocaine and heroine abuse is also required, although patients can be participating in the methadone program. The main problems in the post-transplantation period have been interactions between HAART and immunosuppressive drugs, management of hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection and the high rate of acute rejection. To date, seven such renal transplantations have been performed in Spain, with favorable patient and graft survival and no progression to aids."
6806,0.001,1.0000,"Baseline HIV-1 resistance data are important for resistance monitoring purposes especially in regions initiating large-scale antiretroviral treatment programs. We examined 40 protease and 35 reverse transcriptase amino acid sequences of HIV-1 subtype C from drug inexperienced patients from rural settings in South Africa for resistance mutations. Samples were collected between 2001 and 2004 prior to the availability of antiretrovirals through public health institutions. Ninety-five percent of patients had no major mutations in the protease gene, although substitutions M46L (2.5%) and G73S (2.5%), which according to the Stanford Genotypic Resistance Interpretation Algorithm are considered major mutations, were detected. In addition, a high prevalence of minor mutations was observed in the protease, with at least three minor resistance-associated mutations in 37% of the isolates. An isoleucine insertion at codon 37 was detected in one sequence. Most of the RT sequences were wild-type, although V118I (8.5%) and Y318F (5.7%) associated with resistance to lamivudine and nevirapine, respectively, were observed. Our data suggest that major resistance mutations among the drug-inexperienced population in South Africa may be rare, and routine resistance testing before the initiation of therapy in this initial stage of the treatment program may not be necessary."
6730,0.001,1.0000,"Factors that contribute to the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), especially drug-resistant HIV-1 variants remain a significant public health concern. In-depth phylogenetic analyses of viral sequences obtained in the screening phase from antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients seeking enrollment in EPZ108859, a large open-label study in the USA, Canada and Puerto Rico (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00440947) were examined for insights into the roles of drug resistance and epidemiological factors that could impact disease dissemination. Viral transmission clusters (VTCs) were initially predicted from a phylogenetic analysis of population level HIV-1 pol sequences obtained from 690 antiretroviral-naïve subjects in 2007. Subsequently, the predicted VTCs were tested for robustness by ultra deep sequencing (UDS) using pyrosequencing technology and further phylogenetic analyses. The demographic characteristics of clustered and non-clustered subjects were then compared. From 690 subjects, 69 were assigned to 1 of 30 VTCs, each containing 2 to 5 subjects. Race composition of VTCs were significantly more likely to be white (72% vs. 60%; p = 0.04). VTCs had fewer reverse transcriptase and major PI resistance mutations (9% vs. 24%; p = 0.002) than non-clustered sequences. Both men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) (68% vs. 48%; p = 0.001) and Canadians (29% vs. 14%; p = 0.03) were significantly more frequent in VTCs than non-clustered sequences. Of the 515 subjects who initiated antiretroviral therapy, 33 experienced confirmed virologic failure through 144 weeks while only 3/33 were from VTCs. Fewer VTCs subjects (as compared to those with non-clustering virus) had HIV-1 with resistance-associated mutations or experienced virologic failure during the course of the study. Our analysis shows specific geographical and drug resistance trends that correlate well with transmission clusters defined by HIV sequences of similarity. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the utility of molecular and epidemiological analysis of VTCs for identifying population-specific risks associated with HIV-1 transmission and developing effective local healthcare strategies.

173,0.001,1.0000,"Data on the development of antiretroviral drug resistance in HIV-1-infected children receiving protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) are limited. We examined antiretroviral resistance among a cohort of 323 South African HIV-infected children <2 years old exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Ritonavir (RTV) was used initially for 138 children who were <6 months old or receiving antimycobacterial therapy; otherwise children received lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based ART. HIV-1 population sequencing of the pol gene was conducted on all pretreatment samples and on posttreatment samples for children who did not achieve HIV-1 plasma RNA <400 copies/ml by 52 weeks. Among children in the cohort, 38 died, 22 had <24 weeks follow-up, 209 achieved virologic suppression, and 54 did not. Of 41 children without virologic suppression with posttreatment HIV genotype data available, major resistance mutations were found in 32 (78%): 14 (36%) had PI mutations including V82A, M46I, and L90M; 29 (71%) had M184V/I; and three had NNRTI mutations (K103N, Y181C, and G190A). Among the children who did not achieve virologic suppression, none of the seven children treated exclusively with LPV/r developed PI-related mutations, compared with 14 of 32 (44%) who received RTV-based regimens (p=0.036); PI genotypes were unavailable for two children. Seventy-eight percent of children without virologic suppression developed resistance mutations that impact second-line ART options. Only children who received RTV-based ART developed major PI-related resistance mutations, and use of this regimen should be avoided."
5832,0.001,1.0000,"In some patients with chronic liver disease induced by hepatitis B virus, viral DNA is known to persist in low concentration in serum after seroconversion to hepatitis B surface antibody-positivity. This phenomenon has, however, not been documented in asymptomatic black African carriers of hepatitis B virus. Using nested amplification by the polymerase chain reaction, we detected low concentrations of hepatitis B virus DNA in the serum of 6 of 23 (26%) healthy black African adults with normal liver function and with hepatitis B virus surface antibody as the only serological marker of the virus. This finding offers one explanation for the earlier observation of integrated hepatitis B virus DNA in hepatocellular carcinomas in black Africans whose serum was positive for surface antibody alone. A number of genetic changes were found in the six isolates that might be responsible for evasion of the immune response and persistence of the virus. Isolated mutations were detected in the ""a"" determinant of the surface gene and in the encapsidation signal. In all five isolates sequenced in the core promoter, mutations were present in the upstream regulatory region. Recombination between genotypes A and D was present in three of the isolates, including both of those in which the entire genome was sequenced. This change in genotype also overlapped the amino end of the polymerase domain and may result in sufficiently low levels of replication to allow viral persistence. Topoisomerase 1 specific trinucleotides were concentrated in the vicinity of the recombination breakpoints."

Fewer than 1% gave a history of jaundice or liver disease. Risk factors for anti-HCV included increasing age, low socioeconomic status and a history of blood transfusion or injection therapy for schistosomiasis. Sub-analyses after stratification of subjects by village revealed risks associated with specific venues for medical care, having a previous delivery attended by a traditional birth assistant (TBA), receiving medical care in a temporary clinic located in a mosque, overnight admission to a private doctor's clinic, and circumcision by a TBA or a 'health barber'. Our results suggest HCV causes very little detected illness in young adult Egyptian women and some sources of HCV transmission in rural Egypt in the past were associated with the provision of medical care and varied by location. Prevention should be focused on providing appropriate resources and health education should be given to formal and informal health care providers and should be sufficiently broad to adjust for local variations in exposures."
5690,0.001,1.0000,"T-cell immunity to hepatitis B virus (HBV) is involved in both viral clearance and the pathogenesis of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma following chronic HBV infection. It is therefore of great interest to analyze whether genetic polymorphism of genes involved in the immune response may determine the outcomes of chronic HBV infection. Here we report that CD24 polymorphisms affect the risk and progression of chronic HBV infection. Thus the CD24 P170(T) allele, which is expressed at a higher level, is associated with an increased risk of chronic HBV infection. Among the chronic HBV patients this allele shows recessive association with more rapid progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in comparison to the P170(C) allele. In contrast, a dinucleotide deletion at position 1527-1528 (P1527(del)), which reduces CD24 expression, is associated with a significantly reduced risk of chronic HBV infection. To confirm the role for CD24 in liver carcinogenesis, we compared the size of liver tumor developed in CD24(-/-) and CD24(+/-) HBV transgenic mice. Our data demonstrate that targeted mutation of CD24 drastically reduced the sizes of spontaneous liver cancer in the HBV transgenic mice."
74,0.001,1.0000,"In Canada, universal and publicly funded hepatitis B immunization programs have been available since 1998 in all provinces and territories. This present study estimates the proportion of having vaccine-induced immunity to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and its associated determinants among street-involved youth aged at 15-24 years old in Canada using the data collected by the Enhanced Surveillance of Canadian Street Youth. Vaccine-induced immunity was identified by blood test results of anti-HBc negative and anti-HBs positive. Of the 4,035 participants included in this study, the overall proportion of those with vaccine-induced immunity to HBV was 51.7% during the study period compared to over 90% among the general adolescent population. The proportion of street-involved youth immunized with HBV vaccine increased from 34.7% in 1999 to 64.4% in 2005. Immunity was higher among females (aOR = 1.43, 1.17-1.75) and among those with a reported history of sexually transmitted infection (aOR = 1.30, 1.03-1.63). The proportion of youth with the immunity decreased as age increased (aOR = 0.78, 0.76-0.81, per year increase). Despite an overall increase in the proportion of Canadian street-involved youth with vaccine-induced immunity to HBV, the proportion was still significantly lower than that observed in the general adolescent population. This highlights the need to improve the access to basic health care and the immunization programs to HBV for street-involved youth through creative outreach programs and other multi-faceted approaches."
8427,0.001,1.0000,"In Taiwan, injecting drug use has been the main route of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission since 2005, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) also having similar transmission routes. This has now become an important public health issue. The aim of this study is to explore the conditions of HDV infections between injecting drug users (IDUs) with and without HIV infection in Southern Taiwan. In this study, 87 IDUs were enrolled, including 27 anti-HDV seronegative IDUs and 60 anti-HDV seropositive IDUs, and the results of their liver function tests, CD4 cell counts, and anti-HIV and HIV RNA levels were analyzed. The prevalence of anti-HDV seropositivity among hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositive IDUs in this study was 68.9% (60/87). The prevalence rate of anti-HDV seropositive IDUs among anti-HIV seronegative and anti-HIV seropositive cases was 40.0% (12/30) and 84.2% (48/57), respectively. Anti-HIV seropositivity was related to anti-HDV seropositivity (odds ratio = 9.34, 95% confidence interval = 2.67-31.59, p < 0.001). Among IDUs with HIV infection, there was no significant difference in CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA viral load between HBsAg-positive patients with anti-HDV seronegativity and those with anti-HDV seropositivity. In conclusion, the prevalence of HDV infection among IDUs is higher among IDUs with HIV infection. Because anti-HIV seropositivity is significantly related to anti-HDV seropositivity, HDV infection among IDUs is still important. We suggest that for IDUs, HBsAg and anti-HDV should be monitored closely."
4649,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health problem worldwide. The mechanism of susceptibility to chronic persistent HBV infection is not well clarified, while the outcome of HBV infection mainly depends on the host immune response. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecule is an integral component of the immune response on which majority of host genetic studies have concentrated. Many different HLA class II alleles have been demonstrated to play roles in HBV infection. In this study, the association between HBV infection and HLA-DRB1 alleles in Han individuals in northwestern China was studied for the first time. Two hundred and fifty Shaanxi Han individuals were categorized into three different groups: the HBV-infected patient group (n = 108), the spontaneously cleared control group (n = 108) and the unexposed group (n = 34). DRB1*04, DRB1*09, DRB1*12 and DRB1*15 were the most common genotypes in all the groups. The allele frequencies of HLA-DRB1*03 [10.6% of HBV-infected patients vs 3.7% of spontaneously cleared controls, odds ratios (OR) = 3.10, Pc = 0.008, P < 0.05] and HLA-DRB1*07 (17.6% of HBV-infected patients vs 9.3% of spontaneously cleared controls, Pc = 0.016, OR = 2.09, P < 0.05) were markedly higher in the HBV-infected group. But the allele frequencies of HLA-DRB1*15 (6.9% of HBV-infected patients vs 13.4% of spontaneously cleared controls Pc = 0.039, OR = 0.48, P < 0.05) were obviously lower than that of the spontaneously cleared controls. The above data indicate that HLA-DRB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*07 are related to susceptibility to chronic HBV infection, and DRB1*15 is negatively related to persistence to chronic HBV infection among people in northwestern China. Similar results were got for DRB1*03 and 15 alleles between the HBV-infected patients (n = 108) and 46 HBV seronegative spouses of the HBV patients, who were high-risk group for HBV infection. The above results suggest that host HLA class II gene is an important factor in determination of the outcome of HBV infection."
255,0.001,1.0000,"A patient with HIV infection developed the first episode of AIDS-defining opportunism (severe Candida albicans esophagitis) with an underlying CD4+ lymphocyte count of 1,025 cells/microL. After treatment with a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), taken with insufficient compliance and leaving a residual viral load, our patient suffered from two relapses of esophageal candidiasis, which occurred three months and seven years later, when his CD4+ lymphocyte count was 930 and 439 cells/microL, respectively, and a viral load slightly above 10(4) copies/mL was still present. Also in the HAART era, Candida esophagitis remains one of the most common AIDS-defining diseases, but a presentation with a concurrent CD4+ count above 1,000 cells/microL remains a rare exception, as well as the two isolated, subsequent relapses, occurred with a CD4+ count ranging from 439 to 930 cells/microL, and a residual HIV viremia due to insufficient adherence to the prescribed HAART regimens. Our case report represents the opportunity to revisit the epidemiology and, especially, the pathogenesis of this opportunistic fungal complication in HIV-infected patients and in other subjects at risk, on the ground of an extensive literature review, and to explore possible alternative supporting factors other than the crude absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count, with emphasis on the possible role of a persisting HIV viremia, and other potential contributing factors. Clinicians engaged with immunocompromised patients and subjects with HIV disease, should be aware that a Candida esophagitis may occur and relapse also when the cell-mediated immunity, as measured by a simple CD4+ cell count, do not show relevant abnormalities."
9381,0.001,1.0000,"Kidney involvement in children with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is increasing in prevalence in parallel with the longer survival of HIV-infected patients and the side-effects of new antiretroviral drugs. However, there are only a few reports describing renal tubular disorders in HIV+ children. This is a cross-sectional, case series study evaluating kidney disease in 26 Venezuelan HIV-infected children. The study cohort consisted of 15 girls and 11 boys, with a median age of 5.9 years (25-75th percentile: 3.6-7.8), who had been treated with antiretrovirals for 2.8 +/- 0.4 years, Overall, the patients were short for their age and gender (Z-height: -3.1; 25-75th percentile: -4.94 to -1.98), and 15 showed signs of mild to moderate malnutrition. All of the children had a normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (136 +/- 22.6 ml/min/1.73 m2), and glomerular involvement was only observed in one patient with isolated proteinuria. None had nephromegaly. In contrast, tubular disorders were commonly found. Hypercalciuria was detected in 16 of the patients (UCa/Cr = 0.28; 25-75th percentile: 0.17-0.54 mg/mg), with five of these showing crystalluria. Eight children showed hyperchloremia, and three had frank metabolic acidosis. Kidney stones were absent in all, but one boy had bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis. Conclusion, in Venezuelan children, HIV infection per se, or its specific treatment, was commonly associated with renal tubular dysfunction, especially hypercalciuria and acidosis, potentially leading to nephrocalcinosis and growth impairment. We recommend renal tubular evaluation during the follow-up of children with HIV infection."
1948,0.001,1.0000,Minnesota is currently home to the tenth largest African population and the second largest East African population in the United States. HIV is increasingly being diagnosed in African-born persons in Minnesota. A retrospective survey was conducted on all African-born patients in our HIV clinic between January 1994 and June 2005. We identified 237 patients who were African-born and HIV-positive. They constituted 12% of patients attending the clinic within the study timeframe. There was no significant difference in the ages of the African-born and non-African patients in the HIV clinic. African-born patients were more likely to be women compared with non-African patients (p < 0.001). Forty-three percent of the African-born patients presented with AIDS as defined by CD4(+) T cell counts less than 200 cells per milliliter compared to 33% of antiretroviral naïve non-African HIV patients in the clinic (p < 0.001). Most patients were infected through heterosexual contact and only 4% were diagnosed as a result of routine testing. Seven known HIV subtypes and four unique recombinant forms were identified. The most common opportunistic infection was pulmonary tuberculosis. African immigrants with HIV appear to: (1) access care at later stages of HIV disease than other patients in our clinic; (2) are often infected with non-B subtypes; (3) do not routinely get tested for HIV. Increased awareness to this growing trend is needed for health care providers and public health officials to tailor educational programs and prevention efforts for African immigrants in the United States.
6336,0.001,1.0000,"Approximately 15-20% of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus will develop severe neurological disease. This may be due in part to virus-induced release of a number of putative neurotoxins. However, there is little information to predict which individuals will progress to dementia or the precise mechanisms that drive pathogenesis. In an effort to identify early markers of neurological disease progression we used an in vitro bioassay with rat cortical neurons to test for the presence of toxins in CSF from 40 HIV-infected humans with mild, minimal or no neurological disease. A subset of HIV-infected individuals was found to have significant toxic activity in CSF indicating that toxic factors may be circulating prior to the development of dementia. The toxicity was concentration dependent and due to a factor with a molecular mass of less than 30 kDa. Only a small proportion of the cell death appeared to be due to apoptosis. Neuronal toxicity was associated with a gradual accumulation of intracellular calcium in a subset of cortical neurons over a period of 1-2 h and in the absence of a significant acute response. Individuals with both high viral burden and high CSF toxicity were significantly more likely to have neurological symptoms. These initial analyses indicate that toxic factors are present in the CSF of HIV-infected patients that could serve as useful markers of neurological disease progression and provide insights into pathogenic mechanisms in vivo."
1780,0.001,1.0000,"Viral tropism plays an important role in HIV pathogenesis. However, its correlation with the clinical outcome and following exposure to antiretroviral drugs are still unclear. HIV-1 co-receptor usage was examined in 206 infected individuals: 67 seroconverters, 52 chronically drug-naïve, and 87 antiretroviral-experienced patients. The V3 loop was sequenced from plasma HIV-RNA and co-receptor usage was inferred using a phenotype predictor software (http://genomiac2.ucsd.edu:8080/wetcat/v3.html), which classifies V3 sequences as R5 or X4. The overall prevalence of X4 viruses was 26.2%, with significant differences among groups: 13.4% in seroconverters, 25% in drug-naïve, and 36.8% in antiretroviral- experienced patients (P = 0.001). The presence of X4 variants in the latter group was associated with higher viral load (P = 0.002) but not with lower CD4 counts. There was no association between HIV tropism and gender, transmission route or age. Neither with the CCR5 Delta32 genotype. Moreover, no association was found between HIV-1 tropism and drug resistance mutations nor with failure to regimens based on either protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Finally, no significant association was found between IL-7 plasma levels with HIV-1 tropism. In summary, X4 viruses are particularly frequent among antiretroviral-experienced patients with high viral loads, irrespective of the CD4 count. Thus, CCR5 antagonists should be used with special caution in this subset of patients."
6689,0.001,1.0000,"One of the hallmarks of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes which precedes the progression from an asymptomatic state to AIDS. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is one of the mechanisms proposed to mediate this depletion. Infectious and inactivated preparations of HIV-1LAI were compared for their potential to induce apoptosis. Analysis with fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the DNA intercalative compound propidium iodide demonstrated that apoptosis occurred only with infectious HIV-1, implying that cell surface binding and signalling by the virus alone were insufficient to trigger apoptosis. Apoptosis was further confirmed by the presence of characteristic digestion of host cell DNA and morphologically by nuclear condensation observed by transmission electron microscopy. HIV infection of CD4+ T cell lines generated an accumulation of the cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and cells undergoing apoptosis appeared to originate from the pool of cells in the G1 phase. Inhibitors of HIV replication were used to identify the point in the virus replicative cycle at which apoptosis is induced. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ddI, or the HIV protease inhibitor, RO31-8959 (Saquinavir), were added either 2 h before or 6 h after HIV inoculation. Only ddI inhibited HIV-induced apoptosis when added before inoculation; however, neither treatment was effective in preventing HIV-induced apoptosis when applied 6 h after inoculation. These data indicate that apoptosis requires a single round of reverse transcription and the expression of virion proteins, but not the maturation of progeny virions. Two agents which compete with HIV for binding to CD4+ T cells, dextran sulphate and the anti-CD4 MAb Leu3a, were effective at preventing apoptosis when added 6 h after infection, implying that a subsequent gp120-CD4 interaction at the surface of an infected cell was required to complete the apoptotic process."
334,0.001,1.0000,"In spite of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination, HBV infection remains an important public health problem worldwide. Although the HBV genotype distribution has been determined in some parts of South Central Asia, no survey has been conducted to determine the HBV genotype in Afghanistan. Twelve Afghan patients infected with HBV living in Afghanistan were enrolled in this study. Partial HBsAg and basic core promoter, precore, and core (BCP/preC/C) regions were amplified and subjected for direct sequencing. In parallel, precore G1896A mutation was also determined by an amplification-created restriction site method. Results revealed HBV genotype D (95% bootstrap value), sub-genotype D1 (98% bootstrap value), and subtype ayw2 in all Afghan isolates. Afghan isolates clustered in a separate branch in the D1 sub-genotype called D1', while supported by 82% bootstrap value. The percentage of intra-genotypic distance among Afghan isolates was 1.05% and inter-genotypic distance with the other genotype D was 2.87% and with other genotypes was 7.50%-11.1%. The wild-type, mixed infection, and precore mutant were found in six, two, and four HBV isolates, respectively. The A1762T/G1764A BCP dual mutation was found in one isolate. Three isolates presented single mutation in the BCP dual mutation region, whereas two showed a novel G1764T mutation. In conclusion, this preliminary study revealed HBV genotype D, sub-genotype D1, and subtype ayw2 of HBV among hepatitis B infected patients from Afghanistan. Further investigation should be carried out."
4642,0.001,1.0000,"A nationwide hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination program for neonates was launched in Iran in 1993. Despite the success of this program, concern about its long-term success still remains, because breakthrough infections due to emergence of surface mutants have been reported in immunized children. We aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of HBV and vaccine escape mutants among individuals born after the initiation of the nationwide vaccination program in Iran. This study included 1115 participants younger than 23 years old, with 223 in each age cohort. The presence of HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc was evaluated using an ELISA kit. HBV-DNA levels were measured in anti-HBc and/or HBsAg-positive subjects. PCR products were sequenced and mutations were identified. The overall HBsAg prevalence was 0.27 %. Anti-HBs and anti-HBc positive rates were 48 % and 0.18 %, respectively. Two individuals were positive for anti-HBc, one of whom was also positive for HBsAg, and the other was positive for anti-HBc only. HBV DNA was detected in three out of four anti-HBc-and /or HBsAg-positive subjects. An I195M mutation within the S gene was detected in two of the three HBV-DNA-positive cases. A very low prevalence of HBsAg and isolated anti-HBc were found in this study. The I195M mutation found in the surface gene could have been induced by immune pressure. Although the number of ''vaccine escape'' mutants found in this cohort was low, ongoing surveillance of breakthrough infections and escape mutants is still needed."
9967,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes were examined in HIV-infected patients with chronic and occult HBV infection. From a total population of 593 HIV-infected patients, 22 individuals (prevalence 3.7%) were found to be HBsAg while 72 (12.1%) were found to be anti-HBc alone. From them, 20 and 4 were HBV DNA positive, respectively. These last four patients are therefore considered to be HBV infected in an occult form. The genotypes could be determined in all 24 HBV-infected patients. HBV-A was the most common (20/24; 83.3%), followed by HBV-D (2/24; 8.3%) and HBV-F (1/24; 4.2%). The remaining sample exhibited mixed infection involving genotypes A and D as pure ones, thus also forming part of three intergenotypic recombinant forms exhibiting different mosaic S gene patterns. The sexual route of transmission was predominant among HBV genotype A-infected patients. Among the 24 HBV DNA-positive patients, point mutations related to lamivudine resistance were found in four strains. These viral strains showed a methionine-to-valine substitution at codon 204 (rtM204V) in association with an upstream B-domain change at rtL180M. Additionally, two of them exhibited the additional rtV173L mutation. The value of HBV molecular monitoring including both HBV viral genomic characterization and genotypic resistance profile in HIV-HBV-coinfected individuals is discussed."
7962,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to present a definition of late presentation according to different time periods between initial diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnosis which would reliably identify individuals with high risk of mortality within 1 year of diagnosis, and could be used as a suggested common definition.Data of individuals diagnosed from 1994 to February 2012 in Wuhan, China were extracted retrospectively from the national HIV surveillance system. Four time periods (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) combined with the European consensus definition of advanced HIV disease (AHD) were compared. The predictive ability of each definition for identifying an individual who died within 1 year after HIV diagnosis was assessed.A total of 980 patients were included, of whom 289 (29.49%), 324 (33.06%), 353 (36.02%), and 387 (39.49%) were defined as AHD according to the definition of a CD4 count <200 cells/μL or AIDS-defining event (ADE) within 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of HIV diagnosis, respectively. One hundred twenty-seven (12.96%) patients died within 1 year of diagnosis. The highest Youden's index and largest area under the curve were presented in time period within 3 months. Time period within 1 month presented the highest consistency rate, positive likelihood ratio, and kappa value. Longer time periods increased the sensitivity but decreased the specificity.Given the European consensus definitions and the current results, we suggested that AHD could be defined as ""a first-reported CD4 count <200 cells/μL or an ADE within 1 month after HIV diagnosis."" ""Late presentation"" could be defined as ""a first-reported CD4 count <350 cells/μL or an ADE within 1 month after HIV diagnosis."" "
5225,0.001,1.0000,"Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a major cause of illness in HIV-infected persons. To evaluate prevalence of and risk factors for BSIs in 2,009 HIV-infected outpatients in Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam, we performed a single Myco/F Lytic blood culture. Fifty-eight (2.9%) had a clinically significant BSI (i.e., a blood culture positive for an organism known to be a pathogen). Mycobacterium tuberculosis accounted for 31 (54%) of all BSIs, followed by fungi (13 [22%]) and bacteria (9 [16%]). Of patients for whom data were recorded about antiretroviral therapy, 0 of 119 who had received antiretroviral therapy for ≥14 days had a BSI, compared with 3% of 1,801 patients who had not. In multivariate analysis, factors consistently associated with BSI were fever, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, abnormalities on chest radiograph, and signs or symptoms of abdominal illness. For HIV-infected outpatients with these risk factors, clinicians should place their highest priority on diagnosing tuberculosis."
871,0.001,1.0000,"A retrospective study was conducted to determine the mortality, causes and risk factors for death among HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Korea. The outcomes were determined by time periods, during the first year of ART and during 1-5 yr after ART initiation, respectively. Patients lost to follow-up were traced to ascertain survival status. Among 327 patients initiating ART during 1998-2006, 68 patients (20.8%) died during 5-yr follow-up periods. Mortality rate per 100 person-years was 8.69 (95% confidence interval, 5.68-12.73) during the first year of ART, which was higher than 4.13 (95% confidence interval, 2.98-5.59) during 1-5 yr after ART. Tuberculosis was the most common cause of death in both periods (30.8% within the first year of ART and 16.7% during 1-5 yr after ART). During the first year of ART, clinical category B and C at ART initiation, and underlying malignancy were significant risk factors for mortality. Between 1 and 5 yr after ART initiation, CD4 cell count ≤ 50 cells/µL at ART initiation, hepatitis B virus co-infection, and visit constancy ≤ 50% were significant risk factors for death. This suggests that different strategies to reduce mortality according to the time period after ART initiation are needed. "
7177,0.001,1.0000,"Associations of hepatitis C virus infection with Alzheimer's disease have not been studied among higher risk, bipolar disorder patients. This population-based case-control study investigated the risks of hepatitis C virus infection among Alzheimer's disease patients with bipolar disorder in the years preceding their Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. We used 2000-2013 data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database in Taiwan. Among patients with bipolar disorder, 73 were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (cases), who were compared with 365 individuals with bipolar disorder but without Alzheimer's disease (randomly selected controls matched on sex, age, and index year with cases). Prior claims (before the diagnosis year/index year for controls) were screened for a diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection. Conditional logistic regression models were used for analysis. We found that 23 (31.51%) and 60 (16.44%) patients with bipolar disease were identified with a hepatitis C diagnosis among those with and without Alzheimer's disease, respectively. Compared to controls, patients with Alzheimer's disease showed 2.31-fold (95% confidence interval = 1.28-4.16) increased risk of hepatitis C infections adjusted for demographics and socio-economic status. Findings suggest an association of Alzheimer's disease with a preceding diagnosis of hepatitis C infection among patients with bipolar disorder. Findings may suggest a need for increased awareness of and appropriate surveillance for Alzheimer's disease in patients with bipolar disorder diagnosed with hepatitis C infection."
3195,0.001,1.0000,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major cause of morbidity worldwide and a known factor leading to increased risk of death, especially in conjunction with other risk factors. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of DM among HIV-infected patients and its association with overall mortality. All HIV-infected patients 18 years or older who were followed in the Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas (INI) cohort from January 1991 to December 2011 were included. Time-updated covariables included DM status, calendar year, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and CD4 cell counts. Fixed demographic covariables included gender and age at entry. Poisson models were used to calculate mortality rate ratios (RR) with robust variances. Among the 4,871 patients included, 1,192 (24.4%) died (mortality rate = 4.72/100 person-years [PY]; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.46-5.00). Death rates were significantly higher among those presenting with DM compared with those who did not (6.16/100 vs. 4.61/100 PY, respectively. p = 0.001). In the final model, DM was significantly associated with mortality (RR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.57-1.94; p < 0.001). When the analysis was restricted to those on cART or the period post-1996, the association between DM and mortality was even stronger (RR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.91-2.46; p < 0.001 and RR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.75-2.18; p < 0.001, respectively). Among the major groups of cause of deaths (CODs), the proportion of AIDS-related conditions in patients with DM was lower (74.27% vs. 58.93%, respectively; p < 0.001); whereas in non-AIDS-related conditions, nonimmunodeficiency-related causes (22.44% vs. 34.82%, respectively; p = 0.004) were more common in patients with DM. In conclusion, DM was associated with increased mortality rates even after controlling for HIV-related variables associated to this outcome. Differences in the underlying CODs were identified, reinforcing the necessity to assess and treat comorbidities such as DM in HIV-infected patients."
7457,0.001,1.0000,"CD8(+) T cells provide protective immune responses via both cytolytic and non-cytolytic mechanisms in subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In the present study, we investigated the CD28 expression of CD8(+) T cells present in the peripheral blood lymphocyte subset isolated from chronically HIV-infected subjects. Using flow cytometric analysis, a continuous spectrum of CD28 intensity ranging from negative to high, which could be separated into CD28-negative, intermediate (int) and high, was seen for CD8(+) T cells. Our study focused mostly on the CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells. The CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells are CD57(-) CD27(+) CD45RO(+) CD45RA(-) CCR7(low) CD62L(int). The proliferative capacity of CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells was intermediate between those of CD28(-) CD8(+) T cells and CD28(high) CD8(+) T cells. The CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells are specific for HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens as measured by human leucocyte antigen pentamer binding and produce both intracellular interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in response to their cognate viral peptides. The CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells have HIV-specific, CMV-specific and EBV-specific cytotoxic activity in response to their cognate viral peptides. These findings indicate that a subset of functional effector-memory CD8(+) T cells specific for HIV, CMV and EBV antigens may contribute to an efficient immune response in HIV-infected subjects."

Quantification of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA before and after initiation of HBV-active cART in a cohort of 59 HIV-/HBV-coinfected patients was performed. Calculations of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used for the identification of predictors of HBsAg seroclearance for HBeAg-positive [HBeAg(+); n = 36] and HBeAg-negative [HBeAg(-);n = 23] patients. HBeAg(+) patients with an HBsAg on-treatment decline ≥ 1 log IU/mL per year achieved higher HBsAg loss rates (P = 0.0294), whereas the quantification of HBeAg had no predictive value for HBsAg seroclearance. Among HBeAg(-) patients, a pretreatment baseline cut-off level of HBsAg ≤ 100 IU/mL was highly predictive for HBsAg seroclearance. No significant influence of the HBV genotype on HBsAg seroclearance was observed among the entire cohort. Quantitative determination of HBsAg provides a clinically useful viral parameter for the prediction of HBsAg seroclearance both in HBeAg(+) and HBeAg(-) HIV-/HBV-coinfected patients receiving HBV-active cART."
8898,0.001,1.0000,"The association of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is unclear. To help clarify this we conducted a nationwide cohort study to measure the association by analyzing the claims data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database with ICD-9 codes used to identify diseases. We identified 17,758 adults who had chronic HBV infection and had not taken nucleos(t)ide analogs from 1999 to 2010 and randomly selected 71,032 matched controls without HBV in the same data set. The risk of ESRD was compared between these two cohorts. Cumulative incidences and hazard ratios were calculated after adjusting for competing mortality. The risk of ESRD was significantly higher in the HBV cohort (12-year cumulative incidence, 1.9%) than in the non-HBV cohort (0.49%) with a significant adjusted hazard ratio of 3.85. Multivariable stratified analysis further verified significant associations of ESRD with HBV in men of any age and women under the age of 60 years, but no significant association in women aged ⩾60 years. Thus, a large national cohort study indicates that untreated chronic HBV infection is associated with increased risk of ESRD. Hence, high-risk HBV-infected patients should have targeted monitoring for the development of ESRD. "
3338,0.001,1.0000,"We assessed the factors that influenced improvement or progression in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who were receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). This was a retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected patients receiving cART in Taizhou, Zhejiang, China, 2009-2015. Liver fibrosis was assessed by Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score. Improvement of liver fibrosis was defined as having > 30% decrease in FIB-4 from baseline, whereas progression of liver fibrosis was defined as having > 30% increase in FIB-4 score from baseline. A total of 955 HIV-infected patients were included. Of these, 808 (84.6%) were HIV-monoinfection, 125 (13.1%) were HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection and 29 (3.0%) were HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. The median duration of treatment was 15 months. After treatment, 37.1% participants had > 30% decreases in FIB-4 index, 14.8% had > 30% increases in FIB-4 index, while the remaining 48.2% had stabilized FIB-4 index. In multivariate analysis, improvement of liver fibrosis was negatively associated with an older age, but was positively associated with baseline FIB-4 index and > 30% increases in CD4 cell count after ART. Progression of liver fibrosis was positively associated with an older age, but was negatively associated with gender and HIV transmission mode (male homosexual vs. male heterosexual, female heterosexual vs. male heterosexual), and baseline FIB-4 index. Our findings indicate that improvement of liver fibrosis could be achieved by early initiation of ART through better CD4 cell recovery. Liver fibrosis and hepatotoxicity associated with ART should be monitored as early as possible and throughout till the end of treatment, with special attention to the elderly and heterosexual men."
6667,0.001,1.0000,"Integrating host and HBV characteristics, this study aimed to develop models for predicting long-term cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients. This analysis included hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-seropositive and anti-HCV-seronegative participants from the Risk Evaluation of Viral Load Elevation and Associated Liver Disease/Cancer in HBV (R.E.V.E.A.L.-HBV) cohort. Newly developed cirrhosis and HCC were ascertained through regular follow-up ultrasonography, computerized linkage with national health databases, and medical chart reviews. Two-thirds of the participants were allocated for risk model derivation and another one-third for model validation. The risk prediction model included age, gender, HBV e antigen (HBeAg) serostatus, serum levels of HBV DNA, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), quantitative serum HBsAg levels, and HBV genotypes. Additionally, the family history was included in the prediction model for HCC. Cox's proportional hazards regression coefficients for cirrhosis and HCC predictors were converted into risk scores. The areas under receiver operating curve (AUROCs) were used to evaluate the performance of risk models. Elder age, male, HBeAg, genotype C, and increasing levels of ALT, HBV DNA, and HBsAg were all significantly associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis and HCC. The risk scores estimated from the derivation set could accurately categorize participants with low, medium, and high cirrhosis and HCC risk in the validation set (P<0.001). The AUROCs for predicting 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year cirrhosis risk ranged 0.83-0.86 and 0.79-0.82 for the derivation and validation sets, respectively. The AUROC for predicting 5-year, 10-year, 15-year risk of HCC ranged 0.86-0.89 and 0.84-0.87 in the derivation and validation sets, respectively."

All AIDS patients and 68% (101/149) of the homosexual males were HIV seropositive upon entering the study. Of those 48 (32%) homosexuals who were HIV negative at the onset, three seroconverted during the two year observation period. Retrospective studies of the HIV(-) subjects' sequentially stored serum samples demonstrated an early transient appearance of gag encoded p24 antigen (Ag) which preceded their production of NA and specific anti-p24 Ab. Following their seroconversion, no more circulating p24 Ag could be detected. Among the 101 HIV positive homosexuals, 16% rapidly progressed to AIDS and seven of these 16 (44%) subjects eventually died during the two year observation period. In this group of individuals with poor prognosis, presence of NA and anti-p24 Ab commenced at the onset reaching peak levels just prior to developing AIDS and began to decline as the clinical course worsened.

3415,0.001,1.0000,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the best choice for curative treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases not suitable for surgical intervention, but efforts should be made to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence. We aimed to investigate the association between nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the risk of HCC recurrence post-RFA. Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2012, we screened 48,807 patients with newly diagnosed HBV-related HCC. We identified 850 patients (200 patients who used NAs for more than 90 days and 650 who never used NA post-RFA) who received RFA as a potentially curative treatment for HCC. Patients in the NA-treated cohort were randomly matched 1:2 with patients in the untreated cohort by age, sex, cirrhosis, and the time period between RFA and initiation of NA therapy. Finally, 133 patients were recruited in the NA-treated group and 266 in the untreated group for analysis. Cumulative incidences of and hazard ratios (HRs) for HCC recurrence were analyzed after adjusting for competing mortality. The HCC recurrence rate of the NA-treated group was significantly lower than that of the untreated group (2-year recurrence rate: 41.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 32.9-50.6 vs. 54.3%; 95% CI: 48.0-60.6; modified log-rank test: P < 0.05). In modified Cox's regression analysis, NA therapy was independently associated with a decreased risk of HCC recurrence (HR, 0.69; 95% CI: 0.50-0.95; P < 0.05). Multivariate stratified analyses verified the association of NA therapy and decreased HCC recurrence in almost all patient subgroups."
1796,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has emerged as a sexually transmitted infection among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income countries. Little is reported about HCV awareness among MSM, although this is essential for developing targeted prevention strategies. We, therefore, studied HCV awareness and knowledge among HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS). During two visits, 1 year apart and starting in October 2007, MSM from the ACS answered questions regarding HCV awareness, knowledge of HCV transmission (7 items), complications (8 items) and sexual risk behaviour. We examined the percentage of HCV awareness and correctly answered knowledge items, and whether awareness and knowledge improved significantly over time. Using logistic regression, we studied whether HIV status and sexual risk behaviour were associated with awareness. Seventy percent (312/444) of HIV-negative and 80% (74/92) of HIV-positive MSM reported to have ever heard of HCV on the first visit. Overall, awareness increased with 9% between the first and second visit (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis the association of group sex with HCV awareness was borderline significant (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.97-2.30). Compared with knowledge of transmission routes, knowledge of complications appeared to be limited. In the ACS, awareness of HCV is high, particularly among those reporting group sex, an important risk factor for HCV transmission. The majority of participants had good knowledge of transmission routes, but limited knowledge of complications of chronic HCV infection. HCV prevention messages could be strengthened, therefore, by further addressing the complications of HCV infection. "
6659,0.001,1.0000,"Thirty-six sexually active couples serologically discordant for human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), within the Baltimore Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) were assessed to determine whether evidence of HIV-1 infection could be detected in the HIV-1-antibody-negative partners and whether factors associated with lack of transmission of HIV from the seropositive to the seronegative partner could be ascertained. Six HIV-1 seropositive couples and 18 seronegative couples were followed concurrently for comparison. None of the seropositive subjects had an AIDS-defining illness at entry into the study, and all subjects were followed for 1 year. A separate evaluation of unprotected anal receptive and insertive intercourse between discordant couples indicated high-risk activities for a median of 40 months, as reported by the HIV seropositive partner. Despite this finding, none of the HIV-1 seronegative men in discordant couples had evidence of HIV-1 infection by viral culture, p24 antigen testing, or polymerase chain reaction for HIV-1 DNA. Discordant seronegatives and seropositives did not differ from concordant seronegatives and seropositives in numbers of circulating CD4, CD8, and natural killer lymphocytes or in prevalence of antibodies to herpes simplex virus, type 1, Epstein-Barr virus, or cytomegalovirus, except that discordant seronegative men were less likely than their seropositive partners to have antibodies to herpes simplex virus, type 2. The reason for the apparent lack of HIV-1 infection in seronegative discordant individuals remains unexplained and did not appear to be associated with type of sexual activity, T-lymphocyte subsets or natural killer cells, or early stage of HIV-1 disease."
9468,0.001,1.0000,"Infusional CDE (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide; iCDE) is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic regimen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), with a complete remission rate of 46% and a median overall survival of 8.2 months (Sparano JA, Blood 1993; 81:2810). Since the majority of HIV-associated NHL are CD20-positive we reasoned that the addition of rituximab to iCDE (R-iCDE) could also improve the poor outcome of these patients. As a first step we investigated the safety of R-iCDE in a phase I/II study. Thirty patients with aggressive HIV-associated NHL were enrolled between June 1998 and October 2000. Characteristics of 29 evaluable patients were: median age: 38 years (range 29-65 years); male sex 24/29; histology: DLCL 16 (55%), Burkitt 10 (35%), ALCL 2 (7%), unclassified 1 (3%); stage: I (35%), II (10%), III (10%), IV (45%); International Prognostic Index: 0, 1 (59%), 2 (24%), 3 (17%), 4, 5 (0); CD4 count: median 132/ mm3 (range 3-470/mm3). Patients received rituximab (375 mg/m2) in conjunction with iCDE (five or six cycles). All patients were treated with G-CSF and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Twenty-six of 29 patients received treatment as planned, while chemotherapy had to be discontinued in three patients (2 persistent thrombocytopenias, 1 cerebral hemorrhage). Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was observed as follows: neutropenia 79%, anemia 45%, thrombocytopenia 34%, bacterial infection 34%, opportunistic infection 7%, mucositis 17%. A dose reduction was necessary in 22%. Complete remission was achieved in 86% of the patients, partial remission in 4%. Ten percent had progressive disease. After a median follow-up of 9 months the median overall survival is not reached. The actuarial survival at 2 years is 80% and the actuarial progression-free survival is 79%. Four of 29 patients (14%) have died, three from NHL and one from cryptosporidiosis. These findings suggest that the combination of rituximab with iCDE in patients with HIV-associated NHL is safe and feasible and that the addition of the anti-CD20 antibody does not increase the risk for infections. The high complete remission rate also indicates a potential therapeutic benefit and warrants further randomized trials."
53,0.001,1.0000,"Recent analysis of antiretroviral treatment (ART) program data in Georgia showed that end-stage liver disease was a leading cause of death among HIV/HCV co infected patients in 2005. The objective of this retrospective study was to study prevailing genotypes and subtypes of HCV virus in a cohort of HIV infected patients. The investigation revealed that of 1490 patients, 879 (59%) were hepatitis C antibody positive. Detectable HCV RNA was found among 91% of patients. Median liver HCV RNA level was higher than among mono-infected patients. The most prevalent genotypes were genotype 1 (41.6%), followed by genotype 3 (34.7%) and genotype 2 (17.6%), inter (mix) genotype recombinants were found among 5.8 % of patients. The genotype distribution in our study is slightly different from what was seen in Georgia in 2000. The differences of prevailing HCV genotypes among general population and HIV co infected group was probably attributed to the different methods for sample selection used within our study or possible influence of diverse transmission networks among HIV infected group. Another explanation can be the possible shift from predominance of genotype 1 to non 1 genotypes. The higher number intergenotype recombinant forms might be the result of continues parenteral exposure to different HCV genotypes during drug injection paraphernalia. Our study demonstrated high prevalence of HCV infection among HIV-infected patients and revealed 1b as predominant genotype. IDUs were less likely to spontaneously clear the virus than homosexual man and heterosexually infected woman. A greater HCV RNA levels were associated with a greater chance to be infected with HCV genotypes 1. Possible shift from predominance of genotype 1 to non 1 genotypes can be of option. This shift may have a major and beneficial impact on treatment schedules and costs. The higher number intergenotype recombinant forms might be the results of continues parenteral exposure to different HCV genotypes during drug injection paraphernalia. Study results highlights and strengthens the need for careful follow-up of HCV/HIV co infected patients, effective management and therapies against HCV in order to reduce liver related death rates in patients on ART."
3927,0.001,1.0000,"Thrombosis of upper extremity arteries is most commonly due to atherosclerosis of the proximal subclavian artery, trauma, or catheter-related injury. In the absence of an identifiable cause, a search for a hypercoagulable state is indicated. Hematologic manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and AIDS are frequent occurrences (Coyle TE. Med Clin N Am 1997;81:449-476). The most important of these are cytopenias (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia). The incidence and severity of cytopenia are generally correlated to the stage of the HIV infection. In addition, various coagulation abnormalities have been reported in HIV-infected patients. Apart from thrombocytopenia, these have included a prolonged APTT due to the presence of lupus anticoagulant, an increased prevalence of protein S and heparin cofactor II deficiency, and hypoalbuminemia-related fibrin polymerization defects (Toulon P. Ann Bio Clin (Paris) 1998;56:153-160). HIV infection has also been associated with endothelial dysfunction. Although for the most part asymptomatic, elevated D-dimer levels have been found in HIV-infected patients, suggesting the existence of a prethrombotic state. In fact, clinical thrombosis eventuates in 2% of these patients (Toulon, 1988). Documented thromboses have involved both veins and arteries. We hereby present a patient who developed an acute thrombosis of his brachial artery as the initial manifestation of HIV infection."
5098,0.001,1.0000,"After the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), there has been a decrease in the incidence of lymphoma among the HIV-infected population and also significantly improved survival rates. We describe a remarkable case of an HIV-infected patient with advanced stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), completely regressed with the use of HAART alone. He remained disease-free for 6 years and he achieved cure without chemotherapy. Although several cases of low-grade lymphoma with complete regression were reported, we could not find any case of stage IV high-grade malignant lymphoma with HAART alone in complete remission for over 5 years from our review of the literature. This unique case shows the importance of HAART in improving survival and achieving cure in HIV-high-grade malignant lymphoma."
5042,0.001,1.0000,"Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) dramatically reduces AIDS-related complications, yet the life expectancy of long-term ART-treated HIV-infected patients remains shortened compared to that of uninfected controls, due to increased risk of non-AIDS related morbidities. Many propose that these complications result from translocated microbial products from the gut that stimulate systemic inflammation--a consequence of increased intestinal paracellular permeability that persists in this population. Concurrent intestinal immunodeficiency and structural barrier deterioration are postulated to drive microbial translocation, and direct evidence of intestinal epithelial breakdown has been reported in untreated pathogenic SIV infection of rhesus macaques. To assess and characterize the extent of epithelial cell damage in virally-suppressed HIV-infected patients, we analyzed intestinal biopsy tissues for changes in the epithelium at the cellular and molecular level. The intestinal epithelium in the HIV gut is grossly intact, exhibiting no decreases in the relative abundance and packing of intestinal epithelial cells. We found no evidence for structural and subcellular localization changes in intestinal epithelial tight junctions (TJ), but observed significant decreases in the colonic, but not terminal ileal, transcript levels of TJ components in the HIV+ cohort. This result is confirmed by a reduction in TJ proteins in the descending colon of HIV+ patients. In the HIV+ cohort, colonic TJ transcript levels progressively decreased along the proximal-to-distal axis. In contrast, expression levels of the same TJ transcripts stayed unchanged, or progressively increased, from the proximal-to-distal gut in the healthy controls. Non-TJ intestinal epithelial cell-specific mRNAs reveal differing patterns of HIV-associated transcriptional alteration, arguing for an overall change in intestinal epithelial transcriptional regulation in the HIV colon. These findings suggest that persistent intestinal epithelial dysregulation involving a reduction in TJ expression is a mechanism driving increases in colonic permeability and microbial translocation in the ART-treated HIV-infected patient, and a possible immunopathogenic factor for non-AIDS related complications."
2228,0.001,1.0000,"Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles produced by healthy and virus-infected cells. Exosomes derived from infected cells have been shown to contain viral microRNAs (miRNAs). HIV-1 encodes its own miRNAs that regulate viral and host gene expression. The most abundant HIV-1-derived miRNA, first reported by us and later by others using deep sequencing, is the trans-activation response element (TAR) miRNA. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of TAR RNA in exosomes from cell culture supernatants of HIV-1-infected cells and patient sera. TAR miRNA was not in Ago2 complexes outside the exosomes but enclosed within the exosomes. We detected the host miRNA machinery proteins Dicer and Drosha in exosomes from infected cells. We report that transport of TAR RNA from the nucleus into exosomes is a CRM1 (chromosome region maintenance 1)-dependent active process. Prior exposure of naive cells to exosomes from infected cells increased susceptibility of the recipient cells to HIV-1 infection. Exosomal TAR RNA down-regulated apoptosis by lowering Bim and Cdk9 proteins in recipient cells. We found 10(4)-10(6) copies/ml TAR RNA in exosomes derived from infected culture supernatants and 10(3) copies/ml TAR RNA in the serum exosomes of highly active antiretroviral therapy-treated patients or long term nonprogressors. Taken together, our experiments demonstrated that HIV-1-infected cells produced exosomes that are uniquely characterized by their proteomic and RNA profiles that may contribute to disease pathology in AIDS.

Irrespective of the region, thalassaemics had higher exposure rate to HBV (14.7-31.6% HBsAg; 79.4-97.9% all markers) than sickle-cell disease patients (9.4-27.5% HBsAg; 45.3-85% all markers) and controls (5.8-21.3% HBsAg; 30.8-72.5% all markers). Evidence of delta infection was found in thalassaemics from all regions (7.1-21.0%); also, the prevalence of anti-delta was higher in thalassaemics than in sickle-cell disease patients and controls. Only five thalassaemics were positive for antibody to the human immune deficiency virus (HIV). In the light of these results, screening of all donated blood for HBsAg and for anti-HIV by the most sensitive techniques is essential. Furthermore, early vaccination of Saudi children with thalassaemia and sickle-cell disease against HBV is recommended."

This study was performed by using a combined qualitative and quantitative assessment of Vbeta mRNA alterations at the level of complementary determining region 3 length distribution (CDR3-LD) of the TCR. Whereas healthy individuals displayed both stable CDR3-LD profiles and Vbeta transcript accumulations over time, the four HIV-1-infected patients in a quiescent disease phase under HAART have a highly significantly biased CDR3-LD. In addition, they displayed a significant further increase of alterations of their beta CDR3-LD profile after vaccination and both a more altered CDR3-LD (p < 0.05) and an increased transcript accumulation of some Vbeta families after HAART interruption. These modifications mostly concerned the CD8(+ve) T cells. Such a global approach of TCR alterations may help to follow the immune response of these patients and allow targeting of more complex in vivo studies by identifying the T cells with a selected repertoire."
1927,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 circulates in vivo as a mixture of heterologous populations (quasispecies). We previously analyzed the quasispecies of the third hypervariable region (V3) in the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 in an infected individual and found that the species with a basic amino acid substitution (lysine for aspartic acid) at a particular position evolved and became a distinct population within a short period, followed by progression to the typical immunodeficiency stage (S. Oka et al., AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 10:271-277, 1994). In the present study, we examined the biological significance of this amino acid substitution by constructing recombinant viruses with specific point mutations and comparing their replication capabilities in different cell types. The results demonstrated that the single basic amino acid substitution was sufficient to render a virus fully capable of replicating in human T-cell lines under certain conditions. With an acidic amino acid at the position, the virus grew much less fast or did not grow at all in the T-cell lines. Viral neutralization assay and peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays further showed that this amino acid substitution resulted in different recognition by several of the serum specimens from human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected individuals and thus could alter the antigenic structure. An additional finding worthy of note was that at the terminal stage, the proviral sequences of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the viral isolates from them were without exception of the late type with the basic amino acid substitution, whereas the early sequence without the substitution was retained as a major subset in the spleen. These results support the notion that basic amino acid substitutions in V3 are a strong predictor of virus tropism and may be relevant to disease progression."
5909,0.001,1.0000,"The absence of readily manipulable experimental systems to study the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigens has thus far precluded a definitive demonstration of the role played by this response in the pathogenesis of liver cell injury and viral clearance during HBV infection. To circumvent the problem that HBV infection of human cells in vitro for production of stimulator/target systems for CTL analysis is not feasible, a panel of 22 overlapping synthetic peptides covering the entire amino acid sequence of the HBV core (HBcAg) and e (HBeAg) antigens were used to induce and to analyze the HBV nucleocapsid-specific CTL response in nine patients with acute hepatitis B, six patients with chronic active hepatitis B, and eight normal controls. By using this approach, we have identified an HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitope, located within the NH2-terminal region of the HBV core molecule, which is shared with the e antigen and is readily recognized by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with self-limited acute hepatitis B but less efficiently in chronic HBV infection. Our study provides the first direct evidence of HLA class I-restricted T cell cytotoxicity against HBV in humans. Furthermore, the different response in HBV-infected subjects who successfully clear the virus (acute patients) in comparison with patients who do not succeed (chronic patients) suggests a pathogenetic role for this CTL activity in the clearance of HBV infection."
3190,0.001,1.0000,"This study aimed to determine the degree of clonal expansion of T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from patients suffering from different clinical types of hepatitis B (HB) infection and to analyse the clinical relevance of the skewed T-cell receptor beta variable (TCRBV). Sera and PBMCs were collected from 90 HB patients. Gene melting spectral pattern (GMSP) analysis was used to determine the distribution and expansion of populations expressing specific TCRBV complementary determined region 3 (CDR3) genes. TCRBV genes associated with monoclonal expansion were sequenced. TCRBV families from the majority of patients (80/90) displayed skewed T-cell expansion. Furthermore, TCRBV11, BV12 and BV13.1 were more frequent than other TCRBV genes; the sequence of TCRBV11 CDR3 was expressed as 'VYNEQ' in all patients and was accompanied by the BJ2.1 fragment. In patients with chronic HB, the frequency of skewed TCRBV was inversely correlated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels. The persistently skewed TCRBV gene families in HB patients may be associated with the development and maintenance of hepatitis. GMSP analysis of TCRBV gene families may be helpful in estimating disease status, and BV11 may be associated with HBV replication in patients with chronic HBV infection."
4872,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2), like HIV-1, causes AIDS and is associated with AIDS cases primarily in West Africa. HIV-1 and HIV-2 display significant differences in nucleic acid sequence and in the natural history of clinical disease. Consistent with these differences, we have previously demonstrated that the enhancer/promoter region of HIV-2 functions quite differently from that of HIV-1. Whereas activation of the HIV-1 enhancer following T-cell stimulation is mediated largely through binding of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to two adjacent kappa B sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, activation of the HIV-2 enhancer in monocytes and T cells is dependent on four cis-acting elements: a single kappa B site, two purine-rich binding sites, PuB1 and PuB2, and a pets site. We have now identified a novel cis-acting element within the HIV-2 enhancer, immediately upstream of the kappa B site, designated peri-kappa B. This site is conserved among isolates of HIV-2 and the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus, and transfection assays show this site to mediate HIV-2 enhancer activation following stimulation of monocytic but not T-cell lines. This is the first description of an HIV-2 enhancer element which displays such monocyte specificity, and no comparable enhancer element has been clearly defined for HIV-1. While a nuclear factor(s) from both peripheral blood monocytes and T cells binds the peri-kappa B site, electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that either a different protein binds to this site in monocytes versus T cells or that the protein recognizing this enhancer element undergoes differential modification in monocytes and T cells, thus supporting the transfection data. Further, while specific constitutive binding to the peri-kappa B site is seen in monocytes, stimulation with phorbol esters induces additional, specific binding. Understanding the monocyte-specific function of the peri-kappa B factor may ultimately provide insight into the different role monocytes and T cells play in HIV pathogenesis."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem that represents a significant co-morbidity event that has led to outbreaks of hepatitis B. There are inadequate data concerning occult HBV infection among Egyptian chronic hemodialysis patients. This study aimed to detect occult HBV infection among chronic hemodialysis patients in Alexandria, Egypt. A cross-sectional study was performed on 100 patients with end-stage renal disease that received maintenance hemodialysis and had tested negative for HBV surface antigen. Blood samples were collected before the initiation of hemodialysis. Sera were tested for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B core (HBc) antibodies using ELISA, and HBV DNA was detected by SYBR Green real-time PCR using specific primers for the s and c genes and by nested PCR using pol gene-specific primers. The serum activity of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST) were also measured. Anti-HCV and anti-HBc antibodies were detected in 34% and 48% of patients, respectively, and 70.6% of anti-HCV positive patients were also positive for anti-HBc antibodies. This association was statistically significant (p=0.001). HBV DNA was detected in 32% of the hemodialysis patients. A significant association was determined between the presence of HBV DNA and anti-HCV positivity (p=0.021). Aminotransferases were elevated in 21% of the studied patients, more often in patients with positive anti-HCV profiles than in patients negative for anti-HCV (p<0.05). In conclusion, the serological markers of HBV infection should be verified with molecular tests to investigate possible occult infections, especially among anti-HBc-positive hemodialysis patients, to improve our understanding of their clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological characteristics.

9021,0.001,1.0000,"The production of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) has been reported as being significantly associated with the gene polymorphism in the leader sequence at positions +29. The current study aimed to evaluate the associations between the polymorphism and the clinical characteristics of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). A total of 422 (252 men; mean age: 49.7 +/- 11.2 years) Taiwanese CHC patients with liver biopsies were enrolled. The TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism at position +29 (T or C), hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genotypes, and serum HCV RNA levels of these patients were determined. Of the 422 patients, the frequency of the T allele was 45.4%. Based on univariate analyses, a significantly lesser proportion of patients with allele T had high viral loads than those who were without allele T (P = 0.026). The lesser HCV RNA levels and HCV genotype 1b infection were significantly associated with the inheritance of the T allele in female patients based on univariate (P = 0.012 and 0.007, respectively) and multivariate regression (odds ratio/95% confidence interval: 0.434/0.219-0.859 and 0.468/0.237-0.927, respectively) analyses. In male patients with or without inheritance of the T allele, the clinical characteristics were similar. In conclusion, the association between TGF-beta1 polymorphism and virologic characteristics of chronic HCV infection implicated a significant role of host genetic factors on the clinical features of CHC. Female patients who carry T allele at position +29 were predisposed to be associated with HCV genotype non-1b infection and lesser HCV viral load, which revealed the gender effect."
3524,0.001,1.0000,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified host genetic variation to be critical for predicting treatment response and spontaneous clearance in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). These important new studies are reviewed and their future clinical implications discussed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the region of the IL28B gene on chromosome 19, coding for the interferon (IFN)-λ-3 or IL28B gene, are strongly associated with treatment response to pegylated IFN and ribavirin in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. The good response variant is associated with a twofold increase in the rate of cure. Allele frequencies differ between ethnic groups, largely explaining the observed differences in response rates between Caucasians, African Americans and Asians. IL28B polymorphism is also strongly associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV. The biological mechanisms responsible for these genetic associations remain unknown and are the focus of ongoing research. Knowledge of a patient's IL28B genotype is likely to aid in clinical decision making with standard of care regimens. Future studies will investigate the possibility of individualizing treatment duration and novel regimens according to IL28B type."
3335,0.001,1.0000,"To examine the genetic features of the long terminal repeat (LTR) derived from six HIV-1-infected individuals enrolled in the Mexico City Cohort, we cloned and sequenced a 505-bp fragment of the proviral LTR from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All patients harbored HIV-1 LTR quasispecies corresponding to the B subtype. Three patients with high CD4+ T cell counts (>500/mm3) presented LTR sequences with point mutations in the TAR bulge. The LTR sequence from a patient classified as a long-term nonprogressor (LTNP) presented the most frequent naturally occurring length polymorphism (MFNLP) and two substitutions in the TAR region that were predicted to result in two alternative secondary RNA structures. A novel 18-bp deletion, which eliminates part of the putative binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT-1), was identified in the overlapping nef/LTR sequence derived from a patient progressing to AIDS. This deletion coincides with the ability of this virus to consistently replicate at low levels in vivo (viral load <500 RNA copies/ml) and in vitro (unsuccessful virus isolation). On one occasion, when virus isolation was successful, the 18-bp deletion was no longer evident and LTR sequences with intact NFAT-1-binding sites were observed. Inoculation of hu-PBL-SCID mice with viruses from several Mexican patients resulted in differential CD4+ T cell depletion patterns 15 days postinfection, which agree with the in vivo CD4+ T cell count data from each patient."

The tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor family member-associated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activator (TANK) takes part in the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway and the interferon (IFN)-induction pathways that have relevance to HBV-related liver disease. In this report, we explored whether the intronic polymorphism rs3820998 of the TANK gene was associated with outcomes of HBV infection by binary logistic regression analysis. A total of 1305 unrelated Han Chinese patients recruited from Wuhan, including 180 acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACLF-HBV) patients, 331 HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, 308 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and 486 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsC) were genotyped using the TaqMan probe method. Logistic analysis revealed that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3820998 was significantly associated with susceptibility to ACLF-HBV (dominant model, OR 0.643, 95% CI 0.428,0.964, p=0.033; additive model, OR 0.640, 95% CI 0.414,0.990, p=0.045), and LC (recessive model, OR 0.398, 95% CI 0.164,0.966, p=0.042; additive model, OR 0.379, 95% CI 0.155,0.928, p=0.034). These results indicate that the G > T variant is a protective factor in the development of ACLF-HBV and LC, and that the SNP rs3820998 in the TANK gene may play a role in mediating susceptibility to ACLF-HBV and LC in a Chinese Han population."
5489,0.001,1.0000,"In West and West Central Africa, multiple subtypes, circulating recombinant forms (CRF), and high proportions of unique recombinant forms (URF) are documented. The predominance of recombinants strongly suggests that dual infections occur frequently. In the present study, we adapted the multi-region hybridization assay (MHA), previously developed to identify dual infections in geographic regions where few HIV-1 variants circulate, to identify HIV-1 variants and dual infections. We designed clade-specific probes in three genomic regions (gag p17, vpu, nef) to detect eight different variants that are common in this part of Africa (A, B/D, C, F, G, CRF02_AG, CRF06_cpx, CRF22_01A1). The assay was validated with 163 samples representing the corresponding HIV-1 variants. Depending on the genomic regions, the global sensitivity of the assay ranged from 86% to 94%, and the global specificity was between 85% and 96%. The assay was then applied on 156 antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from Cameroon. The MHA assay identified 79%, 85% and 90% of the strains in nef, gag and vpu regions, respectively. The subtype/CRF distribution and the proportion of inter-region recombinants obtained by the new MHA assay were in accordance with known subtype/CRF distribution in Cameroon. Moreover, the MHA assay identified 35 (22.4%) patients as dually infected, from which 20 were reactive in more than one region and/or with concordant multigenomic recombination pattern. Despite the high genetic diversity, we successfully developed an hybridization assay allowing identification of eight common HIV-1 variants circulating in West and West Central Africa. We documented high rates of dual infection in a low-risk population group, illustrating that the global evolution of HIV diversity is driven by dual infections. This assay could become a useful screening tool for the global surveillance and monitoring of inter-subtype/CRF dual infections in West and West Central Africa."
9020,0.001,1.0000,"There is an increase in the cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity in individuals infected with HIV that may be due to inflammatory lipid modulation not captured by traditional lipid measures. The objective of this study was to perform advanced lipoprotein phenotyping inclusive of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol efflux capacity and lipoprotein particle concentration and size in a well-phenotyped group of 118 patients infected with HIV. We used simple and multivariable analyses to determine the associations between advanced lipoprotein parameters and known cardiometabolic risk factors. Participants were on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) and had benign traditional lipid panels [median total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides of 178 mg/dl, 108 mg/dl, 44 mg/dl, and 122.5 mg/dl, respectively]. However, advanced lipoprotein phenotyping demonstrated an elevation of LDL particle number (median of 1,233 nmol/liter) and a decrease in LDL size (median of 20.4 nm), along with a decrease in protective, large HDL particles (median of 3.15 μmol/liter) and reduced HDL cholesterol efflux capacity in comparison to controls of other studies. HDL cholesterol efflux capacity was associated with HDL levels (β=0.395, p<0.001), small LDL particle concentration (β=-0.198, p=0.031), insulin sensitivity by the Matsuda index (β=0.218, p=0.029), and the Framingham Risk Score (β=-0.184, p=0.046). We demonstrate an atherogenic lipoprotein profile by NMR spectroscopy and HDL efflux measurement in a group of HIV-infected patients on stable ART with normal lipid panels."
6452,0.001,1.0000,"Pakistan is experiencing a growing HIV epidemic. Antiretroviral drugs (ARV) have been smuggled into the country and available without prescription since the early 1990s, but are now provided free of cost by the government. We assessed the prevalence of HIV-1, drug resistance, and subtype distributions. Blood specimens were collected from HIV-1-infected participants registered in Sindh Province on dry blood spot (DBS) cards in 2008. Pol, protease, and partial reverse transcriptase regions were sequenced after reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). HIV-1 subtype was assigned by phylogenetic analysis. Primary drug resistance was analyzed by the Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool using the Stanford Surveillance Drug Resistance Mutation (SDRM) major mutation list. Out of 100 blood samples collected, 42 were suitable for testing. Out of 42, 11 were ARV-receiving and 31 ARV-naive patients. Among them, 24 were injection drug users (IDUs), four immigrants, two hijras (male transvestites), two men who have sex with men (MSM), four prisoners, one female sex workers, two spouses of HIV-infected persons, and four from the general population. ARV resistance among naive patients was 2/31 (6.5%) and 36.4% (4/11) among ARV-experienced patients making an overall resistance of 14.2%. HIV-1 subtype A1 was the predominant subtype found in 35/42 (83.3%) followed by CRF35_AD and C, 6.5% each. Subtype D and G were found in one (2.4%) each. A significant proportion of Pakistani HIV patients has ARV drug resistance. Physicians treating patients should consider the magnitude of drug resistance while selecting regimens, and address drug adherence aggressively."
9459,0.001,1.0000,"Both serologic and molecular tools are useful for the diagnosis, monitoring and therapeutic management of viral hepatitis associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Compared with the standard tests to detect viral antigens and the antibodies directed against them, real-time PCR techniques today make it possible to quantify viral DNA more sensitively and more precisely. They thus replace the techniques previously used in most virology laboratories. New markers, such as the HBV genotype or the amino-acid substitution profile associated with HBV resistance to nucleoside and nucleotide analogs (NRTIs), can also be characterized by techniques based on sequencing or reverse hybridization. There is not currently any consensus about the first-line treatment for chronic HBV infection. Patients with a wild-type virus (HBe antigen-positive), a moderate viral load, and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (from 2 to 5 times the upper limit of normal) are good candidates for treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha. Patients who are HBe antigen-positive and do not respond to this first-line treatment, as well as patients with chronic e-antigen-negative hepatitis B, are candidates for prolonged treatment, probably lifelong, by nucleoside or nucleotide analogs. Whatever the HBe serologic status and treatment, the efficacy of antiviral treatment is assessed by repeated measurements of viral load and serum alanine aminotransferase levels, in principle, every 12-24 months. In patients who are HBe antigen-positive, the efficacy of antiviral treatment is shown by the loss of HBe antigen, followed by the appearance of anti-HBe antibodies (HBe seroconversion), a reduction in viral load below 2x10(4)IU/mL and normalization of serum aminotransferase. In patients who are HBe antigen-negative or HBe antigen-positive but do not seroconvert after short-term treatment and who receive nucleoside or nucleotide analogs, the treatment objective is for HBV DNA to become undetectable by real-time PCR. Nonetheless, this objective is not always met, and it is recommended that viral replication be maintained at the lowest possible level for the longest possible time (ideally, lifelong). In all cases, when a virologic response to treatment is observed (significant reduction in viral load) and is followed by a relapse characterized by a viral load augmentation of at least 1 Log(10)IU/mL relative to the nadir, viral resistance to treatment must be suspected, after treatment adherence has been verified."
6145,0.001,1.0000,"The purpose of this study is to elucidate the potential role of interleukin (IL)-10(+) regulatory B cells and other B cell subsets in the development of hepatitis B virus-associated membranous nephropathy (HBV-MN). A total of 14 patients with new onset HBV-MN, 12 individuals with immune-tolerant HBV infection (HBV-IT), and 12 healthy controls (HC) were examined for the percentages of CD38(+) , CD86(+) , CD27(+) , CD95(+) and IL-10(+) B cells by flow cytometry. Serum IL-10 concentration was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The percentages of CD38(+) CD19(+) , CD86(+) CD19(+) , CD38(+) CD86(+) CD19(+) , and CD95(+) CD19(+) B cells were significantly higher in HBV-MN patients than the HBV-IT and HC. The percentages of CD5(+) CD19(+) , IL-10(+) CD19(+) B cells and serum IL-10 level in HBV-MN patients were significantly higher than the HC, and lower than the HBV-IT. Percentages of CD38(+) CD19(+) , and CD86(+) CD19(+) B cells were reduced after treatment, while the percentages of CD5(+) CD1d(+) CD19(+) , CD5(+) CD1d(+) IL-10(+) CD19(+) , and IL-10(+) CD19(+) B cells were increased. The 24 h urinary protein concentration was positively correlated with the percentage of CD38(+) CD19(+) , and negatively correlated with the percentage of IL-10(+) CD19(+) B cells and serum IL-10 level. Similarly, the value of eGFR was negatively correlated with the percentage of CD38(+) CD19(+) , and positively correlated with the percentage of IL-10(+) CD19(+) B cells and serum IL-10 level. Serum IL-10 level and the percentage of IL-10(+) CD19(+) were negatively correlated with the percentages of CD38(+) CD19(+) , and CD86(+) CD19(+) B cells. These results suggest that CD86(+) CD19(+) , CD38(+) CD86(+) CD19(+) , CD95(+) CD19(+) , and especially CD38(+) CD19(+) and IL-10(+) CD19(+) cells may participate in the pathogenesis of HBV-MN. "
5966,0.001,1.0000,"Reports of in vitro resistance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to zidovudine (AZT) have raised concerns about the development of resistance to other dideoxynucleosides in clinical use. To address this, we have developed a screening assay which supports the growth of clinical isolates and have applied this to a series of paired isolates from patients entered into a phase I trial of didanosine (DDI). Thirteen patients (10 with AIDS, 3 with AIDS-related complex) who had been exposed to AZT for a mean of 6.5 months (range, 1 to 13 months) were treated with DDI at 750 mg/day. Paired isolates were obtained pretherapy and after a mean of 58 weeks (range, 21 to 90) of DDI therapy by coculture of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBLs) with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs. Isolates were passaged only one additional time in PBLs and then tested in parallel in a microtiter assay with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs as targets. PBLs were infected with 10(5) 50% tissue culture infectious doses per 10(7) cells and exposed to DDI (1 to 50 microM) or AZT (0.01 to 100 microM), and supernatants were assayed for the HIV p24 antigen at 7 days postinfection. Control AZT-susceptible and resistant isolates were included. The median pre- and posttherapy DDI susceptibilities of the 13 pairs of isolates were 10.0 microM (range, 1 to 25 microM) and 17.5 microM (range, 2.5 to 50 microM), respectively (P = 0.036; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These studies thus indicated that (i) the susceptibility to DDI tends to mildly decrease with drug exposure; (ii) the susceptibility to AZT improves with time off AZT; (iii) baseline susceptibilities to DDI have a wide range, and the CD4 response may correlate with the initial susceptibility; and (iv) a PBL-based microtiter assay is useful for screening clinical isolated for dideoxynucleoside susceptibility profiles."
9006,0.001,1.0000,"On June 4, 1981, MMWR published a report about Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in homosexual men in Los Angeles. This was the first published report. A years later, this disease was named acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In the following year, Montangier et al in France discovered the causative agent, which they called lymphadenopathy virus (LAV), now known as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1985, solid-phase enzymeimmunoassay for the detection of the antibody to HIV was developed. Since then, other new techniques for the identification of HIV infection have been become available. These include more sensitive methods (for example; polymerase chain reaction techniques). Although these techniques facilitate early and definite diagnosis of infection, these tests may fail to detect the antibody in sera during window period of infection or overdiagnose infection in sera contaminated with genes not related to HIV. Although preventing blood exposure is the primary means of preventing occupationally acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, appropriate post-exposure management is an important element of workplace safety. Information suggesting that zidovudine (ZDV) postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) may reduce the risk for HIV transmission after occupational exposure to HIV infected blood prompted a Public Health Service (PHS) interagency working group, with expert consultation, and recommendations on PEP and management of occupational exposure to HIV in relation to these findings were discussed."
3926,0.001,1.0000,"The objectives of this study were first, to identify psychosocial and medical service utilization factors associated with unprotected sex with HIV-negative or unknown serostatus partners among persons living with HIV/AIDS, and second, to identify risk behaviours associated with HIV medical service use. We assessed 244 HIV-positive participants in an HIV intervention targeting drug users (1997-99). Fifty-seven per cent of HIV-positive participants reported unprotected sex within the past 90 days, 16.4% with serodiscordant partners. Odds of risky sex were lower among those currently receiving HIV medical care (odds ratio (OR)=0.36), and were greater among females (OR=2.6), those having friends with lower norms of condom use (OR=3.3), and those having a main sexual partner (OR=6.2). Lower odds of receiving HIV medical care were associated with current drug use (OR=0.33), sharing drugs with a sex partner (OR=0.27), and exchanging sex for drugs or money (OR=0.24). Findings suggest the importance of community-based HIV prevention intervention targeting HIV-positive drug users not recovery HIV medical care."
3808,0.001,1.0000,"Where men have had access to successful treatment for HIV (highly active antiretroviral therapy), expectations of both patients and physicians alike have changed significantly over the past decade. Such men, living with HIV, expect to lead fully functional lives including a normal sex life. Sexual dysfunction is well described among men with HIV. We retrospectively analysed details of 190 consecutive men attending a dedicated sexual dysfunction service in our HIV unit over an 18-month period. We took note of the specifics of their HIV disease, illnesses other than HIV, as well as other risk factors associated with sexual dysfunction. Men with sexual dysfunction all commonly reported recreational drug use, hepatitis B and C co-infection, anxiety and depressive illnesses, peripheral neuropathy and lipodystrophy. There was a significant relationship between men complaining of retarded ejaculation and peripheral neuropathy. Sexual dysfunction in non-HIV settings is known to lead to poor adherence to prescribed medications, e.g. antihypertensive agents. Iatrogenic sexual dysfunction in patients may similarly have a potential to lead to poor antiretroviral compliance if not addressed."
1123,0.001,1.0000,"In the last two decades, HIV-1, the retrovirus associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is globally one of the primary causes of morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, existing approaches for interventions are not able to suppress the progression of infection due to this virus. Of the many obstacles, viral entry into the mono-nuclear phagocyte system encompassing monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is a major concern. Viral infection is also responsible for the subsequent distribution of the virus into various tissues throughout the organism. Tremendous progress has been made during the past few years to diagnose and treat patients with HIV/AIDS infection, yet much remains to be done. Recommended treatment involves long-term and multiple drug therapy that causes severe side effects. With almost 12% of the world population suffering from HIV/AIDS, better management of this global threat is highly desired. Nanostructured delivery systems hold promise for improving the situation. Such systems can facilitate the uptake of antiretroviral drugs, causing a considerable improvement in HIV/AIDS therapy. Nanoscale systems have intriguing potential to drastically improve existing HIV/AIDS diagnosis and treatment platforms. Nanosystems constitute a wide range of systems varying from polymeric nanoparticles, to solid-lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, micro- and nanoemulsions, dendrimers, and self-nanoemulsifying systems. Improved bioavailability, solubility, stability, and biocompatibility make them an ideal choice for delivery of antiretroviral drugs. The present review initially describes an updated bird's-eye view account of the literature. Then, we provide a relatively sententious overview on updated patents of recent nanostructured delivery systems for antiretroviral drugs. Finally, we discuss low-cost therapy (such as antioxidants and immune modulators) for the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS. "

Sixty-two percent were former injecting drug users (IDUs). Partners reported not to be HIV infected, IDUs, or men who have sex with men were defined as lower risk. Among 54 HIV-infected NIUs, lower risk partners were reported by 54% of never IDUs and 23% of former IDUs (P=.02). Among 155 HCV-infected NIUs, lower risk partners were reported by 54% of never IDUs and 45% of former IDUs (not significant). Engaging in unprotected vaginal or anal sex and having lower risk partners was reported by 29% of HIV-infected never IDUs, 12% of HIV-infected former IDUs, 29% of HCV-infected never IDUs, and 34% of HCV-infected former IDUs. HIV-infected NIUs, particularly never IDUs, and, possibly, HCV-infected NIUs, are a potential sexual transmission bridge."
4387,0.001,1.0000,"We conducted a retrospective cohort study to estimate the incidence of major blood-borne agents among Italian blood donors and calculated the risk of infection among blood recipients using the 'incidence/window period model'. The study was conducted among 46 180 blood donors enrolled in six blood centres between 1994 and 1999. During follow-up, seven new infections were confirmed: three donors seroconverted for anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); two for anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV); and two showed hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) reactivity; no cases of syphilis were observed. The incidence rates per 100 000 person/years were: 4.06 (95% CI: 0.82-11.85) for HIV; 2.41 (95% CI: 0.29-8.70) for HCV; and 2.70 (95% CI: 0.32-9.77) for HBsAg; the incidence for total hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was 9.77 per 100 000 person/years (95% CI: 1.16-35.36). The estimated risk of an infectious blood unit not being detected was: 2.45 (95% CI: 0.13-12.33) per 1 million units for HIV; 4.35 (95% CI: 0.30-22.39) for HCV; and 15.78 (95% CI: 1.16-84.23) for HBV. Overall, an estimated 22.58 per 1 million units are infected. In Italy, the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections is low and is similar to that in other western countries. The introduction of new more sensitive screening tests could reduce the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted infection by 40-80%."

We describe a retrospective study of 78 HIV-infected patients with NHL treated between 1999 and 2006 at the Infectology Institute, a reference center for HIV treatment in São Paulo, Brazil. All patients were treated with standard CHOP therapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). An evaluation of treatment response was available for 48 (61.5%) of the patients who completed initial treatment. Twenty-three patients (47.9%) achieved a complete response (CR), 3 (6.3%) achieved a partial response, and 22 (45.8%) failed to respond to treatment. Of the 30 patients (38.5%) who were not available for response evaluation, 23 died of sepsis during treatment, 5 abandoned treatment, and 2 are still under treatment. After a median follow-up of 3 years, the overall survival rate for all patients is 20.5%. A univariate analysis showed a significant CR rate in patients with respect to the following factors: no acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnosis prior to the lymphoma, disease stage of I to II, and an International Prognostic Index (IPI) of low or low-intermediate risk. A multivariate analysis indicated that only a previous AIDS diagnosis and the IPI were significantly related to the CR rate. A median disease-free survival (DFS) time for the patients who achieved a CR was not reached, with a mean survival time of 73 months and a 3-year DFS rate of 77.5%.

6167,0.001,1.0000,"From 1985 through 1990, 1100 of 500,000 human blood donations in Syracuse, New York were repeatedly reactive by ELISA for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Nine hundred of the ELISA-reactive samples were confirmed as negative by Western blot (WB), 40 were confirmed as positive, and the remaining 160 sera were indeterminate, reacting mainly with HIV-1 gag gene products. Twenty donors with the most reactive indeterminate WB were selected for follow-up studies. Four of these 20 donors admitted to retroviral risk factors and, interestingly, 12 (60%) had exposure to dairy cattle and drank unpasteurized milk. These 20 donors were analyzed over a 3-year period for the presence of the pathogenic human retroviruses HIV-1, HIV-2, human T cell lymphoma/leukemia virus types I and II (HTLV-I and HTLV-II), as well as bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) and leukemia virus (BLV). Retroviral analyses included serology, plasma antigen capture, virus culture, and the polymerase chain reaction. Only one donor seroconverted and was clearly infected with HIV-1. None of the other 19 donor serological reactivities to HIV-1 changed, nor were they positive for any of the above-mentioned retroviruses. Although we cannot ascertain whether these latter 19 HIV-1 WB-indeterminate donors were exposed to human or bovine retroviral proteins, it is unlikely that their HIV-1 seroreactivity was caused by infection with HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-I, HTLV-II, BLV, or BIV."

The 10 infants born at 37 weeks of gestation or earlier were at higher risk of HIV-1 infection than infants born at 38 weeks of gestation or later (60% vs 22%) but the median age at appearance of disease was approximately 5 months in both groups. The HIV-1 transmission rate was not associated with predelivery levels of maternal T cells, anti-p24, or neutralising antibodies but it was higher, among full-term infants, for those with mothers in the lowest third of the distribution of anti-gp120 levels (53%). On immunoblot, transmitting mothers lacked a gp120 band but not other bands. Protection was not associated with antibody to recombinant peptides from the hypervariable region of the major neutralising gp120 epitope, and the anti-gp120 endpoint dilution titre was similar in transmitting and non-transmitting mothers. Mothers of uninfected full-term infants appear to confer immunological protection against HIV-1 infection of their offspring by way of a high-affinity antibody to a gp120 epitope, whose specificity has importance for vaccine development and possibly perinatal immunotherapy."
7086,0.001,1.0000,"Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common non-AIDS-defining tumor diagnosed in HIV-infected patients. Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) led to a decreased incidence of several malignancies among HIV-infected patients, the incidence of HIV-associated Hodgkin's lymphoma (HIV-HL) has been persistent in recent years. Its unusually aggressive tumor behavior includes a higher frequency of unfavorable histologic subtypes, high stage and extranodal involvement by the time of presentation and poor therapeutic outcome, in comparison with Hodgkin's lymphoma outside the HIV setting. Treatment of HIV-HL is challenging considering the underlying immunodeficiency caused by HIV itself and may increase the risk of opportunistic infections by inducing further immunosuppression. To address this delicate vulnerability of the HIV-infected host, tailored regimens, which are less aggressive than standard regimens for HIV-negative hosts, have been applied to achieve tumor control. The introduction of HAART has opened a new perspective in the treatment of HIV-associated malignancies. The improved control of HIV infection and the subsequently improved survival rates of HIV-infected patients has changed the goal from tumor control to cure and new treatment approaches with more potent regimens need to be evaluated to improve survival and quality of life in HIV-HL."
1538,0.001,1.0000,"Using the highly sensitive Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA has already been detected in many patients negative for all other serological HBV markers [12]. But yet, the relevance of these findings as a marker of infectivity has not been determined. We therefore have used the PCR to examine the perinatal route of HBV transmission by testing sera from 109 mother-child pairs in Yaoundé, Cameroon. HBV-DNA was detected in 25 (23%) of the mother's sera from which only 5 were positive for HBsAg. At the age of 6 months only one baby out of 25 who could be retested had become positive for HBV-DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg. Low serum HBV-DNA levels which are still detectable by the PCR therefore seem not to be associated with a high risk of perinatal HBV transmission."

Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) there has been a notably decrease in patients morbidity and mortality, nevertheless with the prolonged survival, many of these patients are at risk of developing chronic complication, secondary to the infection of hepatotropic viruses. End stage liver disease is one of the main causes of morbid-mortality among HIV patients in developed countries.

9026,0.001,1.0000,"Many HIV-infected women are not realizing the benefits of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) despite significant advancements in treatment. Women in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES) are highly marginalized and struggle with multiple morbidities, unstable housing, addiction, survival sex, and elevated risk of sexual and drug-related harms, including HIV infection. Although recent studies have identified the heightened risk of HIV infection among women engaged in sex work and injection drug use, the uptake of HIV care among this population has received little attention. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the needs of women engaged in survival sex work and to assess utilization and acceptance of HAART. During November 2003, a baseline needs assessment was conducted among 159 women through a low-threshold drop-in centre servicing street-level sex workers in Vancouver. Cross-sectional data were used to describe the sociodemographic characteristics, drug use patterns, HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and status, and attitudes towards HAART. High rates of cocaine injection, heroin injection, and smokeable crack cocaine use reflect the vulnerable and chaotic nature of this population. Although preliminary findings suggest an overall high uptake of health and social services, there was limited attention to HIV care with only 9% of the women on HAART. Self-reported barriers to accessing treatment were largely attributed to misinformation and misconceptions about treatment. Given the acceptability of accessing HAART through community interventions and women specific services, this study highlights the potential to reach this highly marginalized group and provides valuable baseline information on a population that has remained largely outside consistent HIV care."
490,0.001,1.0000,"Genotypic population-based methods could be faster and less expensive than phenotypic recombinant assays for determining human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor usage in patient samples, but their clinical use requires good genotype-phenotype correlation and concordance with clonal analyses. We have assessed these requirements by clonal analysis of the V1 to V3 env PCR products of 26 patients infected with subtype B HIV-1. We used the resulting set of molecular clones, all sequenced and characterized using a single-cycle recombinant virus phenotypic entry assay, to reevaluate genotype-phenotype correlations. Combining the previously described 11/25 and net charge rules for the V3 genotype improved the prediction of HIV-1 coreceptor usage. We also evaluated the concordance of population-based and clonal analyses for predicting the coreceptor usage of HIV-1 quasispecies. Our population-based recombinant phenotypic assay and direct sequencing of V3 were similarly sensitive for detecting the presence of minor species in the virus population, and both correlated well with clonal analysis. The improved genotype-phenotype correlation obtained by combining two simple genotypic rules and the good concordance with clonal analyses suggest that direct sequencing of V3 is a valuable alternative to population-based recombinant phenotypic assays."

All departments of internal medicine and infectious diseases from the GERMIVIC Study Group prospectively recorded all deaths in HIV-infected patients during 2003. Fifty-nine departments, following a total of 20 940 HIV-infected patients, participated in the study. Results were compared with those of previous surveys conducted using similar methodology in 1995, 1997 and 2001. Among 215 deaths observed during 2003, 101 (46.9%) were related to AIDS, 27 (12.6%) to ESLD and 87 (40.5%) to other causes. Mortality because of ESLD represented 23.7% of non-AIDS-related deaths. Patients dying from ESLD had chronic hepatitis because of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 92.6% of cases and moderate (30-60 g) or high (>60 g) alcohol consumption (43.5% and 26.0%, respectively). In this population, deaths because of ESLD were 1.5% in 1995, 6.6% in 1997, 14.3% in 2001 and 12.6% in 2003. The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma as a cause of death remained high in 2003 but stable when compared with 2001 (25%vs 14.8%). Treatment of hepatitis C in patients who died from ESLD was more frequent in 2003 (44.4%) than in 2001 (26.3%). Seven years after the introduction of HAART, ESLD associated with HCV infections is a leading cause of mortality in HIV-infected patients, which did not increase between the years 2001 and 2003."

Nevirapine was rapidly absorbed, but the time to peak plasma concentrations increased with higher doses. Clearance was more rapid in chronic dosing studies than predicted by single-dose studies and was more rapid in younger children than in adolescent children. Rash, which occurred in 1 of the 21 study participants, was the single toxicity regarded as nevirapine-related. At doses > or = 240 mg/m2/day, 5 of 10 children experienced durable suppression of plasma p24 antigen to < 50% of baseline values through 8 weeks of nevirapine monotherapy. Viruses resistant to nevirapine were isolated from all children during therapy, but their isolation did not always predict loss of antiviral activity. The evaluation of nevirapine in combination therapy trials is underway in children."
3762,0.001,1.0000,"Adherence to a fixed dose combination of dual nucleoside antiretroviral therapy was compared between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients newly started on a fixed dosed combination of lamivudine (3TC) 150 mg/zidovudine (ZDV) 300 mg versus its components taken as separate pills. Medicaid pharmacy claims data were used for analyses. To examine the association between treatment group and medication adherence, three types of multivariate regressions were employed. In addition, all regressions were conducted for the whole population using data from 1995 to 2001 as well as a subpopulation, which excluded data prior to September 1997. Model covariates included patient characteristics, healthcare utilization, and non-study antiretroviral therapy use. The likelihood of > or =95% adherence among patients on combination therapy was three times greater than patients taking 3TC and ZDV in separate pills. Also, combination therapy patients had on average 1.4 fewer adherence failures per year of follow-up and nearly double the time to adherence failure compared to the separate pills group. Consistency among study results suggests that fixed dose combination therapies such as lamivudine (3TC) 150 mg/ zidovudine (ZDV) 300 mg should be considered when prescribing HIV treatment that includes an appropriate dual nucleoside."
5278,0.001,1.0000,"We compared the line probe assay (LiPA) to sequence analysis for the detection of mutations conferring resistance to nucleoside inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT). Plasma samples from 40 patients who had received zidovudine, dideoxyinosine, and dideoxycytosine, alone or in combination, and who were enrolled in the ALTIS 2 clinical trial (lamivudine [3TC] plus stavudine) were tested at enrollment and at week 24. RT PCR products from plasma were used for LiPA, and DNA was used for sequence analysis. LiPA gave uninterpretable results for 8.5% of the analyzed codons corresponding to 63 samples, mainly for codons 41, 69, and 70. Several minor discrepancies between the two methods occurred, mainly due to the ability of LiPA to detect mixed populations while sequence analyses detect a single homogeneous population. LiPA is suitable for detecting mixed populations and easy to implement in clinical laboratories and might be useful for epidemiological surveys of primary HIV-1 resistance."
5614,0.001,1.0000,"We investigated the effect of dyslipidemia associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy on cardiovascular risk and life expectancy among patients who had the human immunodeficiency virus. Dyslipidemia estimates were based on results from a phase 2 randomized trial that compared lipid changes after 32 weeks of therapy with atazanavir with those with nelfinavir (each in combination with stavudine and lamivudine). The resultant increased coronary risk was estimated using Framingham risk equations, and change in life expectancy (after adjustment for mortality due to human immunodeficiency virus) was based on the cardiovascular life expectancy model, which is based on a published Markov's model. Levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly more among patients who used nelfinavir (+24% and +28%) than among those who used atazanavir (+4% and +1%). This dyslipidemia increased the risk of coronary disease by 50% over 10 years. The absence of dyslipidemia was estimated to preserve life expectancy 0.15 to 1.53 additional years depending on a patient's age, gender, and other risk factors. There are increasing reports of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular events associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy. Significant increases in blood lipid levels observed with some protease inhibitors are associated with an increase in calculated 10-year coronary risk. Accordingly, minimizing dyslipidemia associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy may preserve life expectancy among adults who have the human immunodeficiency virus."

A 5-year-old boy presented to the pediatric oncology clinic with swelling of the neck and warts on his lower jaw. His blood chemistry and complete blood count were normal, as was chest x-ray. HIV, EBV, CMV, and parvovirus serologies were negative. The patient was investigated for malignancy and lymphoma but no association was found. Histopathologic examination of the lymph node and the lesion revealed DL and verruca vulgaris, respectively. DL represents a benign form of reactive lymph node hyperplasia and described in patients with HIV and EBV infections. It is a rare entity described in patients with human papilloma virus infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of DL in a patient with human papilloma virus infection."
9113,0.001,1.0000,"The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) sees approximately equal to 17,000 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients each year, which makes it the largest provider of HIV care in the United States. HIV causes chronic progressive disease that leads to early death. Newer combination antiretro viral treatments are effective but expensive and difficult to use. The HIV Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (HIV-QUERI) uses the QUERI process to identify high-risk and high-volume populations (step 1), which includes those already under VHA care for HIV, those who do not know of their infection, and those at risk for HIV. In identifying best practices (step 2), the HIV-QUERI will benefit greatly from existing guidelines for the care of established HIV infection, but gaps in knowledge regarding adherence to medication regimens and cost-effective screening are large. To identify existing practice patterns (step 3), the HIV-QUERI will develop a clean analytic data set based on Immunology Case Registry files and expand it through a survey of veterans. Interventions to improve care (step 4) will include national, regional, and site-specific feedback on performance relative to quality standards, as well as patient-level and provider-level interventions to improve adherence and support medical decision-making. To document that best practices improve outcomes and quality of life (steps 5 and 6), HIV-QUERI will track indicators on an ongoing basis by use of the Immunology Case Registry database and possible future waves of the survey. In addition, we will require that these issues be addressed in evaluations of HIV-QUERI interventions. In the present article, we present these steps within a framework and plan."
1378,0.001,1.0000,"We have previously succeeded in infecting normal human hepatocyte primary cultures with hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, infection was subject to individual variations even in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which appeared to increase the amounts of viral DNA associated with the cells. In this study, we have defined conditions which enhance hepatitis B virus penetration into the cells, and we show that, under these conditions, infection of hepatocytes is always possible, regardless of their individual origin. We have found that addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the cultures maintained in the presence of 2% DMSO at the time of infection markedly increased the infection process and made it highly reproducible. Moreover, both the tissue and species specificity were preserved. This increased HBV infection was correlated to increased amount of internalized HBV DNA and to enhanced attachment of the virions. From these results it may be assumed that PEG could favor a better interaction between virions and cells, resulting in an activated internalization of bound viral particles. Data also show that adult human hepatocyte primary cultures, which are not equally susceptible to HBV infection, are consistently capable of viral replication when the viral genome has entered the cells. This suggests that the main limitation of the in vitro HBV infection lies in the ability of human hepatocytes to specifically bind the viral particles."
8904,0.001,1.0000,"Although cardiotoxic effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are a growing concern, there is a lack of prospective studies of subclinical involvement of the heart in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. This study evaluated noninvasively cardiac morphologic characteristics and function in HIV-positive (HIV(+)) men receiving HAART for > or =2 years with no clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography at rest, including tissue Doppler imaging and exercise testing, were performed in 30 HIV(+) men (age 42.1 +/- 4.7 years, duration of HIV infection 10.4 +/- 4.7 years, duration of HAART 5.3 +/- 2.1 years) and 26 age-matched healthy controls. At rest, HIV(+) patients had similar left ventricular (LV) mass indexed to height(2.7) (40.6 +/- 9.5 vs 37.5 +/- 9.3 g/m; p >0.05), but a higher prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction (abnormal relaxation or pseudonormal filling pattern in 64% of patients vs 12% of controls; p <0.001). LV systolic function indexes were significantly lower (ejection fraction 60.4 +/- 8.7% vs 66.9 +/- 6.9%; p <0.01, and tissue Doppler imaging peak systolic velocity 11.4 +/- 1.6 vs 13.5 +/- 2.2 cm/s; p <0.001). Pulmonary artery pressure was higher in patients compared with controls (32.1 +/- 5.4 vs 26.1 +/- 6.5 mm Hg; p <0.001). Exercise testing showed decreased exercise tolerance in HIV(+) patients, with no case of myocardial ischemia. In conclusion, subclinical cardiac abnormalities are frequently observed in HIV(+) patients on HAART. The usefulness of systematic noninvasive screening in this population should be considered.

184,0.001,1.0000,"A total of 328 cases of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Western Australia in 1983-1987 was studied with respect to demographic factors, the risk profile, the clinical progression of disease, the utilization of inpatient services and trends in incidence over time. The crude incidence rates were 8.8 cases/100,000 person-years in men and 0.4 cases/100,000 person-years in women. Age-specific rates peaked at 25 to 29 years of age in men. The risk of HIV infection was associated with metropolitan residence, low socioeconomic level, and two specific occupational groups. Homosexual and bisexual men constituted 86% of all cases; the incidence rate of HIV infection in such men was approximately 1000-times higher than was the incidence rate by apparent sexual transmission in heterosexual persons. However, the proportion of cases that occurred in women or that apparently was caused by heterosexual sexual transmission increased from zero in 1983-1984 to 7.5% and 5.4%, respectively, in 1987. After two years of follow-up, 71% of preclinical (category-C) patients had developed signs, symptoms or evidence of immune dysfunction, and 12% of those patients with lymphadenopathy or with other early clinical features of disease (category-B) had progressed to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). At 21 months of follow-up, the survival rate with AIDS was 9%. Patients with AIDS utilized an average of 68.9 short-stay hospital bed-days per person-year, while category-B patients used 11.5 hospital bed-days per person-year. Notifications of HIV infection increased each year from 1983 to 1986, but fell by 22% in 1987. The latter may have been as a result of chance, a screening artefact or a real reduction in the incidence rate."
103,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been implicated in the generation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated neurological dysfunction, and it is believed that the presence of CD4 in the nervous system may be involved in the susceptibility of selected neural cell populations to HIV-1 infection. We previously demonstrated (B. Wigdahl, R. A. Guyton, and P. S. Sarin, Virology 159:440-445, 1987) that glial cells derived from human fetal dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are susceptible to HIV-1 infection and subsequently express at least a fraction of the virus genome. In contrast to HIV-1 infection of CD4+ lymphocytes, which can be blocked by treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed against the HIV-1-binding region of CD4 (T4A epitope), treatment of human fetal DRG glial cells with similar antibodies resulted in only a slight reduction in HIV-1-specific gag antigen expression. In addition, preincubation of the HIV-1 inoculum prior to infection with HIV-1-neutralizing antiserum did not reduce HIV-1 gag antigen expression in these cells. Furthermore, we were unable to detect the synthesis or accumulation of the CD4 molecule in neural cell populations derived from DRG. However, a protected CD4-specific RNA fragment was detected in RNA isolated from human fetal DRG and spinal cord tissue by an RNase protection assay with a CD4-specific antisense RNA probe. RNA blot hybridization analysis of total cellular RNA isolated from human fetal DRG and spinal cord demonstrated specific hybridization to an RNA species that comigrated with the mature 3.0-kilobase CD4 mRNA as well as two unique CD4 RNA species with relative molecular sizes of approximately 5.3 and 6.7 kilobases. Furthermore, all three CD4-related RNA species were polyadenylated when isolated from human fetal spinal cord tissue. These data suggest that HIV-1 infection of human fetal DRG glial cells may proceed via a mechanism of viral entry independent of the T4A epitope of CD4."
7144,0.001,1.0000,"This article summarizes the current state of antiviral therapy of hepatitis B with special attention given to areas that remain controversial or poorly defined. Strict adherence to liver association practice guidelines may result in missed opportunities to treat patients with significant underlying liver disease. In particular, recommended ALT thresholds may not appropriately reflect disease activity or degree of fibrosis. There is growing evidence that an alternative treatment paradigm for preventing late-stage disease complications may be indicated in highly viremic patients with early life exposure to hepatitis B. Pegylated interferon therapy is often a better choice for young to middle-aged patients with genotype A and B because of the higher rate of HBeAg seroconversion and a greater chance for HBsAg seroconversion in both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients as compared to nucleoside analogs. Nucleoside analog monotherapy is the current standard of care for many patients. However, long-term monotherapy results in resistance to a variable degree and sequential monotherapy may result in multi-drug resistant virus. Which patients would specifically benefit from early combination therapy also remains poorly defined. The rapidity and robustness of the suppression of HBV DNA while on a nucleoside analog should be monitored relatively early during treatment because it affects treatment outcome and the rate of resistance. While great progress has been made in treating hepatitis B, many important issues require further study."
9950,0.001,1.0000,"Risk factors associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are well documented, but the synergisms between these risk factors are not well examined. We conducted a hospital-based, case-control study among 115 HCC patients and 230 non-liver cancer controls. Cases and controls were pathologically diagnosed at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and were matched by 5-year age groups, sex, and year of diagnosis. Information on risk factors was collected by personal interview and medical records review. Blood samples were tested for the presence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus antigen (anti-HCV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Conditional logistic regression was used to determine odds ratios (ORs) by the maximum likelihood method. Multivariate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 15.3 (4.3-54.4), 12.6 (2.5-63.1), 4.5 (1.4-14.8), and 4.3 (1.9-9.9) for anti-HCV, HBsAg, heavy alcohol consumption (>/=80 mL ethanol/d), and diabetes mellitus, respectively. Synergistic interactions on the additive model were observed between heavy alcohol consumption and chronic hepatitis virus infection (OR, 53.9; 95% CI, 7.0-415.7) and diabetes mellitus (OR, 9.9; 95% CI, 2.5-39.3). Independent of the effect of HCV, HBV, and diabetes mellitus, heavy alcohol consumption contributes to the majority of HCC cases (32%), whereas 22%, 16%, and 20% were explained by HCV, HBV, and diabetes mellitus, respectively. In conclusion, the significant synergy between heavy alcohol consumption, hepatitis virus infection, and diabetes mellitus may suggest a common pathway for hepatocarcinogenesis. Exploring the underlying mechanisms for such synergisms may indicate new HCC prevention strategies in high-risk individuals."
8488,0.001,1.0000,"We investigated in-vitro lymphoproliferative responses and T-cell subsets in 38 HIV-1-infected patients showing impaired restoration of CD4 T cells despite prolonged viral suppression (discordant), and in 42 HIV-1-infected patients showing positive immunological and virological responses to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (concordant). In comparison to concordant patients, discordant patients showed poor lymphocyte proliferation, lower secretion of IL-2 and IFN-gamma, a lower percentage of perforin and granzyme-B-producing CD8 T cells, and poor differentiation of effector memory CD8 T(EM) cells into CD8 T(EMRA) cells in in-vitro stimulation assays, especially against HIV-1 Gag p24 and one of its peptide pools. Functional CD8 T-cell responses of discordant patients after stimulation with recall antigens, Candida albicans, and tetanus toxoid, were also inferior to concordant patients, but comparable to normal healthy controls. Examination of the multifunctional roles of T cells is imperative in describing the overall magnitude of immune responses to HIV-1. Our results suggest that prolonged suppression of plasma viremia alone does not warrant good qualitative and quantitative CD8 T-cell responses to HIV-1, implying that CD4 T cells are required for maintenance of protective CD8 T-cell responses."
4355,0.001,1.0000,"We studied barriers to HIV care among HIV-positive Latinos in the US-Mexico border region, where HIV prevalence is increasing. HIV-positive participants receiving HIV care were recruited from clinics in Southern California and underwent structured interviews (n = 157). Logistic regression explored covariates associated with > or =1 barrier to HIV care. HIV-positive patients were mostly male (84.7%), of Mexican-origin (82.8%), and had a mean age of 37.3 years. Among males (n = 133), 67% identified as men who have sex with men. In the prior year, patients received the following care in Mexico: HIV care (33.1%), non-HIV care (43.3%), prescription medications (51.6%), and traditional medications/herbs (17.2%). The most common barriers to HIV care included stigma and medication side effects concerns. Factors independently associated with > or =1 barrier to HIV care were HIV diagnosis >1 year ago; being of Mexican-origin; crossing the US-Mexico border <5 times in the past year; obtaining medications in Mexico; and age. Findings illustrate that bi-national health care utilization is common, which has implications for HIV service delivery in both countries. Additional studies are needed to better understand individual, provider and system level barriers to HIV care in the San Diego/Tijuana border region."
3379,0.001,1.0000,"Antiretroviral treatment nonadherence is complex, implicating more than a patient's ability and motivation to be compliant. The bulk of the research to date focuses on individual level barriers with less emphasis on the many system level factors that potentially impact patients' adherence behaviors. This study examined the effects of system enabling factors in addition to the frequently studied individual predisposing and enabling factors upon nonadherence to treatment. One hundred eighty-two patients from five community-based clinics were interviewed and their medical charts examined. Patients' self-reported nonadherence was correlated with clinicians' assessments of medication and appointment nonadherence. Seven individual predisposing factors (gender, ethnicity, birthplace, years of education, HIV Overview of Problems-Evaluation System [HOPES] psychosocial, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] anxiety, and HADS depression scores) were found to be significantly associated with treatment adherence/nonadherence. Individual enabling factors (hopefulness and access to health care), as well as treatment by clinic staff, a system enabling factor, were significantly associated with adherence/nonadherence. In a multivariate analysis, six factors - age (younger), gender (female), birth outside the United States, level of hopefulness (lower), access to health care (lower), and treatment by clinic staff (poorer) - accounted for 19.3% of the variance in nonadherence. Results of this study indicated that several individual predisposing and enabling factors were potential predictors of treatment nonadherence; however, system enabling factors, e.g., treatment by clinic staff were also associated with treatment nonadherence. Further studies are needed to examine the complex relationships of individual and system related factors in predicting treatment nonadherence."
6020,0.001,1.0000,"Scaling up access to HIV viral load testing for individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy in low-resource settings is a global health priority, as emphasised by research showing the benefits of suppressed viral load for the individual and the whole population. Historically, large-scale diagnostic test implementation has been slow and incomplete because of service delivery and other challenges. Building on lessons from the past, in this Personal View we propose a new framework to accelerate viral load scale-up and ensure equitable access to this essential test. The framework includes the following steps: (1) ensuring adequate financial investment in scaling up this test; (2) achieving pricing agreements and consolidating procurement to lower prices of the test; (3) strengthening functional tiered laboratory networks and systems to expand access to reliable, high-quality testing across countries; (4) strengthening national leadership, with prioritisation of laboratory services; and (5) demand creation and uptake of test results by clinicians, nurses, and patients, which will be vital in ensuring viral load tests are appropriately used to improve the quality of care. The use of dried blood spots to stabilise and ship samples from clinics to laboratories, and the use of point-of-care diagnostic tests, will also be important for ensuring access, especially in settings with reduced laboratory capacity. For countries that have just started to scale up viral load testing, lessons can be learnt from countries such as Botswana, Brazil, South Africa, and Thailand, which have already established viral load programmes. This framework might be useful for guiding the implementation of viral load with the aim of achieving the new global HIV 90-90-90 goals by 2020."
631,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects an estimated 3.5 million persons in the United States (1), making it the most common bloodborne infection in the country. Recent surveillance data showed increased rates of HCV infection among adolescents and adults who are predominantly white, live in nonurban areas, and have a history of injection drug use.* U.S. birth certificate data were used to analyze trends and geographic variations in rates of HCV infection among women giving birth during 2009-2014. Birth certificates from Tennessee were used to examine individual characteristics and outcomes associated with HCV infection, using a multivariable model to calculate adjusted odds of HCV-related diagnosis in pregnancy among women with live births. During 2009-2014, HCV infection present at the time of delivery among pregnant women from states reporting HCV on the birth certificate increased 89%, from 1.8 to 3.4 per 1,000 live births. The highest infection rate in 2014 (22.6 per 1,000 live births) was in West Virginia; the rate in Tennessee was 10.1. In adjusted analyses of Tennessee births, the odds of HCV infection were approximately threefold higher among women residing in rural counties than among those in large urban counties, 4.5-fold higher among women who smoked cigarettes during pregnancy, and nearly 17-fold higher among women with concurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HCV infection among pregnant women is an increasing and potentially modifiable threat to maternal and child health. Clinicians and public health officials should consider individual and population-level opportunities for prevention and risk mitigation."

1101,0.001,1.0000,"Little is known regarding the prevalence and distribution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in U.S. Hispanics/Latinos. We sought to determine the prevalence of HBV exposure (serum HBV core antibody; anti-HBc), active HBV infection (serum HBV surface antigen; HBsAg), and vaccine-induced HBV immunity (antibody against HBV surface antigen; anti-HBs) in U.S. Hispanics/Latinos and consider how these data inform clinical screening recommendations. Our analysis included 11,999 women and men of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), a population-based, household survey in four urban communities (Bronx, NY; Miami, FL; Chicago, IL; and San Diego, CA) of U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized self-identifying Hispanic/Latino adults ages 18-74. Vaccine-induced immunity was defined as detection of anti-HBs, but not anti-HBc. However, if anti-HBc were present, it was considered evidence of exposure to HBV, with detection of HBsAg used to distinguish those with active HBV infection. Mean age was 45.7 years, and 7,153 were women. Vaccine-induced immunity was greatest among those ages 18-29 years (60.2% in women, 54% in men) and decreased with increasing age, regardless of country of birth. The prevalence of active HBV infection was 0.29% (95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.43), but varied by country of birth. Those born in the Dominican Republic had the highest prevalence of HBV exposure (20.3% in women, 29.7% in men) and active HBV infection (0.95%)."
2982,0.001,1.0000,"There is accumulating evidence from clinical trials and cohort studies that highly active antiretroviral combination therapy is effective at halting immunologic and clinical progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Its impact at a population level is less well known because the regimes may be difficult to tolerate and compliance poorer. The authors make use of population data for almost all of the HIV-infected people in Scotland in 1997 who were under clinical care and monitor their response to therapy during the first year when these effective treatments became widely available. More than two thirds of the HIV-positive patients were on some form of antiretroviral therapy during the year. The authors show that all treated groups, even those who were on changing regimes, showed net improvement in immunologic status during the year. For the group of patients on triple or quadruple therapy, there was an average increase of more than 100 CD4 cells/mm(3) over the year, with other treatment groups showing more modest, but significant, increases."
8382,0.001,1.0000,"This study describes and conceptualizes the experiences of stigma in a group of children living with HIV in São Paulo, Brazil, and evaluates the impact of access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) over the social course of AIDS and over the children's experiences of stigma. Through ethnographic research in São Paulo from 1999 to 2001, the life trajectories of 50 children ages 1-15 living with or affected by HIV were studied. Data were collected via participant observation and semi-structured informal interviews and analyzed using social theories on illness experience and social inequality. Our results demonstrate that AIDS-related stigma occurs within complex discrimination processes that change as children reach adolescence. We found that structural violence in the forms of poverty, racism, and inequalities in social status, gender, and age fuels children's experiences of stigma. We also describe how access to HAART changes the lived experience of children, reduces stigma, and brings new challenges in AIDS care such as adolescents' sexuality and treatment adherence. Based on these results, we propose structural violence as the framework to study stigma and argue that interventions to reduce stigma that solely target the perception and attitudes toward people living with HIV are limited. In contrast universal access to HAART in Brazil is a powerful intervention that reduces stigma, in that it transforms AIDS from a debilitating and fatal disease to a chronic and manageable one, belongs to a broader mechanism to assure citizens' rights, and reduces social inequalities in access to health care."
8574,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus infection affects approximately 10% of HIV-infected patients. There are an estimated 4 million patients with HIV/HBV coinfection. HIV infection has a deleterious effect on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B and increases the risk of progression to cirrhosis and terminal liver disease. Since the widespread use of highly active antiviral therapy (HAART), liver disease has emerged as one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive patients. Therefore, all patients with HIV/HBV coinfection should be evaluated for treatment of hepatitis B, independently of the CD4 lymphocyte count. Six drugs are currently authorized for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B: standard interferon-alpha (2a and 2b), pegylated interferon alpha-2a, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and telbivudine. Other drugs with activity against HBV, such as tenofovir and emtricitabine, are used for the treatment of HIV infection. In patients not requiring HAART, treatment of hepatitis B should preferably consist of drugs without activity against HIV, such as pegylated interferon or adefovir. In contrast, in patients requiring HAART, a combination of drugs with activity against both viruses should be used, such as lamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir, with the aim of achieving maximal viral suppression and avoiding the development of resistance. Patients with HIV/HBV coinfection require periodic clinical and virological monitoring. Patients with cirrhosis should undergo ultrasonography and alphafetoprotein determination every 6 months for the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma."
9987,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) successfully escapes from host immune surveillance, vaccines and antiretroviral agents. The available antiretroviral compounds can only control viremia, but it is impossible to eliminate the virus from the organism, namely because HIV-1 provirus persists in the reservoir cells from which the virus repeatedly disseminates into new cells. Current therapeutic approaches, however, do not specifically address the stage of virus reactivation. Heme has been demonstrated as very efficient in inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcription, while its derivative hemin ameliorated HIV-1 infection via induction of heme oxygenase-1. Normosang (heme arginate; HA) is a human hemin-containing compound used to treat acute porphyria. In this work, we studied the effects of HA in HIV-1-acutely infected T-cell lines, and in cell lines harboring either a complete HIV-1 provirus (ACH-2 cells) or an HIV-1 ""mini-virus"" (Jurkat clones expressing EGFP under control of HIV LTR). We demonstrate that HA inhibited HIV-1 replication during the acute infection, which was accompanied by the inhibition of reverse transcription. On the other hand, HA alone stimulated the reactivation of HIV-1 ""mini-virus"" and synergized with phorbol ester or TNF-α in the reactivation of HIV-1 provirus. The stimulatory effects of HA were inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine, suggesting an increased redox stress and activation of NF-κB. Further, HA induced expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in ACH-2 cells, while HO-1 was found expressed in untreated Jurkat clones. Inhibitor of HO-1 activity, tin protoporphyrin IX, further increased HA-mediated reactivation of HIV-1 ""mini-virus"" in Jurkat clones, and this effect was also inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine. The stimulatory effects of HA on HIV-1 reactivation thus seem to involve HO-1 and generation of free radicals. Additionally, the effective concentrations of HA did neither affect normal T-cell activation with PMA nor induce activation of the unstimulated cells. In conclusion, HA appears to possess a combination of unique properties that could help to decrease the pool of latently infected reservoir cells, while simultaneously inhibiting HIV-1 replication in newly infected cells. Our results thus suggest a new direction to explore in treatment of HIV/AIDS disease."
4427,0.001,1.0000,"In recent years, it has become apparent that the lung is an important niche for the proliferation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which may have implications for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The lung itself is a major site for the opportunistic infections associated with the progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), specifically Pneumocystis carinii, Myobacterium tuberculosis and pyogenic bacteria. These cases of active pulmonary complications are direct indicators of enhanced progression to AIDS-defining illness and increased morbidity and mortality. It is therefore essential that the interaction between the lung and HIV is fully understood. Recent research indicates the lung may be a major sanctuary for the virus, with distinct evolution and replication in contrast to other target organs for HIV. In this review, we will discuss the recent findings of HIV infection, evolution, host factors involved in the control of HIV within the lung and the impact this may have on current therapy."

A 41-year-old man infected with HIV-1 who had lymphoma was treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Before transplantation he received high-dose zidovudine for 2 weeks (5 mg/kg body weight intravenously every 4 hours) and after transplantation he received a lower maintenance dose (1.33 mg/kg body weight intravenously every 4 hours). No untoward toxicities attributable to zidovudine were observed. Bone marrow engraftment occurred on day 17. Chromosome and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses demonstrated complete chimerism. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow samples were negative for HIV-1 by culture and polymerase chain reaction gene amplification 32 days after transplantation. The patient died 47 days after transplantation because of tumor relapse. Analysis of autopsy tissue showed no evidence of HIV-1 by either culture (brain, bone marrow, lymph node, and tumor specimens) or by polymerase chain reaction gene amplification for HIV-1 RNA and DNA sequences (brain, bone marrow, heart, kidney, liver, lung, rectosigmoid, spleen, and tumor specimens). Immunologic monitoring showed loss of HIV-1 antibody. Adoptive immunologic transfer was shown to be present to both tetanus and diphtheria antigens. Our case suggests that the HIV-1-infected recipient cells may have been eradicated secondary to the bone marrow ablative chemo-radiotherapy and that zidovudine may be able to prevent the establishment of HIV-1 infection in donor hematopoietic-lymphoid cells."
762,0.001,1.0000,"Eleven (50%) of 22 HIV-seropositive patients suffering from congenital coagulation defects and followed at the Hemophilia Center of Padua met the eligibility criteria for zidovudine (AZT) therapy. A 3-year clinical and laboratory follow up is described. Mean length of AZT treatment was 14.3 +/- 11 months. Three patients were enrolled at the latest stages (CDC stage IV) of HIV disease. They showed no clinical improvement after AZT administration and died with AIDS. One CDC stage III patient died from a high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) which suddenly developed 3 months after starting AZT. Seven patients began antiretroviral treatment when they were mild or asymptomatic for HIV infection (CDC stage II and III). None developed any sign of HIV disease progression on the basis of CDC criteria. Moreover, AZT administration induced an improvement of the humoral markers related to HIV disease, as CD4 T-lymphocyte count, serum beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) and, although only for few months, neopterin (Np) levels. A mild thrombocytopenia due to HIV infection was detected in 5 patients. In all cases AZT treatment was effective in increasing and/or normalizing the platelet count. Reduced daily dose AZT (600-500 mg/day) appeared to be well tolerated and of minimal toxicity as compared to the higher dose (1200 mg/day). In our study, the zidovudine-induced bone marrow suppression, namely severe anemia or pancytopenia, was the major side-effect limiting tolerance of the higher dose AZT."
2185,0.001,1.0000,"Exportin 4 (XPO4) is a novel identified candidate tumour-suppressor gene involved in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was aimed to determine the clinical features of XPO4 mRNA expression and promoter methylation status in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. PBMCs were isolated from 44 HCC, 38 liver cirrhosis (LC), 34 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 17 healthy controls (HCs). The mRNA level and promoter methylation status of XPO4 were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and methylation-specific PCR, respectively. XPO4 mRNA level of HCC patients was significantly lower compared with LC and CHB patients as well as HCs (all P < 0.01, respectively), and significant differences of the XPO4 mRNA level were found in LC and CHB group than in HCs (LC vs HCs, P < 0.01; CHB vs HCs, P < 0.05). Methylation rate of XPO4 promoter was significantly increased in patients with HCC than in patients with CHB and HCs (both P < 0.05). DNA methylation pattern was responsible for the suppression of XPO4 transcription in the progression of HBV infection (P = 0.000). Furthermore, AFP level was significantly higher in HCC patients with XPO4 methylation than in those without methylation ((8702 ± 15635) μm vs (1052 ± 5370) μm, P < 0.05). In conclusion, transcription of XPO4 gene was gradually decreased and methylation rate of XPO4 promoter was increased with the progression of HBV infection. Methylation status of XPO4 in PBMCs tended to be a noninvasive biomarker to predict HCC and the progression of HBV infection. "

Induced sputum and PCR were obtained at each outpatient visit or when any respiratory symptoms were present during a one-year period. All patients with a CD4+ count of less than 200 x 10(6)/l were given prophylactics against P. carinii pneumonia (PCP). PCR was conducted 111 times in 29 patients. M. tuberculosis DNA was detected in 1 patient and CMV DNA in 4 patients. P. carinii DNA was not detected. PCR on induced sputum samples is sensitive for the rapid detection of the initial stage of respiratory events. PCP prophylaxis changes the clinical manifestations of HIV infection."
5569,0.001,1.0000,"A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, which amplifies a fragment of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene present in all mycobacterial species, was developed and tested on 84 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from 51 patients with human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection. The PCR products were characterized either by sequencing or by hybridization with nonradioactive oligonucleotide probes specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, M. avium, or M. genavense. Sequencing was successful for 26 samples compared with the 45 samples for probe hybridization. The sensitivity of DNA amplification compared with microscopic examination was 79.5%. A mixed infection was detected with M. genavense for only one patient who was infected with M. tuberculosis complex. In the group of 22 control patients, where no diagnosis of mycobacterial infection was made during life and no acid-fast bacteria were seen during the autopsy, four samples of one patient were positive by hybridization with the M. tuberculosis probe. This patient had a clinical history compatible with tuberculosis. This PCR method may be a powerful tool for the precise diagnosis of mycobacterial infections from histopathologic material, provided that several sections from the same specimen block are tested."
1710,0.001,1.0000,"The clinical and laboratory features of six human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with atypical mycobacterial skeletal infections, seen at a county outpatient HIV facility or university outpatient clinic, are reviewed and compared with other reported cases. Atypical mycobacterial skeletal infections are a manifestation of advanced HIV disease, with most cases having CD4 counts < 100/mm3 at the time these infections become clinically apparent. Multiple sites are frequently involved, and concomitant skin infection with the same organism is common, especially with Mycobacterium haemophilum. The incidence of atypical mycobacterial skeletal infection in HIV-infected individuals was significantly higher than in the general county hospital district patient population, whereas the frequency of Myobacterium tuberculosis skeletal infection did not differ significantly between the two populations. The clinician therefore should maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical mycobacteria in a patient presenting with skeletal infection in the setting of a markedly depressed CD4 count."
4527,0.001,1.0000,"We evaluated the presenting characteristics, response to therapy, and outcome for 46 patients infected with Mycobacterium kansasii and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). M. kansasii infection occurred late in HIV disease (mean CD4 lymphocyte count, 52.4/mm3), when most patients had already developed AIDS; 91.3% of the patients had pulmonary involvement, and 21.7% had disseminated disease. Clinical and radiographic findings were consistent with pulmonary disease and had been present for approximately 4 weeks. Fourteen of the treated patients had disease that resolved or abated (mean survival +/- SE, 73.7 weeks +/- 14.6 weeks), and 13 had disease that persisted unchanged or worsened (mean survival +/- SE, 57.3 +/- 15.8 weeks). The outcome was poor for 17 patients who did not receive effective therapy (mean survival +/- SE, 14.1 +/- 5.3 weeks). M. kansasii infection presents late in the course of HIV disease, and the lung is the organ most frequently involved. Survival is clearly influenced by therapy, and even patients who respond poorly to therapy survive longer than those who are not treated."
4140,0.001,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which has been provided since 1995 to patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has produced noticeable results in regard to preventing opportunistic infections in this population. Nevertheless, it is still useful to administer specific prophylactic treatment against opportunistic infections in patients treated with HAART and also in patients who do not respond to HAART or who cannot or do not wish to take that treatment. Prophylactic treatment can be halted when, due to HAART, there is a sustained increase in the CD4+ T-lymphocytes count (that count indicates the degree of susceptibility that a person has to opportunistic infections). Guidelines for preventing opportunistic infections were developed in 1995 by the United States Public Health Service and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and they have been reviewed periodically. The last review, done in 1999, marked the introduction of important changes regarding clinical parameters to halt primary and secondary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Toxoplasma gondii, and Mycobacterium avium complex. These changes, along with the latest information concerning the transmission of human herpesviruses, immunization of children infected with HIV or exposed to the virus, and certain drug interactions, are the major focus of this review."
5458,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and aetiology of fever of unknown origin (FUO) in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), to assess the value of the tests used in its diagnosis, and to evaluate possible models of diagnosis for the causes found most frequently. One hundred twenty-eight (3.5%) of 3603 hospitalised HIV-positive patients evaluated from October 1992 to December 1993 had FUO, defined by established criteria. Eighty-six percent of patients with FUO had previously progressed to AIDS. The median CD4+ cell count was 46/mm3. A definite diagnosis was made in 96 (75%) of the 128 patients and a possible diagnosis in 24 (18.7%). whilst no diagnosis was made in eight cases (6.2%). Tuberculosis (48.3%), visceral leishmaniasis (16%), and infection by Mycobacterium avium complex (6.9%) were the diseases found most frequently. The most useful diagnostic tests were liver biopsy (68.9%) and bone marrow aspirate/biopsy (39.7%). It is not possible to predict clinically the cases of FUO due to tuberculosis, whilst thrombocytopaenia < 100,000 cells/mm3 alone is useful for differentiating the cases of visceral leishmaniasis, with a negative predictive value of 95.2%."
8275,0.001,1.0000,"Using lookback procedures and other methods, we identified and then prospectively followed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected transfusion recipients and their sex partners to determine AIDS incidence and risks of heterosexual transmission of HIV-1. At enrollment, 7 of 32 (21.9%) female partners of male recipients were themselves infected with HIV-1, as compared with none of 14 male partners of female recipients (p = 0.08). No additional episodes of transmission were observed. The prevalence of advanced immunodeficiency at enrollment was similar in male and female recipients. Male recipients with advanced immunodeficiency (CD4+ lymphocyte count < or = 0.20 x 10(9)/L or a history of clinical AIDS) at enrollment were more likely to have infected their female partners (odds ratio = 7.9; p = 0.03) than men with neither condition. Similarly, AIDS-free survival, as estimated by the product-limit method, was lower among male transmitters than among male nontransmitters (p = 0.01). Transmission was not associated with frequency of unprotected vaginal intercourse. Our data suggest that HIV-1-infected men who develop immunodeficiency rapidly are more likely to infect their sex partners and that the greater efficiency of male-to-female HIV-1 transmission is not explained by a greater number of sexual contacts or more advanced immunodeficiency in index subjects."
1272,0.001,1.0000,"In order to analyse temporal trends in vertical transmission rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and determinant of congenital HIV infection in Italy, we have considered data from a network of hospitals co-operating in the Italian Collaborative Study on HIV infection in pregnancy, conducted between 1988 and 1995. A total of 1040 women entered the study. The HIV-1 status of the babies was known in 848 cases (81.5%). Transmission rates were highest in the period 1988-1991, then tended to decrease and in 1995 the rate was 9.7 per 100 children (this finding, however, was based on only six infected children and the trend was not statistically significant). Considering the overall series, the risk of vertical HIV transmission was higher in women with low CD4 count in pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) < 400 versus > or = 400 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.9]. In comparison with vaginal delivery the risk of transmission was 0.3 (95% CI 0.1-0.5) and 0.6 (95% CI 0.3-1.2) respectively for elective and emergency delivery. In comparison with women who delivered at term (> or = 37 gestation weeks) the OR of HIV infection of the babies for the whole series was 2.2 (95% CI 1.3-3.6) in women who delivered preterm. Similar findings emerged when the analysis was conducted considering, separately, subjects observed in the period 1988-1991 and 1992-1995. The frequency of Caesarean section increased from 26.5% of deliveries in 1988-1991 to 36.2% in 1992-1995. Consequently, most temporal differences disappeared after standardization for mode of delivery, but the rate in 1995 was still lower than in 1988-1994."
7502,0.001,1.0000,"Ibalizumab (formerly TNX-355) is a first-in-class, monoclonal antibody inhibitor of CD4-mediated human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) entry. Multiple clinical trials with HIV-infected patients have demonstrated the antiviral activity, safety, and tolerability of ibalizumab treatment. A 9-week phase Ib study adding ibalizumab monotherapy to failing drug regimens led to transient reductions in HIV viral loads and the evolution of HIV-1 variants with reduced susceptibility to ibalizumab. This report characterizes these variants by comparing the phenotypic susceptibilities and envelope (env) sequences of (i) paired baseline and on-treatment virus populations, (ii) individual env clones from selected paired samples, and (iii) env clones containing site-directed mutations. Viruses with reduced susceptibility to ibalizumab were found to exhibit reduced susceptibility to the anti-CD4 antibody RPA-T4. Conversely, susceptibility to soluble CD4, which targets the HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein, was enhanced. No changes in susceptibility to the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide or the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc were observed. Functionally, viruses with reduced ibalizumab susceptibility also displayed high levels of infectivity relative to those of paired baseline viruses. Individual env clones exhibiting reduced ibalizumab susceptibility contained multiple amino acid changes in different regions relative to the paired baseline clones. In particular, clones with reduced susceptibility to ibalizumab contained fewer potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs) in variable region 5 (V5) than did paired ibalizumab-susceptible clones. The reduction in ibalizumab susceptibility due to the loss of V5 PNGSs was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Taken together, these findings provide important insights into resistance to this new class of antiretroviral drug."
7270,0.001,1.0000,"We investigated the incidence, clinical and immunological characteristics of human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) infection in a group of multi-transfused patients with thalassaemia major who were exposed to transfusion-associated HIV infection. Seropositivity to HIV by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis was detected in 26 out of 590 patients. At a follow up 21-40 months later, none of these seropositive patients had developed acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and six manifested the AIDS related complex (ARC). ARC was unusually mild and consisted of moderate laterocervical and submandibular lymph node enlargement associated with hypergammaglobulinaemia and a reduced CD4/CD8 ratio resulting from the decreased number of CD4 lymphocytes. These findings suggest that multi-transfused patients with thalassaemia major are relatively resistant to the development of severe manifestations of HIV infection, presumably because their immune status is relatively better preserved than that of other infected populations. Longer follow up is, however, necessary to determine whether the incidence of AIDS will be lower in this population or whether overt AIDS merely takes longer to develop."
1611,0.001,1.0000,"The human intestinal tract harbors a complex microbiotic environment containing commensal bacteria and immunocompetent mucosal cells. There is considerable communication between the bacteria and host cells through dietary constituents and metabolic cycles. We propose that in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) triggers a change in a coupled transorganism (human-bacteria) nitric oxide interchange cycle, that may influence the biosynthesis and recycling of nitric oxide (NO) in AIDS patients. Normally, nitric oxide (NO) is produced from arginine through nitrate NO(3)(-), which is ultimately eliminated in the urine and feces. In HIV infection, however, the NO(3)(-) is converted into NO and nitrite NO(2)(-) and recirculated in the body, perhaps as a result of concomitant opportunistic bacterial infections and cellular hypoxia. Due to the efficient coupling of the human-bacteria nitric oxide cycles, persistently high levels of nitrite and the free radicals peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) may occur in AIDS patients, contributing to the etiology of AIDS-related dementia, persistent immunosuppression and Kaposi's sarcoma."
5081,0.001,1.0000,"Individuals with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) present a variety of pathologic alterations that influence their nutritional status during various stages of the disease. Previous studies have reported a reduction in plasma vitamin E levels in these patients associated with a higher production of free radicals. Individuals with infection, fever, or acute diarrhea excrete considerable amounts of vitamin A in urine. This observation raised the hypothesis that this may also be the case for vitamin E and that its urinary excretion may play a significant role in the reduction of plasma vitamin E levels. In the present investigation, 28 serologically positive HIV-1 (HIV group) divided into a group of 16 patients with AIDS (< 200/mm3 CD4+ T lymphocytes) were studied. The control group consisted of 11 healthy individuals. Urinary and plasma vitamin E levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Patients with AIDS presented reduced plasma vitamin E levels (15.25 +/- 12.19 mumol/L) compared with the HIV (26.40 +/- 17.01 mumol/L) and control (40.03 +/- 31.80 mumol/L) groups. On the other hand, urinary excretion was higher in the AIDS group (0.86 +/- 0.99 mumol/24 h) than in the HIV group (0.62 +/- 0.46 mumol/24 h) and considerably higher than in the control group (0.05 +/- 0.13 mumol/24 h). These results indicate elevated vitamin E excretion in the urine of both patients with AIDS and patients with HIV-1, levels is recommended for patients with HIV and patients with AIDS and, if necessary, the combination of existing medical therapy with vitamin supplementation to maintain the nutritional status related to vitamin E."

8389,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) establishes latent infection in CD4 lymphocytes and macrophages. It can destroy CD4 cells by direct virus cytotoxicity, indirectly through the host response against HIV-infected cells, or by both means. Cells of the macrophage lineage are generally not destroyed but can serve as a reservoir of virus. HIV also causes functional impairment in remaining infected and uninfected cells. After exposure to infection by sexual, blood or maternofetal contact, about half the contacts become infected with HIV. Factors influencing the inoculum derived from the infected person include type of contact, phase of infection and local factors enhancing HIV replication or excretion. In the exposed person, genetic factors and systemic or local events such as infection or inflammatory injury may influence relative susceptibility. After infection with HIV, a number of outcomes may be seen, including symptomless carriage, with or without lymphadenopathy, or symptomatic disease, including the AIDS-related complex, acquired immune deficiency syndrome and HIV encephalopathy. Infection, multiple pregnancy and infancy are associated with increased or more rapid progression to symptomatic disease; malnutrition and immunosuppressive drugs may exert a similar effect. Genetic factors appear to affect disease susceptibility. Mechanisms influencing progression can be divided into those affecting the rate of HIV replication, those that determine the host response to HIV, and those mediated by other immunosuppressive influences. The host's balance with HIV thus resembles that of a tightrope walker, any force tending to tip him towards a catastrophic and irretrievable decline."

Depressive symptoms are commonly associated with the diagnosis of AIDS. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is needed for optimal treatment; however, African-American women who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and who experience depressive symptoms have low and/or inconsistent use of HAART. Additionally, behaviors associated with untreated depressive symptoms increase the chances for HIV transmission. Clinicians, therefore, need to recognize both the individual and the contextual factors that influence those seeking treatment for depressive symptoms. The purpose of this article is to gain a better understanding of the factors that shape treatment seeking for depressive symptoms among HIV-positive African-American women, an important variable in secondary HIV prevention. Multi-contextual underpinnings shape this phenomenon; therefore, Bronfenbrenner's ecological framework was used to organize this literature review. Knowledge gained from this paper can support the promotion of health and can prevent or manage depressive symptoms among this vulnerable group."

In particular, attention has been focused on a nephropathy characterized clinically by nephrotic proteinuria and rapidly advancing renal insufficiency, and histologically by focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). To evaluate the relationship between HIV infection and structural renal disease, we reviewed all consultations between January 1982 and March 1988 to the Division of Nephrology at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), a municipal hospital treating approximately one-third of AIDS cases in San Francisco. Seventy-three consultation requests were received during this period regarding patients with AIDS (48), AIDS-Related Complex (23), or asymptomatic HIV infection (2). Of these, 27 gave evidence of structural renal disease (Group I): 14 had chronic renal insufficiency, in 10 of whom nephrotic proteinuria was also present. However, progression of renal insufficiency to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in this group did not follow the rapid course described for HIV-associated nephropathy. Renal tissue was examined in 11 Group I patients and showed FSGS in four and a variety of acute and chronic glomerular and tubulointerstitial changes in the others. In 46 Group II patients, consultation was requested for acute renal failure or fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base disturbances. We also reviewed 91 consecutive autopsies performed in patients dying with AIDS at SFGH between 1981 and 1986.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8750,0.001,1.0000,"Organ transplantation is an acceptable option for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with end-stage kidney or liver disease. With worse outcomes on the waitlist, HIV-infected patients may actually be disproportionately affected by the organ shortage in the United States. One potential solution is the use of HIV-infected deceased donors (HIVDD), recently legalized by the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act. This is the first analysis of patient-specific data from potential HIVDD, retrospectively examining charts of HIV-infected patients dying in care at six HIV clinics in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2014. Our data suggest that there are four to five potential HIVDD dying in Philadelphia annually who might yield two to three kidneys and three to five livers for transplant. Extrapolated nationally, this would approximate 356 potential HIVDD yielding 192 kidneys and 247 livers annually. However, several donor risk indices raise concerns about the quality of kidneys that could be recovered from HIVDD as a result of older donor age and comorbidities. On the other hand, livers from these potential HIVDD are of similar quality to HIV-negative donors dying locally, although there is a high prevalence of positive hepatitis C antibody. "

We evaluated a new prototype immunochromatographic strip test and 5 commercially available serodiagnostic TB tests in a prospective study comprised of 465 consecutively enrolled patients with suspected TB from 2 hospitals in Botswana. Consenting adults underwent HIV testing, >/=2 sputum smears and cultures, and mycobacterial blood culture. Patients were defined as having TB on the basis of any positive smear or culture. Between January and September 2002, 465 of 498 consecutive patients consented to enrollment. A total of 384 patients (83%) were infected with HIV, and 175 (38%) had TB; the mycobacterial blood culture was the sole source of diagnosis for 26 patients (15%) with TB. Among the tests evaluated, the sensitivity was 0%-63%, the specificity was 39%-99%, the positive predictive value was 0%-39%, and the negative predictive value was 63%-65%. We conclude that the serodiagnostic tests evaluated in this study lacked sufficient sensitivity as sole tests for TB in this population."

This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a Hospital for Tropical Diseases in the state of Goiás, Midwestern Brazil. Patients' medical records were reviewed between January 2008 and December 2009. Sixty-one cases of TB/HIV coinfection were evaluated, and 54 HIV-seronegative TB cases were selected as controls. The prevalence of TB HIV coinfected patients in 2008/2009 was 23%. Coinfection was more prevalent in men (75.4%), with a mean age of 37.1 years. Pulmonary disease (50.8%) was the most frequent clinical form of TB in coinfected patients, followed by disseminated disease (32.8%). Anaemia, malnutrition and low levels of CD4 T lymphocytes were found in about 80% of coinfected patients. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were the most common radiographic finding in coinfected patients (51.8%), and pulmonary cavitation was the rarest event (5.4%). The mortality rate was 2.8 times higher in the TB HIV coinfected group (39.3%) than in TB patients without HIV (18.5%).

Participants (N = 95) were African American/Black and Latino adults with CD4 < 500 cells/mm(3) not taking ART, randomized 1:1 to intervention or control arms, the latter receiving treatment as usual. Primary endpoints were adherence, evaluated via ART concentrations in hair samples, and HIV viral load suppression. The intervention was feasible and acceptable. Eight months post-baseline, intervention participants tended to be more likely to evidence ""good"" (that is, 7 days/week) adherence (60 vs. 26.7 %; p = 0.087; OR = 3.95), and had lower viral load levels than controls (t(22) = 2.29, p = 0.032; OR = 5.20), both large effect sizes.

In addition, we sought to define the adverse events associated with these treatments, with a special focus on central nervous system disorders in the efavirenz treatment group. This prospective, randomized, two-arm, controlled study included 100 patients for whom initial treatment with a protease inhibitor-containing regimen failed. Patients were randomized to start treatment with two nucleoside retrotranscriptase inhibitors plus efavirenz (group 1; 51 patients) or two nucleoside retrotranscriptase inhibitors plus one or more new protease inhibitors (group 2; 49 patients). Quality of life was assessed by a five-point item adapted from the HIV questionnaire of the Medical Outcomes Study, emotional status was evaluated by the Profile of Mood State questionnaire, and patients self-reported adherence. Data were analyzed by both an as-treated method and an intention-to-treat-last observation carried forward method. Patients in group 1 reported the following findings at week 4: dizziness (66%), abnormal dreaming (48%), light-headedness (37%), and difficulty sleeping (35%). At week 24, dizziness (13%; p <.001), abnormal dreaming (18%; p =.002), light-headedness (13%; p =.01), difficulty sleeping (7%; p =.001), and nervousness (13%; p =.01) decreased in these patients. Irritability, abnormal dreaming, and nervousness persisted at week 48 in 13%, 10%, and 8% of group 1 patients, respectively.

Both groups maintained high levels of medication adherence, and no significant differences in the number of patients who had viral loads of <200 copies/mL at week 48 were found (78% of group 1 patients vs. 85% of group 2 patients; p = not significant). At week 48, the mean CD4 cell count +/- SD was 497 +/- 224/mm3 in group 1 and 539 +/- 298/mm3 in group 2 (p = not significant). Despite similar immunologic and virologic outcomes, a second-line efavirenz-containing regimen improved quality of life of HIV-1-infected patients compared with a second-line protease inhibitor-containing regimen. However, close follow-up of patients receiving treatment with efavirenz-based regimens is recommended, especially for those with previous emotional disturbances due to central nervous system disorders in the short term and those with persistence of a low percentage of these disorders in the long term."
2568,0.001,1.0000,"Background Portugal has the highest prevalence rate of HIV infection in Western Europe. The proportion of patients with a late diagnosis, carried out in full-blown AIDS stage, remains high. Skin and mucous membrane manifestations are not rare in these patients. Objective A demographic, clinical, and laboratorial characterization of patients with de novo HIV infection diagnosis made in the Department of Dermatology and Venereology of a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of adult patients newly diagnosed with HIV infection (reactive immunoassay for antibodies to HIV-1/HIV-2 or HIV p24 antigen) in the Dermatology and Venereology Department of a Portuguese central hospital in the period between January 2005 and December 2013. Results During the study period, 97 new cases were diagnosed, 70 men and 27 women. The median age at diagnosis was 36 years. Of the total, 50 cases were diagnosed with a concomitant sexually transmitted infection (STI), more frequently syphilis and ano-genital HPV infection. The remaining 47 patients were diagnosed with other dermatological conditions such as prurigo nodularis, psoriasis, and Kaposi's sarcoma. The duration of complaints that lead to medical attention ranged from <1 week to 8 years, being significantly lower in patients diagnosed with a concomitant STI ( p < 0.01). Basal viral load was also lower in this group of patients ( p < 0.05). Of all the new diagnosed cases, 80% of patients are currently retained in care. Conclusion This study grants a descriptive overview of de novo HIV infection diagnoses performed by dermatovenereologists in a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. As in the past, the importance of Dermato-Venereology for HIV infection diagnosis remains present in daily clinical practice."
6503,0.001,1.0000,"Since the middle of 1987, fewer consistently defined AIDS cases have been reported than expected among homosexual and bisexual men in the United States. This ""AIDS deficit"" was greater among homosexual and bisexual men in New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, but was also striking among all homosexual and bisexual men in the United States. Deficits were virtually absent among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in the United States. Three independent sources of data--placebo-controlled trials, pharmaceutical company reports, and the San Francisco Men's Health Study--were used to demonstrate that the amounts of zidovudine (AZT) given prophylactically to those at highest risk of AIDS since March 1987 have been sufficient to account for most of the observed AIDS deficits. Other advances in the medical care of pre-AIDS patients may have combined with AZT to produce the deficits. Other hypothesized explanations were examined and found insufficient to account for the observed AIDS deficits, including: (a) a sudden halt in new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections during the early or mid-1980s; (b) misspecification of the distribution of AIDS incubation times following HIV infection; (c) increasing delays in the reporting of AIDS cases; (d) changes in the surveillance definition of AIDS in 1987; and (e) evolution of attenuated HIV strains. The hypothesis that therapy is affecting national AIDS rates has important implications. Failure to take the effects of therapy into account can lead to serious underestimates by back-calculation of the cumulative numbers infected with HIV and of AIDS incidence over the longer term. Moreover, it appears that AIDS incidence could be retarded in underserved groups, such as IVDUs, by making AZT and other state-of-the-art treatments readily available to AIDS-free patients with advanced immunodeficiency."
8256,0.001,1.0000,"Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a rheumatic disorder with clinical similarities to HIV-1 infection, and with characteristic autoimmune anti-RNP antibodies specific for the U1 snRNP splicing complex. Anti-RNP antibodies cross-react with the HIV-1 surface, owing to multiple homologies between the gp120/41 envelope complex and the 70K protein of U1 snRNP. A key epitope of 70K, its RNA-binding site, is homologous to a dominant B and T cell epitope in the third variable loop (V3) of gp120. In this study, we tested the ability of anti-RNP sera to inhibit HIV-1 infectivity in vitro. Of nine sera tested, five were 70-99% effective in neutralizing one or more HIV-1 strains. One serum was > 99% effective in neutralizing HIV-1MN, and 86 and 77% effective against the primary isolates HIV-1(CO) and HIV-1(JR-FL), respectively, an efficacy equal to that of a pool of broadly neutralizing antibodies from HIV-1-infected subjects (HIVIG). The mean neutralizing titer of anti-RNP sera against HIV-1(JR-FL) was 3.9-fold higher than that of HIVIG. Neutralizing potency was associated with high reactivity to gp120 by ELISA, and with the presence of serum rheumatoid factor, known to enhance antibody neutralization of other viruses. The current findings provide further evidence that individuals unexposed to HIV-1 may develop immunologic resistance by alternative mechanisms, possibly including molecular mimicry, or exposure to as yet unidentified retroviruses. Thus MCTD, which involves both B and T cell reactivity to self-epitopes homologous to HIV-1, may elucidate new strategies for generating protective immunity to this virus."
6275,0.001,1.0000,"The fear of malevolent use of variola virus by terrorists has led to the implementation of a health care worker vaccination program and to the consideration of vaccination for the general public. However, due to concerns about side effects of the classical smallpox vaccine, especially for immunocompromised individuals, a safer vaccine is urgently needed. We characterized the immunogenicity of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), one of the more promising alternative smallpox vaccines, in a cohort of 10 chronically HIV-1-infected individuals undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Nine subjects received smallpox vaccination as children while one subject was never vaccinated against smallpox. All the subjects had CD4 counts >400 cells/mm(3) and 8 out of 10 had undetectable viral loads. MVA was able to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses in the majority of individuals. Vaccinia-specific antibodies were mainly of the IgG class while T cells specific to vaccinia were predominantly CD8(+). The immune responses were maintained over 1 year. Similar vaccinia specific humoral immune responses were observed when our cohort of HIV-1-infected individuals was compared to smallpox-vaccinated healthy subjects. The observed immune responses suggest that the highly attenuated MVA could be used as a substitute vaccine against smallpox in chronically HIV-1-infected individuals undergoing HAART."
8611,0.001,1.0000,"Approximately 50% of late-stage HIV patients develop CXCR4-tropic (X4) virus in addition to CCR5-tropic (R5) virus. X4 emergence occurs with a sharp decline in CD4+ T cell counts and accelerated time to AIDS. Why this phenotypic switch to X4 occurs is not well understood. Previously, we used numerical simulations of a mathematical model to show that across much of parameter space a promising new class of antiretroviral treatments, CCR5 inhibitors, can accelerate X4 emergence and immunodeficiency. Here, we show that mathematical model to be a minimal activation-based HIV model that produces a spontaneous switch to X4 virus at a clinically-representative time point, while also matching in vivo data showing X4 and R5 coexisting and competing to infect memory CD4+ T cells. Our analysis shows that X4 avoids competitive exclusion from an initially fitter R5 virus due to X4v unique ability to productively infect nave CD4+ T cells. We further justify the generalized conditions under which this minimal model holds, implying that a phenotypic switch can even occur when the fraction of activated nave CD4+ T cells increases at a slower rate than the fraction of activated memory CD4+ T cells. We find that it is the ratio of the fractions of activated nave and memory CD4+ T cells that must increase above a threshold to produce a switch. This occurs as the concentration of CD4+ T cells drops beneath a threshold. Thus, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which increases CD4+ T cell counts and decreases cellular activation levels, inhibits X4 viral growth. However, we show here that even in the simplest dual-strain framework, competition between R5 and X4 viruses often results in accelerated X4 emergence in response to CCR5 inhibition, further highlighting the potential danger of anti-CCR5 monotherapy in multi-strain HIV infection."
5070,0.001,1.0000,"The principle of directly observed therapy (DOT) has its roots in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), for which DOT programs have improved cure rates in hard-to-reach populations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and TB affect similar populations, and there are concerns about both regarding the development of drug resistance associated with poor adherence to therapy. Accordingly, DOT may benefit certain HIV-infected people who have difficulty adhering to highly active antiretroviral therapy. However, important differences exist in the treatment of these diseases that raise questions about how DOT can be adapted to HIV therapy. DOT for management of HIV infection has been effective among prisoners and in pilot programs in Haiti, Rhode Island, and Florida. Although DOT can successfully treat HIV infection in marginalized populations in the short term, a multitude of questions remain. This review provides an account of the preliminary development of DOT programs for the treatment of HIV-infected individuals."
1488,0.001,1.0000,"We have used computer-assisted cytokine ELISA spot analysis to measure the frequencies, the type of cytokine, and the amount of cytokine produced by individual recall Ag-specific CD4 memory cells in freshly isolated blood. We studied the memory cells specific for tetanus toxoid and purified protein derivative in 18 healthy individuals and in 22 HIV-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In healthy individuals, the frequency, cytokine signature, and cytokine production per cell of these memory cells were stable over time. Although it is presently unclear whether the maintenance of the memory T cell pool depends upon Ag persistence, cross-reactive Ag stimulation, or cytokine-driven bystander stimulations and expansions, our data strongly argue for a stable memory cell pool in healthy individuals. In HIV patients, however, the frequency of these memory cells was a function of the viral load. The decreased numbers of functional memory cells in patients with high viral loads might provide one mechanism behind the immunodeficient state. Although the cytokine output per cell was unaffected in most patients (20 of 24), in some patients (4 of 24) it was >100-fold reduced, which might provide an additional mechanism to account for the reduced immunocompetence of these patients. The ability to visualize directly and quantify the cytokine produced by the low frequency memory cells in freshly isolated blood that have been physiologically stimulated by Ag should aid comprehensive studies of the Ag-specific memory cell pool in vivo, in health and disease."
6023,0.001,1.0000,"The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has considerably improved the quality of life and has increased the survival of HIV-infected individuals. Although HAART can successfully suppress viral replication in the long term, it is not without significant toxicity, which can seriously compromise treatment effectiveness. Moreover, the rapid rate of virus mutation and subsequent emergence of drug-resistant HIV variants threaten the longer-term efficacy of HIV treatment. The most common adverse effects caused by HAART include a metabolic syndrome with lipodystrophy, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance, deterioration in the clinical status due to various exaggerated local and systemic inflammatory reactions during the immunerestoration disease, and various hepatic, peripheral and cardiac muscle, kidney, bone, bone marrow, retinal, ear, and skin toxicities. The heterogeneity in the organs affected by the different drugs and the morphological features observed in tissues in HAART-treated patients raise possible explanations including differential distribution or activation of these agents. Antiretroviral drugs from new classes, as well as new drugs from existing classes with favorable resistance and side effect profiles are in various stages of development. However, new tissue disorders will be certainly described in the future in patients treated with these drugs. The different pathophysiology of the main adverse effects and the less common known side effects of antiretroviral therapy against HIV are described here, with special emphasis on the histological features induced by HAART."
5847,0.001,1.0000,"Some mutations in the connection subdomain of the polymerase domain and in the RNase H domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) have been shown to contribute to resistance to RT inhibitors. However, the clinical relevance of such mutations is not well understood. To address this point we determined the prevalence of such mutations in a cohort of antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients (n=123) and assessed whether these substitutions are associated with drug resistance in vitro and in vivo. We report here significant differences in the prevalence of substitutions among subtype B, and non-subtype B HIV isolates. Specifically, the E312Q, G333E, G335D, V365I, A371V and A376S substitutions were present in 2-6% of subtype B, whereas the G335D and A371V substitutions were commonly observed in 69% and 75% of non-B HIV-1 isolates. We observed a significant decline in the viral loads of patients that were infected with HIV-1 carrying these substitutions and were subsequently treated with triple drug regimens, even in the case where zidovudine (AZT) was included in such regimens. We show here that, generally, such single substitutions at the connection subdomain or RNase H domain have no influence on drug susceptibility in vitro by themselves. Instead, they generally enhance AZT resistance in the presence of excision-enhancing mutations (EEMs, also known as thymidine analogue-associated mutations, TAMs). However, N348I, A376S and Q509L did confer varying amounts of nevirapine resistance by themselves, even in the absence of EEMs. Our studies indicate that several connection subdomain and RNase H domain substitutions typically act as pre-therapy polymorphisms."
6024,0.001,1.0000,"The selection of escape mutations has a major impact on immune control of infections with viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Viral evasion of CD8(+) T-cell responses leaves predictable combinations of escape mutations, termed HLA ""footprints."" The most clearly defined footprints are those associated with HLA alleles that are linked with successful control of HIV, such as HLA-B*57. Here we investigated the extent to which HLA footprint sites in HIV type 1 (HIV-1) are associated with viral evolution among and within clades. First, we examined the extent to which amino acid differences between HIV-1 clades share identity with sites of HLA-mediated selection pressure and observed a strong association, in particular with respect to sites of HLA-B selection (P < 10(-6)). Similarly, the sites of amino acid variability within a clade were found to overlap with sites of HLA-selected mutation. Second, we studied the impact of HLA selection on interclade phylogeny. Removing the sites of amino acid variability did not significantly affect clade-specific clustering, reflecting the central role of founder effects in establishing distinct clades. However, HLA footprints may underpin founder strains, and we show that amino acid substitutions between clades alter phylogeny, underlining a potentially substantial role for HLA in driving ongoing viral evolution. Finally, we investigated the impact of HLA selection on within-clade phylogeny and demonstrate that even a single HLA allele footprint can result in significant phylogenetic clustering of sequences. In conclusion, these data highlight the fact that HLA can be a strong selection force for both intra- and interclade HIV evolution at a population level."
6509,0.001,1.0000,"Like the CCR5 chemokine receptors of humans and rhesus macaques, the very homologous (approximately 98-99% identical) CCR5 of African green monkeys (AGMs) avidly binds beta-chemokines and functions as a coreceptor for simian immunodeficiency viruses. However, AGM CCR5 is a weak coreceptor for tested macrophage-tropic (R5) isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Correspondingly, gp120 envelope glycoproteins derived from R5 isolates of HIV-1 bind poorly to AGM CCR5. We focused on a unique extracellular amino acid substitution at the juncture of transmembrane helix 4 (TM4) and extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) (Arg for Gly at amino acid 163 (G163R)) as the likely source of the weak R5 gp120 binding and HIV-1 coreceptor properties of AGM CCR5. Accordingly, a G163R mutant of human CCR5 was severely attenuated in its ability to bind R5 gp120s and to mediate infection by R5 HIV-1 isolates. Conversely, the R163G mutant of AGM CCR5 was substantially strengthened as a coreceptor for HIV-1 and had improved R5 gp120 binding affinity relative to the wild-type AGM CCR5. These substitutions at amino acid position 163 had no effect on chemokine binding or signal transduction, suggesting the absence of structural alterations. The 2D7 monoclonal antibody has been reported to bind to ECL2 and to block HIV-1 binding and infection. Whereas 2D7 antibody binding to CCR5 was unaffected by the G163R mutation, it was prevented by a conservative ECL2 substitution (K171R), shared between rhesus and AGM CCR5s. Thus, it appears that the 2D7 antibody binds to an epitope that includes Lys-171 and may block HIV-1 infection mediated by CCR5 by occluding an HIV-1-binding site in the vicinity of Gly-163. In summary, our results identify a site for gp120 interaction that is critical for R5 isolates of HIV-1 in the central core of human CCR5, and we propose that this site collaborates with a previously identified region in the CCR5 amino terminus to enable gp120 binding and HIV-1 infections."
7134,0.001,1.0000,"In order to limit the interference of HIV-1 cellular nucleic acids in estimating viral load (VL), the feasibility of leukodepletion of a small whole-blood (WB) volume to eliminate only leukocyte cell content was investigated, using a selection of filters. The efficacy of leukocyte filtration was evaluated by counting, CD45 quantitative PCR, and HIV-1 DNA quantification. Plasma HIV-1 was tested by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. A specific, miniaturized filter was developed and tested for leukocyte and plasma virus retention, WB sample dilution, and filtration parameters in HIV-1-spiked WB samples. This device proved effective to retain >99.9% of white blood cells in 100 μl of WB without affecting plasma VL. The Samba sample preparation chemistry was adapted to use a leukodepleted WB sample for VL monitoring using the point-of-care Samba-1 semiautomated system. The clinical performance of the assay was evaluated by testing 207 consecutive venous EDTA WB samples from HIV-1-infected patients attending a CD4 testing clinic. Most patients were on antiretroviral treatment (ART), but their VL status was unknown. Compared to the Roche Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 test, the new Samba assay had a concordance of 96.5%. The use of the Samba system with a VL test for WB might contribute to HIV-1 ART management and reduce loss-to-follow-up rates in resource-limited settings. "
2854,0.001,1.0000,"In this study, we investigated the possibility of differential effects of protease inhibitor (PI)-containing (PI(+)) and PI-sparing (PI(-)) antiretroviral therapies (ART) on CD8(+) T cell apoptosis. We retrospectively analyzed both PD-1 expression and CD8(+) T cell apoptosis in a cross-sectional study of HIV-positive adolescents and young adults (mean age = 17.4 years), with perinatally or behaviorally acquired HIV infection. Fifty-one specimens of cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analyzed using 7-color flow cytometry: 20 from patients receiving PI(+) ART, 14 from PI(-) ART, and 17 from the untreated. The results showed that percentages of PD-1(+) CD8(+) T cells were strongly correlated with plasma viral loads regardless of treatment (p = 0.0001). The percentage of PD-1(+) CD8(+) T cells was also positively associated with percentages of Annexin V(+) CD8(+) T cells (p = 0.04) in the PI(+)-treated group. The fraction of apoptotic (Annexin V(+)) CD8(+) T cells was associated with viral load in the patients receiving ART that contained one or more protease inhibitors (p = 0.029), but not in the PI(-) or untreated groups. In summary, we found a direct correlation between PD-1 expression on CD8(+) T cells and HIV levels that was not affected by types of medications used in the ART of those adolescents, suggesting that virological success is necessary for PD-1 downregulation. CD8(+) T cell apoptosis was linked to high levels of PD-1 expression and HIV viremia. However, there was a higher degree of apoptosis among viremic patients receiving PI therapy, suggesting an immunologically adverse effect of continuing PI(+) therapy after virological failure."
5363,0.001,1.0000,"There is increasing evidence that CD8 lymphocytes may represent targets for infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in vivo whose destruction may contribute to the loss of immune function underlying AIDS. HIV-1 may infect thymic precursor cells destined to become CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes and contribute to the numerical decline in both subsets on disease progression. There is also evidence for the induction of CD4 expression and susceptibility to infection by HIV-1 of CD8 lymphocytes activated in vitro. To investigate the relationship between CD8 activation and infection by HIV-1 in vivo, activated subsets of CD8 lymphocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HIV-seropositive individuals were investigated for CD4 expression and HIV infection. Activated CD8 lymphocytes were identified by expression of CD69, CD71, and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II, the beta-chain of CD8, and the RO isoform of CD45. CD4(+) and CD4(-) CD8 lymphocytes, CD4 lymphocytes, other T cells, and non-T cells were purified using paramagnetic beads, and proviral sequences were quantified by PCR using primers from the long terminal repeat region. Frequencies of activated CD8 lymphocytes were higher in HIV-infected study subjects than in seronegative controls, and they frequently coexpressed CD4 (mean frequencies on CD69(+), CD71(+), and HLA class II(+) cells of 23, 37, and 8%, respectively, compared with 1 to 2% for nonactivated CD8 lymphocytes). The level of CD4 expression of the double-positive population approached that of mature CD4 lymphocytes. That CD4 expression renders CD8 cell susceptible to infection was indicated by their high frequency of infection in vivo; infected CD4(+) CD8 lymphocytes accounted for between 3 and 72% of the total proviral load in PBMCs from five of the eight study subjects investigated, despite these cells representing a small component of the PBMC population (<3%). Combined, these findings provide evidence that antigenic stimulation of CD8 lymphocytes in vivo induces CD4 expression that renders them susceptible to HIV infection and destruction. The specific targeting of responding CD8 lymphocytes may provide a functional explanation for the previously observed impairment of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) function disproportionate to their numerical decline in AIDS and for the deletion of specific clones of CTLs responding to HIV antigens."
4644,0.001,1.0000,"Korea is a low prevalence country for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and has an intermediate tuberculosis (TB) burden. We previously reported that the incidence of TB in HIV-infected patients was 9.6 cases per 100 person-years (P-Y) between 1988 and 1997. The aims of the present study were to measure any change in incidence from the previous study, and to identify risk factors for TB in HIV-infected patients. We reviewed all medical records of HIV-infected patients who were followed-up in one tertiary hospital between 1998 and 2010. Over the total observation period of 5858.33 P-Y, TB developed in 70 patients (1.19 cases per 100 P-Y; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-1.47 cases per 100 P-Y). Based on Poisson regression, one risk factor associated with TB was an initial CD4+ cell count below 200 cells/µL (relative risk, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.47-3.73). Mean CD4+ cell counts of pulmonary, extrapulmonary, and both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB were 179.8 cells/µL, 138.3 cells/µL, and 114.2 cells/µL, respectively (P = 0.55). In conclusion, the incidence of TB in HIV-infected patients has decreased since the previous study. An initial CD4+ cell count below 200 cells/µL is an independent risk factor for development of TB in HIV-infected patients."
3158,0.001,1.0000,"A case-control study was undertaken to determine risk factors for lactic acidosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients treated with nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). From May 1996 to June 2000, 9 patients with lactic acidosis (defined as a plasma lactic acid level of >5 mM and plasma pH of <7.38) were identified. Control patients were randomly selected from among a large cohort of patients who initiated a dual NRTI regimen in 1996 or after. Two factors were associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis: first, a creatinine clearance of <70 mL/min before lactic acidosis (OR, 15.8 [range, 3.0-86.5], P<10(-4)), and, second, a low nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count before the inception of NRTI therapy (OR, 8.4 [range, 1.2-infinity], P=.03). The total cumulative exposure to NRTIs was not associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, nor was the cumulative exposure to any of the 4 NRTIs studied. According to these results, monitoring of creatinine clearance, especially in patients with a low nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count, could lead to modifications in antiretroviral therapy in order to diminish the risk of occurrence of lactic acidosis."
8619,0.001,1.0000,"Liver toxicity is a common side effect of antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs. We studied the differences in liver dysfunction observed during anti-TB treatment between hepatitis B virus carriers (HBV) and noncarriers. Three hundred twenty-four patients on anti-TB drugs were recruited and followed up for 1 year. Forty-three patients with HBV and 276 non-HBV patients were included for analysis. Liver function tests and viral markers were monitored monthly. Liver biopsy was requested whenever the alanine transaminase (ALT) was persistently abnormal. Eighty-six HBV carriers who were not given anti-TB drugs were chosen as a second control and evaluated prospectively. The incidence of liver dysfunction was significantly higher in HBV carriers given anti-TB drugs (34.9%) when compared to noncarriers (9.4%, P <.001) and with HBV carriers not given anti-TB drugs (8.1%, P <.001). For patients given anti-TB drugs, HBV carriers who developed liver dysfunction were younger (P =.011) and had more severe liver injury compared with noncarriers (P =.008). By multiple logistic regression analysis, age (P =.002) and hepatitis B infection (P <.001) were the only 2 significant risk factors for hepatotoxicity related to anti-TB therapy."
4543,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry into cells is mediated by the surface-exposed envelope protein (SU) gp120, which binds to cellular CD4 and chemokine receptors, triggering the membrane fusion activity of the transmembrane (TM) protein gp41. The core of gp41 comprises an N-terminal triple-stranded coiled coil and an antiparallel C-terminal helical segment which is packed against the exterior of the coiled coil and is thought to correspond to a fusion-activated conformation. The available gp41 crystal structures lack the conserved disulfide-bonded loop region which, in human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and murine leukemia virus TM proteins, mediates a chain reversal, connecting the antiparallel N- and C-terminal regions. Mutations in the HTLV-1 TM protein gp21 disulfide-bonded loop/chain reversal region adversely affected fusion activity without abolishing SU-TM association (A. L. Maerz, R. J. Center, B. E. Kemp, B. Kobe, and P. Poumbourios, J. Virol. 74:6614-6621, 2000). We now report that in contrast to our findings with HTLV-1, conservative substitutions in the HIV-1 gp41 disulfide-bonded loop/chain reversal region abolished association with gp120. While the mutations affecting gp120-gp41 association also affected cell-cell fusion activity, HIV-1 glycoprotein maturation appeared normal. The mutant glycoproteins were processed, expressed at the cell surface, and efficiently immunoprecipitated by conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies. The gp120 association site includes aromatic and hydrophobic residues on either side of the gp41 disulfide-bonded loop and a basic residue within the loop. The HIV-1 gp41 disulfide-bonded loop/chain reversal region is a critical gp120 contact site; therefore, it is also likely to play a central role in fusion activation by linking CD4 plus chemokine receptor-induced conformational changes in gp120 to gp41 fusogenicity. These gp120 contact residues are present in diverse primate lentiviruses, suggesting conservation of function."
9521,0.001,1.0000,"Although the pathogenetic significance of hepatitis B virus x protein (HBxAg) in chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma has already been studied, the comparative analyses of both the actual serum HBxAg levels and antibody production against various HBx epitopes have been examined to lesser extent. We have simultaneously investigated the relationship between antibody production (IgG and IgM) against the HBxAg fragments and HBxAg level in the sera of patients with acute (14) or chronic hepatitis (80) and symptomless carriers (12). A recently developed sandwich-type ELISA was used for the quantitative measurements of HBxAg. Overlapping recombinant and synthetic antigens were used to map the fine epitope specificities of circulating anti-HBx antibodies. In acute hepatitis, we have found high and homogenous correlation in the IgM type immune responses against all the examined HBxAg regions. Moreover, strong correlation has been observed between IgG type immune responses to a characteristic C-terminal region (C1: 79-117) and the longest fragment (X: 10-143). Moderate correlation has been found between HBxAg concentration and the IgG type anti-HBx antibody levels against C-terminus of HBxAg in patients with chronic hepatitis. In the case of symptomless carriers, there were also demonstrable associations in the immune responses against the C-terminal sequences; however, significant correlations were found for antibody production against the N-terminal region as well. The examinations show that the C-terminal sequence, responsible for transactivation, promotes an efficient IgG antibody response in all three groups of patients, whereas the negative regulator N-terminal part of the HBxAg molecule for the most part does not trigger antibody production. This suggests that the immune responses against various - biologically active - epitopes of the HBxAg may have a different role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis and may be used as prognostic markers in human HBV infections."

The study was done blindly using Shikata et al.'s orcein staining on fixed and frozen material and direct immunoperoxidase on frozen material with antisera specific for surface (anti-HBs) and core (anti-HBc) antigens of HBV. No liver staining could be found in the 98 HBsAg seronegative patients. Among the 28 HBsAg seropositive patients, only 3 showed positive staining: 1 patient with acute viral hepatitis showed nuclear staining with anti-HBc; 2 patients with postnecrotic cirrhosis showed cytoplasmic staining with anti-HBs and/or orcein, and one of them also showed nuclear staining with anti-HBc. In contrast, among the 38 chronic carriers, 25 showed positive cytoplasmic staining with anti-HBs and/or orcein, while one of them (with chronic aggressive hepatitis) also showed nuclear staining with anti-HBc. Anti-HBs and orcein staining are equally sensitive and specific for the detection of HBsAg in hepatocytes; discrepant results can be attributed to sampling error of distribution of HBsAg in small liver fragments."

Since the HBV genotype F is the most prevalent in the country, the goal of this study was to obtain full HBV genome sequences from patients infected chronically in order to determine their subgenotypes and the occurrence of resistance-associated mutations. Twenty-one serum samples from antiviral drug-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B were subjected to full-length PCR amplification, and both strands of the whole genomes were fully sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses were performed along with reference sequences available from GenBank (n = 290). The sequences were aligned using Clustal X and edited in the SE-AL software. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were conducted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations (MCMC) for 10 million generations in order to obtain the substitution tree using BEAST. The sequences were also analyzed for the presence of primary drug resistance mutations using CodonCode Aligner Software. The phylogenetic analyses indicated that all sequences were found to be the HBV subgenotype F1b, clustered into four different groups, suggesting that diverse lineages of this subgenotype may be circulating within this population of Chilean patients."
8622,0.001,1.0000,"We investigated the specific and cross-reactive CD8 T cell immunity to three natural variants (of different geno/serotype) of the small hepatitis B surface Ag (or S protein). The D(d)-binding variants of the S(201-209) epitope showed different immunogenicity. The loss of the consensus C-terminal (P9) anchor abrogated its immunogenicity. In contrast, a conservative (serine vs asparagine) exchange at P7 primed cross-reactive CD8 T cells that preferentially recognized the priming variant. Cross-reactive CD8 T cell responses to a variant could be primed in mice tolerant to an alternative variant of the D(d)-binding S(201-209) peptide. Loss of the C-terminal (P10) anchor in S(185-194) eliminated its immunogenicity in HLA-A*0201(A2)-transgenic mice but two conservative exchanges (leucine vs valine in P2, and leucine vs isoleucine in P6) in S(208-216) generated cross-reactive CD8 T cell responses with strong preference for the priming variant. Similar cross-reactive recognition of variant envelope epitopes were also found in S(208-216)-specific CD8 T cells from hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients. Distinct CD8 T cell populations cross-reactive to natural variants of class I-restricted HBV epitopes can be primed by vaccination (of mice) or natural infection (of humans), and they may play a role in the ""spontaneous remission"" or the specific immunotherapy of chronic HBV infection."
10007,0.001,1.0000,"The beneficial effects of Bifidobacteria on health have been widely accepted. Patients with chronic liver disease have varying degrees of intestinal microflora imbalance with a decrease of total Bifidobacterial counts. Since different properties have been attributed to different Bifidobacterium species and there is no information available for the detailed changes in the genus Bifidobacterium in patients with chronic liver disease heretofore, it is meaningful to investigate the structure of this bacterium at the species level in these patients. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition of intestinal Bifidobacterium in patients with hepatitis B virus-induced chronic liver disease. Nested-PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), clone library, and real-time quantitative PCR were performed on the fecal samples of 16 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB patients), 16 patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis (HBV cirrhotics), and 15 healthy subjects (Controls). Though there was no significant difference in the diversity among the three groups (P = 0.196), Bifidobacterium dentium seems to be specifically enhanced in patients as the PCR-DGGE profiles showed, which was further validated by clone library and real-time quantitative PCR. In contrast to the B. dentium, Bifidobacterium                         catenulatum/Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum were detected less frequently in the predominant profile and by quantitative PCR in HBV cirrhotics than in the controls, and the level of this species was also significantly different between these two groups (P = 0.023). Although having no quantitative difference among the three groups, Bifidobacterium longum was less commonly detected in HBV cirrhotics than in CHB patients and Controls by quantitative PCR (P = 0.011). Thus, the composition of intestinal Bifidobacterium was deeply altered in CHB and HBV cirrhotic patients with a shift from beneficial species to opportunistic pathogens. The results provide further insights into the dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in patients with hepatitis B virus-induced chronic liver disease and might potentially serve as guidance for the probiotics interventions of these diseases."
2253,0.001,1.0000,"In a prospective, non-randomized, pilot study, we evaluated the efficacy of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination in inhibiting HBV replication of chronic hepatitis B. Fourteen consecutive chronic HBs antigen carriers received standard vaccination with three injections of the GenHevac B vaccine, one month apart. All the patients had active HBV replication with chronic hepatitis but not cirrhosis. They were compared to a historical group of 34 patients who fulfilled the same inclusion criteria. Over the 6-month follow-up period after the first injection, serum HBV DNA became undetectable in 3 patients (21.4%). Four additional patients (28.6%) showed a significant decrease in HBV replication. In 4 cases, the disappearance of or decrease in HBV DNA was preceded by an increase in transaminase activities, which was also observed in one patient who did not modify his viral replication. Vaccination was otherwise uneventful. By contrast, during a mean follow-up of 40 months, only 3 (9%) of the 34 unvaccinated patients who served as controls lost serum HBV DNA, giving a 6-month HBV DNA disappearance rate of 1%. In sum, vaccination appeared able to reduce or stop HBV replication in half of the chronic HBsAg carriers with chronic hepatitis. This additional therapeutic tool may enhance the rate of response to interferon-alpha therapy, which is dependent on the level of HBV replication. Thus, immunotherapy should be considered of potential importance for the treatment of HBV infection."
1892,0.001,1.0000,"The nucleocapsid (HBcAg) of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been suggested as a carrier moiety for vaccine purposes. We investigated the influence of the position of the inserted epitope within hybrid HBcAg particles on antigenicity and immunogenicity. For this purpose, genes coding for neutralizing epitopes of the pre-S region of the HBV envelope proteins were inserted at the amino terminus, the amino terminus through a precore linker sequence, the truncated carboxy terminus, or an internal site of HBcAg by genetic engineering and were expressed in Escherichia coli. All purified hybrid HBc/pre-S polyproteins were particulate. Amino- and carboxy-terminal-modified hybrid HBc particles retained HBcAg antigenicity and immunogenicity. In contrast, insertion of a pre-S(1) sequence between HBcAg residues 75 and 83 abrogated recognition of HBcAg by 5 of 6 anti-HBc monoclonal antibodies and diminished recognition by human polyclonal anti-HBc. Predictably, HBcAg-specific immunogenicity was also reduced. With respect to the inserted epitopes, a pre-S(1) epitope linked to the amino terminus of HBcAg was not surface accessible and not immunogenic. A pre-S(1) epitope fused to the amino terminus through a precore linker sequence was surface accessible and highly immunogenic. A carboxy-terminal-fused pre-S(2) sequence was also surface accessible but weakly immunogenic. Insertion of a pre-S(1) epitope at the internal site resulted in the most efficient anti-pre-S(1) antibody response. Furthermore, immunization with hybrid HBc/pre-S particles exclusively primed T-helper cells specific for HBcAg and not the inserted epitope. These results indicate that the position of the inserted B-cell epitope within HBcAg is critical to its immunogenicity."

A retrospective study of participants consecutively recruited at the UCSD HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program examined effects of combined ART and SGAs on body mass index (BMI), nonfasting serum lipids, diabetes mellitus (DM) incidence, and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Metabolic outcome variables and covariates were compared using t-tests, Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests. Linear and logistic multivariable models explored metabolic outcomes for participants taking (SGA+) or not taking (SGA-) concomitant SGAs, after controlling for demographic and HIV disease- and ART-related covariates. Of 2229 HIV-infected participants, 12% (N=258) were treated with SGAs. In multivariable models adjusted for relevant covariates, the SGA+ group had significantly higher mean triglycerides, significantly higher odds of DM, significantly higher MAPs and marginally higher BMI. The use of SGAs in HIV-infected adults taking ART was independently associated with worse indicators of MetS and cardiovascular risk. Aggressive monitoring for the metabolic complications from concurrent SGA and ART is indicated in all patients receiving these medication combinations. "

Comparisons were made between hospitals that are designated by the New York State Department of Health as comprehensive treatment centers--designated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) centers--and all other hospitals. For patients who had been on PCP prophylaxis before admission, 34% had documentation of positive histologic evidence for PCP infection during the studied hospitalization period. Of all patients not on PCP prophylaxis at the time of admission, 94% had at least one of the diagnostic tests for PCP done during the PCP hospitalization. Eighty-one percent of all patients had either pulse oximetry or an arterial blood gas determination. Seventy-seven percent of all patients with a PO2 equal to or less than 70 mm Hg received steroids. All eligible patients received one of nine possible treatment combinations, which included either single drug therapy, multiple drug therapy, or participation in a clinical trial. Sixteen percent of eligible patients had no documentation of receiving PCP medication at discharge. Proportions receiving diagnostic or treatment interventions were usually higher in designated AIDS centers than in non-designated AIDS centers."

Of 270 participants tested for HTLV-I/II, 21 (8%) were seropositive. Of those, 15 (71%) had HTLV-II-specific sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 1 (5%) had both HTLV-I- and -II-specific sequences; 3 persons with indeterminate serologic results were also PCR-positive for HTLV-II. HTLV-II infection was significantly associated with older age but was not predicted by sex, race, socioeconomic status, transfusion history, or HIV infection status. Behavioral factors since 1978, such as duration and frequency of intravenous drug use, needle sharing, visits to shooting galleries, or number of sex partners, were also not associated with HTLV-II infection. These findings are in contrast with the association of these risk factors with HIV in this group and suggest that, among IVDUs, HTLV-II is an older endemic infection that is less efficiently transmitted than HIV."
2940,0.001,1.0000,"Objective To assess the implementation of HIV-related interventions for patients with tuberculosis (TB), as well as TB treatment outcomes in patients coinfected with HIV in Brazil in 2011. Methods This was a cross-sectional, operational research study of HIV-related interventions among TB cases and the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of TB-HIV coinfected patients. It also used a retrospective cohort design to determine the association between antiretroviral therapy (ART) and favorable TB treatment outcomes. The source of data was a linkage of 2011 administrative health databases used by the National TB and HIV/AIDS Programs. Results Of 73 741 new cases of TB reported, 63.6% (46 865 patients) were tested for HIV; 10.3% were positive. Of patients with HIV, 45.9% or 3 502 were on ART. TB favorable outcome was achieved in 63.1% or 2 205 coinfected patients on ART and in only 35.4% or 1 459 of those not on ART. On multivariate analysis, the relative risk for the association between ART and TB treatment success was 1.72 (95% Confidence Interval = 1.64-1.81). Conclusions The linkage between national TB and HIV datasets has created a convenient baseline for ongoing monitoring of HIV testing, ART use, and TB treatment outcomes among coinfected patients. The low rates of HIV screening and ART use in 2011 need to be improved. The association between ART and treatment success adds to the evidence supporting timely initiation of ART for all patients with TB-HIV coinfection."
4779,0.001,1.0000,"New-generation gels that deliver potent antiretroviral drugs against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 have renewed hopes for topical prophylaxis as a prevention strategy. Previous preclinical research with monkey models suggested that high concentrations and drug combinations are needed for high efficacy. We evaluated two long-acting reverse transcriptase inhibitors, tenofovir (TFV) and emtricitabine (FTC), by using a twice-weekly repeat challenge macaque model and showed that a preexposure vaginal application of gel with 1% TFV alone or in combination with 5% FTC fully protected macaques from a total of 20 exposures to simian-human immunodeficiency virus SF162p3. FTC and TFV were detected in plasma 30 min after vaginal application, suggesting rapid absorption. FTC was detected more frequently than TFV and showed higher levels, reflecting the fivefold-higher concentration of this drug than of TFV. Two of 12 repeatedly exposed but protected macaques showed limited T-cell priming, which did not induce resistance to infection when macaques were rechallenged. Thus, single drugs with durable antiviral activity can provide highly effective topical prophylaxis and overcome the need for noncoital use or for drug combinations which are more complex and costly to formulate and approve."

Although secondary data based on official mortality statistics indicate a sharp decrease in AIDS mortality, few if any studies tried to estimate the prognosis for patients with HIV who have been followed from the beginning of the HAART era. An observational study, with retrospective and prospective components, was done in 233 adult HIV-1-infected subjects who were recruited in the last 10 years at the outpatient sector of the Secondary Immunodeficiencies Clinic of the Department of Dermatology, Hospital das Clinicas da FMUSP, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The definition of AIDS followed the guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in 1987. One hundred sixty patients were asymptomatic, 46 had AIDS, 24 had AIDS-related complex, and 3 presented with acute infection at study entry. Twenty-nine (18%) of the asymptomatic subjects developed AIDS during follow-up, with 5 (3%) deaths. Among the 46 AIDS cases at entry, 7 (17%) died during follow-up. Thus, a total of 12 people (5.2%) died of AIDS in this cohort over a mean follow-up of 5.2 years and 24 people were lost to follow-up (10.3%). Ninety percent of the survivors were on combined therapy (82% with 3 or more drugs, and 8% with 2 drugs), while 10% were not taking antiretrovirals. People with AIDS at entry were 5 times more likely to die during this period compared to patients who were asymptomatic at entry (p = 0.006). Women showed better outcomes than men, reflecting differences in CD4+ T-cell counts at study entry. All but 1 patient progressed to AIDS during the pre-HAART era (before 1996). In spite of its recent decline, mortality from AIDS-related conditions remains an important public health issue."
9856,0.001,1.0000,Introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been associated with many changes in the complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A cohort of 25 HIV patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) treated with HAART experienced a median survival of >46 weeks. This is an improvement in prognosis compared with recent historic experience and correlated with HIV RNA viral load reductions. We conclude that current HIV therapy is important in improving the outlook of PML in the setting of HIV.

192,0.001,1.0000,"Functional impairment of T cells is characteristic of many chronic mouse and human viral infections. The inhibitory receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1; also known as PDCD1), a negative regulator of activated T cells, is markedly upregulated on the surface of exhausted virus-specific CD8 T cells in mice. Blockade of this pathway using antibodies against the PD ligand 1 (PD-L1, also known as CD274) restores CD8 T-cell function and reduces viral load. To investigate the role of PD-1 in a chronic human viral infection, we examined PD-1 expression on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific CD8 T cells in 71 clade-C-infected people who were naive to anti-HIV treatments, using ten major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I tetramers specific for frequently targeted epitopes. Here we report that PD-1 is significantly upregulated on these cells, and expression correlates with impaired HIV-specific CD8 T-cell function as well as predictors of disease progression: positively with plasma viral load and inversely with CD4 T-cell count. PD-1 expression on CD4 T cells likewise showed a positive correlation with viral load and an inverse correlation with CD4 T-cell count, and blockade of the pathway augmented HIV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell function. These data indicate that the immunoregulatory PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is operative during a persistent viral infection in humans, and define a reversible defect in HIV-specific T-cell function. Moreover, this pathway of reversible T-cell impairment provides a potential target for enhancing the function of exhausted T cells in chronic HIV infection."
1815,0.001,1.0000,"An enhanced, refocused research agenda is critical to reducing the burden of tuberculosis (TB) in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic in developing countries. TB threatens HIV-infected patients before and after initiation of antiretroviral therapy, is difficult to diagnose, is rapidly fatal when it is drug resistant, and is being spread in clinics and hospitals. Research priorities include improved and point-of-care TB diagnostics; TB treatment and prevention during HIV infection, drug-resistant TB, and childhood TB; and optimization of TB and HIV program integration. With new TB diagnostics and drugs reaching approval, research must focus on effectively deploying these advancements. Research must include evaluations of individual, household, health care, and community approaches. Studies must apply implementation science to determine how to increase and adapt effective interventions to reduce TB burden in the context of HIV infection. Investment in this research will improve the lives of persons infected with HIV and contribute to efforts to reduce the global TB burden."

The overall prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection was 51% (CI: 46.1 - 55.8), with 7.9% (CI: 5.3 - 10.5) for HBsAg, 45.1% (CI: 40.3 - 49.9) for anti-HBc and 32.3% (CI: 27.5 - 36.8) for anti-HBs. After adjustment using logistic regression, hepatitis B serological markers were associated with the following variables: age, marital status and sexual preference. The frequency of hepatitis B markers was 28.7% in heterosexuals and 68.8% in homo/bisexuals (CI: 3.50 - 9.08; OR: 5.63; p=0.000). In married people the frequency was 31% and 58.7% in single people (CI: 1.29 - 3.63); OR: 2.16; p=0.003).

Self-report of marijuana use was assessed through audio computer-assisted self-administered interviewing (ACASI). Urines were tested for marijuana at a certified laboratory by using the enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique. Conditional kappas for 2-, 5-, and 7-day self-reports were 0.57, 0.71, and 0.69, respectively. Maximum sensitivity was obtained from a combination of ACASI and urine drug testing.

During the first 11 months of the program, testing was offered at 20,843 patient visits and was accepted at 15,181 (73%) of these; 612 (4%) individual clients had results that were positive for HIV. Four hundred thirty-seven (71%) seropositive clients returned for test results, post-test counseling, and further evaluation. Most HIV-infected clients were single, and black men accounted for 75% of seropositive individuals. HIV-infected women tended to be younger than infected men (7% of the female clients were adolescents). Although homosexual activity, intravenous drug use, and sex with a partner at risk were common risk factors for seropositive clients, after two interviews 17% of men and 38% of infected women did not report traditional risk factors for HIV infection. Most clients were asymptomatic or had generalized lymphadenopathy at the time of HIV diagnosis. Health care resources for these individuals were limited; 62% of men and 85% of women either had no health insurance or received public assistance. Routine, voluntary, confidential HIV counseling and testing is a practical, effective means to identify HIV-infected individuals among clients being treated at STD clinics. Identification of these individuals early in the course of infection provides opportunities to implement early follow-up and therapy, to counsel clients to help prevent further spread of infection, and to obtain useful information for projecting future health care needs and policy."
1793,0.001,1.0000,"Hematologic manifestations in perinatally human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected children have not been widely described in literature. Knowledge of the spontaneous evolution of this disease is essential for achieving optimum care of patients. We analyzed the main hematologic manifestations developed in the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy period of 1217 children, collected from the Italian Register for HIV infection. In 111 patients, the hematologic sign was the first clinical manifestation. Among anemic and neutropenic patients, the fraction of patients in clinical class C was significantly higher than the corresponding fraction in class B (76%, P<0.001 and 74%, P<0.01), and significantly lower in thrombocytopenic patients (42%, P<0.001). The overall progression from class B to C was overlapping to the control group; when separated, however, anemic patients progressed faster (P<0.0001), whereas thrombocytopenic patients had a slower progression, similar to the nonhematologic patients in class A. Anemic patients had a worse prognosis than the control group (P<0.0001), similar to the nonhematologic patients in class C. Finally, the negative prognostic value of anemia was independent from the immunologic condition. Anemia was associated with greater mortality risks. Thrombocytopenia appeared, paradoxically, to be a positive prognostic factor within class B. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification presently defines hematologic patients as a single entity; a finer distinction could improve its relevance for the rational design of prevention and therapy."
4530,0.001,1.0000,"In the United States, 10 million inmates are released every year, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevalence is several-fold greater in criminal justice populations than in the community. Few effective linkage-to-the-community programs are currently available for prisoners infected with HIV. As a result, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is seldom continued after release, and virological and immunological outcomes worsen. Poor HIV treatment outcomes result from a myriad of obstacles that released prisoners face upon reentering the community, including homelessness, lack of medical insurance, relapse to drug and alcohol use, and mental illness. This article will focus on 5 distinct factors that contribute significantly to treatment outcomes for released prisoners infected with HIV and have profound individual and public health implications: (1) adaptation of case management services to facilitate linkage to care; (2) continuity of cART; (3) treatment of substance use disorders; (4) continuity of mental illness treatment; and (5) reducing HIV-associated risk-taking behaviors as part of secondary prevention."
2454,0.001,1.0000,"A number of infected individuals develop neuropathological disorders, such as AIDS dementia complex (ADC), as a consequence of HIV/AIDS. The biological features governing HIV entry and tropism in different brain cell types remain unclear, as do the genetics of the virus regulating these events and the neuropathogenic processes within the brain tissues. HIV-1 was isolated from the right and left parietal, occipital, and frontal lobes of the brain cortex of three HIV-1-infected patients: two with ADC and one without. The viral strains were studied from the innate tissues and various primary cell cultures. The kinetics and tropism of viral strains from different brain regions showed clear differences on various primary cell types (monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and T cells), which could discriminate between biological behavior of HIV-1 strains from patients with and without ADC. The variable effect of different donor cells on tropism was also clearly evident. The majority (with a few exceptions) of isolates from different brain regions of all three patients used CCR5 as coreceptor for entry. The consistent CCR5 use, macrophage tropism, and non-syncytium-inducing phenotype were the main characteristics of the brain-derived HIV-1 strains from all three patients. Importantly, viral strains derived directly from innate brain tissue of the patient without ADC showed some differences from the cultured variants of the same patient, whereas those from brain tissue of the patients with ADC were more similar to the culture-adapted strains. This suggests that the emergence of primary cell type-adapted isolates during ADC may play a crucial role in the development and progression of the neuropathology associated with ADC. The different genotypes residing in different areas of brain combined with their differential tropism and coreceptor use suggest that neurotropic variants exist that may be governing the neurological manifestation of HIV disease in infected patients."
282,0.001,1.0000,"Global human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) diversity may require engineering vaccines to express antigens representing strains prevalent in the target population of vaccine testing. The majority (90%) of incident infections in Thailand are genetic subtype E, with a small percentage of subtype B infections in the intravenous drug user populations. We have evaluated and compared the binding and HIV-1 neutralizing properties of serum antibodies induced in baboons by CHO cell-expressed monomeric gp120 derived from a CCR5-using (R5) subtype E primary HIV-1CM235 or a CXCR4-using (X4) subtype B T-cell line-adapted (TCLA) HIV-1SF2 isolate. In contrast to the subtype-specific HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies induced with recombinant HIV-1SF2 gp120 (rgp120SF2), rgp120CM235 immunization induced antibodies capable of neutralizing both subtype E and subtype B TCLA HIV-1 isolates. However, neither immunogen induced antibodies capable of neutralizing primary HIV-1 isolates. Antibody induced by rgp120CM235 preferentially bound natively folded gp120 and retained strong cross-reactivity against multiple gp120 strains within subtype E as well as subtype B. In contrast, antibody responses to rgp120SF2 were directed predominantly to linear epitopes poorly exposed on native gp120 and had more limited cross-recognition of divergent gp120. Fine epitope mapping revealed differences in antibody specificities. While both rgp120CM235 and rgp120SF2 induced antibodies to regions within C1, V1/V2, V3, and C5, unique responses were induced by rgp120CM235 to multiple epitopes within C2 and by rgp120SF2 to multiple epitopes within C3, V4, and C4. These data demonstrate that strain and/or phenotypic differences of HIV-1 subunit gp120 immunogens can substantially alter antibody binding specificities and subsequent HIV-1 neutralizing capacity."
6986,0.001,1.0000,"In medicine, understanding the pathophysiologic basis of exceptional circumstances has led to an enhanced understanding of biology. We have studied the circumstance of HIV-infected patients in whom antiretroviral therapy results in immunologic benefit, despite virologic failure. In such patients, two protease mutations, I54V and V82A, occur more frequently. Expressing HIV protease containing these mutations resulted in less cell death, caspase activation, and nuclear fragmentation than wild type (WT) HIV protease or HIV protease containing other mutations. The impaired induction of cell death was also associated with impaired cleavage of procaspase 8, a requisite event for HIV protease mediated cell death. Primary CD4 T cells expressing I54V or V82A protease underwent less cell death than with WT or other mutant proteases. Human T cells infected with HIV containing these mutations underwent less cell death and less Casp8p41 production than WT or HIV containing other protease mutations, despite similar degrees of viral replication. The reductions in cell death occurred both within infected cells, as well as in uninfected bystander cells. These data indicate that single point mutations within HIV protease which are selected in vivo can significantly impact the ability of HIV to kill CD4 T cells, while not impacting viral replication. Therefore, HIV protease regulates both HIV replication as well as HIV induced T cell depletion, the hallmark of HIV pathogenesis."

After each TPEx procedure (2000 mL of fluid exchanged per session), HIV-1 genome molecule levels dropped to 58%-63% of the basal level but rapidly reverted to pre-TPEx values (doubling time = 3.50-4.04 h). Of interest, mobilization of extravascular cell-free virions (on average, 5.15 x 10(4) viral genome molecules/h) had already occurred during TPEx. After three daily TPEx procedures, HIV-1 viremia rebounded to basal values, while HIV-1 proviruses and viral transcripts in peripheral blood lymphocytes constantly tested at stable levels. Overall, this study extends previous analyses of the rate of HIV-1 turnover, using an alternative approach to the use of antiretroviral drugs, and it provides, albeit indirectly, insights into the amount and dynamic features of extravascular cell-free virus."
9267,0.001,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can control human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) replication in infected individuals. Unfortunately, patients remain persistently infected owing to the establishment of latent infection requiring that ART be maintained indefinitely. One strategy being pursued involves the development of latency-reversing agents (LRAs) to eliminate the latent arm of the infection. One class of molecules that has been tested for LRA activity is the epigenetic modulating compounds histone deacetylases inhibitors (HDACis). Previously, initial screening of these molecules typically commenced using established cell models of viral latency, and although certain drugs such as the HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid demonstrated strong activity in these models, it did not translate to comparable activity with patient samples. Here we developed a primary cell model of viral latency using primary resting CD4+ T cells infected with Vpx-complemented HIV-1 and found that the activation profile using previously described LRAs mimicked that obtained with patient samples. This primary cell model was used to evaluate 94 epigenetic compounds. Not surprisingly, HDACis were found to be the strongest activators. However, within the HDACi class, the most active LRAs with the least pronounced toxicity contained a benzamide functional moiety with a pyridyl cap group, as exemplified by the HDACi chidamide. The results indicate that HDACis with a benzamide moiety and pyridyl cap group should be considered for further drug development in the pursuit of a successful viral clearance strategy."
4206,0.001,1.0000,"The chemokine receptors CCR-5 and CXCR-4, and possibly CCR-3, are the principal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptors, apparently interacting with HIV-1 envelope, in association with CD4. Cell lines coexpressing CD4 and these chemokine receptors were infected with a panel of seven primary HIV-2 isolates passaged in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and three laboratory HIV-2 strains passaged in T-cell lines. The CCR-5, CCR-3, and CXCR-4 coreceptors could all be used by HIV-2. The ability to use CXCR-4 represents a major difference between HIV-2 and the closely related simian immunodeficiency viruses. Most HIV-2 strains using CCR-5 could also use CCR-3, sometimes with similar efficiencies. As observed for HIV-1, the usage of CCR-5 or CCR-3 was observed principally for HIV-2 strains derived from asymptomatic individuals, while HIV-2 strains derived from AIDS patients used CXCR-4. However, there were several exceptions, and the patterns of coreceptor usage seemed more complex for HIV-2 than for HIV-1. The two T-tropic HIV-2 strains tested used CXCR-4 and not CCR-5, while T-tropic HIV-1 can generally use both. Moreover, among five primary HIV-2 strains all unable to use CXCR-4, three could replicate in CCR-5-negative PBMC, which has not been reported for HIV-1. These observations suggest that the CCR-5 coreceptor is less important for HIV-2 than for HIV-1 and indicate that HIV-2 can use other cell entry pathways and probably other coreceptors. One HIV-2 isolate replicating in normal or CCR-5-negative PBMC failed to infect CXCR-4+ cells or the U87MG-CD4 and sMAGI cell lines, which are permissive to infection by HIV-2 but not by HIV-1. This suggests the existence of several HIV-2-specific coreceptors, which are differentially expressed in cell lines and PBMC."
5488,0.001,1.0000,"CD4 T-cell-specific memory antiviral responses to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were investigated in 16 patients with documented primary HIV-1 infection (4 of the 16 subjects also had primary CMV infection) and compared with those observed in patients with chronic HIV-1 and CMV coinfection. Virus-specific memory CD4 T cells were characterized on the basis of the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7. HIV-1- and CMV-specific interferon-gamma-secreting CD4 T cells were detected in patients with primary and chronic HIV-1 and CMV coinfection and were mostly contained in the cell population lacking expression of CCR7. The magnitude of the primary CMV-specific CD4 T-cell response was significantly greater than that of chronic CMV infection, whereas there were no differences between primary and chronic HIV-1-specific CD4 T-cell responses. A substantial proportion of CD4(+)CCR7(-) T cells were infected with HIV-1. These results advance the characterization of antiviral memory CD4 T-cell response and the delineation of the potential mechanisms that likely prevent the generation of a robust CD4 T-cell immune response during primary infection."
6034,0.001,1.0000,"Major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are part of the cellular immune response to persistent virus infections. Candidate vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) should elicit broad cross-reactive immunity to confer protection against different strains of HIV-1. As it is likely that candidate vaccines will include the envelope gene product Env, we determined the proportion of CTL clones which recognized variable and conserved determinants in three env variants during natural infection. Limiting dilution analysis was used to characterize numerous short-term CTL clones derived from peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected subjects, using split-well analysis to assay cytotoxicity against target cells expressing gp160env of HIV-1 strains IIIB, MN, and RF. In 9 of 12 HIV-1-infected subjects, at the clonal level most env-specific CTL recognized determinant(s) within one env variant but not in the other variants. In some subjects, CTL recognized multiple nonconserved determinants in different variants. The pattern of recognition of different env variants was relatively stable over time. In most of the patients studied, the proportion of CTL which showed cross-recognition of conserved determinants shared among the three strains was low. Two novel CTL epitopes within gp41 were identified by using 15-mer peptides of the HIV-SF2 sequence. When specific peptide was used to stimulate CTL precursors in vitro, the frequency of peptide-specific CTL precursors was very high, but the CTL elicited by this stimulation were highly strain specific. We conclude that the use of a single HIV env variant to detect CTL activity can underestimate the magnitude and complexity of the env-specific CTL response. The low prevalence of CTL clones which show cross-recognition of conserved determinants may have implications for immunization strategies based solely on env; to elicit broadly cross-reactive CTL other, more conserved viral antigens are likely to be needed in addition to env. Because of its capacity to distinguish CTL responses against different virus strains, limiting dilution analysis is particularly appropriate to quantitate the immune responses generated by candidate env-based vaccines."
9081,0.001,1.0000,"High level adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is required to achieve and maintain suppression of HIV replication. Although directly observed therapy (DOT) has been suggested as an intervention to improve adherence, there is a paucity of data describing the attitudes and beliefs regarding DOT for ART among HIV-infected individuals. This study was designed to evaluate the acceptability and psychometric properties of a survey instrument for use in assessing barriers and facilitators of adherence to ART DOT in prison. From July 1, 1999 to April 1, 2000, we piloted an interviewer-administered questionnaire to assess health beliefs and attitudes regarding HIV treatment among 65 HIV-infected prison inmates receiving one or more of their antiretrovirals via directly observed therapy (DOT). The first 24 participants were administered the questionnaire to determine the feasibility of surveying prisoners in a correctional setting. There were no adherence data collected on these participants. The remaining 41 participants had their adherence measured in addition to receiving the questionnaire. Thirty-one were included in the final analysis because 10 did not complete the study. Multiple antiretroviral adherence measures (electronic device medication monitoring [eDEM] caps, medication administration records [MARs], and pill counts) were assessed among a subset of the participants (n = 31) and correlated to the instrument response items. The median internal consistency reliability coefficient for the multi-item scales was 0.79. The strongest correlation between inmates' beliefs and their adherence was between ""positive beliefs about protease inhibitors"" and the MAR adherence measure (r = 0.72; p < 0.001). This study provides preliminary support for the psychometric properties of the survey in this correctional setting."
7631,0.001,1.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) represents one of the strongest predictors of progression to AIDS, yet it is difficult for most patients to sustain high levels of adherence. This study compares the efficacy of a personalized cell phone reminder system (ARemind) in enhancing adherence to ART versus a beeper. Twenty-three HIV-infected subjects on ART with self-reported adherence less than 85% were randomized to a cellular phone (CP) or beeper (BP). CP subjects received personalized text messages daily; in contrast, BP subjects received a reminder beep at the time of dosing. Interviews were scheduled at weeks 3 and 6. Adherence to ART was measured by self-report (SR, 7-day recall), pill count (PC, past 30 days at baseline, then past 3 weeks), Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS; cumulatively at 3 and 6 weeks), and via a composite adherence score constructed by combining MEMS, pill count, and self report. A mixed effects model adjusting for baseline adherence was used to compare adherence rates between the intervention groups at 3 and 6 weeks. Nineteen subjects completed all visits, 10 men and 9 females. The mean age was 42.7 ± 6.5 years, 37% of subjects were Caucasian and 89% acquired HIV heterosexually. The average adherence to ART was 79% by SR and 65% by PC at baseline in both arms; over 6 weeks adherence increased and remained significantly higher in the ARemind group using multiple measures of adherence. A larger and longer prospective study is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand optimal reminder messages and user fatigue."
2320,0.001,1.0000,"Psychological distress is common among adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) worldwide, and has been associated with non-adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART), leading to poor virologic suppression, drug resistance, and increased risk for AIDS morbidity and mortality. However, only a few studies have explored the relationship between psychological distress and ART adherence among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper examines the relationship between psychological distress and ART adherence, and effect of psychosocial resources on ART adherence. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 464 ALHIV (aged 12-19; 53% female) seeking HIV care at a large HIV treatment center in Kampala, Uganda. ALHIV were recruited during routine clinic visits. Three self-reported binary adherence measures were utilized: missed pills in the past three days, non-adherence to the prescribed medical regimen, and self-rated adherence assessed using a visual analog scale. Psychological distress was measured as a continuous variable, and computed as the mean score on a locally developed and validated 25-item symptom checklist for Ugandan ALHIV. Psychosocial resources included spirituality, religiosity, optimism, social support, and coping strategies. After adjusting for respondents' socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial resources, a unit increase in psychological distress was associated with increased odds of missing pills in past 3 days (Odds Ratio(OR) = 1.75; Confidence Interval (CI): 1.04-2.95), not following the prescribed regimen (OR = 1.63; CI: 1.08-2.46), and lower self-rated adherence (OR = 1.79; CI: 1.19-2.69). Psychosocial resources were associated with lower odds for non-adherence on all three self-report measures. There is a need to strengthen the psychosocial aspects of adolescent HIV care by developing interventions to identify and prevent psychological distress among Ugandan ALHIV."
4308,0.001,1.0000,"Poor micronutrient levels are associated with an increased risk of progression to AIDS and are also suggested to influence outcome of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), though existing data are inconclusive to support the latter. Few published data are available on micronutrient levels in Ethiopian HIV/AIDS patients taking HAART. The objective of the study was to determine the association of micronutrient levels and response to HAART (CD4(+) T cell count) among adult HIV/AIDS patients attending a teaching Hospital in Addis Ababa. CD4(+) T cell counts and micronutrient (retinol, zinc, and iron) levels for 171 subjects were determined using standard procedures. Some proportions of the study participants were found deficient for retinol (14.03 %), zinc (47.3 %), and iron (2.8 %). Patients who were deficient in retinol had a significantly lower median CD4(+) T cell counts (P = 0.002) compared to non-deficient subjects. Association of micronutrient quartiles with CD4+ T cell count was assessed using adjusted multivariate regression by taking quartile 4 as a reference category. Accordingly, patients who had retinol levels in quartile 4 had a significantly lower mean CD4(+) T cell count compared to quartile 3 (P = 0.02). The significantly higher CD4(+) T cell counts in patients who were non-deficient in retinol imply the role of retinol in improving the production of CD4(+) T cells. However, both lower and higher retinol levels were associated with suppressed immunity (CD4 < 200 cells/mm(3)), suggesting an adverse effect of higher retinol levels. Thus, retinol may be potentially harmful depending on the dose, emphasizing the need for optimized level of retinol in nutrient supplements in patients taking HAART."
1247,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related opportunistic infections continue to occur in patients who are newly diagnosed with HIV infection, those in the early course of highly active antiretroviral therapy or nonadherent to HIV care, and other immunosuppressed individuals. One of the most common opportunistic infections in these patients is Pneumocystis pneumonia. CD8+ T cells are recruited to the lung after P. carinii infection and have been associated with both lung injury and host defense. This variability may be due to subpopulations of CD8+ T cells recruited to the lung. We have previously shown using adoptive transfer studies that in vivo-generated T-cytotoxic-1 (Tc1) CD8+ T cells, defined by the secretion of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), have effector activity against Pneumocystis spp. in vitro as well as in vivo. To better understand the mechanisms of these effects, we generated, expanded, and tested Tc1 and Tc2 CD8+ T cells specific for P. murina ex vivo. Tc1-polarized CD8+ T cells secreted higher levels of IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and lower levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 than Tc2 CD8+ T cells when stimulated with P. murina antigen. Moreover, Tc1 CD8+ T cells demonstrated enhanced effector activity in a macrophage-mediated killing assay which was independent of cell contact. The augmentation in macrophage-mediated P. murina killing was significantly abrogated when GM-CSF was neutralized in the Tc1 CD8+ T cells. These data support the possibility that antigen-specific GM-CSF secretion is critical for effector activity of P. murina-specific Tc1 CD8+ T cells in vitro."
8887,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is established by virus variants that use the CCR5 co-receptor for entry (CCR5-tropic or R5 variants), whereas viruses that use CXCR4 as co-receptor (CXCR4-tropic or X4 variants) emerge during disease progression in approximately 50 % of infected subjects. X4 variants may have a higher fitness ex vivo and their detection is usually accompanied by faster T-cell depletion and the onset of AIDS in HIV-1-positive individuals. Here, the relationship between the sequence variation of the HIV-1 env V3-V5 region and positive selective pressure on R5 and X4 variants from infected subjects with CD4 T cell counts below 200 cells microl(-1) was studied. A correlation was found between genetic distance and CD4(+) cell count at late stages of the disease. R5 variants that co-existed with X4 variants were significantly less heterogeneous than R5 variants from subjects without X4 variants (P < 0.0001). Similarly, X4 variants had a significantly higher diversity than R5 variants (P < 0.0001), although residues under positive selection had a similar distribution pattern in both variants. Therefore, both X4 and R5 variants were subjected to high selective pressures from the host. Furthermore, the interaction between X4 and R5 variants within the same subject resulted in a purifying selection on R5 variants, which only survived as a homogeneous virus population. These results indicate that R5 variants from X4 phenotype samples were highly homogeneous and under weakly positive selective pressures. In contrast, R5 variants from R5 phenotype samples were highly heterogeneous and subject to positive selective pressures."
7926,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects target cells by binding to CD4 and a chemokine receptor, most commonly CCR5. CXCR4 is a frequent alternative coreceptor (CoR) in subtype B and D HIV-1 infection, but the importance of many other alternative CoRs remains elusive. We have analyzed HIV-1 envelope (Env) proteins from 66 individuals infected with the major subtypes of HIV-1 to determine if virus entry into highly permissive NP-2 cell lines expressing most known alternative CoRs differed by HIV-1 subtype. We also performed linear regression analysis to determine if virus entry via the major CoR CCR5 correlated with use of any alternative CoR and if this correlation differed by subtype. Virus pseudotyped with subtype B Env showed robust entry via CCR3 that was highly correlated with CCR5 entry efficiency. By contrast, viruses pseudotyped with subtype A and C Env proteins were able to use the recently described alternative CoR FPRL1 more efficiently than CCR3, and use of FPRL1 was correlated with CCR5 entry. Subtype D Env was unable to use either CCR3 or FPRL1 efficiently, a unique pattern of alternative CoR use. These results suggest that each subtype of circulating HIV-1 may be subject to somewhat different selective pressures for Env-mediated entry into target cells and suggest that CCR3 may be used as a surrogate CoR by subtype B while FPRL1 may be used as a surrogate CoR by subtypes A and C. These data may provide insight into development of resistance to CCR5-targeted entry inhibitors and alternative entry pathways for each HIV-1 subtype."
7503,0.001,1.0000,"Unlike HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which induce a slow, unrelenting loss of immune function spanning several years, highly pathogenic simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) induce a rapid, complete, and irreversible depletion of CD4(+) T lymphocytes in rhesus monkeys within weeks of infection, leading to death from immunodeficiency. We recently reported that, because these SHIVs exclusively use the CXCR4 coreceptor for cell entry, they target naive CD4(+) T cells for depletion in infected monkeys, whereas SIVs, which use CCR5, not CXCR4, cause the selective loss of memory CD4(+) T lymphocytes in vivo. Here we show both by DNA PCR analyses and infectivity assays, using live sorted CD4(+) T lymphocyte subsets, that 30-90% of circulating naive cells were productively infected by day 10 after inoculation. This result implies that direct cell killing, not bystander apoptosis, is responsible for the massive loss of CD4(+) T cells in the X4-tropic SHIV model. Furthermore, we directly demonstrate that >96% of virus producing cells did not express the Ki-67 proliferation marker on day 10 after inoculation using confocal microscopic analysis of lymph nodes samples. This finding is consistent with the prodigious levels of plasma viremia measured during acute X4-tropic SHIV infections of macaques being generated almost entirely by resting naive CD4(+) T cells."
1084,0.001,1.0000,"The natural ligands for the CCR5 chemokine receptor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), MIP-1beta, and RANTES (regulated on T-cell activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted), are known to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry, and N-terminally modified RANTES analogues are more potent than native RANTES in blocking infection. However, potent CCR5 blocking agents may select for HIV-1 variants that use alternative coreceptors at less than fully inhibitory concentrations. In this study, two N-terminal chemical modifications of RANTES produced by total synthesis, aminooxypentane (AOP)-RANTES[2-68] and N-nonanoyl (NNY)-RANTES[2-68], were tested for their ability to prevent HIV-1 infection and to select for coreceptor switch variants in the human peripheral blood lymphocyte-SCID mouse model. Mice were infected with a CCR5-using HIV-1 isolate that requires only one or two amino acid substitutions to use CXCR4 as a coreceptor. Even though it achieved lower circulating concentrations than AOP-RANTES (75 to 96 pM as opposed to 460 pM under our experimental conditions), NNY-RANTES was more effective in preventing HIV-1 infection. However, in a subset of treated mice, these levels of NNY-RANTES rapidly selected viruses with mutations in the V3 loop of envelope that altered coreceptor usage. These results reinforce the case for using agents that block all significant HIV-1 coreceptors for effective therapy."
4508,0.001,1.0000,"Viral persistence is associated with hierarchical antiviral CD8 T cell exhaustion with increased programmed death-1 (PD-1) expression. In HCV persistence, HCV-specific CD8 T cells from the liver (the site of viral replication) display increased PD-1 expression and a profound functional impairment that is not reversed by PD-1 blockade alone. Here, we report that the inhibitory receptor cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is preferentially upregulated in PD-1(+) T cells from the liver but not blood of chronically HCV-infected patients. PD-1/CTLA-4 co-expression in intrahepatic T cells was associated with a profound HCV-specific effector dysfunction that was synergistically reversed by combined PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade in vitro, but not by blocking PD-1 or CTLA-4 alone. A similar effect was observed in circulating HCV-specific CD8 T cells with increased PD-1/CTLA-4 co-expression during acute hepatitis C. The functional response to combined blockade was directly associated with CTLA-4 expression, lost with CD28-depletion and CD4-independent (including CD4(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs). We conclude that PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways both contribute to virus-specific T cell exhaustion at the site of viral replication by a redundant mechanism that requires combined PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade to reverse. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of virus-specific T cell dysfunction, and suggest that the synergistic effect by combined inhibitory receptor blockade might have a therapeutic application against chronic viral infection in vivo, provided that it does not induce autoimmunity."
7708,0.001,1.0000,"Current understanding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcription is based on unidirectional expression of transcripts with positive-strand polarity from the 5' long terminal repeat. We now report HIV-1 transcripts with negative-strand polarity obtained from acutely and chronically infected cell lines by use of a template orientation-specific reverse transcriptase-PCR assay. These findings were confirmed in natural infection by analysis of RNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 15 HIV-1-infected patients. A cDNA derived from a 2.3-kb polyadenylated HIV-1 RNA with negative-strand polarity which encodes a highly conserved 189-amino-acid open reading frame antiparallel to the envelope gene was isolated from acutely infected A3.01 cells. Through use of reporter gene constructions, we further found that a novel negative-strand promoter functions within the negative response element of the 3' long terminal repeat, which is downregulated by coexpression of Tat. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that NF-kappa B I and USF sites are crucial for negative-strand promoter activity. These data extend the coding capacity of HIV-1 and suggest a role for antisense regulation of the viral life cycle."
1980,0.001,1.0000,"CD14, originally recognized as a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor, has recently been implicated in the process of T-cell suppression and apoptosis. Its soluble form has been shown to bind, in vitro, to human T cells, a process that may carry a negative signal onto these cells. We recently described a novel lymphocyte population in human peripheral blood, a population that expresses an intracellular CD14-like antigen. This novel T-cell population, composed mainly of CD8 cells and of very few CD4 cells, was found to be greatly enhanced in asymptomatic, untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals. In the present study, we further characterized this cell population and found that it differed from other CD8 subpopulations associated with HIV infection such as CD8/CD38. In addition, we followed HIV patients under conditions of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and observed two groups of patients: patients in whom the CD14-like positive-testing T cells returned to normal within 1 to 3 months, and patients in whom it did not, in spite of a significant plasma HIV-RNA viral load decrease. Thus, this new CD14-like positive-testing lymphocyte population may represent an interesting and important component of the cellular events associated with HIV infection. On the basis of its modulation following HAART, we speculate that it may be used, in the future, as a drug-monitoring cellular marker in antiretroviral treatment."

However, there is no standardized set of antigens in general use, which could lead to conflicting results. We have previously shown that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients with prior Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP+) responded more frequently and more strongly to a clone of MsgC than did HIV-1-infected patients without PcP (PcP-). Here we test three new clones of MsgC to determine the effect of antigenic sequence variation on immune reactivity in blood donors and HIV-infected patients previously analyzed for reactivity to our original MsgC clone. In Western blot analyses, PcP+ patients exhibited the highest frequency of reactivity to each MsgC clone, and the frequency of reactivity with all four MsgC clones together was significantly higher in sera from PcP+ patients than in sera from the other patient groups. Furthermore, in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we found that the PcP+ population had the highest level of reactivity to two of the four clones tested. One of the new clones could distinguish between PcP+ and PcP- populations, and two MsgC clones could distinguish blood donors from the other patient populations. The results show that inherent differences in MsgC amino acid sequence can affect recognition by antibodies independently of variations in protein length or patient population, and the utility of a clone depends on its sequence and on the populations tested."
4011,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains the most common risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Efficient suppression of HBV viremia and necroinflammation as a result of nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment is able to reduce HCC incidence; nevertheless, hepatocarcinogenesis can occur in the absence of active hepatitis, correlating with high HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) levels. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a central player in chronic inflammation and HCC development. However, in the absence of severe chronic inflammation, the role of NF-κB signaling in HCC development remains elusive. As a model of hepatocarcinogenesis driven by accumulation of HBV envelope polypeptides, HBsAg transgenic mice, which show no HBV-specific immune response, were crossed to animals with hepatocyte-specific inhibition of canonical NF-κB signaling. We detected prolonged, severe endoplasmic reticulum stress already at 20 weeks of age in NF-κB-deficient hepatocytes of HBsAg-expressing mice. The unfolded protein response regulator binding immunoglobulin protein/78-kDa glucose-regulated protein was down-regulated, activating transcription factor 6, and eIF2α were activated with subsequent overexpression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein. Notably, immune cell infiltrates and liver transaminases were unchanged. However, as a result of this increased cellular stress, insufficient hepatocyte proliferation due to G1 /S-phase cell cycle arrest with overexpression of p27 and emergence of ductular reactions was detected. This culminated in increased DNA damage already at 20 weeks of age and finally led to 100% HCC incidence due to NF-κB inhibition."
7914,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated liver diseases. However, whether HBx has the ability to disturb the susceptibility of hepatocytes to common chemotherapeutic agents remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that HBx enhances cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity by a mechanism involving degradation of Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Ectopic expression of HBx sensitized hepatocytes to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, which was accompanied by a marked downregulation of Mcl-1 but not of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Overexpression of Mcl-1 prevented HBx-induced proapoptotic and proinflammatory effects during cisplatin treatment both in vitro and in vivo. HBx-induced dysregulation of Mcl-1 resulted mainly from posttranslational degradation rather than transcription repression. Moreover, a caspase-3 inhibitor effectively abrogated HBx-enhanced Mcl-1 degradation and cell death. Importantly, antioxidants blocked activation of caspase-3 and acceleration of Mcl-1 loss, as well as cell death, in HBx-expressing hepatocytes upon cisplatin exposure in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these data implicate oxidative stress-dependent caspase-3-mediated degradation of Mcl-1 as a mechanism contributing to HBx-mediated sensitization of cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity. A combination of cisplatin and antioxidants might provide more advantage than cisplatin alone in the treatment of cancer patients with chronic HBV infection."
2915,0.001,1.0000,"Treatment with exogenous interferon (IFN)-α is not effective in the majority of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Recent evidence suggests that HBV has evolved strategies to block the nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 to limit IFN-α-induced cellular antiviral responses. However, it remains unclear whether STAT1 translocation is impaired in chronic hepatitis B patients and what mechanisms are involved. Here we report that the expression of HBV polymerase (Pol) in human hepatic cell lines inhibited induction of IFN-stimulated genes and resulted in a weakened antiviral activity of IFN-α. Ectopic expression of Pol suppressed IFN-α-induced STAT1 serine 727 phosphorylation and STAT1/2 nuclear accumulation, whereas STAT1 tyrosine 701 phosphorylation, and STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer formation were not affected. Further studies demonstrated that Pol interacted with the catalytic domain of protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ) and perturbed PKC-δ phosphorylation and its association with STAT1, which resulted in the suppression of STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation. Moreover, Pol was found to interfere with nuclear transportation of STAT1/2 by competitively binding to the region of importin-α5 required for STAT1/2 recruitment. Truncation analysis suggested that the terminal protein and RNase H domains of Pol were able to bind to PKC-δ and importin-α5, respectively, and were responsible for the inhibition of IFN-α signaling. More importantly, the inhibition of STAT1 and PKC-δ phosphorylation were confirmed in a hydrodynamic-based HBV mouse model, and the blockage of IFN-α-induced STAT1/2 nuclear translocation was observed in HBV-infected cells from liver biopsies of chronic HBV patients."

We assessed PDR prevalence, patterns, and trends in Guatemala. Blood samples from 1,084 ART-naive individuals, enrolled from October 2010 to December 2013 at the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala City, were obtained. PDR was evaluated using the WHO mutation list for transmitted drug resistance (TDR) surveillance. An overall PDR prevalence of 7.3% (95% CI 5.8-9.0%) was observed for the whole study period. TDR to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) was the highest (4.9%, p<0.001), followed by nucleoside RT inhibitors (1.8%) and protease inhibitors (1.0%). No significant trends in PDR prevalence were observed during the study period. However, higher NNRTI PDR levels were found in individuals with >500 and 350-500 CD4(+) T cells/μl (7.4% and 8.7%, respectively) compared to individuals with <350 CD4(+) T cells/μl (3.7%; p=0.039 and p=0.007, respectively), as well as a tendency of higher levels of NNRTI transmitted drug resistance (DR) in individuals with recent infection determined by HIV incidence tests (9.7%), suggesting increasing trends in time. Clusters of viruses with NNRTI PDR suggesting complex transmission networks were observed. No associations between PDR and demographic variables were found. PDR in Guatemala remains at an intermediate level. Nevertheless, we have shown evidence suggesting increasing trends in NNRTI PDR, which need to be taken into account in national HIV management policies."
4757,0.001,1.0000,"The impact of drug resistance mutations induced by nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NRTI) on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) recognition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain LAI (HIV-1(LAI)) RT was addressed in 35 treated or untreated patients. Two HIV-1(LAI) RT regions encompassing mutation M41L, L74V, M184V, and T215Y/F were recognized in 75 and 83% mutated and in 33 and 42% unmutated samples, respectively. A total of 41 new CTL epitopes overlapping these mutations were predicted. Mutations enhanced HLA-binding scores of 17 epitopes, decreased scores of 5, and had no effect in 19. Four predicted epitopes containing mutations 41, 74, and 184 were tested and recognized by CD8 cells from mutated or unmutated samples, with frequencies up to 270 gamma interferon spot-forming cells per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Therefore, RT mutations induced by NRTI can increase the immunogenicity of RT for CTL and might allow a better immune control of resistant viruses in vivo, suggesting that specific immune therapy might help prevent these mutations."
6384,0.001,1.0000,"Z-100 is an arabinomannan extracted from Mycobacterium tuberculosis that has various immunomodulatory activities, such as the induction of interleukin 12, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and beta-chemokines. The effects of Z-100 on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) are investigated in this paper. In MDMs, Z-100 markedly suppressed the replication of not only macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 strain (HIV-1JR-CSF), but also HIV-1 pseudotypes that possessed amphotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus G envelopes. Z-100 was found to inhibit HIV-1 expression, even when added 24 h after infection. In addition, it substantially inhibited the expression of the pNL43lucDeltaenv vector (in which the env gene is defective and the nef gene is replaced with the firefly luciferase gene) when this vector was transfected directly into MDMs. These findings suggest that Z-100 inhibits virus replication, mainly at HIV-1 transcription. However, Z-100 also downregulated expression of the cell surface receptors CD4 and CCR5 in MDMs, suggesting some inhibitory effect on HIV-1 entry. Further experiments revealed that Z-100 induced IFN-beta production in these cells, resulting in induction of the 16-kDa CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) beta transcription factor that represses HIV-1 long terminal repeat transcription. These effects were alleviated by SB 203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), indicating that the p38 MAPK signalling pathway was involved in Z-100-induced repression of HIV-1 replication in MDMs. These findings suggest that Z-100 might be a useful immunomodulator for control of HIV-1 infection."
2249,0.001,1.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus (OBI) in HIV-infected groups is still debated, as well as the associated risk-factors and clinical significance. In this paper, we examined a total of 405 HBsAg-negative/HIV-infected patients enrolled from January 2007 to December 2009. Overall, the prevalence of OBI was 5.9% (95% confidence interval (CI(₉₅%): 3.8-8.7%); it was more frequently associated with ""anti-HBc alone"" serological marker (11.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 3.7, CI(₉₅%): 1.4-9.8), although it was also detected in the absence of any HBV serological marker (4.9%; CI(₉₅%): 2.3-9.1%). A low prevalence of anti-HCV-positive patients with OBI was found (3.1%; CI(₉₅%): 0.6-8.7%). HIV RNA plasma levels or other immunological/clinical characteristics were not significantly associated with OBI. All but one occult HBV infections were sustained by genotype D viral strains. OBI is relatively frequent in HIV-infected patients, although it does not seem to exert a relevant clinical impact. Viral genotypes in occult HBV infections reflect those circulating in the Mediterranean area."
4291,0.001,1.0000,"This paper describes a comprehensive study of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genotype sensitivity of the transcription-mediated amplification (TMA)-based HIV-1/HCV assay, developed and manufactured by Gen-Probe Incorporated (San Diego, CA) for screening human plasma specimens in blood bank settings. The TMA HIV-1/HCV assay is a qualitative, in vitro nucleic acid testing system used for initial screening. HIV-1 and HCV discriminatory assays are used to distinguish between HIV-1 and HCV infection or co-infection. In this study, multiple unique specimens representing HCV genotypes 1-6 were tested at various dilutions. The results show that the TMA HIV-1/HCV assay and the TMA HCV discriminatory assay have similar HCV genotype sensitivity, as both assays detected all six genotypes at 100 copies/ml and nearly all replicates tested at 30 copies/ml. Similarly, numerous unique specimens representing HIV-1 group M subtypes (A-G), HIV-1 group N, and group O specimens were tested at various dilutions. The TMA HIV-1/HCV assay and the TMA HIV-1 discriminatory assay were found to have similar HIV-1 subtype sensitivity; all variants at 100 copies/ml and nearly all at 30 copies/ml were detected. These results indicate that the TMA assays meet the sensitivity requirements for blood screening in blood banks worldwide."
2930,0.001,1.0000,"Infection of macrophages (M/M) by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a main pathogenetic event leading to neuronal dysfunction and death in patients with AIDS dementia complex. Alteration of viability of neurons and astrocytes occurs in vivo even without their infection, thus it is conceivable that HIV-infected M/M may affect viability of such cells even without direct infection. To assess this hypothesis, we studied the effects of HIV-infected M/M on an astrocytic cell-line lacking CD4-receptor expression. Exposure to supernatants of HIV-infected M/M triggers complete disruption and apoptotic death of astrocytic cells. This effect is not related to HIV transmission from infected M/M, because HIV-DNA and p24 production in astrocytic cells remained negative. Apoptotic death of astrocytes is mainly mediated by Fas ligand released in supernatants of HIV-infected M/M (as demonstrated by complete reversal of such phenomenon by adding neutralizing antibodies against CD95 receptor). Treatment of astrocytic cells with recombinant (biologically active) Tat induces < 10% apoptosis, and gp120 was totally ineffective. Treatment of HIV-infected M/M with AZT completely reverses the proapoptotic effect of their supernatants on astrocytes, thus demonstrating that productive virus replication within M/M is required for the induction of astrocytic cell death. Taken together, data suggest that homeostasis of astrocytes may be affected by HIV-infected M/M in the absence of productive infection of target cells. This phenomenon may help to explain the cellular damage found in HIV-infected patients also in areas of the brain not strictly adjacent to HIV-infected M/M."
2040,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B and C continue to be major public health problems in France, particularly among migrants. The fact of being born in hepatitis B and C-endemic countries or of being a long-term resident of these countries are common risk factors, especially in the case of hepatitis B. Screening for both types of infection remains low among migrants. The main purpose of this study was to examine perceptions of the risk of viral hepatitis B and C in migrants among health professionals in Côte-d'Or (Burgundy, France) and to understand the factors promoting or hindering screening. The paper presents the results of a qualitative study based on face-to-face interviews with 23 healthcare providers and 8 social workers. The participating health professionals were interviewed about their involvement in the fight against hepatitis B and C and their perceptions of the risk of infection among migrants. The interviews conducted with social workers focused mostly on the conditions of social and health support provided to migrants. The study found that hepatitis B and C screening among migrants was associated with HIV screening. Screening was found to be associated with formalities relating to the legal and administrative status of migrants, the type of accommodation or housing, health professionals' knowledge of the risk factors associated with the epidemiological and social/health context in the countries of origin, and their own involvement in humanitarian aid. Migrants seeking political asylum and living in reception centers were found to be more likely to undergo screening. The findings suggest that awareness of the importance of systematic screening for hepatitis B and C in migrants from hepatitis B and C-endemic areas needs to be promoted among social workers and health professionals, as recommended by the National Prevention and Control Program (2009-2012)."
6419,0.001,1.0000,"Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) at mucosal surfaces and appears to play an important role in the dissemination of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. DC-SIGN binds HIV-1 gp120 and efficiently transmits the virus to T CD4(+) cells, which become the center of viral replication. Semen represents the main vector for HIV-1 dissemination worldwide. In the present study we show that human seminal plasma (SP), even when used at very high dilutions (1:10(4) to 1:10(5)), markedly inhibits the capture and transmission of HIV-1 to T CD4(+) cells mediated by both DCs and B-THP-1-DC-SIGN cells. In contrast, SP does not inhibit the capture of HIV-1 by DC-SIGN-negative target cells, such as the T-cell line SupT-1, monocytes, and activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The SP inhibitor has a high molecular mass (>100 kDa) and directly interacts with DC-SIGN-positive target cells but not with HIV-1. Moreover, the inhibitor binds to concanavalin A, suggesting that it contains high-mannose N-linked carbohydrates. Of note, using biotin-labeled SP we found that the binding of SP components to DCs was abrogated by mannan, while their interaction with B-THP-1 cells was almost completely dependent on the expression of DC-SIGN. Since epithelium integrity is often compromised after vaginal or anal intercourse, as well as in the presence of ulcerative-sexually transmitted diseases, our results support the notion that components of the SP might be able to access to the subepithelium, inhibiting the recognition of HIV-1 gp120 by DC-SIGN-positive DCs."
4240,0.001,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral treatment is compromised by viral resistance mutations. Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is therefore monitored closely, but follow-up studies of these patients are limited. Virus from 1405 individuals diagnosed with HIV-1 in Denmark between 2001 and 2009 was analyzed for TDR, and molecular-epidemiological links and progression of the infection were described based on data from standardized questionnaires, the prospective Danish HIV Cohort Study, and by phylogenetic analysis. Eighty-five individuals were found to be infected with virus harboring mutations resulting in a prevalence of 6.1%, with no changes over time. The main resistance mutations were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation 215 revertants, as well as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation 103N/S and protease inhibitor (PI) mutations 90M and 85V. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed 12 transmission chains involving 37 TDR individuals. Of these 21 were also documented epidemiologically. The virus included in the transmission chain carried similar resistance mutations to the TDR index case, whereas controls chains from index cases without TDR were generally without resistance mutations. We observed no difference in progression of the infection between individuals infected with TDR and individuals infected with wild-type HIV-1. The prevalence of TDR is low in Denmark and transmission of dual-drug-resistant HIV-1 is infrequent. The TDR isolates were shown to originate from local patients failing therapy."
1305,0.001,1.0000,"To explore the biologic significance of the presence of a heterogeneous human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population within infected individuals with regard to ultimate disease progression, the effect of coinfection of more than one variant of HIV on infectivity and cytopathogenicity in CD4-positive cells was examined. Using the lowest and highest infectious clones of HIV obtained by the plaque-cloning method, a clear consistent synergism of infectivity and cytopathic effects was detected when different cell lines were coinfected with a mixture of the two clones. These data suggest that the emergence of a highly infectious variant of HIV due to mutation may modify the infectivity of a minimally infectious latent variant with the final progression of HIV infection to overt AIDS."
8595,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus infection of a human bone derived cell line was initiated by either cell free virus or with a cell to cell transmission method. The human bone derived cells were examined for 8 weeks, and virus infection was not detected when assessed by microscopy, immunofluorescence, reverse transcriptase activity, or infection of cocultivated human T lymphoid cells susceptible to human immunodeficiency virus. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of human bone derived cells inoculated with the cell to cell infection format showed less than 0.1% infected cells. It is possible that the infected cells detected by polymerase chain reaction were lymphocytes used in the cell to cell infection format. Alternatively, latent infection may have been established in the bone derived cells with no apparent expression of the proviral genome. A large proportion of bone is represented by human bone derived cells, and it is unlikely that bone will contribute to a significant human immunodeficiency virus reservoir in vivo. The blood of bone allograft donors is likely to have a greater virus bioburden than is bone. Methods to sterilize bone should be assessed by their efficacy to inactivate the virus in blood contaminating the graft, and methods to detect human immunodeficiency virus deoxyribonucleic acid in a bone graft may be less sensitive than examining the donor's blood."
9090,0.001,1.0000,"A synthetic peptide, RPI 312, that specifically inhibits the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) showed a potent inhibition on virus production, maturation, and infectivity. Treatment with this agent prevented the cleavage of Gag protein at the site between p17 and p24 in HIV-1 chronically infected MOLT-4 cells as well as in the released virus. Passage of HIV-1 in the presence of gradually increasing concentrations of this protease inhibitor resulted in emergence of a variant that could evade the drug effects. In the resistant variant the maturation of Gag proteins appeared normal, but its infectivity was reduced compared with that of the parent virus. The nucleotides coding the amino acids at and around the cleavage site between Gag proteins p17 and p24 were not changed. One point mutation (A-->G) at site 2082 of the pol gene that resulted in one amino acid change at site 84 of the protease from isoleucine to valine (I-84-->V) could be detected in the resistant variant. An HIV-1 infectious DNA clone with the I-84-->V mutation also showed reduced sensitivity to this protease inhibitor. The findings that the resistant variant had lower infectivity and was still affected by higher doses of the drug support the speculation that resistance to protease inhibitors may not be as problematic as other drug resistance."
6465,0.001,1.0000,"Host genetic traits impact susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, disease progression as well as antiretroviral drug pharmacokinetics and toxicity. Remarkable examples include a 32-bp deletion in the CCR5 coreceptor molecule (CCR5-delta32) impairing attachment of monocytotropic HIV-1 to the host cell membrane and the HLA-B*5701 allele, strongly associated with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction triggered by abacavir, a nucleoside inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase. We developed a simple selective multiplex endpoint PCR method for simultaneous analysis of both genetic traits. Two primers were designed for amplification of a region surrounding the CCR5 32-bp deletion site. One common forward primer and two reverse primers with different 3' termini targeting the HLA-B*570101 and HLA-B*570102 alleles were designed for HLA-B*5701 analysis. A panel of 110 reference DNA samples typed in the HLA-B locus was used for development and blind validation of the assay. All the 45 HLA-B*5701 positive and the 55 HLA-B*5701 negative samples were correctly identified. The CCR5-delta32 allele was readily detected in 7 samples and did not interfere with detection of HLA-B*5701 while providing an internal amplification control. Multiplex PCR products were easily identified in agarose gels with no background noise. This simple and low-cost end-point selective multiplex PCR can conveniently screen HIV patients for the protective CCR5-delta32 allele and the risk of developing abacavir hypersensitivity reaction. "
6982,0.001,1.0000,"This study demonstrates the transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) from infected queens to kittens in two separate litters. Queen 1 was infected by intravenous administration of FIV at 22 days prior to parturition. Two out of three kittens from the litter were found to be viremic at 10 weeks of age as detected by culture isolation and polymerase chain reaction detection of FIV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes. The third kitten remained aviremic through 40 weeks of age. Queen 2 was infected by subcutaneous administration of FIV 2 days prior to parturition. This litter also had two out of three kittens infected with FIV; however, viremia was not detected in one of the kittens until 21 weeks of age. Culture isolation was found to be superior to polymerase chain reaction for the early detection of FIV, and viremia was found to precede seroconversion by up to 4 weeks. Although all infected kittens have remained healthy, depressed CD4:CD8 lymphocyte ratios suggest that clinical disease may develop. This study suggests that FIV infection in cats may be a useful model system for the study of HIV transmission from mothers to infants."
4331,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) coinfect many individuals in North America and in parts of Africa. Infection with HIV is a leading risk factor for the development of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HIV infection of common or adjacent cells would stimulate replication and spread of KSHV. Infection of a primary effusion lymphoma cell line by vesicular stomatitis virus type G-pseudotyped HIV type 1 led to a rapid induction of lytic-phase KSHV replication. Induction of lytic KSHV replication by HIV required active replication of HIV. The addition of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine or the protease inhibitor indinavir to the culture prevented HIV spread and inhibited the associated induction of KSHV lytic replication. Lytic replication occurred in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected cells within the culture, and could be induced in uninfected cells via a soluble factor released from the HIV-infected cells. Transmission of infectious KSHV to an uninfected target cell was enhanced by HIV replication and was inhibited by antiretroviral drugs. These results may have implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of KS in individuals coinfected with KSHV and HIV."

Only 13 cases of vesical carcinoma have been reported to date in the setting of HIV infection, but only 3 anecdotal single reports (the last in the y 2001) described clinical, therapeutic, and outcome issues of this rare disease association in some detail. In our patients, micro- or macro-haematuria was the clue for in-depth diagnosis and prompt treatment, which was limited to multiple local interventions in 1 case, but finally required a radical cystectomy in the second patient. No relationship was found with the very favourable underlying HIV-related virological and immunological status, and the present 8-12-month follow-up did not show disease relapses."

There is clinical overlap of both diseases, including symptoms, pulmonary function abnormalities, and lymphocyte function. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in these patients showed a lymphocytic alveolitis without pathogens. BAL lymphocyte subset analysis showed markedly depressed CD4+/CD8+ ratios in three patients. These data were clinically useful for distinguishing the CD8+ alveolitis associated with HIV infection from the CD4+ alveolitis associated with sarcoidosis. Three patients improved with corticosteroid therapy. Two patients with BAL-documented CD8+ alveolitis tolerated discontinuation of steroids. One patient's sarcoidosis improved without therapy concurrent with the diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma. Another patient developed sarcoidosis 1 yr after manifesting HIV positive serology. BAL can be used to distinguish the lymphocytic alveolitis of sarcoidosis from that associated with HIV infection. Patients with active sarcoidosis complicated by HIV infection can be effectively treated with corticosteroid therapy."

We aimed to describe the hospital-level disease burden and factors contributing to morbidity and mortality among hospitalized HIV-positive patients in the era of widespread ART availability. Between June 2012 and October 2013, unselected patients admitted to medical wards at a public sector district hospital in Cape Town were enrolled in this cross-sectional study with prospective follow-up. HIV testing was systematically offered and HIV-infected patients were systematically screened for TB. The spectrum of admission diagnoses among HIV-positive patients was documented, vital status at 90 and 180 days ascertained and factors independently associated with death determined. Among 1018 medical admissions, HIV status was ascertained in 99.5%: 60.1% (n = 609) were HIV-positive and 96.1% (n = 585) were enrolled. Of these, 84.4% were aware of their HIV-positive status before admission. ART status was naive in 35.7%, current in 45.0%, and interrupted in 19.3%. The most frequent primary clinical diagnoses were newly diagnosed TB (n = 196, 33.5%), other bacterial infection (n = 100, 17.1%), and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illnesses other than TB (n = 64, 10.9%). By 90 days follow-up, 175 (29.9%) required readmission and 78 (13.3%) died. Commonest causes of death were TB (37.2%) and other AIDS-defining illnesses (24.4%). Independent predictors of mortality were AIDS-defining illnesses other than TB, low hemoglobin, and impaired renal function. HIV still accounts for nearly two-thirds of medical admissions in this South African hospital and is associated with high mortality. Strategies to improve linkage to care, ART adherence/retention and TB prevention are key to reducing HIV-related hospitalizations in this setting."

Among the 5730 HIV-seropositive in- and out-patients, 123 (2.1 per cent) had TB (121 infections caused by M. tuberculosis, 2 by M. bovis). Tuberculosis was pulmonary in 53 patients (43.1 per cent), extrapulmonary in 36 patients (29.3 per cent), and combined in 34 patients (27.6 per cent). There was no statistically significant difference among these three locations as to the mean CD4 count/mm3 (160 +/- 17), the type of antituberculosis therapy, the length of treatment (10.8 +/- 0.6 months) and the outcome. Fifty-two (45.2 per cent) patients received an initial antituberculosis therapeutic regimen of four drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide; 54 (46.9 per cent) were started on three drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol; and nine (7.8 per cent) received a two-drug combination: isoniazid, rifampicin. Fourteen of 75 patients subsequently received secondary preventive therapy. The mean follow-up time was 252 +/- 290 days. Clinical healing was obtained in 57.7 per cent of patients. Forty-six patients died, 33 during treatment: 23 from AIDS and eight from TB (in the first 3 weeks of treatment). Five patients suffered from relapses due to poor treatment compliance.

9815,0.001,1.0000,"The major causative agent for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 is a predominant subtype of HIV which counts on human cellular mechanism virtually in every aspect of its life cycle. Binding of viral envelope glycoprotein-gp120 with human cell surface CD4 receptor triggers the early infection stage of HIV-1. This study focuses on the interaction interface between these two proteins that play a crucial role for viral infectivity. The CD4-gp120 interaction interface has been studied through a comprehensive protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) analysis and highlighted as a useful step towards identifying potential therapeutic drug targets against HIV-1 infection. We prioritized gp41, Nef and Tat proteins of HIV-1 as valuable drug targets at early stage of viral infection. Lack of crystal structure has made it difficult to understand the biological implication of these proteins during disease progression. Here, computational protein modeling techniques and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to generate three-dimensional models of these targets. Besides, molecular docking was initiated to determine the desirability of these target proteins for already available HIV-1 specific drugs which indicates the usefulness of these protein structures to identify an effective drug combination therapy against AIDS."
3947,0.001,1.0000,"Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection can cause a severe lethal hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. CD8(+) T cells play a critical role in combating HTNV infections. However, the contributions of different CD8(+) T cell subsets to the immune response against viral infection are poorly understood. Here, we identified a novel subset of CD8(+) T cells characterized by the CD8(low) CD100(-) phenotype in HFRS patients. The CD8(low) CD100(-) subset accounted for a median of 14.3% of the total CD8(+) T cells in early phase of HFRS, and this percentage subsequently declined in the late phase of infection, whereas this subset was absent in healthy controls. Furthermore, the CD8(low) CD100(-) cells were associated with high activation and expressed high levels of cytolytic effector molecules and exhibited a distinct expression profile of effector CD8(+) T cells (CCR7(+/-) CD45RA(-) CD127(high) CD27(int) CD28(low) CD62L(-)). When stimulated with specific HTNV nucleocapsid protein-derived peptide pools, most responding CD8(+) cells (gamma interferon [IFN-γ] positive and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α] positive) were CD8(low) CD100(-) cells. The frequency of CD8(low) CD100(-) cells among HTNV-specific CD8(+) T cells was higher in milder cases than in more severe cases. Importantly, the proportion of the CD8(low) CD100(-) subset among CD8(+) T cells in early phase of HFRS was negatively correlated with the HTNV viral load, suggesting that CD8(low) CD100(-) cells may be associated with viral clearance. The contraction of the CD8(low) CD100(-) subset in late phase of infection may be related to the consistently high expression levels of PD-1. These results may provide new insights into our understanding of CD8(+) T cell-mediated protective immunity as well as immune homeostasis after HTNV infection in humans."

A study was undertaken to evaluate SLPI levels in human saliva and plasma among HIV-positive (HIV(+)) patients with various HIV-1 viral loads in comparison to uninfected controls. Whole blood in EDTA and unstimulated saliva samples were collected from 37 HIV(+) patients, of whom 20 had a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA). Control samples were collected from 20 appropriate age- and sex-matched HIV-1-negative individuals. SLPI was estimated from both saliva and serum samples by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HIV viral load was determined using a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. SLPI levels were increased 16.7% in plasma and 10.3% in saliva among HIV(+) patients in comparison to uninfected controls. SLPI levels were increased 5.9% in saliva and 3.9% in plasma among HIV(+) patients with a high viral load (>10,000 copies/ml) as compared to patients with a low viral load (<400 copies/ml). Only 23% of patients with a high viral load used combination therapy with protease inhibitor drugs, whereas 92.9% of HIV(+) patients with a low viral load used protease inhibitors. SLPI levels did not differ significantly among the IVDA patients, patients with different viral loads, or patients using protease inhibitor drugs. There was a statistically significant increase in SLPI levels in saliva among HIV patients in comparison to non-HIV-infected controls. An increase in SLPI levels among HIV(+) patients may be a natural consequence of HIV pathogenesis and an important factor in preventing oral transmission of HIV, but this increase may not be evident during plasma viremia in patients with a high viral load."

All subjects were interviewed regarding their sexual practices and tested for HIV type 1. Fifty-seven of the 187 sexual partners were infected with HIV type 1. The strongest risk factor for HIV type 1 infection among these partners was unprotected receptive anal intercourse with a known HIV type 1-infected index subject (odds ratio (OR) = 7.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.1-16.3). The risk of unprotected receptive anal intercourse was highest among partners of HIV-infected index subjects who had a T lymphocyte subset ratio of 0.50 or less (OR = 11.4, 95% CI 3.0-43.5) compared with partners of HIV type 1-infected index subjects with a T cell ratio of greater than 0.50 (OR = 5.3, 95% CI 1.9-15.2). After adjustment for confounding, the risk of HIV type 1 infection remained substantially higher among sexual partners who had had unprotected receptive anal intercourse with infected index subjects with a T lymphocyte subset ratio of less than or equal to 0.50 (OR = 7.0, 95% CI 1.8-28.0) compared with partners who had had unprotected receptive anal intercourse with infected index subjects with a T cell ratio of greater than 0.50 (OR = 3.3, 95% CI 1.1-10.0).

5402,0.001,1.0000,"Routine military screening identified human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in an asymptomatic dentist who had three prior negative antibody tests. A look-back investigation evaluated the provider and the practice and provided notification, counseling, and HIV testing for patients. Test results were linked to dental procedures categorized by levels of invasiveness. Of 1631 patients tested, all were negative for antibody to HIV. Analysis of 12,164 procedures on 876 patients determined 20.5% of patients had procedures from the highest stratum of invasiveness; 42% had only low-risk exposure. Stratification of the degree of invasive exposure and clinical evaluation of disease stage in the infected health care worker are important in look-back investigations. The early stage of disease in the provider, the adherence to infection control precautions, and the low percentage of invasive procedures may have contributed to the lack of transmission. These results are consistent with current assessment that risk of transmission of HIV during invasive medical procedures is low."

We assessed behavioral interventions associated with further increase, stabilization, and decrease in the size of the population with high-risk behavior. Treatment interventions included increase in treatment uptake and use of direct-acting antivirals. If we assumed that without behavioral interventions high-risk behavior spread further according to the trends observed over the last decade and that the treatment practice did not change, HCV incidence converged to 10.7/100 person-years. All assessed behavioral interventions alone resulted in reduced HCV transmissions. Stabilization of high-risk behavior combined with increased treatment uptake and the use of direct-acting antivirals reduced incidence by 77% (from 2.2 in 2015 to 0.5/100 person-years) and prevalence by 81% (from 4.8% in 2015 to 0.9%) over the next 15 years. Increasing treatment uptake was more effective than increasing treatment efficacy to reduce HCV incidence and prevalence. A decrease in high-risk behavior led to a rapid decline in HCV incidence, independent of treatment interventions."
502,0.001,1.0000,"The capacity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to infect resting cells and to produce progeny particles may contribute significantly to its pathogenicity in vivo. We previously reported that primary culture of resting CD4(+) CD38(+) T-lymphocyte subset had higher production rate of CXCR4-using (X4) HIV-1 than CD4(+) CD38(-) subset. Interleukin (IL)-4 highly contributed to the up-regulation of the X4 virus production in the CD38(+) subset. Here, we show evidences that IL-4 treatment of both resting CD38(+) and CD38(-) subsets allowed the adsorption, entry, and integration of X4 virus at similar rates, while the following viral transcription rate was significantly lower in the CD38(-) than CD38(+) subset. Treatment of the CD38 subsets with IL-4 or phytohemagglutinin revealed no association of X4 virus replication ability in the subsets with classic T-cell activation or proliferation. Interestingly, the activator protein (AP)-1 was significantly activated in the CD38(+) subset after IL-4 treatment, while both nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT)-6 were activated in the IL-4-treated CD38(-) and CD38(-) subsets at similar levels. Thus, IL-4-dependent X4 HIV-1 transcription occurs efficiently in the CD38(+) but not CD38(-) subset of CD4(+) population and AP-1 could play a significant role on viral transcription, leading to the up-regulated X4 virus production in the CD38(+) subset."
6875,0.001,1.0000,"Based on the assumption that fluidity of the plasma membrane and viral envelope is necessary for recruiting additional receptors and ligands to the initial attachment site for ""multiple-site binding,"" we determined the effect of increased temperature on viral infectivity. Infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and a pseudotyped luciferase-expressing chimeric virus using MAGI and GHOST/CXCR4 cells showed that in 1 hr of viral adsorption the extent of virus infection and the amount of tightly adsorbed viruses depended on temperature; and that membrane fluidity increased according to increased temperature. Augmented infection was observed as post-attachment enhancement (PAE) when cells were washed and incubated at 40 C for 1 hr after viral adsorption. PAE was completely inhibited by 1 micro M of anti-CXCR4 peptide T140, and addition of T140 at 20 min resulted in a gradual loss of inhibition of PAE, indicating the need for a 30 to 40 min timelag to ensure tight multiple-site binding. These data suggest that the accumulation of gp120 and receptor complex (multiple-site binding) was needed to complete the infection. Treatments of cells with 0.05% Tween 20 or 2 micro g/ml of anti-HLA-II antibody resulted in increases or decreases, respectively, of attached viruses and the infectivity. As well, Tween 20 and anti-HLAII antibody enhanced and suppressed the fluidity of the plasma membrane, respectively. Amounts of adsorbed viruses and degrees of viral infectivity correlated with the intensity of fluidity of the plasma membrane, probably due to the formation of multiple-site binding."
727,0.001,1.0000,"The hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of the putative second envelope glycoprotein (gp70) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) contains a sequence-specific immunological B-cell epitope that induces the production of antibodies restricted to the specific viral isolate, and anti-HVR1 antibodies are involved in the genetic drift of HVR1 driven by immunoselection (N. Kato, H. Sekiya, Y. Ootsuyama, T. Nakazawa, M. Hijikata, S. Ohkoshi, and K. Shimotohno, J. Virol. 67:3923-3930, 1993). We further investigated the sequence variability of the HCV genomic region that entirely encodes the envelope proteins (gp35 and gp70); these sequences were derived from virus isolated during the acute and chronic phases of hepatitis in one patient, and we found that HVR1 was a major site for genetic mutations in HCV after the onset of hepatitis. We carried out epitope-mapping experiments using the HVR1 sequence derived from the acute phase of hepatitis and identified two overlapping epitopes which are each composed of 11 amino acids (positions 394 to 404 and 397 to 407). The presence of two epitopes within HVR1 suggested that epitope shift happened during the course of hepatitis. Four of six amino acid substitutions detected in HVR1 were located within the two epitopes. We further examined the reactivities of anti-HVR1 antibodies to the substituted amino acid sequences within the two epitopes. HVR1 variants in both epitopes within the HVR1 escaped from anti-HVR1 antibodies that were preexisting in the patient's serum."
1448,0.001,1.0000,"The difference between regional rates of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in patients infected with different subtypes of HIV suggests that genetic determinants exist within HIV that influence the ability of the virus to replicate in the central nervous system (in Uganda, Africa, subtype D HAD rate is 89%, while subtype A HAD rate is 24%). HIV-1 nef is a multifunctional protein with known toxic effects in the brain compartment. The goal of the current study was to identify if specific three-dimensional nef structures may be linked to patients who developed HAD. HIV-1 nef structures were computationally derived for consensus brain and non-brain sequences from a panel of patients infected with subtype B who died due to varied disease pathologies and consensus subtype A and subtype D sequences from Uganda. Site directed mutation analysis identified signatures in brain structures that appear to change binding potentials and could affect folding conformations of brain-associated structures. Despite the large sequence variation between HIV subtypes, structural alignments confirmed that viral structures derived from patients with HAD were more similar to subtype D structures than to structures derived from patient sequences without HAD. Furthermore, structures derived from brain sequences of patients with HAD were more similar to subtype D structures than they were to their own non-brain structures. The potential finding of a brain-specific nef structure indicates that HAD may result from genetic alterations that alter the folding or binding potential of the protein."
9220,0.001,1.0000,"Enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) is the first self-injectable antiretroviral (ARV) therapy approved for the treatment of HIV. This study was undertaken to explore the perceptions of injectable ARVs among physicians and treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients and identify potential motivators or barriers to the initiation of injectable ARV therapies. This empirical study was conducted based on qualitative field research conducted in multiple centres in five European countries and the US. A purposive sampling strategy was employed and structured interviews carried out with physicians and patients. Discussion guides for these interviews focused on attitudinal responses to a range of key areas. For physicians, these areas included HIV treatment, treatment-experienced patients and their relationships with them and injectable therapy usage, while for patients - some of whom were receiving enfuvirtide therapy - the focus included relationships with their physicians and attitudes towards injectable ARV therapy. Sixty-eight physicians and 43 patients were interviewed. Qualitative analysis of the interview responses revealed a number of recurring themes among physician and patient perceptions of HIV and its treatment. Physicians tended to view injectable ARVs as a last resort, with only limited suitability among treatment-experienced patients and a low level of patient acceptability. In contrast, patients generally perceived the potential value of effective injectable ARV therapy, if recommended to them by their physicians, indicating that its benefits could outweigh the drawbacks associated with its administration. This study identified some potential disconnects between physician and patient perceptions of injectable therapy. Our findings emphasize the need for patients to discuss their treatment goals with their physicians so that they can work together to find the regimen that is most likely to achieve these goals."
7310,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) encodes a gene product, Vpr, that facilitates the nuclear uptake of the viral pre-integration complex in non-dividing cells and causes infected cells to arrest in the G(2) phase of the cell cycle. Vpr was also shown to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells and budding yeasts, an effect that was proposed to lead to growth arrest and cell killing in budding yeasts and apoptosis in human cells. In this study, we used a genetic selection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify hexameric peptides that suppress the growth arrest phenotype mediated by Vpr. Fifteen selected glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused peptides were found to overcome to different extents Vpr-mediated growth arrest. Amino acid analysis of the inhibitory peptide sequences revealed the conservation of a di-tryptophan (diW) motif. DiW-containing GST-peptides interacted with Vpr in GST pull-down assays, and their level of interaction correlated with their ability to overcome Vpr-mediated growth arrest. Importantly, Vpr-binding GST-peptides were also found to alleviate Vpr-mediated apoptosis and G(2) arrest in HIV-1-producing CD4(+) T cell lines. Furthermore, they co-localized with Vpr and interfered with its nuclear translocation. Overall, this study defines a class of diW-containing peptides that inhibit HIV-1 Vpr biological activities most likely by interacting with Vpr and interfering with critical protein interactions."
8478,0.001,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of sociodemographic characteristics, patient perceptions, and patient characteristics including spirituality, self-reported adherence, and highly active antiretroviral therapy. The convenience sample consisted of 120 English-speaking adults (60% male, 35% female, 5% transgendered) with HIV/AIDS from two HIV service agencies in a large metropolitan city in the southeastern United States. The mean self-reported adherence was 83.1% (SD = 15.7%). Adherence was significantly correlated with perceived support and absence of barriers, strong intentions to adhere, perceived effectiveness of the medications, higher levels of perceived general health, fewer years of HIV disease, and fewer years on antiretroviral medications. Existential well-being (e.g., viewing life as positive and having meaning) was a weak significant correlate. Backward regression analysis was conducted to identify a parsimonious model of predictors of adherence. The final model included presence of support and absence of barriers, fewer years of HIV infection, no current alcohol use, perceived severity of HIV, existential well-being, and male gender. This model explained 19.4% of the variance in adherence (observed F[6, 100] = 5.6, p < .0001)."
5876,0.001,1.0000,"Many physicians, dentists, and allied health personnel sustain occupational exposures to blood and other body fluids that increase their risk of contracting type B viral hepatitis. Overall, the risk of hepatitis B among persons employed in health-related fields is estimated to be approximately four times that in the general adult population. Studies on the incidence of infection and the prevalence of hepatitis B serologic markers have further defined risk in specific occupational categories and work activities. Physicians and dentists are five to ten times more likely than the general adult population to experience hepatitis B infection. Infection rates ten or more times above the average have often been characteristic of surgeons, patient care personnel in dialysis units and institutions for the mentally handicapped, and clinical laboratory workers having frequent contact with blood samples."
3856,0.001,1.0000,"Because milk-borne transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diminishes the benefits of perinatal antiviral drug therapy in developing countries, we have developed a new strategy to prevent postnatal and, possibly, intrapartum virus transmission in a primate model. Eight neonatal rhesus macaques were exposed orally to pathogenic simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV); 4 neonates were then given intramuscular postexposure prophylaxis with 3 anti-HIV human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nMAbs) with potent cross-clade and cross-group neutralization activity. Untreated infants experienced high viral RNA levels and CD4(+) T-cell losses and died (median survival time, 5.5 weeks). In contrast, all 4 nMAb-treated neonates were protected from infection (P=.028); their plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and lymph nodes remained virus negative for >1 year. These data are important for designing clinical trials in human neonates and have general implications for AIDS vaccine development, as the epitopes recognized by the 3 nMAbs are conserved among diverse primary isolates."
5933,0.001,1.0000,"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) family is involved in a two-stage detoxification process of a wide range of environmental toxins, carcinogen and antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (ART) drugs. The aim of this study is to describe the impact of genetic polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1-313A/G in the risk of ARV-associated hepatotoxicity in HIV-infected individuals and its modulation in hepatotoxic patients. We enrolled a total of 34 patients with hepatotoxicity, 131 HIV-infected individuals without hepatotoxicity under non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor containing ART and 153 unrelated healthy individuals. With a case-control design, polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1-313A/G gene were genotyped by PCR and restriction enzyme-length polymorphism. Genotypes of GSTT1 null were significantly higher in HIV-infected individuals as compared with healthy controls (P=0.01, odds ratio (OR)=1.54). HIV-infected individuals with GSTM1-null genotype showed higher risk (P=0.09, OR=1.37) for hepatotoxicity, but risk was not significant. On evaluating gene-gene interaction models, GSTM1 null and GSTT1 null showed significant association with the risk of hepatotoxicity in HIV-infected individuals (P=0.004, OR=2.67) owing to synergistic effect of these genes. Individuals with GSTT1-null and GSTM1-null genotypes showed higher risk of hepatotoxicity with advanced stage of (CD4<200) of HIV infection (P=0.18, OR=1.39; P=0.63, OR=1.13). In case-only analysis, GSTT1-null genotype among alcohol users showed elevated risk of hepatotoxicity in HIV-infected individuals (P=0.12, OR=1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94-1.97) as compared with GSTT1 genotypes. The carriers GSTM1-null+GSTT1-null genotype among nevirapine user showed prominent risk of hepatotoxicity in HIV-infected individuals (P=0.12, OR=4.21, 95% CI: 0.60-29.54). Hence, we can conclude that GSTT1-null and GSTM1-null genotypes alone and in combination may predict the acquisition of hepatotoxicity."
7869,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in vivo is dependent upon the interaction of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 with CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) or CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). To study the determinants of the gp120-coreceptor association, we generated a set of chimeric HIV-1 coreceptors which express all possible combinations of the four extracellular domains of CCR5 and CXCR4. Stable U87 astroglioma cell lines expressing CD4 and individual chimeric coreceptor proteins were tested against a variety of R5, X4, and R5X4 envelope glycoproteins and virus strains for their ability to support HIV-1-mediated cell fusion and infection, respectively. Each of the cell lines promoted fusion with cells expressing an HIV envelope glycoprotein, except for U87.CD4.5455, which presents the first extracellular loop (ECL1) and flanking sequences of CXCR4 in the context of CCR5. However, all of the chimeric coreceptors allowed productive infection by one or more of the viral strains tested. Viral phenotype was a predictive factor for the observed activity of the chimeric molecules; X4 and R5X4 HIV strains utilized a majority of the chimeras, while R5 strains were limited in their ability to infect cells expressing these chimeric molecules. The expression of CCR5 ECL2 within the CXCR4 backbone supported infection by an R5 primary isolate, but no chimeras bearing the N terminus of CCR5 exhibited activity with R5 strains. Remarkably, the introduction of any CXCR4 domain into the CCR5 backbone was sufficient to allow utilization by multiple X4 strains. However, critical determinants within ECL2 and/or ECL3 of CXCR4 were apparent for all X4 viruses upon replacement of these domains in CXCR4 with CCR5 sequences. Unexpectedly, chimeric coreceptor-facilitated entry was blocked in all cases by the presence of the CXCR4-specific inhibitor AMD3100. Our data provide proof that CCR5 contains elements that support usage by X4 viral strains and demonstrate that the gp120 interaction sites of CCR5 and CXCR4 are structurally related."
2900,0.001,1.0000,"We investigate the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on humoral immune responses during a 24-month follow up of 15 HIV patients with acute primary HIV infection. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of the therapeutic protocol they were following at the time of entry: a) five naive patients (untreated or treated with only ZDV or AZT); b) five patients following a triple combination of ZDV+ lamivudine (3TC)+ saquinovir (SQV); and c) five patients on a four-drug combination of ZDV+3TC+SQV+ ritonavir (RTV). The results show that the early introduction of HAART greatly reduces plasma viremia levels and restores the number of CD4 cells. A significant correlation was found between anti HIV neutralising activity and the four-drug, but not the three-drug combination. The reduction in infectivity was directed against viruses of different clades and associated with immunoglobulin fractions. Moreover, the neutralising antibodies in the HAART-treated patients appeared after two weeks of treatment and remained stable throughout the 24 months of follow up. The early appearance of neutralising antibodies represent an important component of immune responses during primary HIV infection, may contribute towards immune reconstitution in patients on HAART, and give further information that may be useful in developing new strategies designed to eradicate the disease."
5593,0.001,1.0000,"In the pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, clinical trials showed that interferon (IFN) treatment was able to delay AIDS progression and prolong survival. Along with HAART, ancillary use of IFN during primary infection and before HAART therapy initiation has been effective. Also endogenous IFN may positively affect the progression of HIV infection, as suggested in GB virus type C (GBV-C) coinfected patients. In this pilot study, we tried to prevent rebound of HIV replication in patients who interrupted HAART by covering the drug-free time with administration of pegylated IFN (PEGIFN). Twenty-four HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients who started IFN treatment for liver disease, after variable time from having interrupted HAART, were enrolled. HIV RNA was determined during a 2-month period. In patients who interrupted HAART at variable times before initiating IFN and, therefore, had experienced a complete viral rebound, IFN caused a significant reduction of viral load lasting at least 4 weeks. Moreover, 3 of the 4 patients who started IFN concomitantly with the HAART discontinuation showed complete control of viral rebound, delaying the resumption of viral replication for more than 2 weeks. These preliminary findings suggest that a structured therapy interruptions (STI) strategy may be feasible provided that IFN is administered during the drug-free times, possibly delaying drug resistance, lessening toxicity, reducing costs, and prolonging survival."
1129,0.001,1.0000,"Delavirdine is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with in vitro activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that is currently being evaluated in combination regimens with various nucleoside analogs, including didanosine. Due to the pH-dependent solubility of delavirdine, the buffering agents in didanosine formulations may reduce delavirdine absorption. To evaluate the potential interaction between these agents, 12 HIV-infected patients (mean [+/- standard deviation] CD4+ cell count, 304 +/- 213/mm3) were enrolled in a three-way crossover single-dose study. Didanosine (125 to 200 mg given as buffered tablets) and delavirdine mesylate (400 mg) pharmacokinetics were evaluated when each drug was given alone (treatments A and B, respectively), when the two drugs were given concurrently (treatment C), and when didanosine was given 1 h after delavirdine (treatment D). Delavirdine exposure was reduced by concurrent administration of didanosine. The maximum drug concentration in serum (Cmax) was reduced from 7.22 +/- 4.0 to 3.51 +/- 1.9 microM, and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC0-->infinity) was reduced from 22.5 +/- 14 to 14 +/- 5.7 microM.h. The extent of N-dealkylation, as indicated by the ratio of the N-dealkylated delavirdine AUC0-->infinity to the delavirdine AUC0-->infinity, was unchanged across study treatments (P = 0.708). Reductions in didanosine exposure were observed during concurrent administration with delavirdine with a Cmax reduction from 4.65 +/- 2.0 to 3.22 +/- 0.59 microM and an AUC0-->infinity reduction from 7.93 +/- 3.9 to 6.54 +/- 2.3 microM.h. Thus, concurrent administration of delavirdine and didanosine may reduce the AUC0-->infinity of both drugs, although the clinical significance of this reduction is unknown. Administration of delavirdine 1 h before didanosine avoided the interaction. Due to the single-dose nature of this study, these findings require further evaluation at steady state."
3277,0.001,1.0000,"We used a population-based cohort study design to describe the demographic characteristics of the HIV-infected population in Denmark and their variation over time. HIV treatment in Denmark is restricted to 9 centres, and all 3941 HIV-1 infected patients more than 15 y old seen at these centres in 1995-2003 were included. We found an estimated HIV prevalence of 70 per 100,000, and a mean annual incidence rate of 5.1 per 100,000 persons. The number of newly infected individuals was stable with a median of 231 per y (period 1995-2002), whereas the number of deaths decreased from 166 in 1995 to 50 in 2000 (p=0.000) and remained stable thereafter. Of the enrolled patients, 75% were males, 80% were Caucasian, 13% were black African, and the primary risk behaviour was male-to-male sexual contact (44%), heterosexual contact (36%), and injection drug use (11%). During the y 1995-2003 we found an increase in age at diagnosis (p=0.000), and no major changes in gender, race, mode of infection, or baseline CD4+ cell count and viral load, neither overall not within subgroups of patients. In this period 14.5% had AIDS at the time of HIV diagnosis. Our data do not confirm concerns about unmonitored evolution in the HIV epidemic in Denmark."
9997,0.001,1.0000,"Recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the graft is the major problem for patients with chronic HBV infection undergoing liver transplantation, which could be potentiated by the immunosuppression. In the present study, we used lymphocytes and hepatocytes isolated from patients with chronic HBV infection to investigate in vitro the effects of FK506 with and without methylprednisolone (25 ng/mL) on mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell activation marker expression, and HBV replication in human hepatocytes. Increasing concentrations of FK506 (0.1, 0.5, and 5 ng/mL) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation with a reduction of the stimulation index by 9.2%, 39.0%, and 55.1%, respectively, with no difference between 25 chronic HBV carriers and normal controls. Methylprednisolone alone had no effect but potentiated the inhibitory effect of all three FK506 concentrations, such that the stimulation index was decreased by 20%, 56.2%, and 65.7%, respectively. FK506 (0.5 ng/ mL) reduced both the percentage of interleukin-2 receptor expressing T cells and the cell surface density of this receptor by 7.1% and 8.7% (P < .01), whereas it only reduced the proportion of HLA-DR expressing T cells by 6.8%. FK506 did not change significantly the intracellular HBV DNA or the hepatic expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in short-term culture of human hepatocytes, whereas methylprednisolone increased the percentage of HBsAg-positive hepatocytes in all 5 patients with active viral replication. These results indicate that the effects of FK506 on T-cell activation in chronic HBV carriers are identical to normal subjects, resulting in marked suppression of T-lymphocyte function but only modest reduction in the expression of cell surface activation markers. The drug showed no direct stimulatory effect on viral replication, suggesting that FK506 can be a useful, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent for liver graft recipients with chronic HBV infection."

This medical care has 5 main objectives: 1) Promotion of good health (through standard recommendation of hygiene, health habits and regular checkups); 2) prevention of infectious complications (through detection of latent pathogens, chemoprophylaxis, vaccination and avoidance of risky exposures); 3) Treatment of complications (mainly infectious, through early diagnosis and proper treatment); 4) Delay of HIV disease progression (through timely and properly chosen antiretroviral therapy); 5) Reduction of HIV infection spread from index case to others (through promotion of responsible behavior and avoidance of pregnancy and HIV exposure to others). Studies for evaluating global health and immunologic status and carriage of potential pathogens are discussed as well as the criteria and timing for chemoprophylaxis for tuberculosis and P carinii pneumonia (PCP). Algorithms for the management of major clinical syndromes are presented: Diarrhea (afebrile, mostly parasitic, versus febrile, frequently bacterial); Pneumonia (lobar mostly bacterial versus interstitial, frequently PCP especially if lymphopenic and not receiving PCP prophylaxis); Brain mass lesion (most commonly toxoplasmosis). Finally, the evaluation and diagnostic possibilities of febrile patients is presented, based upon the immunologic status and associated symptoms."

This study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its related factors among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Thailand. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 259 patients at a tertiary care hospital. HRQOL was assessed using the Thai version of the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) questionnaire. Socio-demographics and clinical status were measured using a self-administered questionnaire. Multiple linear regression models were used to explore associations between socio-demographic status, clinical status, and HRQL. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that employment status was strongly related to better overall physical and mental health summary scores (PHS, MHS). In addition, patients with disclosure of HIV status, aged over 50 years, and having at least a rating of good health in the nurses' opinion were the independent positive predictive factors for overall PHS. While being on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and good compliance with ART were positive predictive factors for overall MHS. Improving and strengthening quality of life among PLWHAs are important goals for HIV/AIDS services. Regular assessment of HRQL can provide potential information for intervention to improve quality of life."
4145,0.001,1.0000,"CR2 (CD21), the EBV receptor, was detected on three of four CD4-positive cell lines by indirect fluorescent labeling, and its corresponding mRNA was found by use of the reverse transcription-based polymerase chain reaction. To determine whether CR2 on CD4-positive cells was functional, their ability to be infected by EBV was analyzed. EBV DNA, EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2A), and EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER1) transcripts could be detected in CR2-expressing CD4-positive cells following infection by the B95.8 strain of EBV. Analysis of the terminal region showed the EBV genome remained linear following infection, and copy number decreased with time. Since CD4-positive cell lines are targets for HIV-1 infection, the effects of EBV infection on HIV-1 expression were analyzed. HIV-1 replication was upregulated when CD4-positive cells were coinfected with EBV strain B95.8 but not P3HR-1K. These results suggested that EBNA-2 is involved in upregulation of HIV-1 expression in T lymphoblastoid cell lines. To test this hypothesis an EBNA-2-expression vector was transfected into T lymphoblastoid cell lines and HIV-1 expression measured. First, trans-activation of HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by Tat was enhanced by EBNA-2 type 1 expression. trans-Activation of the HIV-1 LTR by Tat was also enhanced when CD4-positive cells were infected by EBV (strain B95.8) encoding an intact EBNA-2, but not by P3HR-1K with a deleted EBNA-2. In addition, CD4-positive cell clones stably expressing EBNA-2 supported enhanced HIV-1 replication as measured by accumulation of reverse transcriptase activity and syncytium induction. This provides direct evidence that EBV infection can enhance HIV-1 replication in T cells. Whether this in vitro phenomenon contributes to disease progression in vivo remains to be determined."

Ten phenotypes in GN, 14 in CAH, 10 in GC-S and 23 in H were found. Some rare phenotypes appeared in the individual cases of ill children. Statistical analysis was performed by chi-square test. Each group was compared to the others. We found significantly higher frequency of the A3B2,Q0 phenotype in CAH than in H as well as significant increase of the A x 4 gene frequency in GC-S as compared to H. However, these events could be caused by limited number of tested patients. We suspect that the association between C4 alleles and immune-complex diseases, studied here, does not rather exist."
3568,0.001,1.0000,"We have analyzed the molecular dynamics of emergence of drug-resistant strains in patients receiving lamivudine therapy for chronic hepatitis B. Twenty consecutive patients with lamivudine resistance were studied (13 hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]-positive patients and 7 HBe antibody [anti-HBe]-positive patients). Determination of viral genotype, precore mutants, and polymerase gene mutants (L528M, M552V, M552I) was performed using the research version of Lipa-HBV. Quantitative analysis of HBV DNA was performed using both branched DNA (bDNA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Polymerase mutants (genotypic resistance) were found in 16 of 20 patients. Genotypic resistance was detected earlier than the phenotypic resistance (P =.004). Quantitative PCR allowed detection of viral DNA throughout the entire study period in 16 of 20 patients. Analysis of pretreatment variables showed that high alanine transaminase (ALT) levels (>3 x the upper limit of normal [ULN]) was associated with a more rapid selection of drug-resistant mutants (P =.027) and a high hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level (>1,497 Meq/mL, bDNA) with a more rapid occurrence of phenotypic resistance (P =.04). At the time of viral breakthrough, the mean serum HBV-DNA values were not different from the pretreatment values (P =.37). ALT levels were higher in anti-HBe-positive patients compared with pretreatment values and to HBeAg-positive patients (P =.01). In 8 patients, antiviral therapy was modified after viral breakthrough, with the introduction of famciclovir and/or interferon alfa. Viral DNA became undetectable by bDNA in 3 patients who received interferon. Our results suggest that genotypic assays for polymerase mutant detection and quantitative determination of viremia with highly sensitive assay are warranted for an optimal monitoring of antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis B."
2401,0.001,1.0000,"nef alleles derived from a large number of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were analyzed to investigate the frequency of disrupted nef genes and to elucidate whether specific amino acid substitutions in Nef are associated with different stages of disease. We confirm that deletions or gross abnormalities in nef are rarely present. However, a comparison of Nef consensus sequences derived from 41 long-term nonprogressors and from 50 individuals with progressive HIV-1 infection revealed that specific variations are associated with different stages of infection. Five amino acid variations in Nef (T15, N51, H102, L170, and E182) were more frequently observed among nonprogressors, while nine features (an additional N-terminal PxxP motif, A15, R39, T51, T157, C163, N169, Q170, and M182) were more frequently found in progressors. Strong correlations between the frequency of these variations in Nef and both the CD4(+)-cell count and the viral load were observed. Moreover, analysis of sequential samples obtained from two progressors revealed that several variations in Nef, which were more commonly observed in patients with low CD4(+)-T-cell counts, were detected only during or after progression to immunodeficiency. Our results indicate that sequence variations in Nef are associated with different stages of HIV-1 infection and suggest a link between nef gene function and the immune status of the infected individual."
6485,0.001,1.0000,"A therapeutic dilemma arises once HIV-infected patients develop a break-through of HIV-replication under potent antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, we studied whether patients (n = 12) who failed double nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTI) plus indinavir or ritonavir triple therapy can be rescued when therapy is switched to double protease inhibitor (PI) treatment (nelfinavir and hard gel saquinavir) and stavudine. With the rescue regimen HIV-RNA levels initially dropped from 148,571 +/- 45,258 copies/ml to 9,310 +/- 6, 965 copies/ml at week 4 (p = 0.0117). However, virus load subsequently increased to almost baseline levels (131,230 +/- 37,743 copies/ml) at week 12. Likewise, CD4-cell counts could only be stabilized initially (baseline 267 +/- 51; week 4 296 +/- 65 cells/microl), but gradually declined thereafter (216 +/- 34 cells/microl week 12). Before therapy was switched, the viral protease gene from 5 analyzed patients showed 3-5 amino acid substitutions. Moreover, 4 of these patients had one amino acid substitution associated with resistance to nelfinavir. Our data suggest that HIV-infected patients resistant to indinavir or ritonavir and double NRTI combination therapy respond to double PI nelfinavir/saquinavir and D4T rescue therapy only initially but have no sustained benefit."
5202,0.001,1.0000,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor in the development of chronic hepatitis (CH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The activation‑induced cytidine deaminase (AID)/apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide‑like (APOBEC) family of cytidine deaminases is significant in innate immunity, as it restricts numerous viruses, including HBV, through hypermutation‑dependent and ‑independent mechanisms. It is important to induce covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA degradation by interferon‑α without causing side effects in the infected host cell. Furthermore, organisms possess multiple mechanisms to regulate the expression of AID/APOBECs, control their enzymatic activity and restrict their access to DNA or RNA substrates. Therefore, the AID/APOBECs present promising targets for preventing and treating viral infections. In addition, gene polymorphisms of the AID/APOBEC family may alter host susceptibility to HBV acquisition and CH disease progression. Through G‑to‑A hypermutation, AID/APOBECs also edit HBV DNA and facilitate the mutation of HBV DNA, which may assist the virus to evolve and potentially escape from the immune responses. The AID/APOBEC family and their associated editing patterns may also exert oncogenic activity. Understanding the effects of cytidine deaminases in CH virus-induced hepatocarcinogenesis may aid with developing efficient prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against HCC."
2309,0.001,1.0000,"S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12, collectively known as myeloid-related proteins (MRPs), are highly expressed by the myeloid cell lineage and are found in the extracellular milieu during infections and inflammatory conditions. Recent data showed high levels of MRPs in the serum of HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients which correlated with disease progression and low CD4(+) counts. Therefore, we set out to investigate the effect of MRPs on HIV-1 replication. We observed a 4- to 5-fold induction of virus production in J1.1, a human T lymphoid cell line latently infected with HIV-1, following treatment with MRPs. Using luciferase-based reporter gene assays, we demonstrated that MRPs induce a dose- and time-dependent activation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter region that could be blocked by specific anti-MRP polyclonal Abs and by physical denaturation of these proteins. The MRP-mediated induction was acting through the HIV-1 enhancer sequence and was dependent upon NF-kappaB activity. These latter results were also confirmed by EMSA experiments conducted in Jurkat cells and freshly isolated PBMCs. In conclusion, we demonstrate that MRPs induce HIV-1 transcriptional activity and viral replication in infected CD4(+) T-lymphocytes at concentrations similar to those found in the serum of HIV-1-infected patients."
5216,0.001,1.0000,"The rate of viral replication appears to play a pivotal role in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pathogenesis and disease progression as it outstrips the capacity of the immune system to respond. Important cellular sites for HIV-1 production include T lymphocytes and tissue macrophages. Antiviral strategies, including newer treatment modalities such as gene therapy of HIV-1-susceptible cell populations, must be capable of engendering durable inhibitory effects to HIV-1 replication in both of these primary cell types in order to be effective. Among the potential genetic targets for intervention in the HIV-1 life cycle, the Rev regulatory system, consisting of Rev and its binding site, the Rev-responsive element (RRE), stands out as particularly attractive. Rev is essential for maintaining the stability of the viral genomic RNA as well as viral mRNAs encoding key structural and regulatory proteins. Moreover, it exhibits favorable threshold kinetics, in that Rev concentrations must rise above a critical level to exert their effect. To disable Rev function, primary T cells or macrophages were transduced with anti-Rev single-chain immunoglobulin (SFv) or RRE decoy genes either singly or in combination by employing adeno-associated virus vectors and then challenged with HIV-1. By directing both a protein and a nucleic acid against the normal interaction between Rev and the RRE, this genetic antiviral strategy effectively inhibited infection by either clinical or laboratory virus isolates. These results provide a framework for novel interventions to reduce virus production in the infected host."
8284,0.001,1.0000,"Mutations in the basal core promoter (BCP) and precore (PC) regions are associated with persistent and intermittently high hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication in several patients. The variability in the functional domains of BCP and PC region of HBV and their association with disease progression and clinical outcome were assessed in Eastern India, an unique region where three HBV genotypes, A, D, and C are prevalent among the same ethnic group. PCR amplification and direct sequencing of BCP and PC region was done on sera obtained from 130 HBsAg positive subjects with different clinical presentations. Associations of the apparent risk factors with clinical advancement were evaluated by statistical methods including multiple logistic regression analyses (MLR). HBV genotype A was present in 33.08%, C in 25.38%, and D in 41.54% cases. Genotypes A and C were associated with higher rate of T1762/A1764 mutations than the most predominant genotype D. HBeAg negative state was associated with considerably higher rate of C1753 mutation. T1762/A1764 along with C1753 was common among cirrhosis and T1762/A1764 without C1753 was frequent among chronic liver disease cases. No significant association was found between A1896 point mutation and clinical status. Multivariate analysis revealed that T1762/A1764 double mutation, HBV/A, age ≥25 years, C1753 and A1899 were critical factors for clinical advancement while age ≥25 years and C1753 as significant predictor for cirrhosis in comparison with chronic liver disease. In conclusion, the analysis of the BCP variability may help in monitoring the progression towards advanced liver disease in Eastern Indian patients."
4138,0.001,1.0000,"Lamivudine has been shown to be effective in patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B, but its long-term efficacy and the rate of resistant mutations in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B is less clear. Twenty-nine patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, who have received lamivudine for at least 1 year were studied to determine the antiviral response, the rate and pattern of lamivudine-resistant mutations, and the effect of lamivudine-resistant mutations on HBeAg status. The mean duration of treatment was 21 +/- 7 months. Before treatment, core promoter variant was detected in 16 (55%) patients and precore stop codon variant in 18 (62%) patients. Serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was detected by solution hybridization assay in 62%, 4%, and 24% and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in 100%, 31%, and 40% at months 0, 6, and 24, respectively. The cumulative rates of detection of lamivudine-resistant mutations after 1 and 2 years of treatment were 10% and 56%, respectively. In addition to the duration of treatment, core promoter mutation was associated with the selection of lamivudine-resistant mutants. Three patients with lamivudine-resistant mutations had reversion of the precore stop codon mutation; in 2 patients this was accompanied by the reappearance of HBeAg. We found that lamivudine-resistant mutants were detected at similar rates in patients with HBeAg-negative as in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B. Additional changes in other parts of the HBV genome may restore the replication fitness of lamivudine-resistant mutants."
3642,0.001,1.0000,"We conducted a large-scale survey to determine the frequency and clinical significance of mutations in the pre-core region of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sera from 263 patients with chronic HBV infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified HBV DNA. Four major missense/nonsense mutations (M) were found: (M1) C-->T at nucleotide position 1856, Pro-->Ser at codon 15; (M2) G-->A at position 1896, Trp-->stop at codon 28; (M3) G-->A at position 1898, Gly-->Ser at codon 29; and (M4) G-->A at position 1899, Gly-->Asp at codon 29. The commonest conserved mutation was M0: T-->C at position 1858, Pro-->Pro at codon 15. We found that M1 and M2 were mutually exclusive, M3 was only found in association with M1, and M4 was predominantly found in association with M2. All patients with M1 but none of those with M2 had M0. The invariable coexistence of certain mutations in codon 15 and codons 28 and 29 and the mutual exclusion of other mutations in these two noncontiguous regions is related to the stem-loop structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence located in the precore/core region. M2 and M4 enhance the stability of the stem by providing two additional paired sites. M1 destroys an existing base pair. However, M1 only occurred in the presence of M0, which provides an extra paired site, and 50% of patients with M1 had M3, a compensatory mutation that restores base pairing at this site. Our data support the proposed secondary structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence. The primary function of the mutations in the pre-core region is to enhance stability of this secondary structure to ensure perpetuation of viral replication."
4883,0.001,1.0000,"A cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the prevalence and predictors of suicidal ideation and past suicide attempt in an Australian sample of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and HIV-negative homosexual and bisexual men. Sixty-five HIV-negative and 164 HIV-positive men participated. A suicidal ideation score was derived from using five items selected from the Beck Depression Inventory and the General Health Questionnaire (28-item version). Lifetime and current prevalence rates of psychiatric disorder were evaluated with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version-III-R. The HIV-positive (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] Stage IV) men (n = 85) had significantly higher total suicidal ideation scores than the asymptomatic HIV-positive men (CDC Stage II/III) (n = 79) and the HIV-negative men. High rates of past suicide attempt were detected in the HIV-negative (29%) and HIV-positive men (21%). Factors associated with suicidal ideation included being HIV-positive, the presence of current psychiatric disorder, higher neuroticism scores, external locus of control, and current unemployment. In the HIV-positive group analyzed separately, higher suicidal ideation was discriminated by the adjustment to HIV diagnosis (greater hopelessness and lower fighting spirit), disease factors (greater number of current acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]-related conditions), and background variables (neuroticism). Significant predictors of a past attempted suicide were a positive lifetime history of psychiatric disorder (particularly depression diagnoses), a lifetime history of infection drug use, and a family history of suicide attempts. The findings indicate increased levels of suicidal ideation in symptomatic HIV-positive men and highlight the role that multiple psychosocial factors associated with suicidal ideation and attempted suicide play in this population."
7756,0.001,1.0000,"The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence and natural history of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) associated psychiatric, neuropsychological and neurological abnormalities. A total of 408 subjects were recruited in Nairobi and Kinshasa. The study consisted of a cross sectional phase and a longitudinal follow up. Assessment was made by a data collection instrument including six modules. The intercentre and intracentre reliability in the use of the each module have been formally evaluated. The mean global score on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale was significantly higher in symptomatic seropositive individuals than in matched seronegative controls. In conclusion, these data suggest that the risk of subtle cognitive deficits may be increased in asymptomatic stages of HIV-1 infection."
6059,0.001,1.0000,"Acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with the rapid development of neutralization escape mutations. The degree to which viral evolution persists in chronic infection has not been well characterized, nor is it clear if all patients develop high-level neutralization antibody escape. We therefore measured neutralizing antibody responses against autologous and heterologous viruses in a cohort of acutely and chronically infected subjects (n = 65). Neutralizing antibody responses against both autologous virus and heterologous viruses were lower among individuals with acute infection than among those with chronic infection. Among chronically infected individuals, there was a negative correlation between the level of neutralizing antibodies against autologous virus and the level of viremia. In contrast, there was a positive correlation between the level of neutralizing antibodies against a panel of heterologous viruses and the level of viremia. Viral evolution, as defined by the presence of higher neutralizing titers directed against earlier viruses than against contemporaneous viruses, was evident for subjects with recent infection but absent for those with chronic infection. In summary, neutralizing antibody responses against contemporaneous autologous viruses are absent in early HIV infection but can be detected at low levels in chronic infection, particularly among those controlling HIV in the absence of therapy. HIV replication either directly or indirectly drives the production of increasing levels of antibodies that cross-neutralize heterologous primary isolates. Collectively, these observations indicate that although HIV continuously drives the production of neutralizing antibodies, there may be limits to the capacity of the virus to evolve continuously in response to these antibodies. These observations also suggest that the neutralizing antibody response may contribute to the long-term control of HIV in some patients while protecting against HIV superinfection in most patients."
6200,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are often associated with extrahepatic immunological manifestations, including various autoimmune disorders. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of HCV markers in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and to determine any relationship with HCV infection. Eighty-three patients with MG. 40 men aged 20-93 years and 43 women aged 13-87 years (mean age 54 years) were studied. The MG patients were positive for antibody to acetylcholine receptor in addition, their sera was analysed for antibody to HCV (HCVAb) and HCV RNA, HCVAb was detected in two of the 83 patients (2.4%). Four patients were repeatedly HCV RNA positive. They were infected by HCV genotype 1 (one patient), HCV genotype 2a (two patients) and an undetermined HCV genotype in one patient. They received plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. Among the four patients, one was infected after the onset of MG without receiving a blood transfusion or using intravenous drugs. The other three had chronic hepatitis C which was discovered at the same time as MG and only one patient had been exposed to blood products. The prevalence of HCV markers in patients with MG (4.8%) was higher than that reported for the general French population, about 1%. This prevalence is similar to that occurring in patients exposed to plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin. In conclusion, HCV appears to play little, if any, role in causing MG. The higher prevalence of infection among MG patients may be related to transmission in the course of therapy."
4345,0.001,1.0000,"To examine the prevalence, quantification, and factors that influence HIV in the cell-free compartment of breast milk, we performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on samples obtained from HIV-1-infected study subjects. Virus was detected in 86 of 136 samples (63.2%) from 79 study subjects. HIV RNA quantity ranged from undetectable to 227,586 copies/ml. Prevalence and mean viral load were not affected by postnatal ages or maternal vitamin A supplementation. Among study subjects with multiple samples, breast milk viral load did not change at different postnatal ages. Breast milk viral load correlated positively with plasma viral load (r = 0.47; p =.005) and negatively with maternal CD4 count at entry to the study (r = -0.26; p =.02). Mothers of HIV-infected children had a higher proportion of detectable HIV RNA in their breast milk than mothers of uninfected children (p =.03) and higher mean log10 HIV RNA quantities (p =.04). In a multivariate logistic regression model, log10 HIV RNA quantity in breast milk was significantly associated with the risk of mother-child transmission (odds ratio [OR], 2.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-6.51). Thus, prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections and of mastitis and early weaning may be important elements of a public health policy that is relevant to women in developing countries with HIV infection. Where available, antiretrovirals may also have an impact on opportunistic infections and mastitis."
6448,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with long-term hemodialysis (HD) in Japan was assessed using an Ortho HCV Antibody ELISA TEST system. Out of 51 patients, 48 of whom had a history of blood transfusions, 15 (29%) were positive for anti-HCV. This figure is much higher than that in other countries (1-20%), and the difference may reflect a select population. Six (33%) of 18 HD patients with chronic hepatic disease were anti-HCV positive. On the other hand, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers was 39% (20/51), and 7 (35%) of these 20 with HBV markers were also positive for HCV. The prevalence of anti-HCV showed no relation to the duration of HD treatment. Although a correlation between the prevalence and the blood units transfused was not demonstrated, anti-HCV positive patients had received blood transfusions amounting to significantly more units than those given to negative patients. Anti-HCV was detected in approximately one-third of patients with long-term HD, indicating a lower prevalence of HCV infection as compared to that of HBV infection, and patients with hepatitis of type C accounted for about one-third of HD patients with chronic hepatic disease."
4293,0.001,1.0000,"In order to evaluate the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the etiology of chronic liver diseases, paired sera of 143 patients with biopsy-documented chronic hepatitis were tested for HBsAg and anti-HBs by radioimmunoassay method. HBsAg was detected in 67.3% of patients with a preceding verified eipsode of acute hepatitis, and in 26.7% of patients with a cryptogenic form of chronic hepatitis. HBsAg was not found in any of patients with alcoholic chronic hepatitis and in only two of 18 patients with other forms of chronic liver disease. No significant difference in the incidence of anti-HBs was observed in all groups of patients. According to previous studies our results confirm the higher prevalence of HBV infection in etiology of chronic persistent and aggressive hepatitis and indicate that this prevalence may be observed especially in Middle and South Italy. The presence of HBsAg in the serum of 37.2% of our patients with cirrhosis compared with 9% of reported cases in North Italy suggest that HBV plays an important role in the etiology of cirrhosis of the liver in our area."
9888,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with an increased risk for human herpesviruses (HHVs) and their related diseases. Methods for limiting the transmission of HHVs require a better understanding of the prevalence and infectiousness of oral HHVs in HIV-infected patients. We performed quantitative PCR to investigate the prevalence, quantity, risk, and correlates of salivary HHVs from 58 HIV-seropositive individuals in a case control study. HHVs were significantly more prevalent in the salivas of HIV-seropositive persons than in those of the controls (odds ratios [ORs], 4.2 to 26.2; P<or=0.008). In HIV-infected patients, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) were detected in 90%, 57%, 31% and 16% of samples, respectively, compared with 48%, 24%, 2%, and 2%, respectively, of samples from controls. Multiple HHVs were observed in 71% of HIV-seropositive persons and only 16% of controls (OR, 13.0; 95% confidence interval, 5.29 to 32.56). HIV-positive patients had significantly higher EBV loads than HIV-negative persons (P<0.0001). HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts above 200 cells/microl had increased probability for having HHV-8 in saliva (P=0.009) compared with patients whose counts were less than 200. In contrast, HSV-1, EBV, and CMV were detected more often when CD4 counts were low. High salivary HHV loads were detected for those (n=7) with oral lesions. These findings suggest that saliva is a potential risk factor for the acquisition of multiple HHVs, and several host factors may function to accelerate HHV reactivation or replication in patients with HIV infection."
1161,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the general population and in various high risk groups in south India was assessed. A total of 258 out of 3589 (7.1%) subjects (both general and risk groups) tested positive for HCV RNA by RT-PCR, while the third generation ELISA detected only 6.1% (221/3589). This suggests that a number of cases go unreported, as screening of blood and blood products is done primarily by ELISA. Among 124 chronic renal failure (CRF) patients with a history of renal transplant or haemodialysis, 37% were found to be positive for HCV RNA by RT-PCR. We also found a significantly higher rate of transmission of HCV among people exposed to tattooing (2.8%) and pilgrims (5.8%) (slashing a cultural practice in one sect of Muslims). In addition, our studies also reveal a high prevalence of HCV infection (44%) among patients with Lichen planus. The most prevalent genotype observed in our population was 1b (43.4%) followed by 3b (30.2%). The other genotype 1a was observed in 16.6% of patients followed by 3a observed in 3.4% of the patients. Our findings suggest that HCV may be the major cause of post-transplant hepatitis in Indian patients with CRF and indicate the necessity for stringent screening procedures for these viral infections."
2259,0.001,1.0000,"To determine the potential role of the placenta in transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from mother to fetus, the ability of human placental tissue to support HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infection was examined. HIV-1-seronegative first-trimester placentas were maintained in culture and infected with HIV-1. Virus production, measured by HIV-1 antigen release into the supernatant, and HIV-1 DNA, identified by polymerase chain reaction, were detected for at least 12 days postinfection. Western immunoblot analysis showed Gag proteins, precursor p55, and cleavage products p24 and p17 in HIV-1-infected tissues. Double labeling of placental villi with antibodies to CD4 and placental trophoblast-specific alkaline phosphatase indicated that trophoblasts express CD4 antigen. Additionally, immunostaining of HIV-1-infected tissues with anti-p24 antibodies demonstrated HIV-1 protein expression in placental trophoblasts. Evaluation of human chorionic gonadotropin and progesterone production by the placental cultures indicated that there was a 90% decrease in human chorionic gonadotropin and a 70% decrease in progesterone production in HIV-1-infected cultures in comparison with controls. These data demonstrate that trophoblastic cells of human placenta tissue express CD4 and are susceptible to HIV-1 infection; also, placental endocrine function is decreased by HIV-1 infection. Thus, the placenta may serve as a reservoir of HIV-1 infection during pregnancy contributing to infection of the fetus, and decreased placental hormone production may result in impaired fetal development."
4827,0.001,1.0000,"An analysis of the ecological association between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis was undertaken using joint mapping modelling based on data from South African national HIV and syphilis sentinel surveillance surveys carried out between 2007 and 2009. The syphilis prevalence, taken as proxy for sexual behaviour and increased HIV transmission, was first used with health district-level deprivation and population density as a covariate in a HIV prevalence spatial regression model and, secondly, together with HIV as a bivariate outcome. HIV is more highly prevalent in deprived and populated areas than elsewhere, while syphilis has a high prevalence in less deprived and less populated areas. Spatially, the HIV prevalence was lowest in the southwestern and highest in the northeastern parts of the country. This was in discordance to the syphilis prevalence, which revealed negative correlations with HIV prevalence. Considerable variations across the districts remained after adjusting for the contextual covariate factors. Divergent spatial patterns between HIV and syphilis were identified, regarding both observed and unobserved covariate effects. The differential disease-specific spatial prevalence patterns may point to inconsistent successes in interventions between the two diseases. Overall, the results emphasize the need to develop and test plausible aetiological hypotheses relating to ecological correlations and causes of the disease-specific interjectory between the districts."
4339,0.001,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been shown to be effective in different populations, but data among injection drug users are limited. Human immunodeficiency virus-infected injection drug users recruited into the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Link to Intravenous Experiences (ALIVE) Study as early as 1988 were tested semiannually to identify their first CD4-positive T-lymphocyte cell count below 200/microl; they were followed for mortality through 2002. Visits were categorized into the pre-HAART (before mid-1996) and the HAART eras and further categorized by HAART use. Survival analysis with staggered entry was used to evaluate the effect of HAART on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related mortality, adjusting for other medications and demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors. Among 665 participants, 258 died during 2,402 person-years of follow-up. Compared with survival in the pre-HAART era, survival in the HAART era was shown by multivariate analysis to be improved for both those who did and did not receive HAART (relative hazards = 0.06 and 0.33, respectively; p < 0.001). Inferences were unchanged after restricting analyses to data starting with 1993 and considerations of lead-time bias and human immunodeficiency viral load. The annual CD4-positive T-lymphocyte cell decline was less in untreated HAART-era participants than in pre-HAART-era participants (-10/microl vs. -37/microl, respectively), suggesting that changing indications for treatment may have contributed to improved survival and that analyses restricted to the HAART era probably underestimate HAART effectiveness."
5981,0.001,1.0000,"Healthcare workers are at risk of occupationally-acquired viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV). HCV is parenterally transmitted and has been found in every part of the world. This cross-sectional study was conducted to establish the awareness and attitude about HCV infections among 210 full-time and part-time nursing students of the Medical College in Bitola, Macedonia from May to June 2009. For this purpose we used a self-administered questionnaire which consisted of three parts. The first included demographic data, the second included questions about causes of infection, mode of transmission, symptoms, acute and chronic hepatitis, and prevention, and the third questions about students' attitude toward patients with suspect or confirmed HCV infection. Full-time students showed higher HCV awareness (84 %) than part-time students (69 %). 58 % of the full-time and 79 % of the part-time students said they would not avoid professional contact with suspect or HCV infected patients. Our study has shown that even though both groups of students have a sufficient knowledge about HCV to face future challenges, they need further education on the subject. Practical recommendations would help to reduce stigmatising behaviour still further."
9336,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global public health problem that plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the pathogenesis of HBV infection and the mechanisms of host-virus interactions are still elusive. In this study, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry-based comparative proteomics were applied to analyze the host response to HBV using an inducible HBV-producing cell line, HepAD38. Twenty-three proteins were identified as differentially expressed with glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) as one of the most significantly up-regulated proteins induced by HBV replication. This induction was further confirmed in both HepAD38 and HepG2 cells transfected with HBV-producing plasmids by real time RT-PCR and Western blotting as well as in HBV-infected human liver biopsies by immunohistochemistry. Knockdown of GRP78 expression by RNA interference resulted in a significant increase of both intracellular and extracellular HBV virions in the transient HBV-producing HepG2 cells concomitant with enhanced levels of hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen in the culture medium. Conversely overexpression of GRP78 in HepG2 cells led to HBV suppression concomitant with induction of the positive regulatory circuit of GRP78 and interferon-beta1 (IFN-beta1). In this connection, the IFN-beta1-mediated 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase and RNase L signaling pathway was noted to be activated in GRP78-overexpressing HepG2 cells. Moreover GRP78 was significantly down-regulated in the livers of chronic hepatitis B patients after effective anti-HBV treatment (p = 0.019) as compared with their counterpart pretreatment liver biopsies. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that GRP78 functions as an endogenous anti-HBV factor via the IFN-beta1-2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L pathway in hepatocytes. Induction of hepatic GRP78 may provide a novel therapeutic approach in treating HBV infection."

Granuloma inguinale was clinically diagnosed in nine (13.4%) of 67 ulcers negative by M-PCR analysis and in 12 (5.1%) of 237 ulcers positive by M-PCR analysis (P = .03). Lymphogranuloma venereum was clinically diagnosed in eight patients. Compared with M-PCR analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of a clinical diagnosis of syphilis, herpes, and chancroid were 67.7%, 53.8%, and 75% and 91.2%, 83.6%, and 75.4%, respectively. Reactive syphilis serology was 74% sensitive and 85% specific compared with M-PCR analysis. Reported contact with a prostitute in the preceding 3 months was associated with chancroid (P = .009), reactive syphilis serology (P = .011), and HIV infection (P = .007). The relatively poor accuracy of clinical and locally available laboratory diagnoses pleads for syndromic management of genital ulcers in Jamaica. Prevention efforts should be intensified."

Yet few receptors have been characterized in detail and little is known about their complex regulation. In the present study, we investigated the role of the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-related receptor CD244 and of programmed death 1 (PD-1) in HBV infection in 15 acutely and 66 chronically infected patients as well as 9 resolvers and 21 healthy controls. The expression of CD244, PD-1, and T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) was analyzed in virus-specific CD8+ T-cells derived from peripheral blood or liver using major histocompatibility complex class I pentamers targeting immunodominant epitopes of HBV, Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV), or influenza virus (Flu). In chronic HBV infection, virus-specific CD8+ T-cells expressed higher levels of CD244 both in the peripheral blood and liver in comparison to the acute phase of infection or following resolution. CD244 was expressed at similarly high levels in EBV infection, but was low on Flu-specific CD8+ T-cells. In chronic HBV infection, high-level CD244 expression coincided with an increased expression of PD-1. The inhibition of the CD244 signaling pathway by antibodies directed against either CD244 or its ligand CD48 resulted in an increased virus-specific proliferation and cytotoxicity as measured by the expression of CD107a, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α in CD8+ T-cells."
1103,0.001,1.0000,"Although liver transplantation (LTx) in HIV-positive patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been successful, some have reported poorer outcomes in patients coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Here we discuss the impact of recurrent HCV on 27 HIV-positive patients who underwent LTx. HIV infection was well controlled post-transplantation. Survival in HIV-positive/HCV-positive patients was shorter compared to a cohort of HIV-negative/HCV-positive patients matched in age, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, and time of transplant, with cumulative 1-, 3- and 5-year patient survival of 66.7%, 55.6% and 33.3% versus 75.7%, 71.6% and 71.6%, respectively, although not significantly (p = 0.07), and there was a higher likelihood of developing cirrhosis or dying from an HCV-related complication in coinfected subjects (RR = 2.6, 95% CI, 1.06-6.35; p = 0.03). Risk factors for poor survival included African-American race (p = 0.02), MELD score > 20 (p = 0.05), HAART intolerance postLTx (p = 0.01), and postLTx HCV RNA > 30000000 IU/mL (p = 0.00). Recurrent HCV in 18 patients was associated with eight deaths, including three from fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Among surviving coinfected recipients, five are alive at least 3 years after LTx, and of 15 patients treated with interferon-alpha/ribavirin, six (40%) are HCV RNA negative, including four with sustained virological response. Hepatitis C is a major cause of graft loss and patient mortality in coinfected patients undergoing LTx."
7896,0.001,1.0000,"There is evidence that earlier initiation of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with better outcomes, including lower morbidity and mortality. Based on recent studies indicating that Medicaid enrollees are more likely to have suboptimal access to medical care, we hypothesized that HIV severity at time of ART initiation is worse for Medicaid patients than patients with other health care coverage. We conducted a US retrospective analysis of GE Centricity Outpatient Electronic Medical Records spanning 1 January 1997 through 30 September 2009. Subjects included all adult HIV patients initiating first-line ART who had CD4+ results within 90 days pre-initiation. HIV stage was defined using CD4 ranges: >500 (n=520), 351-500 (n=379), 201-350 (n=580), or ≤200 (n=406) cells/mm(3), with lower CD4 count being indicative of increased disease severity. Payer type was defined as the patient's primary payer: Medicaid, Medicare, commercial insurance, self-pay or other/unknown. After controlling for demographic and clinical covariates, cumulative logit models assessed the effect of payer type on HIV stage at ART initiation. The study included 1885 subjects with the primary payer being Medicaid (n=218), Medicare (n=330), commercial insurance (n=538), self-pay (n=159) or other/unknown (n=640). Final logit models demonstrated that, compared to patients on Medicaid, the odds of initiating ART at a higher CD4 range were significantly greater for those commercially insured (odds ratio [OR]=1.53; P=0.005), self-paying (OR=1.56; P=0.023) and other/unknown (OR=1.79; P<0.001) and similar for patients enrolled in Medicare (OR=1.11; P=0.521). Medicaid patients initiated ART at a more advanced stage of HIV than patients who were commercially insured, self-paying, or had other/unknown coverage. With HIV treatment guidelines now supporting ART initiation in patients with higher CD4 counts, these findings underscore the need for mitigating barriers, particularly in the Medicaid population, that may delay treatment initiation.

331,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence and risk factors of hepatitis A, B, and C (HAV, HBV, and HCV) markers were compared in non-Roma and Roma children who lived in a deprived suburb of Athens, Greece. The study included 216 children, 118 Roma and 98 non-Roma of 9 years median age (range 5-15 years). Among Roma children 98.3% had detectable antibodies to HAV, compared with 32.7% among non-Romas (P < 0.0001). Regarding HBV, 22% Roma children were identified with evidence of past infection (anti-HBc(+)), among whom five (4% of the total) were chronic carriers (HBsAg(+)), whereas no past infection was detected among the non-Romas (P < 0.0001). Markers of past HBV vaccination (anti-HBs(+), anti-HBc(-)) were detected in only 14% Roma but 96% non-Roma children (P-value < 0.0001). There was some indication for intrafamilial transmission of HAV and HBV in Roma school children. Unfavorable living conditions, frequent residency change, lack of child insurance and primary healthcare delivery were significantly associated with seroprevalence of HBV infection among Romas. No child in either group was found positive for HCV markers. These findings document high socioeconomic differentials with regards to preventable communicable diseases, such as HAV and HBV and underline the need for enhancing health policy action targeting pockets of minority childhood populations. Whereas, uptake of HBV vaccination is rather optimal in this general population, the high seroprevalence of HAV among Romas, also calls for implementing general vaccination for HAV, early in life."
309,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in subjects coinfected with HIV. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) are licensed for the treatment of HIV-1 and HBV infection, respectively, but both have in vivo and in vitro activity against HBV. This study evaluated the anti-HBV activity of TDF compared to ADV in HIV/HBV-coinfected subjects. ACTG A5127 was a prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of daily 10 mg of ADV versus 300 mg of TDF in subjects with HBV and HIV coinfection on stable ART, with serum HBV DNA >/= 100,000 copies/mL, and plasma HIV-1 RNA </= 10,000 copies/mL. This study closed early based on results of a prespecified interim review, as the primary noninferiority end point had been met without safety issues. Fifty-two subjects were randomized. At baseline, 73% of subjects had a plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, 86% were HBeAg positive, 94% were 3TC resistant, median serum ALT was 52 IU/L, and 98% had compensated liver disease. The mean time-weighted average change in serum HBV DNA from baseline to week 48 (DAVG(48)) was -4.44 log(10) copies/mL for TDF and -3.21 log(10) copies/mL for ADV. There was no difference in toxicity between the 2 treatment arms, with 11 subjects (5 ADV and 6 TDF) experiencing elevations of serum ALT on treatment. In conclusion, over 48 weeks, treatment with either ADV or TDF resulted in clinically important suppression of serum HBV DNA. Both drugs are safe and efficacious for patients coinfected with HBV and HIV."
1622,0.001,1.0000,"In sub-Saharan Africa, the Pacific, and particularly Asia, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly endemic, the most common route of transmission is perinatal. To minimize the number of horizontal transmissions, we determined the prevalence of HBV genotypes among children in northern Thailand. From a survey of 1,231 schoolchildren in Chiang Mai during 1998 to 2000, 55 (4.5%) were found positive for HBsAg. Fifty-three HBsAg-positive samples were available for this study. These came from 28 girls (52.8%) and 25 boys (47.2%), age 5-16 years, with a mean age of 12.8 (+/-2.6) years. The laboratory method was based on a multiplex-PCR for the detection of 6 HBV genotypes (A-F). Among 53 HBsAg positive cases, 48 (90.6%) were genotype C, followed by 4 cases of genotype B (7.5%), and 1 case (1.9%) with mixed infection with genotypes B and C. The high prevalence of HBV genotype C follow by genotype B is similar to that found among blood donors in northern Thailand and the nationwide epidemiological survey conducted in 2004. Perinatal transmission may play an important role in the spread of the virus in this area, as in other Asian countries, where genotypes C and B are highly prevalent."
9007,0.001,1.0000,"We hypothesized that rapid presentation may be a general feature of tuberculosis (TB) associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that limits the impact of HIV on the point prevalence of TB. To investigate this, we performed a cross-sectional HIV and TB disease survey with retrospective and prospective follow-up. HIV prevalence among 1,773 systematically recruited miners was 27%. TB incidence was much more strongly HIV associated (incidence rate ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-8.6) than the point prevalence of undiagnosed TB disease (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9-3.3). For smear-positive TB, 7 of 9 (78%) prevalent cases were HIV negative, and point prevalence was nonsignificantly lower in miners who were HIV positive (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1-4.2). The calculated mean duration of smear positivity before diagnosis (point prevalence/incidence) was substantially shorter for HIV-positive than HIV-negative TB patients (0.17 and 1.15 years, respectively; ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.00-0.73). HIV has considerably less impact on the point prevalence of TB disease than on TB incidence, probably because rapid disease progression increases presentation and case-finding rates. The difference in mean duration of smear positivity was particularly marked and, if generalizable, will have major implications for TB control prospects in high HIV prevalence areas."
6744,0.001,1.0000,"In order to determine the current prevalence and incidence of fluconazole-resistant oropharyngeal candidiasis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, we conducted a prospective observational study of a consecutive series of HIV-infected patients. Of 128 enrolled patients, 70 patients completed four quarterly follow-up visits over a period of 1 year. Over this period, declining rates of carriage of Candida albicans (from 61% to 39%; P = .008) and of oropharyngeal candidiasis (from 30% to 4%; P < .001) were documented. Trends toward reduction in the frequency of fluconazole-resistant isolates (MIC, > or = 64 micrograms/mL) were also seen. During the survey period, the mean (median) number of antiretroviral agents used per patient rose from 0.5 (0) to 1.8 (2) (P < .001). Thus, rather than progression, we observed declining rates of oropharyngeal candidiasis, C. albicans carriage, and fluconazole-resistant C. albicans in a cohort of HIV-infected patients treated with increasingly effective antiretroviral therapy."
9214,0.001,1.0000,"The development of an effective maternal HIV-1 vaccine that could synergize with antiretroviral therapy (ART) to eliminate pediatric HIV-1 infection will require the characterization of maternal immune responses capable of blocking transmission of autologous HIV to the infant. We previously determined that maternal plasma antibody binding to linear epitopes within the variable loop 3 (V3) region of HIV envelope (Env) and neutralizing responses against easy-to-neutralize tier 1 viruses were associated with reduced risk of peripartum HIV infection in the historic U.S. Woman and Infant Transmission Study (WITS) cohort. Here, we defined the fine specificity and function of the potentially protective maternal V3-specific IgG antibodies associated with reduced peripartum HIV transmission risk in this cohort. The V3-specific IgG binding that predicted low risk of mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) was dependent on the C-terminal flank of the V3 crown and particularly on amino acid position 317, a residue that has also been associated with breakthrough transmission in the RV144 vaccine trial. Remarkably, the fine specificity of potentially protective maternal plasma V3-specific tier 1 virus-neutralizing responses was dependent on the same region in the V3 loop. Our findings suggest that MTCT risk is associated with neutralizing maternal IgG that targets amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of the V3 loop crown, suggesting the importance of the region in immunogen design for maternal vaccines to prevent MTCT."
7766,0.001,1.0000,"Although human eosinophils express low concentrations of CD4, the capacity of mature, non-replicating eosinophils to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) has not been established. Using peripheral blood eosinophils isolated free of contaminating lymphocytes and mononuclear leukocytes, we evaluated eosinophil infection with HIV-1. Eosinophils could be infected with strains of HIV-1 as evidenced by HIV-induced cytolytic effects, progressive release of p24 antigen in cultures of infected eosinophils, recovery of HIV from infected eosinophils by co-cultivation, and detection of HIV-1 gag viral DNA from infected eosinophils by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Greater p24 antigen release from infected eosinophils was elicited by the phorbol ester, PMA; and eosinophil killing by HIV-1 was enhanced by the cytokine GM-CSF. By light and electron microscopy, HIV-infected eosinophils demonstrated apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptotic subdiploid nuclear staining was detected by flow cytometric analyses of propidium iodide-stained nuclei from HIV-infected eosinophils, and DNA isolated from HIV-infected eosinophils showed both nucleosomal fragmentation and diffuse degradation. Thus, mature eosinophils, non-replicating terminally differentiated leukocytes, can be infected with HIV-1. HIV-1 expression in eosinophils is promoted by increased granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and can cause eosinophils to undergo death due to apoptosis and necrosis."

Analysis of HIV virus load excluded any 0. 5 log10 increase due to sargramostim (95% confidence interval, -0.68 to 0.44). Sargramostim was well tolerated, and inflammatory cytokines and surrogate markers of disease progression, such as serum levels of interleukin-10 and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors types Iota and IotaIota, remained stable in subjects receiving sargramostim. Sargramostim treatment was associated with a trend toward decreased HIV RNA (>0.5 log10) and increased CD4+ cell count (>30%). These results became statistically significant only when subjects with baseline virus loads within the limits of detection or baseline CD4 cell count >50 were analyzed.

The frequency and level of intrapartum mucosal exposure to HIV-1 of 22 infants born to infected mothers was investigated. Maternal plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count were measured at delivery. Infant oropharyngeal aspirates obtained at birth were examined for HIV-1 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and qualitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. Nine infants (41%) had detectable levels of HIV-1 RNA, 3 of which were quantifiable (mean, 3000 copies/mL). This mucosal exposure to HIV-1 during delivery did not lead to infection of any infant. Cesarian delivery did not reduce mucosal exposure to HIV-1. Mucosal exposure did not correlate with maternal CD4 cell count but did correlate with maternal plasma virus load and was reduced by antiretroviral therapy."
2224,0.001,1.0000,"CXCR4 is the major co-receptor used by X4 strains of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). In HIV-1-infected patients, the appearance of X4 strains (T cell line-tropic) correlates with disease progression. Since its discovery, the CXCR4 co-receptor has been a major target for different agents which block its function, such as stromal-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) and the anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody, 12G5. In the present studies, the 12G5 hybridoma was used to construct a single-chain variable antibody fragment (SFv). Murine leukemia virus (MLV) and simian virus 40 (SV(40)) were utilized as delivery vehicles for the anti-CXCR4 SFv. Intracellular expression of the anti-CXCR4 SFv led to down-regulation of this critical co-receptor, as demonstrated by immunostaining. This effect significantly and specifically protected transduced cells from challenge with HIV-1, as measured by HIV-1 p24 antigen expression. Inhibition of HIV-1 replication was specific for X4 HIV-1 strains as demonstrated by MAGI assays. HeLa-CD4/betagal-CCR5 cells expressing the anti-CXCR4 SFv showed significant inhibition of infectivity by the X4 HIV-1 strain NL4-3, but not with the R5 HIV-1 strain Bal. Thus, this anti-HIV-1 molecular therapy has the potential to inhibit HIV-1 replication and virion spread. Targeting CXCR4 by intracellular immunization could be of additional benefit to certain HIV-1-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)."

In 2014, the prevalence of HIV infection among persons aged 15-49 years was 24.6%, with an incidence of 1.9 new infections per 100 person-years of exposure (3). As the leading cause of premature death, HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) has contributed to Lesotho's reporting the shortest life expectancy at birth among 195 countries and territories (4). In 2015, antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage among HIV-positive persons in Lesotho was estimated to be 42% (5). In April 2016, Lesotho became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to adopt the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for universal initiation of antiretroviral therapy for all HIV-positive persons, regardless of CD4 count (known as the ""Test and Start"" program or approach), with nationwide implementation occurring in June 2016 (6,7).

3952,0.001,1.0000,"A number of clinical trials have explored the optimal dosage for antiretroviral therapy and, in various ways, the optimal time, in terms of stage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, at which treatment should begin. Some studies have shown that treatment with zidovudine results in a delay in progression to more advanced stages of HIV disease, and that the benefits are more durable among persons who started zidovudine with higher CD4+ cell counts. Efficacy is preserved and toxicity is reduced when zidovudine is used at dosages lower than those originally recommended. The Concorde study found that administration of zidovudine to asymptomatic persons was associated with increases in CD4+ cell counts and improvement in delaying disease progression at 55 weeks, but found no correlation between time of initiation of therapy and either longer-term delay in onset of symptomatic disease or ultimate survival. The analysis of these results, however, is complicated because of premature crossover of study participants from deferred treatment to immediate treatment. The consensus of the discussants of these studies is that antiretroviral treatment should be initiated by the time the CD4+ cell count has fallen to 200-500 cells/mm3. Although recognizing that, in general, viral infections call for treatment, the panelists were divided in their opinions about treatment of asymptomatic patients with CD4+ cell counts > 500/mm3."

We examined the efficiency of transduction and transgene expression in adult bone marrow (BM)- and umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived CD34+ cells induced to differentiate into T cells and monocytes in vitro with an MuLV-based vector encoding the neomycin resistance gene and an intracellular antibody directed against the Tat protein of HIV-1 (sFvtat1-Ckappa). The expression of the marker gene and the effects of antiviral construct on subsequent challenge with monocytotropic and T cell-tropic HIV-1 isolates were monitored in vitro in purified T cells and monocytes generated in culture from the transduced CD34+ cells. Transduction efficiencies of CD34+ cells ranged between 22 and 27%. Differentiation of CD34+ cells into T cells or monocytes was not significantly altered by the transduction process. HIV-1 replication in monocytes and CD4+ T cells derived from CD34+ cells transduced with the intracellular antibody gene was significantly reduced in comparison with the degree of HIV replication seen in monocytes and CD4+ T cells derived from CD34+ cells transduced with the neomycin resistance gene alone. Further, T cells and monocytes derived from CD34+ cells transduced with the intracellular antibody gene were demonstrated to express the sFvtat1-Ckappa transgene by RT-PCR and had a selective growth advantage in cultures that had been challenged with HIV-1. These data demonstrate that sFvtat1-Ckappa inhibits HIV-1 replication in T cells and monocytes developing from CD34+ cells and supports the continuing development of a stem cell gene therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection."

However, the ageing of patients leads to an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease. Various studies have found that pharmaceutical care results in better control of cardiovascular risk factors. Objective To measure the impact of pharmaceutical care on cardiovascular risk in patients older than 50 years receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Setting Outpatient pharmacy service of a tertiary hospital, Spain. Methods A pre/post-intervention quasi-experimental clinical study was conducted in which health education and pharmacist interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk factors were carried out in a single patient cohort using the Dader method of pharmacotherapy, with a 12-month follow-up period per patient. Patients included were older than 50 years, with moderate/elevated cardiovascular risk. Data were obtained from patient clinical histories, dispensing records and patient interviews, and were subjected to statistical analysis. Main outcome measure Cardiovascular risk estimated by SCORE and REGICOR equations. Results Forty-two patients completed the study. Of these, 93 % were men, with an average age of 57 years and 15 years since diagnosis of HIV. A reduction was observed in the mean values (baseline vs. 12 months) of the following cardiovascular risk factors: systolic blood pressure (P = 0.009), diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.010), total cholesterol (P = 0.006), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c; P = 0.039), triglycerides (P = 0.010) and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c; P < 0.001). An increase in HDL-c (P = 0.037) was also observed. The average cardiovascular risk estimated by the SCORE instrument was reduced from 7.6 % at the beginning of the study to 6.4 % after 12 months (P = 0.039). The risk estimate according to REGICOR also decreased (P = 0.002). Over the 12-month period, 6.3 ± 3.4 interventions were carried out per patient. Quantitative ineffectiveness was the most prevalent negative outcome associated with medication throughout the study, and noncompliance was the most frequent cause. Interventions on health education were the most common, followed by interventions on improving adherence. Conclusion Pharmaceutical care, delivered as a combination of health education and pharmacotherapy follow-up to outpatients at a tertiary hospital, had a positive impact on cardiovascular risk in patients older than 50 years receiving combination antiretroviral therapy."

Subjects 6-17 years of age and their primary caregivers were recruited from 29 International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials sites in the USA and Puerto Rico. A total of 576 children (320 HIV and 256 HIV- children) were enrolled from June 2005 to September 2006. Subject self-reports of pain were measured by the Wong-Baker visual analog scale and Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire. Symptomatology for anxiety, depression, and dysthymia was assessed through Symptom Inventory instruments. Caregiver's assessment of their child's pain and psychiatric symptomatology was similarly measured. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate predictors of pain. We found that a higher proportion of HIV-infected than uninfected subjects reported pain in the last two months (41% vs 32%, p=0.04), last two weeks (28% vs 19%, p=0.02), and lasting more than one week (20% vs 11%, p=0.03). Among HIV-infected youth, females (OR=1.53, p=0.09), White race (OR=2.15, p=0.04), and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Class C (OR=1.83, p=0.04) were significantly more likely to report pain. For all subjects, only 52% of caregivers recognized their child's pain and just 22% were aware that pain affected their child's daily activities. The odds of reported pain in HIV increased with higher symptom severity for generalized anxiety (OR=1.14, p=0.03), major depression (OR=1.15, p=0.03), and dysthymia (OR=1.18, p=0.01). This study underscores the importance of queries concerning pain and emotional stressors in the care of HIV and uninfected children exposed to HIV individuals. The discordance between patient and caregiver reports of pain and its impact on activities of daily living highlights that pain in children is under-recognized and therefore potentially under-treated."
5235,0.001,1.0000,"Few patients with osteonecrosis that complicates human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been reported. We describe 5 patients whose symptoms of osteonecrosis developed with viral suppression and improvement in CD4 lymphocyte counts as a result of antiretroviral therapy. In addition, we review previously reported cases. The mean patient age was 35 years, and HIV was the sole risk factor in only 33%. Eighteen patients (55%) were receiving antiretroviral treatment when osteonecrosis was diagnosed. For 16 patients whose CD4 lymphocyte counts were reported, the mean CD4 count was 350 cells/mm(3). In 10 of these patients, the occurrence or worsening of symptoms of osteonecrosis appeared to be related to successful antiretroviral therapy. We conclude that osteonecrosis is an emerging manifestation of HIV infection and that it may be either a consequence of immunologic and virologic improvement resulting from antiretroviral therapy or a complication caused by the drugs themselves."

Although viral antigens are not expressed in cultured cells until 14 days postinfection, cytolytic activity was lost as early as 3 days after infection. Loss of cytolytic function was not a result of the release of suppressive factors from either infected cells or uninfected CEM cells since supernatants from neither infected cultures nor CEM cell cultures had any inhibitory effects on the function of uninfected cells. Cultured lymphocytes expressing Leu 11b were also shown to express HIV antigens via immunofluorescence after 14 days in culture. These results suggest that natural killer (NK) cells, as defined by expression of Leu 11b, were infected by HIV in vitro and the loss of lytic function was likely a direct consequence of that infection."
9916,0.001,1.0000,"Humanized mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic cells have been developed as an experimental animal model for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Myeloablative irradiation is usually performed to augment the engraftment of donor hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in recipient mice; however, some mouse strains are susceptible to irradiation, making longitudinal analysis difficult. We previously attempted to construct humanized NOD/SCID/JAK3(null) (hNOJ) mice, which were not irradiated prior to human HSC transplantation. We found that, over time, many of the reconstituted CD4(+) T cells expanded with an activated effector memory phenotype. Therefore, the present study used hNOJ mice that were irradiated (hNOJ (IR+)) or not (hNOJ (IR-)) prior to human HSC transplantation to examine whether the development and cellularity of the reconstituted CD4(+) T cells were influenced by the degree of chimerism, and whether they affected HIV-1 infectivity. Indeed, hNOJ (IR+) mice showed a greater degree of chimerism than hNOJ (IR-) mice. However, the conversion of CD4(+) T cells to an activated effector memory phenotype, with a high percentage of cells showing Ki-67 expression, occurred in both hNOJ (IR+) and hNOJ (IR-) mice, probably as a result of lymphopenia-induced homeostatic expansion. Furthermore, when hNOJ (IR+) and hNOJ (IR-) mice, which were selected as naïve- and memory CD4(+) T cell subset-rich groups, respectively, were infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 in vivo, virus replication (as assessed by the plasma viral load) was delayed; however, the titer subsequently reached a 1-log higher level in memory-rich hNOJ (IR-) mice than in naïve-rich hNOJ (IR+) mice, indicating that virus infectivity in hNOJ mice was affected by the different status of the reconstituted CD4(+) T cells. Therefore, the hNOJ mouse model should be used selectively, i.e., according to the specific experimental objectives, to gain an appropriate understanding of HIV-1 infection/pathogenesis."
2634,0.001,1.0000,"We comparatively analyzed the replication kinetics of wild-type (wt) and nef mutant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in several CD4-positive cell lines, in order to clarify the molecular function of Nef protein. The delayed growth of nef mutant virus was observed at the initial stage of replication in all cell lines examined. This phenomenon was greatly amplified in the absence of vpu gene. In order to determine the infection stage in viral replication cycle which is specifically affected on virus replication rate in the presence of the Nef protein, we first examined the difference between wt and nef mutant viruses in the virus production rate from transfected cells, and found that the both viruses were produced with equal efficiency. This result showed that Nef protein could be dispensable for virion production. Therefore, early infection stages were focused by single-round infection assay, and the nef mutant virus was found to be much less infectious than wt virus. This indicated that the effect of Nef protein was exhibited in the early phase of a virus replication cycle, during viral adsorption to integration. By entry assay using wt and nef mutant virions, it was revealed that the Nef protein was required for efficient viral entry. These data suggest that the Nef protein might play a role in efficient incorporation of the Env protein into the virions, leading to enhanced viral infectivity."
270,0.001,1.0000,"Several lines of evidence suggest that Fas-mediated apoptosis is involved in the CD4 T-cell depletion in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. To investigate this, we studied changes in peripheral blood, early T-cell apoptosis and Fas expression after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 18 HIV-1-infected individuals. Flow cytometric analysis was performed with Apostain and CD4, CD8 and Fas staining. Fas expression was quantified by standardized beads. The levels of CD4 and CD8 T cells with early apoptosis were increased comparably in HIV-1-infected individuals. Despite elevated CD4 T cell counts, no decline in early T-cell apoptosis could be detected during the first 8 weeks of ART. However, after 26 weeks of ART in five patients that showed a sustained reduction of viral replication there was a marked decrease in T cells with features of early apoptosis. No difference was found for Fas expression on early apoptotic T cells. Fas expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells was reduced after initiation of ART; this was independent of the CD4 T-cell trend and indicates that the immediate CD4 T-cell expansion during ART is probably not the result of a decreased rate of early apoptosis among peripheral blood CD4 T cells. However, preliminary data imply a long-term reduction of early T-cell apoptosis and Fas expression in patients who show a sustained reduction of viral replication."
4693,0.001,1.0000,"Opiate-abusing individuals are in the top three risk-factor groups for HIV infection. In fact, almost 30% of HIV-infected individuals in the USA are reported to abuse opiates, highlighting the intersection of drugs of abuse with HIV/AIDS. Opiate-abusers are cognitively impaired and suffer from neurological dysfunctions that may lead to high-risk sexual behavior, poor adherence to antiretroviral regimens, and hepatitis-C virus infection. Collectively, these factors may contribute to accelerated HIV central nervous system (CNS) disease progression. To understand the role of morphine in disease progression, we sought to determine whether morphine influences HIV-induced inflammation or viral replication in human monocyte-derived macrophages (h-mdms) and MAGI cells infected with HIV and exposed to morphine. Chronic morphine exposure of HIV-infected h-mdms led to significant alterations in the secretion of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (MCP-2). Morphine enhanced IL-6 secretion and blunted MCP-2 secretion from HIV-infected h-mdms. However, exposure of HIV-infected h-mdms to morphine had no effect on tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion. Morphine had no effect on later stages of viral replication in HIV-infected h-mdms. Morphine had a potentially additive effect on the HIV-induced production of IL-6 and delayed HIV-induced MCP-2 production. These results suggest that in HIV-infected opiate-abusers, enhanced CNS inflammation might result even when HIV disease is controlled."
4549,0.001,1.0000,"Intensive chemotherapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) has resulted in durable remissions in a substantial proportion of patients. High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (AuSCT), moreover, has resulted in sustained complete remissions in selected patients with recurrent chemosensitive disease. Based on a favorable experience with dose-reduced high-dose busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and AuSCT for older patients with non-HIV-associated aggressive lymphomas, an AIDS Malignancy Consortium multicenter trial was undertaken using the same dose-reduced busulfan and cyclophosphamide preparative regimen with AuSCT for recurrent HIV-associated NHL and HL. Of the 27 patients in the study, 20 received an AuSCT. The median time to achievement of an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of >or= 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 11 days (range, 9-16 days). The median time to achievement of an unsupported platelet count of >or= 20 x 10(9)/L was 13 days (range, 6-57 days). One patient died on day +33 posttransplantation from hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and multiorgan failure. No other fatal regimen-related toxicity occurred. Ten of 19 patients (53%) were in complete remission at the time of their day +100 post-AuSCT evaluation. Of the 20 patients, 10 were alive and event-free at a median of 23 weeks post-AuSCT. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached by 13 of the 20 patients alive at the time of last follow-up. This multi-institutional trial demonstrates that a regimen of dose-reduced high-dose busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and AuSCT is well tolerated and is associated with favorable disease-free survival (DFS) and OS probabilities for selected patients with HIV-associated NHL and HL."
7543,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the central nervous system (CNS) can lead to the development of HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD). We examined the virological characteristics of HIV-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of HAD subjects to explore the association between independent viral replication in the CNS and the development of overt dementia. We found that genetically compartmentalized CCR5-tropic (R5) T cell-tropic and macrophage-tropic HIV-1 populations were independently detected in the CSF of subjects diagnosed with HIV-1-associated dementia. Macrophage-tropic HIV-1 populations were genetically diverse, representing established CNS infections, while R5 T cell-tropic HIV-1 populations were clonally amplified and associated with pleocytosis. R5 T cell-tropic viruses required high levels of surface CD4 to enter cells, and their presence was correlated with rapid decay of virus in the CSF with therapy initiation (similar to virus in the blood that is replicating in activated T cells). Macrophage-tropic viruses could enter cells with low levels of CD4, and their presence was correlated with slow decay of virus in the CSF, demonstrating a separate long-lived cell as the source of the virus. These studies demonstrate two distinct virological states inferred from the CSF virus in subjects diagnosed with HAD. Finally, macrophage-tropic viruses were largely restricted to the CNS/CSF compartment and not the blood, and in one case we were able to identify the macrophage-tropic lineage as a minor variant nearly two years before its expansion in the CNS. These results suggest that HIV-1 variants in CSF can provide information about viral replication and evolution in the CNS, events that are likely to play an important role in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders."
5468,0.001,1.0000,"A bacteriophage lambda-based method was used to investigate the development of resistance to protease inhibitors (PI) in one subject infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 group O who underwent multiple treatment regimens over a period of 4 years. A reduction in the susceptibility to indinavir of 6-fold and a reduction in the susceptibility to saquinavir of 24-fold were recognized after long exposure to these drugs with respect to baseline. The emergence of PI resistance corresponded to the selection of amino acid changes L10V, G48M, F53L, I54V, and L90M at the protease. The results were concordant with those obtained by a drug susceptibility assay with primary HIV isolates."
2357,0.001,1.0000,"VprR77Q has been associated with long-term nonprogressive (LTNP) HIV infection. We wished to investigate the prevalence, clinical correlates, and effect on treatment response of VprR77Q in a cohort of antiretroviral- naïve individuals initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Baseline plasma samples from 728 subjects were genotyped using RT-PCR and direct DNA sequencing. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the effects of VprR77Q on virologic and immunologic responses, and survival following initiation of HAART, over a median 4.5 years follow-up. We found that 308 subjects (42.3%) harbored VprR77Q alone or in combination with another amino acid, while 420 (57.7%) harbored an amino acid other than Q. A cross-sectional analysis found no correlation between R77Q and baseline plasma viral load (pVL), CD4 count, diagnosis of AIDS, or sociodemographic characteristics including age, gender, and history of injection drug use (p > 0.1). In multivariate analyses, no significant associations between VprR77Q and initial pVL and CD4 responses to HAART or survival following initiation of treatment were observed (p > 0.1). The high prevalence and the lack of association with pretherapy clinical parameters in this cohort argue against an association of R77Q with LTNP status. These results do not support an association between R77Q and HAART response."
57,0.001,1.0000,"We wished to undertake molecular characterization of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene and overlapping surface (S) gene in lamivudine-treated patients with chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sequencing analyses of the HBV RT/S gene of isolates from 25 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with the YMDD mutation and 30 treatment-naïve CHB patients were undertaken. In patients with the YMDD mutation, rtM2041 was the major type of mutation (20/25, 80%). rtL80I was present in most of the patients with rtM204I (14/20, 70%). rtL180M coexisted with rtM204V (5/5, 100%). Patients with the YMDD mutation had a significantly higher prevalence of mutation of the RT gene than treatment-naïve CHB patients (P < 0.05). Classical primary resistance and secondary/compensatory mutations were detected at only five sites (rtL80, rtV173, rtL180, rtM204, rtM250) in CHB patients with the YMDD mutation. The frequency of nucleos(t)ide analog resistance (NAr) mutation within the RT gene in patients with the YMDD mutation was significantly higher than that in treatment-naïve patients (P < 0.05). Amino-acid mutations within the RT gene were also associated with other types of NAr in patients with the YMDD mutation. The rate of amino-acid variants within the S gene region was significantly higher in patients with the YMDD mutation than that in treatment-naïve patients (P < 0.05). sM133L and sG145R variants were also present in patients with the YMDD mutation. These observations suggest that CHB patients with the YMDD mutation also have NAr mutations related to other NA drugs, which might lead to cross-resistance in CHB patients. Variants present in the S gene region could cause changes in the antigenicity of HBsAg, which could result in a false-negative diagnosis of HBsAg and immune in escape of the HBV."
7032,0.001,1.0000,"Nucleoside analog-based regimens remain an integral component of combination therapy for use in both antiretroviral treatment-naive and experienced HIV-infected patients. To further define treatment responses to new antiretroviral therapy in patients with long-term experience to dual nucleoside analog therapy (zidovudine [ZDV] plus didanosine [ddI] or ZDV plus zalcitabine [ddC]), 325 subjects derived from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 175 trial were randomized to three different combination regimens: (1) continuation of ZDV + ddI or ZDV + ddC (continuation arm), (2) addition of 3TC to ZDV + ddI or ZDV + ddC (addition arm), or (3) a switch to ZDV + 3TC therapy (switch arm). Both the addition and switch arms sustained significantly greater short-term (baseline to week 4) mean CD4+ cell count increases compared with the continuation arm (+36, +28 versus -4 cells/mm3; p = 0.012) and long-term CD4+ cell count responses (baseline to weeks 40/48: +32, +19 versus -9 cells/mm3; p = 0.003). Superior short-term (baseline to week 8) mean decreases in plasma HIV RNA (p < 0.001) were achieved by both the addition and switch arms (0.53 log10 and 0.54 log10 copies/ml, respectively) compared with the continuation arm (0.13 copies/ml) whereas no differences in long-term virologic suppression were observed (p = 0.30). At week 48, no differences were observed in the proportions of subjects who had HIV RNA levels below 500 copies/mL: 18% of subjects in each treatment arm (3-way p = 1.0). Overall, the treatments were well tolerated and only nine subjects (3%) died or developed one or more AIDS-defining events. While this study confirms the intrinsic antiretroviral activity of 3TC, only modest marker changes and limited short-term viral suppression are seen with incremental addition of the drug. The current approach of using 3TC in maximally suppressive regimens is preferred."

The CC genotype at rs12979860 of the IL28B is associated with greater rates of spontaneous clearance of HCV and response to antiviral therapy. IL28B acts on the interferon-stimulated genes through the JAK-STAT pathway, which is related to the development of insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate whether IL28B rs12979860 polymorphism is associated with the development of NODAT after LT for cirrhosis owing to HCV infection."
8559,0.001,1.0000,"This study investigates fasting serum levels of methionine and related metabolites, vitamin B6, and folate during highly active antiretroviral therapy in therapy-naive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected outpatients. The research design consisted of before and during therapy measurements with a median treatment period of 100 days (range, 50 to 188) in frozen samples. The subjects included 17 consecutive HIV-1-infected outpatients (15 men and 2 women; 25 to 65-years-old). Controls were 42 healthy individuals (28 men and 14 women; 24- to 82-years-old) without serologic evidence of HIV and/or hepatitis C infection and normal clinical chemistry. Subjects received treatment with the reverse transcriptase inhibitors, azidothymidine (AZT) or stavudine (D4T) plus lamivudine (3TC) and either the protease inhibitors, indinavir (IND), nelfinavir (NELF), ritonavir (RITV), or saquinavir (SAQ) at the standard dosage. Serum concentrations of methionine, total homocysteine (tHcy), cystathionine (CYSTA), N,N-dimethylglycine (DMG), N-methylglycine (MG), methylmalonic acid (MMA), and total cysteine, as well as vitamin B6, folate, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor p75 were taken at baseline and during highly active antiretroviral therapy. Baseline, serum tHcy, MMA, CYSTA, vitamin B6 concentrations were not significantly different from healthy controls. There was, however, a trend towards lower folate serum concentrations at baseline in HIV-infected patients as compared with healthy controls (P =.06). There were no significant correlations between tHcy and vitamin B6, folate, or MMA. Elevated baseline levels of DMG and MG decreased significantly during antiretroviral therapy (P =.0019 and.04, respectively), whereas no significant changes in serum concentrations of CYSTA, MMA, or methionine were detected. tHcy increased in 12 of 17 patients (P =.09). HIV-infected patients displayed significant alterations (elevated DMG and MG serum concentrations) in metabolite levels of the betaine pathway in methionine metabolism, which might be positively influenced by newly initiated antiretroviral combination therapy."
4417,0.001,1.0000,"Reverse transcriptase (RT) is a multifunctional enzyme in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 life cycle and represents a primary target for drug discovery efforts against HIV-1 infection. Two classes of RT inhibitors, the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) and the nonnucleoside transcriptase inhibitors are prominently used in the highly active antiretroviral therapy in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. However, the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viral strains has limited the successful rate of the anti-HIV agents. Computational methods are a significant part of the drug design process and indispensable to study drug resistance. In this review, recent advances in computer-aided drug design for the rational design of new compounds against HIV-1 RT using methods such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics, free energy calculations, quantitative structure-activity relationships, pharmacophore modelling and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity prediction are discussed. Successful applications of these methodologies are also highlighted. "
2952,0.001,1.0000,"Antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infected children. However, development of ARV resistance in these children is a major public health problem due to lack of availability of and access to new drugs. This study was conducted in order to identify circulating HIV subtypes and recombinant forms and evaluate the drug resistance mutation patterns in 18 HIV-1 infected children failing ARV treatment in Kelantan, Malaysia. Genotyping for codon 1-99 of protease (PR) and 1-250 of reverse transcriptase (RT) were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing. Subsequently, these were phylogenetically analyzed to determine the subtypes. CRF33_01B (44.4%) was found to be the predominant HIV subtype, followed by B (27.8%), CRF15_01B (16.7%) and CRF01_AE (11.1%) subtypes. The most prevalent RT mutations were T215F/V/Y (66.7%), D67G/N (55.6%), K219Q/E/R (44.4%), M184V/I (38.9%), K70R/E (27.8%) and M41L (27.8%), associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) resistance; and K103N (55.6%), G190A (33.3%), and K101P/E/H (27.8%) associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) resistance. The results showed a possible emergence of CRF33_01B as current predominant subtypes/circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), and a high frequency of primary mutations among HIV-1 infected children after failure of ARV therapy in Kelantan, Malaysia."
6636,0.001,1.0000,"Entecavir (ETV) demonstrates potent antiviral effects against lamivudine (LMV)-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV). This study was designed to investigate the impact of LMV resistance mutations on the outcome of ETV rescue therapy in LMV-refractory patients. Twenty-six chronic hepatitis B patients who received ETV monotherapy for LMV resistance were enrolled. Dynamics of HBV DNA levels were monitored before and during ETV rescue therapy. Mutations in the HBV reverse transcriptase were examined by sequencing. LMV-resistant mutations (rtL180M and/or rtM204VI) were detected in 9 patients before ETV treatment and not in another 5 patients before and after the treatment. ETV therapy resulted in a greater reduction in the HBV DNA load in the patients with out LMV-associated mutations before treatment than in those with. Six patients with 100% LMV-resistant HBV variants at week 12 posttreatment had significantly (P<0.01) greater HBV DNA levels at the end of follow-up than the other patients studied. A comparable outcome was achieved between the patients with or without emergence of LMV-resistant mutations during the ETV treatment. In conclusion, patients without 100% LMV-resistant HBV mutants at week 12 and those without LMV-resistant mutations before treatment show a better response to ETV rescue therapy than the corresponding others. Therefore, individual treatment optimization is of significance in improving the efficacy of antiviral therapy for patients with chronic HBV infection."

Informations were collected from an electronic medical record of all HIV- 1-infected patients who sought care in six HIV reference centers in France, constituting a prospective multicentric cohort. Patients were defined as ""late testers"" if they had presented with either symptoms of clinical AIDS or a CD4 cell count less than 200/mm(3) during the year of diagnosis, as ""nonlate"" if their CD4 count was above 200, and as ""unknown"" if CD4 cell count in the year at the time of diagnosis was not documented. Among the 4516 patients available for analysis, the percentage of late testing was 38% (n = 1718) and decreased after 2003 (31.5% in 2004-2005). This percentage was higher in heterosexual men (48.2%) than in homosexual men (31.7%) or heterosexual women (32.6%) and was higher for patients older than 30. Heterosexual men living in a couple with children had a higher risk of late testing (odds ratio [OR] = 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 2.66), while heterosexual women in a couple without children had a lower risk (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.83). Among homosexual men, unemployment was associated with late testing (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.14 to 4.36). The proportion of late testing was still high. Groups classically identified as low risk for HIV infection, particularly heterosexual men in a couple with children, were found to be at high risk for late testing. It seems necessary to improve HIV testing policy in the heterosexual population."
5222,0.001,1.0000,"There are limited data on the efficacy of T cell-based assays to detect tuberculosis (TB) antigen-specific responses in immune-deficient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in patients with HIV-1 infection, especially in those with advanced disease (CD4 T cell count < 300 cells/microl). An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, which detects interferon (IFN)-gamma secreted by T cells exposed to TB antigens, was used to assess specific immune responses in a prospective study of 201 HIV-1-infected patients with risk factors for TB infection, attending a single HIV unit. The performance of the ELISPOT assay to detect TB antigen-specific immune responses is independent of CD4 T cell counts in HIV-1 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis does not differ significantly from values obtained in immunocompetent subjects. The negative predictive value of the TB ELISPOT test is 98.2%. A positive predictive value of 86% for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis was found when the combined number of early secretory antigen target-6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein-10 (CFP-10) IFN-gamma spots to CD4 T cell count ratio was > 1.5. TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in HIV patients with low CD4 T cell counts using ELISPOT technology in a routine diagnostic laboratory and is a useful test to exclude TB infection in immune-deficient HIV-1 patients. A combination of TB antigen-specific IFN-gamma responses and CD4 T cell counts has the potential to distinguish active tuberculosis from latent infection."
3817,0.001,1.0000,"We conducted a survival analysis with competing risks to estimate the mortality rate and predictive factors for immunodeficiency-related death in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) in northeast Brazil. A cohort with 2372 PLWH was enrolled between July 2007 and June 2010 and monitored until 31 December 2012 at two healthcare centres. The event of interest was immunodeficiency-related death, which was defined based on the Coding Causes of Death in HIV Protocol (CoDe). The predictor variables were: sociodemographic characteristics, illicit drugs, tobacco, alcohol, nutritional status, antiretroviral therapy, anaemia and CD4 cell count at baseline; and treatment or chemoprophylaxis for tuberculosis (TB) during follow-up. We used Fine & Gray's model for the survival analyses with competing risks, since we had regarded immunodeficiency-unrelated deaths as a competing event, and we estimated the adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratios (SHRs). In 10 012·6 person-years of observation there were 3·1 deaths/100 person-years (2·3 immunodeficiency-related and 0·8 immunodeficiency-unrelated). TB (SHR 4·01), anaemia (SHR 3·58), CD4 <200 cells/mm3 (SHR 3·33) and being unemployed (SHR 1·56) were risk factors for immunodeficiency-related death. This study discloses a 13% coverage by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in our state and adds that anaemia at baseline or the incidence of TB may increase the specific risk of dying from HIV-immunodeficiency, regardless of HAART and CD4."

The simplicity of this novel plaque assay allowed us to examine a large number of serum samples from patients with HIV infection for neutralizing antibody activity against two human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) strains. During the progression of clinical disease, the neutralizing activity in the sera from two individual patients remained unchanged or increased. A patient with a known time of HIV infection produced cross-neutralizing antibody at 25-34 weeks. The neutralizing activity in the sera from 17 asymptomatic carriers, four patients with AIDS-related complex and four AIDS patients was also examined and was found to be unrelated to the clinical stage."

GBV-C-infected patients exhibited a complete virological response to HAART more often than patients without [correction] GBV-C and had a greater increase in median CD4 cell count and a marginally greater median HIV RNA level decrease. This association was found to be independent of baseline CD4 cell count and plasma HIV RNA, which indicates that an association exists between GBV-C infection and response to HAART."
7734,0.001,1.0000,"Cancers associated with immunosuppression and infections have long been recognized as a major complication of HIV/AIDS. More recently, persons living with HIV are increasingly diagnosed with a wider spectrum of HIV-associated malignancies (HIVAM) as they live longer on combination antiretroviral therapy. This has spurred research to characterize the epidemiology and determine the optimal management of HIVAM with a focus on low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Given background coinfections, environmental exposures, host genetic profiles, antiretroviral therapy usage, and varying capacities for early diagnosis and treatment, one can expect the biology of cancers in HIV-infected persons in LMICs to have a significant impact on chronic HIV care, as is now the case in high-income countries. Thus, new strategies must be developed to effectively prevent, diagnose, and treat HIVAM in LMICs; provide physical/clinical infrastructures; train the cancer and HIV workforce; and expand research capacity-particularly given the challenges posed by the limitations on available transportation and financial resources and the population's general rural concentration. Opportunities exist to extend resources supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria to improve the health-care infrastructure and train the personnel required to prevent and manage cancers in persons living with HIV. These HIV chronic care infrastructures could also serve cancer patients regardless of their HIV status, facilitating long-term care and treatment for persons who do not live near cancer centers, so that they receive the same degree of care as those receiving chronic HIV care today."

In 1 patient, recently started on highly active antiretroviral therapy, MS-like disease could represent an immune reconstitution syndrome. The lesions were reversible in 2 patients, but rapidly fatal in the third patient. These cases show that an MS-like disease may present in advanced HIV infection as focal monophasic leukoencephalopathy with either a reversible or fulminating course, mimicking progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are known to play an important role in controlling HIV-1 replication, which has led to an increasing interest in augmenting conventional antiretroviral therapy with therapeutic vaccination. The successful development of a therapeutic vaccine will rely on the ability to correlate an aspect of the immune response with clinical outcome. In this study, the CD8(+) T cell maturation status of antigen-specific cells in models of well and poorly controlled virus infections were compared, to show that a memory phenotype predominates when antigen loads are absent or low. In HIV-1 infection, the emergence of memory CD8(+) T cells was found to occur only in individuals with highly suppressed viral replication for an extended duration. Such assessments of the immune response may provide a refined measure of virus control."
7984,0.001,1.0000,"Although chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the west and over the past two decades the incidence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has significantly increased, few reports of the coincidence of these diseases exist in the literature. Other lymphoid malignancies such as non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and Hodgkin's disease (HD) occur frequently with HIV and indeed the former is an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness. It is not clear why HIV infected patients have a predisposition for some B-cell disorders and not others. This may be related to the different age ranges for patients with CLL and HIV infection although an overlap clearly does exist. Here, we describe our experience with a patient with co-existing HIV infection and CLL and explore possible implications."
3108,0.001,1.0000,"The study investigated the impact of xerostomia on oral health and quality of life (QoL) among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who were attending for routine HIV monitoring in Australia. This cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey and oral screening (OS) included 100 subjects who were HIV positive. The OS was conducted by a dentist blinded to the subject's survey responses. Xerostomia was determined by asking the subjects a single question. Subjects with xerostomia were found to have increased caries activity and poorer QoL, especially in the psychological dimensions of the oral health impact profile. Age and duration of HIV infection were associated with xerostomia. Early diagnosis of xerostomia and intervention with preventive dental care would potentially reduce caries and improve QoL among patients infected with HIV-1. Ongoing chronic inflammation of salivary glands despite the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapy may play a role in the etiology of xerostomia in patients infected with HIV and requires further study."
1742,0.001,1.0000,"This study compares the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and HIV risk behaviors among 1,702 injection drug users (IDUs) recruited within four catchment areas in metropolitan San Juan (79.9% male and 20.1% female). To assess the impact of different antecedent variables on intercommunity risk differences, we constructed separate logistic regression models for each one of the catchment areas in the analysis. Old San Juan/Santurce has the highest rate of HIV seropositivity. Furthermore, Old San Juan/Santurce IDUs were more likely to have had incarceration experience, to report using drugs only by injection, and to have been injecting drugs for 16 years or more. Also, this group was more likely to report practicing prostitution and to have been diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) than their peers from the other sites. The need of preventive programs in specific communities within metropolitan urban areas is discussed."
9704,0.001,1.0000,"The life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is intricately related to the activation state of the host cells supporting viral replication. Although cellular activation is essential to mount an effective host immune response to invading pathogens, paradoxically the marked systemic immune activation that accompanies HIV-1 infection in vivo may play an important role in sustaining phenomenal rates of HIV-1 replication in infected persons. Moreover, by inducing CD4+ cell loss by apoptosis, immune activation may further be central to the increased rate of CD4+ cell turnover and eventual development of CD4+ lymphocytopenia. In addition to HIV-1-induced immune activation, exogenous immune stimuli such as opportunistic infections may further impact the rate of HIV-1 replication systemically or at localized anatomical sites. Such stimuli may also lead to genotypic and phenotypic changes in the virus pool. Together, these various immunological effects on the biology of HIV-1 may potentially enhance disease progression in HIV-infected persons and may ultimately outweigh the beneficial aspects of antiviral immune responses. This may be particularly important for those living in developing countries, where there is little or no access to antiretroviral drugs and where frequent exposure to pathogenic organisms sustains a chronically heightened state of immune activation. Moreover, immune activation associated with sexually transmitted diseases, chorioamnionitis, and mastitis may have important local effects on HIV-1 replication that may increase the risk of sexual or mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. The aim of this paper is to provide a broad review of the interrelationship between immune activation and the immunopathogenesis, transmission, progression, and treatment of HIV-1 infection in vivo."

1338,0.001,1.0000,"Loss of CD4(+) T cells in the gut is necessary but not sufficient to cause AIDS in animal models, raising the possibility that a differential loss of CD4(+) T-cell subtypes may be important. We found that CD4(+) T cells that produce interleukin (IL)-17, a recently identified lineage of effector CD4(+) T-helper cells, are infected by SIV(mac251)in vitro and in vivo, and are found at lower frequency at mucosal and systemic sites within a few weeks from infection. In highly viremic animals, Th1 cells predominates over Th17 T cells and the frequency of Th17 cells at mucosal sites is negatively correlated with plasma virus level. Because Th17 cells play a central role in innate and adaptive immune response to extracellular bacteria, our finding may explain the chronic enteropathy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Thus, therapeutic approaches that reconstitute an adequate balance between Th1 and Th17 may be beneficial in the treatment of HIV infection."
4932,0.001,1.0000,"The objective was to determine the current use of their general practitioner (GP) by patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and whether such patients would be interested in having 'shared care' between a specialist HIV clinic and their GP. A questionnaire was administered to 203 HIV-positive men attending the HIV outpatient clinic of a central London teaching hospital. The main outcome measures were patient characteristics, numbers of patients registered with a GP, numbers of patients with a GP aware of their diagnosis, contacts with the GP in the last year and level of interest and shared care. Eighty-five per cent of patients were registered with a GP of whom 67% knew of the diagnosis. Those diagnosed for more than 2 years were significantly more likely to have an informed GP. A total of 73% of those registered had visited their GP in the previous year although only 27% had visited for an HIV-related problem. Only 19% had a GP actively involved in their HIV care. In all 51% of the patients indicated an interest in having shared care between the clinic and their GP. A high proportion of HIV patients are registered with and attend a GP although they rarely consult for HIV-related problems. A significant proportion of patients expressed interest in having shared care suggesting that there is the potential for increased GP involvement in the care of patients with HIV infection."
8267,0.001,1.0000,"It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that efforts to optimize nutritional status through individualized medical nutrition therapy, assurance of food and nutrition security, and nutrition education are essential to the total system of health care available to people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection throughout the continuum of care. Broad-based efforts to improve health care access and treatment have stabilized HIV prevalence levels in many parts of the world and led to longer survival for people living with HIV infection. Confounding clinical and social issues, such as medication interactions, comorbidities, wasting, lipodystrophy, food insecurity, aging, and other related conditions further complicate disease management. With greater understanding of the mechanisms of HIV disease and its impact on body function, development of new treatments, and wider ranges of populations affected, the management of chronic HIV infection continues to become more complex and demanding. Achievement of food and nutrition security and management of nutrition-related complications of HIV infection remain significant challenges for clients with HIV infection and health care professionals. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, should integrate their efforts into the overall health care strategies to optimize their clinical and social influence for people living with HIV infection."

An empowerment focused intervention is a procedure by which HIV infected people obtain combined possession of programs to attain mainly cost-effective HIV outcomes and deal with social and structural difficulties related to their universal health access and human rights. Empowerment is a key approach for addressing HIV related issues that focuses on addressing a broader context. However, the practices of empowerment based approaches are sparse. We assessed the effect of an intervention to empower HIV infected people receiving ART."
9443,0.001,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) policy for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has historically been based on clinical indications, such as opportunistic infections and CD4 cell counts. Studies suggest that CD4 counts early in HIV infection do not predict relevant public health outcomes such as disease progression, mortality, and HIV transmission in people living with HIV. CD4 counts also vary widely within individuals and among populations, leading to imprecise measurements and arbitrary ART initiation. To capture the clinical and preventive benefits of treatment, the global HIV response now focuses on increasing HIV diagnosis and ART coverage. CD4 counts for ART initiation were necessary when medications were expensive and had severe side effects, and when the impact of early ART initiation was unclear. However, current evidence suggests that although CD4 counts may still play a role in guiding clinical care to start prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, CD4 counts should cease to be required for ART initiation."
5459,0.001,1.0000,"In order to determine the prevalence of HIV infection in french patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis therapy, questionnaire forms were mailed out in february 1997 to the heads of the 260 dialysis facilities. We documented number of patients on maintenance dialysis therapy (hemo and peritoneal dialysis) and for HIV infected dialysis patients: age, gender, cause and duration of ESRD, known duration of HIV infection, risk factors for HIV infection, HBV and/or HCV infection, presence of clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), total CD4 count and treatment with antiretroviral agents. Questionnaire forms were returned from 98% of the dialysis facilities. As of february 1997 some 22,707 patients with ESRD were treated by renal replacement therapy, 19,947 by hemodialysis (HD) and 2760 by peritoneal dialysis (PD). 82 patients with ESRD and HIV infection were reported corresponding to 0.36% prevalence rate of all patients undergoing dialysis at the time specified. The 82 study subjects with ESRD and HIV infection received hemodialysis (79 patients) or peritoneal dialysis (3 patients) in 42 facilities. Forty seven patients were treated in Paris and suburbs and 9 in our own center. All 82 patients comprised 63% men and 47% women which included patients coming from Africa (37%), Caribbean and Oceania (28%), Europe (35%) of a mean age of 41.8 years. Modes of transmission were homobisexuals 15%, heterosexuals 31%, intravenous drug abusers 17%, blood transfusion 17% and unknown 20%. The mean duration of HIV infection was 96 months (range 12-168 months) and the mean duration of ESRD was 58 months (range 1-235 months). HIV associated nephropathy was established in 31%. AIDS was diagnosed in 25 patients. Seventy one percent of the patients were receiving an antiretroviral drug (tritherapy in 25% of cases). In conclusion HIV prevalence rate among French dialysis patients is low and focused in Paris and oversea. Sexual transmission is the most important HIV contamination but blood transfusion transmission remains greater than in general HIV population. Survival has improved compared with the survival rate reported in the 1980s."
4864,0.001,1.0000,"HIV transmitted drug resistance (TDR) can compromise antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited countries like China where ART has been scaled up and thus leads to an important public health concern. The aim of the study was to elucidate the HIV-1 genetic characteristics and TDR in Hangzhou, China. Two-hundred eleven ART-naive, newly diagnosed individuals were enrolled during January and August 2013. Specimens were classified as recent or chronic infections using the BED capture enzyme immunoassay (BED-CEIA). The pol fragment covering the entire protease and the first 300 codons of the reverse transcriptase gene was amplified by RT-PCR and nested PCR. Genotypic drug resistance (DR) and phylogenetic analysis were performed on the 200 obtained sequences. Multiple genotypes were identified, including CRF01_AE (62.0%), CRF07_BC (31.0%), subtype B (2.0%), CRF08_BC (1.5%), CRF55_01B (1.0%), CRF18_cpx (0.5%), and unique recombinant forms (URFs, 2.0%). All the four URFs were found in men who have sex with men, consisting of a recombination of CRF01_AE with subtype B or CRF07_BC. The prevalence of primary DR in newly diagnosed individuals in Hangzhou was low (4.0%). The proportion of DR mutation to protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was 1.5%, 1.5%, and 1.0%, respectively. BED-CEIA revealed that 21.8% (45/211) of the specimens were associated with recent infections. The prevalence of TDR in recent infections was moderate (6.5%). High HIV diversity and relatively high prevalence of TDR in new infections has been found in Hangzhou, indicating an increasing challenge for future HIV prevention and treatment."
9447,0.001,1.0000,"Enteroparasites are related to gastrointestinal alterations among patients with HIV/AIDS, some causing severe manifestations in the period before the institution of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The prevalence of enteroparasitoses in patients with HIV/AIDS seen at two hospitals in Ceará , Brazil, was compared in the pre-HAART (Group 1; n = 482) and HAART (Group 2; n = 100) eras. Fecal parasitologic examinations (FPE) were performed using the direct, Lutz, Baermann-Moraes and modified Ziehl-Neelsen methods. The following parasites were detected in Groups 1 and 2, respectively: Strongyloides stercoralis--30.1% and 11% (p<0.0001), Ascaris lumbricoides--15.6% and 2% (p<0.0001), hookworms--3.7% and 2% (p<0.0001), Trichuris trichiura--13.1% and 1% (p<0.0001), Hymenolepis nana--0 and 1% (p = 0.1718), Giardia duodenalis--7.9% and 1% (p = 0.0076), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar--3.3% and 1% (p = 0.3301), Isospora belli--4.8% and 1% (p = 0.0993), Cryptosporidium sp.--8.1% and 0 (p = 0.0007), and non-pathogenic protozoans as well. There was a significant reduction in the prevalence of enteroparasites between the eras (63.9% to 24%; p<0.0001). In the HAART era, the following observations were made: greater frequency of enteroparasites in patients without antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.0575), as in those with AIDS (p = 0.08), and diarrhea (36% of the patients); lack of association with positive FPE (p = 0.626); and non-detection of Cryptosporidium sp. Strongyloides stercoralis showed an elevated prevalence in the two eras and was more frequent in men (32.41%) than women (19.04%) of Group 1 (p = 0.018), a finding suggesting the transmission of the helminth through sodomy. The advent of the HAART modified the profile of opportunistic infections, including parasites, probably due to the reconstitution of cellular immunity and the direct action of HAART on the parasites."
7184,0.001,1.0000,"The Brazilian hepatitis B (HBV) vaccination program for neonates was implemented in 1998 and broadened to include young people up to 20 years of age in 2001. However, HBV coverage of teenagers has not been systematically assessed in Brazil. A cross-sectional study was performed to estimate the magnitude of HBV infection and vaccine coverage among adolescent students regularly enrolled in the public schools of Barra do Garças, a city located in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. A representative sample was randomly obtained and participants were interviewed and had blood samples collected to test for HBV markers. The sample was composed of 576 subjects, 51% of which were females. The average age was 15, with the group ranging from 12 to 20 years of age. There were 29 anti-HBc reactive participants (5.0%). Four out of 29 were HBsAg positive (0.7%). Anti-HBs alone (vaccinated profile) showed in 323 (56.1%) students and 224 (38.9%) were negative for all HBV markers. Increasing age was associated with HBV exposure in a χ(2) for trend analysis (p=0.004). The prevalence of anti-HBs alone decreased as the subjects' age increased. Multivariate analysis showed independent association between HBV infection and the start of sexual activity. Another associated variable was the fact that the some students were enrolled in two low-income neighborhood schools. Our findings classify this area as low endemic for HBV and suggest that there is a progressive decrease in the spread of HBV in the region due to the introduction of universal vaccination of neonates. Approximately half of the adolescents 15 years or older were not immunized, which raises a concern in terms of the need to increase the vaccination rate for this segment of the population."
4762,0.001,1.0000,"Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. African Americans (AAs) have the highest incidence of CRC of any American ethnic group. Survival from CRC in AAs is lower than in Caucasians, and the mean age of CRC development in AAs is younger. The AA community also has a high rate of HIV infection, accounting for 50.3% of all cases despite making up only 13.6% of the population. This retrospective cohort study identified 17 AA HIV patients with CRC. The patients were matched with 42 HIV-negative CRC patients (controls), based on age, sex, and TNM stage. Data were obtained from 3 hospitals in New Jersey: St. Michael's Medical Center, Trinitas Medical Center and St. Joseph's Medical Center. The age, sex, HIV status, tumor site, stage, drug usage, Hepatitis C status, and survival outcome of subjects and controls were compared. Data from the Surveillance Epidemiology & End Results (SEER) specific to AAs were also compared. The mean age of CRC diagnosis was younger, 50.7 years (median: 52 years, range: 35-71 years), versus 59.42 years (median: 66 years) (P < 0.0001) in the SEER AA population. Of the patients, 29.4% were diagnosed with CRC at less than 45 years of age, versus only 6.35% of the SEER AA population (P < 0.0002). The male-to-female ratio was 11:6. Seven individuals used IV drugs, and 7 had hepatitis C. The mean CD4+ T-cell count was 510.81 cells/mm(3) (median 419). At the time of CRC diagnosis, the average duration of HIV infection was 7.6 years (range 0-22.4 years).Of patients, 87.5% had left-sided CRC, versus 57.55% of the SEER population (P < 0.024). Of the patients, 52.94% had stage III-IV, at diagnosis, versus 43.84% in SEER. There was no statistically significant survival difference between the cases and controls. In our cohort of HIV-infected AA's with CRC, the staging and outcome of CRC did not appear to be affected by the degree of immunosuppression. HIV-infected AA with CRC presented with a higher percentage of left-sided CRC than AA's without HIV. Additionally, AAs with HIV tended to be younger at the time of CRC diagnosis. Our findings suggest that screening for CRC should be offered to HIV-infected AAs before the age of 45, and that sigmoidoscopy with fecal occult blood testing might be an acceptable screening modality. However, the exact age of initiation, optimal frequency, and preferred method of screening (colonoscopy vs. sigmoidoscopy) in this population requires further study."
8317,0.001,1.0000,"Humoral response to vaccination has been found to be inadequate in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We retrospectively assessed antibody responses to three routinely recommended vaccines, against hepatitis B, hepatitis A and S. pneumoniae, in HIV-infected individuals. Data regarding age at HIV diagnosis, years of infection, sex, nationality, HIV mode of transmission, CD4 cell count, nadir CD4 count, plasma viral load, HIV stage, insurance status, educational level and treatment with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) were collected. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed in order to detect factors associated with response to vaccination. 437 patients were assessed for hepatitis B, 627 patients for hepatitis A and 66 patients for S. pneumoniae serologic vaccine responsiveness. Regarding hepatitis B and hepatitis A, education level and insurance status were the only predictors of response. As for S. pneumoniae vaccination HAART and control of viremia were correlated with better response to vaccination."
7535,0.001,1.0000,"In the era of antiretroviral therapy, liver disease has emerged as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfected patients. It is believed that HCV is a non-cytopathic virus and that T-cell-mediated events (including the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines) have an important role in promoting both liver damage and viral clearance. Whether HIV coinfection or antiretroviral therapies influence such events is still unclear. In the current study, we compared the expression of NKp46 (a natural killer cell marker), CD3 (a T-cell marker), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; pro-inflammatory cytokines) and interleukin-10 (IL-10; an anti-inflammatory cytokine) mRNA in the liver of naive HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (group one, n=14), coinfected patients treated with antiretroviral therapy (group two, n=23) and naive HCV mono-infected patients (group three, n=24). All three groups had comparable HCV viremia, with coinfected patients showing similar and relatively high CD4+ T-cell counts and significantly different HIV vireamia. Interestingly, when compared to groups two and three, group one showed significantly higher intrahepatic mRNA levels for CD3, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, whereas the expression of NKp46 and IL-10 were comparable in all three groups. Further, higher histopathological grading scores within each group were independently associated with higher mRNA contents for CD3 and IFN-gamma and higher serum alanine aminotransferase levels at the time of liver biopsy. Together, these results suggest that HIV infection may exacerbate the immune-mediated inflammatory response in the liver of patients chronically infected with HCV and antiretroviral therapy may prevent this effect."
5291,0.001,1.0000,"A comprehensive set of recombinant proteins and peptides of the proteome of HIV-1 clade C was prepared and purified and used to measure IgG, IgG-subclass, IgA and IgM responses in HIV-infected patients from Sub-Saharan Africa, where clade C is predominant. As a comparison group, HIV-infected patients from Europe were tested. African and European patients showed an almost identical antibody reactivity profile in terms of epitope specificity and involvement of IgG, IgG subclass, IgA and IgM responses. A V3-peptide of gp120 was identified as major epitope recognized by IgG1>IgG2 = IgG4>IgG3, IgA>IgM antibodies and a C-terminal peptide represented another major peptide epitope for the four IgG subclasses. By contrast, gp41-derived-peptides were mainly recognized by IgG1 but not by the other IgG subclasses, IgA or IgM. Among the non-surface proteins, protease, reverse transcriptase+RNAseH, integrase, as well as the capsid and matrix proteins were the most frequently and strongly recognized antigens which showed broad IgG subclass and IgA reactivity. Specificities and magnitudes of antibody responses in African patients were stable during disease and antiretroviral treatment, and persisted despite severe T cell loss. Using a comprehensive panel of gp120, gp41 peptides and recombinant non-surface proteins of HIV-1 clade C we found an almost identical antibody recognition profile in African and European patients regarding epitopes and involved IgG-sublass, IgA- and IgM-responses. Immune recognition of gp120 peptides and non-surface proteins involved all four IgG subclasses and was indicative of a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response. The HIV-1 clade C proteome-based test allowed diagnosis and monitoring of antibody responses in the course of HIV-infections and assessment of isotype and subclass responses. "
8290,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders continue to be common. Antiretrovirals that achieve higher concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are associated with better control of HIV and improved cognition. The objective of this study was to measure total raltegravir (RAL) concentrations in CSF and to compare them with matched concentrations in plasma and in vitro inhibitory concentrations. Eighteen subjects with HIV-1 infection were enrolled based on the use of RAL-containing regimens and the availability of CSF and matched plasma samples. RAL was measured in 21 CSF and plasma pairs by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and HIV RNA was detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). RAL concentrations were compared to the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) for wild-type HIV-1 (3.2 ng/ml). Volunteers were predominantly middle-aged white men with AIDS and without hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. The median concurrent CD4(+) cell count was 276/μl, and 28% of CD4(+) cell counts were below 200/μl. HIV RNA was detectable in 38% of plasma specimens and 4% of CSF specimens. RAL was present in all CSF specimens, with a median total concentration of 14.5 ng/ml. The median concentration in plasma was 260.9 ng/ml, with a median CSF-to-plasma ratio of 0.058. Concentrations in CSF correlated with those in with plasma (r(2), 0.24; P, 0.02) but not with the postdose sampling time (P, >0.50). RAL concentrations in CSF exceeded the IC(50) for wild-type HIV in all specimens by a median of 4.5-fold. RAL is present in CSF and reaches sufficiently high concentrations to inhibit wild-type HIV in all individuals. As a component of effective antiretroviral regimens or as the main antiretroviral, RAL likely contributes to the control of HIV replication in the nervous system."
2103,0.001,1.0000,"This study was designed to assess the effect of GB virus (GBV)-C on the immune response to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in chronically HIV-infected and HIV- hepatitis C virus (HCV)-co-infected patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy. A cohort of 159 HIV-seropositive patients, of whom 52 were HCV-co-infected, was included. Epidemiological data were collected and virological and immunological markers, including the production of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-2 by CD4, CD8 and Tγδ cells and the expression of the activation marker, CD38, were assessed. A total of 65 patients (40.8%) presented markers of GBV-C infection. The presence of GBV-C did not influence HIV and HCV replication or TCD4 and TCD8 cell counts. Immune responses, defined by IFN-γ and IL-2 production and CD38 expression did not differ among the groups. Our results suggest that neither GBV-C viremia nor the presence of E2 antibodies influence HIV and HCV viral replication or CD4 T cell counts in chronically infected patients. Furthermore, GBV-C did not influence cytokine production or CD38-driven immune activation among these patients. Although our results do not exclude a protective effect of GBV-C in early HIV disease, they demonstrate that this effect may not be present in chronically infected patients, who represent the majority of patients in outpatient clinics."
9394,0.001,1.0000,"Taken as prescribed, that is, with high adherence, combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has changed HIV infection and disease from being a sure predictor of death to a manageable chronic illness. Adherence, however, is difficult to achieve and maintain. The CAPRISA 058 study was conducted between 2007 and 2009 to test the efficacy of individualized motivational counselling to enhance ART adherence in South Africa. As part of the overall trial, a qualitative sub-study was conducted, including 30 individual interviews and four focus group discussions with patients in the first 9 months of ART initiation. Data were inductively analyzed, using thematic analysis, to identify themes central to ART adherence in this context. Four themes emerged that characterize the participants' experiences and high motivation to adhere to ART. Participants in this study were highly motivated to adhere, as they acknowledged that ART was 'life-giving', in the face of a large amount of morbidity and mortality. They were further supported by techniques of routine remembering, and highlighted the importance of good social support and access to supportive healthcare workers, to their continued success in negotiating their treatment. Participants in the current study told us that their adherence motivation is enhanced by free accessible care, approachable and supportive healthcare workers, broad social acceptance of ART, and past first-hand experiences with AIDS-related co-morbidity and mortality. Programs that include specific attention to these aspects of care will likely be successful in the long term."
9771,0.001,1.0000,"This paper reports the results of ethnographic research to describe risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among long-haul truck drivers and the contexts and factors that influence risk and protective behaviors. Drivers were selected using purposive and snowball sampling at trucking-related businesses along major truck routes in Florida. Interview information was used to categorize truckers' levels of potential risk, describe behavioral characteristics of each group, identify sex partners, and assess perceptions of the risk of HIV infection. One-third of the 71 men interviewed had frequent sexual intercourse on the road with multiple partners, but few ever used condoms. Commercial sex workers were their most frequent partners for on-the-road sex. The risk was compounded by occupational conditions, which motivated truckers to drive long hours, often using drugs to stay alert. Sex, alcohol, and drugs were perceived as quick, effective stress relievers during downtime on long, lonely trips. Despite their high-risk behaviors, truckers tended to consider themselves at low risk for HIV infection and expressed a number of misconceptions regarding HIV transmission. For example, many truckers did not associate HIV risk with heterosexual contact or think that condoms were effective in preventing HIV transmission. In addition, many truckers maintained strong homophobic and anti-government opinions that reinforced their suspicion of safe-sex messages. These findings suggest that high-risk sexual behavior is common among long-haul truckers in the US, who may be at risk for HIV infection primarily because of unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple sex partners. Also, drug use may be associated with HIV risk behavior. The authors recommend establishing prevention programs that are developed by and for truckers, determining HIV seroprevalence rates of truckers, addressing drug and alcohol abuse among truckers, and altering industry policy that keeps truckers on the road too long for their own and others' safety."
5187,0.001,1.0000,"During the past decade, AIDS has become a global health problem with 182,000 cases reported from 152 countries. It is estimated that nearly five to ten million people are infected worldwide with the etiologic agent of AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). With a mean incubation period from time of infection to the development of AIDS of eight to ten years, it is projected that nearly all HIV-1-infected individuals will develop AIDS within the next 15 years. In the United States alone, 104,210 cases of AIDS and more than 61,000 deaths have been reported. Sexual, parenteral, and perinatal transmission routes have remained the major modes of transmission, although the proportion of cases within each risk behavior category has changed. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion of patients with AIDS who have acknowledged either IV drug use or heterosexual contact with other individuals at high risk for HIV infection. Inner-city minority populations are disproportionately represented among AIDS patients, and HIV-seroprevalence studies demonstrate significantly higher rates of infection among blacks and Hispanics compared with whites, even within the same risk category. In 1988, the US Public Health Service estimated that approximately 1.0 to 1.5 million Americans were currently infected with HIV-1 and that by the end of 1992, a cumulative total of 380,000 cases of AIDS will be diagnosed. In 1992, 80,000 cases of AIDS may be diagnosed, with 66,000 deaths occurring during that year alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2455,0.001,1.0000,"Before the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the vast majority of HIV-infected patients died from AIDS-related diseases. But, amongst those with access to HAART, AIDS is no longer the leading cause of death. Instead, liver disease is fast becoming the commonest cause of death in HIV-infected patients, particularly in those who have a co-infection with hepatitis C (HCV). The four recent comparative trials of peginterferon and ribavirin in HIV/HCV coinfected patients have provided valuable new information about the most appropriate treatment of this difficult group of patients. As with HIV-negative patients, it is clear that peginterferon alpha has advantages over non-pegylated treatment, with superior efficacy, in the form of higher sustained virological responders and comparable safety. Discontinuation rates were higher than reported in HCV mono-infected patients but comparable for most treatment arms. Furthermore, in about half the patients, treatments were not stopped during the first months of treatment because of side effects, but due to non-early virological response."
4390,0.001,1.0000,"Opportunistic infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are common complications of advanced immunodeficiency in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Neurological disease is the first manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 10% to 20% of symptomatic HIV-1 infection. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of such disorders is critical. Also, in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), these disease states have changed in presentation and epidemiology. Therefore, we review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of five common central nervous system disorders in individuals with HIV-1 infection: toxoplasma encephalitis, primary central nervous system lymphoma, cryptococcal meningitis, cytomegalovirus encephalitis, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."
291,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B and C virus infections are relatively common among patients with end-stage kidney disease on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients. These conditions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality after kidney transplant. Careful management of the transplant candidate by viral replication assessment and liver biopsy allows to achieve excellent kidney transplant results in these patients, also thanks to the antiviral therapies available today including pretransplant interferon for hepatitis C and nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors for hepatitis B.         Until recently, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was an absolute contraindication to solid organ transplantation. At the end of the 1990s, it became clear that HIV infection, once a fatal disease, could be effectively turned into a chronic condition by the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy. As a result, a growing number of HIV patients develop HIV-associated end-stage renal disease. For this reason we have to reconsider kidney transplant as a possible treatment option. During the last decade, the results of many studies have shown that transplantation can be safe and effective in these patients, as long as HIV infection is effectively controlled by antiretroviral therapy."
6360,0.001,1.0000,"Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is etiologically associated with Kaposi sarcoma (KS), the most common AIDS-associated malignancy. Previous results indicate that the HHV-8 viral transactivator ORF50 interacts synergistically with Tat protein in the transactivation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat (LTR), leading to increased cell susceptibility to HIV infection. Here, we analyze the effect of HHV-8 infection on HIV replication in monocyte-macrophage and endothelial cells, as potential targets of coinfection. Primary or transformed monocytic and endothelial cells were infected with a cell-free HHV-8 inoculum and subsequently infected with lymphotropic or monocytotropic strains of HIV. The results show that HHV-8 coinfection markedly increases HIV replication in both cell types. HHV-8 infection induces also HIV reactivation in chronically infected cell lines and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with asymptomatic HIV, suggesting the possibility that similar interactions might take place also in vivo. Furthermore, coinfection is not an essential condition, since contiguity of differently infected cells is sufficient for HIV reactivation. The results suggest that HHV-8 might be a cofactor for HIV progression and that HHV-8-infected endothelial cells might play a relevant role in transendothelial HIV spread."
1421,0.001,1.0000,"Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in normal neural cell function. Dysregulated or overexpression of NO contributes to neurologic damage associated with various pathologies, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurological disease. Previous studies suggest that HIV-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) produce low levels of NO in vitro and that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is expressed in the brain of patients with neurologic disease. However, the levels of NO could not account for the degree of neural toxicity observed. In this study, we found that induction of iNOS with concomitant production of NO occurred in primary human astrocytes, but not in MDM, when astrocytes were cocultured with HIV-1-infected MDM. This coincided with decreased HIV replication in infected MDM. Supernatants from cocultures of infected MDM and astrocytes also stimulated iNOS/NO expression in astrocytes, but cytokines known to induce iNOS expression (interferon-gamma, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) were not detected. In addition, the recombinant HIV-1 envelope protein gp41, but not rgp120, induced iNOS in cocultures of uninfected MDM and astrocytes. This suggests that astrocytes may be an important source of NO production due to dysregulated iNOS expression and may constitute one arm of the host response resulting in suppression of HIV-1 replication in the brain. It also leads us to speculate that neurologic damage observed in HIV disease may ensue from prolonged, high level production of NO."
757,0.001,1.0000,"A prospective, cross-sectional study was designed to determine the magnetic resonance relaxation times of cerebral white matter in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. T1 and T2 were estimated at 1.5 T using four-point methods. Seventy-five HIV-1 seropositive subjects, 48 seronegative blood donors, and 17 seronegative homosexual men were studied. Associations between relaxometry and clinical classification, neurological status, immunological status, and qualitative MRI were investigated. Statistically significant differences in white matter T1 relaxation time were found comparing low-risk control and AIDS groups (p < .005), seropositive subjects with neurological signs and those without (p < .005), and subjects with low (CD4 < or = 200 x 10(6)/l) and high (CD4 > 200 x 10(6)/1) CD4 cell counts (p < .05). These findings add to the body of information that reveals no HIV-related change in the brain before the onset of symptomatic immunosuppression and go someway to validating the previous visually rated, qualitative findings. Statistically significant difference in white matter T2 relaxation time were also found comparing the two control groups (p < .005) highlighting the need for appropriate controls."
2657,0.001,1.0000,"The outcomes of HIV-infected patients requiring critical care have improved. However, in developing countries, information about HIV-infected patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) is scarce. We describe the prognosis of HIV-infected patients admitted to a Brazilian ICU and the factors predictive of short- and long-term survival. A historical cohort study, including HIV-infected patients admitted to a Brazilian ICU at an HIV/AIDS reference hospital, was conducted. Survivors were followed up for 24 months after ICU discharge. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, disease severity scores and mortality were evaluated. Data were analysed using survival and regression models. One hundred and twenty-five patients were studied. In-ICU and in-hospital mortality rates were 46.4% and 68.0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the in-ICU mortality was significantly associated with APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II scores (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.11), mechanical ventilation (OR, 6.39; 95% CI, 1.29-31.76), tuberculosis treatment (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.03-6.71), use of antiretroviral therapy (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.77) and septic shock (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.78-10.76). Septic shock was also associated with long-term survival (hazard ratio, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.31-6.90). In-hospital and in-ICU mortality were higher than those reported for developed countries. ICU admission mostly due to AIDS-related diseases may explain these differences."
8417,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-positive refugees confront a variety of challenges in accessing and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and attaining durable viral suppression; however, there is little understanding of what these challenges are, how they are navigated, or how they may differ across humanitarian settings. We sought to document and examine accounts of the threats, barriers and facilitators experienced in relation to HIV treatment and care and to conduct comparisons across settings. We conducted semi-structured interviews among a purposive sample of 14 refugees attending a public, urban HIV clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (July-September 2010), and 12 refugees attending a camp-based HIV clinic in Kakuma, Kenya (February-March 2011). We used framework methods and between-case comparison to analyze and interpret the data, identifying social and environmental factors that influenced adherence. The multiple issues that threatened adherence to antiretroviral therapy or precipitated actual adherence lapses clustered into three themes: ""migration"", ""insecurity"", and ""resilience"". The migration theme included issues related to crossing borders and integrating into treatment systems upon arrival in a host country. Challenges related to crossing borders were reported in both settings, but threats pertaining to integration into, and navigation of, a new health system were exclusive to the Malaysian setting. The insecurity theme included food insecurity, which was most commonly reported in the Kenyan setting; health systems insecurity, reported in both settings; and emotional insecurity, which was most common in the Kenyan setting. Resilient processes were reported in both settings. We drew on the concept of ""bounded agency"" to argue that, despite evidence of personal and community resilience, these processes were sometimes insufficient for overcoming social and environmental barriers to adherence. In general, interventions might aim to bolster individuals' range of action with targeted support that bolsters resilient processes. Specific interventions are needed to address locally-based food and health system insecurities. "
7003,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single stranded RNA virus. It affects millions of people worldwide and is considered as a leading cause of liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A recent study reported that TLR4 gene polymorphisms are good prognostic predictors and are associated with protection from liver fibrosis among Caucasians. This study aims to investigate the implication of genetic polymorphisms of TLR4 gene on the HCV infection in Saudi Arabian patients. Two SNPs in the TLR4 gene, rs4986790 (A/G) and rs4986791 (C/T), were genotyped in 450 HCV patients and 600 uninfected controls. The association analysis confirmed that both SNPs showed a significant difference in their distribution between HCV-infected patients and uninfected control subjects (P < 0.0001; OR = 0.404, 95% CI = 0.281-0.581) and (P < 0.0001; OR = 0.298, 95% CI = 0.201-0.443), respectively. More importantly, haplotype analysis revealed that four haplotypes, AC, GT, GC, and AT (rs4986790, rs4986791), were significantly associated with HCV infection when compared with control subjects. One haplotype AC was more prominently found when chronic HCV-infected patients were compared with cirrhosis/HCC patients (frequency = 94.7% and P = 0.04). Both TLR4 SNPs under investigation were found to be significantly implicated with HCV-infection among Saudi Arabian population."
4703,0.001,1.0000,"Injection drug use is a common route of infection for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the UK. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and force of infection for HBV among injecting drug users (IDUs) recruited from multiple community and drug agency settings in England and Wales between 1990 and 2004. Cross-sectional studies of IDUs in and out of contact with drug agencies were conducted throughout the 15-year period. Oral fluid samples were tested for antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between risk factors and anti-HBc positivity and force of infection models were explored. In total, 2527 injectors were recruited from community settings, and 29 386 from drug agencies. Anti-HBc prevalence was 31% (95% CI 30.7-31.8%). It declined in the early 1990s from around 50% in 1992 to 25% in 1999, after which it increased slightly. It was also higher in those who had injected for longer, older IDUs, those recruited in London and North West England, and those reporting having a previous voluntary confidential HIV test. The force of infection models suggested that the incidence of infection increased in 1999-2004 compared with 1993-1998, and was higher in new injectors compared with those injecting for > or =1 year. In conclusion, findings suggest ongoing HBV transmission in recent years despite an overall decline in prevalence in the early and mid-1990s, and highlight the importance of targeting vaccination programmes at new IDUs who have high incidence rates of infection."
7060,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this work was to estimate the future disease burden of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in the United States until the year 2030. Two back-calculation models of the HIV and the HCV epidemic were developed. They were based on US epidemiological data regarding prevalence, age and gender of incident cases, AIDS, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mortality and general population mortality from the Centers for Disease Control and WHO. Based on the HCV back-calculation model, HCV incidence peaked in 1984 at 350,000 new infections and then fell to about 77,000 in 1998. Based on the HIV back-calculation model, HIV incidence reached its maximum in 1989 at 142,000 new infections and then declined to 79,000 in 1998. Mortality related to HCV (death from liver failure or HCC) rose from about 3,700 in 1998 and is expected to peak at about 13,000 in 2030. Predicted HCV mortality would fall only if increased access to or more effective antiviral therapy occurs. For comparison, observed HIV-related mortality was 14,400 in 1998 and projected to be 4,200 for 2030. With the availability of effective highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection, mortality from HIV appears to have declined substantially, whereas HCV-related deaths as a result of pre-1999 infections will likely continue to increase over the next 25 years."
2907,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes in Turkey. Epidemiological and clinical data for 158 patients with acute HBV infection from 22 medical centres in the period February 2001 to February 2002 were collected prospectively. HBV genotyping was based on analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms and nested PCR. There were 59 female and 99 male patients, with a mean age of 34.2 +/- 15.6 years. The most common probable transmission route was blood contact in 63 (41.1%) cases, but was unknown in 78 (49.4%) cases. The mean alanine aminotransferase level was 1718 +/- 1089 IU/L. Four of the 158 patients (2.5%) died because of fulminant hepatitis. One year after discharge, 11 (10.6%) of 103 cases were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 80 (77.7%) were positive for anti-HBsAg. Genotype determination was unsuccessful in 11 cases because of a negative PCR; genotype D was found in the remaining 147 cases. The results suggested that acute HBV infection constitutes a significant health problem in Turkey and that genotype D is predominant."
3384,0.001,1.0000,"An unusual hepatitis B virus (HBV) variant, assigned provisionally to genotype I, was recently reported, characterized by an anomalous genotyping pattern and putative recombination; however, the natural history of this unusual strain is unknown. This study analyzed longitudinal sera collected over a 9-year period from a patient infected with this variant to investigate the clinical profile and intrahost viral evolution over time. The patient, who had immigrated to Canada in 1998 from Vietnam, was treated with lamivudine in 2000. Approximately 4-5 years following the withdrawal of lamivudine therapy, a genomic ""shift"" occurred coincident with ALT flares and increasing HBV viral load, resulting in numerous stable nucleotide substitutions within the core coding region, suggesting altered immune control that may provide a selective advantage to the virus. Analysis of quasispecies diversity over time demonstrated further this shift, with two sequence clusters associated with time points either prior to or following relapse observed, including increased diversity among quasispecies prior to relapse. In keeping with the complex nature of genotype I strains, majority population genomes had a mean genetic distance from genotype C of 7.6 +/- 0.1%, although large genomic segments lacked significant homology with any HBV genotype. Further study is needed to understand the evolutionary origin and natural history of infection with this unique HBV variant."
8648,0.001,1.0000,"In the United States, an estimated 24,000 women with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection give birth each year. To prevent mother-to-child HBV transmission, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends administering postexposure prophylaxis of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) to infants born to HBV-infected women within 12 hours of delivery, followed by completion of the HepB series. In 1990, CDC established a national Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) to support federal immunization program grantees in performing this ACIP-recommended case management of infants born to HBV-infected women. Perinatal HBV infections currently are reported by state and local health departments to CDC through two parallel processes: by immunization programs as part of federal program grant reporting requirements and by communicable disease surveillance units as part of the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). A review of perinatal HBV infection reporting for infants born in 2005 identified 68 cases reported by immunization programs and 47 cases reported by communicable disease surveillance units, resulting in a total of 73 unique cases, 42 (58%) of which were reported by both systems. Following investigation, data reconciliation, and additional NNDSS reporting, 78 unique cases were identified, 63 (84%) of which were reported by both systems. Improved information-sharing between immunization programs and communicable disease surveillance units of health departments is essential to ensure more complete identification, case management, and quantification of perinatal HBV infections. Accuracy and completeness of perinatal HBV infection reporting can help ensure and measure progress toward elimination of HBV transmission in the United States."
3681,0.001,1.0000,"We studied hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission among 7416 Thai children from 148 schools in Kamphaeng Phet province, a rural part of northern Thailand. Their age ranged from 2 to 16 years (median 9 years). Between May 1991 and June 1992, 61 of 2593 (2.4%) in the cohort of susceptible children acquired anti-HBc immunoglobulin. Forty-seven of the 148 schools had children who acquired anti-HBc. School seroconversion rates to anti-HBc varied from 0% to 23%. There was no correlation between percent of carriers in schools and percent of anti-HBc acquisition. Of the 61 children who acquired anti-HBc, eight (13%) became HBsAg carriers but only two were symptomatic, for a clinical to subclinical infection ration of 1 : 30. One of the two symptomatic children became an HBsAg carrier. Three (38%) of the eight who were persistently antigenemic developed antibody to hepatitis B virus e antigen. Males were 2.5 times (95% CI 1.4-4.3) more likely to acquire anti-HBc than females. Risk factors for acquisition of HBc in Thailand over a 9-month period were examined in a subset of 2412 susceptible children and later in a case-control study of 22 children who acquired anti-HBc and 59 age and sex-matched controls. Risks for acquiring anti-HBc were male gender and a history of bleeding gums. In comparing this study to an earlier pilot study among 9848 children from the same area in Thailand, the yearly antibody acquisition rate to anti-HBc among Thai children dropped from 5.7% in 1989 to 2.4% in 1992. A random sample of children in the pilot study showed that 16% were HBsAg positive and 27% had anti-HBc at the beginning of the study. 34% had markers for either anti-HBc or HBsAg. 12% were repeatedly positive for HBsAg a year later."

The aim of this study was to identify the Waorani population in Ecuador and obtain an epidemiologically adequate coverage of vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) among them. Between February and September 2010, three vaccination campaigns were completed as part of a collaborative activity between the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health and the community leaders in the intervention areas. In addition, in 10 of the 22 Waorani communities, during first contact, a questionnaire about risk factors for HBV infection was administered. A total of 16 Waorani communities were registered before the beginning of this intervention, but during the actual process, six additional communities were identified. In total, 1,251 community members were registered, 92.7% of which received all three doses of the vaccine. Among them, 83% of survey respondents reported having been vaccinated, but only 22% were able to show proof. Only 1% of respondents were intravenous drug users, whereas 22% had at least one tattoo. All self-identified as heterosexual, but only 32% reported using condoms during sexual intercourse. By March 2015, no new cases of HB were been reported in any of the Waorani communities. Herein, we report the importance of intersectoral collaboration to strengthen health interventions in an isolated population like the Waorani area."
7902,0.001,1.0000,"Diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by antibody-based testing allows for some recently infected individuals to be falsely assessed as non-infected. Since such individuals often have high viral loads and are capable of transmitting HIV, it is an imperative public health need to identify these individuals. We investigated the feasibility and capability of a diagnostic algorithm which included screening and confirmation of HIV infection using only nucleic-acid-based tests. This investigation involved screening 1361 prospectively collected specimens using antibody-based methods in parallel to simultaneously testing the same specimens by a qualitative HIV RNA detection method (APTIMA HIV-1). Specimens that were positive by antibody screening were confirmed by either immunofluorescent assay or Western blotting, while specimens positive by RNA screening were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. In the course of the study, 27 specimens were found to contain either HIV antibody or HIV RNA. Twenty-six of the 27 specimens were HIV RNA positive, while 23 of the 27 specimens were antibody positive. One specimen was found which possessed HIV antibody but was assessed as negative by the HIV RNA screening test. Four specimens were found to contain detectable HIV RNA but were negative by the antibody screening test. Three of these four patients were negative at point-of-care by rapid test, while one was negative by enzyme immunoassay. These data indicate that screening and confirmation of HIV infection by RNA methods alone, if affordable, may constitute an effective alternative HIV diagnostic algorithm in certain settings."
2689,0.001,1.0000,"This review discusses current reports on herpes simplex virus infections as they relate to the use of laboratory testing, infections in the neonate, herpes simplex virus association with human immunodeficiency virus infection, and updating the current therapy and management of genital herpes. Findings over the past year are important in the clinical management of patients with genital herpes. All health care workers who manage patients with genital herpes need to know the limitations of serologic testing. Current information suggests that serologic commercial testing that is most commonly available cannot discriminate between infections caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2. Laboratory methods still rely on culturing herpes simplex virus in living cells in vitro. However, the availability of monoclonal antibodies allows for rapid assays for the confirmation of cultured herpes simplex virus. In addition, assays have been developed and tested, suggesting that perhaps antigen-detection systems may be available that could replace culturing the virus in living cells. New information on neonatal herpes points out the predictors of morbidity and mortality in newborns who contract herpes within the first few weeks of life. Information concerning asymptomatic shedding in labor will provide the clinician with a better understanding of this disease entity in the pregnant woman. Several studies have confirmed that herpes simplex virus infection is a risk factor for developing human immunodeficiency virus infection. A new study clearly shows that treatment using daily acyclovir therapy over a prolonged period of time can control and may modify herpesvirus infection."
5702,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection affects body composition, but their relationship has not been studied in pregnant women. We conducted a cross-sectional study among 1669 women receiving antenatal care between 22 and 35 wk of gestation in Harare, Zimbabwe. The role of HIV-1 status and viral load, malaria and elevated serum alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin (ACT, an acute phase protein) in weight, body mass index (BMI), arm circumference (AC), triceps skinfold thickness (TSF), and arm muscle (AMA) and fat (AFA) area were assessed using multiple linear regression analysis. The mean (range) age was 24.4 (14-45) y and gestational age 29 (22-35) wk. HIV infection was present in 31.5% of the women, malaria parasitemia in 0.4% and 11.4% had serum ACT >0.4 g/L. There was no difference in any anthropometric variable between HIV-infected and uninfected women. However, women with viral loads (genome equivalents/mL) between 4 and 5 and >5 log(10) had 1.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.3, 2.3] and 2.5 (95% CI: 0.1, 5.1) kg lower weights compared with uninfected women; this was explained by losses of both AFA and AMA. Malaria parasitemia was associated with 6 cm(2) (95% CI: 0.4; 11.8) or 25% lower AMA. Elevated serum ACT was a negative predictor of all anthropometric variables, i.e., levels between 0.3 and 0.4, 0.4 and 0.5 and >0.5 g/L were associated with 1, 2 and 6 kg lower mean body weights, respectively. Despite the limitations of a cross-sectional design, we conclude that arm fat and muscle areas, reflecting body fat and lean body mass, seem to be unaffected in the majority of HIV-infected pregnant women, but decline with increasing viral loads. The effects of viral load are not explained by elevated serum ACT, which is a strong independent predictor of all anthropometric variables."
5301,0.001,1.0000,"Liver transplantation is currently considered definitive therapy for end-stage liver disease (1-4). The hepatitis B virus (HBV) affects a large group of candidates for liver transplantation (1-4), however, liver transplantation for HBV is associated with unique and serious problems due to post-transplant predisposition for HBV re-infection of the allograft (5-10, 12-14). Patients with actively replicating HBV infection, as demonstrated by positive pre-transplant hepatitis surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis e antigen (HBeAg), and HBV-DNA, patients retransplanted for HBV infection, patients not receiving long term hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) therapy (5-10, 12, 14), and patients of Asian descent (15), appear to be most likely to experience clinically significant recurrent hepatitis (2, 3, 6-14). Recurrent HBV can produce acute or chronic liver disease leading to graft failure, retransplantation, or death (2, 3, 5, 13, 14). For these reasons, liver transplantation for HBV remains controversial. In this review, we describe the proposed mechanisms, predisposing factors, and clinical presentation associated with HBV recurrence in liver allograft recipients. We also discuss current and potential methods of prevention of HBV infection following liver transplantation."

A proportion of patients had hepatitis B virus (HBV) status determined. Hepatotoxicity was graded I to IV according to the AIDS Clinical Trial Group criteria. Of 546 patients, 377 (69%) were women; overall median baseline CD4+ T-cell was 97/μL (interquartile range [IQR] 20-164). Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected in 42 (9%) of 470 persons. ART included lamivudine, with either nevirapine and d4T (74%) or efavirenz and AZT (26%). Median (IQR) AST level at baseline was 35 (27, 53 IU/L). Over 36 months, only eight patients had grade III AST elevation. Neither HBsAg nor ART regimen influenced AST levels. Male gender and CD4+ change from baseline were correlated with AST elevation. Patients with HIV/HBV co-infection were not at an increased risk of AST elevation, which occurred uncommonly in this setting."

The 2.3 per cent positivity in the test group and the 8 per cent positivity in the control group did not suggest the involvement of hepatitis-B virus (HBV), as an influencing or associated agent. When 48 patients with glomerulonephropathies and 23 controls were screened for liver cell membrane (LMA) and renal cell membrane antibodies (RMA) by indirect immunofluorescent technique using isolated rat hepatocytes and renal cells, 79.2 per cent LMA positivity was seen in the HBsAg positive group and 41.7 per cent in the negative group and RMA positivity was 58 per cent in the positive group and 25 per cent in the negative group. Simultaneous positivity for both LMA and RMA was recorded in 50 per cent of the HBsAg positive patients and 15.7 per cent of the negative ones. The results suggest the possibility of an organ specific autoimmune trigger more frequently in HBV associated glomerulonephropathy."

Among HIV-infected youth, mean age of testing was 18.2 years. One third of the HIV-positive patients were female and four fifths were African-American or Hispanic. No significant differences were found between HIV-positive (n = 50) and HIV-negative (n = 43) patients for age at first intercourse, injecting or other illicit drug use, history of sexually transmitted diseases, or survival sex (exchange of sex for money or drugs). HIV-positive males were more likely than HIV-negative males to have engaged in anal intercourse and to report a history of sexual abuse. Among infected females, 82% acquired HIV through heterosexual intercourse. Almost half (48%) of HIV-positive adolescents had significant immune dysfunction at the time of their initial visit (CD4 < 500/mm3) and were eligible for zidovudine. Many HIV-positive adolescents continued high-risk behaviors such as intercourse without condoms, particularly those with ongoing dependence on drugs or alcohol. With the epidemic of HIV infection increasing nationwide among adolescents, specialized, comprehensive programs are needed to counsel and treat HIV-infected adolescents and youth in high-risk situations."
8594,0.001,1.0000,"The U.S. military represents a unique population within the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) pandemic. The last comprehensive study of HIV-1 in members of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps (Sea Services) was completed in 2000, before large-scale combat operations were taking place. Here, we present molecular characterization of HIV-1 from 40 Sea Services personnel who were identified during their seroconversion window and initially classified as HIV-1 negative during screening. Protease/reverse transcriptase (pro/rt) and envelope (env) sequences were obtained from each member of the cohort. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on these regions to determine relatedness within the cohort and calculate the most recent common ancestor for the related sequences. We identified 39 individuals infected with subtype B and one infected with CRF01_AE. Comparison of the pairwise genetic distance of Sea Service sequences and reference sequences in the env and pro/rt regions showed that five samples were part of molecular clusters, a group of two and a group of three, confirmed by single genome amplification. Real-time molecular monitoring of new HIV-1 acquisitions in the Sea Services may have a role in facilitating public health interventions at sites where related HIV-1 infections are identified."
5654,0.001,1.0000,"Torque teno virus (TTV) and Torque teno minivirus (TTMV) are highly prevalent in the general population and although no disease has been associated with these viruses yet, co-infections with other pathological viruses are frequent. Both viruses are extremely heterogeneous, especially for DNA viruses, and the role of the immune system in controlling the infections has yet to be established. In this study the TTV/TTMV viral loads in HIV positive tissues have been investigated for the first time. The titers of both TTV and TTMV were compared in the bone marrow and spleen tissues from three groups: HIV negative individuals, HIV positive individuals and HIV positive individuals who had progressed to AIDS, leading to immunosuppression. Limiting dilution PCR using primers situated in the UTR region of the genome were used to semi-quantitate the virus, and TTV and TTMV were differentiated using melting curve analysis of the PCR product. The AIDS group had significantly higher titers compared with both the HIV positive and negative groups for both bone marrow (AIDS vs. HIV positive P = 0.006, AIDS vs. HIV negative P < 0.001) and spleen (AIDS vs. HIV positive P = 0.022, AIDS vs. HIV negative P < 0.001). Analysis of TTV/TTMV titer with CD4 T lymphocyte count showed a significant inverse correlation however neither HCV co-infection or type of Anellovirus infection (single TTV or TTMV, or mixed TTV/TTMV) showed any significant correlation with virus titer. The results show a link between deterioration of the immune system and increased the viral loads in studied tissues."
5854,0.001,1.0000,"The rapid evolution of HIV-1 is a major obstacle to viral eradication. Early antiretroviral therapy (ART) during primary HIV-1 infection could limit viral diversity. Eighteen patients recently infected with HIV-1 were selected. Nine initiated ART soon after enrolment and nine remained untreated. Replication-competent (RC) viruses were quantified at baseline and after one year of follow-up. Viral diversity in the C2V5 envelope region was evaluated from plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and cell culture at both time points. The amount of RC virus in the treated group declined (median -5.42 infectious units per million [IUPM]) while it remained stable or increased in the untreated group (median +0.87 IUPM). At one year post infection, we observed a significant increase in diversity for the C2V5 (+0.150%) region, specifically in the hypervariable loops V4 (+0.73%) and V5 (+0.77%), in the untreated group. More importantly, viral diversity did not significantly increase in treated individuals during the first year post infection. Genetic diversity during primary infection remains low through the first year of infection. Early treatment could contribute to a decrease in RC viruses from PBMCs and to limitation of viral diversification in the viral reservoir. These findings may have relevance for the rational design of specific immunotherapeutic strategies."
3005,0.001,1.0000,"The TT virus (TTV) was isolated recently from the serum of a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis. TTV infection is widespread in the general population, and its prevalence increases continuously with age. The pathogenic role of TTV in liver disease remains controversial, and the source of transmission is still unclear. We investigated the pathogenicity and epidemiology of TTV infection in infants born to TTV DNA-positive mothers. Enrolled in this study were 22 mother-child pairs testing negative for antibodies to hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs). The children were followed for 30 months after birth. Serum TTV DNA was detected by N22-PCR, and the PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The prevalence of TTV infection in children increased with age. Of the 22 children, 13 (59%) became positive for TTV DNA during the follow-up period. Of these 13 children, 6 (46%) had elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), although the elevations were transient and mild. TTV viremia was not associated significantly with the abnormal ALT levels. Children with TTV viremia developed neither severe liver disease nor fulminant hepatitis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that, in 11 (85%) of the 13 pairs, the mother and child had the same genotype at the first PCR-positive time point. Among those 11 mother-child pairs, 6 (55%) had identical TTV nucleotide sequences. However, the genotype of predominant clones changed in 5 (50%) of 10 children who were positive for TTV DNA at two or more time points during the follow-up period. In conclusion, this study did not provide evidence that TTV infection is related to liver disease in children. Although the main source of TTV infection in children is presumed to be their mothers, transmitted via non-parenteral routes in the course of daily contact, intrafamilial carriers may also be sources of TTV infection."
6703,0.001,1.0000,"The broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 4E10, 2F5, and Z13e1 target membrane-proximal external region (MPER) epitopes of HIV-1 gp41 in a manner that remains controversial. The requirements for initial lipid bilayer binding and/or CD4 ligation have been proposed. To further investigate these issues, we probed for binding of these MAbs to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) virions with protein A-conjugated gold (PAG) nanoparticles using negative-stain electron microscopy. We found moderate levels of PAG associated with unliganded HIV-1 and SIV virions incubated with the three MAbs. Significantly higher levels of PAG were associated with CD4-liganded HIV-1 (epitope-positive) but not SIV (epitope-negative) virions. A chimeric SIV virion displaying the HIV-1 4E10 epitope also showed significantly higher PAG association after CD4 ligation and incubation with 4E10. MAbs accumulated rapidly on CD4-liganded virions and slowly on unliganded virions, although both reached similar levels in time. Anti-MPER epitope-specific binding was stable to washout. Virions incubated with an irrelevant MAb or CD4-only (no MAb) showed negligible PAG association, as did a vesicle-rich fraction devoid of virions. Preincubation with Fab 4E10 inhibited both specific and nonspecific 4E10 IgG binding. Our data provide evidence for moderate association of anti-MPER MAbs to viral surfaces but not lipid vesicles, even in the absence of cognate epitopes. Significantly greater MAb interaction occurs in epitope-positive virions following long incubation or CD4 ligation. These findings are consistent with a two-stage binding model where these anti-MPER MAbs bind first to the viral lipid bilayer and then to the MPER epitopes following spontaneous or induced exposure."
7248,0.001,1.0000,"A cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-discordant couples was established to evaluate risk factors associated with heterosexual viral transmission. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to document the HIV-uninfected status among members of discordant heterosexual couples and to rule out immunosilent infection. HIV DNA PCR specific for a gag gene region was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 203 HIV antibody-negative adults who have long-term heterosexual relationships with HIV-infected partners. The results were negative for 200 but consistently positive in three individuals. More extensive evaluation of these three individuals with an additional primer pair specific for the envelope gene, quantitative DNA PCR, multiple additional time points, and variable nucleotide tandem repeat analyses revealed specimen processing problems in two cases but an apparent true positive PCR assay in the third case. This subject remains antibody and PCR negative for a 32-month follow-up period. These results confirm previous studies that document a negligible incidence of occult HIV infection as delineated by PCR in antibody negative heterosexual partners of HIV-infected individuals. Specimen processing errors occur at a low rate (1% in this study) and require careful evaluation. The possibility of transient, aborted infection versus successful infection with a long immunosilent period was observed in a single individual. Definitive resolution of infection status will require long-term evaluation."
2118,0.001,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase (IN) protein augments the initiation of reverse transcription. Chimeric HIV-1 containing HIV-2 IN (SG3(IN2)) is severely impaired in virus infectivity and DNA synthesis. To analyze the nature of this defect, we infected T cells with the chimeric SG3(IN2) virus and by continuous passage in cell culture selected for virus with improved replication properties. Viruses from two different time points were chosen for further analysis, an early culture-adapted virus (CF-65) that exhibited an intermediate level of infectivity, and a later-passaged virus (CF-131) that was significantly more infectious. Sequence analysis of multiple clones derived from the CF-65 virus culture demonstrated a diversity of mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) and a common V204I IN mutation. Analysis of clones derived from the CF-131 virus indicated the selection of two additional IN mutations, Q96H and K127E, and a fixed V179I RT mutation. By cloning RT and/or IN sequences back into the original SG3(IN2) chimeric virus, we demonstrated that mutations in both RT and IN contributed to the improvement in viral fitness. The effect of the HIV-2IN(IN(2)) mutations on virus DNA synthesis was analyzed by packaging IN(2) mutants into HIV-1 as Vpr-IN(2) fusion proteins. This analysis revealed that the Q96H, K127E and V204I mutations increased the infectivity of the chimeric virus by augmenting the initiation of viral cDNA synthesis in infected cells. The Q96H and K127E mutations are present in adjacent helical structures on the surface of the IN protein and together account for most of the increase observed in DNA synthesis. Our findings provide evidence that the IN protein augments the initiation of reverse transcription through specific interactions with other viral components comprising the initiation complex. Moreover, they implicate specific regions on the surface of IN that may help to elucidate mechanisms by which the HIV-1 IN protein augments the initiation of HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo."
8905,0.001,1.0000,"The Nef protein of primate immunodeficiency viruses is essential for establishing a highly productive pathogenic infection in vivo. In tissue culture, Nef is not required for infection but enhances viral infectivity. This effect is most pronounced in unstimulated primary lymphocytes and occurs in the early phase of infection prior to viral gene expression. Since Nef expression does not lead to obvious changes in virus composition, it was of interest to analyze whether Nef is incorporated into virus particles. Here, we show that Nef is specifically immunoprecipitated from radioactively labeled human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected cells and virus particle preparations. Quantitative analysis revealed Nef to be incorporated on the order of 10% of reverse transcriptase incorporation, which corresponds to 5 to 10 molecules of Nef per virion. In infected cells, Nef was detected as a full-length 27-kDa protein. In contrast, approximately 50% of particle-associated Nef corresponded to an 18-kDa species which comigrated with the larger product after in vitro cleavage of purified HIV-1 Nef by the viral proteinase. Nef cleavage in particle preparations was completely abolished by a specific inhibitor of HIV-1 proteinase. Most likely, Nef is cleaved concomitantly with viral structural proteins on maturation of virus particles. This cleavage is likely to be functionally significant because it dissociates the conserved core domain from the N-terminal membrane attachment region. Our results suggest that the profound influence of Nef on establishing infection of unstimulated cells in tissue culture and in vivo is mediated by virion-associated Nef which functions in early infection before viral gene expression."
8880,0.001,1.0000,"The long-term efficacy of combination antiretroviral therapy may relate to augmentation of anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) CD8(+) T-cell responses. We found that prolonged treatment of late-stage HIV-1-infected patients with a protease inhibitor and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors failed to restore sustained, high levels of HIV-1-specific, HLA class I-restricted, cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte precursors and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production by CD8(+) T cells. In some patients, particularly those initiating three-drug combination therapy simultaneously rather than sequentially, there were early, transient increases in the frequency of anti-HIV-1 CD8(+) T cells that correlated with decreases in HIV-1 RNA and increases in T-cell counts. In the other patients, HIV-1-specific T-cell functions either failed to increase or declined from baseline during triple-drug therapy, even though some of these patients showed suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA. These effects of combination therapy were not unique to HIV-1 specific T-cell responses, since similar effects were noted for CD8(+) T cells specific for the cytomegalovirus pp65 matrix protein. The level and breadth of CD8(+) cell reactivity to HLA A*02 HIV-1 epitopes, as determined by IFN-gamma production and HLA tetramer staining after combination therapy, were related to the corresponding responses prior to treatment. There was, however, a stable, residual population of potentially immunocompetent HIV-1-specific T cells remaining after therapy, as shown by tetramer staining of CD8(+) CD45RO(+) cells. These results indicate that new strategies will be needed to target residual, immunocompetent HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells to enhance the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in patients with advanced immunodeficiency."
724,0.001,1.0000,"Cyanovirin-N (CV-N), an 11-kDa protein isolated from the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum, potently inactivates diverse strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus. While it has been well established that the viral surface envelope glycoprotein gp120 is a molecular target of CV-N, the detailed mechanism of action is of further interest. We compared matched native and CV-N-treated virus preparations in a panel of assays that measure viral replication, assessing successive stages of the viral life cycle. CV-N-treated virions failed to infect cells as detected by p24 production and quantitative PCR for HIV-1 reverse transcription products, whereas treatment of the target cells did not block infection, confirming that CV-N acts at the level of the virus, not the target cell, to abort the initial infection process. Compared to native HIV-1 preparations, CV-N-treated HIV-1 virions showed impaired CD4-dependent binding to CD4(+) T cells and did not mediate ""fusion from without"" of CD4(+) target cells. CV-N also blocked HIV envelope glycoprotein Env-induced, CD4-dependent cell-cell fusion. Mapping studies with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to defined epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein indicated that CV-N binds to gp120 in a manner that does not occlude or alter the CD4 binding site or V3 loop or other domains on gp120 recognized by defined MAbs and does not interfere with soluble CD4-induced conformational changes in gp120. Binding of CV-N to soluble gp120 or virions inhibited subsequent binding of the unique neutralizing MAb 2G12, which recognizes a glycosylation-dependent epitope. However, prior binding of 2G12 MAb to gp120 did not block subsequent binding by CV-N. These results help clarify the mechanism of action of CV-N and suggest that the compound may act in part by preventing essential interactions between the envelope glycoprotein and target cell receptors. This proposed mechanism is consistent with the extensive activity profile of CV-N against numerous isolates of HIV-1 and other lentiviruses and supports the potential broad utility of this protein as a microbicide to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV."
4624,0.001,1.0000,"The absence of immune defects that occurs in the syndrome of long-term nonprogressive (LTNP) HIV infection offers insights into the pathophysiology of HIV-induced immune disease. The (H[F/S]RIG)(2) domain of viral protein R (Vpr) induces apoptosis and may contribute to HIV-induced T cell depletion. We demonstrate a higher frequency of R77Q Vpr mutations in patients with LTNP than in patients with progressive disease. In addition, T cell infections using vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) pseudotyped HIV-1 Vpr R77Q result in less (P = 0.01) T cell death than infections using wild-type Vpr, despite similar levels of viral replication. Wild-type Vpr-associated events, including procaspase-8 and -3 cleavage, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (deltapsi(m)), and DNA fragmentation factor activation are attenuated by R77Q Vpr. These data highlight the pathophysiologic role of Vpr in HIV-induced immune disease and suggest a novel mechanism of LTNP."
915,0.001,1.0000,"The effects of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) on CD4 receptor expression, susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection, and anti-HIV activity of dextran sulfate and soluble-CD4 were studied in cultured, human primary macrophages. M-CSF stimulated macrophage cells to express the CD4 receptor, and this resulted in an increase of both the number of CD4+ cells and the density of the receptor on the cell surface. M-CSF also significantly enhanced the susceptibility of macrophage cells to HIV infection. Interestingly, the anti-HIV activity of dextran sulfate and soluble-CD4 (two compounds that interfere with HIV-CD4 binding with different mechanisms) was reduced 100-fold and fivefold, respectively, in M-CSF-treated macrophages. Human blood concentrations of M-CSF are reported to be similar to those used in this work (1,000 U/mL); thus, it is conceivable that also in vivo this cytokine may modify the susceptibility of macrophages to HIV and the ability of dextran sulfate and soluble CD4 to inhibit HIV replication. These results suggest that the in vitro study in M-CSF-treated macrophages of promising drugs inhibitors of HIV-CD4 binding could provide further insights into the potential efficacy of these compounds in patients."
2761,0.001,1.0000,"Productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection causes sustained NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in chronically infected monocytic cells. A direct temporal correlation exists between HIV infection and the appearance of NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in myelomonoblastic PLB-985 cells. To examine the molecular basis of constitutive NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in HIV1 -infected cells, we analyzed the phosphorylation and turnover of IkappaBalpha protein, the activity of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and the intracellular levels of NF-kappaB subunits in the PLB-985 and U937 myeloid cell models. HIV-1 infection resulted in constitutive, low-level expression of type 1 interferon (IFN) at the mRNA level. Constitutive PKR activity was also detected in HIV-1-infected cells as a result of low-level IFN production, since the addition of anti-IFN-alpha/beta antibody to the cells decreased PKR expression. Furthermore, the analysis of IkappaBalpha turnover demonstrated an increased degradation of IkappaBalpha in HIV-1-infected cells that may account for the constitutive DNA binding activity. A dramatic increase in the intracellular levels of NF-kappaB subunits c-Rel and NF-kappaB2 p100 and a moderate increase in NF-kappaB2 p52 and RelA(p65) were detected in HIV-1-infected cells, whereas NF-kappaB1 p105/p50 levels were not altered relative to the levels in uninfected cells. We suggest that HIV-1 infection of myeloid cells induces IFN production and PKR activity, which in turn contribute to enhanced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and subsequent degradation. Nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB subunits may ultimately increase the intracellular pool of NF-kappaB/IkappaBalpha by an autoregulatory mechanism. Enhanced turnover of IkappaBalpha and the accumulation of NF-kappaB/Rel proteins may contribute to the chronically activated state of HIV-1-infected cells."
4391,0.001,1.0000,"The host factors involved in the restriction of tumor growth were studied in nude mice transplanted with a cloned line of chronically human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected U937 cells. HIV-infected and uninfected U937 cells exhibited the same growth patterns in culture. However, HIV-infected cells were not tumorigenic when injected subcutaneously in nude mice, whereas large solid tumors were observed in mice injected with uninfected U937 cells. Injection of nude mice with antibody to alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) enabled HIV-infected U937 cells to grow progressively in approximately 90 to 100% of mice. HIV-infected U937 cells formed solid tumors in the majority (60 to 90%) of either immunosuppressed (splenectomized, irradiated, and anti-asialo-GM1-treated) or genetically immunodeficient (bg/nu/xid) nude mice. In mice treated with antibodies to IFN-alpha/beta with established HIV-positive tumors, a direct correlation was found between p24 antigenemia and tumor size. Treatment of established HIV-positive U937 cell tumors with human IFN-alpha or mouse IFN-alpha/beta resulted in a clear-cut inhibition of both tumor growth and p24 HIV antigenemia. In contrast, treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha markedly inhibited tumor growth but did not significantly decrease serum p24 levels. 3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine treatment did not affect either tumor growth or the levels of serum p24 antigen. These data indicate that endogenous IFN-alpha/beta is a crucial factor in the restriction of both tumor growth and p24 antigenemia in mice injected with HIV-infected tumor cells. Moreover, the results suggest that the development of HIV-1 p24 antigenemia in athymic immunosuppressed mice may represent an interesting in vivo model for anti-HIV therapy."
6164,0.001,1.0000,"Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were demonstrated to be susceptible to productive infection by the monocytotropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain HIV-1/Ba-L and by three primary HIV-1 isolates, HIV-1/DAS, HIV-1/PAR and HIV-1/THI. Production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1 beta was monitored between days 3 and 26 after MDM infection. TNF-alpha and IL-6 were detected in cell culture supernatants from days 16 to 21 following HIV-1/DAS, HIV-1/PAR and HIV-1/Ba-L infection, at the time of high viral replication. IL-1 beta was not found at the same time points. TNF-alpha mRNA expression occurred around the peak of both TNF-alpha levels and supernatant RT activities. In HIV-1/THI-infected macrophage cultures no endogenously produced TNF-alpha was observed, despite high levels of HIV-1 in MDM. This result demonstrates that a primary isolate may replicate independently of TNF-alpha in MDM. To investigate the relationship between TNF-alpha and viral replication we used a TNF-alpha synthesis inhibitor, RP 55778. Treatment throughout the course of cell culture resulted in a significant decrease in both TNF-alpha levels and viral production in HIV-1/DAS-, HIV-1/PAR- and HIV-1/Ba-L-infected MDM cultures. This phenomenon is reversed by adding recombinant human TNF-alpha to the RP 55778-treated cell cultures from day 14 post-infection. No effect of RP 55778 was observed in MDM cultures infected with the primary isolate HIV-1/THI, whose replication is independent of TNF-alpha production and therefore remained unchanged after RP 55778 treatment. We conclude that the clinical value of such a drug is directly dependent on the ability of the HIV-1 strains involved to induce TNF-alpha production at the time of viral replication."
6021,0.001,1.0000,"We have tested whether breakdown of phosphatidylcholine (PC) initiated by exogenous addition of a PC-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) from Bacillus cereus or by endogenous overexpression of PC-PLC induces functional activation of NF-kappa B and increases human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enhancer activity. PC-PLC-activated hydrolysis of PC was found to induce bona fide p50/p65 NF-kappa B binding activity in three different cell lines of human or murine origin. No significant changes in the turnover of other cellular phospholipids were detected in PC-PLC-treated cells. Induction of NF-kappa B by PC-PLC did not depend on de novo synthesis of proteins or autocrine secretion of either tumor necrosis factor or interleukin 1. In human monocytic and lymphoblastoid T-cell lines, induction of NF-kappa B by PC-PLC resulted in clear induction of luciferase expression vectors placed under the control of synthetic kappa B enhancers or wild type, but not kappa B-mutated, HIV long terminal repeat constructs. HIV replication was increased by PC-PLC in chronically infected monocytes and T lymphocytes. NF-kappa B activation promoted by addition of exogenous PC-PLC correlated with an intense production of diacylglycerol. However, addition of a phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC from B. cereus also induced diacylglycerol but did not activate kappa B enhancer-directed vectors. PC-PLC-induced NF-kappa B activation could not be blocked by a specific inhibitor of phorbol ester-inducible protein kinases C. These results indicate that a cellular transduction pathway, dependent on specific PC breakdown, is functional in T lymphocytes and monocytes and may be used by various transmembrane receptors to activate HIV transcription through NF-kappa B-dependent induction of the HIV enhancer."
9636,0.001,1.0000,"The post-transplant immune responses, viremia, and allograft histology after living donor liver transplantation were studied in 39 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected recipients. The recipients were classified into the following groups according to a hierarchical clustering of their preoperative CD8CD45 T-cell isoforms: group I, naive-dominant; group II, effector memory-dominant; and group III, effector-dominant. Plasma HCV-RNA rapidly increased and then peaked as an initial burst around postoperative day (POD) 25 in group I, on POD 40 in group II, and on POD 55 in group III. The initial burst of viremia was suppressed by the high expression of CD8+CD28-CD27- subsets. The progression of fibrosis > or =F2 was significantly more frequent for those patients with the highest viremia levels. Moreover, the initial T-cell immune response became less important throughout time, and new immune responses emerged after 2 months that modified the host-virus interaction. It is suggested that the interferon (IFN)-alpha/ribavirin therapy starting 2 months may be an effective option and now is undertaken."
4197,0.001,1.0000,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections lead to rapid depletion of CD4(+) T cells from gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Although the administration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been shown to increase CD4(+) T-cell levels in the peripheral blood in both SIV and HIV infections, its efficacy in restoring intestinal mucosal CD4(+) T cells has not been well investigated. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of virally induced disruptions in the mucosal immune system, we have evaluated longitudinal changes in viral burden, T-cell subsets, and mucosal gene expression profiles in SIV-infected rhesus macaques in the absence or presence of ART. Our results demonstrate a dramatic suppression of mucosal viral loads and rapid reconstitution of CD4(+) T cells in GALT in animals receiving ART that were not observed in untreated SIV-infected animals. DNA microarray-based gene expression profiling indicated that CD4(+) T-cell restoration in GALT was associated with up regulation of growth factors and genes involved in repair and regeneration of the mucosal epithelium. In contrast, untreated SIV-infected animals increased expression of lymphocyte activation and inflammatory response-associated genes and did not up regulate mucosal growth and repair associated transcription. In conclusion, these data indicate that initiating ART in primary SIV infection may lead to the restoration of the mucosal immune system through reduction of inflammation and promotion of epithelial repair in the intestinal mucosa."
7195,0.001,1.0000,"Although several antiretroviral compounds are already known, almost no acyclic nucleoside derivatives lacking an oxacyclopentane have been reported to exert significant inhibition against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in vitro. We found two unsaturated acyclic nucleoside derivatives, adenallene [9-(4'-hydroxy-1',2'-butadienyl)adenine] and cytallene [1-(4'-hydroxy-1',2'-butadienyl)cytosine], that protect various CD4+ T-cell lines from the infectivity and cytopathic effect of HIV-1. These compounds inhibit the expression of HIV-1 gag-encoded protein and suppress viral DNA synthesis at concentrations that do not affect functions of normal T cells in vitro. They also inhibit the in vitro infectivity of another human retrovirus, HIV-2. Further in vitro analyses of the anti-HIV-1 activity revealed that the presence of two cumulated double bonds between the 1' and 2' carbons and between the 2' and 3' carbons confers antiretroviral activity in certain pyrimidine or purine derivatives containing a four-carbon chain. We have also found that the 4'-hydroxyl group is critical for the in vitro anti-HIV activity of adenallene. Our observations may provide structure-activity relationships for acyclic nucleoside analogues and may be of value in developing a new class of experimental drugs for the therapy of HIV-related diseases."
1896,0.001,1.0000,"Protease inhibitor-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (PI-HAART) has been implicated in dyslipidemia, peripheral insulin resistance, and abnormal adipose tissue deposition in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. In vitro evidence indicates that some PIs reduce adipocyte lipoprotein (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) expression and activities. We examined whether LPL and HL activities are reduced in HIV-infected patients with dyslipidemia. Fasting serum lipids, glucoregulatory hormones, and postheparin LPL and HL activities, as well as whole body and regional adiposity, were measured in 19 HIV-seronegative controls, 9 HIV+ patients naive to all anti-HIV medications, 9 HIV+ patients naive to PIs, 9 HIV+ patients with prior PI experience but not currently receiving PIs, and 47 HIV+ patients receiving PI-HAART. The PI-HAART group had low LPL and HL activities. However, multiple linear regression analysis indicated that low postheparin LPL activity contributed only partially to HIV-dyslipidemia. Central adiposity and high C-peptide levels (an indicator of high insulin secretion) were stronger predictors of HIV-dyslipidemia. Low LPL and HL activities, by themselves, were insufficient to explain HIV-dyslipidemia because the PI-naive group had low LPL and HL activities but had normal adiposity, C-peptide levels, and serum lipid and lipoprotein levels. HDL-cholesterol was lower in PI-HAART and PI-naive groups than seronegative controls and was directly associated with LPL activity. These findings suggest that HIV-dyslipidemia is mediated primarily by factors that influence triglyceride and lipoprotein synthesis (e.g., central adiposity and hyperinsulinemia) and mediated only partially by factors that influence triglyceride clearance (e.g., lipase activity)."
9600,0.001,1.0000,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which causes an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in macaques, is a lentivirus that is morphologically, antigenically, genetically, and biologically similar to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Because of these similarities, the SIV model represents a unique opportunity for in vitro and in vivo testing of antiretroviral agents. Since antiretroviral agents may exhibit different properties in different cells in vitro, more than one cell line may be necessary to evaluate the efficacy and modes of action of an antiretroviral agent. Initially we tested ten cell lines for their permissiveness to five SIV isolates. One B-cell line (AA-2) and one T-cell line (HuT 78) were selected to test antiretroviral agents since both were extremely permissive for SIVmac251, an isolate with a high rate of infectivity. Using this optimized in vitro testing protocol, we screened ten antiretroviral agents for their ability to inhibit SIV replication. Six of the compounds completely inhibited SIV viral antigen expression. Based on the selectivity index, 3'-azido-3'-dideoxythymidine, 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyuridine, and 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine appear to be the most efficacious antiretroviral agents against SIVmac251. Several different assays for determining viral antigen inhibition were conducted and the results of these assays were comparable. Our results demonstrate that the SIV in vitro model is a valuable screening tool for determining the efficacy and toxicity of new antiretroviral agents."
9914,0.001,1.0000,"The effects of cystamine on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) expression in cord blood monocytes-derived macrophages (CBMDM) and lymphocytes were investigated. Cystamine suppressed HIV-1 expression in CBMDM and lymphocytes in a concentration-dependent fashion as determined by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. This inhibitory effect of cystamine occurred with all five HIV-1 strains (both laboratory adopted and fresh isolates) tested in the study. The addition of cystamine to cultures of HIV-1 chronically infected CBMDM also suppressed 80% to 90% of RT activity in comparison with untreated controls. Cystamine also decreased HIV-1 protein expression in CBMDM as determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay. The inhibitory effects of cystamine on HIV-1 did not appear to be caused by toxicity to CBMDM or lymphocytes because there was no change in cell viability or cellular DNA synthesis as evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion and [3H]-thymidine incorporation at doses of cystamine that inhibit the virus. HIV-1 infected CBMDM or lymphocyte cultures (without cystamine treatment) demonstrated giant syncytium formation or cytopathic effect (CPE), respectively, whereas cystamine-treated cultures lacked the giant syncytia or CPE induced by HIV-1 infection. Thus, these observations indicate that cystamine may have the potential to limit HIV-1 replication in monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes in vivo and may represent a potentially useful compound in the treatment of pediatric HIV-1 infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."
590,0.001,1.0000,"Pentoxifylline (Trental), used routinely for the treatment of intermittent claudication, has been shown previously to decrease the levels of tumor necrosis factors-alpha (TNF-alpha) RNA in cancer patients and to lead to a general improvement of well being. Increased TNF-alpha levels have been observed not only in cancer patients but also in cachectic patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and TNF-alpha is known to increase the expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) via activating its long terminal repeat (LTR). Moreover, TNF-alpha decreases the therapeutic efficacy of zidovudine (AZT). Here we show a significant decrease in HIV-1 replication by pentoxifylline in infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The reduction was proportional to the downregulation of expression of a reporter gene, the bacterial gene for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, linked to the HIV-1 LTR in human monocytoid cells. We conclude that patients with AIDS may benefit from pentoxifylline treatment because of its blockage of TNF-alpha-mediated HIV-1 upregulation, from increased efficacy of AZT, and also from improvement in TNF-alpha-induced cachexia."
2464,0.001,1.0000,"Since 2001, antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV (PLHIV) has been available in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). A key factor in the effectiveness of ART is good adherence to the prescribed regimen for both individual well-being and public health. Poor adherence can contribute to the emergence of drug resistant strains of the virus and transmission during risky behaviors. Increased access to ART in low-income country settings has contributed to an interest in treatment adherence in resource-poor contexts. This study aims to investigate the proportion of adherence to ART and identify possible factors related to non-adherence to ART among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Lao PDR."
9476,0.001,1.0000,"Analysis of the viral genome for drug resistance mutations is state-of-the-art for guiding treatment selection for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients. These mutations alter the structure of viral target proteins and reduce or in the worst case completely inhibit the effect of antiretroviral compounds while maintaining the ability for effective replication. Modern anti-HIV-1 regimens comprise multiple drugs in order to prevent or at least delay the development of resistance mutations. However, commonly used HIV-1 genotype interpretation systems provide only classifications for single drugs. The EuResist initiative has collected data from about 18,500 patients to train three classifiers for predicting response to combination antiretroviral therapy, given the viral genotype and further information. In this work we compare different classifier fusion methods for combining the individual classifiers."
4787,0.001,1.0000,"Since its widespread introduction, the hepatitis B vaccine has become an essential part of infant immunization programmes globally. The vaccine has been particularly important for countries where the incidence of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma is high. Effective treatment options for individuals with chronic hepatitis B infection were limited until 1998 when lamivudine, the first nucleoside analogue drug, was introduced. As a single treatment agent, however, lamivudine has a significant drawback: it induces lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus strains that may pose a risk to the global hepatitis B immunization programme. Mutations associated with drug treatment can cause changes to the surface antigen protein, the precise part of the virus that the hepatitis B vaccine mimics. However, the emergence of antiviral drug-associated potential vaccine escape mutants (ADAP-VEMs) in treated patients does not necessarily pose a significant, imminent threat to the global hepatitis B immunization programme. Nonetheless, there is already evidence that current treatment regimens have resulted in the selection of stable ADAP-VEMs. Treatment is currently intended to prevent the long-term complications of hepatitis B virus infection, with little consideration given to potential adverse public health impacts. To address individual and public health concerns, trials are urgently needed to find the optimal combination of existing drugs that are effective but do not induce the emergence of ADAP-VEMs. This paper examines the mechanism of antiviral drug-selected changes in the portion of the viral genome that also affects the surface antigen, and explores their potential impact on current hepatitis B immunization programmes."
4189,0.001,1.0000,"The launch of generic forms of some of the drugs included in fixed-dose combinations of antiretrovirals (FDCA) raises the potential risk of breaking these combinations in order to allow the administration of the new cheaper generic drug. This could result in a step back in some major advances achieved in simplicity and treatment adherence, resulting in an increased risk of selective treatment withdrawal of some of the drugs administered separately. Due to the mechanism of action of the currently available antiretroviral treatment administration must be life-long in infected individuals, both children and adults. FDCA are a significant advance in antiretroviral treatment simplification, contributing to increase compliance of complex chronic therapies, thus increasing the patient's quality of life. They reduce the risk of treatment errors and can also reduce the possibility of unprescribed monotherapy with selective non-compliance. Hence, they contribute to reduce the risk of selection of HIV-1 clones with antiretroviral resistance, a situation that not only compromises future treatment options of the infected individual, but can also be transmitted and are a situation of Public Health concern. Excluding those cases that require a particular dose adjustment, FDCA are a preferred treatment option and their use must be strongly recommended in all scenarios where the components included in the combination are preferred drugs."
8986,0.001,1.0000,"Characterization of residual plasma virus during antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a high priority to improve understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis and therapy. To understand the evolution of HIV-1 pol and env genes in viremic patients under selective pressure of ART, we performed longitudinal analyses of plasma-derived pol and env sequences from single HIV-1 genomes. We tested the hypotheses that drug resistance in pol was unrelated to changes in coreceptor usage (tropism), and that recombination played a role in evolution of viral strains. Recombinants were identified by using Bayesian and other computational methods. High-level genotypic resistance was seen in approximately 70% of X4 and R5 strains during ART. There was no significant association between resistance and tropism. Each patient displayed at least one recombinant encompassing env and representing a change in predicted tropism. These data suggest that, in addition to mutation, recombination can play a significant role in shaping HIV-1 evolution."
2620,0.001,1.0000,"Chemokines and their receptors are key factors in the onset and progression of AIDS. Among them, accumulating evidence strongly indicates the involvement of IL-8 and its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, in AIDS-related conditions. Through extensive investigation of genetic variations of the human CXCR1-CXCR2 locus, we identified a haplotype of the CXCR1 gene (CXCR1-Ha) carrying two nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, CXCR1_300 (Met to Arg) in the N terminus extracellular domain and CXCR1_142 (Arg to Cys) in the C terminus intracellular domain. Transfection experiments with CXCR1 cDNAs corresponding to the CXCR1-Ha and the alternative CXCR1-HA haplotype showed reduced expression of CD4 and CXCR4 in CXCR1-Ha cells in human osteosarcoma cells as well as in Jurkat and CEM human T lymphocytes. Furthermore, the efficiency of X4-tropic HIV-1(NL4-3) infection was significantly lower in CXCR1-Ha cells than in CXCR1-HA cells. The results were further confirmed by a series of experiments using six HIV-1 clinical isolates from AIDS patients. A genetic association study was performed by using an HIV-1(+) patient cohort consisting of two subpopulations of AIDS with extreme phenotypes of rapid and slow progression of the disease. The frequency of the CXCR1-Ha allele is markedly less frequent in patients with rapid disease onset than those with slow progression (P = 0.0003). These results provide strong evidence of a protective role of the CXCR1-Ha allele on disease progression in AIDS, probably acting through modulation of CD4 and CXCR4 expression."
8094,0.001,1.0000,"There is a high prevalence of substance abuse and psychiatric disorders among HIV-infected individuals. Importantly, drug and alcohol-use disorders are frequently co-morbid with depression, anxiety and severe mental illness. Not only do these disorders increase the risk of contracting HIV, they have also been associated with decreased highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) utilisation, adherence and virological suppression. The literature evaluating the relationship between substance abuse and HIV outcomes has primarily focused on injection drug users, although there has been increasing interest in alcohol, cocaine and marijuana. Similarly, the mental health literature has focused largely on depression, with a lesser focus on severe mental illness or anxiety. To date, there is little literature evaluating the association between co-occurring HIV, substance abuse and mental illness on HAART uptake, adherence and virological suppression. Adherence interventions in these populations have demonstrated mixed efficacy. Both directly observed therapy and pharmacist-assisted interventions appear promising, as do integrated behavioural interventions. However, the current intervention literature has several limitations: few of these studies are randomised, controlled trials; the sample sizes have generally been small; and co-occurring substance abuse and mental illness has not specifically been targeted in these studies. Future studies examining individual substances of abuse, psychiatric disorders and co-occurring substance abuse and psychiatric disorders on HIV outcomes will inform targeted adherence interventions."

8861,0.001,1.0000,"In 1994, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) recommended the use of zidovudine (ZDV) to reduce perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission; in 1995, USPHS recommended universal prenatal HIV counseling and voluntary testing. Widespread implementation of these recommendations, together with increased use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and scheduled cesarean delivery, has resulted in substantial declines in perinatal HIV transmission. However, perinatal HIV transmission continues to occur. To identify missed prevention opportunities, CDC analyzed the incidence of perinatal HIV infection among a cohort of HIV-exposed infants born during 1997-2000 at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, Georgia. This report describes the results of that analysis and underscores the challenges to universal prevention of infant HIV infections. Efforts to reduce perinatal HIV transmission should focus on increasing prenatal care rates, promoting adherence to recommended treatment regimens during pregnancy, and increasing prenatal HIV testing, particularly in areas where missed opportunities for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission persist."

This new clinical syndrome among HIV-infected patients is associated with underlying co-infections with mycobacteria, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B and C infections, etc.... We report on an HIV/tuberculosis (TB) co-infected patient who developed an immune restoration inflammatory syndrome after initiation of HAART and anti-TB treatment. She developed fever, large abscesses and pleural and peritoneal effusions. Systemic symptoms decreased during corticosteroid treatment, but abscesses only disappeared 8 months after the start of the anti-TB treatment."
1102,0.001,1.0000,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in innate immunity against pathogens. Their stimulation induces the activation of NF-κB, an important inducer of HIV-1 replication. In recent years, an increasing number of studies using several cells types from HIV-infected patients indicate that TLRs play a key role in regulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and viral pathogenesis. In the present study, the effect of HIV-1 stimulation of monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subpopulations from healthy donors on the expression and functions of TLR2 and TLR4 was examined. In addition, and to complete the in vitro study, the expression pattern of TLR2 and TLR4 in 49 HIV-1-infected patients, classified according to viral load and the use of HAART, was determined and compared with 25 healthy subjects. An increase of TLR expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines were observed in MDMs and PBMCs infected with HIV-1 in vitro and in response to TLR stimulation, compared to the mock. In addition, an association between TLR expression and up-regulation of CD80 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) was observed. The ex vivo analysis indicated increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), but only of TLR2 in monocytes obtained from HIV-1-infected patients, compared to healthy subjects. Remarkably, the expression was higher in cells from patients who do not use HAART. In monocytes, there was a positive correlation between both TLRs and viral load, but not CD4(+) T cell numbers. Together, our in vitro and ex vivo results suggest that TLR expression and function can be up-regulated in response to HIV-1 infection and could affect the inflammatory response. We propose that modulation of TLRs represents a mechanism to promote HIV-1 replication or AIDS progression in HIV-1-infected patients."
2780,0.001,1.0000,"The number of HIV-positive people aged ≥50 years is rising each year. We measured the prevalence of non-infectious illnesses and their risk factors and described healthcare use in this UK population. A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at an outpatient HIV specialist clinic in south east England. Patients age ≥50 years were invited to complete questionnaires measuring demographics, non-infectious illnesses, medication use, lifestyle and healthcare utilisation. The response rate was 67%. Of 299 participants, 84% reported ≥1 comorbid condition and 61% reported ≥2 (multimorbidity). Most commonly reported were high cholesterol, sexual dysfunction, hypertension and depression. In multivariate analyses, age, number of years HIV-positive and duration of antiretroviral therapy remained significant predictors of comorbidity when controlling for lifestyle factors (exercise, smoking and use of recreational drugs and alcohol). Use of non-HIV healthcare services was associated with increasing comorbidity, a longer duration of HIV and recreational drug use. The majority of HIV-patients aged ≥50 years reported multiple comorbidities and this was associated with polypharmacy and increased use of non-HIV services. Further research examining the quality, safety and patient experience of healthcare is needed to inform development of services to optimally meet the needs of older HIV-positive patients."

We partially sequenced the reverse transcriptase region of the HIV-1 pol gene from a total of 54 Kenyan patients aged 18-56 years who continued highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) for between 8 and 102 months. Subtyping was done using both the JPHMM tool and phylogenetic method. HIV-1 subtype A1 was the predominant strain in circulation, representing 57.4% and 70.4% of all isolates as determined by JPHMM and phylogenetic methods, respectively. Subtypes D (14.8%, 7.4%), C (5.6%, 9.3%), and A2 (0%, 5.6%) were determined at respective prevalence by both methods. JPHMM identified 22.2% of the isolates as recombinants. This surveillance focused on the RT gene and reaffirms the predominance of subtype A and an increasing proportion of recombinant strains in the Kenyan epidemic. "

If current trends continue, AIDS can be expected to move into the top five leading causes of death in the pediatric and adolescent age group in the next 3 or 4 years. To address this problem and also to provide focus for the US Department of Health and Human Services activities dealing with pediatric AIDS, an intradepartmental work group was established as a central health and human services component.

4574,0.001,1.0000,"Optimal testing strategies for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection and the administration of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) remain uncertain among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. A 4-year prospective study was conducted among Thai HIV-infected patients who underwent simultaneous tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube Test (QFT-IT) at care entry. Based on baseline test results, patients were categorized into the following 4 groups: i) QFT-IT-positive, TST-reactive; ii) QFT-IT-positive, TST-non-reactive; iii) QFT-IT-negative, TST-reactive; and iv) QFT-IT-negative, TST-non-reactive. The QFT-IT-positive patients were offered 9-month IPT and were QFT-IT tested annually. Of the 150 enrolled patients, 8, 12, 16, and 114 patients were assigned to groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Sixteen of 19 QFT-IT-positive patients (84%) completed IPT. The incidence of tuberculosis was significantly higher in patients who declined IPT than in those underwent treatment (11.11 vs. 0 case/100 patient-year; P ＜ 0.001). Among the 16 patients completing IPT, 11 (69%) and 2 (12%) had QFT-IT reversion at 1 and 2 years after IPT, respectively. The remaining 3 (19%) did not demonstrate any reversion, and their baseline interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels were above 1.2 IU/mL. Initial QFT-IT-guided IPT was effective in preventing tuberculosis. Serial QFT-IT for evaluating IPT effectiveness had limitations because of delayed or lack of reversion, especially for patients with high baseline IFN-γ levels."
5464,0.001,1.0000,"DNA sequences encoding the C2 to V3 region of envelope glycoprotein gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were amplified by PCR from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 24 of 25 HIV-1-seropositive patients from Cyprus. By using a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA), all amplified products were studied genetically and compared with 16 previously characterized HIV-1 strains belonging to subtypes A through F. HMA results revealed that HIV-1 gp120 sequences from 15 of our patients were of subtype B of HIV-1, whereas one isolate was of subtype C. However, gp120 sequences from eight patients had no obvious similarities to the known subtypes as defined by HMA. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of molecular clones confirmed the HMA results and placed the eight undefined HIV-1 isolates into three distinct genetic clusters. On the basis of branch topology and lengths of the phylogenetic tree, we conclude that one group consisting of three clones from two patients represents a new HIV-1 env subtype, which we have termed subtype I. The remaining two sequence clusters, consisting of five sequences from four patients and two sequences from two other patients, are distally related to subtypes A and F. These data demonstrate the extensive heterogeneity of HIV-1 in Cyprus, including the presence of new subtype."
8377,0.001,1.0000,"The addition of adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) to ongoing lamivudine therapy is effective against lamivudine-resistant virus in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We studied 39 patients who received ADV added to lamivudine for breakthrough hepatitis. We determined early viral changes (12 weeks) in YMDD mutants (rtM204I [YIDD sequence], rtM204V [YVDD]) and rtL180M in all 39 patients as well as amino acid changes in the polymerase reverse transcriptase (rt) region and precore/core promoter mutations in 15 patients who received long-term treatment (more than 1 year). Changes in rtM204I and rtL180M viral loads were greater than that of the rtM204V, albeit statistically insignificant. Moreover, the greatest change in viral load was seen for rtM204I without hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). The precore mutant was replaced with wild-type virus in three of eight patients after 1 year of added ADV therapy. Compared to baseline with lamivudine therapy only, new amino acid mutations were seen in the rt region at baseline with ADV in seven patients. At 1 year after ADV coadministration, the YMDD motif was replaced with wild-type (rt204M) in two patients, in whom mutations were fewer and of a different type. We conclude that the rtM204I may be more sensitive to ADV in vivo. ADV tended to select wild-type virus from precore mutants. Moreover, viruses that were wild-type in the rt region reappeared after 1 year of ADV coadministration in some patients."
996,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B continues to be a global problem, with an estimated 240 million cases according to the World Health Organization. Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are currently several US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for treating chronic hepatitis B, with Lamivudine (LAM) being the first oral agent made available. The major problem with LAM is significantly decreased effectiveness over time due to the development of anti-HBV resistance that can lead to virologic and biochemical breakthrough as well as hepatitis B flare, progression of liver disease, and decompensation of pre-existing cirrhosis. Despite its high anti-HBV resistant rate, LAM remains widely used in underdeveloped countries due to its wide availability and low cost compared to other antiviral medications, including those that are more effective. Therefore, it is still clinically important to learn how to prevent and treat LAM resistant strains of HBV. Several regimens with the other available antiviral agents have been studied, including switching to monotherapy with either Adefovir, Entecavir, or Tenofovir, adding Adefovir to LAM, and switching to a combination of Adefovir and Entecavir. This review article will examine molecular mechanisms and diagnosis of LAM anti-HBV resistance, risks for and approaches to reduce LAM anti-HBV resistance, and currently available rescue therapy regimens for LAM resistance.

4636,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading cause of liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) play an important role in the regulation of immune response against infectious organisms, including HBV. Recently, several genome-wide association (GWAS) studies have shown that genetic variations in HLA genes influence disease progression in HBV infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of HLA genetic polymorphisms and their possible role in HBV infection in Saudi Arabian patients. Variations in HLA genes were screened in 1672 subjects who were divided according to their clinical status into six categories as follows; clearance group, inactive carriers, active carriers, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and uninfected healthy controls. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belonged to HLA-DQ region (rs2856718, rs7453920 and rs9275572) and two SNPs belonged to HLA-DP (rs3077 and rs9277535) were studied. The SNPs were genotyped by PCR-based DNA sequencing (rs2856718) and allele specific TaqMan genotyping assays (rs3077, rs7453920, rs9277535 and rs9275572). The results showed that rs2856718, rs3077, rs9277535 and rs9275572 were associated with HBV infection (p = 0.0003, OR = 1.351, CI = 1.147-1.591; p = 0.041, OR = 1.20, CI = 1.007-1.43; p = 0.045, OR = 1.198, CI = 1.004-1.43 and p = 0.0018, OR = 0.776, CI = 0.662-0.910, respectively). However, allele frequency of rs2856718, rs7453920 and rs9275572 were found more in chronically infected patients when compared to clearance group infection (p = 0.0001, OR = 1.462, CI = 1.204-1.776; p = 0.0178, OR = 1.267, CI = 1.042-1.540 and p = 0.010, OR = 0.776, CI = 0.639-0.942, respectively). No association was found when polymorphisms in HLA genes were compared in active carriers versus cirrhosis/HCC patients. In conclusion, these results suggest that variations in HLA genes could affect susceptibility to and clearance of HBV infection in Saudi Arabian patients. "

5585,0.001,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to determine the self-reported prevalence of needlestick injuries among practicing electromyographers. In January 2008, an anonymous electronic survey was sent to all active members of the American Association for Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) who provided e-mail addresses to the Association. Eight hundred and eight members (56% neurologists, 43% physiatrists; 97% practicing physicians, 3% trainees) responded, with a response rate of 22% (808 of 3659). The mean number of years in practice, involving electromyography (EMG) at least 1 day per week, was 16 years. A majority of physicians (64%) reported at least one needlestick injury involving EMG, and 8% reported five or more injuries. Needlestick injuries involving patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), hepatitis B, and/or hepatitis C occurred in 1 of every 11 electromyographers. Nearly half of all respondents (44%) who experienced a needlestick injury stated that they did not report at least one injury event to official centers. Injuries were most likely to occur during a routine procedure (45%) or when a patient moved (26%). The most common preventable reason for injury was a perceived lack of time."
178,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype G (HBV/G) was detected in sera from four individuals by polymerase chain reaction with hemi-nested primers deduced from an insertion of 36 nt in the core gene that is specific for this genotype. Despite two stop codons in the precore region characteristic of HBV/G, all patients were positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in serum. When 10 HBV clones were propagated from one patient, and sequenced within precore region and a section of the core gene, 6 clones were HBV/G while 2 were genotype A (HBV/A); a recombination between HBV/G and HBV/A occurred in the remaining 2 clones. Mixed infection of HBV/G and HBV/A, as well as the recombination, was demonstrated in the sequence of preS1 and preS2 regions also. Coinfection with HBV/G and HBV/A was demonstrated in the other three patients, and their recombination in two patients. Ten HBV clones were propagated from one patient at two time points separated by 1 year. Clones of HBV/A, HBV/G and their recombination were found in 9 : 1 : 0 when the patient was positive for HBeAg, while the proportion shifted to 0 : 8 : 2 after the patient seroconverted to anti-HBe. In conclusion, HBV/G is frequently found as a coinfection with HBV/A. This coinfection would explain the presence of HBeAg in individuals infected with HBV/G. Along with seroconversion to anti-HBe, HBV/G would be selected accompanied by the recombination with HBV/A. Further studies should be performed to confirm these findings."

A total of 641 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative and HBeAg-positive patients (129 with HVL) received 48 weeks of TDF 300 mg (HVL n = 82) or adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) 10 mg (HVL n = 47), followed by open-label TDF for an additional 192 weeks. Patients with confirmed HBV DNA ≥ 400 copies/mL on or after week 72 had the option of adding emtricitabine (FTC). By week 240, 98.3% of HVL and 99.2% of non-HVL patients on treatment achieved HBV DNA <400 copies/mL. Both groups had similar rates of histologic regression between baseline and week 240. Patients with HVL generally took longer to achieve HBV DNA <400 copies/mL than non-HVL patients, but by week 96, the percentages of patients with HBV DNA <400 copies/mL were similar in both groups. Among HVL patients, time to achieving HBV DNA <400 copies/mL was shorter among those initially receiving TDF, compared to ADV. No patient with baseline HVL had persistent viremia at week 240 or amino acid substitutions associated with TDF resistance."

Additionally, we wanted to examine the current frequency of blood exposure, reporting habits and hepatitis B vaccination status in the staff. Of 1439 eligible hospital staffs included, 960 (67%) were HCWs. The overall human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-, hepatitis C Virus (HCV)- and hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-prevalence was 0% (0/1439), 0.14% (2/1439) and 1.6% (23/1439), respectively. Twenty-three percent of HCWs were vaccinated against HBV. Age, blood transfusion and stay in endemic areas were associated independently to HBV infection as opposed to job-category, duration of employment, HBV vaccination status and blood exposure. Based on a 4-week recall period, the incidence of percutaneous blood exposure was 1.5/person-year. In conclusion the HIV and hepatitis prevalence was low despite frequent blood exposure and the principal risk factors were unrelated to work. Danish HCWs do not seem to be at increased risk of hepatitis B even though universal HBV vaccination has not been implemented."
6304,0.001,1.0000,"In Italy, although the most recent guidelines stress the importance of screening for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) those subjects considered to be at high risk (e.g., injecting drug users), not all drug users being treated at public drug dependency centres are regularly tested for these infections. The results of the present study show that 7.2%, 13.0%, and 7.4% of injecting drug users seeking treatment at public drug dependency centres are not tested for, respectively, HIV, HBV and HCV infections and while corresponding figures for drug users who do not inject drugs are 20.3%, 25.1% and 16.2%. The failure to undergo testing among injectors was associated with a shorter history of drug use and with drug centres in central or southern Italy; these associations were also found among non-injectors, with the addition of low level of education. The results stress the importance of facilitating access to testing, of providing the drug dependency centres with the necessary resources for taking blood samples at the centres themselves, of making access to (and performance of) testing uniform throughout the country, and of removing obstacles that can lead to the drug user's refusal to undergo testing."
5673,0.001,1.0000,"Initiation of efavirenz-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is associated with Vitamin D deficiency, but the risk factors including efavirenz pharmacokinetics for cART-induced severe vitamin D deficiency (SVDD) and the impact of anti-tuberculosis (TB) cotreatment are not explored. We investigated the prevalence of SVDD in HIV and TB-HIV coinfected patients and associated risk factors for treatment-induced SVDD.Treatment-naïve Ethiopian HIV patients with (n = 102) or without (n = 89) TB co-infection were enrolled prospectively and received efavirenz-based cART. In TB-HIV coinfected patients, rifampicin-based anti-TB treatment was initiated 4 or 8 weeks before starting cART. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D), cholesterol and 4-beta hydroxycholesterol concentrations were measured at baseline, 4, 16, and 48 week of cART. Plasma efavirenz concentrations were determined at 4 and 16 weeks of cART.TB-HIV patients had significantly lower plasma 25 (OH)D3 levels than HIV-only patients at baseline. TB co-infection, low Karnofsky score, high viral load, and high CYP3A activity as measured by plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratios were significant predictors of low 25 (OH)D3 levels at baseline. In HIV-only patients, initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVVD from 27% at baseline to 76%, 79%, and 43% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively. The median 25 (OH)D3 levels declined from baseline by -40%, -50%, and -14% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively.In TB-HIV patients, previous anti-TB therapy had no influence on 25 (OH)D3 levels, but the initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVDD from 57% at baseline to 70% and 72% at the 4 and 16 weeks of cART, respectively. Median plasma 25 (OH)D3 declined from baseline by -17% and -21% at week 4 and 16 of cART, respectively.Our results indicate low plasma cholesterol, high CYP3A activity, and high plasma efavirenz concentrations as significant predictors of early efavirenz-based cART-induced vitamin D deficiency. Low plasma 25 (OH)D3 level at baseline is associated with TB co-infection and HIV diseases progression. Initiation of efavirenz-based cART is associated with high incidence of SVDD, whereas rifampicin based anti-TB therapy co-treatment has no significant effect. Supplementary vitamin D during cART initiation may be beneficial for HIV patients regardless of TB coinfection. "
7348,0.001,1.0000,"Entrenched economic and gender inequities together are driving a globally expanding, increasingly female, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS epidemic. To date, significant population-level declines in HIV transmission have not been observed, at least in part because most approaches to prevention have presumed a degree of individual control in decision making that does not speak to the reality of women's and girls' circumstances in many parts of the world. Such efforts have paid insufficient attention to critical characteristics of the risk environment, most notably poverty and gender power inequities. Even fewer interventions have addressed specific mechanisms through which these inequities engender risky sexual practices that result in women's disproportionately increased vulnerabilities to HIV infection. This article focuses on identifying those mechanisms, or structural pathways, that stem from the interactions between poverty and entrenched gender inequities and recommending strategies to address and potentially modify those pathways. We highlight four such structural pathways to HIV risk, all of which could be transformed: (1) lack of access to critical information and health services for HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention, (2) limited access to formal education and skill development, (3) intimate partner violence, and (4) the negative consequences of migration prompted by insufficient economic resources. We argue for interventions that enhance women's access to education, training, employment, and HIV/STI prevention information and tools; minimize migration; and by working with men and communities, at the same time reduce women's poverty and promote gender-equitable norms. In conclusion, we identify challenges in developing and evaluating strategies to address these structural pathways."
8086,0.001,1.0000,"In recent years, increasing numbers of patients infected with HIV-1 non-B subtypes have been treated with modern antiretroviral regimens. Therefore, a better knowledge of HIV drug resistance in non-B strains is crucial. Thus, we compared the mutational pathways involved in drug resistance among the most common non-B subtypes in Italy (F, C, and CRF02_AG) and the B subtype. In total, 2234 pol sequences from 1231 virologically failing patients from Central Italy were analyzed. The prevalence of resistance mutations in protease and reverse transcriptase between non-B and B subtypes has been evaluated. Among patients treated with nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and with thymidine analogues (TA) experience, TAMs1 M41L and L210W were less prevalent in CRF02_AG, while TAMs2 T215F and K219E were more prevalent in the F subtype. In NRTI-treated patients having experience with abacavir, didanosine, tenofovir, or stavudine the K65R mutation was mostly prevalent in the C subtype. In non-NRTI (NNRTI)-treated patients infected by the C subtype the prevalence of K103N was lower than in patients infected with other subtypes, while the prevalence of Y181C and Y188L was higher compared to subtype B. The prevalence of Y181C was higher also in subtype F as compared to subtype B. In patients treated with protease inhibitors, L89V was predominantly found in CRF02_AG, while the TPV resistance mutation T74P was predominantly found in the C subtype. Some differences in the genotypic drug resistance have been found among patients infected with B, C, F, and CRF02_AG subtypes in relationship to treatment. These results may be useful for the therapeutic management of individuals infected with HIV-1 non-B strains."
9894,0.001,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy has dramatically reduced mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In 1988, the suggestion that the first antiretroviral drug, zidovudine, was the potential cause of muscle pathology in HIV-infected persons resulted in structural and biochemical patient studies demonstrating acquired mitochondrial dysfunction. Assessment of subsequent nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) antiretroviral drugs has indicated that mitochondria are a common target of NRTI toxicity in multiple tissues, leading to a wide variety of pathology ranging from lipodystrophy to neuropathy. Overwhelmingly, these complications have emerged during post-licensing human studies. Subsequent animal and in vitro studies have then elucidated the potential pathological mechanisms, suggesting that NRTI-associated mitochondrial toxicity arises principally from inhibition of the sole mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma, leading to a reduction in mtDNA content (depletion). Millions of patients have been treated with mitochondrially toxic NRTIs and these drugs remain the backbone of antiretroviral rollout in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Here we describe the 25-year history of antiretroviral associated mitochondrial pathology and critically review the strength of evidence linking clinical, histopathological, and molecular data. We discuss recently described novel mechanisms of NRTI-associated mitochondrial damage and whether or not recently licensed NRTIs may be considered free from mitochondrial toxicity. "
6649,0.001,1.0000,"HIV subtype C is the most prevalent subtype in the world. Despite its recent expansion in Brazil, HIV-1C already prevails in the southernmost state of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul. This unique HIV epidemiology has prompted us to characterize that population. Seventy-seven HIV-1-infected subjects attending the largest HIV/AIDS clinic of the state had the protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes of their virus subtyped and genotyped. When subtype-specific infections were plotted according to year of diagnosis, the prevalence of subtype C was shown to increase over the last 18 years of the epidemic, along with a concomitant decrease of subtype B. Comparison of subtype C-infected treated and untreated subjects revealed amino acid differences in protease and RT, especially in the RT mutation D/G123S. The overall analysis of drug resistance mutations in viruses from treated subjects has highlighted some associations between subtypes and particular mutations, such as V82A/F/T/S in protease and subtype F1 and M41L and L210W in RT and subtype B. The characterization of this important population, which is one of a few in the developing world where a large number of HIV-1C-infected subjects are under antiretroviral treatment, underscores its potential usefulness in clinical, treatment, and vaccine trials in Brazil."
17,0.001,1.0000,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of newborn rhesus macaques is a useful animal model of human immunodeficiency virus infection for the study of the emergence and clinical implications of drug-resistant viral mutants. We previously demonstrated that SIV-infected infant macaques receiving prolonged treatment with 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (PMPA) developed viral mutants with fivefold reduced susceptibility to PMPA in vitro and that the development of these mutants was associated with the development of a K65R mutation and additional compensatory mutations in reverse transcriptase (RT). To study directly the virulence and clinical implications of these SIV mutants, two uncloned SIVmac isolates with similar fivefold reduced in vitro susceptibilities to PMPA but distinct RT genotypes, SIVmac055 (K65R, N69T, R82K A158S,S211N) and SIVmac385 (K65R, N69S, I118V), were each inoculated intravenously into six newborn rhesus macaques; 3 weeks later, three animals of each group were started on PMPA treatment. All six untreated animals developed persistently high levels of viremia and fatal immunodeficiency within 4 months. In contrast, the six PMPA-treated animals, despite having persistently high virus levels, survived significantly longer: 5 to 9 months for the three SIVmac055-infected infants and > or = 21 months for the three SIVmac385-infected infants. Virus from only one untreated animal demonstrated reversion to wild-type susceptibility and loss of the K65R mutation. In several other animals, additional RT mutations, including K64R and Y115F, were detected, but the biological role of these mutations is unclear since they did not affect the in vitro susceptibility of the virus to PMPA. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that although SIVmac mutants with the PMPA-selected K65R mutation in RT were highly virulent, PMPA treatment still offered strong therapeutic benefits. These results suggest that the potential emergence of HIV mutants with reduced susceptibility to PMPA in patients during prolonged PMPA therapy may not eliminate its therapeutic benefits."
8068,0.001,1.0000,"Genomic hypermutation of RNA viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), can be provoked by intrinsic and extrinsic pressures, which lead to the inhibition of viral replication and/or the progression of viral diversity. Human APOBEC3G was identified as an HIV-1 restriction factor, which edits nascent HIV-1 DNA by inducing G-to-A hypermutations and debilitates the infectivity of vif-deficient HIV-1. On the other hand, HIV-1 Vif protein has the robust potential to degrade APOBEC3G protein. Although subsequent investigations have revealed that lines of APOBEC3 family proteins have the capacity to mutate HIV-1 DNA, it remains unclear whether these endogenous APOBEC3s, including APOBEC3G, contribute to mutations of vif-proficient HIV-1 provirus in vivo and, if so, what is the significance of these mutations. In this study, we use a human hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse (NOG-hCD34 mouse) model and demonstrate the predominant accumulation of G-to-A mutations in vif-proficient HIV-1 provirus displaying characteristics of APOBEC3-mediated mutagenesis. Notably, the APOBEC3-associated G-to-A mutation of HIV-1 DNA that leads to the termination of translation was significantly observed. We further provide a novel insight suggesting that HIV-1 G-to-A hypermutation is independently induced by individual APOBEC3 proteins. In contrast to the prominent mutation in intracellular proviral DNA, viral RNA in plasma possessed fewer G-to-A mutations. Taken together, these results provide the evidence indicating that endogenous APOBEC3s are associated with G-to-A mutation of HIV-1 provirus in vivo, which can result in the abrogation of HIV-1 infection."
7394,0.001,1.0000,"In the USA and West Europe, nearly 80% of HIV-1-infected adults, experiencing virologic failure, harbored virus strain resistant to at least one antiretroviral drug. Limited data are available on antiretroviral drug resistance in pediatric HIV infection. The aims of this study were to analyze prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and to identify risk factors associated with resistance in this population. Prevalence of genotypic resistance was estimated retrospectively in treated children who experienced virologic failure (with HIV-1-RNA > 500 copies/ml) followed in Necker hospital between 2001 and 2003. Among 119 children with resistance testing, prevalence of resistance to any drug was 82.4%. Resistance ranged from 76.5% to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), to 48.7% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and 42.9% to protease inhibitor (PI). Resistance to at least one drug of two classes and three classes (triple resistance) was 31.9 and 26.9%, respectively. Resistance was not associated with geographic origin, HIV-1 subtype, and CDC status. In multivariate analysis, resistance to any drug remained associated independently with current low viral load and high lifetime number of past PI. Triple resistance was independently associated with the high lifetime number of past PI and with gender, particularly among children aged 11 years old or more with a prevalence seven times higher in boys than in girls. In conclusion, antiretroviral resistance is common among treated HIV-1-infected children and prevalence was similar with those observed in adult population in the same year period. However, adolescent boys seem to be at greater risk."
1352,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide. In Egypt, the incidence of HCC has doubled over the last decade. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays a key role in cancer invasion and metastasis by degrading the extracellular matrix and basement membrane barriers. A cytosine (C)/thymidine (T) single nucleotide polymorphism at position -1562 in the MMP-9 promoter is reported to influence the expression of the MMP-9 gene. The association between MMP-9 gene polymorphisms and HCC patients with hepatitis C and B viruses (HCV and HBV) was examined in 91 patients with HCC and viral hepatitis (55 HCV and 36 HBV). The results were compared with those of 42 HCC patients without viral hepatitis and 60 healthy individuals with no liver infection. Polymorphisms of the MMP-9 gene were investigated by polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The serum MMP-9 level was quantitatively determined using a human MMP-9 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which showed that homozygosity of the MMP-9 promoter (TT) was more frequent in patients with HCC and chronic HCV or HBV infection when compared with the control group (49.1, 52.8, and 35.7%, respectively). In addition, we observed significant elevation of serum MMP-9 levels in all HCC groups compared to controls. It was concluded that patients with the MMP-9 TT genotype are at risk of developing HCC and HBV or HCV. People with significantly elevated serum levels of MMP-9 are at risk of developing HCC. "
9288,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatocarcinogenesis is heavily influenced by chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) infection. Elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (SERPINE1/PAI-1) have been reported in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with viral infection. The gene encoding SERPINE1 is highly polymorphic and the frequently associated 4/5 guanosine (4G/5G) polymorphism in the gene promoter may influence its expression. Here, we investigated the distribution of genotypes and the frequency of alleles of the 4G/5G polymorphism in patients with HCC, the influence of the 4G/5G polymorphism on plasma SERPINE1 levels and its association with viral infection. A total of 75 patients with HCC were enrolled: 32 (42.6%) were HBV(+)/HCV(+), 11 (14.6%) were only HCV(+), and 32 (42.6%) were negative for both viruses. A control group of healthy donors was also enrolled (n=50). SERPINE1 plasma concentrations were determined by ELISA and the detection of the promoter 4G/5G polymorphism was performed by an allele-specific PCR analysis. We found that the frequency of both the 4G/4G genotype (p=0.02) and the 4G allele (p=0.006) were significantly higher in patients with HCC compared to the control group, and particularly higher in patients with HCC co-infected with HBV(+)/HCV(+) than in those with no viral infection. We also found that patients with the 4G/4G genotype had significantly higher plasma SERPINE1 protein levels when compared with patients with the 4G/5G or 5G/5G genotype (p<0.001). Differences in frequency of 4G allele and genetic variability of 4G/5G SERPINE1 polymorphism with a higher level of SERPINE1 protein in patients with HCC with HBV(+)/HCV(+) than those without infection, suggest the presence of two distinct pathogenic mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis, depending on the etiology."
6366,0.001,1.0000,"Open node biopsy was the method of choice for diagnosing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection before serologic testing became available. Currently, the otolaryngologist is often called on to assist in the management of HIV-positive patients with troublesome cervical adenopathy. Today's questions are: what is the place of fine-needle aspiration (FNA), and when is open cervical node biopsy indicated. A retrospective review was undertaken of 93 consecutive cervical node biopsies performed by our department during the 5-year period from 1985 to 1989. Twenty of the patients who underwent biopsy were HIV-positive. Of these twenty, ten carried an established diagnosis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Seventeen of these patients underwent FNA before biopsy. In the eight patients with persistent generalized lymph-adenopathy (PGL) and nontender, nonenlarging nodes, pathologic analysis revealed lymphoid hyperplasia. Five of these patients had antecedent FNA, none demonstrating any pathologic changes. Of the twelve patients with enlarging or tendon nodes, the diagnosis of mycobacterial adenitis was made in eight, Nocardial infection in two, Burkitt's lymphoma in one, and metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma in one. In four of the patients diagnosed with mycobacterial infections, FNA yielded cytologic evidence of acid-fast bacilli and open lymph node biopsy added nothing. In contrast, FNA failed to reveal the diagnosis in both patients with Nocardial infection, and in the two patients with neoplastic disease. We conclude that cervical node biopsy is not indicated in the HIV or AIDS patient with nontender or nonenlarging nodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
4229,0.001,1.0000,"Reactivation of hepatitis B is characterized by a sudden increase in hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication in a patient with prior evidence of resolved or inactive HBV infection. Although HBV reactivation can occur spontaneously, it usually occurs after chemotherapy, immunosuppression (organ transplantation) or an alteration in immune function (therapy for autoimmune disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection). The clinical presentation cases can vary, ranging from a subclinical, asymptomatic course to severe acute hepatitis and even death. Although reactivation of HBV is mainly found in HBsAg-positive patients, it can be observed in serologically recovered anti-hepatitis B core antibody (HBc)-positive, HBsAg-negative patients. Serum HBV DNA typically increases during immune suppression, followed by a disease flare and HBV DNA clearance following immune restoration after immune suppression is stopped. In organ transplant recipients, without immune reconstitution, high HBV DNA levels can lead to fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis related to the direct cytopathic effect of HBV. Several randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown that reactivation can be prevented by lamivudine prophylaxis. Screening for HBsAg and anti-HBc should be performed before beginning immunosuppressive treatment and routine prophylaxis is recommended in HBsAg-positive patients. The optimal duration of prophylaxis remains to be determined. In anti-HBc-positive patients with or without anti-hepatitis B surface antigen, alanine transaminase and HBV DNA levels should be closely monitored and antiviral therapy should be started when HBV reactivation is confirmed. The use of new more potent nucleos(t)ides analogues with lower resistance rates would seem to be logical; however, experience with these drugs in the prophylaxis and treatment of severe HBV reactivation is limited."
2979,0.001,1.0000,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are stably present in human serum. The relationship between circulating miRNAs and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected liver disease has not been previously reported. Applied Biosystems array-based miRNA expression profiling was performed on pooled sera obtained from identified groups of chronic asymptomatic carriers (ASC), patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and HBV-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), as well as healthy controls (HC). Nine miRNAs were verified in more clinical samples by RT-PCR. The correlation between miRNAs expression and the relationship between miRNA levels and clinical characteristics was analysed. Results showed that circulating miRNAs were detected in all disease and control samples, and their numbers increased with symptom severity, from 37 in HC, 77 in ASC, 101 in CHB, to 135 in ACLF. The expression levels of most miRNAs were also up-regulated in HBV-infected patients when compared to HC. Expression of the liver-specific miR-122 was significantly up-regulated in HBV-infected patients. Concomitant regulation of miRNAs not in clusters was disrupted by HBV infection. However, such disruption was not observed for miRNAs in paralogous clusters. Furthermore, the level of miRNAs in the CHB serum was up-regulated most in hepatitis B e antigen-positive patients. The expression levels of miR-122 and miR-194 correlated negatively with the age of patients with CHB or ACLF. Functional analysis showed that miR-122 could inhibit HBV replication in Huh7 and HepG2 cells. In all, our study revealed that a number of miRNAs were differentially expressed during HBV infection and underscored the potential importance of miR-122 in the infection process."

We identify a novel locus at 8p21.3 (index rs7000921, odds ratio=0.78, P=3.2 × 10(-12)). Furthermore, we identify significant expression quantitative trait locus associations for INTS10 gene at 8p21.3. We demonstrate that INST10 suppresses HBV replication via IRF3 in liver cells. In clinical plasma samples, we confirm that INST10 levels are significantly decreased in PIs compared with SRs, and negatively correlated with the HBV load. These findings highlight a novel antiviral gene INTS10 at 8p21.3 in the clearance of HBV infection."
3727,0.001,1.0000,"Genotyping of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) for antiretroviral drug resistance is routinely used both in clinical practice, to guide the selection of options for an individual's antiretroviral therapy, and in epidemiological studies, to estimate levels of antiretroviral drug resistance in a patient population. However, reliance on results of a single test can result in an underestimation of antiretroviral drug resistance. In the present study, we quantified the prevalence of resistance-associated mutations found in recent genotypic tests of 1734 HIV-1-infected, treatment-experienced subjects who had at least 3 genotypic tests (n = 11,404 genotypic tests total; median, 5 tests/subject) and compared it with that of resistance-associated mutations ever detected in these subjects between 1996 and 2004. Single-point analyses underestimated antiretroviral drug resistance, particularly for nucleoside analogues, in both individuals and patient populations. For example, the prevalence of resistance-associated mutation M184V/I was 25.5% in the most recent genotypes and 58.8% in available historical genotypes. Our results suggest that analysis of a combined historical genotype rather than of a cross-sectional genotype may lead to more accurate estimates of antiretroviral drug resistance in individual patients and in patient populations."
3028,0.001,1.0000,"Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the risk of drug-sensitive HIV transmission but may increase the transmission of drug-resistant HIV. We used a mathematical model to estimate the long-term population-level benefits of ART and determine the scenarios under which earlier ART (treatment at 1 year post-infection, on average) could decrease simultaneously both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence (new infections). We constructed an infection-age-structured mathematical model that tracked the transmission rates over the course of infection and modelled the patients' life expectancy as a function of ART initiation timing. We fitted this model to the annual AIDS incidence and death data directly, and to resistance data and demographic data indirectly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco. Using counterfactual scenarios, we assessed the impact on total and drug-resistant HIV incidence of ART initiation timing, frequency of acquired drug resistance, and second-line drug effectiveness (defined as the combination of resistance monitoring, biomedical drug efficacy and adherence). Earlier ART initiation could decrease the number of both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence when second-line drug effectiveness is sufficiently high (greater than 80%), but increase the proportion of new infections that are drug resistant. Thus, resistance may paradoxically appear to be increasing while actually decreasing."
7884,0.001,1.0000,"The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of adherence to prescribed antiretroviral therapy on virologic response measured repeatedly over time in HIV-infected patients. To this end observations on plasma viral load (HIV RNA) assessed in copies/ml are categorized into four clinically meaningful states, [0--50[, [50--400[, [400--2000[, [2000 and up. A time-dependent continuation ratio model is used to analyse longitudinal ordinal responses. The main challenge lies in modelling dependencies over time and using information contained in the data efficiently to establish a dynamic relation between observed patient adherence and viral load. Among the several measures of adherence investigated, two specifically account for long periods of time without intake. One is derived from the third moment of the inter-dose interval distribution, while the second reflects internal drug exposure using pharmacokinetic parameters. The approach is applied to a clinical trial involving 35 patients who were followed over 12 months. Results demonstrate a significant relation between patient adherence and virologic response."
7470,0.001,1.0000,"Transmitted HIV resistance is of both clinical and public health importance. Baseline genotypic resistance testing was performed for HIV-1-infected treatment-naive patients who were newly diagnosed between 2003 and 2007 and attended the government HIV clinic in Hong Kong. International AIDS Society-USA mutation figures and the Stanford resistance interpretation algorithm were used to identify resistance mutations and drug susceptibility, respectively. The pattern and factors associated with resistance were examined. The presence of one or more IAS-USA resistance mutations was found in 26 (3.6%) of 731 patients over the 5-year study period. Overall, protease inhibitor (PI) resistance mutations were most common (16), followed by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (8) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (3). Resistance to drugs in one, two, and three classes was present in 25 (3.4%), 1 (0.1%), and 0, respectively. Seventy-eight (10.7%) had strains of reduced susceptibility, as predicted by the Stanford algorithm to display at least low-level resistance to one or more drugs of the three classes. Intermediate or high-level resistance was found in 1.6% overall, and in descending order for NRTIs, PIs, and NNRTIs. There was no temporal trend of increase in resistance. Sex between men, Chinese ethnicity, and lower baseline CD4 were associated with harboring resistant strains as elucidated by either method. We conclude that transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance is uncommon in up to two decades of antiretroviral therapy in Hong Kong. The situation has to be continually monitored for any change in significance."

HBV DNA and HBV genotypic resistance test were performed. Patients were categorized into two groups: with and without HBV-DR. There were 84 patients with a mean age (standard deviation [SD]) of 42.2 (10.2) years and 77% were males. Median (range) duration of ART and lamivudine use was 46 (3-177) and 40 (3-140) months, respectively. Median (range) CD4 cell count was 352 (49-790) cells/mm(3). Of all, 19 (23%) had HBV-DR with a median (range) HBV DNA of 2.56 x 10(7) (2.54 x 10(3)-11 x 10(7)) IU/mL. In univariate analysis, there were no differences in age, gender, ART regimen, liver function test, anti-HBc antibody, anti-HCV antibody between the two groups. Patients with HBV-DR had a higher proportion of positive HBeAg (68.4% versus 3.8%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, positive HBeAg (odds ratio [OR) 16.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.31-83.60] and duration of lamivudine use [per 6-month increment, OR 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.36] were significant risk factors for HBV-DR. All 19 patients with HBV-DR had lamivudine resistance with the mutations as follows: M204V/I (95%), L180M/A181T (95%), L80V/I (47%), V173L (32%), and N236T (21%). Of these, 95%, 84%, 84%, and 0% of patients had HBV-DR to telbivudine, entecavir, adefovir, and tenofovir, respectively. HBV-DR is common in HBV/HIV-1 coinfected patients receiving lamivudine-containing ART without tenofovir. Positive HBeAg and longer duration of lamivudine use are risk factors for HBV-DR. In addition to lamivudine resistance, cross-resistance to other anti-HBV drugs is also frequently observed."

A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of primary drug resistance (PDR) in a cohort of young (<25 yrs) HAART-naïve HIV pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe. Whole blood was collected in EDTA for CD4 counts, viral load, serological estimation of duration of infection using the BED Calypte assay and genotyping for drug resistance. Four hundred and seventy-one women, mean age 21 years; SD: 2.1 were enrolled into the study between 2006 and 2007. Their median CD4 count was 371cells/µL; IQR: 255-511 cells/µL. Two hundred and thirty-six samples were genotyped for drug resistance. Based on the BED assay, 27% were recently infected (RI) whilst 73% had long-term infection (LTI). Median CD4 count was higher (p<0.05) in RI than in women with LTI. Only 2 women had drug resistance mutations; protease I85V and reverse transcriptase Y181C. Prevalence of PDR in Chitungwiza, 4 years after commencement of the national ART program remained below WHO threshold limit (5%). Frequency of recent infection BED testing is consistent with high HIV acquisition during pregnancy. With the scale-up of long-term ART programs, maintenance of proper prescribing practices, continuous monitoring of patients and reinforcement of adherence may prevent the acquisition and transmission of PDR."
8000,0.001,1.0000,"Drug interactions between rifamycins and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have raised concerns in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with tuberculosis. We conducted a study of this interaction by measuring serum drug levels of all HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis who were admitted to A. G. Holley State Tuberculosis Hospital (Florida) from October 1997 through December 1998, who were concomitantly treated with rifabutin and HAART. All 25 patients studied became culture-negative within 2 months of initiation of therapy for tuberculosis and remained negative for a median of 13 months follow-up after completion of therapy. HIV viral loads (mean+/-SEM) decreased significantly from 4.95+/-0.21 log10 copies/mL before initiation of HAART to 2.77+/-0.07 log10 copies/mL before discharge (P<.001); 20 of 25 patients achieved viral loads of <500copies/mL. In summary, the concomitant use of rifabutin and HAART can lead to successful treatment of HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis without increased side effects."
6621,0.001,1.0000,"Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) are nucleotide analogs that inhibit the replication of wild-type hepatitis B virus (HBV) and lamivudine (3TC)-resistant virus in HBV-infected patients, including those who are coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus. The combination of ADV or TDF with other nucleoside analogs is a proposed strategy for managing antiviral drug resistance during the treatment of chronic HBV infection. The antiviral effect of oral ADV or TDF, alone or in combination with 3TC or emtricitabine (FTC), against chronic woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection was evaluated in a placebo-controlled study in the woodchuck, an established and predictive model for antiviral therapy. Once-daily treatment for 48 weeks with ADV plus 3TC or TDF plus FTC significantly reduced serum WHV viremia levels from the pretreatment level by 6.2 log(10) and 6.1 log(10) genome equivalents/ml serum, respectively, followed by TDF plus 3TC (5.6 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), ADV alone (4.8 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), ADV plus FTC (one survivor) (4.4 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), TDF alone (2.9 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), 3TC alone (2.7 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), and FTC alone (2.0 log(10) genome equivalents/ml). Individual woodchucks across all treatment groups also demonstrated pronounced declines in serum WHV surface antigen, characteristically accompanied by declines in hepatic WHV replication and the hepatic expression of WHV antigens. Most woodchucks had prompt recrudescence of WHV replication after drug withdrawal, but individual woodchucks across treatment groups had sustained effects. No signs of toxicity were observed for any of the drugs or drug combinations administered. In conclusion, the oral administration of 3TC, FTC, ADV, and TDF alone and in combination was safe and effective in the woodchuck model of HBV infection."
5888,0.001,1.0000,"Treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) is rarely received by injection drug users (IDU), particularly those co-infected with HIV. We propose a framework for understanding factors that affect utilization and adherence to HCV therapy among HCV mono-infected and HIV/HCV-co-infected IDU. Provision of treatment requires calculation of risks and benefits including evaluation of a number of time-varying factors that collectively determine a gradient of treatment eligibility, advisability and acceptability, the relative importance of which may differ in co-infected and mono-infected IDU. Treatment eligibility is determined by a number of non-modifiable and modifiable contraindications, the latter of which can change over time rendering patients who were once ineligible eligible. Among those eligible, treatment need can be assessed by liver biopsy and therapy may be deferred in those with no liver disease and started in those with significant liver disease. Among those with moderate disease, further consideration of treatment advisability (medical factors that affect treatment response) and acceptability (individual, provider and environmental barriers) is needed before treatment decisions are made. These factors are dynamic and thus should be continually evaluated even among those who may not initially appear to be ready for treatment. An evaluation of this framework is needed to determine applicability and feasibility. Until then, treatment decisions should be made on an individual basis after careful consideration of these issues by provider and patient and efforts to develop novel strategies for identifying IDU who need treatment most (alternatives to liver biopsy) and multidimensional approaches to deliver treatment for HCV while addressing other factors including HIV infection, depression and drug use should be continued."
6999,0.001,1.0000,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) primarily involves a subgroup of T-lymphocytic cells, but other cell types are also invaded by the virus, including cell lines within the haematopoietic system. Together with infectious, inflammatory and neoplasic processes, invasion of haematopoietic tissue explains the haematological alterations which are seen during the course of infection with HIV-1. Anaemia develops in the large proportion of patients. Thrombocytopenia frequently occurs during the course of the disease, but may be seen in some patients already at the time of diagnosis, where the condition may be misdiagnosed as ""idiopathic"" thrombocytopenic purpura. Neutropenia is seen in all disease stages, but is most severe in patients with advanced disease. Bone marrow changes include varying degrees of dysplasia in one or more cell lines, which in some patients may mimic a myelodysplastic syndrome. The number of plasma cells is always increased. In many patients the bone marrow stroma exhibits an increased amount of reticular fibres. HIV-1 infection is associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin malignant lymphoma. Acute myelogenous leukaemia and myelomatosis have been described in patients with advanced disease. Treatment of the above mentioned haematological abnormalities aims primarily at reducing replication of HIV-1, thereby diminishing suppression of haematopoiesis by the virus infection, and at controlling the opportunistic infections during the course of the disease. Specific antiviral therapy (AZT) is most successful in correcting thrombocytopenia. The possibility of bone marrow suppression mediated by a toxic drug effect should always be considered in this patient group."
6505,0.001,1.0000,"Injection drug use (IDU) and HIV infection are important public health problems in Vietnam. The IDU population increased 70% from 2000 to 2004 and is disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS -- the country's second leading cause of death. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) share transmission routes with HIV and cause serious medical consequences. This study aimed to determine risk factors for acquisition of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections among IDUs in a northern province. We conducted a matched case-control study among active IDUs aged 18-45 who participated in a community-based survey (30-minute interview and serologic testing). Each HIV-infected IDU (case) was matched with one HIV-uninfected IDU (control) by age, sex (males only), and study site (128 pairs). Similar procedures were used for HBV infection (50 pairs) and HCV infection (65 pairs). Conditional logistic regression models were fit to identify risk factors for each infection. Among 309 surveyed IDUs, the HIV, HBV, and HCV prevalence was 42.4%, 80.9%, and 74.1%, respectively. Only 11.0% reported having been vaccinated against hepatitis B. While 13.3% of the IDUs reported sharing needles (past six months), 63.8% engaged in indirect sharing practices (past six months), including sharing drug solutions, containers, rinse water, and frontloading drugs. In multivariable models, sharing drugs through frontloading was significantly associated with HIV infection (odds ratio [OR]=2.8), HBV infection (OR=3.8), and HCV infection (OR=4.6). We report an unrecognized association between sharing drugs through frontloading and higher rates of HIV, HBV and HCV infections among male IDUs in Vietnam. This finding may have important implications for bloodborne viral prevention for IDUs in Vietnam."
3787,0.001,1.0000,"In chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients, T helper 17 (Th17) cells are significantly elevated. Th17 cells initiate immune‑mediated pathogenesis and have a critical role in the process of HBV‑related liver cirrhosis (HBV‑LC). The mechanisms underlying this process are attributed to Th17‑secreted cytokines, which include interleukin (IL)‑17, IL‑21 and IL‑22; however, a systemic analysis regarding these mechanisms has yet to be conducted. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of HBV‑LC. All randomized clinical trials, case series, case reports and meta‑analyses that contained the aforementioned keywords were included in the review process. In addition, unpublished information from the Food and Drug Administration was included. The findings indicated that Th17‑secreted cytokines, including IL‑17, IL‑21 and IL‑22, function by activating or silencing hepatic stellate cells, modulating proinflammatory and pro‑ or antifibrogenic effectors, regulating extracellular matrix formation, upregulating chemokine expression, and inducing hepatocellular damage or hepatoprotection during the HBV‑LC process. In addition, Th17 cells and Th17‑secreted cytokines may be considered a potential tool in the diagnosis or treatment of HBV‑LC. The present review summarized the role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of HBV‑LC in order to deepen the clinical understanding of the role of Th17 cells and also to support the development of effective therapies for patients with HBV‑LC."
6094,0.001,1.0000,"Pneumocystis carinii is a ubiquitous, atypical unicellular fungus. P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, and is the leading complication in advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Many different host (mammal)-specific species of Pneumocystis exist, but the life-cycle is not understood fully. Human strains are designated as P. carinii f. sp. (special form) hominis (at least 59 different types). P. carinii is spread via the airborne route. Disease is most frequently caused by fresh exposure to a source of P. carinii, rather than by reactivation of latent infection. Asymptomatic carriage among healthy persons may occur. PCP occurs in HIV-infected patients when the CD4+ count falls below a certain threshold; organisms multiply and gradually fill the alveoli. Symptoms, which include a mildly productive cough, progressive dyspnoea and fever, may persist for months prior to diagnosis. Without treatment, progressive respiratory insufficiency invariably ends in death. Pulmonary specimens may be obtained by procedures of varying sensitivity and risk. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by detection of stained organisms; however, staining procedures vary in sensitivity and ease of use. Robust polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols with good predictive results may be useful in the future. Therapy falls into two categories: for acute primary infections and for prophylaxis. A confirmed diagnosis ensures that patients do not receive potentially toxic medication (adverse drug reactions can occur). Prophylaxis can dramatically reduce the frequency of PCP in HIV patients, and its more widespread use should lead to a decline in the incidence of PCP in the future."
7369,0.001,1.0000,"Little is known about the factors that govern the level of HIV-1 replication in infected individuals. Recent studies (using potent antiviral drugs) of the kinetics of HIV-1 replication in vivo have demonstrated that steady-state levels of viremia are sustained by continuous rounds of de novo infection and the associated rapid turnover of CD4+ T lymphocytes. However, no information is available concerning the biologic variables that determine the size of the pool of T cells that are susceptible to virus infection or the amount of virus produced from infected cells. Furthermore, it is not known whether all CD4+ T lymphocytes are equally susceptible to HIV-1 infection at a given time or whether the infection is focused on cells of a particular state of activation or antigenic specificity. Although HIV-1 replication in culture is known to be greatly facilitated by T cell activation, the ability of specific antigenic stimulation to augment HIV-1 replication in vivo has not been studied. We sought to determine whether vaccination of HIV-1-infected adults leads to activation of virus replication and the targeting of vaccine antigen-responsive T cells for virus infection and destruction. Should T cell activation resulting from exposure to environmental antigens prove to be an important determinant of the steady-state levels of HIV-1 replication in vivo and lead to the preferential loss of specific populations of CD4+ T lymphocytes, it would have significant implications for our understanding of and therapeutic strategies for HIV-1 disease. To begin to address these issues, HIV-1-infected individuals and uninfected controls were studied by measurement of immune responses to influenza antigens and quantitation of virion-associated plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at baseline and at intervals after immunization with the trivalent influenza vaccine. Influenza vaccination resulted in readily demonstrable but transient increases in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, indicative of activation of viral replication, in HIV-1-infected individuals with preserved ability to immunologically respond to vaccine antigens. Activation of HIV-1 replication by vaccination was more often seen and of greater magnitude in individuals who displayed a T cell proliferative response to vaccine antigens at baseline and in those who mounted a significant serologic response after vaccination. The fold increase in viremia, as well as the rates of increase of HIV-1 in plasma after vaccination and rates of viral decline after peak viremia, were higher in individuals with higher CD4+ T cell counts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
4399,0.001,1.0000,"The availability of HIV-1 genotype resistance testing (GRT) to clinicians has been insufficiently studied outside randomized clinical trials. The present study evaluated the outcome of salvage antiretroviral therapy (ART) recommended by an expert physician based on GRT in a non-clinical trial setting in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil. A prospective, open, nonrandomized study evaluating easy access to GRT at six Brazilian AIDS Clinics was carried out. This cooperative study analyzed the efficacy of treatment recommended to patients whose salvage ART was guided by GRT with that of treatment with ART based only on previous ART history. A total of 112 patients with ART failure were included in the study, and 77 of them were submitted to GRT. The median CD4 cell count and viral load for these 77 patients at baseline were (mean +/- SD) 252.1 +/- 157.4 cells/microL and 4.60 +/- 0.5 log10 HIV RNA copies/mL, respectively. The access time, i.e., the time elapsed between ordering the GRT and receiving the result was, on average, 71.9 +/- 37.3 days. The study results demonstrated that access to GRT followed by expert recommendations did not improve the time to persistent treatment failure when compared to conventional salvage ART. Access to GRT in this Brazilian community health care setting did not improve the long-term virologic outcomes of HIV-infected patients experiencing treatment failure. This result is probably related to the long time required to implement ART guided by GRT."
5594,0.001,1.0000,"Possible pathophysiological, clinical and epidemiological interactions between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tropical pathogens, especially malaria parasites, constitute a concern in tropical areas. Two decades of research have shown that HIV-related immunosuppression is correlated with increased malaria infection, burden, and treatment failure, and with complicated malaria, irrespective of immune status. The recent role out of antiretroviral therapies and new antimalarials, such as artemisinin combination therapies, raise additional concerns regarding possible synergistic and antagonistic effects on efficacy and toxicity. Co-trimoxazole, which is used to prevent opportunistic infections, has been shown to have strong antimalarial prophylactic properties, despite its long-term use and increasing antifolate resistance. The administration of efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, with amodiaquine-artesunate has been associated with increased toxicity. Recent in vivo observations have confirmed that protease inhibitors have strong antimalarial properties. Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and artemether-lumefantrine have a synergistic effect in terms of improved malaria treatment outcomes, with no apparent increase in the risk of toxicity. Overall, for the prevention and treatment of malaria in HIV-infected populations, the current standard of care is similar to that in non-HIV-infected populations. The available data show that the wider use of insecticide-treated bed-nets, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy might substantially reduce the morbidity of malaria in HIV-infected patients. These observations show that those accessing care for HIV infection are now, paradoxically, well protected from malaria. These findings therefore highlight the need for confirmatory diagnosis of malaria in HIV-infected individuals receiving these interventions, and the provision of different artemisinin-based combination therapies to treat malaria only when the diagnosis is confirmed."
4423,0.001,1.0000,"These recommendations were developed by the U.S. Public Health Service to address the increasing epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among women and their infants. The recommendations stress the importance of early diagnosis of HIV infection for the health of both women and their infants and are based on advances made in HIV-related treatment and prevention. The most significant advance for this population has been the results from a placebo-controlled, clinical trial that indicated that administration of zidovudine to HIV-infected pregnant women and their newborns reduced the risk for perinatal transmission of HIV by approximately two thirds (1). This document recommends routine HIV counseling and voluntary testing for all pregnant women and is intended to serve as guidance for health-care providers in educating women about the importance of knowing their HIV infection status. For uninfected women, such HIV counseling and testing programs can provide information that can reduce their risk for acquiring HIV; for women who have HIV infection, these programs can enable them to receive appropriate and timely medical interventions for their own health and for reducing the risk for perinatal (i.e., mother to infant) and other modes of HIV transmission. These programs also can facilitate appropriate follow-up care and services for HIV-infected women, their infants, and other family members."
3436,0.001,1.0000,"The drug resistance profile of treatment-naive HIV-infected individuals living in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was studied. Samples taken from 94 drug-naive individuals with established HIV infection and 13 patients with primary HIV infection were assessed by nucleotide sequencing and LIPA. The prevalence of drug-associated primary mutations in individuals with established infection was very low. In the viral protease region, 1/86 (1.2%) individuals carried the D30N mutation, whereas 1/85 (1.2%) had the M41L mutation in the reverse transcriptase (RT) region. Secondary mutations in both the protease and RT regions were found in almost 90% of the individuals. In individuals with primary infection, primary mutations were detected in 2/13 (15.4%) patients, one of them carrying M461 mutation in the protease while the other patient had a mutation at codon 184 of the RT. In accordance with current drug resistance testing guidelines, the results of this study suggest that susceptibility tests need not be performed at this time prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected people in Argentina. However, the public health implications of this subject warrant follow-up studies that will examine a larger number of drug-naive patients, not only in Buenos Aires but also in other major Argentinian cities and in rural areas."
7105,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been a tremendous health burden worldwide with an annual mortality of 300,000 people due to decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. A combination of interferon (IFN), ribavirin (RBV), and/or direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) can eradicate HCV in a various proportion of infected patients. Unfortunately, IFN-based therapy is associated with significant adverse effects, contraindications, and limited tolerability, leading to lower adherence or even treatment discontinuation. With the rapid evolution of newer DAAs or host-targeting agents, emerging HCV therapy is moving towards an IFN- and RBV-free strategy. To this end, a recently developed NS3 protease inhibitor, asunaprevir (ASV), in combination with other DAAs as IFN/RBV-containing or -free regimen, has shown promising results with fewer adverse effects. In this review, preclinical profiles and clinical proof-of-concept studies of ASV, including viral resistance, host polymorphism, and role of ASV in future HCV therapy are reviewed and discussed. "

2407,0.001,1.0000,"The clinical significance of persistent residual viremia in patients on prolonged highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is not clear. Moreover, it remains to be demonstrated whether residual viremia consists of viruses capable of spreading infection in vivo upon termination of therapy. Using residual viral RNAs (vRNAs) isolated from a HAART-treated patient's plasma, we cloned full-length viral genomes and found that most of them could produce infectious, replication-competent HIVs when transfected into TZM-bl cells, suggesting that residual viruses produced in the absence of therapy can initiate fresh cycles of infection and spread in host cells. The data further indicate that residual viremia may pose a major concern with regard to the emergence of drug-resistant HIVs during periods of low adherence to therapy."
4372,0.001,1.0000,"The routes of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus transmission are quite similar and coexistence of both viruses in one patient is not a rare phenomenon. Until now, the natural course of liver diseases induced by coinfections has not been well documented and the mechanisms of interaction between the two viruses and the human host have not been fully clarified. We report the case of a patient suffering from chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus who developed an acute hepatitis B virus superinfection. Serum hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid became undetectable by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction at diagnosis of acute hepatitis B virus infection. At the same time, there was a striking increase in the serum concentrations of the antibodies against C22 and C33c hepatitis C virus antigens. Four months after clinical resolution of the acute hepatitis, hepatitis B surface antigen was undetectable in serum and three months later antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen appeared. Two years after acute hepatitis B virus infection, the patient has had no relapse of markers for viral replication of hepatitis B virus. Transaminases are within the reference range and hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid is undetectable in both serum and liver tissue. We hypothesize that acute hepatitis B virus infection stimulated a specific humoral response against hepatitis C virus as well as triggering non-specific defense mechanisms which finally eliminated both viruses."
5712,0.001,1.0000,"Acute HIV-1 infection is often diagnosed as infectious mononucleosis and the symptoms resolve spontaneously after varying periods of time. After the infection of HIV-1 through the mucosa, the characteristic clinical symptoms and laboratory markers of acute HIV-1 infection appear in each patient through a complicated virus-host interaction. To understand the host responses, we measured two unique proinflammatory cytokines, galectin-9 (Gal-9) and osteopontin (OPN). A β-galactoside-binding mammalian lectin, Gal-9, reduces pro-inflammatory type-1 helper T (Th1) cells and Th17 cells and increases anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells. The plasma level of Gal-9 is known to be associated with HIV-1 viral load in chronic HIV-1 infection. On the contrary, osteopontin induces Th1/Th17 cells and promotes tissue inflammation. OPN is synthesized by variety of cells in the body, and dendritic cells are known to synthesize OPN in HIV-1 infected individuals. It was hypothesized that Gal-9 and/or OPN could be not only immune-modulators but also novel biomarkers of acute HIV-1 infection. We experienced 3 patients with acute HIV-1 and measured the levels of Gal-9 and OPN periodically before and after antiretroviral treatment. The results showed that the plasma levels of Gal-9 were extremely elevated [more than 2,300 pg/ml (normal range < 46 pg/ml)] in all three acute HIV-1 infected individuals and decreased rapidly after treatment. The changes in the OPN levels were less marked. In conclusion, the plasma levels of Gal-9 may be predictive of a severe inflammation status during the acute phase of HIV-1 infection and could be a potential biomarker during acute infection."

The duration of antiretroviral treatment (bi- or tri-therapy) before the detection of insertions ranged from 12 to 60 months. Dipeptide insertions were detected in ten patients, of which the most frequent was serine-serine. A monopeptide insertion was diagnosed once. The amino-acid composition patterns of insertions varied with time in five of the 11 patients. Peptide insertions were always associated with various patterns of pre-existing or appearing resistance mutations in the RT pol gene to different antiretroviral drugs. Genotypic-guided treatment resulted in virological and immunological improvement in two patients. In contrast, the remaining patients did not respond to any of the various antiretroviral regimens prescribed. Furthermore, various patterns of resistance mutations developed to the prescribed antiretroviral drugs, with AIDS-related conditions leading to death in two patients. It was concluded that peptide insertion in this region of the HIV-1 RT pol gene constitutes a rare cause of persistent therapeutic failure, and that management of such patients remains challenging despite successive genotypic analyses aimed at detecting mutations conferring antiretroviral drug resistance."
3291,0.001,1.0000,"Following the release of the 2010 National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued core clinical indicators for measuring health outcomes in HIV-positive persons. As early retention in HIV primary care is associated with improved long-term health outcomes, we employed IOM indicators as a guide to examine a cohort of persons initiating HIV outpatient medical care at a university-affiliated HIV clinic in the Southern United States (January 2007-July 2012). Using indicators for visit attendance, CD4 and viral load laboratory testing frequency, and antiretroviral therapy initiation, we evaluated factors associated with achieving IOM core indicators among care- and treatment-naïve patients during the first year of HIV care. Of 448 patients (mean age = 35 years, 35.7% white, 79.0% male, 58.4% education beyond high school, 35.9% monthly income > $1,000 US, 47.3% uninsured), 84.6% achieved at least four of five IOM indicators. In multivariable analyses, persons with monthly income > $1,000 (ORadj. = 3.71; 95% CI: 1.68-8.19; p = 0.001) and depressive symptoms (ORadj. = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.02-4.45; p = 0.04) were significantly more likely to achieve at least four of the five core indicators, while patients with anxiety symptoms were significantly less likely to achieve these indicators (ORadj. = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.26-0.97; p = 0.04). Age, sex, race, education, insurance status, transportation barriers, alcohol use, and HIV status disclosure to family were not associated with achieving core indicators. Evaluating and addressing financial barriers and anxiety symptoms during the first year of HIV outpatient care may improve individual health outcomes and subsequent achievement of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.

4463,0.001,1.0000,"Previous studies have reported that approximately 10% of the patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection develop HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). However, over the last decade, morbidity and mortality as a result of HIV-1 infection has remarkably decreased with the availability of potent new antiretroviral drugs. We therefore determined the prevalence of HIVAN from autopsy data of HIV-infected patients in more recent years (1992 to 1997). Autopsy reports of 389 patients were reviewed. In reports suggestive of possible HIVAN, slides of renal tissue were retrieved and reviewed again to ensure appropriate classification. The criteria for the diagnosis of HIVAN were focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with collapse of the glomerular tuft in some glomeruli, extensive tubular ectasia, and significant tubulointerstitial disease. Of 389 autopsy reports, 54% of the patients were black, 35% were white, and 11% were Hispanic. Thirty-three percent of the patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse. The mean CD4 count of the patients was 54 +/- 91/microL (mean +/- SD). In 27 cases, typical features of HIVAN were found based on the criteria used, accounting for an overall HIVAN prevalence of 6.9% (27 of 389 autopsies). Because the overwhelming majority of these patients were black (93%), the prevalence in blacks was 12% (25 of 209 autopsies). We conclude that although mortality and morbidity from HIV infection is decreasing, HIVAN remains an important complication of HIV infection in blacks, even in recent years."
6947,0.001,1.0000,"The importance of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in the progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a subject of debate. This study sought to identify independent risk factors involved in development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly in patients with chronic HBV infection who have normal ALT values. Data from 381 consecutive hepatitis B patients were analyzed with average ALT integration values < or = 40 IU/L and follow-up periods of > 3 years. Integration values were calculated from biochemical tests, and serological markers associated with the cumulative incidence of HCC were analyzed. HCC developed in 17 of the 381 patients (4.5%) during the follow-up period. Male sex (hazard ratio, 6.011 [95% confidence interval: 1.353-26.710], P = 0.018), high HBV-DNA levels (> or = 5.0 log copies/ml; 5.125 [1.880-13.973], P = 0.001), low platelet counts (< 15.0 x 10(4)/mm(3); 4.803 [1.690-13.647], P = 0.003), and low total cholesterol levels (< 130 mg/dl; 5.983 [1.558-22.979], P = 0.009) were significantly associated with greater incidence of HCC development. High HBV-DNA levels and low platelet counts are associated with the development of HCC in patients infected with hepatitis B who have normal ALT values. Therefore, maintenance of low HBV-DNA levels is important for the prevention of HCC in patients with low platelet counts, particularly in patients whose ALT values fall within the current normal range."

For Kaposi's sarcoma these rates were 23.2, 11.3, and 15.1, respectively. The incidence of some opportunistic infections, including Mycobacterium avium complex, nonretinitis cytomegalovirus disease, and cytomegalovirus retinitis, increased among persons receiving P. carinii pneumonia prophylaxis, because of reduction of this pneumonia and extension of life span. The incidence pattern of AIDS-defining illnesses in patients receiving treatment points to the changing AIDS epidemic and the need for new therapies. The data are particularly relevant to the development and planning of clinical trials and to health care providers."
6917,0.001,1.0000,"In a recent randomized controlled trial, the use of protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) was associated with a significantly lower incidence of malaria compared with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus-infected Ugandan children living in an area of high malaria transmission intensity. In this report, we compared the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia and gametocytemia using data from the same cohort. The prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia did not differ between the two ART treatment arms. The PI-based arm was associated with a lower risk of gametocytemia at the time of diagnosis of malaria (6.6% versus 14.5%, P = 0.03) and during the 28 days after malaria diagnosis (3.4% versus 6.5%, P = 0.04). Thus, in addition to decreasing the incidence of malaria, the use of PI-based ART may lower transmission, as a result of a decrease in gametocytemia, in areas of high malaria transmission intensity."
4856,0.001,1.0000,"In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-1 infection frequently occurs in the context of other coinfecting pathogens, most importantly, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and malaria parasites. The consequences are often devastating, resulting in enhanced morbidity and mortality. Due to the large number of confounding factors influencing pathogenesis in coinfected people, we sought to develop a nonhuman primate model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-malaria coinfection. In sub-Saharan Africa, Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria parasite and is responsible for most malaria-induced deaths. The simian malaria parasite Plasmodium fragile can induce clinical symptoms, including cerebral malaria in rhesus macaques, that resemble those of P. falciparum infection in humans. Thus, based on the well-characterized rhesus macaque model of SIV infection, this study reports the development of a novel rhesus macaque SIV-P. fragile coinfection model to study human HIV-P. falciparum coinfection. Using this model, we show that coinfection is associated with an increased, although transient, risk of both HIV and malaria transmission. Specifically, SIV-P. fragile coinfected macaques experienced an increase in SIV viremia that was temporarily associated with an increase in potential SIV target cells and systemic immune activation during acute parasitemia. Conversely, primary parasitemia in SIV-P. fragile coinfected animals resulted in higher gametocytemia that subsequently translated into higher oocyst development in mosquitoes. To our knowledge, this is the first animal model able to recapitulate the increased transmission risk of both HIV and malaria in coinfected humans. Therefore, this model could serve as an essential tool to elucidate distinct immunological, virological, and/or parasitological parameters underlying disease exacerbation in HIV-malaria coinfected people."
1200,0.001,1.0000,"Since the first case of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was reported in 1981, AIDS, as the global disease affecting 33.2 million people in 2007, has always been an unsolved problem worldwide. Reverse transcriptase (RT) is a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and thereby has been the prime drugs target for antiretroviral (ARV) therapy against AIDS. To date, two classes of RT inhibitors (RTIs), e.g., nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and a lot of compounds tested as RTIs have been described. To our knowledge, bis(heteroaryl)piperazines (BHAPs) have been considered as one class of promising NNRTIs, such as structurally and chemically related NNRTI delavirdine, which was approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in 1997. In this mini-review, we make attempts to report the progress of synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of BHAPs, in the meantime, the synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 replication by combining delavirdine with other HIV-1 inhibitors is also discussed. It will pave the way for the design and development of BHAPs as anti-HIV-1 agents in AIDS chemotherapy in the future."
4109,0.001,1.0000,"Liver disease is currently the second leading cause of death in HIV-infected persons in Western countries. Hepatitis C virus infection accounts for the majority of cases of hepatic illness in this population. Although great progress has been made in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-positive patients, many challenges still remain unsolved. The combination of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin is the current treatment of choice in hepatitis C virus/HIV-coinfected patients, regardless of hepatitis C virus genotype. However, the limited efficacy of this therapy in the HIV setting makes necessary the development of new strategies and/or drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C infection. Several anti-hepatitis C virus compounds are currently under investigation, although most are still in the early stages of clinical development. There is a relatively large group of patients who will be unable to be treated with the current hepatitis C virus medication based on interferon, mainly due to contraindications such as serious neuropsychiatric or cardiovascular history. However, for those without contraindications, treatment should be provided with no restrictions at the start (e.g. asking unnecessarily for a liver biopsy), and reassessed at weeks 4 and 12, considering virologic responses. Treatment should only be continued in early virologic responders. The use of standard doses of ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day) and for at least 12 months seems crucial to maximize the effect of current hepatitis C treatment in the HIV setting, while no further benefit seems to derive from using higher than recommended pegylated interferon dosages. In patients with rapid virologic response (undetectable viremia at week 4) to anti-hepatitis C therapy, shorter periods of therapy (24 weeks) may be advisable in hepatitis C genotypes 2 and 3. Finally, adequate selection of candidates and careful selection of concomitant antiretroviral medications must be encouraged. Patients with low CD4 percentages (< 15%) should be deferred for treatment and HAART prioritized in order to improve CD4 counts. When possible, nucleoside analogs such as zidovudine, stavudine, and abacavir should be replaced by others having no deleterious interactions with ribavirin (e.g. tenofovir, lamivudine, or emtricitabine). Didanosine should never be coadministered with ribavirin due to potential life-threatening complications."

We used metabolomics to determine whether a sex difference in plasma amino acids, acylcarnitines, and organic acids predictive of diabetes and impaired energy metabolism is present in HIV-infected persons on long-term ART.We enrolled 70 HIV-infected adults (43% women) on efavirenz, tenofovir, and emtricitabine (Atripla) with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for over 2 years. Half of the HIV-infected subjects were obese, and these were matched with 30 obese HIV-negative controls. All subjects had no history of diabetes, statin use, or heavy alcohol use. Fasting insulin sensitivity was measured using homeostatic model assessment 2 (HOMA2), and adipose tissue was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to quantitate fasting plasma branched chain and aromatic amino acids predictive of incident diabetes, and C3 and C5 acylcarnitinines and organic acids indicative of impaired energy metabolism.HIV-infected women had more baseline risk factors for insulin resistance: women were older (46 vs 44 years) and had a longer ART duration (8.4 vs 5.1 years, P < 0.05 for both) compared with men but had similar CD4+ count (median 701 cells/μL), smoking and hepatic C prevalence, and body mass index (BMI) (median 30.3 kg/m). However, women had higher insulin sensitivity compared with men (P < 0.01), and lower plasma levels of isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine (P < 0.01 for all), and lower C3 and C5 acylcarnitines (P < 0.01 for all), in multivariable regression models after adjusting for DEXA fat mass index, age, race, CD4+ count, smoking, and ART duration. In the obese HIV-infected subjects and HIV-negative controls, the relationship of sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status.HIV-infected women on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART had superior glucose tolerance and lower plasma metabolites associated with the development of diabetes compared with men with similar metabolic disease risk profiles. The relationship between sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status among obese subjects, suggesting the observed sex-differences may not be specific to HIV infection.

Patients received 9 MU/3x/weekly/3 months of recombinant IFN alpha A. Mean NK activity of the HBV-DNA patients rose significantly from 29.9 +/- 5.3 to 45 +/- 4.7 during therapy, whereas the 6/16 HDV-RNA positive patients did not show any significant increase of NK activity. Interestingly, individual HDV-RNA positive patients exhibiting boosted NK activity also showed improvement of disease confirmed by clearance of intrahepatic delta antigen at one year. No such a correlation was found amongst the HBV-DNA positive patients. These data indicate that in spite of widespread individual variability, IFN-mediated NK boost may herald delta clearance and help in identifying ""responders"" and ""non-responders"" in IFN trials."

In order to examine the relationship of HIV infection to drug-resistant tuberculosis in other selected regions of the United States, we established a registry of cases of culture-proven tuberculosis. Data were collected from sites participating in an NIH-funded, community-based HIV clinical trials group. All cases of tuberculosis, regardless of HIV status, which occurred between January 1992 and June 1994 were recorded. Overall, 1,373 cases of tuberculosis were evaluated, including 425 from the New York City area, and 948 from seven other metropolitan areas. The overall prevalence of resistance to one or more drugs was 20.4%, and 5.6% of isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (MDR). In the New York City area, HIV-infected patients were significantly more likely than persons not known to be HIV-infected, to have resistance to at least one drug (37% versus 19%) and MDR (19% versus 6%). In other geographic areas, overall drug resistance was 16%, and only 2.2% of isolates were MDR. In multiple logistic regression analyses, HIV infection was shown to be a risk factor for drug-resistant tuberculosis, independent of geographic location, history of prior therapy, age, and race. We concluded that HIV infection is associated with increased rates of resistance to antituberculosis drugs in both the New York City area and other geographic areas. MDR tuberculosis is occurring predominantly in the New York City area and is highly correlated with HIV infection."

There was continued emphasis on pathogenesis, management, and prevention of the long-term complications of HIV disease and its therapies, including cardiovascular disease, lipodystrophy, renal disease, and alterations in bone metabolism. Malignancies, particularly non-AIDS-defining cancers, have emerged as a leading complication and cause of death in HIV infection that may not be fully mitigated by immune reconstitution with antiretroviral therapy.

3174,0.001,1.0000,"The present study aimed to evaluate the molecular epidemiology of HBV in chronic HBV infected cases from northeast India (NEI), since scanty data are available from the region which has a predominant ethnically distinct tribal population. A total of 523 clinically diagnosed index chronic HBV infected cases and 172 asymptomatic patients (based on family screening) were enrolled with informed consent. Patients were stratified based on serology, imaging, pathology, and clinical data and grouped as chronic HBV and cirrhotic cohorts. Analysis for serum HBV DNA levels and HBV genotyping was performed, and was statistically co-related with disease severity. Males were more prone to chronic HBV infection. Majority of the patients who had Chronic HBV infection based on family screening were females (59.88%), majorly wives of index patients. Mean viral load in Chronic HBV patients was almost 4.5-folds higher than cirrhosis patients, and was significantly associated with e-antigen positive status(P < 0.001) in both groups. HBV genotype D was the most prevalent genotype (62.30%) in NEI. Mixed genotype infection of A + D was found from Assam, along with C + D cases (1.29%) cumulatively. There is a high prevalence of HBV genotype C (13.96%) in our studied cohort which was found to be associated with higher viral load(P = 0.018), e-antigen positivity(P = 0.043), and increased cirrhosis risk compared to Chronic HBV cases [OR = 1.670]. Family contacts in NEI are prone to infection with HBV and development of Chronic HBV. Higher presence of e-positive cases and genotype C along with the mixed genotypes in NEI is unique and of significance with reference to predisposition to disease severity and even response to antiviral therapy."
4135,0.001,1.0000,"Liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinomas are major health problems of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. To date, rare model has reproduced liver fibrosis associated with long-term HBV infection which in turn has hindered both the understanding of HBV biology and the development of new treatment options. Here, using adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) mediated delivery of a 1.2-kb HBV genome, we successfully generated a chronic HBV infectious mouse model that presents the associated liver fibrosis observed following human infection. After AAV8/HBV1.2 vector administration, mice demonstrated effective HBV replication and transcription which resulted in HBV antigen expression and viremia over 6 months. Although no obvious acute inflammatory response was noted, these mice still developed chronic liver disease and hepatic fibrogenesis as demonstrated by increased ground glass-like hepatocytes, an increasing trend of collagen deposition and upregulated fibrosis markers, including type I collagen, type III collagen, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP), and transforming growth factor-β1(TGF-β1). Taken together, AAV-mediated HBV gene delivery to the mouse liver, induced HBV persistent infection accompanied by liver fibrosis which can serve as a model for investigating the precise mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis following chronic HBV infection as well as for the potential development of novel therapeutics.

Data analysis indicated that 16S rRNA gene copy numbers for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of HBV cirrhotic patients. The Bifidobacteria/Enterobacteriaceae (B/E) ratio, which may indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 ± 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 ± 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 ± 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis B to 0.64 ± 0.09 in patients with decompensated HBV cirrhosis (for all, P < 0.01). This suggests that B/E ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. The data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. Fecal secretory IgA and tumor necrosis factor-α in decompensated HBV cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance."
7450,0.001,1.0000,"The remarkable advances in interferon-sparing, all-oral hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment were a highlight of the 2014 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). The backbone of the nucleotide inhibitor sofosbuvir and the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor ledipasvir with an additional third agent (HCV protease inhibitor or HCV nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) led to a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate 12 weeks after cessation of treatment of 95% to 100% after only 6 weeks of treatment. These results demonstrate the potential of combination directacting antiviral (DAA) therapy for abbreviated, well-tolerated, and highly effective HCV treatment. Two triple-drug regimens that comprised 12 weeks of an NS5A inhibitor, an HCV protease inhibitor, and a nonnucleoside inhibitor also resulted in SVRs of more than 90% in patients with HCV genotype 1. HIV coinfection does not appear to negatively impact response to DAA-based HCV therapy, as evidenced by similar response rates in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients receiving interferonsparing or -containing regimens. There was continued emphasis at CROI 2014 on non-AIDS complications of HIV infection, specifically cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, and bone and endocrine disorders that persist among patients with treated HIV disease and contribute to morbidity and mortality. Finally, new data on novel drugs and combinations for treatment of tuberculosis (TB), patient outcomes using new rapid TB diagnostics, and a short-course TB prevention strategy were presented. "
1950,0.001,1.0000,"The life expectancy of HIV-infected persons has extended significantly since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapies. Although classical opportunistic infections are now rarely seen, the toxicity of antiretroviral drugs as well as liver disease caused by hepatitis viruses represent an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality among HIV-positive persons. Since the rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is high among HIV carriers (up to 75% among intravenous drug users), HCV/HIV coinfection is widely prevalent. Predisposing liver damage favors a higher rate of hepatotoxicity of antiretroviral drugs, which can limit the benefit of HIV treatment in some individuals. Overall, severe hepatotoxicity appears in around 10% of subjects who began triple combinations including either protease inhibitors or non-nucleosides. The progression to cirrhosis seems to occur faster in the setting of HIV infection, and conversely recent data demonstrate that HCV infection can accelerate the progression to AIDS in HIV-positive persons. Although clinicians have been reluctant to treat hepatitis C in HIV-infected people, this therapeutic nihilism is unwarranted. The availability of new more successful regimens to treat hepatitis C, in particular using the new pegylated forms of interferon in combination with ribavirin, open new hopes for the care of HIV-HCV-coinfected persons."

This study aims at reporting our experience with percutaneous LBx in a cohort of haemophiliacs infected with HCV and describe the spectrum of disease and impact of HIV coinfection. A retrospective review of consecutive patients with haemophilia and HCV who underwent percutaneous LBx was performed. All patients were positive for HCV RNA by commercial assay and received factor concentrate prior to biopsy. A total of 29 male patients (mean age 36, 24 haemophilia A, five haemophilia B, and 44% coinfected with HIV) underwent successful outpatient percutaneous LBx without bleeding complication. Histologic activity index was 6.44 with advanced fibrosis (bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis) in 31%. When patients were stratified by HIV positive (n = 13) vs. HIV negative (n = 16), coinfected patients had higher fibrosis scores and higher proportion advanced fibrosis (54% vs. 12%; P = 0.0167) with no differences in age, demographic or other laboratory parameters. Multivariate logistic regression found that HIV positivity was independently associated with advanced fibrosis (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.17-11.8; P = 0.026). Outpatient percutaneous LBx can be safely performed in patients with haemophilia. Despite similar age, HIV coinfection was an independent predictor of advanced fibrosis. These data support the hypothesis that HIV accelerates fibrosis progression in those coinfected with HCV and highlights the importance of liver histology in this population."

All but two had used factor concentrate that had not undergone viral inactivation; two patients had used only cryoprecipitate. The overall prevalence of HCV antibody positivity was 76.3%. There was no significant difference in age or the amount of non-heat-treated factor concentrate used between the group that was HCV antibody positive and negative. There was also no significant difference between aminotransferase levels in the two groups. There was a positive association between HCV antibody and the presence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen and antibody to human immunodeficiency virus. A group of 31 patients were tested twice for HCV antibody at intervals of 35 to 71 months. In this subset, 25 were repeatedly seropositive, 4 were repeatedly seronegative, and 2 went from seropositive to seronegative. These data confirm the previous impression that non-A, non-B hepatitis is a major sequela to the use of pooled coagulation factor concentrates. HCV infection may account for most of the chronic liver disease observed in this population. Anti-HCV testing of plasma donors and improved methods of viral inactivation should prevent new cases from developing."

One of the isolated clones (termed Vpr-1) expressed only doubly spliced mRNA, but not unspliced or singly spliced mRNA. Western blots of Vpr-1 revealed the presence of the nef translation product, although no expression of major structural genes such as gag, pol, and env was detected by indirect immunofluorescence and assay of reverse transcriptase activity. These HIV-1 phenotypes differed greatly from those of the original M10/vpr-, most of which expressed major structural HIV-1 proteins. Despite undetectable levels of env expression in Vpr-1, CD4 antigens were greatly down-modulated on the surface without alteration of steady-state levels of CD4 mRNA expression, similar to M10/vpr-. These HIV-1 phenotypes in Vpr-1 did not change after the treatment of the cells with both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin. Therefore, the abnormal HIV-1 life cycle in Vpr-1 seems to be due to some viral factor(s), as well as cellular factors. Thus, Vpr-1 could be a useful model for understanding one HIV-1 latent form."
9754,0.001,1.0000,"CD4+ Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are potent immune modulators and serve an important function in human immune homeostasis. Depletion of Tregs has led to measurable increases in antigen-specific T cell responses in vaccine settings for cancer and infectious pathogens. However, their role in HIV-1 immuno-pathogenesis remains controversial, as they could either serve to suppress deleterious HIV-1-associated immune activation and thus slow HIV-1 disease progression or alternatively suppress HIV-1-specific immunity and thereby promote virus spread. Understanding and modulating Treg function in the context of HIV-1 could lead to potential new strategies for immunotherapy or HIV vaccines. However, important open questions remain on their role in the context of HIV-1 infection, which needs to be carefully studied. Representing roughly 5% of human CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood, studying the Treg population has proven to be difficult, especially in HIV-1 infected individuals where HIV-1-associated CD4 T cell and with that Treg depletion occurs. The characterization of regulatory T cells in individuals with advanced HIV-1 disease or tissue samples, for which only very small biological samples can be obtained, is therefore extremely challenging. We propose a technical solution to overcome these limitations using isolation and expansion of Tregs from HIV-1-positive individuals. Here we describe an easy and robust method to successfully expand Tregs isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals in vitro. Flow-sorted CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low) Tregs were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads and cultured in the presence of IL-2. The expanded Tregs expressed high levels of FOXP3, CTLA4 and HELIOS compared to conventional T cells and were shown to be highly suppressive. Easier access to large numbers of Tregs will allow researchers to address important questions concerning their role in HIV-1 immunopathogenesis. We believe answering these questions may provide useful insight for the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine."
9053,0.001,1.0000,"The impact of antiretroviral drug exposure and associated lipodystrophy and/or insulin resistance (IR) on advanced liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is not fully documented.

One hundred ninety patients (28.3%) had advanced liver fibrosis. In univariate analysis, advanced liver fibrosis was significantly associated with male sex, higher body mass index, HCV infection through intravenous drug use, a lower absolute CD4 cell count, a longer history of antiretroviral treatment, longer durations of protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and NRTI exposure, lipodystrophy, diabetes, and a high homeostasis model assessment method (HOMA) value. The only antiretroviral drugs associated with advanced liver fibrosis were efavirenz, stavudine and didanosine. In multivariate analysis, male sex (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.5; P = 0.018), HCV infection through intravenous drug use (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6; P = 0.018), lipodystrophy (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.3; P = 0.01), median didanosine exposure longer than 5 months (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.8; P = 0.04) and a high HOMA value (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2; P = 0.005) remained significantly associated with advanced liver fibrosis. Mitochondrial toxicity and IR thus appear to play a key role in liver damage associated with HIV/HCV-coinfection, and this should be taken into account when selecting and optimizing antiretroviral therapy. Antiretroviral drugs with strong mitochondrial toxicity (e.g. didanosine) or a major effect on glucose metabolism should be avoided."

A alpha-galactosidase-vpu fusion protein representing aa 37-68 of vpu was used to screen 356 human serum samples from HIV-1-infected persons for antibodies to the novel epitope. A total of 125 (35.1%) of the samples reacted with this region of vpu. Antibodies against this region were significantly more prevalent among samples from individuals with CD4 cell counts < 400 cells/microliters than individuals with CD4 cell counts > or = 400 cells/microliters (37.6 vs. 17.6%; p < 0.0146, Fisher's exact test). Thus, the presence of antibodies against this epitope of vpu appears to be associated with a progressed state of disease."
5652,0.001,1.0000,"LAV/HTLV-III has been closely linked to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We have studied and correlated the prevalence of AIDS-associated retrovirus and retroviral antibodies in several groups of male homosexuals from Greenwich Village. Retrovirus was detected in cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes by testing for reverse transcriptase (RT) and confirmed by establishment of virus-producer cell lines, and electron microscopy. Seventy-six percent of patients with AIDS, 93% with AIDS-related complex (ARC), 69% with generalized lymphadenopathy (LAS), and 35% of asymptomatic homosexuals were positive for virus in the RT assay. Transmission of the virus from RT-positive lymphocytes into the CEM cell line was successful in 10 of 11 randomly chosen cases. No virus isolates were obtained from lymphocytes of 8 heterosexual individuals. Serum antibodies against AIDS-associated virus were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay and confirmed by Western blotting, using an LAV/HTLV-III-producer cell line, LAV-N1, which we established. LAV/N1 virus was purified by ultracentrifugation through sucrose gradient and the pattern of its proteins was determined by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using sera from an AIDS patient. The major polypeptides of LAV/HTLV-III (19, 25-27, 32, 42 and 54 kilodalton) were present. These proteins did not react in Western blots with sera positive for Adult T cell leukemia virus (ATLV). thus, LAV-N1 and ATLV were not antigenically related. In our assay for LAV/HTLV-III antibodies, 18 (100%) of patients with AIDS, 13 (100%) of patients with ARC, 24 (69%) of 35 patients with LAS and 9 (39%) of 23 asymptomatic homosexuals were sero-positive. Heterosexual controls were negative. All IF-positive sera tested by Western blot contained antibodies against specific viral proteins. High titers (greater than or equal to 1:1280) of serum antibodies against LAV/HTLV-III virus were detected in 71% of AIDS patients, 62% with ARC, 38% LAS and 13% among asymptomatic homosexuals. Our data show that the presence of LAV/HTLV-III antibodies correlates with the presence of infectious virus. Antibody titers may also correlate with progression toward AIDS."
1895,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) DNA in peripheral blood cells of HIV-1 infected individuals may be present as integrated and/or unintegrated DNA. Several reports have indicated that a major proportion of HIV-1 DNA in the asymptomatic phase is linear, full-length, and unintegrated and in the symptomatic phase either circular unintegrated or integrated in the host genome. We developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to detect single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions, reflecting the presence of unintegrated single-LTR circles. In vitro infection of a CD4+ T-cell line resulted first in the increase of single-LTR junctions followed by syncytium formation and a rise of p24 antigen production. The number of single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions was further studied in two acutely infected individuals and in 21 long-term infected individuals. The number of single-LTR junctions was significantly correlated with CD4+ cell decline, p24 antigen expression, and total HIV-1 DNA content of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions were absent from PBMC containing other forms of HIV-1 DNA in four of nine non/slow progressors relative to 2 of 12 rapid progressors/AIDS patients. We conclude from our data that quantitative detection of single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions can be used as an early DNA marker of the transition from clinical latency to active replication in the peripheral blood."
5298,0.001,1.0000,"More than 18 million persons in the world are estimated to have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). As immunodeficiency progresses, these persons become susceptible to a wide variety of opportunistic infections (OIs) The spectrum of OIs varies among regions of the world. Tuberculosis is the most common serious OI in sub-Saharan Africa and is also more common in Latin America and in Asia than in the United States. Bacterial and parasitic infections are prevalent in Africa; protozoal infections such as toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, and isosporiasis are also common in Latin America. Fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and Penicillium marneffei infection, appear to be prevalent in Southeast Asia. Despite limited health resources in these regions, some measures that are recommended to prevent OIs in the United States may be useful for prolonging and improving the quality of life of HIV-infected persons. These include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, and bacterial infections; isoniazid to prevent tuberculosis; and 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine to prevent disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Research is needed to determine the spectrum of OIs and the efficacy of various prevention measures in resource-poor nations, and health officials need to determine a minimum standard of care for HIV-infected persons. An increasing problem in the developing world, HIV/AIDS should receive attention comparable to other tropical diseases."
9213,0.001,1.0000,"The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is required for the entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) into target cells and for the development and dissemination of various types of cancers, including gastrointestinal, cutaneous, head and neck, pulmonary, gynecological, genitourinary, neurological, and hematological malignancies. The T-cell (T)-tropic HIV-1 strains use CXCR4 as the entry coreceptor; consequently, multiple CXCR4 antagonistic inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, other potential applications of CXCR4 antagonists have become apparent since its discovery in 1996. In fact, increasing evidence demonstrates that epithelial and hematopoietic tumor cells exploit the interaction between CXCR4 and its natural ligand, stromal cellderived factor (SDF)-1α, which normally regulates leukocyte migration. The CXCR4 and/or SDF-1α expression patterns in tumor cells also determine the sites of metastatic spread. In addition, the activation of CXCR4 by SDF-1α promotes invasion and proliferation of tumor cells, enhances tumor-associated neoangiogenesis, and assists in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and basement membrane. As such, the evaluation of CXCR4 and/or SDF-1α expression levels has a significant prognostic value in various types of malignancies. Several therapeutic challenges remain to be overcome before the use of CXCR4 inhibitors can be translated into clinical practice, but promising preclinical data demonstrate that CXCR4 antagonists can mobilize tumor cells from their protective microenvironments, interfere with their metastatic and tumorigenic potentials, and/or make tumor cells more susceptible to chemotherapy. "
1449,0.001,1.0000,"Pulmonary infections are a very common complication in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. These infections may be severe enough to initiate the admission of these patients to intensive care units (ICU). Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is the most frequent cause of ICU admission because of acute respiratory failure. Mortality of ICU-admitted patients with this infection has changed with time. Initial reports confirmed a high mortality (80% to 90%). After 1985, the mortality rate decreased (50%). Factors such as the use of corticosteroids, better patient care, and a better knowledge of the disease probably explain this change. In recent years (1990 to 1995), mortality has worsened again, perhaps, because ICU facilities were offered more liberally to patients failing aggressive conventional treatment, including adjuvant therapy with corticosteroids. However, for those patients able to be discharged, the prognosis is not worse than expected according to the stage of their human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection and immunologic status. Consequently, at least a limited period of ICU care and some respiratory support (either continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation) should be considered and offered to all HIV-1-infected patients with PCP and respiratory failure. Cytomegalovirus may be another cause of severe pulmonary infection in AIDS patients. This infection is difficult to diagnose; hence, it should be suspected when patients with PCP do not progress appropriately, or when no responsible pulmonary pathogen is found. When associated with PCP, mortality is very high. Disseminated tuberculosis is another potential cause of severe respiratory failure and respiratory secretions should be routinely examined for acid-fast bacilli in AIDS patients with pulmonary infiltrates. Finally, bacterial pneumonia (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) may also be the etiological agents of severe acute respiratory failure. Empiric antibacterial treatment to cover these microorganisms should be given when a bacterial agent is suspected."
3636,0.001,1.0000,"Deficiency in antioxidant micronutrients have been observed in patients with AIDS. These observations concerning only some isolated nutrients demonstrate a defect in zinc, selenium, and glutathione. An increase in free radical production and lipid peroxidation has been also found in these patients, and takes a great importance with recent papers presenting an immunodeficiency and more important an increase in HIV-1 replication secondary to free radicals overproduction. We have assessed different studies, trying to obtain a global view of the antioxidant status of these patients. In adults we observe a progressive decrease for zinc, selenium, and vitamin E with the severity of disease, except that selenium remains normal at stage II. However, the main dramatic decrease concerns carotenoids whose level at stage II is only half the normal value. To understand if these decreases in antioxidant and increases in oxidative stress occur secondary to the aggravation of the disease or, conversely, are responsible for it, we undertook a longitudinal survey of asymptotic patients. The preliminary results of this evaluation are presented. Paradoxically, lipid peroxidation is higher at stage II than at stage IV. This may be consecutive to a more intense overproduction of oxygen free radicals by more viable polymorphonuclear (PMN) at the asymptomatic stage. The free radicals production and lipid peroxidation seem secondary to a direct induction by the virus of PMN stimulation and cytokines secretion. N-Acetyl cysteine or ascorbate have been demonstrated in cell culture to be capable of blocking the expression of HIV-1 after oxidative stress and N-acetyl cysteine inhibits in vitro TNF-induced apoptosis of infected cells. In regard to all these experimental data, few serious and large trials of antioxidants have been conducted in HIV-infected patients, although some preliminary studies using zinc or selenium have been performed. In our opinion it is now time to evaluate in humans the beneficial effect of antioxidants. The more promising candidates for presenting synergistic effects when associated with N-acetyl cysteine seem to be beta-carotene, selenium and zinc."
3309,0.001,1.0000,"The processes of transcription and posttranscription are assumed to proceed in close association with the nuclear matrix. In this study we demonstrated that Tat, the trans-activating protein from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), binds both to the TAR region of the nascent HIV mRNAs and the nuclear matrix with high affinity. Both North/Western blotting experiments and nitrocellulose binding studies revealed that Tat binds with an association constant (K alpha) of approximately 1 x 10(9) M-1 to the TAR segment of HIV RNA; binding of Tat to this sequence which is present between position 32 and 82 downstream from the TATA box was also confirmed by gel retardation assays. Binding of Tat to TAR only occurs if the loop segment in the proposed stem-loop secondary structure of HIV leader mRNA is present. Likewise, Tat binds to the nuclear matrix with a K alpha of 7.5 x 10(7) M-1. The number of binding sites has been estimated to be 2 x 10(8)/micrograms of matrix protein, corresponding to 4 x 10(3) sites/nucleus. Tat displays its bimodal function only in the presence of Zn2+ ions. In vitro transcription experiments, using HIV-1 infected nuclei, demonstrate that beyond the TAR-region HIV RNA synthesis occurs only in the presence of Tat. Present studies indicate that Tat may function as a linker by binding of nascent HIV RNAs to the nuclear matrix."
7208,0.001,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-Tat protein has been implicated in the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection. However, its role in modulating astroglial-neuronal relationships is poorly understood. Astrocyte infection with HIV has been associated with rapid progression of dementia. We thus initially transfected astrocytes with HIV proviral DNA and confirmed Tat production in these cells. Subsequently, using stably Tat-producing asytocyte cell lines, we observed that Tat promoted astrocyte survival by causing a prominent antioxidant effect and resistance to cell injury in these cells. Tat was released extracellularly where it could be taken up by other cells. Tat remained functionally active following uptake and caused long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation in lymphocytic and astrocytic cell lines. Tat released from astrocytes caused mitochondrial dysfunction, trimming of neurites, and cell death in neurons. Tat neurotoxicity was attenuated by anti-Tat antibodies, kynurenate or heparan sulfate. The neurotoxic effects of Tat were caused at concentrations lower than that needed to cause LTR transactivation. When Tat-expressing cells were injected into the rat dentate gyrus, Tat was taken up by granule cells and transported along neuronal pathways to the CA3 region where it caused glial cell activation and neurotoxicity. The arginine-rich domain of Tat was essential for both the LTR transactivation and the neurotoxic properties of Tat. Thus HIV-Tat is a potent neurotoxin that may act at distant sites while at the same time it assures its production by preventing cell death in astrocytes where it is produced."
9325,0.001,1.0000,"The major group of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains that comprise the current global pandemic have diversified during their worldwide spread into at least 10 distinct subtypes, or clades. Subtype C predominates in sub-Saharan Africa and is responsible for the majority of worldwide HIV-1 infections, subtype B predominates in North America and Europe, and subtype E is prevalent in Southeast Asia. Significant amino acid variations have been observed among the clade-specific Tat proteins. For the present study, we examined clade-specific interactions between Tat, transactivation-responsive (TAR) element, and P-TEFb proteins and how these interactions may modulate the efficiency of HIV-1 transcription. Clade-specific Tat proteins significantly modified viral gene expression. Tat proteins derived from HIV-1 clades C and E were strong transactivators of long terminal repeat (LTR) activity; Tat E also had a longer half-life than the other Tat proteins and interacted more efficiently with the stem-loop TAR element. Chimeric Tat proteins harboring the Tat E activation domain were strong transactivators of LTR expression. While Tat B, C, and E were able to rescue a Tat-defective HIV-1 proviral clone, Tat E was significantly more efficient at rescue than Tat C, possibly due to the relative stability of the Tat protein. Swapping the activation domains of Tat B, C, and E identified the cyclin T1 association domain as a critical determinant of the transactivation efficiency and of Tat-defective HIV-1 provirus rescue."
1820,0.001,1.0000,"One key step of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the integration of its viral cDNA. This process is mediated through complex networks of host-virus interactions that alter several normal cell functions of the host. To study the complexity of disturbances in cell gene expression networks by HIV-1 integration, we constructed a network of human macrophage genes located close to chromatin regions rich in proviruses. To perform the network analysis, we selected 28 genes previously identified as the target of cDNA integration and their transcriptional profiles were obtained from GEO Profiles (NCBI). A total of 2770 interactions among the 28 genes located around the HIV-1 proviruses in human macrophages formed a highly dense main network connected to five sub-networks. The overall network was significantly enriched by genes associated with signal transduction, cellular communication and regulatory processes. To simulate the effects of HIV-1 integration in infected macrophages, five genes with the most number of interaction in the normal network were turned off by putting in zero the correspondent expression values. The HIV-1 infected network showed changes in its topology and alteration in the macrophage functions reflected in a re-programming of biosynthetic and general metabolic process. Understanding the complex virus-host interactions that occur during HIV-1 integration, may provided valuable genomic information to develop new antiviral treatments focusing on the management of some specific gene expression networks associated with viral integration. This is the first gene network which describes the human macrophages genes interactions related with HIV-1 integration."
8468,0.001,1.0000,"Recently, a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutant with HBe antigen-negative phenotype has been characterized, in which one TATA box-like motif of the precore/core promoter had degenerated: most frequently by both A-->T and G-->A mutations at positions 1762 and 1764, respectively. The clinical significance of this mutant is as yet unknown. In our present study, the T1762 A1764 mutant was sought in sera from HBV-infected blood donors and chronic liver disease patients by directly sequencing a PCR-amplified region of HBVDNA. Also, because the A1764 mutation generates a Sau3AI cleavage site (GGTC-->GATC), we digested the PCR products with Sau3AI to see if cleavage would occur at this specific site. Our results mostly corroborated the earlier report but we found a higher-than-predicted frequency of HBe antigen-positive blood donors positive for the mutant (22%). The titres of HBe antigen in these mutant-positive sera were slightly decreased compared to the titres in wild-type HBV infection. In addition, these blood donors had relatively high (though within the normal range) serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, suggesting that the T1762 A1764 mutation could be used as a sensitive laboratory marker for insidious hepatitis in these otherwise 'asymptomatic' carriers. The Sau3AI assay, which is much more convenient than sequencing, was shown to be useful for the detection of the T1762 A1764 mutant in an extensive number of clinical samples."
4731,0.001,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy has greatly reduced AIDS-related morbidity and mortality; however, its widespread use has been associated with a marked rise in the frequency of cardiovascular diseases in patients with HIV. Moreover, HIV infection is associated with accelerated coronary atherosclerosis and vasculopathy, although the mechanisms underlying these findings have not been determined. We describe the case of a 45-year-old woman with HIV/HCV coinfection, irritable bowel syndrome, and accelerated progression of coronary atherosclerosis after execution of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this case, the rapidity of progression of atherosclerosis seems linked principally to chronic inflammation and excess immune activation that can depend by a concourse of factors (chronic C hepatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, PCI execution) not directly associated with traditional risk factors. Caregivers following HIV-infected patients should be aware of the increased risk of accelerated atherogenesis in these subjects, principally in case of presence of causes of intense immune activation."
8665,0.001,1.0000,"High levels of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication, as reflected in HIV-1 RNA concentrations in blood and semen, probably contribute to both rapid disease progression and enhanced sexual transmission. Semen and blood were collected from 49 Malawian and 61 US and Swiss (US/Swiss) HIV-1-seropositive men with similar CD4 cell counts and no urethritis or exposure to antiretroviral drugs. Median seminal plasma and blood plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations were >3-fold (P = .034) and 5-fold (P = .0003) higher, respectively, in the Malawian men. Similar differences were observed in subsets of the Malawian and US/Swiss study groups matched individually for CD4 cell count (P = .035 and P < .002, respectively). These observations may help explain the high rates of HIV-1 sexual transmission and accelerated HIV-1 disease progression in sub-Saharan Africa."

379,0.001,1.0000,"For identification of risk factors for progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 746 homosexual men participating in a cohort study in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, were studied since October 1984. A total of 234 of these men were HIV antibody-positive at baseline, and 52 seroconverted during follow-up. These 286 individuals were categorized as high- and low-risk for progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on the basis of the presence or absence of HIV antigenemia, antibody to HIV core antigen, or a number of T helper lymphocytes less than 0.5 x 10(9)/liter during three or more subsequential blood samples. Ninety-six (41%) of the seropositives and 32 (62%) of those who seroconverted remained low-risk throughout the study period. Bivariate analyses revealed that educational level and a history of herpes zoster were associated with a low- and high-risk status, respectively. In multivariate analyses, a history of herpes zoster and a history of sexual intercourse with a person who had AIDS were associated with a more rapid disease progression. While herpes zoster is considered to be a marker of progressive immunodeficiency, a history of having sexual intercourse with a person who had AIDS points to the more virulent properties of HIV in these persons. Because both seropositives and seroconverters who had sexual intercourse with a person with AIDS had a more rapid disease progression, it seems plausible that being infected by a person with AIDS is a risk factor for a relative short incubation period."
674,0.001,1.0000,"The impact of psychosocial status at onset of antiretroviral therapy on changes in quality of life (QOL) and subjectively rated health (SRH) among adults on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in resource-limited settings is poorly understood. Therefore, we evaluate the association between stigma, anxiety, depression, and social support and change in QOL and SRH in HIV-infected Ugandan adults during an 18-month period. Psychosocial indicators were assessed at enrollment using structured questionnaires. QOL and SRH measures were assessed at months 0, 6, 12, and 18 using the Medical Outcomes Survey-HIV. Linear mixed models determined risk estimated differences in QOL and SRH in relation to quartiles of each psychosocial status indicator. Repeated measures generalized estimating equations modeling was implemented to assess differences in likelihood of improved versus nonimproved SRH during follow-up.QOL scores and SRH improved significantly for all participants over 18 months (P < 0.0001). The gain in QOL increased dose-dependently as baseline depressive symptoms (time*depression P < 0.001) and anxiety levels (time*anxiety P < 0.001) declined. Lower social support was associated with worse QOL at baseline (P = 0.0005) but QOL improvement during follow-up was not dependent on baseline level of social support (time*social support P = 0.8943) or number of stigmatizing experiences (time*stigma P = 0.8662). Psychosocial determinants did not predict changes in SRH in this study. High levels of depression and anxiety symptoms at HAART initiation predicts lower gains in QOL for HIV-positive patients for as long as 18 months. Long-term QOL improvements in HIV-infected adults may be enhanced by implementation of psychosocial interventions to reduce depression and anxiety in HIV-infected adults."
7565,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most dangerous malignancies with an increasing incidence and a high mortality rate, represents a major international health problem. HCC progression is known to involve genome-wide alteration of epigenetic modifications, leading to aberrant gene expression patterns. The activity of CYP2C19, an important member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, was reported to be compromised in HCC, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To understand whether epigenetic modification in HCC is associated with a change in CYP2C19 activity, we evaluated the expression levels of CYP2C19 and its transcription factors by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using mRNA extracted from both primary hepatocytes and paired tumor versus nontumor liver tissues of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). DNA methylation was examined by bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Our results indicated that CYP2C19 could be regulated by e-box methylation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Decreased CYP2C19 expression in tumorous tissues of HBV-infected patients with HCC was highly correlated with suppressed expression and promoter hypermethylation of CAR. Our study demonstrates that aberrant CAR methylation is involved in CYP2C19 regulation in HBV-related HCC and may play a role in liver tumorigenesis."
4377,0.001,1.0000,"In order to assess the prevalence rate of HTLV-1-associated T-cell lymphomas and human retrovirus infection in general, approximately 21,000 individuals representing various patient populations, retroviral risk groups, and blood donors were examined for HTLV-I, HTLV-II, HIV-1, or HIV-2 infection using serologic and PCR assays. The prevalence rates among volunteer blood donors were 0.02% and 0% for HTLV and HIV, respectively. Significantly increased HTLV prevalence rates were observed among paid blood donors, African American health care clinic patients, Amerindians, recipients of HTLV-positive cellular blood products, intravenous drug users, sexual contacts and family members of HTLV-positive people, and patients with primary thrombocytosis and other-than-low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Among some of these groups there were significant differences in the prevalence of HTLV-I versus HTLV-II. The eight HTLV-positive NHL patients all had mature, high-grade, CD4+ T-cell lymphomas with clonally integrated HTLV-I, for a prevalence of 4% among other-than-low-grade NHL patients. Seven of the eight died from their disease within 2 years despite treatment. Interestingly, two groups at risk for HTLV infection, namely needle stick victims and recipients of HTLV-infected and/or pooled plasma products, showed no evidence for infection. Significantly increased HIV-1 prevalence was observed among paid blood donors, African Americans, homosexuals, female prostitutes, hemophiliacs, and other-than-low-grade NHL patients. Only one patient was infected with HIV-2. Of the nine HIV-positive, other-than-low-grade NHL patients, seven HIV-1 positives had B-cell lymphomas, one HIV-1 positive had an HTLV-I-positive CD4+ T-cell lymphoma, and one infected with HIV-2 had a CD4+ T-cell lymphoma that was HTLV negative. The data indicate that HTLV-I lymphoma, while uncommon, is not necessarily rare among other-than-low-grade NHL cases in the United States and, given its poor prognosis, should probably be studied separately in clinical trials."
3464,0.001,1.0000,"Despite substantial benefits of HAART treatment of HIV-infected patients, cumulative long-term toxicity, including drug-induced hepatotoxicity, has emerged as an important complication. Thus, to examine the prevalence and risk of developing severe hepatic injury during HAART, we conducted a retrospective study in a cohort of 364 HIV-infected patients treated with HAART between January 1998 and May 2006, for whom data on alanine aminotransferase activity were available both before and during HAART. HCV co-infection was recorded in 35.4% of the series, but was found not to influence either the efficacy of HAART or survival (P>0.05). Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in a total of 24 patients (6.6%). Multivariate logistic regression defined HCV co-infection (OR 16.6, 95% CI 3.8-46.0, P<0.0001), and the use of SQV/RTV and d4T (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2-8.16, P=0.02, and OR 7.1, 95% CI 1.0-54.5, P=0.05, respectively) as independent risk factors for aggravation of hepatitis. In addition, there was a significant increase in the probability of developing liver damage over years of treatment (Log rank, P<0.01). Conversely, the probability of developing hepatotoxicity was not associated with an increase in the CD4 cell count to values greater than 350/microL (Log rank, P=0.59). In conclusion, in the setting of chronic viral hepatitis, hepatotoxicity during HAART may be attributed to the cumulative toxicity of drugs that induce mitochondrial toxicity, along with particular PIs and/or NNRTIs. Furthermore, our data suggest prudent use of D-drugs, still common in resource-limited countries, in HCV co-infected patients."
5925,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects and destroys cells of the immune system leading to an overt immune deficiency known as HIV acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). The gut associated lymphoid tissue is one of the major lymphoid tissues targeted by HIV-1, and is considered a reservoir for HIV-1 replication and of major importance in CD4+ T-cell depletion. In addition to immunodeficiency, HIV-1 infection also directly causes gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, also known as HIV enteropathy. This enteropathy can manifest itself as many pathological changes in the GI tract. The objective of this study was to determine the association of gut HIV-1 infection markers with long-term survival in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM) enrolled pre-HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy). We examined survival over 15-years in a cohort of 42 HIV-infected cases: In addition to CD4+ T cell counts and HIV-1 plasma viral load, multiple gut compartment (duodenum and colon) biopsies were taken by endoscopy every 6 months during the initial 3-year period. HIV-1 was cultured from tissues and phenotyped and viral loads in the gut tissues were determined. Moreover, the tissues were subjected to an extensive assessment of enteroendocrine cell distribution and pathology. The collected data was used for survival analyses, which showed that patients with higher gut tissue viral load levels had a significantly worse survival prognosis. Moreover, lower numbers of serotonin (duodenum) and somatostatin (duodenum and colon) immunoreactive cell counts in the gut tissues of patients was associated with significant lower survival prognosis. Our study, suggested that HIV-1 pathogenesis and survival prognosis is associated with altered enteroendocrine cell numbers, which could point to a potential role for enteroendocrine function in HIV infection and pathogenesis.

5994,0.001,1.0000,"Subjects at risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are also at high risk of acute and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HIV is associated with higher HBV viraemia and with the risk of HBV reactivation, chronic active HBV infection, cirrhosis and death. Therefore, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all HIV-infected subjects lacking prior immunity. However, the immune response to hepatitis B vaccine is frequently suboptimal in this population. High CD4+ cell counts and low HIV viraemia are well known factors associated with a better rate of response. Moreover, higher hepatitis B vaccine doses and/or prolongation of the vaccination schedule, as implemented for patients with immune deficiencies other than HIV, may be considered. New vaccination cycles should be considered if post-vaccination titers of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen are < 10 mIU/mL (< 10 UI/L). The immunization of all young and middle-aged adults appears to be the most useful strategy to protect all patient-populations at high risk of sexually transmitted diseases."
7752,0.001,1.0000,"We investigated the expression of Pre-S2 antigen (Ag) and antibody (Ab) in sera quantitatively using ELISA. Four patients with acute hepatitis B and 87 chronic HBV carriers were included in this study. We also investigated the expression of Pre-S2Ag in the liver tissues obtained from 26 chronic HBV carriers by direct fluorescent antibody method. There was a significant correlation between Pre-S2Ag titers and HBsAg titers in sera. Pre-S2Ag titers were higher in sera positive for HBeAg, HBV-related DNA polymerase or HBV-DNA than in sera negative for those markers. The ratio of Pre-S2Ag titers to HBsAg titers, however, was constant irrespective of virus replicative markers. Pre-S2Ag in the liver had almost same intracellular localization with HBsAg in the liver. It was suggested that Pre-S2Ag was expressed with an intimate relation to the expression of HBsAg and was not useful as a virus replicative marker. Pre-S2Ag titers/HBsAg titers tended to be high in patients with chronic active hepatitis and high serum GPT levels compared to patients with chronic inactive hepatitis. This may be explained by the release of Pre-S2Ag in the liver. In addition, all patients positive for Pre-S2Ag on the membrane of hepatocytes had chronic active hepatitis. The overproduction of Pre-S2-containing surface proteins in the liver may have some implication related to cell injury via the immune response to Pre-S2Ag etc. Pre-S2Ab was detected only in few cases of chronic HBV infected patients. The lack of immune response to Pre-S2 region may play a role in the persistence of HBV infection."
2926,0.001,1.0000,"Several noninvasive blood biomarkers have been established for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but their clinical performance remains inconclusive. Here, we compared the diagnostic performance of these biomarkers and developed a novel algorithm for assessing liver fibrosis. Six hundred and sixteen chronically HBV-infected and treatment-naïve patients who underwent liver biopsy were enrolled and randomly divided into training (N=410) and internal validation cohorts (N=206). One hundred and fifty-nine patients from another centre were recruited as an external validation cohort. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyse the performance of the gamma-glutamyltransferase-to-platelet ratio (GPR), red cell volume distribution width-to-platelet ratio (RPR), FIB-4 index, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and HBV DNA level against liver histology, and a novel algorithm was developed using the recursive partitioning and regression tree (RPART) method. In the training cohort, the area under the ROC curve of FIB-4 was significantly higher than that of APRI (P=.038) but was comparable to those of GPR, RPR and HBV DNA; however, the performance of the biomarkers was similar among the validation cohort. The established RPR-HBV DNA algorithm performed better in the training cohort than any individual blood biomarker, and the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 63%, 90%, 72% and 80%, respectively. In the internal and external validation cohorts, the performance of the algorithm in assessing liver fibrosis was also superior to that of other biomarkers. These results suggest that the established RPR-HBV DNA algorithm might improve the diagnostic accuracy of liver fibrosis in treatment-naïve patients with chronic HBV infection, although additional studies are warranted to confirm these findings."
4137,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes persistent infection in the majority of infected individuals. The mechanisms of persistence and clearance are only partially understood. Antibodies (Abs) against host cell entry receptors have been shown to inhibit HCV infection in cell culture and animal models. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether anti-receptor Abs are induced during infection in humans in vivo and whether their presence is associated with outcome of infection. We established an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay using a recombinant CD81-claudin-1 (CLDN1) fusion protein to detect and quantify Abs directed against extracellular epitopes of the HCV CD81-CLDN1 coreceptor complex. The presence of anti-receptor Abs was studied in serum of patients from a well-defined cohort of a single-source HCV outbreak of pregnant women and several control groups, including uninfected pregnant women, patients with chronic hepatitis B and D virus (HBV/HDV) infection, and healthy individuals. Virus-neutralizing activity of Abs was determined using recombinant cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc). Our results demonstrate that HCV-infected patients have statistically significantly higher anti-CD81/CLDN1 Ab titers during the early phase of infection than controls. The titers were significantly higher in resolvers compared to persisters. Functional studies using immunoadsorption and HCV cell culture models demonstrate that HCV-neutralizing anti-receptor Abs are induced in the early phase of HCV infection, but not in control groups."
3007,0.001,1.0000,"Low vitamin D levels in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV) infected persons are associated with more rapid disease progression and increased risk for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We have previously shown that 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25D3), the active form of vitamin D, inhibits HIV replication in human macrophages through the induction of autophagy. In this study, we report that physiological concentrations of 1,25D3 induce the production of the human cathelicidin microbial peptide (CAMP) and autophagic flux in HIV and M. tuberculosis co-infected human macrophages which inhibits mycobacterial growth and the replication of HIV. Using RNA interference for Beclin-1 and the autophagy-related 5 homologue, combined with the chemical inhibitors of autophagic flux, bafilomycin A₁, an inhibitor of autophagosome-lysosome fusion and subsequent acidification, and SID 26681509 an inhibitor of the lysosome hydrolase cathepsin L, we show that the 1,25D3-mediated inhibition of HIV replication and mycobacterial growth during single infection or dual infection is dependent not only upon the induction of autophagy, but also through phagosomal maturation. Moreover, through the use of RNA interference for CAMP, we demonstrate that cathelicidin is essential for the 1,25D3 induced autophagic flux and inhibition of HIV replication and mycobacterial growth. The present findings provide a biological explanation for the benefits and importance of vitamin D sufficiency in HIV and M. tuberculosis-infected persons, and provide new insights into novel approaches to prevent and treat HIV infection and related opportunistic infections."
5571,0.001,1.0000,"Immunohistochemical detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) was used to identify EBV-associated Ki-1-positive anaplastic large-cell (ALC) lymphomas occurring in 11 patients with and 29 patients without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In addition, 18 representative cases of other acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphomas and 66 cases of Hodgkin's disease, including 14 patients with HIV infection, were investigated. In patients with HIV infection, LMP-1 was found more frequently in Ki-1-positive ALC lymphomas than in other histotypes, although the difference in EBV association between Ki-1-positive ALC and other lymphomas was not significant. In these patients, the percentage of LMP-1 expressing Ki-1-positive ALC lymphomas was significantly higher than that found in patients without HIV infection (72.7% vs. 24.1%; P < .01), thus suggesting an etiologic role for EBV in a large proportion of AIDS-related Ki-1-positive ALC lymphomas. Moreover, the frequency of LMP-1 expression in Hodgkin's disease cases (71.4% in patients with and 21.1% in patients without HIV infection) was close to that found in Ki-1-positive ALC lymphoma cases, supporting the view that the higher frequency of EBV association with both entities detected in patients with HIV infection may be AIDS-related."
6627,0.001,1.0000,"Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is associated with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). Other inflammatory disorders may occur in HTLV-I-infected patients, such as sicca syndrome resembling Sjögren's syndrome. The sicca syndrome may be the unique clinical manifestation of HTLV-I infection, but is associated frequently with TSP/HAM, which could suggest that sicca syndrome might be an early event in disease progression to TSP/HAM in some cases. We investigated whether peculiar pX and LTR mutations could be related to sicca syndrome, or might argue the existence of clinical progression to TSP/HAM. pX, especially pX(I), pX(II), and pX(IV) ORFs corresponding to Tax cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes, and LTR regions from Caribbean patients who have sicca syndrome with or without TSP/HAM, ATL patients, and healthy carriers were sequenced. The sequences were aligned and compared with ATK-1 prototype and published sequences. LTR sequences exhibited 1.5-2.4% of divergence with ATK-1. pX-sequenced regions showed a lower homology within p12(I) encoding sequences. Only few mutations were found within functionally important regions, but were not associated specifically with the clinical status. Finally, no mutations that could be related to sicca syndrome or argue the existence of clinical progression to TSP/HAM were found. It would be of interest to study the clinical evolution of HTLV-I-sicca syndrome in patients and to determine HTLV-I sequences from peripheral blood and salivary glands at different stages."
4578,0.001,1.0000,"This study was undertaken to analyze the role of disialoganglioside GD3 in HIV infection and disease progression. We report here the results obtained by both ex vivo and in vitro experiments on (1) surface and cytoplasmic expression and distribution of GD3 in HIV-infected cells, (2) the presence of anti-GD3 antibodies in sera of patients with HIV infection in various stages of the disease, and (3) the association of GD3 expression with HIV-related apoptotic events. GD3 expression was determined by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and lipid-bound sialic acid and by static and flow cytometric analyses in peripheral blood lymphocytes from 22 AIDS patients, 20 anti-HIV Ab(+) asymptomatic subjects, and 25 healthy donors. Results obtained clearly indicated a significantly higher expression of plasma membrane GD3 content in lymphocytes from HIV-infected patients with respect to healthy controls. These HIV-induced perturbations of glycosphingolipid metabolism could be detected in all stages of the disease, including asymptomatic individuals. In addition, a significant percentage of patients showing disease progression displayed in serum samples an increased presence of anti-GD3 antibodies. Interestingly, ex vivo studies of lymphocytes from patients with HIV infection also indicated that GD3 expression is strictly associated with annexin V binding, an early marker of apoptosis. Moreover, cytofluorimetric analysis showed that virtually all anti-p24 Ab-positive cells were also immunolabeled with anti-GD3 antibodies. Accordingly, in vitro studies showed a significant redistribution and increase in GD3 expression in cultured U937 cells chronically infected with HIV-1 with respect to uninfected counterparts. In conclusion, our data clearly indicate that a significant increase in GD3 content in HIV-infected lymphocytes can occur and that this GD3 overexpression is paralleled by the presence of anti-GD3 antibodies in the plasma of patients. This is the first demonstration that disialoganglioside GD3, independent of the therapeutic schedule employed, can be considered as one of the early markers of HIV infection and can contribute to the early events leading to T cell depletion by apoptosis."
4715,0.001,1.0000,"Costs of medications for ambulatory HIV-infected people increase as knowledge of antiretroviral therapy and therapy for opportunistic infection grows. We evaluated the evolution of drug costs for HIV-infected persons who attend a university clinic in Baltimore, Maryland. Cross-sectional abstracts of a cohort of patients for four periods, corresponding to landmark changes in therapy, who attended the clinic between June 1995 and September 1996 were obtained. Monthly medication costs for all patients were calculated. Mean costs increased significantly (p < .01) from period 1 ($447 U.S.) to period 4 ($1048 U.S.). Multivariate analysis only revealed higher costs for patients with a CD4+ count <200 cells/mm3 (p < .001). The proportion of costs attributable to antiretroviral therapy increased from 34% in period 1 to 53% in period 4. Combination therapy increased >10-fold, from 8% in period 1 to 94% in period 4. Protease inhibitor use also increased significantly, from 4% in period 2 to 53% in period 4. We quantified the increase in costs of medications from mid-1995 to late 1996. Increases in costs appear to be the result of increasing complexity of drug regimens, particularly antiretroviral therapy in combinations."
919,0.001,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy is increasingly available in African communities. We set out to gain patient perceptions on factors that facilitate and challenge access and adherence to such therapy. We carried out two semi-structured interviews 12 months apart with 40 HIV-positive people drawn from three economically deprived townships in the Copperbelt, Zambia. We also conducted a focus group of 12 of these interviewees. Availability of medication in health facilities did not automatically ensure access to those in need. A prerequisite for commencing on treatment was a positive documented HIV test result, but too few HIV testing centres, fear of family and community rejection and male domination in sexual and social decision-making prevented a number from coming forward to be tested. Once within the system of care, further barriers, such as rumours of bad side-effects, inconsistent information, high costs of drugs (at the time of the first interviews), ongoing costs of additional medical tests, overcrowded systems and overworked staff, all hindered access to receiving treatment. When taken, therapy brought side-effects, the most common being increased appetite and hunger. Yet, despite these barriers and challenges many of those on treatment reported good adherence. Immediate factors, such as seeing ill people becoming well; being supported by a friend or family member; and having a watch or clock to keep to a regular regime, were important. The increase in the number of people who were expected to die but were now looking well also shifted community attitudes. HIV/AIDS is beginning to move from a hidden terminal disease to a chronic condition that is treatable."
2374,0.001,1.0000,"Currently available human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA quantification assays can detect most viruses of the group M subtypes, but a substantial number are missed or not quantified reliably. Viruses of HIV-1 group O cannot be detected by any commercially available assay. We developed and evaluated a quantitative assay based on nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) technology, with primers and probes located in the conserved long terminal repeat (LTR) region of the HIV-1 genome. In 68 of 72 serum samples from individuals infected with HIV-1 subtypes A to H of group M, viruses could be detected and quantified. In serum samples from two patients infected with HIV-1 group O viruses, these viruses as well could be detected and quantified. In contrast, the currently used gag-based assay underestimated the presence of subtype A viruses and could not detect subtype G and group O viruses. The discrepancy between the results of the two assays may be explained by the number of mismatches found within and among the probe and primer regions of the subtype isolates. These data indicate that LTR-based assays, including the NASBA format chosen here, are better suited to monitoring HIV-1 therapy than are gag-based assays in an era in which multiple HIV-1 subtypes and groups are spreading worldwide."
4259,0.001,1.0000,"It has previously been demonstrated that there are two distinct mechanisms for genetic resistance to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) conferred by the CCR5Delta32 gene: the loss of wild-type CCR5 surface expression and the generation of CCR5Delta32 protein, which interacts with CXCR4. To analyse the protective effects of long-term expression of the CCR5Delta32 protein, recombinant lentiviral vectors were used to deliver the CCR5Delta32 gene into human cell lines and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells that had been immortalized by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Blasticidin S-resistant cell lines expressing the lentivirus-encoded CCR5Delta32 showed a significant reduction in HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion assays. It was shown that CD4(+) T lymphocytes expressing the lentivirus-encoded CCR5Delta32 gene were highly resistant to infection by a primary but not by a laboratory-adapted X4 strain, suggesting different infectivity requirements. In contrast to previous studies that analysed the CCR5Delta32 protective effects in a transient expression system, this study showed that long-term expression of CCR5Delta32 conferred resistance to HIV-1 despite cell-surface expression of the HIV co-receptors. The results suggest an additional unknown mechanism for generating the CCR5Delta32 resistance phenotype and support the hypothesis that the CCR5Delta32 protein acts as an HIV-suppressive factor by altering the stoichiometry of the molecules involved in HIV-1 entry. The lentiviral-CCR5Delta32 vectors offer a method of generating HIV-resistant cells by delivery of the CCR5Delta32 gene that may be useful for stem cell- or T-cell-based gene therapy for HIV-1 infection."
7023,0.001,1.0000,"At least one-third of the 34 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide are infected with latent tuberculosis (TB). The aim of this study was to determine the rate of HIV infection in TB patients and its determinants in Wuxi City, China. TB patients attending health institutions (12 selected sites) for TB diagnosis and treatment were enrolled in this study. TB diagnosis, treatment and HIV testing were done according to the national guidelines. Blood samples were collected for anonymous HIV testing. Among the TB patients, the HIV prevalence was 13.66% (1493/10,926). Multivariate analysis showed that gender, age, education, marital status, per capita monthly income, patient residence, family size, distance from a health institution, knowledge of HIV-TB co-infection, and knowledge of HIV may be risk factors for HIV-TB co-infection (all: odds ratio > 1, p < 0.05). The prevalence of TB in those with HIV was higher among the study participants. Improving public awareness of HIV-TB co-infection, regularly screening and improving follow-up can reduce the occurrence of HIV-TB co-infection."
1303,0.001,1.0000,"Health literacy is known to influence medication adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS. People who experience difficulty reading health information may benefit from asking others to assist them with reading, interpreting, and understanding medical information. We examined medical chart-abstracted HIV viral load, medication adherence assessed by unannounced pill counts, and adherence improvement strategies among 245 individuals with lower-health literacy who do not request assistance, and 229 who do request assistance with reading and understanding health information. Participants were people living with HIV who were taking antiretroviral therapy and scored below 90% correct on a standardized test of functional health literacy. After controlling for health literacy scores, requesting informational assistance was associated with strategies used to improve adherence; individuals who asked for assistance were significantly more likely to use multiple adherence strategies. However, despite requesting informational assistance and using more adherence strategies, participants who requested informational assistance evidenced poorer treatment adherence and poorer suppression of HIV replication. Requesting assistance was more common among those with the poorest health literacy and therefore greatest challenges to adherence. People living with HIV who have poor health literacy skills may benefit from medication adherence programs and requests for assistance afford opportunities for social interventions."
2911,0.001,1.0000,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the elevation of liver enzyme and/or bilirubin levels caused by the use of a medication or drug. In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, some of these events may not be directly caused by medication. Acute viral hepatitis, reactivation of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and/or alcohol use may play roles. Elevated transaminase levels are a signal of liver injury, but most cases improve despite continuation of drug therapy. Approximately 33% of patients with HIV infection are coinfected with HCV. Patients with HIV or HCV infection are more prone to DILI, possibly because of impaired hepatocyte defense mechanisms. HCV coinfection is associated with a 2-10-fold chance of developing elevated transaminase levels during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Patients with HIV/HCV coinfection should not be denied HAART. Instead, they should be followed-up with monthly liver function tests and referred to specialists if grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme elevations occur."
8165,0.001,1.0000,"Over the last few years, a relative decline of the morbidity and mortality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in industrialised countries has been observed due to the use of a potent combined therapy known as high active antiretroviral therapies (HAARTs). It has led to a decrease of viral load and a quantitative and qualitative improvement of immune function in patients, especially CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, having as a consequence a decrease of infectious complications and a global clinical improvement. Besides the positive effects of HAARTs on immune and metabolic alterations during HIV infection, it has been reported that the commonly used drugs AZT, ddI, and ddC are toxic to hepatocytes. Recent reports continue to point to the mitochondria as targets for toxicity. The prevalence of these symptoms is continued during acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The effects of oxidative stress occurring as a consequence of mitochondrial toxicity may amplify some of the pathophysiological and phenotypic events during infection. Mitochondrial stabilisation and antioxidative strategies are possible new therapeutic aims since the antiretroviral treatment is prolonged with increased longevity from AIDS, which has become a more manageable chronic illness. The aim of the present review article is to summarize the current knowledge about mitochondrial dysfunction during HAART and its consequence for patients with chronic treatment. Oxidative stress may serve as one pathway for cellular damage in AIDS and its treatment. One important future goal is to prevent or attenuate the side effects of HAART so that improved disease management can be achieved."
5150,0.001,1.0000,"People with HIV and AIDS are living much longer today, thanks to a better understanding of the disease process and the development of effective antiviral drugs and multidrug therapies. Consequently, HIV is now considered a chronic disease, one that affects nearly 40 million people worldwide. Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), first instituted in 1996, has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of perinatally infected children; however, in 2004, there were still 640,000 children under the age of 15 living with HIV worldwide.1 This population of patients faces more mature health issues compared to most children their age. For example, rampant dental decay is common among children with HIV and requires advanced treatment planning that needs to be closely coordinated with members of the medical team. Maintaining good oral health in combination with medication compliance leads to sustained overall health in HIV-infected children; however, many of the medications these children take have severe adverse effects on their oral health. Furthermore, these medications may interfere with other medications that are prescribed or administered in connection with oral health care. Lastly, the systemic and oral manifestations of HIV and AIDS are different for children than they are for adults; as a result, the prognosis and treatment options for these manifestations vary, depending on the patient's age. This article will address factors that affect the oral health of HIV-infected children and adults, as well as common oral manifestations of HIV and AIDS. Key differences in treatment planning for HIV-infected children and HIV-infected adults will be outlined."

Referral rate for HIV testing was 4.4% (30/684) in 2007, 15.4% (116/751) in 2008, and 30.1% (283/940) in 2009, with a significant upward trend over the period of time (P = .009). The main barriers perceived by health providers were poor knowledge about TB/HIV, lack of communication skills, absence of any target plan for TB patient referral for HIV testing, and fear associated with informing positive test results to the TB patients and the associated stigma. Strategies to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS/TB among TB patients and their providers may improve the current state of low referral and its barriers in Cambodia. "
1184,0.001,1.0000,"Most patients failing antiretroviral treatment in Uganda continue to fail their treatment regimen even if a dominant drug-resistant HIV-1 genotype is not detected. In a recent retrospective study, we observed that approximately 30% of HIV-infected individuals in the Joint Clinical Research Centre (Kampala, Uganda) experienced virologic failure with a susceptible HIV-1 genotype based on standard Sanger sequencing. Selection of minority drug-resistant HIV-1 variants (not detectable by Sanger sequencing) under antiretroviral therapy pressure can lead to a shift in the viral quasispecies distribution, becoming dominant members of the virus population and eventually causing treatment failure. Here, we used a novel HIV-1 genotyping assay based on deep sequencing (DeepGen) to quantify low-level drug-resistant HIV-1 variants in 33 patients failing a first-line antiretroviral treatment regimen in the absence of drug-resistant mutations, as screened by standard population-based Sanger sequencing. Using this sensitive assay, we observed that 64% (21/33) of these individuals had low-frequency (or minority) drug-resistant variants in the intrapatient HIV-1 population, which correlated with treatment failure. Moreover, the presence of these minority HIV-1 variants was associated with higher intrapatient HIV-1 diversity, suggesting a dynamic selection or fading of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants from the viral quasispecies in the presence or absence of drug pressure, respectively. This study identified low-frequency HIV drug resistance mutations by deep sequencing in Ugandan patients failing antiretroviral treatment but lacking dominant drug resistance mutations as determined by Sanger sequencing methods. We showed that these low-abundance drug-resistant viruses could have significant consequences for clinical outcomes, especially if treatment is not modified based on a susceptible HIV-1 genotype by Sanger sequencing. Therefore, we propose to make clinical decisions using more sensitive methods to detect minority HIV-1 variants."
4439,0.001,1.0000,"Interleukin (IL)-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in both innate and adaptive immune responses against viruses and intracellular pathogens. Increased levels of circulating IL-18 from HIV-1 infected patients have been reported especially in the advanced and late stages of the disease, whereas in the initial stage serum levels of IL-18 were not increased. In contrast, low production of Il-18 was observed in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of HIV-1 infected patients, and these results were also observed in macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). In addition, decreased IL-18 production from PBMC was significantly correlated with low production of IL-2. Furthermore, serum levels of IL-18 significantly decreased after highly active antiretroviral therapy. During the early stage of HIV-1 infection there is a decreased production of gamma interferon (IFN), IL-12 and IL-2 as well as not activation of IL-18 production and this leads to inhibition of Th1 immune response, whereas in the advanced stage of the disease, strong activation of IL-18 production along with persistent decreased production of gamma IFN, IL-12 and IL-2 may promote a Th2 immune response, which leads to persistent viral replication. Several studies have shown increased levels of IL-18 in HIV-seronegative subjects with obesity, insulin resistance and type II diabetes. Metabolic disorders, fat redistribution and cardiovascular manifestations are becoming more frequent in HIV-1 infected patients treated with antiretroviral drugs. Consequently, involvement of IL-18 in these disorders has been postulated and demonstrated in patients with lipodistrophy, or with hypertriglyceridemia. Finally, higher serum levels of IL-18 may represent an useful marker in HIV-1 infected patients with metabolic disorders and fat redistribution, as well as a sensitive predictor of cardiovascular complications in treated patients."
4739,0.001,1.0000,"Development of a microbicide that prevents rectal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a vital component in reducing HIV spread. We recently demonstrated that a formulation of the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) MIV-150 in carrageenan reduced vaginal infection of macaques with simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239 with HIV-1(HxB2) reverse transcriptase (SHIV-RT). Herein, we performed the first testing of MIV-150-carrageenan against rectal infection. Rhesus macaques were treated rectally with MIV-150-carrageenan or methyl cellulose (MC) placebo gel up to 4 h prior to rectal challenge with 10³ or 10(4) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID₅₀) of SHIV-RT. Infection was assessed by measuring plasma virus RNA as well as T and B cell responses. MIV-150-carrageenan protected all animals challenged with 10³ TCID(₅₀ when gel was applied either 30 min or 4 h prior to challenge, while 100% of the MC-treated animals became infected (n = 4 each; P < 0.03). Partial protection (2 of 4 animals) by MIV-150-carrageenan was observed for rectal challenge with 10-fold more virus applied 4 h after the gel. Sequencing of the RT gene from plasma virus RNA isolated at peak viremia confirmed that both of these animals (like infected MC controls) were infected with wild-type virus. Infection correlated with the development of SIV-specific T and B cell responses. MIV-150 was detected in the rectal fluids and tissues 4 h after gel application but was not detected in the blood at any time (0.5 to 24 h). These data are promising for the development of NNRTI-containing gels to prevent rectal HIV transmission."

Forty-five children born of mothers with antibodies to HIV type 1 were studied; P24 antigen was measured in plasma, and HIV-1 proviral DNA was sought in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after amplification by PCR. In 26 cases, blood specimens were cultured for HIV; in all but two instances cultures were established at the same time that the PCR test was performed. Primer pairs in three regions of the proviral genome were used for the PCR test. There was good agreement between the results obtained from PCR tests and from cultures; of 24 children in whom both tests were done at the same time, 10 had positive results on both the culture and the PCR test, 1 had positive results on the PCR test but negative culture results, and 13 had negative results on both tests (concordance 96%). Measurement of p24 antigen in plasma was, in contrast, an insensitive marker of infection: 6 of 12 infants with positive cultures had positive p24 test results, and 8 of 18 infants had positive PCR test results. Sixteen children with subsequent seronegativity for HIV-1 had negative PCR results. This study provides further evidence that the PCR test is a valid alternative to viral culture for the diagnosis of pediatric HIV infection."
2039,0.001,1.0000,"Major T-cell receptor beta chain variable region (TCRBV) repertoire perturbations are temporally associated with the down-regulation of viremia during primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and with oligoclonal expansion and clonal exhaustion of HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). To determine whether initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during primary infection influences the dynamics of T-cell-mediated immune responses, the TCRBV repertoire was analyzed by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction in serial blood samples obtained from 11 untreated and 11 ART-treated patients. Repertoire variations were evaluated longitudinally. Stabilization of the TCRBV repertoire was more consistently observed in treated as compared with untreated patients. Furthermore, the extent and the rapidity of stabilization were significantly different in treated versus untreated patients. TCRBV repertoire stabilization was positively correlated with the slope of HIV viremia in the treated group, suggesting an association between repertoire stabilization and virologic response to treatment. To test whether stabilization was associated with variations in the clonal complexity of T-cell populations, T-cell receptor (TCR) heteroduplex mobility shift assays (HMAs) were performed on sequential samples from 4 HAART-treated subjects. Densitometric analysis of HMA profiles showed a reduction in the number of TCR clonotypes in most TCRBV families and a significant decrease in the total number of clonotypes following 7 months of HAART. Furthermore, a biphasic decline in HIV-specific but not heterologous CTL clones was observed. This indicates that ART leads to a global reduction of CD8(+) T-cell oligoclonality and significantly modulates the mobilization of HIV-specific CTL during primary infection.

1758,0.001,1.0000,"Our objective was to explore whether positive human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNAemia at baseline impaired CD4+ T-cell increase after 1 year of HAART. A sub-study of a randomized clinical trial in selected patients with <200 cell/mm CD4+ at baseline was conducted. Six out of 30 patients had detectable HCMV DNAemia at baseline, all reaching HCMV suppression at week 52 after HAART (only 1 of them was treated with valgancyclovir). No significant differences were found between patients with detectable or undetectable HCMV DNAemia in terms of CD4+ T-cell increase and HIV RNA response to HAART. Although some data may favor HCVM pre-emptive therapy to decrease immune activation, our results do not indicate that this practice may increase CD4+ T-cell count after HAART. At the same time, HAART proved effective in reducing HCMV DNAemia without the need for a specific therapy."

To determine the incidence of paradoxical responses in patients with AIDS and TB who are treated with antituberculous therapy and subsequently with combination antiretroviral therapy (ARV), we conducted a prospective study of 33 HIV-seropositive TB patients treated with anti-TB therapy and antiretroviral therapy (Group 1) compared with 55 HIV-seronegative TB patients treated with anti-TB therapy (Group 2) and 28 HIV-seropositive TB patients treated with anti-TB therapy but not on antiretrovirals (historical control; Group 3). In Group 1 patients, paradoxical responses were temporally more related to the initiation of ARV than to the initiation of anti-TB therapy (mean +/- SD: 15 +/- 11 d versus 109 +/- 72 d [p < 0.001]) and occurred much more frequently (12 of 33; 36%) compared with Group 2 (1 of 55; 2%) (p < 0.001) or with Group 3 (2 of 28; 7%) (p = 0.013). The majority of patients who experienced paradoxical responses and received tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) in Group 1 had their tuberculin skin tests convert from negative to strongly positive after ARV. These observations suggest that a paradoxical response associated with enhanced tuberculin skin reactivity may occur after the initiation of ARV in HIV-infected TB patients. Furthermore, the skin test conversion after the initiation of ARV may have important public health implications."
6620,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus polymerase (HBV Pol) is an important target for anti-HBV drug development; however, its low solubility and stability in vitro has hindered detailed structural studies. Certain nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NRTIs) such as tenofovir and lamivudine can inhibit both HBV Pol and Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) RT, leading to speculation on structural and mechanistic analogies between the deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP)-binding sites of these enzymes. The Q151M mutation in HIV-1 RT, located at the dNTP-binding site, confers resistance to various NRTIs, while maintaining sensitivity to tenofovir and lamivudine. The residue corresponding to Gln151 is strictly conserved as a methionine in HBV Pol. Therefore, the structure of the dNTP-binding pocket of the HIV-1 RT Q151M mutant may reflect that of HBV Pol. Here, the crystal structure of HIV-1 RT Q151M, determined at 2.6 Å resolution, in a new crystal form with space group P321 is presented. Although the structure of HIV-1 RT Q151M superimposes well onto that of HIV-1 RT in a closed conformation, a slight movement of the β-strands (β2-β3) that partially create the dNTP-binding pocket was observed. This movement might be caused by the introduction of the bulky thioether group of Met151. The structure also highlighted the possibility that the hydrogen-bonding network among amino acids and NRTIs is rearranged by the Q151M mutation, leading to a difference in the affinity of NRTIs for HIV-1 RT and HBV Pol."
5732,0.001,1.0000,"Vicriviroc (VCV) is a small-molecule CCR5 coreceptor antagonist currently in clinical trials for treatment of R5-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. With this drug in development, identification of resistance mechanisms to VCV is needed to allow optimal outcomes in clinical practice. In this study we further characterized VCV resistance in a lab-adapted, VCV-resistant RU570 virus (RU570-VCV(res)). We show that K305R, R315Q, and K319T amino acid changes in the V3 loop, along with P437S in C4, completely reproduced the resistance phenotype in a chimeric ADA envelope containing the C2-V5 region from RU570 passage control gp120. The K305R amino acid change primarily impacted the degree of resistance, whereas K319T contributed to both resistance and virus infectivity. The P437S mutation in C4 had more influence on the relative degree of virus infectivity, while the R315Q mutation contributed to the virus concentration-dependent phenotypic resistance pattern observed for RU570-VCV(res). RU570-VCV(res) pseudovirus entry with VCV-bound CCR5 was dramatically reduced by Y10A, D11A, Y14A, and Y15A mutations in the N terminus of CCR5, whereas these mutations had less impact on entry in the absence of VCV. Notably, an additional Q315E/I317F substitution in the crown region of the V3 loop enhanced resistance to VCV, resulting in a stronger dependence on the N terminus for viral entry. By fitting the envelope mutations to a molecular model of a recently described docked N-terminal CCR5 peptide consisting of residues 2 to 15 in complex with HIV-1 gp120 CD4, potential new interactions in gp120 with the N terminus of CCR5 were uncovered. The cumulative results of this study suggest that as the RU570 VCV-resistant virus adapted to use the drug-bound receptor, it also developed an increased reliance on the N terminus of CCR5."
2802,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection occurs worldwide but is most prevalent in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa with reported prevalence rates varying from 3 - 26 %. The higher prevalence of infection has been reported in patients with HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. Hepatitis B virus not only affects the liver but has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of membranous, membranoproliferative and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritides. Though controlling the spread of HBV infection in renal dialysis units has been one of the major triumphs in the management of end-stage renal disease, transmission of HBV can still occur through contamination of equipments and environmental surfaces and the use of multiple dose vials of drugs. Some reports have indicated that prior HBV infections have negative impact on graft and host survival following transplantation. Interferon can be used in the treatment of HBV-associated glomerulonephritides (HBV- GN) but is contraindicated in transplantation because of its immuno-modulatory effects. Despite the fact that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have suboptimal response to HBV immunization, immunization is still beneficial to these patients. However, reports indicate that most patients with CKD were either not immunized or were given suboptimal doses. Control of HBV in the population by immunization can lead to a reduction in the prevalence of HBV- GN. In addition, immunization of patients with CKD will help in controlling HBV infection in dialysis settings and can lead to improved graft and host survival following transplantation."
5563,0.001,1.0000,"The progress in treatment against hepatitis B virus (HBV) has substantially improved the outcome of all HBV-infected patients. We systematically reviewed the existing data in the management of HBV transplant patients in order to assess the optimal regimen in the pretransplant setting, for post-transplant prophylaxis and for therapy of HBV recurrent infection. All data suggest that an effective pretransplant anti-HBV therapy prevents post-transplant HBV recurrence. Pretransplant therapy has been based on lamivudine with addition of adefovir upon lamivudine resistance, but the use of newer, potent high-genetic barrier agents is expected to improve long-term efficacy. Moreover, it may lead to improvement of liver function, which sometimes removes the need for transplantation, although more objective criteria for removal from waiting lists are required. After liver transplantation, the combination of HBV immunoglobulin and one nucleos(t)ide analogue, mostly lamivudine, is currently the best approach, almost eliminating the probability of HBV recurrence. Treatment of post-transplant HBV recurrence has been mainly studied with lamivudine, but it will be most effective with entecavir and tenofovir, which have a low risk of resistance. In conclusion, the newer anti-HBV agents improve the treatment of HBV both pretransplant and post-transplant. HBV immunoglobulin is still used in combination with an anti-HBV agent for post-transplant prophylaxis. Monoprophylaxis with one of the new anti-HBV agents might be possible, particularly in patients preselected as having a low risk of HBV recurrence, but further data are needed and strategies to ensure compliance must be used."

We aimed to describe the epidemiological, virological and clinical characteristics of HBV infections newly diagnosed in 2011 in University hospitals of Marseille, the second largest French city. HBV serology was performed for 18,130 sera from 15,744 patients. A total of 167 patients were newly-diagnosed with HBV based upon the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis B core antibodies. Clinico-epidemiological features were analyzed for 78 patients. Patients included a majority of men (59%), women being significantly younger with a mean age of 36 ± 17 versus 43.5 ± 16.2 years (P = 0.009). Country of birth was available for 52 patients and 35% of them originated from sub-Saharan Africa. Levels of the liver biological parameters were significantly lower in women compared to men, in whom mean alanine aminotransferase and gammaglutamyl transferase levels were 24 ± 39 versus 37 ± 36 IU/l (P = 0.0001) and 20 ± 20 versus 51 ± 53 IU/l (P = 0.0001), respectively. Co-infections with hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency viruses were found in 5% and 6% of the patients, respectively. HBV DNA was detectable in 90% of the HBeAg-negative patients. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the HBsAg titer and the HBV DNA level (P = 0.001). Genotype D was the most common HBV genotype and was found in 53% of the patients tested, followed by genotype E (21%). HBV remains a major concern with a slightly greater number of new diagnoses than in 2004. HBV genetic diversity was substantial in the present cohort."
8375,0.001,1.0000,"The authors report four arterial aneurysms seen in three patients infected by HIV. The aneurysms affected: 1) the left common carotid artery in a young man HIV carrier, 2) the right common carotid artery and the abdominal aorta in a woman with AIDS, 3) the right common carotid artery in a patient with AIDS-related complex. The aetiology was found to be infectious, respectively: 1) staphylococcus epidermidis (certain), 2) tuberculosis or another undetected infection (possible), 3) staphylococcus epidermidis or syphilis (highly probable). A viral arteritis mechanism is also postulated in the second case. If this association of aneurysms with HIV infection is not fortuitous, an increase of aneurysm incidence in HIV infected population is to be expected."
1784,0.001,1.0000,"The coexistence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is unusual, but the occurrence of SLE after HIV infection is even less common. Both conditions share similar clinical features including constitutional symptoms, facial rash, oral ulcers, alopecia, arthralgias, arthritis, seizures, cytopenias, glomerulonephritis, and antinuclear and antiphospholipid antibodies. This clinical overlap makes the diagnosis of SLE in a patient with pre-existing HIV infection difficult. Furthermore, immune complex glomerulonephritis with features resembling lupus nephritis has been described in HIV-positive patients. We present the case of a 45-year-old Hispanic woman with long-standing HIV infection who developed membranous glomerulonephritis with histological features of lupus nephritis. Five years after onset of renal disease she developed clinically evident SLE."
2893,0.001,1.0000,"Over a 15-year period, a white American woman was observed to have progressive hepatitis B that underwent hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) positivity to anti-HBe positivity with development of cirrhosis. This patient was found to have a non-sense mutation in the second codon of the pre-C region of the hepatitis B virus genome after her anti-HBe seroconversion but not in her serum when she was HBeAg+. As controls, serial blood specimens were analyzed from 12 other American patients who spontaneously converted from HBeAg to anti-HBe, who underwent an interferon alfa-associated HBeAg to anti-HBe seroconversion, and who did not seroconvert with interferon alfa therapy. No mutations in the pre-C region were observed to arise in these individuals. In conclusion, non-sense mutations that occur in the pre-C region in locations other than the 28th codon can be associated with HBeAg negative progressive liver disease. This report of a non-sense mutation occurring over time is unusual in that it occurred in a white American patient."
3484,0.001,1.0000,"The development of an unusual case of primary pleural effusion in a 90-year-old human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative Japanese woman with no identifiable tumor mass has been described. Pleural effusion specimens contained large diffuse lymphoma cells, with the phenotype and genotype of a B-cell lineage (positive for CD20, CD79a and clonal rearrangement of Ig heavy chain) and the c-myc gene rearrangement, but were negative for T-cell markers (CD45RO and CD3). The patient was negative for human herpes virus 8 (HHV8), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1). The patient died of respiratory failure 5 months after the diagnosis of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and an autopsy was performed. Autopsy findings revealed no evidence of tumor mass or bone marrow involvement of lymphoma cells. This case has been considered as a PEL in a HIV-, HHV8-, EBV- and HCV-negative patient. Although cytomorphology of lymphoma cells was classified as large-cell lymphoma in this case, it is interesting that the present case may represent an unusual subset of Burkitt-like disease because of clear B-cell phenotype and c-myc gene rearrangement."
1726,0.001,1.0000,"Reactivation of latent JC virus in immunodeficient subjects can lead to a demyelinating disease following lytic oligodendrocyte infection. It is known as idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia and rarely occurs in immunosuppressed patients who are not infected by HIV. We describe a case of persistent idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia in an HIV-negative 65-year-old woman. At autopsy, polymerase chain reaction analysis evidenced JC virus DNA in kidney, brain and liver although there were no signs of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or evidence of oligodendrocyte infection. While her disease was not HIV-induced, it closely resembled AIDS in terms of the nature of the immune derangement and the clinical picture. The case also evidences the reactivation of JC virus infection in non-HIV-related immunosuppression in cerebral and/or extracerebral sites: liver infection seems to be particularly relevant since it has not yet been recognized as a common target of JC virus infection or a source of virus spreading. The absence of any sign of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was remarkable: histological examination failed to disclose demyelination or other progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy changes, and the search for JC virus DNA with in situ methods also gave negative results. The lack of lytic brain infection in this case would seem to support the hypothesis that the expression of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is directly dependent on the presence of HIV infection."

Erythema nodosum, periphlebitis, erythematous papulopustular lesions, half and half nails, ocular congestion, raised ESR and dimorphic anemia were some other features present.

2577,0.001,1.0000,"As a result of the potent drug combinations of reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors currently available, it is now possible to achieve extreme reductions in the numbers of viral particles in the peripheral blood of HIV-positive patients undergoing treatment, to the point that they are undetectable. Moreover, the immunological recovery resulting from continued and prolonged use of these drugs significantly reduces both mortality and the incidence of opportunistic infections. However, the strict therapeutic regimens required, the number of pills, adverse events and the stigma of a disease that requires the patient to introduce pill-taking into his/her lifestyle brings into question one aspect of mental health, which is motivation to do that which is being proposed. We investigated the influence of each of the components of the adherence trilogy: information, motivation and behavioral abilities, as risk factors in a population of HIV-positive/AIDS patients undergoing antiretroviral treatment in the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil."
3760,0.001,1.0000,"Liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease is complicated by HBV recurrence and, consequently, poor patient and graft survival. Patients transplanted for hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-related cirrhosis are reported to have a diminished incidence of HBV recurrence and improved graft survival. However, only a few reported HDV-infected patients had active HBV replicative disease before liver transplantation. In our experience, we transplanted two HDV-infected patients, both of whom had active HBV replication before liver transplantation. In one patient, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) recurred four months after transplantation. Two months later, Hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) and HBV-DNA became positive, and the patient died of fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. In the other patient, HBV persisted after transplantation, and 2 months later the patient required retransplantation for fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. With the second graft, the patient remained free of HBV infection for 1 year. Thereafter, the patient experienced HBV recurrence with active replication and died of fulminant hepatitis B and delta recurrence. In the first case and in the second graft of the second case, hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) immunoprophylaxis was administered in an attempt to prevent recurrence of HBV. The literature suggests that an HDV infection inhibits the replication of HBV and therefore plays a role in preventing the recurrence of HBV and improving survival. Our experience with two patients suggests that HDV infection, in the presence of active HBV replication, may not play a protective role."
9606,0.001,1.0000,"Of all the hepatotropic viruses, HBV is associated with the greatest worldwide morbidity and mortality. This is because of the ease of transmission and the potential for progression to a chronic infective carrier state, with the complications of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The use of PCR has shown that some of the earlier concepts concerning the interpretation of serological data were inaccurate. Many patients with anti-HBe and anti-HBs have viral DNA detectable by PCR, and some hepatocellular carcinoma patients have detectable HBV DNA in their livers in the absence of all serological markers of HBV disease. The clearance of HBV infected cells from the liver is dependent on the interplay between the interferon system and the cellular limb of the host immune response. The importance of the nucleocapsid proteins as targets for sensitized cytotoxic T cells has been established for chronic HBV infection. The importance of pre-S sequences as inducers and targets of the virus-neutralizing humoral immune response is becoming established, but their precise role must await the development of in vitro models of hepadnavirus infection and a greater understanding of the mechanisms of viral uptake. The epidemiology and clinical course of the disease can be modified by immunization, immune stimulation and antiviral chemotherapy. For the developing world, a programme of immunization at birth would be the most effective way of eliminating this disease, but at present the cost is prohibitive. For the developed world, immunization is realistic for the at-risk population, and anti-viral and immunostimulatory therapy available for those already infected. In adult acquired chronic HBV infection alpha-interferon produces HBe antigen clearance in 40-60% of cases and is followed by resolution of the hepatic inflammation. Results in neonatally acquired infection are less impressive and prednisolone priming followed by interferon may be needed. The presence of a mutation in the pre-core region of some virus isolates has recently been described. Hepatocytes infected with this virus cannot produce HBe antigen and the course of the liver disease is fairly rapid. Whether this mutant causes liver damage in the same way as the wild virus or is directly cytopathic remains unclear, and its relationship to fulminant hepatitis is under investigation."

The objective of this study was to assess temporal trends, epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics of primary HIV infections. A retrospective analysis of 79 patients presenting primary HIV infections from 2005 to 2012 was performed in Marseille University Hospitals, southeastern France. Clinical, epidemiological and immunovirological data including phylogeny based on the polymerase gene were collected. 65 males and 14 females were enrolled. The main transmission route was homosexual contact (60.8%). Patients were mostly infected with subtype B (73.4%) and CRF02_AG (21.5%) HIV-1 strains. An increase in the annual number of HIV seroconversions among new HIV diagnoses from 5% in 2005 to 11.2% in 2012 (P = 0.06) and of the proportion of CRF02_AG HIV strains among primary HIV infections in 2011-2012 as compared to 2005-2010 (P = 0.055) was observed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four transmission clusters including three transmission clusters among men having sex with men: two large clusters of nine CRF02_AG, six B HIV strains; and one small cluster of three B HIV strains. Clusters involved more frequently men (P = 0.01) belonging to caucasian ethicity (P = 0.05), with a higher HIV RNA load at inclusion (P = 0.03). These data highlight the importance of improving epidemiological surveillance and of implementing suitable prevention strategies to control the spread of HIV transmission among men having sex with men."

An association between AITD and infections with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), in combination with the effects of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), has been suggested by several research groups. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the frequency of thyroid dysfunction and AITD in women > 35 years of age infected with HIV, and to identify factors associated with the emergence of these thyroid abnormalities. HIV-infected women (n = 153) selected from the infectious disease outpatient clinic at a University Hospital in Rio de Janeiro were characterized based on their circulating CD4+ lymphocytes levels, viral loads, serum TSH levels, and the presence of FT4 and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab). A total of 129 participants were on HAART and 24 were not. The frequency of thyroid disorders was 7.8% (12/153 patients) and all were on HAART at the time of diagnosis, yielding a prevalence of 9.3% in patients receiving HAART compared with 0% in patients not on HAART. AITD, hyper, and hypothyroidism were detected in 4.6%, 3.1%, and 4.1% of HAART patients. It was not detected any thyroid dysfunction or autoimmunity in HIV-infected women not on HAART. This study demonstrated an association between HAART and the development of AITD. In addition AITD only developed in HAART patients also presenting with undetectable viral loads and slightly elevated CD4+ T cell counts. "
1476,0.001,1.0000,"In the early 1990s, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection associated with possible reuse of syringes and needles was reported among children in Romanian orphanages. These findings led health-care workers to use new disposable syringes and needles for administering injections. Bythe late 1990s, reports suggested that new disposable syringes and needles had become standard for all injections. However, surveillance data collected by the Romanian Ministry of Health (MoH) during 1997-1998 indicated that acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was associated with receiving injections among children aged <5 years. In Romania, injection frequently is used to administer medication, and nurses administer most injections. To identify the practices that might have resulted in injection-associated HBV transmission, selected clinic and hospital nurses were surveyed. This report summarizes the findings of the survey, which indicated that although nurses used new disposable syringes and needles, other inadequate infection-control practices might explain injection-associated HBV transmission. Results of the survey were used by the Romanian Coalition to Prevent Nosocomial Infections to prepare standards for injection safety to protect patients and health-care workers from HBV infection."
418,0.001,1.0000,"Since there are more than 150 000 Italians (about 25 for every 10,000 inhabitants) infected with HIV, Intensive Care Units (ICU) often come across patients who are HIV positive. The aim of this study was to provide current information on the epidemiology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients admitted to ICU during the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and to review issues related to the administration of antiretroviral therapy relevant to the ICU staff. Overall mortality of critically ill HIV-infected patients in ICUs has decreased in the HAART era, and patients are more often admitted with non-HIV-related illnesses. Use of HAART in the ICU is difficult; however it may be associated with improved outcomes. More HIV-infected patients survive ICU admission and are less likely to be admitted to the ICU for related infections; in most cases, they need critical care for problems unrelated to HIV infection or for conditions related to HAART toxicity. ICU staff need to be familiar with HAART for the following reasons: 1) to recognize life-threatening toxicities unique to these drugs; 2) to avoid drug interactions, which are extremely common and potentially life-threatening; and 3) to avoid enhancing HIV drug resistance, an occurrence that could have devastating consequences for the patient after discharge from the ICU."
6266,0.001,1.0000,"INTRODUCTION. High activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has allowed people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to live longer. In the course of time, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) began to be found in these patients. Investigations have suggested that, as it has been described for other tumors, HIV infection raises the risk of developing HCC. However, convincing evidence is still required. Our aim was to quantify the incidence of HCC in hepatitis C cirrhotic patients with and without human immunodeficiency virus infection in the HAART era. MATERIAL AND METHOds. This prospective cohort study was conducted in hepatitis C cirrhotic patients with and without HIV co-infection, between june 1, 1999 and May 21, 2010. Ultrasound screening for HCC was performed every 6 to 12 months to all the patients until January 15, 2011. Incidence rate and cumulative incidence (Kaplan-Meier) were calculated. RESULTS. One hundred and forty eight patients (69 hepatitis C virus mono-infected and 79 HIV/hepatitis C virus co-infected) were followed for a median time of 43 months, with a total follow-up of 555 person-years (324 for co-infected and 231 for mono-infected patients). Twelve patients developed HCC (5 co-infected and 7 mono-infected). The incidence of HCC in co-infected patients and mono-infected patients was 1.54 (95% confidence interval = 0.5 to 3.6) and 3.03 (95% confidence interval = 1.22 to 6.23) cases per 100 person-year respectively (log-rank p = 0.3225). CONCLUSION. In the HAART era, HIV co-infection is not associated with a higher incidence of HCC in hepatitis C cirrhotic patients."
4721,0.001,1.0000,"Intestinal microsporidiosis is most commonly associated with persistent diarrhea in advanced AIDS cases. To determine the prevalence and clinical manifestations of this infection in HIV/AIDS patients, a single fresh stool sample and blood were collected from 243 (214 HIV-positive and 29 HIV-negative) diarrheal patients. The presence of intestinal microsporidiosis in the stool was determined by Uvitex-2B staining and a PCR-based detection method. HIV screening was done by using ELISA, and reactive samples were confirmed by Western blotting. The CD4+ cell count was analyzed using FACScan. Out of 243 diarrheal patients, 39 (16.0%) cases were positive for intestinal microsporidial infection by either of the methods used. Of the 39, only 18 cases positive by microscopy were also positive by PCR. Based on PCR and microscopic analyses the microsporidial parasites were identified as Enterocytozoon bieneusi (30), Ecephalitozoon intestinalis (6), and double infections (3). All microsporidia-positive cases were HIV-positive, and 92.3% had diarrhea for over 4 weeks. The diarrhea was watery in 79.5% of the patients. Weight loss >10% was recorded in 37 (94.9%) cases. The CD4+ cell count was <100 cells/mm(3) in 84.4% of subjects, and 59.4% of the patients had a CD4+ cell count of < or =50 cells/mm(3), with a mean of 22.8 cells/mm(3). This study revealed that intestinal microsporidiosis is a common cause of chronic diarrhea and severe weight loss in advanced AIDS patients in Ethiopia. This condition is attributable mainly to E. bieneusi. Thus, early diagnosis of intestinal microsporidiosis in HIV/AIDS patients would certainly be helpful in the understanding and management of diarrheal illness."
2819,0.001,1.0000,"In many resource-limited regions with endemic hepatitis B virus (HBV), there is limited infrastructure to collect, process, transport, and store blood samples for identification of persons with chronic HBV infection or with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We describe the application of a simple technique using commercially available kits for detection of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) in dried blood spots (DBS) collected on filter paper. Study participants included subjects with and without chronic HBV infection and subjects with HCC or cirrhosis. Three to five blood drops were dried on filter paper. Dried blood (equivalent to 20 muL) was eluted and tested for HBsAg by Determine(TM) HBsAg and for AFP by counter-current immuno-electrophoresis and radio-immunoassay (RIA). The primary analysis focused on comparison of DBS results to serum testing results as the gold standard. The sensitivity of DBS for detecting chronic HBV infection was 96% (98-98) with specificity of 100% (CI 99-100). Sensitivity of DBS in detecting AFP compared with serum RIA was 73% (60-86) with specificity of 90% (81-98). Both HBsAg and AFP recovery were unaffected when DBS were left at room temperature (30-33 degrees C) and under humid conditions for up to 28 days prior to elution. We conclude that DBS can be reliably used as an economical and logical alternative for detection of HBsAg in chronically infected patients and for AFP-based diagnosis of HCC in clinical situations which preclude adequate collection and processing of blood samples. Both research-oriented field studies and routine clinical care may benefit from application of these techniques in resource-limited settings."

To search for possible sources of HIV in saliva, and using the polymerase chain-reaction technique, we sought the presence and shedding patterns of proviral HIV-1 DNA in gingival crevicular fluid in a group of patients previously determined as HIV-1-seropositive. Periodontal status at the collection sites was monitored by several clinical parameters, including Plaque Index, Gingival Index, probing depth, and clinical attachment loss. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected by means of paper points. Proviral HIV-1 DNA was detected in the gingival fluid of 17 out of 35 HIV-1-infected patients. Its detection correlated significantly with higher plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (p = 0.03) and not with peripheral blood CD4+ cell count, the presence of blood in gingival fluid, or oral lesions. There was a significant correlation between clinical attachment loss at the sites of fluid collection and plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (p = 0.002), and borderline correlation between the latter and probing depth (p = 0.54) in the group of patients harboring proviral HIV-1 DNA in gingival crevicular fluid. The results of our study suggest that mononuclear cells present in gingival crevicular fluid and harboring proviral HIV-1 DNA could represent a potential source of HIV-1 in the presence or absence of local bleeding, especially in persons with advanced HIV infection and increased loss of clinical attachment."
6698,0.001,1.0000,"Although highly active antiretroviral therapy against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 reduces the mortality of persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, it does not eliminate HIV reservoirs. In this study, which used a 6-thioguanine (6-TG) resistant clone (4C6) of the MT-2 cell line as a model, the combination of 6-TG with both reverse-transcriptase (RT) inhibitor and protease inhibitor or 6-TG with a protease inhibitor alone completely eradicated HIV-1-carrying cells from the culture and protected uninfected 4C6 cells from HIV-1 infection. The combination of 6-TG and a RT inhibitor, azidothymidine, provided partial protection. Protection was extended to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results suggest that adding a cytotoxic drug in combination antiviral chemotherapy may reduce the establishment of virus reservoirs and prevent virus spread. The clinical value of this and similar strategies should be further evaluated in HIV-infected patients."
307,0.001,1.0000,"In this observational single-center cohort study outside the clinical trial setting, outcome and predictors of virologic failure of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) containing a protease inhibitor were evaluated in human immunodeficiency (HIV)-infected persons. The study population consisted of 807 protease inhibitor-naive HIV-seropositive patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy with reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors (indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir) between January 1997 and January 1999. Demographic variable, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+ T-cell count, adverse drug reactions, and adherence to HAART were assessed. Virologic treatment response was defined as a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA load from baseline to below 500 copies per milliliter after 12 months of therapy. Levels of HIV-1 RNA were undetectable in 43% of patients at 12 months. Factors associated with failure to suppress viral load included age 40 years or younger, baseline CD4+ T cell count less than 200 x 10(6) per liter baseline viral load greater than 4.3 log(10) per milliliter, and non-adherence to HAART. After adjustment by logistic regression, non-adherence was the only statistically significant variable associated with virologic failure (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.67). Unselected patients in whom protease inhibitor is started in a usual clinical setting achieve viral suppression less frequently than do patients in controlled clinical trials. Failure to adherence to HAART was the strongest predictor of virologic failure."
2116,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by a progressive impairment in immunocompetence leading to severe opportunistic infections and malignancies. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the potential impact of immunomodulation by oral ranitidine, 600 mg daily, for 28 days was studied in 18 HIV-positive patients (CDC group II). All were without clinical signs of infections and were not treated with other known immunomodulating agents. Several immunological parameters related to HIV infection were studied and confirmed to be impaired early in HIV infection. Spontaneous and in vitro interleukin-2- and interferon-alpha-stimulated natural killer cell activity improved in the ranitidine-treated patients in contrast to a decrease in nontreated patients (#p less than 0.03, #p less than 0.01, #p less than 0.02 between groups, respectively). Furthermore, T-cell blastogenesis to phytohemagglutinin stimulation and soluble interleukin-2 receptors in serum increased in ranitidine-treated patients compared with nontreated patients (#p less than 0.01). However, ranitidine treatment did not change CD4+ cell counts. Although the significant improvement in immunocompetence shown in this study is small, the present result indicates the need for further trials with immunomodulation by ranitidine in HIV-infected individuals."
34,0.001,1.0000,"This article critically discusses the nursing care and management of a person living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as a long-term condition, requiring highly complex HIV care. Complex HIV care is managed in the secondary care setting. However, recent legislation has motivated shifts in HIV care to the community care setting. This article aims to enhance health professionals' understanding in order to equip practice and district nurses to deliver HIV care provision. Antiretroviral adherence is a prerequisite for disease survival as well as an essential component of complete HIV self-care management. It is therefore imperative that nurses tailor adherence strategies according to each patient's requirements. Case management strategies such as the use of cognitive behavioural therapy to alleviate depressive symptoms will be considered. Furthermore, the use of motivational interviewing for antiretroviral adherence is highlighted as a potential intervention to help patients overcome the physical, psychological and physiological challenges of living with HIV-associated comorbidities. The delivery of integrated HIV care is pivotal for the management of the person living with HIV, as is the facilitation of a self-caring behaviour. "
1383,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection during pregnancy is a condition that requires multidisciplinary care. Care must be rendered that is appropriate for both the mother and the fetus. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is of paramount concern. To prevent transmission, universal testing for HIV infection in pregnant women is ideal. In the United States and other developed countries, great strides have been made toward decreasing the risk of HIV transmission to infants to <2% with use of a combination of highly active antiretroviral therapy during the antepartum period and during labor and delivery, scheduled cesarean section when appropriate, avoidance of breast-feeding, and 6 weeks of zidovudine prophylaxis for infants. The continuation of antiretroviral therapy after delivery depends on the needs of the mother with regard to treatment of her own health. In resource-limited countries, where simplified and shortened courses of antiretroviral regimens have been used, reduction in mother-to-child transmission has also been shown, although not as effectively as that with highly active antiretroviral therapy. In these settings, exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months is recommended to reduce the risk of postnatal transmission."

Although prospective studies indicate that the estimated risk for HIV infection after a percutaneous exposure to HIV-infected blood is approximately 0.3% (1,2), factors that influence this risk have not been determined. To assess potential risk factors, CDC, in collaboration with French and British public health authorities, conducted a retrospective case-control study using data reported to national surveillance systems in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. This report describes the study and summarizes results that suggest that risk factors for HIV transmission include certain characteristics of the exposure and the source patient; in addition, postexposure use of zidovudine (ZDV) by HCWs was associated with a lower risk for HIV transmission."
4340,0.001,1.0000,"Women in developing countries often present for medical care with advanced cervical cancer, although this condition is preventable through regular screening and early treatment. This study sought to identify the prevalence and risk factors for cervical dyskaryosis among women in Zimbabwe with and without HIV. In a cross-sectional study, 200 consenting women were screened for cervical dyskaryosis and sexually transmitted infections (STI). The relationship between various risk factors for cervical dyskaryosis was examined. The overall prevalence of cervical dyskaryosis was high (19%), and significantly higher among HIV-infected women at 30% compared with 13% among seronegative women, with a peak at a younger age among seropositive women. Use of intravaginal herbs, practising intravaginal cleansing, being single, a history of three or more lifetime sexual partners and a history of previous STI were associated with cervical dysplasia. The high frequency of cervical abnormality lends weight to the demand for implementation of regular screening programmes and health education."
1083,0.001,1.0000,"Although therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection has delivered remarkable cure rates, curative therapies for hepatitis B virus (HBV) may only be available in the distant future. The possibility to eliminate or at least stably maintain low levels of HBV replication under the control of a functional anti-host response has stimulated the development of specific immunotherapies for HBV infection. We reviewed the development of T-cell therapy for HBV, highlighting its potential antiviral efficiency but also its potential toxicities in different groups of chronic HBV patients. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are the only two communicable diseases in which there have been increases in related morbidity and mortality over the past 20 years [1]. Both viruses are chronically infecting about 500 million people (HBV ~350 million, HCV ~150 million) and represent the seventh most frequent cause of death worldwide [1]. HBV and HCV are hepatotropic, non-cytopathic viruses able to establish persistent infections that cause different degrees of hepatic inflammation (chronic hepatitis), leading to the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The two viruses are unrelated and virologically different. HCV remains prevalent in North America and Europe, whereas chronic hepatitis B is prevalent in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [1,2]. HCV is an RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, and HBV is a DNA virus of the Hepadnaviridae family and uses reverse transcriptase to synthesize its DNA from a pre-genomic RNA form [3]. HCV is able to activate in the infected host a classical type I interferon (IFN)-mediated innate response [3], whereas HBV generally escapes innate immune recognition and does not activate type I IFN-mediated immunity. Chronic HBV and HCV infections are both characterized by quantitative and functional defects of virus-specific T-cell response [4,5]. The frequency of virus-specific T cells is extremely low, and virus-specific T cells show features of exhaustion in both chronic HBV and HCV patients [6]. However, the quantitative and functional defects are more pronounced in HBV infections, with T cells virtually undetectable in the blood of many chronic HBV patients by ex vivo analysis [7-9]. In addition, while frequency and impact of viral mutations in T cell epitopes are frequently detectable in HCV infections [10], viral mutations affecting CD8 T-cell epitopes are scarcer in chronic HBV patients [6,11,12]. Of extreme practical importance in relation to the potential impact of T-cell therapy for HBV and HCV are the efficacies of currently available treatments. New therapies for HCV have delivered remarkable cure rates, with more than 90% of patients achieving viral clearance with all oral direct-acting antivirals [13]. In contrast, curative therapies for HBV will not be available until the distant future (14). Thus, although it is difficult to see a possible therapeutic advantage of a new T-cell-based therapy in chronic HCV patients, the fact that current therapies for HBV only partially suppress but do not eliminate HBV from the infected host has encouraged research for new and more radical therapies designed to eliminate or at least stably maintain low levels of HBV replication under the control of a functional anti-host response. For these reasons, in this review, we concentrate on the development of T-cell therapy for HBV. T-cell therapy for HCV chronic infection is certainly important for understanding the mechanisms of T-cell antiviral control [15,16], but their use for therapy appears unlikely."
4764,0.001,1.0000,"Depression is the most common psychiatric co-morbidity among people living with HIV (PLHIV), with prevalence rates ranging from 25% to 36%. Depression impacts negatively upon adherence and response to combined antiretroviral therapy (CART) and the transmission of HIV infection through increased sexually risky behavior. This cross-sectional study presents data from a reference HIV-outpatient service in Dourados (Brazil) that evaluated the association between depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, and clinical, socioeconomic, and demographic factors in newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS patients. Using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 61% with a predominance of self-deprecating and cognitive-affective factors. Depressive symptoms were associated with lower income (p=0.019) and disadvantaged social class (p=0.005). Poorer quality of life was related to depressive symptoms (p<0.0001), low educational level (p=0.05), and lower income (p=0.03). These data suggest that socioeconomic factors, including level of income and education, are mediating the risk of depression and poor quality of life of PLHIV. Possible explanations for this effect are discussed, including the possible role of stigma."

A survey was conducted with a sample of patients attending an HIV outpatient clinic at San Francisco General Hospital to assess the prevalence of cigarette smoking and the level of interest in quitting. In total, 228 assessments were completed. Study results revealed a high percentage of smokers among our sample of individuals living with HIV compared to the percentage of smokers found in the general adult population. A total of 123 individuals (54%) reported that they smoked cigarettes. Men were more than twice as likely to have made previous attempts at smoking cessation than were woman. The majority of cigarette smokers (63%) reported that they were currently thinking about quitting. Respondents' preferences for types of smoking cessation methods are discussed, and recommendations are proposed for identifying and treating tobacco dependence in this population."
1334,0.001,1.0000,"Little is known about factors involved in virological response to treatment changes guided by genotyping in patients whose highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) fails. A 12-month observational study was conducted of 45 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, who underwent a new genotype-guided HAART regimen following virological treatment failure. Logistic regression models were used to define factors predictive of virological response to genotype-assisted treatment switches. Virological response was defined as achievement of a level of plasma HIV-1 RNA <1000 copies/mL at the end of the follow-up. Drug-resistance mutations were detected at baseline in 30 patients (66.7%). A sustained virological response to new treatment occurred in 13 (43.3%) of these, as opposed to 11 (73.3%) of the 15 patients harboring drug-susceptible virus at baseline (P=.07). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the number of drug classes where there was resistance at baseline was the only independent predictor of virological failure (P=.0313). Lack of virological response to genotype-guided treatment changes is primarily due to complex baseline resistance patterns. Benefits of antiretroviral resistance testing may be seriously limited by the lack of subsequent treatment options for heavily pretreated patients."

We searched for HCV antibodies by a third-generation ELISA technique, followed by a confirmation test (RIBA III); serum viral RNA and HCV genotype were investigated by a RT-PCR technique. We screened a total of 315 patients suffering from B-NHL (91), multiple myeloma (56), MGUS (48), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (57), Waldentrom's macroglobulinemia (13), Hodgkin's disease (HD)(43), and T-NHL (9). While only 1 of 52 patients with a non-B-LPD (HD or T-NHL) had signs of HCV contact (i.e., 1.9%, which is in the range of the normal population in the South of Italy), 59 of 263 patients with a B-LPD (22.4%) had HCV antibodies or RNA, or both, with no major differences among the various types of disorders, except for WM, in which the rate was higher (61.5%). The same prevalence was found for patients tested at diagnosis or during the follow-up, and in transfused or never-transfused patients. Only a few patients were aware of having a liver disease; one-half of HCV-positive patients never had transaminase increase. A review of data from Central and Northern Italy is included, showing similar findings; a report from Japan has confirmed such an association, while limited surveys in England have not revealed any correlation. These findings may have important biological and clinical implications."
2133,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection has been associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); however, the results are inconsistent among regions with different HCV prevalence rates. The temporal relationship, risk estimates, and association between HCV and lymphoid-neoplasms remain unclear. This study investigated the temporal relationship between HCV infection and lymphoid-neoplasms using a nationwide population-based cohort. Patients with chronic HCV infection were retrieved from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database during 2001-2005 and designated as the HCV cohort. Those with prior malignancies or coinfected with hepatitis B or human immunodeficiency virus were excluded. The age, sex, and comorbidities, including rheumatological disorders and diabetes, were matched by propensity scores to another non-HCV cohort. Both cohorts were followed longitudinally until 2009 for a new diagnosis of any lymphoid-neoplasms or NHL. A total of 11,679 HCV and 46,716 non-HCV patients were included and followed for 8 years. The incidence rates of any lymphoid-neoplasms and NHL were significantly greater in the HCV cohort than the non-HCV cohort (48.4 versus 22.1, and 37.0 versus 17.5 per 100,000 person-years, respectively, both P < 0.001), even after we excluded lymphoid-neoplasms developed within the first year of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (after adjustment for age, sex, numbers of annual medical visits during follow-up, and comorbidities) indicated that HCV infection was associated with an increased risk of either any lymphoid-neoplasms (hazard ratio = 2.30, 95% confidence interval 1.55-3.43, P < 0.0001) or NHL (hazard ratio = 2.00, 95% confidence interval 1.27-3.16, P = 0.003)."
5566,0.001,1.0000,"Early studies of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use in clinical practice suggested suboptimal rates of viral suppression. HAART regimens and expertise in the use of HAART have since evolved, and we sought to determine how virologic response to HAART has changed in clinical practice. We compared all patients who started a first HAART regimen from 1996 through 2002 in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected patients in care in Baltimore. There were significant improvements in suppressing HIV RNA to < 400 copies/mL, ranging from 43.8% (1996) to 72.4% (2001-2002) by 6 months and from 60.1% (1996) to 79.9% (2001-2002) by 12 months (both P < 0.01 for trend). There were also significant improvements in CD4 cell response. Over time, there was a significant increase in the use of a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen compared with a single PI as well as an increase in the number of patients who were antiretroviral (ARV) naive. There was also a significant temporal trend from 1996 through 2002 in achieving a suppressed HIV RNA level, adjusting for being ARV naive, specific HAART regimen, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, and demographic factors. This suggests that improved virologic response may also be attributable to other factors such as a greater focus on medication adherence, improved ARV tolerability, and ease of dosing."

The objective of this study was to assess the relative efficacy and toxicity of the dual NRTI part of the regimen in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1-infected adults. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for treatment-naïve HIV-infected adults with a 48-week follow-up were done. We searched the PubMed, CENTRAL, and EMBASE electronic databases up to April 2009. Proceedings from conferences were reviewed. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Primary outcome was viral suppression at 48 weeks. The odds ratio (OR) is reported with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Twenty-two randomized controlled trials, including 8,184 HIV-treatment-naïve patients, were included. The combination didanosine + lamivudine/emtricitabine (four trials, 1,148 patients) was more effective (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.68) for viral load (VL) >50 copies/ml and less toxic (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.36-0.76) for discontinuation due to adverse events (AE) than its comparators. The combination tenofovir + lamivudine/emtricitabine was more effective and less toxic (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96) only in the 144-week follow-up data (two trials, 1,119 patients). Abacavir + lamivudine had similar efficacy to its comparators (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.8-1.1), but more AIDS-defining events (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.24, 8.40). The once-daily combination didanosine + lamivudine/emtricitabine was found to be effective and tolerable. This combination, soon to be generic, should be compared to the current standard of care in a large randomized trial. An effective, safe, and inexpensive alternative to current options is needed."

Key factors involved in the benign course of SIV infection in SMs are the absence of chronic immune activation and low levels of infection of CD4(+) central memory (TCM) and stem cell memory (TSCM) T cells. To better understand the role of virus replication in determining the main features of SIV infection in SMs, we treated 12 SMs with a potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen for 2 to 12 months. We observed that ART suppressed viremia to <60 copies/ml of plasma in 10 of 12 animals and induced a variable decrease in the level of cell-associated SIV DNA in peripheral blood (average changes of 0.9-, 1.1-, 1.5-, and 3.7-fold for CD4(+) transitional memory [TTM], TCM, effector memory [TEM], and TSCM cells, respectively). ART-treated SIV-infected SMs showed (i) increased percentages of circulating CD4(+) TCM cells, (ii) increased levels of CD4(+) T cells in the rectal mucosa, and (iii) significant declines in the frequencies of HLA-DR(+) CD8(+) T cells in the blood and rectal mucosa. In addition, we observed that ART interruption resulted in rapid viral rebound in all SIV-infected SMs, indicating that the virus reservoir persists for at least a year under ART despite lower infection levels of CD4(+) TCM and TSCM cells than those seen in pathogenic SIV infections of macaques. Overall, these data indicate that ART induces specific immunological changes in SIV-infected SMs, thus suggesting that virus replication affects immune function even in the context of this clinically benign infection."
881,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are contagious liver diseases caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV), respectively. In particular, chronic infection with HBV or HCV is a major public health problem throughout Europe. The majority of persons chronically infected (65%-75%) are not aware of their infection status until symptoms of advanced liver disease appear. In addition, the peak in the number of patients suffering from advanced stages of the disease, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, has not yet been reached. In order to reduce the current and future morbidity and mortality associated with chronic HBV or HCV infection, the timely detection of chronically infected persons, with follow-up and case management, is crucial. However, the current screening strategies in Europe and Switzerland have to be considered as inadequate to detect the majority of chronically infected persons. Hence, we emphasise the importance of an alternative approach: the healthcare provider initiated identification of HBV or HCV infection in defined risk groups. This entails determining whether a person is not only at risk of being chronically infected, but also at risk of becoming infected with HBV or HCV and, if necessary, testing for HBV or HCV infection."

HAART was first administered to HIV patients in Cuba in 2001. Consequently with the aim of investigate the behavior of the HVs causing neurological disorders in this population in the post-HAART era, the authors perform a clinical evaluation by a multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for simultaneous detection of human HVs--herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The authors studied 241 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) received at the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Laboratory between 2001 and 2005 inclusive. Of the 241 CSF studied, 10.4% resulted positive for HV infections. Of these, 92% of patients were acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) individuals at the C3 stage. CMV (44%), EBV (28%), and dual-HV (16%) infections were the most important agents identified. The principal clinical manifestations were fever, headache, vomiting, and focal abnormalities; the latter being associated with an increased risk of death. A statistically significant result was observed when central nervous system (CNS) disease evolution was compared between patients who were under HAART against those who were not, before they developed encephalitis. It was therefore concluded that it is more likely that HIV individuals receiving HAART have a better recovery of CNS infections than those who are not receiving it."

After 1, 4, and 8 weeks of nucleoside therapy the average decreased to 23% (P < .001), 7%, and 3%, respectively. The amount of HIV uDNA decreased in all 19 patients during the first week and was undetectable in 14 by 8 weeks. Thus, measurement of HIV uDNA has many characteristics needed for a good marker of therapeutic efficacy of antiretroviral drugs, including detectability in a high proportion of patients, large and rapid response to initiation of therapy, and a biologically plausible mechanism."

We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess virological response and resistance development from ART patients. Between 2006 and 2008, blood was collected from 143 ART patients. Viral load (VL) was determined with a detection limit of 50 copies/ml; those with detectable VL were genotyped with dried plasma spots using a broadly sensitive genotyping assay. Resistance mutations were identified using the Stanford HIV drug resistance database. Of the 143 patients, 72% [95% confidence interval (CI): 65.9-78.2] suppressed their VL to <50 copies/ml. Genotyping analysis of the remaining 40 patients revealed that 21 (53%, CI: 37.0-68.0) harbored one or more mutations. The most common mutations were thymidine-analog mutations (22.5%) and M184V (10%) to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and V106I/A /M (17.5%), Y181C (15%), and H221Y (12.5%) to non-NRTIs (NNRTIs); 13 patients had mutations to both NRTIs and NNRTIs. Patients with VL >1000 copies/ml appear to harbor more mutations than those with VL between 50 and 1000 (62.1% vs. 27.3%, p>0.05). Resistance mutations were intensified among 10 patients for whom two sequential specimens were obtained and accumulation of resistance mutations predicted compromised treatment outcomes and future drug selections. This study provides a snapshot of the virological responses and resistance profiles for patients on first-line regimens, indicating that patient monitoring is a critical component in preventing the accumulation of resistance mutations among patients failing their regimens and thus maintaining the effectiveness of the first-line regimens."

Lower levels of sequence heterogeneity were noted in samples obtained early in HIV-1 infection, prior to CD4 depletion, than in samples obtained at later times during disease. The pattern of amino acid sequence divergence included nonrandom changes, with evidence of sequence variants arising from HIV-1 quasi-species present earlier in infection. Consensus sequences for isolates obtained early after infection from different patients demonstrated a high level of conservation with one another and a consensus sequence for macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolates.

8670,0.001,1.0000,"The biological phenotype of primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates varies according to the severity of the HIV infection. Here we show that the two previously described groups of rapid/high, syncytium-inducing (SI) and slow/low, non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) isolates are distinguished by their ability to utilize different chemokine receptors for entry into target cells. Recent studies have identified the C-X-C chemokine receptor CXCR4 (also named fusin or Lestr) and the C-C chemokine receptor CCR5 as the principal entry cofactors for T-cell-line-tropic and non-T-cell-line-tropic HIV-1, respectively. Using U87.CD4 glioma cell lines, stably expressing the chemokine receptor CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR5, or CXCR4, we have tested chemokine receptor specificity for a panel of genetically diverse envelope glycoprotein genes cloned from primary HIV-1 isolates and have found that receptor usage was closely associated with the biological phenotype of the virus isolate but not the genetic subtype. We have also analyzed a panel of 36 well-characterized primary HIV-1 isolates for syncytium induction and replication in the same series of cell lines. Infection by slow/low viruses was restricted to cells expressing CCR5, whereas rapid/high viruses could use a variety of chemokine receptors. In addition to the regular use of CXCR4, many rapid/high viruses used CCR5 and some also used CCR3 and CCR2b. Progressive HIV-1 infection is characterized by the emergence of viruses resistant to inhibition by beta-chemokines, which corresponded to changes in coreceptor usage. The broadening of the host range may even enable the use of uncharacterized coreceptors, in that two isolates from immunodeficient patients infected the parental U87.CD4 cell line lacking any engineered coreceptor. Two primary isolates with multiple coreceptor usage were shown to consist of mixed populations, one with a narrow host range using CCR5 only and the other with a broad host range using CCR3, CCR5, or CXCR4, similar to the original population. The results show that all 36 primary HIV-1 isolates induce syncytia, provided that target cells carry the particular coreceptor required by the virus."

To determine if oral epithelial cells can be infected with HIV-1 we exposed gingival keratinocytes and adenoid epithelial cells to cell-free virus and HIV-1-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocytes. Using primary isolates we determined that gingival keratinocytes are susceptible to HIV-1 infection via cell-free CD4-independent infection only. R5 but not X4 viral strains were capable of infecting the keratinocytes. Further, infected cells were able to release infectious virus. In addition, primary epithelial cells isolated from adenoids were also susceptible to infection; both cell-free and cell-associated virus infected these cells. These data have potential implications in the transmission of HIV-1 in the oral cavity."

Sera from vaccinees and HIV-1 positive subjects had similar binding titers to native monomeric rgp120W61D and showed a similar titer of antibodies inhibiting the binding of soluble CD4 (sCD4) to rgp120W61D. However, extensive peptide binding studies showed that the overall pattern of recognition of vaccinee and HIV-1-positive sera is different, with vaccinee sera displaying a wider and more potent recognition of linear V1/V2 and V3 domain epitopes. Neutralization of homologous HIV-1W61D or heterologous HIV-1M2424/4 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived virus lines by vaccinee sera could be achieved, but only after adaptation of the viruses to T-cell lines and was quickly lost on readaptation to growth in PBMC. Sera from HIV-positive individuals were able to neutralize both PBMC-grown and T-cell line-adapted viruses. Interestingly, rgp120W61D was recognized by monoclonal antibodies previously shown to neutralize primary HIV-1 isolates. The use of very potent adjuvants and R5X4 rgp120 led to an antibody response equivalent in binding activity and inhibition of binding of sCD4 to gp120 to that of HIV-positive individuals but did not lead to the induction of antibodies capable of neutralizing PBMC-grown virus."
3270,0.001,1.0000,"We have characterized an assay measuring CD8 T cell-mediated inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 replication, demonstrating specificity and reproducibility and employing a panel of primary HIV-1 isolates. The assay uses relatively simple autologous cell culture and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, avoids generation of T cell clones, and can be performed with <2 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Efficient CD8 T cell-mediated cross-clade inhibition of HIV-1 replication in vitro was demonstrated in antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-1-infected subjects with controlled viral replication in vivo but not in viremic subjects. An HIV-1 vaccine candidate, consisting of DNA and recombinant adenovirus 5 vectors tested in a phase I clinical trial, induced CD8 T cells that efficiently inhibited HIV-1 in a HLA-I-dependent manner. Assessment of direct antiviral T cell function by this assay provides additional information to guide vaccine design and the prioritizing of candidates for further clinical trials."
9586,0.001,1.0000,"The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are the major coreceptors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). At least 12 other chemokine receptors or close relatives support infection by particular HIV and SIV strains on CD4(+) transformed indicator cell lines in vitro. However, the role of these alternative coreceptors in vivo is presently thought to be insignificant. Infection of cell lines expressing high levels of recombinant CD4 and coreceptors thus does not provide a true indication of coreceptor use in vivo. We therefore tested primary untransformed cell cultures that lack CCR5 and CXCR4, including astrocytes and brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs), for naturally expressed alternative coreceptors functional for HIV and SIV infection. An adenovirus vector (Ad-CD4) was used to express CD4 in CD4(-) astrocytes and thus confer efficient infection if a functional coreceptor is present. Using a large panel of viruses with well-defined coreceptor usage, we identified a subset of HIV and SIV strains able to infect two astrocyte cultures derived from adult brain tissue. Astrocyte infection was partially inhibited by several chemokines, indicating a role for the chemokine receptor family in the observed infection. BMVECs were weakly positive for CD4 but negative for CCR5 and CXCR4 and were susceptible to infection by the same subset of isolates that infected astrocytes. BMVEC infection was efficiently inhibited by the chemokine vMIP-I, implicating one of its receptors as an alternative coreceptor for HIV and SIV infection. Furthermore, we tested whether the HIV type 1 and type 2 strains identified were able to infect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) via an alternative coreceptor. Several strains replicated in Delta32/Delta32 CCR5 PBMCs with CXCR4 blocked by AMD3100. This AMD3100-resistant replication was also sensitive to vMIP-I inhibition. The nature and potential role of this alternative coreceptor(s) in HIV infection in vivo is discussed."

One hundred and sixty-six out of a total of 188 Slovenian HIV-1-infected individuals and 120 subjects who were randomly chosen out of a total 342 Croatian HIV-1 antibodies-positive individuals were tested for HCV infection. Detection of HCV antibodies was carried out by a third generation enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and the positive samples were additionally tested by a third generation immuno-blot assay. Additionally, the presence of HCV RNA was determined in all serum samples by a qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Twenty-four (14.5%) out of 166 Slovenian and 18 (15.0%) out of 120 Croatian HIV-1-infected individuals were HCV antibodies-positive. Nineteen out of 24 (79.2%) Slovenian and 13 out of 18 (72.2%) Croatian anti-HCV positive individuals were also viremic. HCV RNA was not detected in any of 244 HCV antibodies-negative/HIV-1-infected individual from both countries. A significant difference in the prevalence of HCV infection between blood (77.8% in Slovenia and 66.7% in Croatia) and sexual exposure risk groups (1.6% in Slovenia and 6.6% in Croatia) was found in both countries. In a study carried out on the highest proportion of entire population of HIV-1-infected individuals from a certain country or geographic region, Slovenia and Croatia were identified as countries with the second and third lowest prevalence of HCV infection among HIV-1/HIV-2 infected individuals worldwide."

In Thailand as part of a sentinel surveillance system, we collected data prospectively about pulmonary TB cases treated in public clinics. A subset of HIV-infected TB patients identified through this system had additional data collected for a research study. We conducted multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with MDR-TB. Of 10,428 TB patients, 2,376 (23%) were HIV-infected; 145 (1%) had MDR-TB. Of the MDR-TB cases, 52 (37%) were HIV-infected. Independent risk factors for MDR-TB included age 18-29 years old, male sex, and previous TB treatment, but not HIV infection. Among new patients, having an injection drug use history was a risk factor for MDR-TB. Of 539 HIV-infected TB patients in the research study, MDR-TB was diagnosed in 19 (4%); the only significant risk factors were previous TB treatment and previous hepatitis. In Thailand, HIV is common among MDR-TB patients, but is not an independent risk factor for MDR-TB. Populations at high risk for HIV-young adults, men, injection drug users - should be prioritized for drug susceptibility testing."

In this study, we demonstrated the presence of IgG-class anti-HCV-antibody, HCV-RNA and IgA-class rheumatoid factor in the cryoprecipitate. These results suggest that the cryoglobulinaemia in this case was caused by aggregation of an immune complex comprised of HCV and anti-HCV antibody with IgA-type-rheumatoid factor, and that this led to a cutaneous vasculitis."

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of occult HBV infection and its clinical and virological features in the community of Solomon Islands. Blood samples were collected from a total of 564 asymptomatic individuals aged over 18 years in the Western province. The samples used in the present study consisted of 200 samples from 108 males and 92 females (mean age, 37.4 years; range, 18-71 years) that were randomly selected among the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative samples from all the participants enrolled in this study. HBV-DNA was detected by real-time PCR in 25 (12.5%) of the 200 HBsAg-negative samples. Most of the HBV-DNA-positive individuals were infected with wild-type HBV, and only 3 strains demonstrated specific amino acid substitutions (P121X, T123N, C138S, P142S and D144E) in the α determinant region. In conclusion, occult HBV infection was documented in 12.5% of individuals that demonstrated serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection in this study. The prevalence of occult infection was also influenced by ethnicity; it was more prevalent in Melanesians than Micronesians. In addition, occult HBV infection demonstrated a weak association with the S-variants."

This study evaluated the prevalence of coinfection by human immunodeficiency virus and viral hepatitis in an endemic area for hepatitis B in the Western Amazon basin. Serological markers for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and hepatitis D virus were tested in a consecutive sample of all patients referred for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The variables sex, age, origin and exposure category were obtained from medical records and from the sexually transmitted diseases and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome surveillance database. Among 704 subjects, the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B carriage was 6.4% and past infection 40.2%. The presence of hepatitis B was associated with birth in hyperendemic areas of the Amazon basin, male sex and illegal drug use. The overall prevalence of hepatitis C was 5% and was associated with illegal drug use. The prevalence of hepatitis B and C among human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients in the Western Amazon basin was lower than seen elsewhere and is probably associated with the local epidemiology of these viruses and the degree of overlap of their shared risk factors. An opportunity presents itself to evaluate the prevention of hepatitis C through harm reduction policies and hepatitis B through vaccination programs among human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients."

Nonetheless, exact information on the magnitude and trends of recently acquired infections is missing. In a cross-sectional study we aimed to determine HIV prevalence, the proportion of recently acquired infections and the incidence among patients attending a Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) clinic and among HIV positive cases tested at the AIDS Reference Laboratory (ARL), by using the Avidity Index (AI) of antibodies to identify recent HIV-1 seroconversions. Demographic and behavioural data were collected. At the STI clinic 253 patients were enrolled, 16 were found to be HIV infected (14 HIV-1, 2 HIV-2) and a prevalence of 6.3% was obtained. Four recent HIV-1 infections were identified and the HIV-1 incidence was 3.3% per year. At the ARL, 332 newly diagnosed cases of HIV-1 infection were studied, 59 (17.8%) were recent infections and an annual incidence of 4.1% was estimated. These findings support STI clinics as key sentinel sites for recently acquired HIV infections and illustrate the viability of testing for recent HIV infections in these settings and reinforce the value of this method in the surveillance for better monitoring current trends of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Portugal."

Overall 5.5% were HBsAg positive, 2.4% HBeAg positive, 52% anti-HBc positive and 6.6% were positive for anti-HD. Anti-HD was identified in 18% of addicts who were HBsAg positive and in 3% who were HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive. Strong correlation was found between positivity to HBV antibodies and age and duration of drug use. History of jaundice correlated more strongly with anti-HD positivity than with presence of antibodies to HBV. We conclude that Israeli IVDA are less exposed to HBV and HDV infection than their North American and European counterparts."

These infections may influence each other in evolution and outcome, including cancer or immunodeficiency. Many studies have reported the influence of genetic markers on the host immune response against different persistent viral infections, such as HTLV-1 infection, pointing to the importance of the individual genetic background on their outcomes. However, despite recent advances on the knowledge of the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection, gaps in the understanding of the role of the individual genetic background on the progress to disease clinically manifested still remain. In this scenario, much less is known regarding the influence of genetic factors in the context of dual or triple infections or their influence on the underlying mechanisms that lead to outcomes that differ from those observed in monoinfection. This review describes the main factors involved in the virus-host balance, especially for some particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes, and other important genetic markers in the development of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and other persistent viruses, such as HIV and HCV.

8070,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C (HCV) treatment for patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV is associated with modest rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) and an increased rate of relapse when compared to HCV monoinfected patients. As patients who attain SVR and patients who relapse are clinically indistinguishable during treatment, where both groups have fully suppressed HCV viral load, it has not been possible to identify in advance those who will relapse. Biomarkers that may distinguish patients with differential treatment response may be clinically useful and provide insight into mechanisms of relapse. In this retrospective study, serum and PBMCs were obtained from 41 HIV/HCV co-infected patients and 17 healthy volunteers. Changes in antibody titers to various regions of the HCV proteome during treatment for HCV were determined using a novel luciferase immunoprecipitation assay. Changes in B-cell subtypes in patients with differential treatment response as well as healthy volunteers were compared. This study demonstrates that elevated anti-HCV core antibody titers persisted during HCV treatment in patients who relapsed when compared to those who attained SVR. Furthermore, characterization of B cells in patients who relapsed demonstrated an abnormal B-cell phenotype distribution characterized by elevated frequencies of exhausted B cells among relapsers at baseline, which persisted despite suppression of HCV viremia at 24 weeks, along with increased frequencies of plasmablasts. These data suggest that anti-HCV specific B cells may be responding to ongoing subclinical HCV replication in patients who will relapse."
4760,0.001,1.0000,"We have previously shown, using human T-cell lymphocytotrophic virus-I (HTLV-I)-infected cell lines, that soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) is generated through an alternative splicing mechanism. In this study, we examined human sera for the presence of alternatively spliced soluble IL-6R (AS-sIL-6R). We produced a monoclonal antibody (mAb) recognizing the unique sequence of AS-sIL-6R peptide, generated by an altered reading frame. We also made recombinant AS-sIL-6R protein in Spodoptera frugiperda-9 (Sf-9) cells carrying baculovirus, which encoded altered sIL-6R or conventional IL-6R cDNA. mAbs specifically recognized AS-sIL-6R, but not conventional IL-6R, as demonstrated by Western blot analyses, fluorescence-activated cell sorter, immunofluorescence analyses and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We adapted an ELISA system and used it for detection of altered sIL-6R in sera from 23 healthy persons, 12 patients with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) and 13 patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM). Serum levels of AS-sIL-6R were 6.4 or 6.1 times greater in ATL (28.7+/-20.4 ng/ml, P<0.0001) and in HAM patients (27.5+/-12.1 ng/ml, P<0.0001) than in healthy individuals (4.5+/-2.1 ng/ml). High levels of AS-sIL-6R were also observed in plasma from rheumatoid arthritis patients and in persons with elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), antinuclear antibody (ANA), or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). However, in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected individuals, AS-sIL-6R levels were not elevated. In this study, we confirmed that AS-sIL-6R is indeed present in human sera. These observations suggest that alternative splicing of IL-6R mRNA is of consequence in ATL, HAM and in some autoimmune diseases. The HTLV-I-infected T cells appeared to play an important role in AS-sIL-6R production."
4566,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of transfusion-induced chronic liver disease in hemophiliacs, with 70% to 90% being anti-HCV positive. Seroreversion or loss of antibody response to HCV has been observed in a small proportion of human immunodeficiency virus-positive [HIV(+)] anti-HCV(+) hemophilic men. Despite the seroreversion to an anti-HCV-negative state, such patients continue to show serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations and biopsy evidence of cirrhosis and/or chronic active hepatitis. To determine the cause for the loss of anti-HCV antibody, we compared first- and second-generation anti-HCV enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA 1.0 and 2.0), second-generation recombinant immunoblot (RIBA 2.0), and HCV-RNA amplification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 19 ""seroreverters"" before and after seroreversion. There was no difference between 19 seroreverters and 59 persistently anti-HCV-positive hemophiliacs in mean ALT (1.1 +/- 0.1 XUL v 2.0 +/- 0.2 XUL; chi 2 = 1.80, P > .05), in mean CD4 (188 +/- 36/microL v 232 +/- 28/microL; t = 0.965, P > .05), or in the rate of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (13 of 19 [68.4%] v 30 of 59 [50.9%]; chi 2 = .987, P > .05, respectively). Before seroreversion, all 19 seroreverters (100%) were positive for EIA 1.0 and 2.0 and PCR, and all but 2 of 19 (89.5%) were RIBA 2.0 positive, whereas, after seroreversion, none were positive for EIA 1.0, 15 of 19 (78.9%) were positive for EIA 2.0, 8 of 18 (44.4%) were positive for RIBA 2.0, and 18 of 19 (94.7%) were positive for PCR. There was a lower CD4 lymphocyte number after seroreversion in those who were RIBA 2.0 negative as compared with those who were RIBA 2.0 positive (32 +/- 10/microL v 171 +/- 52/microL; t = 2.638, P > .05). These results indicate that HIV(+) anti-HCV(+) hemophilic men who undergo ""HCV seroreversion"" are truly infectious and anti-HCV positive by second-generation tests. Anti-HCV detection in immunosuppressed hosts is significantly improved by second-generation EIA and RIBA assays."

Our findings indicate that there are differences by ethnicity and birthplace among Asian Americans in terms of follow-up care and treatment. In addition, our study indicates that there were substantial knowledge gaps regarding contracting HBV, transmission, and prevention. We found that HBV-infected respondents had many fears about their infection. Three primary concerns were identified: (a) concerns related to liver cancer and overall health, (b) transmission to loved ones, and (c) stigma. Our findings indicate that Asian Americans chronically infected with HBV need more education to manage HBV including information on the importance of follow-up treatment and care and education on preventing transmission, risk for liver cancer, and HBV impact on overall health.

8166,0.001,1.0000,"Increased treatment options that are more efficacious and safe and new knowledge on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection have expanded the indications for therapy in hepatitis B. The question is no longer ""Who should be treated?"" but ""When should treatment be initiated?"" Treatment is clearly indicated in patients with life-threatening liver disease (acute liver failure, decompensated cirrhosis, or severe hepatitis flare) and in those with compensated cirrhosis and high levels of serum HBV DNA. For patients with precirrhotic liver disease, treatment indications should be based on clinical, biochemical, or histological evidence of liver disease, such as elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, abnormal histology, and high levels of serum HBV DNA. The cutoff for ALT and HBV DNA values are constantly being revised and should be set at a lower level for older patients who may have been infected for a longer period of time. High serum HBV DNA levels persisting for a few decades are associated with increased risk of clinical outcomes, but there is insufficient data to support the initiation of treatment based on high serum HBV DNA alone, particularly in young patients, those with persistently normal ALT levels, and those with a single high HBV DNA level. The decision to initiate treatment at the time of assessment or to defer treatment should take into consideration other factors such as desire to start a family, occupational requirement, family history of hepatocellular carcinoma, access to care and insurance coverage, and commitment to long-term treatment and medication compliance. All patients who are not initiated on treatment should continue to be monitored so treatment can be started if and when the indication arises."
6302,0.001,1.0000,"In order to study the effect of increased CD4 cell counts on the biology of hepatitis C virus (HCV), we analyzed the genetic variability of HCV generated over 8 y in eight human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and HCV co-infected patients. This was a retrospective study in which HIV patients were selected who had profound immune impairment evident over four years and were co-infected with HCV genotype 1 and who then went on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). These patients achieved different degrees of immune reconstitution, measured as increased CD4 cell counts during a 4- to 8-y period, following initiation of HAART. HCV genetic variability was determined by measuring the genetic diversity (Hamming distance, HD), and complexity (number of viral variants) in plasma samples collected at yearly intervals just before and after the initiation of HAART. The parameters were assessed by molecular cloning and sequencing of a 575-bp fragment including the HCV envelope 1 and envelope 2 genes (E1/E2), containing the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1). significantly increased HVR1 genetic diversity was observed in analyzed samples where the patients' CD4 cell counts were > or =100 compared with CD4 cell counts <100. A significant increase in genetic diversity in HVR1 was detected in co-infected patients whose CD4 cell counts increased from <100 to >400 over a period of more than 4 y of HAART therapy. This was in contrast to a minimal increase in HCV genetic diversity of HVR1 occurring in patients whose CD4 cell counts failed to rise much over 200 over 7 y of follow up. Insertion and deletion of HCV genomic fragments in the E1/E2 region was documented in one patient who developed fulminant hepatitis C."

A retrospective cohort study of HIV/HCV coinfected adults from two HIV treatment centers covering the period between December 1998 and December 2003 was conducted to address this question. The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) during follow-up and the primary predictors of interest were specific antiretrovirals. One hundred five coinfected patients receiving cART for a median of 70 months (interquartile range [IQR], 37, 83) were included in the analysis. Twenty-three (22%) patients developed a grade 3 or 4 increase in serum ALT at least once in follow-up. In univariate analysis, current receipt of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (odds ratio [OR] 3.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-8.34, p = 0.03), baseline ALT (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p = 0.004), and current use of boosting ritonavir (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.16-7.00, p = 0.02) were significantly associated with a grade 3 or 4 increase in serum ALT, although most patients receiving boosting ritonavir were on lopinavir/ritonavir based regimens. Patients receiving LPV/r had been previously exposed to significantly more antiretrovirals (p < 0.0001), protease inhibitors (p < 0.0001), and nucleoside analogues (p = 0.0009) compared to the rest of the cohort. Further research to better clarify risk factors for hepatotoxicity in coinfected patients is warranted given the challenges in treating this population."
8872,0.001,1.0000,"Transcriptional regulation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a complex event that requires the cooperative action of both viral (e.g. Tat) and cellular (e.g. C/EBPbeta, NF-kappaB) factors. The HIV-1 Tat protein recruits the human positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb, consisting of cdk9 and cyclin T1, to the HIV-1 transactivation response (TAR) region. In the absence of TAR, Tat activates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) through its association with several cellular factors including C/EBPbeta. C/EBPbeta is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family of transcription factors and has been shown to be a critical transcriptional regulator of HIV-1 LTR. We examined whether Tat-C/EBPbeta association requires the presence of the P-TEFb complex. Using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot, we demonstrated that C/EBPbeta-cyclin T1 association requires the presence of cdk9. Further, due to its instability, cdk9 was unable to physically interact with C/EBPbeta in the absence of cyclin T1 or Tat. Using kinase assays, we demonstrated that cdk9, but not a cdk9 dominant-negative mutant (cdk9-dn), phosphorylates C/EBPbeta. Our functional data show that co-transfection of C/EBPbeta and cdk9 leads to an increase in HIV-1 gene expression when compared to C/EBPbeta alone. Addition of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) inhibits C/EBPbeta transcriptional activity in the presence and absence of cdk9 and causes a delay in HIV-1 replication in T-cells. Together, our data suggest that Tat-C/EBPbeta association is mediated through cdk9, and that phosphorylated C/EBPbeta may influence AIDS progression by increasing expression of HIV-1 genes."

To establish the prevalence of HDV infection in haemophilic patients and patients without haemophilia, 87 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were examined for serological evidence of delta hepatitis. In addition HBV, HDV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection markers were compared to clinical and histopathological outcome of hepatitis. Out of 46 haemophiliacs 30 (65%) were anti-HD-seropositive; 10 out of 30 anti-HD-positive patients (33%) had pathological liver function tests compared to 2 out of 16 anti-HD-negative haemophiliacs (13%). The rate of HIV infection did not differ between the HDV infected and the non-HDV infected individuals with haemophilia (17/27 anti-HD-positive patients versus 12/16 anti-HD-negative patients). Two haemophilic anti-HD-positive patients underwent liver biopsy, in both cases hepatitis D antigen (HDAg) was detected in the biopsies. Only 2 out of 41 patients without haemophilia were anti-HD-positive. Both had pathological liver function tests; chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis, respectively, were diagnosed and HDAg was found in the liver biopsies. Out of 39 anti-HD-seronegative patients without haemophilia, 26 (67%) were hepatitis B e antigen positive; in the sera of 20 patients (51%) HBV-DNA was demonstrated, but only 6 patients (15%) had pathological liver function tests. In conclusion a high seroprevalence of HDV infection was found in haemophilic patients treated with non-pasteurized commercial clotting factor concentrates.

2978,0.001,1.0000,"Our goal was to determine if paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity relates to the presence of metabolic syndrome (MS) and inflammation in HIV patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This was a prospective, multicenter study including 269 patients receiving HAART for at least 1 year and a maximum of 4 years. PON1 and inflammatory markers [C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum amyloid A (SAA), and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors 2 (sTNF-R2)] were compared between patients with or without MS and the association between inflammatory markers and PON1 was assessed by logistic regression analyses. MS was found in 18.2% of the patients. Inflammatory markers, with the exception of sTNF-R2, were significantly higher, while PON1 activity was significantly lower in the presence of metabolic syndrome. PON1 activity was significantly related to apolipoprotein C3, CD4 count, and sTNF-R2. It may be concluded that PON1 appears to be a marker for the metabolic syndrome in HIV-infected subjects. PON1 activity is related to dyslipidemia and the immunological status of the patients but is not fully determined by inflammation."
8584,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic viral infections can infect sperm and are considered a risk factor in male infertility. Recent studies have shown that the presence of HIV, HBV or HCV in semen impairs sperm parameters, DNA integrity, and in particular reduces forward motility. In contrast, very little is known about semen infection with human papillomaviruses (HPV), herpesviruses (HSV), cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and adeno-associated virus (AAV). At present, EU directives for the viral screening of couples undergoing assisted reproduction techniques require only the evaluation of HIV, HBV, and HCV. However, growing evidence suggests that HPV, HSV, and HCMV might play a major role in male infertility and it has been demonstrated that HPV semen infection has a negative influence on sperm parameters, fertilization, and the abortion rate. Besides the risk of horizontal or vertical transmission, the negative impact of any viral sperm infection on male reproductive function seems to be dramatic. In addition, treatment with antiviral and antiretroviral therapies may further affect sperm parameters. In this review we attempted to focus on the interactions between defined sperm viral infections and their association with male fertility disorders. All viruses considered in this article have a potentially negative effect on male reproductive function and dangerous infections can be transmitted to partners and newborns. In light of this evidence, we suggest performing targeted sperm washing procedures for each sperm infection and to strongly consider screening male patients seeking fertility for HPV, HSV, and HCMV, both to avoid viral transmission and to improve assisted or even spontaneous fertility outcome.

7779,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis A remains a serious vaccine-preventable disease for HIV patients. We tested 897 HIV-infected men having sex with men (MSM) for antibodies against hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) and measured the geometric mean antibody titres (GMTs) in a group of patients who received a hepatitis A vaccine and in patients with immunity to HAV due to infection in childhood. In all, 320 patients (35%) had positive anti-HAV antibodies. Multivariate analysis showed that only age (p 0.001) and ethnic origin (OR 20.029, p 0.001) had a statistically significant effect on the presence of antibodies. In addition, age was a fairly sensitive (68.4%) and specific (64.2%) marker, patients being separated by the 36.5 years cut-off point. The response rate of patients who get vaccinated (n 383), one month following the administration of the second dose of the vaccine, was 76%. The GMT of the vaccinated patients was 305 mIU/ml versus 7105 mIU/ml of patients with past infection. The vast majority of HIV-infected MSM patients in Greece is susceptible to HAV. Immunity to HAV in newly vaccinated patients, unlike patients with natural immunity, is low and probably requires monitoring. "
2794,0.001,1.0000,"An increased incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported among human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients or those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite this association, hitherto only a single case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported in an HIV-infected patient during pregnancy. We describe a young multiparous patient with long-standing AIDS who presented with lower abdominal pain. Following findings of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, low-grade fever, and mental status changes, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was diagnosed after initially considering the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia, and the patient was delivered by cesarean section. The patient required multiple plasma exchanges during a protracted postpartum course, and was discharged in good health. This first report of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and AIDS in pregnancy demonstrates that when encountering preeclampsia in patients with AIDS, thrombotic microangiopathy should be strongly considered. In addition, these patients may exhibit an attenuated response to plasma exchange therapy and despite previous reports in nonobstetric patients, a favorable outcome is attainable in these critically ill patients."
5657,0.001,1.0000,"HIV replication occurs throughout the natural course of infection in secondary lymphoid tissues and in particular within the germinal centers (GCs), where follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are adjacent to CD4(+) T cells. Because FDCs provide signaling that increases lymphocyte activation, we postulated that FDCs could increase human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication. We cultured HIV-infected CD4(+) T cells alone or with FDCs and measured subsequent virus expression using HIV-p24 production and reverse transcription-PCR analyses. When cultured with FDCs, infected CD4(+) T cells produced almost fourfold more HIV than when cultured alone, and the rate of virus transcription was doubled. Both FDCs and their supernatant increased HIV transcription and resulted in nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and phosphorylated c-Jun in infected cells. FDCs produced soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) ex vivo, and the addition of a blocking soluble TNF receptor ablated FDC-mediated HIV transcription. Furthermore, TNF-alpha was found highly expressed within GCs, and ex vivo GC CD4(+) T cells supported greater levels of HIV-1 replication than other CD4(+) T cells. These data indicated that FDCs increase HIV transcription and production by a soluble TNF-alpha-mediated mechanism. This FDC-mediated effect may account, at least in part, for the presence of persistent HIV replication in GCs. Therefore, in addition to providing an important reservoir of infectious virus, FDCs increase HIV production, contributing to a tissue microenvironment that is highly conducive to HIV transmission and expression."
7648,0.001,1.0000,"A broad Gag-specific CD8(+) T-cell response is associated with effective control of adult human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The association of certain HLA class I molecules, such as HLA-B*57, -B*5801, and -B*8101, with immune control is linked to mutations within Gag epitopes presented by these alleles that allow HIV to evade the immune response but that also reduce viral replicative capacity. Transmission of such viruses containing mutations within Gag epitopes results in lower viral loads in adult recipients. In this study of pediatric infection, we tested the hypothesis that children may tend to progress relatively slowly if either they themselves possess one of the protective HLA-B alleles or the mother possesses one of these alleles, thereby transmitting a low-fitness virus to the child. We analyzed HLA type, CD8(+) T-cell responses, and viral sequence changes for 61 mother-child pairs from Durban, South Africa, who were monitored from birth. Slow progression was significantly associated with the mother or child possessing one of the protective HLA-B alleles, and more significantly so when the protective allele was not shared by mother and child (P = 0.007). Slow progressors tended to make CD8(+) T-cell responses to Gag epitopes presented by the protective HLA-B alleles, in contrast to progressors expressing the same alleles (P = 0.07; Fisher's exact test). Mothers expressing the protective alleles were significantly more likely to transmit escape variants within the Gag epitopes presented by those alleles than mothers not expressing those alleles (75% versus 21%; P = 0.001). Reversion of transmitted escape mutations was observed in all slow-progressing children whose mothers possessed protective HLA-B alleles. These data show that HLA class I alleles influence disease progression in pediatric as well as adult infection, both as a result of the CD8(+) T-cell responses generated in the child and through the transmission of low-fitness viruses by the mother."
2313,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with some B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B cell-NHLs). Patients with HCV infection frequently show co-infections with GB virus C (GBV-C, formerly known as hepatitis G virus), and some studies have suggested a higher incidence of GBV-C infection in patients with B cell-NHLs. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the association between HCV and/or GBV-C infection and B cell-NHLs in different geographic areas. One hundred thirty-seven lymphoma cases and 125 non-lymphoma matched controls were enrolled in an international case-control study conducted in Switzerland (Bellinzona), Spain (Barcelona) and England (Southampton) on samples collected from 2001 to 2002. In Bellinzona (41 cases and 81 controls), the overall prevalence of HCV was 3.3% (4.9% in NHLs), and the overall prevalence of GBV-C was 24% (22% in NHLs). In Barcelona (46 cases and 44 controls), the prevalence of HCV was 10% (8.7% in NHLs) and the prevalence of GBV-C 20% (13% in NHLs). There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of both infections between patients with NHL and controls. In Southampton, 50 NHL cases were analysed, none of them was found to be HCV-positive; therefore, no control group was analysed and GBV-C analysis was not performed, too. Both in Bellinzona and in Barcelona, the seropositivity rate was significantly lower for HCV than for GBV-C, suggesting that their transmission can be independent. The incidence of HCV was significantly higher in Barcelona than that in Bellinzona. This study confirmed the existence of marked geographic differences in the prevalence of HCV in NHL but cannot provide any significant evidence for an association between HCV and/or GBV-C and B-cell NHLs."
8772,0.001,1.0000,"Individuals with serious mental illness are at higher risk for HIV than are members of the general population. Although studies have shown that individuals with serious mental illness experience less adequate care and worse physical health outcomes than comparable patients without serious mental illness, little is known about HIV care among individuals with serious mental illness who become infected with HIV. In the present study, we describe patterns of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) use and physician monitoring received by 154 patients with serious mental illness infected with HIV. Participants were recruited from mental health agencies in Los Angeles, California. Data from 762 HIV-only patients from a separate Western U.S. probability sample were used for comparison. High proportions of serious mental illness patients with HIV in our sample appeared to be receiving adequate HIV care. Fifty-one percent of all serious mental illness patients with serious mental illness with HIV were taking HAART, and the majority received close monitoring of their CD4 counts (84%) and viral loads (82%) throughout a 1-year period. HAART use and patterns of CD4 count and viral load monitoring did not differ significantly between patients with both serious mental illness and HIV, and patients with HIV only (all p > 0.05). Specialized programs providing assistance to serious mental illness populations with HIV may be helping to narrow health care disparities as a result of having serious mental illness."
5568,0.001,1.0000,"Initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with low CD4 counts or AIDS-defining illnesses (ADIs) increases risk of treatment failure and death. We examined factors associated with late initiation among 18- to 29-year-olds within the Canadian Observational Cohort (CANOC) collaboration, a multi-site study of HIV-positive persons who initiated HAART after 2000. Late initiation was defined as beginning HAART with a CD4 count <200 cells/mm(3) and/or having a baseline ADI. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent correlates of late initiation. In total, 1026 individuals (422 from British Columbia, 400 from Ontario, and 204 from Quebec) met our age criteria. At HAART initiation, median age was 27 years (interquartile range, 24, 28 years). A total of 412 individuals (40%) identified as late initiators. Late initiation was associated with female gender, age >25 years at initiation, initiating treatment in earlier years, and having higher baseline viral load. The high number of young adults in our cohort starting HAART late indicates important target populations for specialized services, increased testing, and linkages to care. "
3188,0.001,1.0000,"A cross-sectional study of stable monogamous couples, recruited from 16 clinical and surveillance centers in Italy between 1987 and 1992, was carried out to investigate the risk factors of woman-to-man sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The male partners of all HIV-infected women attending the centers were invited to participate in the study. Of the 275 male partners who were tested for HIV and interviewed with use of a structured questionnaire, 51 were excluded because they had other possible risk factor for HIV infection, no established risk factor was found in the index case, or they had stopped engaging in sexual intercourse. Fourteen of the 224 men (6.3%) were seropositive for HIV. At logistic regression, the highest risks of transmission were for men practicing peno-anal intercourse [odds ratio (OR), 4.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-22.2] and for men whose partner had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or a CD4+ lymphocyte count of < or = 400/mm3. No seropositive men were observed among those who were aware of the woman's HIV seropositivity since the beginning of the relationship or were partners of a zidovudine-treated woman. The results suggest that the risk factors described in man-to-woman and man-to-man HIV sexual transmission also operate in woman-to-man transmission."
2475,0.001,1.0000,"The increase in immigration from less developed countries to Europe has led to an increase in the incidence of hepatitis B infection. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical, epidemiological characteristics and indications for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in a cohort of immigrants, given the relative lack of current evidence. We performed a noninterventional retrospective chart review; different characteristics depending on geographical origin were compared. A case-control study was also performed to describe factors potentially associated with chronic or past hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We selected a random sample of 436 patients out of the 2989 immigrants attending during the study period (1989-2008). Hepatitis B serology was performed in 74% (322/436): 10.6% had chronic HBV infection (95% CI: 7.4-13.7%), and 46.9% had evidence of past infection (95% CI: 41.7-52.0%). The average age was 31 years, 60% were men, and 70% were sub-Saharan Africans. Chronic infection was related to being men (OR 2.03; 95%CI: 1.29-3.18), younger (OR 0.98; 0.96-0.99) and sub-Saharan African (OR 5.41; 2.71-10.83). Past or current infection was related to male sex (OR 2.80; 1.81-4.30), longer time elapsed until first seen at the unit (OR 0.998; 0.997-1.000), HIV infection (OR 4.99; 1.15-21.60) and being sub-Saharan African (OR 15.46; 8.97-27.18). These associations were not confirmed after adjustment for geographical origin. In 27% and 29.5% of patients, liver biopsy and treatment, respectively, would have been indicated. Prevalence of chronic HBV infection amongst immigrants is high, especially in sub-Saharan Africans. Almost a third could be considered for liver biopsy or antiviral therapy."
7167,0.001,1.0000,"It is very likely that perinatal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is influenced by a combination of virologic and host factors. A greater understanding of the role played by various risk factors for HIV-1 infection is crucial for the design of new preventive and therapeutic strategies. In recent years, a number of studies have suggested that host genetic factors are important determinants of both the susceptibility to perinatal HIV-1 infection and the subsequent pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Control of HIV-1 infection involves the processing of specific viral peptides and their presentation to cells of the immune system by highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. The contribution of multiple HLA class I and II alleles in modulating pediatric HIV/AIDS outcomes has now been confirmed by several independent groups. Penetration of HIV-1 into cells is mediated by interaction between CD4 and chemokine receptors that serve as entry coreceptors. Genetic polymorphisms in chemokine ligand and chemokine receptor genes have recently been associated both with mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission and disease progression in children. These observations suggest a key role for genetic factors in pediatric HIV-1 infection. This article describes the current state of knowledge regarding host genetic influences on pediatric HIV-1 infection and discusses the role of these genes in HIV/AIDS pathogenesis."
235,0.001,1.0000,"Recent research has shown that anemia and transfusion are associated with accelerated mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. It appears that blood transfusions may directly accelerate HIV-1 disease progression through activation of HIV-1 expression and/or transfusion related immunosuppression. In vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that immunization with common recall antigens (eg, tetanus toxoid) can significantly increase plasma HIV viremia, as well as the in vitro susceptibility of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to acute infection. Allogeneic leukocytes also present an antigenic challenge to HIV-infected mononuclear cells, which may cause them to proliferate and increase viral production. In vitro incubation of HIV-infected mononuclear cells with allogeneic blood components (mainly leukocytes) results in increased viral replication. Whether the effects of transfusion on HIV viral load are due to a reduced immune response and/or activation of the virus itself remains to be determined. An ongoing study is evaluating the effects of depleting leukocytes from blood prior to transfusion in HIV-infected patients. Patients are randomized to receive standard of leukocyte-depleted red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and the effect of transfusion on HIV replication is measured. Preliminary data suggest that leukocyte depletion prior to RBC transfusion does not alter viral replication compared with standard packed RBC transfusions."
3296,0.001,1.0000,"There have been reported cases of long-term symptomless human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, but it is not clear whether the benign course of infection was due to host, viral, or other unknown factors. During follow-up of subjects with transfusion-acquired HIV-1 infection in New South Wales, Australia, we identified a group of 6 subjects who had been infected through a single common donor. We were therefore able to study the contributions of various factors to the course of infection. Throughout follow-up (range 6.8-10.1 years after infection), 5 of the recipients and the donor (last follow-up 10.2 years after infection of the first recipient) remained clinically free of symptoms, with normal CD4 cell counts and no p24 antigenaemia. HIV-1 was isolated from only 1 recipient; the isolate did not induce syncytia in a SUPT1 co-culture assay and had a limited in-vitro host range. 1 infected recipient (who had received extensive immunosuppressive treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus) developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and died 4.3 years after infection. The frequency of progression to AIDS or a CD4 cell count below 0.50 x 10(9)/l was significantly lower among the 6 subjects with a common donor (1/6) than among 101 other HIV-infected transfusion recipients for whom data from 7 years of follow-up were available (94/101; p less than 0.0001). These findings suggest that the subjects were infected by a less virulent strain of HIV-1. The identification of this group of subjects should stimulate a search for other similar groups, which will provide important information on the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 disease."

Because the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is an integral component of the immune response, we hypothesized that the highly polymorphic HLA genes were the key determinants of HBV persistence and clearance. The present study aimed to calculate the allelic frequency of HLA loci and investigate the association between HLA alleles and the outcome of OBI in Shaanxi Han population in the northwest of China."
1550,0.001,1.0000,"Determination of serum iron levels in patients affected by chronic hepatitis C is considered fundamental for studying the response to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment. IFN could induce anemia, which is promptly corrected by exogenous administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). The aim of our study was to verify the possible beneficial effect of rHuEPO in patients affected by chronic hepatitis C and treated with IFN. Seventy consecutive patients (42 males and 28 females, mean age 46.4+/-5.2 years) affected by chronic hepatitis C were enrolled. In all patients, chronic hepatitis C was diagnosed on the basis of clinical and biological findings (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] serum levels at least 2-fold higher than normal values for at least 12 months and the presence of anti-HCV antibodies). All patients were negative for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, hepatitis D virus (HDV infection, and HIV infection. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Wilcoxon nonparametric sum rank test, the Spearman correlation rank test, and the Friedman ANOVA and Kendall coefficient of concordance. At the end of the treatment, our study series showed significant differences in serum levels of AST (p < 0.001), iron (p < 0.001), and ferritin (p < 0.001). At the end of the follow-up period, significant differences were seen in ALT, aspartate (AST), and iron ferritin and transferrin levels. All differences favored patients who received IFN-alpha and rHuEPO. We think that the depletion of circulating iron may improve the immune response impaired by iron accumulation in the liver. Our study confirms the important role played by iron in the response to IFN treatment, suggesting that the use of rHuEPO induces a better response to IFN in patients with chronic hepatitis C by activation of erythropoiesis."
9669,0.001,1.0000,"In chronic HIV infection a progressive Th1 to Th2/Th0 cytokine-profile shift is related to disease progression. One of the possible benefits of a therapeutic vaccination might be to counterbalance this phenomenon to allow viral replication control under a Th1-type immune response. TERAVAC-HIV-1 is a multiantigenic formulation vaccine candidate against HIV-1 which comprises the recombinant protein CR3 that contains T cell epitopes and the surface and nucleocapsid antigens of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). Previous studies showed that such virus like particles of the HBV provide a Th1 adjuvant effect. The present studies examined the capacity of TERAVAC to elicit a Th1 response in the presence of an ongoing HIV-specific Th2-type response in Balb/c mice. To examine this issue, we injected subcutaneously the animals with CR3 or viral lysate in alum which resulted in a Th2-type response. The CR3-specific Th2-type response was verified by induction of IL-4 and IL-10 secretion in ex vivo stimulated splenocytes without secretion of IFN-γ and IgG2a antibodies in serum. Further subcutaneous and simultaneous subcutaneous-nasal immunizations of the same mice with TERAVAC promoted IFN-γ secretion and production of IgG2a antibodies in accordance with a Th1-type response. This result suggests a therapeutic benefit of this vaccine candidate in the restoration of the Th1-type HIV-specific cellular response in seropositive patients."
10,0.001,1.0000,"We compared the Framingham risk score (FRS) for 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in age- and race-matched hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected and HCV-uninfected persons: 114,073 HCV-infected (111,436 HCV-monoinfected and 2,637 HIV/HCV-coinfected) and 122,996 HCV-uninfected (121,380 HIV and HCV-uninfected and 1,616 HIV-monoinfected) males without cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or hepatitis B. In unadjusted analyses, FRS was similar between the HCV-infected and HCV-uninfected groups [median (interquartile range, IQR) risk points 13 (10-14) vs. 13 (10-14), p=0.192]. Cholesterol levels were lower and current smoking more prevalent in the HCV groups (both HCV and HIV/HCV) compared with the uninfected groups (p<0.001 for both). Prevalence of non-FRS CHD risk factors, such as substance abuse and chronic kidney disease, in the cohort was high, and differed by HCV and HIV status. Adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, chronic kidney disease, drug and alcohol use, and HIV status, HCV infection was associated with minimally lower FRS (β=-0.095 risk points, p<0.001), suggesting a small but significant difference in 10-year CHD risk estimation in HCV-infected as compared to HCV-uninfected persons when measuring risk by FRS. Given the complex relationship between HCV, HIV, and CHD risk factors, some of which are not captured by the FRS, the FRS may underestimate CHD risk in HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected persons. HCV- and HIV/HCV-specific risk scores may be needed to optimize CHD risk stratification."
5638,0.001,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to characterize the frequency, activation, and coreceptor expression of lymphocytes in Chinese human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infected patients, and to study the impact of HCV on immune status and disease progression of HIV infection. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the numbers of T cells and NK cells, the level of activation and the coreceptors of T lymphocytes in different disease stages among 110 HIV/HCV co-infected and 101 HIV mono-infected patients. With disease progression, co-infected patients expressed lower numbers of CD4 T-cells and NK cells, and higher activation levels and coreceptor expression of T lymphocytes. Compared to the counts of HIV mono-infected patients, the NK cell counts of co-infected patients were significantly lower in the asymptomatic HIV-infected and AIDS groups, and the levels of HLA-DR and CXCR4 were significantly elevated in the AIDS group. The viral load of HIV and HCV in the co-infected group increased gradually with the progression of disease. With disease progression, the immune status of HIV/HCV co-infected patients decreased gradually, and the HIV viral load increased. HCV appears to accelerate the natural course of the HIV disease by damaging the innate immune function and aggravating the levels of activating markers and coreceptors on T lymphocytes in co-infected patients."
5880,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to examine the relationships among diarrhea, CD4+ cell counts and opportunistic protozoa in HIV-infected patients in North India. In a retrospective study, blood and stool samples of 200 HIV-infected patients from March 2001 until 2003, submitted to the AIDS division of National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), were analyzed. Each patient was examined for opportunistic protozoa, HIV-1 status and CD4+ cell counts, and screened for diarrheal symptoms. The rate of diarrhea was 38% in the stool examination. In HIV-infected patients in the groups CD4+ > 500 cells/microL, 200 cells/microL < CD4+ < 500 cells/muL and in the AIDS patients CD4+ < 200 cells/microL, diarrhea was 14.7, 29.8 and 56.1%, respectively. It is clear that the diarrhea in the AIDS patients was significant compared with the two former groups (P < 0.0005). In the AIDS patients CD4+ < 200 cells/microL with diarrhea, Cryptosporidium infection was, at 56.5%, the highest and statistically significant compared with the other parasites (P = 0.037). Microsporidium was detected in 30.4% of the AIDS patients. Diarrhea was common and most strongly associated in patients with low CD4+ cell counts. The data stress the importance of opportunistic protozoa in the HIV-infected patients, and that opportunistic protozoa should be expected in HIV-infected patients with low CD4+ and diarrhea."
1502,0.001,1.0000,"The risk of mycobacterial disease is significantly increased in drug abusers as well as in immunocompromised HIV-1-infected individuals. The essential trace element selenium has an important function in maintaining immune processes and may, thus, have a critical role in clearance of mycobacteria. The impact of selenium status on the development of mycobacterial diseases in HIV-1-seropositive drug users was investigated over a 2-year period (1999-2001). Twelve cases of mycobacterial disease (tuberculosis, 9; infection due to atypical Mycobacterium species, 3) occurred; these 12 cases were compared with 32 controls with no history of respiratory infections who were matched on age, sex, and HIV status. Significant risk for development of mycobacterial disease was associated with a CD4 cell count of <200/mm 3, malnutrition, and selenium levels of <or=135 microg/L (patients with these levels were 13 times more likely to develop mycobacterial disease). Multivariate analyses controlling for antiretroviral treatment and CD4 cell count revealed that both body mass index and selenium level remained significant factors in the relative risk for developing mycobacterial disease (relative risk, 3; p =.015); these findings suggest that selenium status may have a profound impact on the pathogenesis of mycobacterial disease."
3539,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 DNA and RNA levels and T lymphocyte cell surface markers were measured in blood serum and cell fractions from asymptomatic infected patients to find novel virologic and immunologic features in early disease predictive of subsequent clinical disease course. Thirty-two patients with rapid disease progression (rapid CD4+ cell loss and progression to clinical AIDS) were compared with 25 patients with stable infections (constant or rising CD4+ cell counts, no clinical disease manifestations). All HIV-1 burdens measured by polymerase chain reaction were consistently higher in specimens from rapid progressors than slow progressors. For each patient, virus burden remained relatively constant throughout the study period (mean, 42-44 months). Flow cytometry also disclosed stable lymphocyte immunophenotype patterns that correlated strongly with subsequent rapid progression to clinical disease. Thus, in early HIV-1 infection, a constellation of high virus burden and in vivo costimulatory antigen and lymphocyte activation abnormalities is predictive of rapid disease course."
1505,0.001,1.0000,"Chemokine receptors serve as coreceptors for HIV-1 entry into CD4(+) T cells. Several reports have mentioned that density of CCR5 expression modulates in vitro viral replication and in vivo the course of the disease. Our goal was to investigate the impact of coreceptor density at the surface of a CD4(+) cell line on HIV-1 entry, replication, spreading, and programmed cell death. We engineered a CEM cell line that expresses constitutively CD4 and CXCR4 and CCR5 after transfection. This model allows us to compare the effect of the X4 and R5 strains to induce T cell death in the same T cell host. We show here that the extent of T cell death correlates with the rate of virus replication. X4 induces faster T cell death than R5 that depends at least in part on the higher density of CXCR4 compared to CCR5. Furthermore, sorting CEM populations expressing low, intermediate, and high densities of CCR5 molecules but constant amount of CD4, we found that the capacity to induce T cell death depends at least in part on the level of CCR5 when low amount of virus was used to infect the CEM cells. Moreover, viral transcription, assessed by cell-associated HIV-1 RNA/DNA ratio, was increased in CCR5high as compared to CCR5low cells, while inhibition of replication by zidovudine was more effective in CCR5low cells. Our data indicate that the density of chemokine receptors expressed on CD4(+) T cells may be a critical parameters for the cytopathic effect of HIV strains and may have major impact on CD4 T cell depletion during HAART."
3462,0.001,1.0000,"We aimed to investigate whether the character of the immunodominant HIV-Gag peptide (variable or conserved) targeted by CD8(+) T cells in early HIV infection would influence the quality and quantity of T cell responses, and whether this would affect the rate of disease progression. Treatment-naive HIV-infected study subjects within the OPTIONS cohort at the University of California, San Francisco, were monitored from an estimated 44 days postinfection for up to 6 years. CD8(+) T cells responses targeting HLA-matched HIV-Gag-epitopes were identified and characterized by multicolor flow cytometry. The autologous HIV gag sequences were obtained. We demonstrate that patients targeting a conserved HIV-Gag-epitope in early infection maintained their epitope-specific CD8(+) T cell response throughout the study period. Patients targeting a variable epitope showed decreased immune responses over time, although there was no limitation of the functional profile, and they were likely to target additional variable epitopes. Maintained immune responses to conserved epitopes were associated with no or limited sequence evolution within the targeted epitope. Patients with immune responses targeting conserved epitopes had a significantly lower median viral load over time compared to patients with responses targeting a variable epitope (0.63 log(10) difference). Furthermore, the rate of CD4(+) T cell decline was slower for subjects targeting a conserved epitope (0.85% per month) compared to subjects targeting a variable epitope (1.85% per month). Previous studies have shown that targeting of antigens based on specific HLA types is associated with a better disease course. In this study we show that categorizing epitopes based on their variability is associated with clinical outcome."
1817,0.001,1.0000,"The frequency of CCR5-Delta32 allele in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the southern Brazilian population was determined in a cross-sectional study carried out from October 2001 to June 2004. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells of 134 healthy blood donors, 145 HIV-1-exposed seronegative individuals, 152 HIV-1-seropositive asymptomatic individuals, and 478 HIV-1-seropositive individuals with AIDS. A fragment with 225 base-pairs of the CCR5 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The CCR5-Delta32 homozygous deletion was observed in 2 (1.5%) blood donors and in 1 (0.7%) individual HIV-1-exposed seronegative, and was absent among all the HIV-1-seropositive individuals (Fisher's exact test, p=0.0242). The frequency of the homozygous CCR5-Delta32 deletion in the HIV-1-exposed did not differ when compared with that observed in the HIV-1 seronegative blood donors (Fisher's exact test, p=0.6093; OR: 2.18, 95% CI: 0.11-129.6). The wild-type genotype CCR5/CCR5 frequency was higher among the HIV-1-seropositive with AIDS compared to HIV-1 seropositive asymptomatic individuals (Chi-square test, p=0.0263; OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.03-3.97). The absence of the homozygous deletion of CCR5-Delta32 among HIV-1-seropositive individuals underscored that this genotype is an important genetic factor associated with the decreased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. The higher frequency of heterozygosity for the CCR5-Delta32 and the CCR5-Delta32 allele in HIV-1 seropositive asymptomatic compared to HIV-seropositive with AIDS individuals also underscored that this deletion could be associated with the delay of the HIV-1 disease progression in this population. However, the low frequency of CCR5-Delta32 homozygosity observed among HIV-1-exposed seronegative individuals shows that the allele could not explain, by itself, the natural resistance to HIV-1 infection and different mechanisms of protection against HIV-1 infection that must be involved in this population."
8080,0.001,1.0000,"The clinical course and outcome of HIV-1 infection are highly variable among individuals. Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a key T helper 2 cytokine with various immune-modulating functions including induction of immunoglobulin E (IgE) production in B cells, downregulation of CCR5 and upregulation of CXCR4, the main co-receptors for HIV. Our objective is to investigate whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-4 promoter 589 C/T and IL-4 Ralpha I50V affect the susceptibility to HIV infection and its progression to AIDS in North Indian individuals. The study population consisted of 180 HIV-1 seropositive (HSP) stratified on the basis of disease severity (stage I, II, III), 50 HIV-1 exposed seronegative (HES), and 305 HIV-1 seronegative (HSN) individuals. The subjects were genotyped for IL-4 589 C/T promoter polymorphism and IL-4 Ralpha I50V by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism. The results showed that IL-4 589 C/T was not associated with the risk of HIV infection and disease progression. However, the IL-4Ralpha I50 allele and genotype was significantly increased in HSP compared to HSN and HSP and was associated with risk of HIV infection. The frequency of IL-4Ralpha I50 allele in the HSP group was higher than in HSN (76.11 vs. 64.75%; P = 0.000; OR = 1.734) and HES (76.11% vs. 62.00%; P = 0.007; OR = 1.953). Homozygous IL-4Ralpha I50I genotype was significantly increased in HSP group compared with HSN (58.88% vs. 44.26%; P = 0.002; OR = 1.804) and HES (58.88% vs. 42.00%; P = 0.038; OR = 1.978). The present study for the first time suggests an association of IL-4Ralpha I50 allele with increased likelihood of HIV-1 infection in North Indian population. Further studies are required to confirm these findings and understand the effect of IL-4Ralpha polymorphism on the outcome of HIV-1 infection."
897,0.001,1.0000,"Pigtail macaques (PTM) are an excellent model for HIV research; however, the dynamics of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) SIVmac239 infection in PTM have not been fully evaluated. We studied nine PTM prior to infection, during acute and chronic SIVmac239 infections, until progression to AIDS. We found PTM manifest clinical AIDS more rapidly than rhesus macaques (RM), as AIDS-defining events occurred at an average of 42.17 weeks after infection in PTM compared to 69.56 weeks in RM (P = 0.0018). However, increased SIV progression was not associated with increased viremia, as both peak and set-point plasma viremias were similar between PTM and RM (P = 0.7953 and P = 0.1006, respectively). Moreover, this increased disease progression was not associated with rapid CD4(+) T cell depletion, as CD4(+) T cell decline resembled other SIV/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) models. Since immune activation is the best predictor of disease progression during HIV infection, we analyzed immune activation by turnover of T cells by BrdU decay and Ki67 expression. We found increased levels of turnover prior to SIV infection of PTM compared to that observed with RM, which may contribute to their increased disease progression rate. These data evaluate the kinetics of SIVmac239-induced disease progression and highlight PTM as a model for HIV infection and the importance of immune activation in SIV disease progression."
3654,0.001,1.0000,"The effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on liver function and viral load of hepatitis C virus (HCV) was studied in 21 hemophilic men coinfected with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction was measured by branched DNA Quantiplex assay on frozen plasma samples obtained at baseline and at 24, 48, and 96 weeks after initiation of HAART. HCV RNA increased at 48 and 96 weeks after initiation of HAART therapy (198x105 Eq/mL [P=.03] and 227x105 Eq/mL [P<.0001], respectively, compared with baseline [141x105 Eq/mL]). This increase was associated with an increase in CD4 cell count and reduction in HIV viral load but no change in hepatic transaminases. With discontinuation of HAART, HCV RNA decreased as HIV RNA rebounded. Further study is required to clarify the histopathologic significance of this finding."
9555,0.001,1.0000,"In an urban community in Guinea-Bissau, we followed a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) seropositive individuals (N = 47) and seronegative controls (N = 82). T-lymphocyte subset determinations were done in 1988, 1990, and 1992. Serial determinations of CD4 percentages, CD8 percentages, and CD4/CD8 ratios for the same individual were stable for 31 seropositive and 51 seronegative individuals with repeated measurements. We found no significant differences in the changes during a 2- or 4-year period in CD4 percentages, CD8 percentages, absolute CD8 T-lymphocyte counts, CD4/CD8 ratio, white blood cell counts, lymphocyte percentages, and absolute lymphocyte counts for HIV-2-seropositive compared with HIV-2-seronegative individuals. Only absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts changed more for the HIV-2-seropositive than for HIV-2-seronegative individuals (p = 0.037). HIV-2-infected individuals who lived with an HIV-2-infected spouse had a lower CD4/CD8 ratio and had higher mortality than HIV-2 infected individuals who lived with an uninfected spouse. However, there were no significant differences in immunological and hematological values for the 8 HIV-2 seropositive individuals who died and the 39 who survived in the 8-year follow-up period. In conclusion, progression of immunosuppression in HIV-2 infection seems to be slower than in HIV-1 infection and may not be inevitable in all individuals."
9612,0.001,1.0000,"Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NNRTIs) are important components of current combination therapies for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. In screening of chemical libraries, we found 6-azido-1-benzyl-3-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)uracil (AzBBU) and 6-amino-1-benzyl-3-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)uracil (AmBBU) to be highly active and selective inhibitors of HIV-1 replication in vitro. To determine the resistance profiles of these compounds, we conducted a long-term culture of HIV-1-infected MT-4 cells with escalating concentrations of each compound. After serial passages of the infected cells, escape viruses were obtained, and they were more than 500-fold resistant to the uracil derivatives compared to the wild type. Sequence analysis was conducted for RT of the escape viruses at passages 12 and 24. The amino acid mutation Y181C in the polymerase domain of RT was detected for all escape viruses. Docking studies using the crystal structure of RT showed that AmBBU requires the amino acid residues Leu100, Val106, Tyr181, and Trp229 for exerting its inhibitory effect on HIV-1. Four additional amino acid changes (K451R, R461K, T468P, and D471N) were identified in the RNase H domain of RT; however, their precise role in the acquisition of resistance is still unclear. In conclusion, the initial mutation Y181C seems sufficient for the acquisition of resistance to the uracil derivatives AzBBU and AmBBU. Further studies are required to determine the precise role of each mutation in the acquisition of HIV-1 resistance."
8979,0.001,1.0000,"In comparison with other Canadian provinces and most Western countries, the province of Manitoba maintains a different vaccination policy for hepatitis B. This policy provides selective antenatal screening for hepatitis B in women and an inoculation program for hepatitis B vaccination for fourth-grade pupils. There has been increasing concern for this policy with regard to its influence on secular trends of acute hepatitis B incidence in Manitoba. This created a need to summarise the epidemiological characteristics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Manitoba and to allocate finances and human resources for future prevention programs. The Cadham Provincial Laboratory in Winnipeg, a Canadian Public Health Laboratory, is responsible for testing all specimens for diagnosis of various common infectious diseases in Manitoba. During the period from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 2003, a total of 285,946 clinical specimens were submitted to this laboratory, which confirmed 310 cases of acute HBV and 7,556 cases of chronic HBV infection. A total of 18,168 individuals were identified as having vaccine-induced immune status. The incidence rate of acute HBV infection has significantly decreased from 6.52/100,000 person-years in 1996 to 0.86/100,000 person-years in 2003. Annual prevalence rates of chronic HBV infection in Manitoba increased slightly from 42.96 cases/100,000 population in 1992 to 71.47 cases/100,000 population in 2003. Incidence rates were generally higher in men than in women at all age groups, with values of 2.65 and 1.65 per 100,000 population, respectively (chi-square=15.768, p value <0.001). The highest incidence rate for both males and females was observed in the age group 30-34 years. The North Eastman and Winnipeg Regional Health Authorities showed significantly higher incidence rates of acute hepatitis B compared with the other nine Regional Health Authorities. Selective hepatitis B vaccination programs for children in Manitoba had achieved the greatest success in the prevention of vertical and horizontal transmission. There is an urgent need to develop cost-effective harm-reduction strategies for hepatitis B prevention among adults (aged 30-34) and groups at risk in Manitoba."
3196,0.001,1.0000,"Immune function was observed for 144 weeks in 643 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects who (1) had nadir CD4+ cell counts of <50 cells/mm3, followed by a sustained increase to > or =100 cells/mm3 after the initiation of HAART, and (2) were enrolled in a randomized trial of continued azithromycin prophylaxis versus withdrawal for prevention of Mycobacterium avium complex disease. The median CD4+ cell count was 226 cells/mm3 at entry and 358 cells/mm3 at week 144. Anergy (80.2% of patients) and lack of lymphoproliferative response to tetanus toxoid (TT; 73%) after immunization and impaired antibody responses after receipt of hepatitis A (54%) and TT (86%) vaccines were considered to be evidence of impaired immune reconstitution. Receipt of azithromycin did not have an effect on CD4+ cell count but was associated with higher rates of delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to TT (25% of subjects who received azithromycin vs. 15% of those who did not; P=.009) and mumps skin test antigen (29% vs. 17%; P=.001). Although the subjects had only partial responses to immune function testing, the rate of opportunistic infections was very low, and none of the tests was predictive of risk."
2427,0.001,1.0000,"Fibronectin (FN) is a high molecular weight extracellular matrix protein that functions in cell adhesion, growth, migration, and embryonic development. However, little is known about the role of FN during viral infection. In the present study, we found significantly higher levels of FN in sera, and liver tissues from hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients relative to healthy individuals. HBV expression enhanced FN mRNA and protein levels in the hepatic cell lines Huh7 and HepG2. HBV infection of susceptible HepG2-sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide cells also increased FN expression. We also found that transcriptional factor specificity protein 1 was involved in the induction of FN by HBV. Knockdown of FN expression significantly inhibited HBV DNA replication and protein synthesis through activating endogenous IFN-α production. In addition, FN interacted with the transforming growth factor β-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1) and TAK1-binding protein complex and attenuated interferon signaling by inhibiting TAK1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the nuclear translocation of NF-κB/p65 was found to be inhibited by FN. We also observed that FN promoted HBV enhancers to support HBV expression. These results suggest novel functions of endogenous FN involved in immune evasion and maintenance of HBV replication. "
7254,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to assess the degree of implementation of national guidelines for isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and factors affecting the impact of the programme. Twenty-eight infectious disease hospital units in Italy participated in this observational, multicentre, prospective cohort study. A number of HIV-infected subjects, (n=1,705) seen for the first time as outpatients, were included in this analysis. Of the subjects considered, 1,215 out of the 1,705 completed purified protein derivative (PPD) screening. Variables independently associated with offering and completion of PPD screening included having acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), higher educational levels and currently receiving therapy. Overall, 103 subjects were identified as candidates for IPT. Of these subjects, five had tuberculosis and 15 had contraindications to IPT. Forty subjects agreed to start IPT, and 29 completed a full-course regimen. The incidence of tuberculosis among IPT candidates who either did not begin or discontinued IPT was 6.1 per 100 person-yrs, while no cases of tuberculosis were observed in subjects completing IPT. Several factors may limit the implementation of an isoniazid preventive therapy programme for human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons. Physicians fail to offer purified protein derivative screening to patients with high degrees of immunodeficiency, and those with a more intense workload seem to pay less attention to this test. The high number of contraindications among patients and their low level of acceptance further affects the impact of isoniazid preventive therapy."

The degree of HBV variability in liver vs peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients on long-term suppressive antivirals is unclear. We characterized HBV replication, drug resistance and molecular diversity in patients with plasma HBV DNA undetectable by clinical assays. Explant liver (n=9), PBMC (n=6) and plasma (n=7) from nine such patients undergoing liver transplantation were evaluated for HBV genomes by sensitive PCR/nucleic acid hybridization assay. Cases with HBV DNA in liver and PBMC were tested for covalently closed circular DNA (HBV cccDNA). HBV polymerase (P) amplicons were cloned, sequenced and both P and overlapping surface (S) gene sequences were analysed. HBV DNA was detected in 43% (3/7) of plasma, 100% (9/9) of liver and 83% (5/6) of PBMC samples. HBV cccDNA was detected in all liver and one PBMC sample. Four patients had a clinical diagnosis of resistance. HBV P gene sequencing revealed 100% wild type (wt) in plasma (2/2), 83% wt in PBMC (5/6) but livers of 3/9 (33%) contained wt and 6/9 (66%) carried resistance to lamivudine and/or adefovir. The translated S gene revealed no changes affecting HBV antigenicity. Sequences from livers with antiviral resistant mutants revealed greater interpatient quasispecies diversity. Despite apparent HBV suppression, the liver continues to support HBV replication and extrahepatic HBV can be detected. PBMC may be a sanctuary for wt virus during antiviral therapy, while the liver harbours more drug-resistant viruses. Drug resistance correlates with intrahepatic viral diversity."
3301,0.001,1.0000,"Quantitative PCR assays used to monitor hepatitis B virus (HBV) load differ in their ability to detect different HBV variants. This study evaluated the performance of the Abbott RT PCR assay for quantitating DNA from different HBV genotypes and from HBV variants bearing HBsAg gene mutations. The study was performed on a randomly-selected sample with a viral load >6logIU/mL for each genotype and on 25 HBsAg variants. Each sample was assayed using the Abbott RT assay and with the Roche Cobas AmpliPrep-Cobas TaqMan as a reference method. All HBV genotypes were detected with the Abbott RT assay with an equivalent dynamic range (1-8logIU/mL). For each genotype, the data suggest that the assay was linear over the entire dilution range (r(2): 0.985-0.995). For the 25 HBsAg variants, viral titres determined with the two assays correlated well (r(2): 0.929). The mean difference between the two methods was -0.295 (95% CI: -0.520 to -0.071). The difference was lower than 1log unit in all but two cases. In conclusion, the Abbott RT assay can detect and quantify DNA from different HBV variants with equivalent performance and is thus suitable for routine monitoring of patients with chronic HBV infections."
8908,0.001,1.0000,"Following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration into host cell DNA, the viral promoter can become transcriptionally silent in the absence of appropriate signals and factors. HIV-1 gene expression is dependent on regulatory elements contained within the long terminal repeat (LTR) that drive the synthesis of viral RNAs and proteins through interaction with multiple host and viral factors. Previous studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and Sp site III (3T, C-to-T change at position 3, and 5T, C-to-T change at position 5 of the binding site, respectively, when compared to the consensus B sequence) that are low affinity binding sites and correlate with more advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. Stably transfected cell lines containing the wild type, 3T, 5T, and 3T5T LTRs were developed utilizing bone marrow progenitor, T, and monocytic cell lines to explore the LTR phenotypes associated with these genotypic changes from an integrated chromatin-based microenvironment. Results suggest that in nonexpressing cell clones LTR-driven gene expression occurs in a SNP-specific manner in response to LTR activation or treatment with trichostatin A treatment, indicating a possible cell type and SNP-specific mechanism behind the epigenetic control of LTR activation.

2848,0.001,1.0000,"A novel technology combining replication- and integration-defective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vectors with genetically modified dendritic cells was developed in order to induce T-cell immunity. We introduced the vector into dendritic cells as a plasmid DNA using polyethylenimine as the gene delivery system, thereby circumventing the problem of obtaining viral vector expression in the absence of integration. Genetically modified dendritic cells (GMDC) presented viral epitopes efficiently, secreted interleukin 12, and primed both CD4(+) and CD8(+) HIV-specific T cells capable of producing gamma interferon and exerting potent HIV-1-specific cytotoxicity in vitro. In nonhuman primates, subcutaneously injected GMDC migrated into the draining lymph node at an unprecedentedly high rate and expressed the plasmid DNA. The animals presented a vigorous HIV-specific effector cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte (CTL) response as early as 3 weeks after a single immunization, which later developed into a memory CTL response. Interestingly, antibodies did not accompany these CTL responses, indicating that GMDC can induce a pure Th1 type of immune response. Successful induction of a broad and long-lasting HIV-specific cellular immunity is expected to control virus replication in infected individuals."
6898,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a global health threat as chronic HBV infection may lead to liver cirrhosis or cancer. Current antiviral therapies with nucleoside analogues can inhibit the replication of HBV, but do not disrupt the already existing HBV covalently closed circular DNA. The newly developed CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated 9) system is a powerful tool to target cellular genome DNA for gene editing. In order to investigate the possibility of using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to disrupt the HBV DNA templates, we designed eight guide RNAs (gRNAs) that targeted the conserved regions of different HBV genotypes, which could significantly inhibit HBV replication both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the HBV-specific gRNA/Cas9 system could inhibit the replication of HBV of different genotypes in cells, and the viral DNA was significantly reduced by a single gRNA/Cas9 system and cleared by a combination of different gRNA/Cas9 systems.

4587,0.001,1.0000,"Despite recent advances in the chemotherapy of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), an effective viral suppression after cessation of therapy has not yet been achieved. To investigate whether hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific T-cell responses are inducible and can contribute to the viral suppression after cessation of the therapy, we conducted a proof-of-concept study with a DNA vaccine comprising of most HBV genes plus genetically engineered interleukin-12 DNA (IL-12N222L) in 12 CHB carriers being treated with lamivudine (LAM). When the ex vivo and/or cultured IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay was performed, the detectable HBV-specific IFN-gamma secreting T-cell responses were observed at the end of treatment and during a follow-up. These type 1T-cell responses, particularly CD4(+) memory T-cell responses could be maintained for at least 40 weeks after the therapy and correlated with virological responses, but not with alanine aminotransferase elevation. Moreover, DNA vaccination under LAM treatment appeared to be well-tolerated and showed 50% of virological response rate in CHB carriers. Thus, a combination therapy of the DNA vaccine with chemotherapy may be one of new immunotherapeutic methods for the cure of CHB."
5255,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1 infection and compartmentalization in diverse leukocyte targets significantly contribute to viral persistence during suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Longitudinal analyses were performed on envelope sequences of HIV-1 populations from plasma, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 14 patients receiving HAART and 1 therapy-naive individual. Phylogenetic reconstructions and analysis of molecular variance revealed that HIV-1 populations in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells remained compartmentalized over time in most individuals. Analyses of viral genetic variation demonstrated that, despite compartmentalization remaining over time, viral subpopulations tended not to persist and evolve but instead broke down and became reconstituted by new founder viruses. Due to the profound impact of HAART on viral evolution, it was difficult to discern whether these dynamics were ongoing during treatment or predominantly established prior to the commencement of therapy. The genetic structure and viral founder effects observed in serially sampled T lymphocyte populations supported a scenario of metapopulation dynamics in the tissue(s) where different leukocytes become infected, a factor likely to contribute to the highly variable way that drug resistance evolves in different individuals during HAART."
3776,0.001,1.0000,"Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) are the main genes that control cell death in the immune system. Indeed, they are crucial for the regulation of T lymphocyte homeostasis because they can influence cell proliferation. A strong debate exists on the importance of Fas/FasL system during HIV infection, which is characterized by the loss of CD4+ T cells directly, or indirectly, caused by the virus. To investigate whether the genetic background of the host plays a role in the immunoreconstitution, we studied the influence of different Fas and FasL polymorphisms on CD4+ T lymphocyte count and plasma viral load following initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in drug-naïve HIV+ patients. We studied 131 individuals, who were compared to 136 healthy donors. Statistical analysis was performed by using Chi2 test, Fischer's Exact Test, and analysis for repeated measurements. The group of HIV+ patients had an unexpected lower frequency of FasLnt169 polymorphism (delT allele) than healthy controls (p = 0.039). We then observed no significant differences in the immune reconstitution, in terms of CD4+ T cell increase, when the influence of single alleles of the gene Fas or FasL was considered. However, the combination of some polymorphisms of Fas or FasL significantly influenced CD4+ T cell production and viral load decrease, showing that these genes can play a role in the immunoreconstitution triggered by antiretroviral therapy."

5036,0.001,1.0000,"We have described a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) culture system in which control of endogenous virus and resistance to exogenous HIV-1 correlates with low viremia among HIV-1-positive people. Nineteen patients remained consistently resistant or susceptible for more than 5 years of follow-up. On the fifth year, 5 consistently susceptible volunteers with high viral loads began receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). After >6 months on HAART, 5 of 5 became completely or predominantly resistant on four visits over the next 6 months. Among HIV-1-positive donors, we had never observed reversal of PBMC phenotype from consistently susceptible to consistently resistant. Resistance correlated with suppression of plasma viremia and rebound in CD4+ T-cell counts and percentages. When resistant PBMCs were challenged after CD8+ T-cell depletion, 38 of 41 and 40 of 59 cultures became susceptible to HIV-1MN and HIV-1BaL, respectively. After combined CD8+ T-cell depletion and antibody neutralization of beta-chemokines, 16 of 18 cultures became susceptible to HIV-1BaL. Overall, the finding that >90% of these cultures depleted of relevant antiviral effector arms could become infected indicates resistance was not due to residual antiretroviral drug metabolites in vitro. For 2 volunteers who discontinued therapy because of side effects, pretreatment viral load correlated with loss of in vitro resistance and viral rebound. In addition to resistance to laboratory strains of HIV-1, all patients developed resistance to at least one of two CCR5-tropic, clade B primary isolates: HIV-1P15 and HIV-1P27."
5344,0.001,1.0000,"CD4+ T lymphocytes are the primary target of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but there is increasing evidence that other immune cells in the blood, including CD8+ T lymphocytes and monocytes, are also productively infected. The extent to which these additional cellular reservoirs contribute to ongoing immunodeficiency and viral persistence during therapy remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a detailed investigation of HIV-1 diversity and genetic structure in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and monocytes of 13 patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Analysis of molecular variance and nonparametric tests performed on HIV-1 envelope sequences provided statistically significant evidence of viral compartmentalization in different leukocyte populations. Signature pattern analysis and predictions of coreceptor use provided no evidence that selection arising from viral tropism was responsible for the genetic structure observed. Analysis of viral genetic variation in different leukocyte populations demonstrated the action of founder effects as well as significant variation in the extent of genetic differentiation between subpopulations among patients. In the absence of evidence for leukocyte-specific selection, these features were supportive of a metapopulation model of HIV-1 replication as described previously among HIV-1 populations in the spleen. Compartmentalization of the virus in different leukocytes may have significant implications for current models of HIV-1 population genetics and contribute to the highly variable way in which drug resistance evolves in different individuals during HAART."
2295,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered to be the most important target for the diagnosis and immune prophylaxis of HBV infection. HBsAg-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are extensively used for studying the complex structure of the HBsAg, mapping the neutralizing epitopes and development of HBV diagnostic tests. However, the efficiency of anti-HBV binding strongly depends on the epitope structure and MAb capability to recognize different HBV variants. In the current study, 9 MAbs against yeast-expressed HBsAg of ayw2 serotype were generated and 7 of them were shown to recognize a linear epitope comprising amino acid (aa) residues 119-GPCRTCT-125 within the main antigenic ""a"" determinant of HBsAg. One MAb of the highest affinity (clone HB1) was selected for detailed cross-reactivity studies, generation of recombinant single-chain antibody (scFv) and molecular modelling of antibody-epitope interaction. The importance of each aa residue within the identified MAb epitope was determined by alanine substitution study that revealed aa residues C(121), T(123), C(124) and T(125) as essential for binding. These aa residues are highly conserved among HBV variants. In contrast, alanine substitution of G119, P120 and R122 had no or minor influence on the reactivity with the MAb. Certain aa residues at position 122 (either R or K) define different HBV serotypes (either d or y), therefore, the affinity of the MAb HB1 for the epitope with R122K substitution was determined to evaluate its diagnostic potential. The MAb recognized both epitope variants with high affinity. Sequence alignment of the MAb epitope within different HBV strains demonstrated that the shortest peptide recognized by the MAb 121-CR(K)TCT-125 is identical among different human HBV genotypes (HBV A-F, H) and monkey HBV species (HBVCP, HBVGO, HBVGB, WMHBV). In line with these data, the MAb HB1 was cross-reactive in Western blot with a large panel of antigens derived from different HBV genotypes. Recombinant scFv consisting of immunoglobulin VH and VL regions joined by a 20 aa-long linker was generated by cloning the respective cDNA sequences from hybridoma HB1. The recombinant scFv generated in Escherichia coli recognized the same epitope as the parental MAb HB1. Cloning of HB1 VH and VL regions allowed determination of their primary structure and subsequent computer modeling of antibody-epitope interaction. The generated molecular models of HB1 variable region with its target peptides were in accordance with experimental data showing the importance of certain aa residues in antibody binding. In conclusion, the current study describes new HBsAg-specific antibodies with HBV-neutralizing potency and a broad cross-reactivity against different HBV strains. The generated MAb HB1 will be of great value in diagnostic and research settings, while the recombinant HB1-derived scFv represents a promising ""building block"" for producing anti-HBV tools with a potential biopharmaceutical application.

413,0.001,1.0000,"The present study evaluated several techniques currently available (commercial kits and in-house assays) for diagnosing human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 in two groups of patients enrolled at HIV/AIDS specialized care services in São Paulo: Group 1 (G1), n=1608, 1237 male/371 female, median age 44.3 years old, majority using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART); G2, n=1383, 930 male/453 female, median age of 35.6 years old, majority HAART naïve. Enzyme immunoassays [(EIA) Murex and Gold ELISA] were employed for human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 screening; Western blotting (WB), INNO-LIA (LIA), real-time PCR pol (qPCR), and nested-PCR-RFLP (tax) were used to confirm infection. Samples were considered human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 positive when there was reactivity using at least one of the four confirmatory assays. By serological screening, 127/2991 samples were positive or borderline, and human T lymphotropic virus infection was confirmed in 108 samples (three EIA-borderline): 56 human T lymphotropic virus type 1 [G1 (27)+G2 (29)]; 45 human T lymphotropic virus type 2 [G1 (21)+G2 (24)]; one human T lymphotropic virus type 1+human T lymphotropic virus type 2 (G2); six human T lymphotropic virus [G1 (2)+G2 (4)]. Although there were differences in group characteristics, human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 prevalence was similar [3.1% (G1) and 4.2% (G2), p=0.113]. The overall sensitivities of LIA, WB, qPCR, and PCR-RFLP were 97.2%, 82.4%, 68.9%, and 68.4%, respectively, with some differences among groups, likely due to the stage of human T lymphotropic virus infection and/or HAART duration. Indeterminate immunoblotting results were detected in G2, possibly due to the seroconversion period. Negative results in molecular assays could be explained by the use of HAART, the occurrence of defective provirus and/or the low circulating proviral load. In conclusion, when determining the human T lymphotropic virus infection, the findings highlight that there is a need to consider the blood samples with borderline results in screening assays. Of all the tested assays, LIA was the assay of choice for detecting human T lymphotropic virus type 1 and human T lymphotropic virus type 2 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected patients."
9489,0.001,1.0000,"Cellular immune responses to hepatitis B virus (HBV) play an important role in the resolution of acute infection. They also influence the course of chronic infection and disease but are inadequate to completely clear the infection. Woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection of the woodchuck can provide a model to study these processes. Lymphocyte responses of woodchucks were assessed by in vitro proliferation and/or interleukin (IL)-2 assays using mitogen (Concanavalin A [ConA]), cytokine (IL-2), superantigen (Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B [SEB]), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allo-antigen (mixed lymphocyte reaction [MLR]), and viral antigens (woodchuck hepatitis virus core antigen [WHcAg] and woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen [WHsAg]). ConA-stimulated woodchuck lymphocytes underwent cell division based on cell counting experiments and produced IL-2 as detected using an IL-2-dependent murine cell line but failed to incorporate sufficient tritiated thymidine; however, they did incorporate sufficient tritiated adenosine and deoxyadenosine to permit development of a meaningful proliferation assay. The IL-2 assay was sensitive and specific for detection of woodchuck IL-2 induced by mitogen, superantigen, and MLR, as shown by quantitative titration analysis and anti-body neutralization of ConA-supernatant activity. Cyclosporin A and FK506 specifically inhibited ConA- and SEB-induced IL-2 production by woodchuck lymphocytes. Positive two-way MLRs were detected by IL-2 production and proliferation assay between woodchucks from different geographic regions, thus indicating divergence among MHC molecules; however, occasional negative MLR reactions among indigenous pairs of woodchucks indicated that some woodchucks were mutually immunocompatible to some degree. The radioadenosine proliferation assay was sensitive for detecting peripheral blood lymphocyte responses to WHcAg and WHsAg in adult woodchucks with recently resolved acute infections. The above systems should facilitate the design of adoptive therapy and liver transplantation experiments in the woodchuck, and also enable modeling of immune responses that promote and maintain chronic hepadnavirus infection."

According to therapy status, the patients were divided into two groups: group A consisted of 76 patients undergoing chemotherapy and group B of 64 patients in complete remission and off treatment. The eligibility requirements were negative hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, and human immunodeficiency virus serologic markers. A total of four dose (20 micrograms per dose) of recombinant HB vaccine was administered intramuscularly in the deltoid region at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months. Blood from the vaccinated subjects was obtained at months 1, 2, 3, and 7 in order to measure anti-HBs titer levels. Protective anti-HBs titers were considered to be those > or = 10 mIU/mL. The overall seroconversion rate 1 month after the fourth dose was 57% (80/140 patients), and the seroconversion rates for groups A and B were 31.5% (24/76 patients) and 87.5% (56/64 patients), respectively. Our results indicated that immunocompromised children undergoing chemotherapy (although less responsive than children in complete remission and off treatment) still preserved their potential to produce protective titers of anti-HBs. On this basis we recommend (1) HB vaccination after diagnosis of malignancy in pediatric patients whenever a high prevalence of HB infection exists and (2) vaccination of patients of therapy and in complete remission."
1265,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) terminates plus-strand DNA synthesis at the center of the HIV-1 genome, a process important for HIV-1 infectivity. The central termination sequence contains two termination sites (Ter1 and Ter2) located at the 3'-end of A(n)T(m) motifs, and the narrowing of the DNA minor groove generated by these motifs is responsible for termination. Kinetic data associated with the binding of RT and its ability to elongate in vitro various DNA duplexes and triplexes surrounding the Ter2 terminator were analyzed using a simple kinetic scheme. At Ter2, RT still displays a reasonable affinity for the corresponding DNA, but the binding of the next nucleotide and above all its incorporation rate are markedly hampered. Features affecting the width of the minor groove act directly at this last step. The constraint exerted against elongation by the A(n)T(m) tract persists at two positions downstream of the terminator."
8097,0.001,1.0000,"The nucleocapsid protein NCp7 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a 72-amino-acid peptide containing two CCHC-type zinc fingers linked by a short basic sequence, 29RAPRKKG35, which is conserved in HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus. The complete three-dimensional structure of NCp7 has been determined by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (N. Morellet, H. de Rocquigny, Y. Mely, N. Jullian, H. Demene, M. Ottmann, D. Gerard, J. L. Darlix, M. C. Fournié-Zaluski, and B. P. Roques, J. Mol. Biol. 235:287-301, 1994) and revealed a central globular domain where the two zinc fingers are brought in close proximity by the RAPRKKG linker. To examine the role of this globular structure and more precisely of the RAPRKKG linker in virion structure and infectivity, we generated HIV-1 DNA mutants in the RAPRKK sequence of NCp7 and analyzed the mutant virions produced by transfected cells. Mutations that probably alter the structure of NCp7 structure led to the formation of very poorly infectious virus (A30P) or noninfectious virus (P31L and R32G). In addition, the P31L mutant did not contain detectable amounts of reverse transcriptase and had an immature core morphology, as determined by electron microscopy. On the other hand, mutations changing the basic nature of NCp7 had poor effect. R29S had a wild-type phenotype, and the replacement of 32RKK34 by SSS (S3 mutant) resulted in a decrease by no more than 100-fold of the virus titer. These results clearly show that the RAPRKKG linker contains residues that are critical for virion structure and infectivity."
5207,0.001,1.0000,"The genetic basis for didanosine (ddl) resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) has previously been shown to be commonly associated with a Leu to Val change at codon 74 in the HIV-1 RT gene. In this study sequential viral isolates were analyzed from five patients with prior zidovudine (AZT) use who received 6 to 16 months of ddl therapy. Following ddl therapy, viral isolates exhibited an increased AZT susceptibility and decreased ddl susceptibility. Sequence and nested PCR analysis of the HIV-1 RT gene revealed that two viral isolates contained the Leu to Val change at codon 74, and three other isolates with reduced susceptibility to ddl each contained changes at codons 65, 70, and 72. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to insert specific mutations in RT gene of proviral clone pNL4-3. Analysis of virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity indicated that the Lys70Arg mutation resulted in an enzyme with 2- to 4-fold decreased susceptibility to ddATP. Statistical analysis of the inhibitory concentration for RT activity between pNL4-3 and mutant Lys70Arg viruses obtained in three independent RT inhibition assays was significant (P = 0.05) by student t test paired analysis. Drug susceptibility assays on the virus with Lys70Arg mutation showed a marginal decrease in susceptibility to ddl (1.5- to 2-fold) and about 4- to 6-fold decrease in susceptibility to AZT. Mutations Lys65Glu and Arg72Ser resulted in an impaired RT with greatly diminished functional RT activity. The AZT-associated Lys70Arg mutation results in an RT enzyme with decreased susceptibility to ddATP."

2171,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus infected persons are usually identified by indirect methods, detecting viral-specific antibodies. Helping the early diagnosis of HIV infection there is a need to detect virus or viral specific antigens directly. Virus isolation have been attempted from separated lymphocytes of HIV infected five homosexual male patients and one transfusion recipient. Three patients had AIDS, three belonged to the ARC group at the time of the examination. In 3 out of 6 lymphocyte cultures cocultivated with normal donor lymphocytes, virus antigens and virus replications had been detected within ten days of culture. The amount of HIV antigen p24 ranged between 0.5----2.0 ng/ml during the first two weeks of cocultivation. Permanent human lymphoid and monocyte/macrophage cell lines have been infected by the viruses isolated from the primer lymphocyte cocultures. Productive infection could be initiated in Jurkat tat-III and U937 cells, while infection of Jurkat and HUT 78 cell lines was transient.

9902,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) p24 antigen, a putative marker of virus load, was assayed in 79 blood and 83 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 90 HIV-1-seropositive individuals with or without dementia. Twenty-eight subjects had no evidence of neuropsychological impairment, 17 had mild impairment without objective evidence of dementia, and 45 were demented. HIV-1 p24 antigen was detected more frequently in CSF samples from demented (19/40) than normal (1/26) or mildly impaired (1/17) subjects and in 67% of individuals with significant dementia (MSK stages 2-4). p24 Antigen was detected less frequently in CSF from demented subjects on antiretroviral drugs than untreated demented individuals. Overall, the sensitivity of the antigen capture assay in CSF among demented individuals was 47.5%; the specificity, 95.0%; positive predictive value, 90.4%; negative predictive value, 66.1%; and the efficiency, 72.2%. A direct relationship was also noted between the degree of cognitive impairment and blood p24 antigen detection frequency and antigen concentration. CD4+ blood lymphocyte counts were lower for demented individuals, and HIV-1 p24 antigen was detected more frequently and p24 antigen concentration was higher in blood and CSF from individuals with low CD4+ blood lymphocyte counts. beta 2-Microglobulin levels were higher in CSF from demented subjects and correlated directly with CSF p24 antigen concentration. However, in contrast to CD4+ blood lymphocyte counts and beta 2-microglobulin levels, only p24 antigen concentration correlated with dementia severity. Therefore, p24 antigen can be a useful marker for dementia related to HIV-1 infection."
9492,0.001,1.0000,"In 32 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women, routine gynecologic examination was performed with colposcopy and Papanicolaou smear; cervical swabs were collected for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA screening and typing; and immune status was assessed by CD4 T-cell count. Dot blot analysis was specifically chosen for HPV DNA screening to detect only relatively substantial HPV DNA infections. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was used for precise DNA typing of dot blot-positive samples. The HPV data were assessed for immune status; a subject with a CD4 T-cell count below 200/microL was considered functionally immunosuppressed. The frequency of dot blot positivity was fivefold higher among immunocompromised (nine of ten) than relatively immunocompetent (four of 22) HIV-infected women. Moreover, four immunosuppressed women, compared with no immunocompetent subjects, had evidence of HPV DNA without signs of HPV-associated lesions by cytology or histology (ie, latent HPV infection). Furthermore, four of nine of the immunocompromised, compared with four of 21 immunocompetent, subjects had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. These frequencies are high compared with those reported in the general population. Finally, HPV 18 was detected in five of the ten women with CD4 T-cell counts below 200/microL and in only one of the 22 with CD4 T-cell counts above that level. These results suggest that the normal immune system suppresses latent and clinical HPV cervical infections and that the efficiency of suppression may be HPV type-specific. Furthermore, impaired immune status, as reflected by CD4 T-cell count, is an important factor increasing the severity of HPV-induced cervical infections in this population."
5149,0.001,1.0000,"Serum samples with indeterminate Western blot (WB) tests from 61 individuals whose sera were positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were studied in order to characterize their putative reactions with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proteins and to resolve the HIV infection status of these individuals. The reaction observed by WB could not be confirmed either by radioimmunoprecipitation assay and subsequent electrophoresis (RIPA) or by use of LiaTek (Organon Teknika, Turnbout, The Netherlands) in 28% of the samples. Of the 86 samples that were indeterminate by WB, 66 reacted with p24 by WB; this reaction was confirmed by RIPA in only 21 (32%) and by LiaTek in 49 (74%) of the 66 samples. On the other hand, none of the indeterminate samples that reacted with HIV envelope proteins by WB did so by LiaTek, while 50% precipitated at least some of these proteins in the RIPA. The sensitivities of the three methods for detecting the antibody reaction with the different HIV proteins, which were studied with serial dilutions of positive serum samples, were similar. Thus, a lower sensitivity of RIPA or LiaTek does not seem to be the cause for the lack of reaction of the WB-indeterminate samples by these two methods. Sequential samples from individuals whose serum samples reacted by the three methods gave reproducible results, but all showed low antibody titers. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from three of the four individuals with sequential samples that reacted with HIV env proteins by WB and RIPA were negative for HIV provirus DNA after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction."

Liver disease has become an important cause of mortality and morbidity in the HIV-infected population. With the improvement of socioeconomic conditions and availability of healthcare in Asian countries in recent years, the epidemiology of sexually transmitted viral hepatitis among HIV-positive men who have sex with men has also evolved.

1679,0.001,1.0000,"The epidemic of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) poses a major ethical question: How can we control the epidemic and the harm that it causes without unjustly discriminating against particular social groups and without unnecessarily infringing on the freedom of individuals? This question pertains to three spheres of public policy in the United States: public health, the delivery of health care, and research. In the public health sphere, vigorous educational efforts will be required, as will modified approaches to intravenous drug use, prostitution, and homosexual and bisexual sexual activity. Carefully targeted, voluntary testing and screening programs should be coupled with counseling and with guarantees of confidentiality and nondiscrimination where these are appropriate. Both health care workers and the health care system have a moral obligation to provide care to people with HIV infection, but heroic self-sacrifice should not be required provided that infection control precautions are observed. Patients with neurological involvement and terminally ill patients will benefit from statutes allowing recognition of advance directives about preferred modes of care or nontreatment. There is a moral imperative to perform intensive research directed toward the understanding, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection and AIDS.

Primary HIV-1 infection was confirmed in each subject by seroconversion and virus isolation. The acute phase of the illness resolved a median of 4 days (range, 3-14 days) from commencement of zidovudine. Six subjects reported symptoms that may have been side-effects of zidovudine, the most common being nausea in four subjects and headache in two. Treatment was discontinued in one subject who had persistent headache and nausea. Haemoglobin, haematocrit and erythrocyte counts decreased and mean corpuscular volume increased significantly during the treatment. None of the subjects developed anaemia and none required dose modification or blood transfusion as a result of haematological side-effects. There were no significant differences in the granulocyte count or the lymphocyte count during any week of treatment when compared with baseline levels. There were no significant differences in T-cell subset numbers of the subjects during treatment compared with a group of historical controls. HIV-1 was isolated from several subjects during and after termination of zidovudine treatment. The results of this investigation indicate that zidovudine is a safe drug to administer to people with primary HIV-1 infection. There was no clear evidence, however, of any clinical benefit in terms of resolution of the acute illness and no indication that the treatment would prevent development of persistent infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Italian and Japanese studies have reported a 40% prevalence rate, but the data were not confirmed by English and Canadian studies. We evaluated the prevalence of HCV infection in 109 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and compared it with a control group composed of 67 patients with Hodgkin's disease and 31 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The prevalence of HCV infection was also determined in blood donors. HCV infection was detected using second and third generation anti-HCV ELISA. Positive results were additionally confirmed using Inno-LIA AbIII and/or RNA-HCV by PCR. Immunohistochemical stains were used to determine B or T cell lineage when the morphological analysis was not sufficient for lymphoma classification. HCV infection was detected in 9% of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, in 2% of patients in the control group (p=0.036), and in 1.2% of blood donors. There was no difference in the prevalence of HCV infection between patients with B or T cell lymphomas. Blood transfusions or previous surgeries, both risk factors for HCV infection, were detected in 90% of the patients with a positive anti-HCV test, in average 17 and 36 years before the diagnosis of lymphoma, respectively. Seventy percent of the patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and a positive anti-HCV test presented evidence of chronic liver disease when the lymphoma was diagnosed.

In most UK centres for the treatment of HIV infection, clinicians have limited experience in caring for Black African patients, and there is a dearth of information about the recognition and management of mental health problems in this patient group. In this investigation the proportion of Black African individuals looked after in a large centre for the care of HIV infection in London was compared with the proportion of such patients referred for specialist mental health help, the results revealing that Black Africans were almost three times less likely to be referred for specialist mental health care. A case control investigation of those referred to mental health services showed that Black Africans were more likely to be suffering from AIDS at the time of referral, be referred for assessment of possible organic brain disease, and more likely to be found to be suffering from major depression or organic brain disease. Reasons for the lesser likelihood of referral to the mental health service are considered, including the possible failure of staff to recognize psychological morbidity in Black Africans, or reluctance and fear on the part of patients to be referred to services that may be perceived as threatening."

Surface CD4 protein was detected on these cells, and recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) blocked infection, indicating that HIV infection was mediated by the cell surface CD4 protein. In contrast, infection of human primary chondrocyte cells (C23), synovial cells (HSA), and foreskin fibroblasts (F13) was apparently independent of cell CD4-mediated mechanisms. Surface CD4 protein could not be detected on these cells, and sCD4 did not block the infection. F13 cells could be infected only by HIV-2, not by HIV-1, under our experimental conditions. In cells of mesenchymal orgin, viral production could be detected only after cocultivation with the human T-lymphoid H9 cells but not by conventional viral assays, including reverse transcriptase and p24 antigen assays in cell culture supernatant and immunofluorescence of host cells. Our DNA transfection studies indicated that this lack of detectable viral production was not due to the inefficient use of the HIV long terminal repeat or the Tat protein in these cells. These mesenchymal and epithelial cells were susceptible to HIV infection but differed in mechanism of virus entry compared with hematopoietic cells such as T lymphocytes. These observations may provide insights into clinical syndromes such as lung dysfunction in HIV-infected newborns and connective tissue disorders in HIV-infected adults."

3455,0.001,1.0000,"The human chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 have emerged as the predominant cofactors, along with CD4, for cellular entry of HIV-1 in vivo whereas the contribution of other chemokine receptors to HIV disease has not been yet determined. CCR5-specific (R5) viruses predominate during primary HIV-1 infection whereas viruses with specificity for CXCR4 (R5/X4 or X4 viruses) often emerge in late stages of HIV disease. The evolution of X4 viruses is associated with a rapid decline in CD4+ T cells, although a causative relationship between viral tropism and CD4+ T cell depletion has not yet been proven. To rigorously test this relationship, we assessed CD4+ T cell depletion in suspensions of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in explants of human lymphoid tissue on exposure to paired viruses that are genetically identical (isogenic) except for select envelope determinants specifying reciprocal tropism for CXCR4 or CCR5. In both systems, X4 HIV-1 massively depleted CD4+ lymphocytes whereas matched R5 viruses depleted such cells only mildly despite comparable viral replication kinetics. These findings demonstrate that the coreceptor specificities of HIV-1 are a causal factor in CD4+ T cell depletion ex vivo and strongly support the hypothesis that the evolution of viral envelope leading to usage of CXCR4 in vivo accelerates loss of CD4+ T cells, causing immunodeficiency."

Antihepatitis D virus (HDV) in serum was measured by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and also by solid phase capture radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HDV. HDV antigen and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA were also measured. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBs were determined by using a commercially available RIA. Anti-HDV (RIA) was only detected in serum that contained HBsAg. These anti-HDV (RIA) positive samples also tested positive with the commercial anti-HDV electroimmunoassay. In addition, the commercial anti-HDV ELISA detected anti-HDV in some serum samples that were negative for HBsAg; these anti HDV-positive HBsAg-negative samples were frequently lipemic or contained rheumatoid factor. The prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBs did not differ significantly with the stage of HIV disease. HBsAg was detected in 3 of 13 (23%) HIV-negative, 5 of 29 (17%) HIV-positive, and 4 of 18 (22%) patients with AIDS. IgG and IgM anti-HDV (RIA) was positive in 2 of 3 HIV-negative and 4 of 5 HIV-positive pre-AIDS HBsAg-positive subjects. However, none of 4 AIDS patients had anti-HDV.

5938,0.001,1.0000,"In the past two decades, major improvements in blood safety have been achieved, particularly for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). A prospective study was carried out between 1996 and 1999 in Brazil to determine the incidence of post-transfusion infection in surgery patients caused by HCV. One hundred sixty-four patients who received a blood transfusion during cardiac surgery were followed for six months and blood samples collected before and after surgery were assessed to investigate HCV infection. Alanine aminotransferase levels were serially determined, as well as clinical data related to hepatitis. Prior to surgery, HCV infection was detected by anti-HCV ELISA III in 6 patients. Any post-surgical samples which were positive by a third generation ELISA test were confirmed by immunoblot and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as were the pre-transfusion samples to exclude pre-transfusion HCV infection not detected by ELISA screening. Results indicated that one patient who was previously considered negative for HCV antibody in the pre-surgical sample was later found to be positive for HCV by RT-PCR in that sample. Seroconversion for HCV antibody after surgery was observed in two patients, one of them with clinical hepatitis; their genotypes were 1a and 1b. The overall prevalence of HCV infection was 4.26% (7/164) and the incidence rate of HCV infection after surgery was 1.27% (2/157). This study shows a high rate of HCV infection acquired post-transfusion in a cohort of surgery patients in Brazil and suggests that better screening methods such as viral RNA assessment may be effective in lowering this rate."
3793,0.001,1.0000,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are among the major public health challenges in Cameroon. This paper determined the effect of men's sex-related behaviors and HIV knowledge on reported STIs. The data came from the 2012 Cameroon's Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) that were collected from 7191 respondents in 2012. Descriptive and logistic regression methods were used for data analysis. Results showed that majority of the respondents were aware of STIs and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), while 3.96% reported STIs. Also, 49.45% of the men had no wife, while 75.58% and 84.58% noted that condoms and keeping of one partner could be used to prevent HIV transmission, respectively. Wrong impressions that mosquito bites and sharing of food could lead to HIV infection were held by 31.94% and 12.44% of the men, respectively. Among those that reported STIs, 33.33%, 30.18% and 13.33% respectively used condom during sex with most recent partner, second to most recent partner and third to most recent partner, compared to 24.69%, 15.04% and 4.17% among those that did not report STIs. Logistic regression results showed that probability of STI increased significantly (p < 0.05) with condom use with third most recent partners, being married, wrong knowledge that mosquito bites cause HIV and being away for more than one month, while it significantly reduced (p < 0.05) with number of children, knowledge that having one partner prevents STIs. It was concluded that policy initiatives and programmes to enhance right sexual knowledge and behavior among men would go a long way in reducing STI incidence in Cameroon."
2009,0.001,1.0000,"Since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, liver disease has been a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Chronic viral hepatitis accounts for >80% of liver-related mortality. Liver-related morbidity is due to acceleration of hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease, drug-induced hepatotoxicity, and, possibly, direct damage from HIV infection itself. As a consequence of this complex interaction, end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma are frequent complications in patients with HIV infection. Infectious diseases physicians who care for HIV-infected patients with advanced HCV-related liver disease need to know how to assess for advanced fibrosis, to know when to refer a patient for endoscopic screening for varices, and to enroll patients in a screening program for hepatocellular carcinoma."
633,0.001,1.0000,"We report the case of two patients in whom acute hepatitis A was associated with a marked and prolonged increase in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral load. Although in one patient the rise in HIV-1 RNA might also have been related to the interruption of antiretroviral therapy, we also observed a similar pattern in the other patient who had a stable undetectable plasma viraemia prior to acute hepatitis and never received treatment with anti-retrovirals. Our observation supports the hypothesis that immune activation that is induced by acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection may trigger HIV-1 replication. This highlights the importance of maintaining antiretroviral therapy throughout the acute phase of hepatitis A and of preventing HAV infection through active immunization."

Typical AIDS-defining illnesses have been substituted by new comorbid conditions that threaten even those patients who maintain virologic suppression. Proper management of cardiovascular risk, and early diagnosis of AIDS-related and, particularly, non-AIDS-related malignancies (including papilomavirus-related neoplasms) must be introduced into the routine of care. Hot areas of investigation include HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, hepatitis B and C coinfection, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and tuberculosis. Bone and kidney long-term toxicities and lipoatrophy remain as issues of paramount importance. The identification and early treatment of immune reconstitution disease is also of major interest, specially in those patients starting their antiretroviral treatment with severe CD4 cell depletion. The present review focuses on these twelve areas of increasing interest for physicians currently facing successfully treated HIV+ patients."

A 34 year-old man with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Lymphadenopathy was observed at the left pulmonary hilum. IRIS was suspected and thoracoscopic surgery was performed to diagnose the cause of lymphadenopathy. Granulomas were observed histologically, and M. parascrofulaceum was cultured. This organism was susceptible to Clarithromycin, rifampicin and levofloxacin. After the operation and without treatment, recurrence of M. parascrofulaceum infection was not observed.

The objective of this study was to compare the outcome of patients with lymphoma transferred to the ICU according to HIV infection status. The clinical characteristics, reason for ICU admission, and outcome of 48 consecutive critically ill patients with lymphoma admitted to the ICU from January 2000 to March 2010 was retrospectively analyzed, focusing on their HIV serology status. Thirty-six patients were HIV-negative and 12 patients HIV-positive. Burkitt lymphoma was more frequent in HIV-infected patients, whereas diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was more frequent in HIV-negative patients. The main acute life-threatening diseases precipitating ICU transfer were similar in both groups. Severe neutropenia was more frequent in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative patients. With a median follow-up of 53 months after ICU admission, the overall survival probabilities were 15% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3-27%) and 17% (95% CI: 0-38%) for HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients, respectively. The 2-year survival probabilities were 34% (95% CI: 10-58%) and 40% (95% CI: 0-43%) for HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients discharged from the ICU, respectively. In this study, HIV infection did not have a negative impact on the outcome of patients with lymphoma admitted to the ICU."

Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) HIV-1 RNA levels and T-cell subsets were measured. In all, 27 newly diagnosed and 12 chronically HIV-1-infected study subjects are included in the analysis. Week 48 plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were <500 copies/ml in 100% of study subjects, and <50 copies/ml in 80% of chronically infected and 100% of newly infected study subjects. The mean change in CD4 was (+)150 cells/microl (newly infected, p <.001), and (+)155 cells/microl (chronically infected, p <.001). At Week 48, evidence of cellular activation persisted in both cohorts. A twice-daily regimen of amprenavir, abacavir, and ZDV/3TC affords potent viral suppression and significant increases in total CD4(+) cells in HIV-1--infected study subjects. Patient intolerance may limit the efficacy of this combination."
8493,0.001,1.0000,"In an exploratory study of virologic and immunomodulatory effects of corticosteroid therapy for wasting syndrome, four HIV-infected adults with recent unexplained weight loss were given tapering doses of prednisone over a 2-month period. Serum neopterin and TNF receptor II levels decreased from baseline after 7 days. An antiretroviral effect was observed initially, peaking on days 14-21 (mean change in HIV-1 branched chain DNA assay on day 21 of -0.52 log10; mean change, from baseline to nadir for each individual, of -0.63 log10); subsequent bDNA levels returned toward baseline as prednisone was tapered. No patient lost weight and there was a mean weight gain of 3.5 kg. Anecdotal reports of corticosteroid benefits in the wasting syndrome may result in part from decreased T cell activation leading to decreased HIV replication, an effect that may be self-limited or that may occur only at higher prednisone doses. Studies involving more targeted immunomodulatory agents for wasting syndrome are warranted."
6460,0.001,1.0000,"Sequential use of antiretroviral therapy with protease inhibitors (PI) is frequently prescribed owing to failure or intolerance of the first selected agent. Controversial data exist about the virological and immunological outcome of patients in whom a change to a second PI regimen is needed. A prospective study of 113 HIV-positive patients (male, 84%; mean age 36 years; previous AIDS-defining event, 35%; previous antiretroviral therapy with nucleoside analogues, 94%) who started a saquinavir-containing regimen between March 1996 and March 1997 and had to change to indinavir (n = 79) owing to intolerance, failure or medical criteria was performed. At the time of the switch, median CD4 cell count was 221 cells/mm3 and the HIV RNA level was 3.98 log10 copies/ml. The rate of viral suppression (HIV RNA levels below 200 copies/ml) was 40% at 3 months and 28% at month 6 after indinavir was instituted. In a logistic regression analysis, only the baseline viral load [relative risk (RR), 2.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.31-6.05; P = 0.007] was statistically associated with the lack of viral suppression on indinavir. Although there are not sufficient data about the best therapeutic option if a change in PI-containing regimens therapy is considered, this study supports the recommendation of an early change of the PI-containing regimens, before the HIV-1 viral load reaches high levels."
295,0.001,1.0000,"The emergence of resistance to lamivudine has been one of the major stumbling blocks to successful treatment and control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. The major mechanism of resistance has been attributed to the alteration in the YMDD motif of the HBV polymerase due to an amino acid change of rtM204 to V/I and an accompanying rtL180M conversion. A novel mutation pattern in a patient having clinical breakthrough under lamivudine therapy was discovered. The mutant had a rtL180C/M204I genotype and was detected after 2 years of therapy with lamivudine. To characterize this novel variant, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a vector construct containing the HBV genome. Transient transfection studies in human hepatoma cells with HBV carrying the new mutant demonstrated that the rtL180C/M204I mutant was resistant to lamivudine up to 10 microM. The resistance profile was comparable to that of the previously reported rtL180 M/M204I-containing virus. These observations were further confirmed by generation of stable cultures transfected with the mutant virus."
6049,0.001,1.0000,"A longitudinal study of 44 haemophilic children, all in a treatment programme with factor concentrates, was undertaken to evaluate the occurrence, characteristics, and evolution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Twenty four children (55%) (group I) showed signs of HBV infection, while 20 (45%) (group II) did not. Age at onset of treatment, number of infusions, and total amount of concentrate received did not show significant differences between the two groups. In group I only four children (16%) had symptomatic acute hepatitis. Chronic liver disease was present in nine patients (38% of infected children). The early age of infection would seem to be an important factor for predicting chronic evolution. Evidence of delta infection in three children with severe liver disease seemed to confirm the high pathogenicity of this agent. Because of the risks associated with chronic HBV infection a careful follow up of patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen is mandatory."
995,0.001,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 fusion inhibitor T-20 (Enfuvirtide, Fuzeon) has recently been introduced into clinical practice. T-20 in combination with HAART efficiently inhibits HIV-1 replication, however T-20 resistance has been reported and the number of confirmed resistant-associated mutations is growing. In this study we aimed to analyze HIV-1 gp41 transmembrane protein (TM) variability and primary resistance to T-20 in plasma viruses from 10 HIV-1 subtype B infected homosexuals. Nine out of ten were documented seroconverters. Nine individuals (including one long time infected therapy naïve individual) were part of four linked virus infection chains. We also examined TM polymorphism in two AIDS patients under HAART and T-20 therapy. Obtained TM amplicons were examined for minor variants by clonal analysis.Sequences polymorphism of the N-terminal regions of the fusion domain (FD) and the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain were demonstrated in examined seroconverters. Analysis of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain revealed T-20 resistance in cloned sequences from 3/10 individuals. In two individuals these mutations were present as minor viral quasispecies. Transmission of the resistant virus to the sexual partner was traced in virus infection chain.Baseline TM amplicons (population sequence) and clones from two patients under HAART did not contain T-20 resistance associated mutations. After onset of T-20 therapy only resistant viruses were identified in plasma from the patients. As shown by clonal analysis of plasma from one patient, treatment interruption results in viruses reverting to a T-20-sensitive genotype."
646,0.001,1.0000,"During the past two decades, great strides have been made in the design of peptidomimetic drugs for the treatment of viral infections, despite the stigma of poor drug-like properties, low oral absorption, and high clearance associated with such compounds. This Account summarizes the progress made toward overcoming such liabilities and highlights the drug discovery efforts that have focused specifically on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors. The arsenal against the incurable disease AIDS, which is caused by HIV infection, includes peptidomimetic compounds that target the virally encoded aspartic protease enzyme. This enzyme is essential to the production of mature HIV particles and plays a key role in maintaining infectivity. However, because of the rapid genomic evolution of viruses, an inevitable consequence in the treatment of all viral infections is the emergence of resistance to the drugs. Therefore, the incomplete suppression of HIV in treatment-experienced AIDS patients will continue to drive the search for more effective therapeutic agents that exhibit efficacy against the mutants raised by the earlier generation of protease inhibitors. Currently, a number of substrate-based peptidomimetic agents that target the virally encoded HCV NS3/4A protease are in clinical development. Mechanistically, these inhibitors can be generally divided into activated carbonyls that are transition-state mimics or compounds that tap into the feedback mode of enzyme-product inhibition. In the HCV field, there is justified optimism that a number of these compounds will soon reach commercialization as therapeutic agents for the treatment of HCV infections. Structural research has guided the successful design of both HIV and HCV protease inhibitors. X-ray crystallography, NMR, and computational studies have provided valuable insight in to the free-state preorganization of peptidomimetic ligands and their enzyme-bound conformation. Researchers have designed a variety of novel bioisosteric replacements of amino acids and short peptides that contain all of the required pharmacophore moieties and play a key role in inducing conformational changes to the overall molecule. The knowledge gained from these studies will undoubtedly guide the future design of therapeutic agents and further contribute to the success of this field."
8183,0.001,1.0000,"Despite extensive epidemiological evidence suggesting that Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) has an infectious origin, a specific viral association with KS had not been documented until recently, when two novel DNA fragments were identified in KS lesional tissue from a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). These fragments belong to a previously unidentified human herpesvirus, called KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), or human herpesvirus 8. Although this virus is generally absent from normal control tissues, inflammatory conditions, and a variety of tumors, it is present in most AIDS- as well as non-AIDS-related KS lesions, suggesting that it is not simply an opportunistic infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Furthermore, this virus is consistently present in a specific type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, frequently although not exclusively occurring in patients with AIDS (namely, the primary effusion lymphomas, previously called body cavity-based lymphomas). KSHV is also present in a significant proportion of cases of AIDS- and non-AIDS-related multicentric Castleman's disease. Sequence analysis has led to the identification of genes in the KSHV genome that may have important pathobiological functions, and experimental approaches have been developed to isolate, grow and transmit KSHV in vitro. An understanding of KSHV is important for evaluating its role in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphomas, and multicentric Castleman's disease, and to help develop better methods for the prevention and treatment of these diseases."
5833,0.001,1.0000,"A growing number of reports indicates that certain groups of individuals who almost certainly have been exposed to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), yet continue to exhibit no signs or symptoms of infection, often have subtle evidence of specific immunity. We studied such a high-risk (HR) cohort of persistently seronegative individuals with histories of long-term sexual exposure to an HIV-infected partner to look for evidence of both humoral and cellular immunity that might have been induced by exposure to the virus. Twenty-three heterosexual and four homosexual monogamous couples with discordant HIV status were included in the study. Twelve of the HR partners were studied for in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by HIV envelope-derived peptides. All 12 responded overwhelmingly to a peptide containing the fifth conserved region of gp120. By generating and cloning T cell lines specific for this peptide, we concluded that in these individuals the T cell response to the envelope is mainly focused on the carboxy-terminus region of gp120 and is characterized by an oligoclonal expansion of CD4+ T cells expressing the same TCR Eighteen HR partners and 37 HIV-1 seropositive subjects were tested for the presence of anti-CD4 antibodies (anti-CD4 Abs) using a recombinant CD4-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-CD4 Abs were detected in eight of the HR partners (six confirmed by Western blot) and in nine of the HIV-1 seropositive subjects (eight confirmed by Western blot). Results from binding competition assays with a panel of monoclonal anti-CD4 Abs suggested that the anti-CD4 Abs detected in the HR partners are directed toward epitopes that are induced by gp120 binding. Twenty-seven of the HR partners were tested for the presence of antibodies that cross-react with HLA class I and gp120 (anti-HLA Abs). Anti-HLA Abs were detected in 16 of the HR partner sera and in 4/94 sera from a control population of normal healthy blood donors. Taken together, the results suggest that in some individuals with a history of long-term exposure to HIV, specific immunity may develop in the absence of overt infection. The common trigger for these responses is gp120."
6494,0.001,1.0000,"We have established a line of malignantly transformed human B cells by infecting purified primary B lymphocytes with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This line, termed B-HIV1, may serve as a model system for a subset of AIDS-related B-cell lymphomas in which the transformed phenotype may be initiated and/or maintained through an HIV-1 gene product. The B-HIV1 line contains both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HIV-1 genomes. In addition, the c-myc gene is expressed at levels 10 to 20 times those in normal B cells. Similarly, EBV sequences, including those for the latent membrane protein (LMP), are expressed at greatly enhanced levels relative to expression in normal, EBV-immortalized B cells. The upregulation of c-myc and of EBV gene expression can both be produced by infection of susceptible B cells (not already harboring HIV) with exogenous HIV-1. The B-HIV1 line exhibits properties of malignantly transformed cells, in that it grows logarithmically in 1% serum, clones in soft agar, and produces invasive, malignant B-cell lymphomas in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. We have shown that HIV-1 has the ability to infect primary human B cells and to activate expression of EBV and c-myc. HIV activation of EBV has been documented previously in certain cell lines, here we note that such activation can occur in primary B cells and, under certain conditions, can result in outgrowth of immortalized cell lines. This phenomenon may contribute to the clinical manifestation of lymphadenopathy early after infection with HIV. In addition, we have demonstrated that HIV infection of primary B cells in vitro can result in appearance of a fully malignant phenotype. This phenotype is likely to be due, at least in part, to the activation of c-myc by HIV. Preliminary experiments indicate that Tat, the gene product of the transactivator of viral gene transcription tat, can upregulate c-myc transcription after addition to the culture media of certain B-cell lines. This raises the possibility that Tat can bind to target sequences in cellular RNA and enhance transcription as it does for HIV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
9411,0.001,1.0000,"We previously reported finding the RNA of a type K human endogenous retrovirus, HERV-K (HML-2), at high titers in the plasma of HIV-1-infected and cancer patients (R. Contreras-Galindo et al., J. Virol. 82:9329-9236, 2008.). The extent to which the HERV-K (HML-2) proviruses become activated and the nature of their activated viral RNAs remain important questions. Therefore, we amplified and sequenced the full-length RNA of the env gene of the type 1 and 2 HERV-K (HML-2) viruses collected from the plasma of seven HIV-1-infected patients over a period of 1 to 3 years and from five breast cancer patients in order to reconstruct the genetic evolution of these viruses. HERV-K (HML-2) RNA was found in plasma fractions of HIV-1 patients at a density of ∼1.16 g/ml that contained both immature and correctly processed HERV-K (HML-2) proteins and virus-like particles that were recognized by anti-HERV-K (HML-2) antibodies. RNA sequences from novel HERV-K (HML-2) proviruses were discovered, including K111, which is specifically active during HIV-1 infection. Viral RNA arose from complete proviruses and proviruses devoid of a 5' long terminal repeat, suggesting that the expression of HERV-K (HML-2) RNA in these patients may involve sense and antisense transcription. In HIV-1-infected individuals, the HERV-K (HML-2) viral RNA showed evidence of frequent recombination, accumulation of synonymous rather than nonsynonymous mutations, and conserved N-glycosylation sites, suggesting that some of the HERV-K (HML-2) viral RNAs have undergone reverse transcription and are under purifying selection. In contrast, HERV-K (HML-2) RNA sequences found in the blood of breast cancer patients showed no evidence of recombination and exhibited only sporadic viral mutations. This study suggests that HERV-K (HML-2) is active in HIV-1-infected patients, and the resulting RNA message reveals previously undiscovered HERV-K (HML-2) genomic sequences."
572,0.001,1.0000,"Virus variants escaping from host immunity may be implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In this cross-sectional study, the association was evaluated of the frequency of amino acid variation within the immunogenic epitopes of surface gene with different disease stages of chronic HBV infection. The surface gene of HBV encompassing the a determinant (amino acids 124-148) and the putative HLA class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope (amino acids 28- 51) were amplified and directly sequenced in 33 asymptomatic carriers (Group I), 31 patients with chronic hepatitis (Group II), 22 with cirrhosis (Group III), and 36 with hepatocellular carcinoma (Group IV). The amino acid sequences were compared subsequently with the consensus sequences of HBV serotype adw or adr. The frequency of amino acid variation per site per sequence (FEQ) was analyzed by generalized estimating equation with Poisson model after stratification by clinical and virological features. The FEQ was 1.21% overall, and was highest in Group IV patients and in patients above 50 years of age. In contrast, nine Group IV patients aged below 50 years who were infected with serotype adw had an inversely higher FEQ than those above 50; the age effect among hepatocellular carcinoma patients was significantly different from that among non-cancerous patients (P = 0.04). Variation of amino acid clustered within a determinant and CTL epitope for serotype adw but was distributed at random for serotype adr. Mutation hotspots differed between serotypes adw and adr. The FEQ of HBV surface protein is correlated positively with advancing age and severity of liver disease, and certain variants may contribute to the persistence of HBV infection."
4432,0.001,1.0000,"Infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype C is associated with a prolonged viremic phase, delayed hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion, and an increased incidence of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma compared with genotype B infection. Genotype C is also associated with the more frequent emergence of core promoter mutations, which increase genome replication and are independently associated with poor clinical outcomes. We amplified full-length HBV genomes from serum samples from Chinese and U. S. patients with chronic HBV infection and transfected circularized genome pools or dimeric constructs of individual clones into Huh7 cells. The two genotypes could be differentiated by Western blot analysis due to the reactivities of M and L proteins toward a monoclonal pre-S2 antibody and slightly different S-protein mobilities. Great variability in replication capacity was observed for both genotypes. The A1762T/G1764A core promoter mutations were prevalent in genotype C isolates and correlated with increased replication capacity, while the A1752G/T mutation frequently found in genotype B isolates correlated with a low replication capacity. Importantly, most genotype C isolates with wild-type core promoter sequence replicated less efficiently than the corresponding genotype B isolates due to less efficient transcription of the 3.5-kb RNA. However, genotype C isolates often displayed more efficient virion secretion. We propose that the low intracellular levels of viral DNA and core protein of wild-type genotype C delay immune clearance and trigger the subsequent emergence of A1762T/G1764A core promoter mutations to upregulate replication; efficient virion secretion compensates for the low replication capacity to ensure the establishment of persistent infection by genotype C."
3250,0.001,1.0000,"The transmission of infectious diseases, mainly hepatitis B, non-A non-B and HIV infection, was the major complication of replacement therapy in hemophiliacs before the introduction of virus inactivated concentrates. The clinical relevance of transfusion associated infections in 43 hemophiliacs treated with different coagulation preparations during an observation period from 1978 to 1986, is discussed. Up to 1981, 38 hemophiliacs have shown hepatitis B seroconversion; 20 of them had a permanent increase in ALT levels. Only two among the five seronegative hemophiliacs showed an immune response to vaccination against hepatitis B. During the observation period 13 hemophiliacs contracted clinical non-A non-B hepatitis. Ten hemophiliacs have been HIV infected. Both hepatitis B and HIV infection occurred more frequently in hemophiliacs treated with foreign concentrates. One patient died of liver cirrhosis, another of AIDS. Since 1986. Swiss hemophiliacs have only been treated with virus inactivated concentrates: therefore no further HIV infections or hepatitis have been observed. Different methods of virus inactivation and factor VIIC purification are discussed. Since factor VIII yield is very low in the ultrapure and virusfree concentrates, a worldwide shortage of factor VIII concentrates is going on. It remains to be expected whether the availability of recombinant factor VIIIC will resolve these problems in the near future."
9509,0.001,1.0000,"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a potent trans-activator of transcription from the viral LTR promoter. Previous mutagenesis studies have identified domains within Tat responsible for binding to its TAR RNA target and for transcriptional activation. The minimal Tat activation domain is composed of the N-terminal 48 residues, and mutational analyses identified a cluster of critical cysteines. The importance of four highly conserved aromatic amino acids within the activation domain has not been thoroughly investigated. We have systematically substituted these aromatic residues (Y26, F32, F38, Y47) of the HIV-1 LAI Tat protein with other aromatic residues (conservative mutation) or alanine (nonconservative mutation). The activity of the mutant Tat constructs was measured in different cell lines by transfection with a LTR-CAT reporter plasmid. The range of transcriptional activities measured for this set of Tat mutants allowed careful assessment of the level of Tat activity required for optimal viral replication. To test this, the mutant Tat genes were introduced into the pLAI infectious molecular clone and tested for their effect on virus replication in a T-cell line. We found that a twofold reduction in Tat activity already affects viral replication, and no virus replication was measured for Tat mutants with less than 15% activity. This strict correlation between Tat activity and viral replication demonstrates the importance of the Tat function to viral fitness. Interestingly, a less pronounced replication defect was observed in primary cell types. This finding may correlate with the frequent detection of proviruses with Tat-inactivating mutations in clinical samples."
357,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of the study was to select, from a panel of candidate European human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) clade B primary virus isolates, one isolate based on replication properties in chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Secondly, to evaluate the in vivo kinetics of primary infection of the selected isolate at two different doses in two mature, outbred chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Four different low passage, human PBMC-cultured 'primary' HIV-1 isolates with European clade B consensus sequence were compared for their ability to replicate in vitro in chimpanzee versus human PBMC. The isolate which yielded the highest titre and most vigorous cytopathic effect in chimpanzee PBMC was evaluated for coreceptor usage and chosen for evaluation in vivo. Only the HIV-1Han2 isolate replicated in chimpanzee PBMC in vitro at detectable levels. This isolate was demonstrated to utilize CCR4, CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors and could be inhibited by beta-chemokines. Infection of chimpanzees was demonstrated by viral RNA and DNA PCR analysis, both in plasma as well as in PBMC and lymph node cells as early as 3 weeks after inoculation. Antibodies developed within 6 weeks and continued to increase to a maximum titre of approximately 12800, thereafter remaining in this range over the follow-up period of 2 years. Compared to cell line-adapted HIV-1 isolates there were slight but no dramatic differences in the kinetics of infection of chimpanzees with this particular primary isolate."
5996,0.001,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific Vpu is an 81-amino-acid amphipathic integral membrane protein with at least two different biological functions: (i) enhancement of virus particle release from the plasma membrane of HIV-1-infected cells and (ii) degradation of the virus receptor CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We have previously found that Vpu is phosphorylated in infected cells at two seryl residues in positions 52 and 56 by the ubiquitous casein kinase 2. To study the role of Vpu phosphorylation on its biological activity, a mutant of the vpu gene lacking both phosphoacceptor sites was introduced into the infectious molecular clone of HIV-1, pNL4-3, as well as subgenomic Vpu expression vectors. This mutation did not affect the expression level or the stability of Vpu but had a significant effect on its biological activity in infected T cells as well as transfected HeLa cells. Despite the presence of comparable amounts of wild-type and nonphosphorylated Vpu, decay of CD4 was observed only in the presence of phosphorylated wild-type Vpu. Nonphosphorylated Vpu was unable to induce degradation of CD4 even if the proteins were artificially retained in the ER. In contrast, Vpu-mediated enhancement of virus secretion was only partially dependent on Vpu phosphorylation. Enhancement of particle release by wild-type Vpu was efficiently blocked when Vpu was artificially retained in the ER, suggesting that the two biological functions of Vpu are independent, occur at different sites within a cell, and exhibit different sensitivity to phosphorylation."
6110,0.001,1.0000,"We evaluated the association between two antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence measurements--the medication possession ratio (MPR) and patient self-report--and detectable HIV viremia in the setting of rapid service scale-up in Lusaka, Zambia. Drug adherence and outcomes were assessed in a subset of patients suspected of treatment failure based on discordant clinical and immunologic responses to ART. A total of 913 patients were included in this analysis, with a median time of 744 days (Q1, Q3: 511, 919 days) from ART initiation to viral load (VL) measurement. On aggregate over the period of follow-up, 531 (58%) had optimal adherence (MPR > or =95%), 306 (34%) had suboptimal adherence (MPR 80-94%), and 76 (8%) had poor adherence (MPR <80%). Of the 913 patients, 238 (26%) had VL > or =400 copies/ml when tested. When compared to individuals with optimal adherence, there was increasing risk for virologic failure in those with suboptimal adherence [adjusted relative risk (ARR): 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, 1.6] and those with poor adherence (ARR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.4) based on MPR. During the antiretroviral treatment course, 676 patients (74%) reported no missed doses. The proportion of patients with virologic failure did not differ significantly among those reporting any missed dose from those reporting perfect adherence (26% vs. 26%, p = 0.97). Among patients with suspected treatment failure, a lower MPR was associated with higher rates of detectable viremia. However, the suboptimal sensitivity and specificity of MPR limit its utility as a sole predictor of virologic failure."
580,0.001,1.0000,"Groups of rhesus monkeys were inoculated with: 1) simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)B670 alone; 2) Mycobacterium leprae alone; 3) SIV plus M. leprae on the same day; and 4) M. leprae 2 weeks after SIV. Animals were monitored at intervals for virus loads, antibody responses to M. leprae glycolipid antigens and to SIV Gp120, T-cell CD4+ and CD4+ CD29+ subset percentages, leprosy and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinical symptoms. Five out of six animals developed leprosy in each co-inoculated group, compared to one out of six in the M. leprae-only-inoculated group, indicating that M. leprae/SIV co-infection increases the susceptibility to leprosy, regardless of the timing of the two infections. Animals in the co-infected group that received M. leprae 2 weeks after SIV had a significantly slower rate of AIDS progression and long-term survival was significantly greater (three out of six) compared to the group inoculated with SIV alone (zero out of seven). All M. leprae-only-inoculated animals (six out of six) survived. Post-SIV-inoculation, a rapid decrease in the percentages of CD4 + and CD4 + CD29 + T-cells was observed in the SIV-only-inoculated group that was significantly blocked by co-inoculation with M. leprae 2 weeks after SIV, but not by SIV on the same day. The virus load set point was increased by approximately two logs in the group inoculated with M. leprae and SIV on the same day compared to SIV 2 weeks prior to M. leprae or the SIV-only-inoculated group. The results indicate that M. leprae, inoculated 2 weeks after SIV, decreased the pathogenicity of SIV compared to inoculation of M. leprae and SIV on the same day or SIV alone. The decreased pathogenicity correlated with a diminished loss of CD4 + and CD4 + CD29 + T-cell subsets in the group inoculated with M. leprae 2 weeks after SIV compared to the group inoculated with SIV alone. IgG antibody responses to M. leprae-specific cell wall phenolic glycolipid-I antigen were inhibited by 2-week-prior or same-day SIV co-inoculation compared to M. leprae-only inoculated animals. The IgG anti-lipoarabinomannan antibody response was enhanced in the group inoculated with M. leprae and SIV on the same day compared to the groups inoculated with M. leprae alone or SIV 2 weeks prior to M. leprae. Antibody responses to SIV Gp120 antigen were unimpaired in both co-inoculated groups compared to SIV-only-inoculated groups. The antibody results show that the immune responses to SIV and M. leprae are interrelated in SIV/M. leprae co-infected animals."
4915,0.001,1.0000,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial agent used to treat patients with autoimmune diseases, has been shown to suppress human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in vitro in T cells and monocytes by inhibiting posttranscriptional modification of the virus. These in vitro observations have been expanded into an in vivo study of HCQ as a potential anti-HIV-1 agent in HIV-1-infected patients. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 40 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients who had CD4+ counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either HCQ 800 mg/d or placebo for 8 weeks. Virologic and immunologic parameters, including HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) via use of polymerase chain reaction, viral culture, antigen and mitogen responses, and proinflammatory cytokine levels were measured at the beginning and end of the study. The amount of recoverable HIV-1 RNA in plasma declined significantly in the HCQ group over the 8-week period (P = 0.022), while it increased in the placebo group. The percentage of CD4+ T cells remained stable in the HCQ-treated group (18.1 +/- 9.2% before treatment vs 18.6 +/- 10.5% after treatment) and fell significantly in the placebo group (21 +/- 7% before treatment vs 19.3 +/- 6.3% after treatment; P = 0.032). However, this was not reflected as a change in absolute CD4+ counts for either group (HCQ, 262.8 +/- 166 cells/mm3 vs 251 +/- 163 cells/mm3; placebo, 312 +/- 121 cells/mm3 vs 321 +/- 124 cells/mm3). Mitogen- and antigen-specific responses remained constant in the HCQ group while T cell proliferative responses to Candida decreased in the placebo group (4.8 +/- 3.6 x 10(3) SI [stimulation index] vs 3.0 +/- 3.0 x 10(3) SI; P = 0.032). Lastly, serum interleukin 6 levels declined in the HCQ group (14.3 +/- 13.5 U/mL vs 12.0 +/- 16.7 U/mL; P = 0.023) but not in the placebo group (11.3 +/- 8.8 U/mL vs 7.0 +/- 11.7 U/mL); this was coincident with a decrease in serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G (2563 +/- 1352 mg/mL vs 2307 +/- 1372 mg/dL; P = 0.032), compared with the placebo group (2733 +/- 1473 mg/dL vs 2709 +/- 1501 mg/dL). No other parameters, including serum p24 and beta-2 microglobulin levels, were altered by HCQ therapy. HCQ thus may be useful in the treatment of patients with HIV-1 infection."
6552,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1-infected patients are surviving longer and by 2015 half will be older than 50 years of age. Frailty is a syndrome associated with advanced age but occurs in HIV-1-infected patients at younger ages. One hundred outpatient HIV-1-infected persons were prospectively tested for clinical markers of frailty: shrinking weight, slowness in walking, decrease in grip strength, low activity, and exhaustion. Age, length of infection with HIV, CD4 count, HIV-1 RNA, and comorbidities were compared. CD4 counts <200 cells/mm(3) were associated with 9-fold increased odds of frailty relative to patients with a CD4 count >350 cells/mm(3) (odds ratio [OR] 9.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-44). Seven frail patients were measured 6 months later: 2 died refusing therapy, 4 were no longer frail, and 1 patient remained frail. We conclude that frailty is common in HIV outpatients and is associated with low CD4 counts. However, our data suggest that frailty is transient, especially in younger patients who may revert to their prefrail state unlike uninfected elderly individuals in whom a stepwise decline in function occurs."
5484,0.001,1.0000,"Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a known complication during and after anti-cancer therapy. This condition can affect two patient populations: it is most commonly seen in patients who are seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but it is also being increasingly reported among patients who are HBsAg-negative but who have prior infection, as evident by seropositive status for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), irrespective of their anti-HBs (antibody to HBsAg) status. The clinical course can vary from asymptomatic hepatitis to fulminant hepatic failure that can be potentially fatal. With the increasing use of biological agents in addition to potent cytotoxic chemotherapy in the armamentarium of anti-cancer treatments, reactivation of hepatitis B has become a common clinical situation that is faced by both oncologists and hepatologists especially in HBV endemic areas. In this review, we discuss the clinical course of reactivation in the two HBV-infected sub-populations, and the role of anti-virals in the prevention and management of HBV reactivation in association with cytotoxic chemotherapy and biological therapies."
408,0.001,1.0000,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a slow, progressive, degenerative disease of the human immune system, ultimately leading to premature death of the patient. This disease is primarily caused by human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). The major targets of HIV infection are blood cells, namely lymphocytes and macrophages. While the immune response fails to eliminate the infected cells, the virus continues to spread. The purpose of HIV gene therapy is to provide ""anti-HIV"" genes to cells that are susceptible to HIV infection. Anti-HIV genes may be designed to express RNAs or proteins that interfere with the function of viral or cellular RNA(s)/protein(s), thereby inhibiting virus replication. Whereas interfering proteins may be cytotoxic and/or immunogenic, interfering RNAs are not. Interfering protein-based strategies requiring inducible gene expression (under the control of HIV regulatory proteins) can only be designed to block steps subsequent to the viral regulatory protein production. In contrast, interfering RNAs can be produced in a constitutive manner, which further enhances their antiviral activity and allows one to design strategies to inhibit virus replication before viral regulatory protein production occurs. Thus, interfering RNAs are of particular interest and are the focus of this review. Genes expressing interfering RNAs were designed to inhibit syncytium formation to prevent the death of the gene-modified cells. Strategies may also be developed to prevent gene-modified cells from becoming infected by HIV or from supporting HIV replication. Genes expressing interfering RNAs have been designed to inhibit HIV-1 entry and to cleave the incoming virion RNA, thus blocking virus replication before provirus DNA synthesis can be completed. A number of genes were also designed to express interfering RNAs that inhibit HIV replication at a post-integration step, by inhibiting the function of HIV RNAs or proteins produced in the infected cell. Also in development are anti-HIV genes that produce RNAs that would not only inhibit HIV replication in the gene-modified cell, but also prevent HIV RNA packaging and/or reverse transcription such that the progeny virus produced would be non-infectious. Further refinements to these strategies may lead to the development of ""self-propagating"" anti-HIV genes. These genes would express interfering RNAs that not only inhibit virus replication in the cell and prevent HIV RNA packaging and/or reverse transcription in the progeny virus, but also make use of the HIV itself to deliver the anti-HIV gene(s) to other cells. Thus, more and more cells susceptible to HIV infection would become resistant. Such ""self-propagation"" of anti-HIV-1 genes would only occur in cells that are susceptible to HIV infection, and would continue to take place for as long as HIV exists in the body."
36,0.001,1.0000,"There is increasing evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection of an immunosuppressed host is associated with the appearance of virus mutants. To characterize the virus circulating in patients in detail, eleven full-length HBV genomes, isolated from the serum of five highly viraemic renal transplant recipients with liver disease, were cloned and sequenced. The genomes contained deletions in the C gene, deletions in the pre-S1/2 region frequently removing the pre-S2 initiation codon, premature termination codons in the pre-S1 or S region, and/or deletions/insertions in the X gene/core promoter. The mutations occurred at different positions and in various combinations; even mutant genomes circulating within a patient differed strikingly. It is concluded that long-term immunosuppression is associated with the occurrence of heterogeneous populations of partially defective HBV characterized by a specific mutation pattern. Efficient intracellular trans-complementation probably enables high virus replication in vivo."
9909,0.001,1.0000,"Currently, it is possible to construct recombinant forms of various viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), that carry foreign genes such as a reporter or marker protein in their genomes. These recombinant viruses usually faithfully mimic the life cycle of the original virus in infected cells and exhibit the same host range dependence. The development of a recombinant virus enables the efficient screening of inhibitors and the identification of specific host factors. However, to date the construction of recombinant hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been difficult because of various experimental limitations. The main limitation is the compact genome size of HBV, and a fairly strict genome size that does not exceed 1.3 genome sizes, that must be packaged into virions. Thus, the size of a foreign gene to be inserted should be smaller than 0.4 kb if no deletion of the genome DNA is to be performed. Therefore, to overcome this size limitation, the deletion of some HBV DNA is required. Here, we report the construction of recombinant HBV encoding a reporter gene to monitor the early stage of the HBV replication cycle by replacing part of the HBV core-coding region with the reporter gene by deleting part of the HBV pol coding region. Detection of recombinant HBV infection, monitored by the reporter activity, was highly sensitive and less expensive than detection using the currently available conventional methods to evaluate HBV infection. This system will be useful for a number of applications including high-throughput screening for the identification of anti-HBV inhibitors, host factors and virus-susceptible cells."
1514,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can evolve by mutations in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) to permit its escape from neutralization by antibodies such as HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs) and from host immune responses. This study investigated the prevalence and pattern of MHR mutations in North China and the clinical correlations of these mutations. The MHRs of 161 HBsAg-positive patients were amplified using nested PCR, and directly sequenced to identify MHR mutations. It was showed that among the 161 patients infected with HBV genotype C in North China, the overall frequency of MHR mutation was 46.6%. Furthermore, MHR mutations were associated with high white blood cell counts (P = 0.025), high bilirubin levels (P = 0.048), and cirrhosis (P = 0.010). The most frequent mutations in patients with both HBsAg-positive and anti-HBs-positive were located in subregion 1 and 3 of MHR, specifically, residue Q101 (29.9%) and I126 (70.6%), which was different from the mutation pattern found in Western Europe and the United States. Taken together, these data indicated important virological and clinical aspects of HBV evolution in terms of the surface gene of genotype C, which might be important for its response to the currently available HBV vaccine."

7821,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence and de novo HBV infection are frequent events in liver transplantation recipients. Treatment with lamivudine is initially efficient in both infections but the incidence of lamivudine-resistant HBV emergence increases over time. Adefovir appears to be promising in post-liver transplantation patients with recurrent HBV infection and lamivudine-resistant HBV. This study analyzed adefovir treatment in 42 post-liver transplantation patients who developed recurrent HBV or de novo HBV infection with lamivudine-resistant HBV (54.8% HCV-coinfected). Patients received 10 mg of oral adefovir once daily for a mean period of time of 21.5 months (range from 12 to 31 months). In 62.9% of patients, ALT levels decreased significantly. Serum HBV-DNA was undetectable in 64% of the cases. Twenty percent of patients lost HBeAg marker and 13.3% of them developed anti-HBe. In 9.5% of recipients, HBsAg became negative. There was no significant change in serum creatinine levels. In only one patient was worsening of the renal function detected, making dose adjustment necessary. No other side effects were reported. Our results confirm the efficacy and safety of adefovir treatment in post-liver transplantation patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV, neither were adefovir-resistant mutations identified in patients after 21 months of therapy, nor were there adverse events, especially renal toxicity."
804,0.001,1.0000,"Reinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) after liver transplantation is nearly universal in patients not receiving immunoprophylaxis. Because reinfection reduces graft and patient survival, treatment of recurrent infection is important. Interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) is an effective therapy for chronic hepatitis B infection in immunocompetent patients, but its efficacy in transplant recipients has not been established. Fourteen liver transplant recipients with recurrent hepatitis B infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] positive in serum; hepatitis on biopsy) were treated with IFN-alpha 2b (Intron A; Schering Inc, Kenilworth, NJ) 3 million units (MU) three times weekly for 23.5 weeks (median, range 4 to 41). The primary endpoint was loss of HBV DNA by the b-DNA assay (a virological response). Before treatment, all patients were HBV DNA positive and 9 were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive. Pretreatment HBV DNA levels were 6,760 MEq/mL (median, range 2.0 to 11,888 MEq/mL). HBV DNA levels decreased significantly with treatment (P = .03). Four patients had a complete and sustained virological response. Virological responses did not consistently correlate with biochemical response because of concomitant hepatitis C. Two patients had a serological response; 1 lost HBeAg, another lost HBeAg and HBsAg. All responders remained HBV DNA negative in follow-up (mean, 32 months; range, 23 to 40), but 1 patient required retransplantation for cirrhosis. Of the nonresponders, 1 patient required retransplantation for chronic rejection, 3 required retransplantation for recurrent hepatitis B, 3 died with recurrent hepatitis B, and 3 are alive and remain HBV DNA positive. IFN-alpha can induce a sustained serological (14%) and virological response (29%) in liver transplant recipients with recurrent HBV infection."
1599,0.001,1.0000,"There are few studies on health-facility based prevalence rates for dual hepatitis B virus-hepatitis C virus (HBV-HCV) infection on a state-wide scale in Nigeria. In this study we determined the state-wide prevalence rate of dual positivity of hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HCV antibody among hospital patients of Ekiti State, Nigeria, and identified associated factors. Consenting apparently-healthy patients visiting health centers in all local government area (LGA) headquarters of Ekiti State were consecutively selected to a total of 2000 individuals. Patient demographic data pertinent to HBV and HCV transmission were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Subsequently, serum samples prepared from the aseptically collected blood was tested for the presence of both HBsAg and anti-HCV antibody using DiaSpot test strips. The results were analyzed using binary logistic regression. Dual positivity of 7.40% was recorded among the study participants, with 9.80% and 12.80%, respectively, testing positive for HBsAg and anti-HCV antibody. The study patients were, however, most likely to be anti-HCV antibody positive. Nine of the 10 factors studied were independently associated with dual positivity. Five of these, in descending order of odds ratio, were: illiteracy (15.76, p=0.001); having ≥4 sexual partners (9.46, p=0.001); age range of 35-44 y (8.46,p=0.001); farming (7.33, p=0.001); and ""not at all"" to use of condoms during sexual intercourse (4.39, p=0.001).

6594,0.001,1.0000,"Current therapy for chronic hepatitis B is suboptimal as a result of limited durable response rates, cumulative viral resistance, and/or poor tolerability. Telbivudine has potent antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vitro and in the woodchuck model and has a promising preclinical safety profile. In this first clinical study of telbivudine, safety, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics were assessed in 43 adults with hepatitis B e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B. This placebo-controlled dose-escalation trial investigated 6 telbivudine daily dosing levels (25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/d); treatment was given for 4 weeks, with 12 weeks' follow-up. Serum HBV DNA levels were monitored via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results indicate that telbivudine was well tolerated at all dosing levels, with no dose-related or treatment-related clinical or laboratory adverse events. telbivudine plasma pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional within the studied dose range. Marked dose-related antiviral activity was evident, with a maximum at telbivudine doses of 400 mg/d or more. In the 800 mg/d cohort, the mean HBV DNA reduction was 3.75 log10 copies/mL at week 4, comprising a 99.98% reduction in serum viral load. Correspondingly, posttreatment return of viral load was slowest in the high-dose groups. Viral dynamic analyses suggested a high degree of efficiency of inhibition of HBV replication by telbivudine and helped refine selection of the optimal dose. In conclusion, these results support expanded clinical studies of this new agent for the treatment of hepatitis B."
5141,0.001,1.0000,"Monitoring hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants periodically during nucleoside analogue treatment is of great clinical significance, particularly in persistently HBV DNA-positive patients. However, few studies have investigated the dynamic changes of HBV YMDD (Tyr-Met-Asp-Asp) and YVDD (Tyr-Val-Asp-Asp) populations in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients whilst undergoing lamivudine (LMV) treatment. In this study, we sought to investigate the dynamic changes of HBV YMDD and YVDD variants by ultrasensitive real-time amplification refractory mutation system quantitative PCR (RT-ARMS-qPCR) and evaluate its significance for changes in the treatment of CHB patients. RT-ARMS-qPCR was established and evaluated with standard recombinant plasmids. Fifteen CHB patients receiving LMV (100 mg daily) were consecutively recruited and followed up for 60 weeks. Serum samples were obtained from each patient at baseline and every 12 weeks. The total HBV DNA, HBV YMDD DNA and YVDD DNA levels were measured using RT-ARMS-qPCR at all given time points after treatment. Routine liver biochemistry parameters, including aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, were also measured every 12 weeks. The linear range of the assay was between 1×10(12) and 1×10(5) copies ml(-1). The low detection limit was 1×10(4) copies ml(-1). After 60 weeks of LMV treatment, nine patients experienced virological breakthrough. The YVDD variant could be detected 12-48 weeks before virological breakthrough. The YVDD variant was detected as the predominant population (range 69.4-100 %) in patients by the time virological breakthrough appeared. We concluded that RT-ARMS-qPCR was sensitive for the detection and quantification of low levels of HBV mutation. Periodic detection of HBV YM(V)DD every 12 weeks during LMV treatment is helpful for therapeutic decision making. "
7968,0.001,1.0000,"We experienced a 24-year-old Japanese man, who was a hepatitis B virus carrier with nephrotic syndrome. Liver biopsy showed that he was suffering from chronic hepatitis (activity 2, fibrosis 2). Renal biopsy revealed membranous nephropathy(MN) with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis(FGS). Immunofluorescentic findings revealed the presence of HBe antigen along the glomerular capillaries as well as HBe antigenemia in circulation. Therefore, we diagnosed this case as HB virus-related membranous nephropathy associated with FGS lesions. He was treated with interferon(IFN) alpha-2b for over a month and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. These therapies reduced urinary protein excretion from 4-6 g/day to 1-2 g/day, in accordance with a decrease in the titer of HBV DNA polymerase. The second renal biopsy revealed that the histological change from MN to membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis Type III after IFN therapy. These results suggest that IFN therapy might be effective for HB virus-related MN associated with FGS."
2132,0.001,1.0000,"Loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered to reflect the resolution of a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Patient characteristics and various seromarkers were evaluated to characterize factors predicting spontaneous HBsAg loss in a cohort of HBeAg-seronegative patients with presumed chronic HBV infection. Relationships between seromarkers and HBsAg loss were assessed annually and after 6 years using binary logistic regression. Among the 634 participants, 117 (18.45%) cleared HBsAg after 6 years, with a 3.08% annual seroclearance rate. Baseline HBsAg levels and platelet (PLT) counts were predictors of HBsAg seroclearance. The HBsAg level predicted HBsAg seroclearance better than the PLT count (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): HBsAg, 0.965 (95%CI, 0.947-0.980) versus PLT count, 0.617 (95%CI, 0.561-0.669); P < 0.001). A cutoff HBsAg level of 10 IU/ml at baseline predicted spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance at 6 years with a diagnostic accuracy of 93.4%, a sensitivity of 87.2%, a specificity of 94.8%, a positive predictive value of 79.1%, and a negative predictive value of 97.0%. HBsAg seroclearance may occur more commonly than expected. A serum HBsAg level <10 IU/ml and PLT count were accurate predictors of clearance."

Entry criteria included HIV-1 infected, NRTI-experienced adults, with CD4(+) counts 50-550 cells/mm(3) and viral loads >or=12,500 copies/mL. Subjects were treated with didanosine 200 mg twice a day (BID), stavudine 40 mg BID, and hydroxyurea 1000 mg daily for 16 weeks. Thirty-one HIV-1 subjects with mean bDNA viral load 1x10(5) log(10) copies/mL and mean CD4(+) T-cell counts of 231 cells/mm(3) were enrolled. A 1.3 log(10) decrease in mean viral load was seen at 12 weeks of therapy. Prior didanosine use resulted in a more rapid response to therapy compared with prior zidovudine use. Side effects consisting of neutropenia, pancreatitis, and peripheral neuropathy occurred in four subjects and resolved upon withdrawal of therapy. This non-randomized study in subjects with a mean CD4(+) T-cell count of 230 cells/mm(3) demonstrates the antiviral activity of hydroxyurea+didanosine and stavudine. Toxicities related to therapy need to be followed closely. The results support the need for a randomized, prospective study to determine the safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea plus didanosine in antiretroviral-experienced patients with CD4(+) cell counts below 300 cells/mm(3)."
2100,0.001,1.0000,"VRC01, a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (bnmAb), can neutralize a diverse array of HIV-1 isolates by mimicking CD4 binding to the envelope glycoprotein gp120. We have previously demonstrated the presence of VRC01-resistant strains in an HIV-1 infected patient during antiretroviral therapy. Here, we report follow-up studies of two subsequent samples from the same patient. With genetic and phenotypic analysis of over 70 full-length molecular clones of the HIV-1 envelope, we show that VRC01-resistant HIV-1 continued to exist and change in its proportion of the infecting virus during treatment with a highly active antiretroviral therapy. Consistent with our previous observation, the resistant phenotype was associated with a single asparagine residue at position 460 (N460), a potential N-linked glycosylation site in the V5 region. The persistence and continuing evolution of VRC01-resistant HIV-1 in vivo presents a great challenge to our future preventative and therapeutic interventions based on VRC01. "
3546,0.001,1.0000,"Within the last two decades, there have been multiple reports of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated smooth muscle tumors in immunocompromised patients. This includes HIV-infected patients, post-transplant patients, and patients with congenital defects of their immune systems. Here we report the case of a 24-year-old African American female with congenital HIV presenting with progressive lower extremity weakness, constipation, aching pain in her shoulders, and subcostal anesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large circumferential lesion extending from T1-T3 and a smaller left paraspinal lesion at C6-C7. The T1-T3 mass was excised via a right-sided costotransversectomy with laminectomy and fusion from T1-T3. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was started postoperatively, and adjuvant radiotherapy was initiated but patient was lost to follow-up. Surgical pathology demonstrated a smooth muscle tumor diffuse nuclear positivity for EBV-encoded small RNA 1 by in situ hybridization. Although eight studies have reported HIV patients with EBV-associated smooth muscle tumors of the spine, to the author's knowledge, this is the first review comprised solely of patients with spinal involvement with the addition of our patient case."
717,0.001,1.0000,"The emerging presence of hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection in the United States has been the focus of much attention among health care providers and the general population. Among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there has been a dramatic increase in hepatitis C disease. During the 1980s and early 1990s, hepatitis C was viewed as a disease for which little could be done, both because of ineffective treatment and the severity and lack of adequate treatments for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) itself. Treatment with interferon had poor effect on hepatitis C in the co-infected population, especially for those with advanced immunosuppression. The regimen was difficult to tolerate even with dose reductions. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and effective treatment and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, a substantial portion of HIV-infected patients are living long enough to have their health compromised by hepatic failure or hepatocellular carcinoma owing to hepatitis C, rather than by AIDS-related illness. New treatments are available for hepatitis C, with preliminary research yielding promising results. The role of these medications in managing HIV/HCV co-infection is currently under study, with implications for many. Health care providers are increasingly faced with the challenges of caring for people infected with the hepatitis C virus, and the growing number of individuals co-infected with hepatitis C and HIV. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of hepatitis C, especially in the presence of HIV infection, and to detail the recognition and management of the care of this emerging population."
3265,0.001,1.0000,"In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, highly increased T-cell turnover was proposed to cause exhaustion of lymphocyte production and consequently development of AIDS. Here, we investigated cell proliferation, as measured by expression of the Ki-67 nuclear antigen, in peripheral blood CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocyte subpopulations before and during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In untreated HIV-1 infection, both the percentage and number of Ki-67(+) CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes were significantly increased, compared with values obtained from healthy individuals. A more than 10-fold increase in the percentage of dividing naive CD4(+) T cells in the blood was found when the number of these cells were below 100 per microL. HAART induced an immediate decline in Ki-67 antigen expression, despite often very low CD4(+) T-cell numbers, arguing against increased proliferation being a homeostatic response. After approximately 24 weeks of HAART treatment, a transient increase in the number of proliferating cells was seen, but only in the CD4(+) CD27(+) memory pool. In the CD8(+) T-cell compartment, the number of dividing cells was elevated 20- to 25-fold. This increase was most notable in the CD27(+) CD 45RO(+) and CD27(-) CD45RO(+) memory CD8(+) T-cell pool, corresponding with the degree of expansion of these subsets. Reduction of plasma HIV-RNA load by HAART was accompanied by a decrease in numbers and percentages of dividing cells in all CD8(+) T-cell subsets. Taken together, our results indicate that peripheral T-cell proliferation is a consequence of generalized immune activation. (Blood. 2000;95:249-255)"
9542,0.001,1.0000,"This study aimed to determine the effect of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection on peripheral levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-18 and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor type II (sTNFRII). Serum levels were monitored for a 1-year period in 25 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) who were naive for HAART at the initiation of the study, and in four HIV-1-infected long-term non-progressors. Serum levels of both IL-18 and sTNFRII at baseline were significantly higher in HIV-1-infected patients than in controls. Baseline levels of IL-18 and sTNFRII were not significantly different in long-term non-progressors compared with the other patients. HCV co-infected patients had significantly higher levels of IL-18 and sTNFRII at each time-point compared with patients who were not co-infected with HCV. Irrespective of HCV status, response to HAART resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of both IL-18 and sTNFRII, particularly among patients who achieved HIV viral suppression, but the net decrease observed at the end of follow-up was lower in patients co-infected with HCV. No information was obtained from IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12 (p70) measurements. The data suggest that analysis of serum levels of IL-18 and sTNFRII may be a valuable tool for evaluating the response to HAART, and perhaps for assessing the degree of immune restoration achieved by HAART responders. The results also highlight the relevance of considering the HCV infection status of HIV-1-infected patients in order to avoid misinterpretation of IL-18 and sTNFRII measurements."
5853,0.001,1.0000,"We conducted a retrospective study to further elucidate the clinical presentations and prognosis of disease due to Mycobacterium kansasii in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Forty-nine HIV-infected patients first had M. kansasii isolated at a mean CD4 cell count of 62/mm3 and at a mean interval of 17 months after the diagnosis of AIDS. Seventeen of the 49 patients had disseminated disease caused by M. kansasii. Twenty-nine patients had a positive acid-fast smear of sputum, and 35 were known to be cigarette smokers. At the time of initial isolation of M. kansasii, 13 patients had other concurrent pulmonary isolates and 15 had another mycobacterial species concurrently isolated (the Mycobacterium avium complex in 13 instances). Patients who received antimycobacterial treatment survived longer than those who did not. Only one of the 49 patients was definitively determined to be colonized with M. kansasii without disease; therefore, it appears that pulmonary isolates of M. kansasii in HIV-infected patients are almost always associated with disease. The increase in rates of M. kansasii disease among HIV-infected patients has paralleled the rise of AIDS in Louisiana. So far, this state has recorded more coinfections with M. kansasii and HIV than any other."
3600,0.001,1.0000,Our aim was to study the impact of lifelong human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease history on the current immune and virological status of perinatally infected patients reaching adulthood. We evaluated blood cell-associated HIV DNA load as an indicator of cell-associated HIV reservoirs and an independent predictor of disease progression.
7,0.001,1.0000,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is known to result in an asymptomatic infection of its natural African monkey host. However, some SIV strains are capable of inducing AIDS-like symptoms and death upon experimental infection of Asian macaques. To further investigate the virulence of natural SIV isolates from African monkeys, pig-tailed (PT) macaques were inoculated intravenously with either of two recently discovered novel lentiviruses, SIVlhoest and SIVsun. Both viruses were apparently apathogenic in their natural hosts but caused immunodeficiency in PT macaques. Infection was characterized by a progressive loss of CD4(+) lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and lymph nodes, generalized lymphoid depletion, a wasting syndrome, and opportunistic infections, such as Mycobacterium avium or Pneumocystis carinii infections. However, unlike SIVsm/mac infection of macaques, SIVlhoest and SIVsun infections in PT macaques were not accompanied by high viral loads during the chronic disease stage. In addition, no significant correlation between the viral load at set point (12 weeks postinfection) and survival could be found. Five out of eight SIVlhoest-infected and three out of four SIVsun-infected macaques succumbed to AIDS during the first 5 years of infection. Thus, the survival of SIVsun- and SIVlhoest-infected animals was significantly longer than that of SIVagm- or SIVsm-infected macaques. All PT macaques maintained strong SIV antibody responses despite progression to SIV-induced AIDS. The development of immunodeficiency in the face of low viremia suggests that SIVlhoest and SIVsun infections of macaques may model unique aspects of the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus infection in humans."
7668,0.001,1.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) enhances human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) activity in patients with dual HIV-1/TB infection. Therapies that control augmentations of HIV-1 activity at sites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection may be useful in inhibition of viral expansion. Regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) analogues (AOP and NNY) are potent in inhibiting the entry of primary HIV-1 isolates into host mononuclear cells. These analogues were used to inhibit MTB-induced HIV-1 entry in blood monunuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with pulmonary TB, and pleural fluid mononuclear cells (PFMC) from patients with pleural TB. PBMC or PFMC were cultured with and without MTB in presence and absence of RANTES analogues. HIV-1 strong stop DNA was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a measure of infection. CCR5 mRNA was assessed by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and by immunostaining and FACS analysis. HIV-1 infection was induced by MTB in vitro in PBMC from the majority (14 of 20) of HIV-1/TB subjects, and new infection was inhibited by AOP- or NNY-RANTES. HIV-1 infection was also inhibited by these reagents in MTB-induced PFMC from three of three patients with pleural TB. Expression of CCR5 mRNA was significantly induced by MTB in PBMC from patients with pulmonary TB. Further, expression of CCR5 was higher in PFMC compared to PBMC from patients with pleural TB. Also, CCR5 was fourfold higher on CD14(+) pleural mononuclear cells than on CD4(+) lymphocytes. Blocking new HIV-1 infection of mononuclear cells may be useful in control of HIV-1 during dual HIV-1/TB infection."
2161,0.001,1.0000,"Continual human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution and expansion within the human population have led to unequal distribution of HIV-1 group M subtypes. In particular, recent outgrowth of subtype C in southern Africa, India, and China has fueled speculation that subtype C isolates may be more fit in vivo. In this study, nine subtype B and six subtype C HIV-1 isolates were added to peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures for a complete pairwise competition experiment. All subtype C HIV-1 isolates were less fit than subtype B isolates (P < 0.0001), but intrasubtype variations in HIV-1 fitness were not significant. Increased fitness of subtype B over subtype C was also observed in primary CD4(+) T cells and macrophages from different human donors but not in skin-derived human Langerhans cells. Detailed analysis of the retroviral life cycle during several B and C virus competitions indicated that the efficiency of host cell entry may have a significant impact on relative fitness. Furthermore, phyletic analyses of fitness differences suggested that, for a recombined subtype B/C HIV-1 isolate, higher fitness mapped to the subtype B env gene rather than the subtype C gag and pol genes. These results suggest that subtype B and C HIV-1 may be transmitted with equal efficiency (Langerhans cell data) but that subtype C isolates may be less fit following initial infection (T-cell and macrophage data) and may lead to slower disease progression."
2999,0.001,1.0000,"The therapeutic armamentarium for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection continues to expand. New targets such as entry and integration have recently been successfully exploited. However, HIV-infected patients in need of treatment are currently committed to lifelong suppressive therapy. The persistence of integrated HIV DNA genomes capable of producing virus is a fundamental obstacle to the eradication or cure of HIV infection. Rational molecular or pharmacologic strategies to eliminate persistent HIV proviral genomes are an unaddressed therapeutic need. Coupled with potent antiretroviral therapy, treatments that could efficiently deplete the persistent DNA reservoir of HIV could radically alter treatment paradigms. Prior attempts to target persistent proviral infection deployed intensive antiretroviral therapy (ART) in combination with global inducers of T-cell activation. Initial trials of this approach were unsuccessful. Non-specific T-cell activation may induce high-level viral replication above a level that can be fully contained by ART, while increasing the susceptibility of uninfected cells. Selective targeting of HIV provirus via agents that induce the expression of quiescent HIV, but have limited effects on the uninfected host cell is an alternate approach to attack latent HIV. Recent studies define the role of repressive chromatin structure in maintaining HIV quiescence, and suggest that mechanisms that remodel chromatin about the HIV promoter are a possible therapeutic target. Other studies have uncovered specific factors that may act to induce or maintain latency by limiting the efficiency of HIV gene expression. Attempts to deplete latent HIV using drugs that alter chromatin structure have entered clinical study."
6908,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of HBV-related markers in cryoglobulinemias and the possible association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) and essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (EMC). A retrospective survey of the prevalence of HBV infection in cryoglobulinemic patients was carried out in 596 cases of cryoglobulinemia. On the basis of clinical and laboratory criteria the cases were grouped as secondary to connective tissue disease, to lymphoproliferative disorders, to chronic liver diseases or to chronic infectious diseases. The cases in which an associated disease was not evidenced were considered as essential mixed cryogobulinemias. Subjects in which liver dysfunction was first diagnosed simultaneously with cryoglobulinemia, were considered as a separate group. A greater prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBc antibodies was found in cryoglobulinemias secondary to chronic liver disease (p < 0.0001) and in those associated with liver involvement at diagnosis (p < 0.05) than that found in EMCs. The prevalence of anti-HBs antibodies did not differ significantly among the groups. Proven contact with the virus, documented by at least one positive marker, was evidenced more frequently in cryoglobulinemias secondary to liver disease than in the other groups (p < 0.01). The prevalence of HBV related markers in EMCs and in hospitalized patients not suffering from diseases associated with cryoglobulin production were similar, and seems to reflect the epidemiological situation of HBV infection in Italy. In conclusion, our findings do not support an association of HBV with EMC."
3018,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B is a serious public health problem throughout the world. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) induces acute hepatitis with a case-fatality rate of about 1%. Even more important, 5-10% of patients infected with HBV become chronic carries and about 25% of these will die due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The reservoir of HBV chronic carriers in the world is estimated at more than 200 million people and 80% of them reside in Asia and the western Pacific. In high-incidence areas, such as south-east Asia, perinatal transmission of HBV from carrier mothers to newborns appears to be the most important factor for the high prevalence of HBV infection and 70-90% of infants born to HBsAg/HBeAg-positive mothers become chronic carriers. Three possibilities of transmission of HBV from carrier mothers to newborns are suggested: (a) transplacental transmission in utero - it was estimated that such transmission occurred in 5-15% of newborns; (b) transmission during delivery, which is considered the main mode of perinatal transmission; (c) postnatal transmission from mother to newborn, which is not common. HBeAg is the main maternal factor in determining whether infection of newborns will occur; the expression of this antigen seems to be determined genetically. Recently it has shown that immunoprophylaxis is highly effective in preventing the development of the carrier state in infants born to HBsAg/HBeAg-positive mothers. Only 5-10% of high-risk infants are not protected by vaccination. If it becomes possible to immunize the entire world population including all babies born to carrier mothers at birth, and if our knowledge of the mechanisms of perinatal transmission of HBV is accurate, the carriers and acute cases of HB ought to disappear in two to three generations."
380,0.001,1.0000,"The objective of the study was to investigate whether closer adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern is associated with metabolic aspects of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-induced metabolic syndrome (fat redistribution [FR], insulin resistance, dyslipidemia) in HIV-positive patients. This was a cross-sectional study. Two hundred twenty-seven HIV-infected patients were evaluated during a single outpatient visit to the General Clinical Research Center of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Usual dietary intake and physical activity habits were evaluated; the Mediterranean Diet Score (MedDietScore) was calculated. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, computed tomographic findings, anthropometrics, and data from the study interviews and questionnaires were used for the assessment of body composition using specific criteria. A complete metabolic profile was available for all subjects. In the entire study sample, a weak inverse association was found between insulin resistance, estimated using the homeostasis model assessment, and MedDietScore (standardized beta = -0.15, P = .03). Interaction models revealed that this was largely driven by an inverse association in patients with FR (standardized beta = -0.13, P = .02). Moreover, MedDietScore was positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (standardized beta = 0.15, P = .01) and marginally negatively associated with circulating triglyceride levels (standardized beta = -0.16, P = .13) in this group of patients. Adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern was favorably related to cardiovascular risk factors in HIV-positive patients with FR. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm our data in different populations and to explore the underlying mechanisms."
977,0.001,1.0000,"OBJECTIVE To present the development and validation of the WebAd-Q Questionnaire, a self-report instrument to monitor adherence to antiretroviral therapy in HIV/AIDS centers in Brazil. METHODS The WebAd-Q is an electronic questionnaire that has three questions about the use of antiretrovirals in the last week. It was constructed from interviews and focus groups with 38 patients. Its validity was tested in a study with a sample of 90 adult patients on antiretroviral therapy for at least three months. We used electronic monitoring bottles, pill counting, and self-report interview to compare adherence. The WebAd-Q was answered on the sixtieth day, twice, with at least one hour of interval. The viral load of the patients was obtained from the service records. We have analyzed the agreement between the answers to the WebAd-Q, the associations, and the correlations with viral load and performance compared to other measures of adherence. RESULTS Among the invited patients, 74 (82.2%) answered the WebAd-Q. No difficulties were reported to answer the questionnaire. The average answer time was 5 min 47 sec. The set of three questions of the WebAd-Q obtained agreement of 89.8%, with Kappa of 0.77 (95%CI 0.61-0.94). The non-adherence answers of the WebAd-Q were associated with detectable viral load. We obtained moderate viral load correlations with the non-adherence scale according to the WebAd-Q. For the three questions of the WebAd-Q, patients with non-adherence answers were also reported as less adherent according to the other measures of adherence. CONCLUSIONS The WebAd-Q answered all the issues considered relevant in the validation of questionnaires, was well understood by patients, was associated with viral load, and obtained good agreement and good performance compared to the other measures. The feasibility analysis of its implementation still depends on a national study on its applicability."
5228,0.001,1.0000,"Jamaica has the second highest number of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases and deaths in the Caribbean and a significant number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals have a concomitant sexually transmitted infection (STI). The study determined the prevalence of non-ulcerative and ulcerative STIs and their association with sexual risky behaviour in a sample of HIV seropositive men and women. This study was conducted at the Comprehensive Health Centre in Jamaica, a sexually transmitted infection referral centre. The sample comprised 138 men and 132 women age 15-49 years, of average 29.5 years. The study was retrospective, from 2000 to 2002, and sample collection was randomized. The sexual behaviours of the subjects were assessed from the case records. In the 270 HIV diagnosed cases examined, the prevalence of STIs was 51.1% in men and 48.9% in women, with 85.4% having one or more STIs with an average of four STIs per patient. There was a total occurrence of 744 STIs with non-gonococcal urethritis (19.4%), gonorrhoea (17.2%), candidiasis (13.4%), trichomonas (12.4%), genital ulcer (10.4%) and syphilis (7.3%) the most common in HIV infected men and women. The presence of STI was associated with continued practice of risky sexual behaviour. The age group most implicated was the 30-34 year old, and 73.1% of the HIV infected patients had multiple sexual partners with only 16.4% reporting frequent condom use. The study demonstrates that there is a high prevalence of non-ulcerative and to a lesser extent ulcerative STIs in HIV infected patients in Jamaica. There are significant associations between STIs and continued high risk sexual practices in HIV infected men and women. The findings support the need for implementation of effective diagnosis and treatment strategies coupled with education about safe-sex practices in HIV prevention and STI control programmes."
4826,0.001,1.0000,"One of the hallmarks of HIV-1 infection is represented by the finding of massive T cell activation in peripheral blood lymphocytes of infected patients. An impairment of NK cell function during HIV-1 infection is also detected, and is associated with decreased expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR). In this study we tried to determine whether also NK cells are affected by relevant activation and whether this could be associated with decreased NK cell function. In 18 viremic HIV-1-infected patients, freshly drawn purified peripheral NK cells displayed significant levels of activation with an incomplete pattern (HLA-DR(+)CD69(+)CD25(-)NKp44(-)). Activated (HLA-DR(+)CD69(+)) peripheral NK cells expressed an NCR(dull) phenotype as determined by cytofluorometric analysis in all the patients, and did not derive from a homogeneous/oligoclonal expansion in vivo as analyzed by expression of HLA-specific inhibitory NK cell receptors. As determined by cytotoxicity assays, activated NK cells showed a decreased cytolytic function in HIV-1-infected patients. Thus, the decrease in NK cell function observed during HIV-1 infection is associated not only with decreased NCR expression, but also with significant and incomplete NK cell activation in vivo. These results suggest a consistent continuous involvement of the innate immune response in the failure to control viral replication."
6928,0.001,1.0000,"The authors examined sexual behaviors, the seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and condom use among 2,314 homosexual and bisexual men tested during 1988-1989 at the AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) National Center in Mexico City. Bisexuals constituted 24% of the sample; the seroprevalence rate was lower for bisexuals than homosexuals (21 vs. 34%). In logistic regressions, HIV-1 seropositivity was independently related to age, education, pattern of insertive/receptive behavior in anal sex, lifetime number of male sex partners, having sex with someone with AIDS, homosexual versus bisexual behavior, and a history of condyloma. The same logistic regressions were found to fit bisexuals and homosexuals. The rate of HIV-1 was reduced in individuals who indicated always requiring their partners to use a condom when practicing receptive anal sex (1% of the total). The most common practice for both homosexuals and bisexuals was ""mixed"" behavior (i.e., both insertive and receptive anal sex); this was also the practice with the highest risk. Bisexuals practiced both vaginal and anal sex with women and reported little condom use. The substantial seroprevalence among bisexuals, their frequent sexual contact with women, and their low rate of condom use imply a continuing role as a bridge of infection to females. Whether this risk will lead to a sustained heterosexual epidemic remains to be determined."
1454,0.001,1.0000,"Little research has been conducted in less wealthy nations to evaluate the prevalence of severe life traumas in general population groups and the impact of such traumas. Previous studies in wealthy nations have found that experiencing severe traumas can cause elevated levels of anxiety, but few studies have examined this association in non-disaster situations in less wealthy nations. Trauma and trauma-related anxiety are associated with greater sexual risk taking behaviours, lower HIV medication adherence levels and poorer health outcomes in wealthy nations. The objectives of this manuscript are: (1) to compare rates of trauma in two HIV-positive samples from areas that have not experienced disaster situations that are recognized by the international community as traumatic events; and (2) to examine whether the reported traumatic experiences are similarly associated with self-reported mental and physical health. The samples come from a region of a wealthy nation that consistently experiences large increases in incident AIDS cases and where the epidemic is largely transmitted heterosexually (Deep South, United States; n =611) and a region in a less wealthy nation with relatively high HIV prevalence and incidence rates and where transmission is also primarily heterosexual (Moshi, Tanzania; n =72). Compared to the US sample, the Tanzanian sample reported significantly higher rates of trauma in the areas of illness, injury, accidents and ""other"" significant traumas, a higher prevalence of anxiety and poorer physical health. The experience of trauma was similarly associated with greater mental health symptomatology and poorer physical health in both samples. Further investigation into the area of trauma and its sequelae is warranted, particularly in relation to risk behaviours and HIV medication adherence. At a time of increasing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in less wealthy nations, additional focus on trauma care could improve ART adherence rates and reduce risk behaviors, thereby assisting in stemming the further spread of the epidemic."
31,0.001,1.0000,"HIV replication is suppressed in vitro by a CD8(+) cell noncytotoxic antiviral response (CNAR). This activity directly correlates with an asymptomatic clinical state. The objective of this study was to identify the phenotype of CD8(+) cell subsets having strong CNAR activity. CD8(+) cell subset frequencies and CNAR levels were measured for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected individuals and three groups of HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals: asymptomatic individuals with low-level viremia (vHIV), antiretroviral-drug-treated subjects with undetectable virus levels (TxHIV), and therapy-naïve aviremic elite controllers (EC). CD8(+) cells from the vHIV individuals exhibited the highest HIV-suppressing activity and had elevated frequencies of CD45RA(-) CD27(+) and PD-1(+) (CD279(+)) cells. Functional assessments of CD8(+) cells sorted into distinct subsets established that maximal CNAR activity was mediated by CD45RA(-) CCR7(-) CD27(+) and PD-1(+) CD8(+) cells. T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire profiles of CD8(+) cell subsets having strong CNAR activity exhibited increased perturbations in comparison to those of inactive subsets. Together, these studies suggest that CNAR is driven by HIV replication and that this antiviral activity is associated with oligoclonally expanded activated CD8(+) cells expressing PD-1 and having a transitional memory cell phenotype. The findings better describe the identity of CD8(+) cells showing CNAR and should facilitate the evaluation of this important immune response in studies of HIV pathogenesis, resistance to infection, and vaccine development."
782,0.001,1.0000,"This study is the first prospective study to assess the prevalence, epidemiology, and risk factors of HIV-1 drug resistance in newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients in Belgium. In January 2003 it was initiated as part of the pan-European SPREAD program, and continued thereafter for four inclusion rounds until December 2006. Epidemiological, clinical, and behavioral data were collected using a standardized questionnaire and genotypic resistance testing was done on a sample taken within 6 months of diagnosis. Two hundred and eighty-five patients were included. The overall prevalence of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance in Belgium was 9.5% (27/285, 95% CI: 6.6-13.4). Being infected in Belgium, which largely coincided with harboring a subtype B virus, was found to be significantly associated with transmission of drug resistance. The relatively high rate of baseline resistance might jeopardize the success of first line treatment as more than 1 out of 10 (30/285, 10.5%) viruses did not score as fully susceptible to one of the recommended first-line regimens, i.e., zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz. Our results support the implementation of genotypic resistance testing as a standard of care in all treatment-naive patients in Belgium."
8076,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection occurs frequently in patients with preexisting mental illness. Treatment for chronic hepatitis C using interferon formulations often increases risk for neuro-psychiatric symptoms. Pegylated-Interferon-α (PegIFN-α) remains crucial for attaining sustained virologic response (SVR); however, PegIFN-α based treatment is associated with psychiatric adverse effects, which require dose reduction and/or interruption. This study's main objective was to identify genes induced by PegIFN-α and expressed in the central nervous system and immune system, which could mediate the development of psychiatric toxicity in association with antiviral outcome. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/HCV co-infected donors (N = 28), DNA microarray analysis was performed and 21 differentially regulated genes were identified in patients with psychiatric toxicity versus those without. Using these 21 expression profiles a two-way-ANOVA was performed to select genes based on antiviral outcome and occurrence of neuro-psychiatric adverse events. Microarray analysis demonstrated that Interferon-stimulated-exonuclease-gene 20 kDa (ISG20) and Interferon-alpha-inducible-protein 27 (IFI27) were the most regulated genes (P < 0.05) between three groups that were built by combining antiviral outcome and neuro-psychiatric toxicity. Validation by bDNA assay confirmed that ISG20 expression levels were significantly associated with these outcomes (P < 0.035). Baseline levels and induction of ISG20 correlated independently with no occurrence of psychiatric adverse events and non-response to therapy (P < 0.001). Among the 21 genes that were associated with psychiatric adverse events and 20 Interferon-inducible genes (IFIGs) used as controls, only ISG20 expression was able to link PegIFN-α related neuro-psychiatric toxicity to distinct HCV-responses in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV in vivo."
5027,0.001,1.0000,"Recently, we developed a highly pathogenic variant of simian-human immunodeficiency virus, SHIV-4 (containing the tat, rev, vpu, and env of the HXB2 strain of HIV-1 in a genetic background of SIVmac239), through a series of four bone marrow-bone marrow passages-first in rhesus monkeys and then in pig-tailed macaques [Joag et al. (1996) J. Virol. 70, 3189-3197]. Inoculation of pig-tailed macaques with this pathogenic virus (SHIVKU-1) causes subtotal elimination of CD4(+) T cells and fatal opportunistic infections, usually within 6 months. Genetic characterization of SHIVKU-1 showed that it has a functional vpu gene (the first codon is ATG vs ACG for the vpu of SHIV-4) and several amino acid substitutions in Env and nef [Stephens et al. (1997) Virology 231, 313-321]. Two pig-tailed macaques, PPc and PQc, were the first to develop a severe loss of CD4(+) T cells and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and were euthanized at 26 and 105 weeks, respectively. In this report, we analyzed the changes that occurred in the vpu, nef, and env (gp120) genes of the virus used to inoculate macaques PPc and PQc and established the chronology of changes that occurred in these viral genes as these two animals lost their CD4(+) T cells and progressed to develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Compared with SHIV-4, the virus used to inoculate macaques PPc and PQc had 0, 3, and 0 consensus amino acid changes in the Vpu, gp120, and Nef, respectively. An analysis of the viral sequences amplified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells samples taken at various times after inoculation of PPc revealed that the vpu had not reverted to an open reading frame (closed vpu, ACG) at 4 weeks after inoculation, but by 16 weeks vpu had reverted to an open reading frame (open vpu, ATG). Macaque PQc, which had a longer course of disease, had a closed vpu at 4 and 16 weeks, but by 28 weeks, both closed and open vpu were detected. From 39 to 105 weeks, only an open vpu was detected. In both macaques, the reversion to an open vpu correlated well with the second phase (major) of CD4(+) T cell loss. An analysis of the nef and env sequences isolated from the same times after inoculation revealed an association between the reversion of vpu to an open reading frame and the accumulation of increased numbers of consensus changes in these two viral proteins. These data suggest that the concomitant reversion of vpu to an open reading frame along with increased substitutions in Nef and gp120 were important genetic changes in the viral genome that were responsible for the increased and highly efficient rate of replication of the virus in CD4(+) T cells and macrophages, which in turn led to elimination of the CD4(+) T cells and profound loss of immunocompetence in the infected animals."
6856,0.001,1.0000,"To determine role of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and additional factors in incidence and outcome of patients with AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) we retrospectively analyzed 257 cases of AIDS-related NHL (24 low-grade, 168 high-grade B-cell, 6 high-grade T-cell, and 59 primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSL) among 2004 patients with HIV-infection treated at the University Hospital of Frankfurt, Germany from January 1983 to May 1999. Data were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses, using overall survival as end point. Patients received CHOP-like therapy as standard treatment. Until May 1999 incidence of all diagnosed cases of NHL was decreasing (1991-94: 14.2% versus 1995-5/99: 12.8%). Mainly, the incidence of low-grade NHL and PCNSL clearly decreased whereas the incidence of high-grade B-cell NHL increased compared to all diagnosed cases of NHL (1983-86: 53.3% versus 1995-5/99: 78.6%). One-year survival probability of all screened patients with AIDS related NHL was 54%, while 5-year survival rate remained 5%. We found age <25 years, development of NHL in the years before 1990, IVDU, CD4 counts <150/microl, PCNSL as well as NHL as the AIDS index disease, to be highly significant independent predictors of poor survival, including increased hazard ratios. In the era of HAART incidence of NHL is decreasing, mainly the incidence of low-grade NHL and PCNSL. Overall survival of patients has been prolonged with HAART. This development is mainly due to improvement of antiretroviral therapy, rather than to any fundamental changes in the chemotherapeutic treatment of NHL. Therefore, new treatment approaches for AIDS-related NHL should focus on more efficient antiretroviral therapy in association with combination chemotherapy."
2471,0.001,1.0000,"Toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) continues to be a severe health problem despite the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). To identify predictors for development of TE we compared demographic, clinical and diagnostic variables in AIDS patients with TE before (n = 102) or after the introduction (n = 70) of HAART at the Charité University Medicine in Berlin, Germany. Interestingly, patient characteristics did not differ significantly in the pre- and post-HAART groups. Sixty-eight percent of patients had CD4-cell counts of <50/μl. Outcome after treatment with pyrimethamin plus sulfonamides or clindamycin (47% each) did not differ; adverse reactions were more frequent in patients receiving sulfonamides than in those receiving clindamycin (25% vs. 10.5%; p = 0.02). Interestingly, patients in the post HAART group had not received (82.9%) or had not taken HAART adequately (17.1%). Concurrent diagnosis of TE and HIV was significantly more often in the post- compared to the pre-HAART group (49 vs. 26%, respectively; p > 0.001). Thus, despite the introduction of HAART, awareness of opportunistic infections in HIV patients is warranted. High rates of unawareness of HIV infection should make public health efforts focus on early identification of HIV infection and initiation of and compliance with HAART."

With adventure of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), life expectancy has prolonged in HIV positive patients but several acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related conditions such as coagulopathies are responsible for associated morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of coagulation, serum level of fibrinogen and platelet count in HIV positive patients and compare it with negative healthy individuals. Through a case-control study, 114 HIV seropositive patients were compared with 114 seronegative samples in terms of hematological and other coagulation parameters. Mean age of study patients was 37.48 years. Intra venous drug abuse was the most common route of infection transmission with a prevalence of more than 50%. HIV route of transmission had a direct relationship with PTT abnormal levels (P&lt;0.0001). However, this relationship was not significant for PT values. Stages of HIV disease and administration of HAART did not reveal any significant relationship with PT and PTT. There was also a statistically significant correlation between CD4+&lt; 200 and PT in case group (P=0.008). On the other hands, in control group, CD4+ had a weak relationship with PTT (P=0.02) and an inverse correlation with serum fibrinogen (P=0.013). Hematological parameters and serum fibrinogen are decreased in HIV positive patients especially in direct relation with CD4+ cell count&lt;200 cell/µl. PT and PTT abnormal values are also more prevalent in this population. "
4987,0.001,1.0000,"The introduction of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy has transformed HIV-infection from an inevitably lethal disease to a chronic condition with a life expectancy comparable to that of people with diabetes mellitus. In recent years it has become evident that people living with HIV/AIDS have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and it is expected that the prevalence of chronic kidney disease will rise accordingly. To investigate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in patients with HIV, we conducted a retrospective observational analysis using the clinical database of a large centre (Institute of Tropical Medicine) in the urban area of Antwerp, Belgium. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease among HIV infected subjects was found to be 3.0%. The development of chronic kidney disease was associated with age above 50 years, lower CD4 cell counts and Caucasian origin. Screening for chronic renal disorders and prevention of evolution toward chronic renal failure is a crucial challenge in the management of people living with HIV/AIDS."
8892,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-infected patients who are on hemodialysis have a worse prognosis than noninfected patients who are on hemodialysis. Their outcome in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era remains unclear. Outcomes in patients who were enrolled in the French Dialysis in HIV/AIDS (DIVA) cohort were determined in a 2-yr prospective follow-up. All HIV-infected patients who were on hemodialysis in France on January 1, 2002, were included and followed prospectively until January 1, 2004. Patients' survival was examined by Kaplan-Meier method, and mortality risk factors were examined using uni- and multicovariate analyses. Survival was compared with that of 584 hemodialysis patients who did not have HIV or diabetes and were enrolled in the French Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study II (DOPPS II) in the same period (after standardization for the average age, gender, and ethnicity of the DIVA cohort). A total of 27,577 patients were receiving hemodialysis in France at the beginning of the study; 164 (0.59%) were infected with HIV, 72% were male, mean age was 44.8 +/- 10.9 yr, and 65% were black. The 2-yr survival rate was 89 +/- 2% and statistically indistinguishable from the survival of the French cohort extracted from the DOPPS II study. Significant mortality risk factors were low CD4 cell count (hazard ratio [HR] 1.4/100 CD4 cells per mm(3) lower), high viral load (HR 2.5/1 Log per ml), absence of HAART (HR 2.7), and a history of opportunistic infection (HR 3.7), the last two being independent (HR 2.6 and 3.6, respectively). Survival of HIV-infected patients who are hemodialysis has greatly improved. A prospective cohort of paired hemodialysis patients with and without HIV is required to compare better their mortality in the HAART era."

5842,0.001,1.0000,"Egypt is confronted with the highest hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic. Apoptosis and cellular immune responses are crucial to the clearance or persistence of viral infections. This case-control study was carried out to detect whether apoptosis genes single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) confer risk to HCV in a cohort of Egyptian patients and to explore their association with viral load. One hundred and ninety six blood samples were withdrawn from 96 HCV patients and 100 controls. The Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) -1525G>A and FasL-844T>C SNPs were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Hepatitis C viral load was measured using Real time PCR. Results Genotypes distributions of TRAIL -1525G>A and FasL-844 T>C polymorphisms in controls were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). The study showed a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the TRAIL -1525G>A polymorphism genotypes and the FasL-844 T>C polymorphism genotypes between the HCV patients and the controls (p=0.001 and 0.02 respectively), with association of the -1525GA genotype and -844 TT genotype with increased risk of HCV infection (OR=2.68, 1.942 respectively, 95% CI=1.482-4.846, 1.1-3.43, respectively). No significant association was detected between TRAIL, FasL and the viral load. Our results suggest that the FasL -844T>C SNP is implicated in the susceptibility to HCV in Egyptian patients and firstly report the involvement of TRAIL gene polymorphism in the risk of the disease. Therefore we recommend national programs to delineate genetic factors that may put individuals at risk for contracting HCV."
6905,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) mortality is used as a key measure to monitor the impact of HIV throughout the world. It is important that HIV be correctly recorded on death certificates so that the burden of HIV mortality can be tracked accurately. The objective of this study was to determine the extent of failure to correctly report HIV on death certificates and examine patterns of incompleteness by demographic factors. Causes of death on death certificates of people infected with HIV reported to the Florida HIV surveillance system 2000-2011 were analyzed to determine the proportion without mention of HIV who had an underlying cause of death suggestive of HIV based on World Health Organization recommendations. Of the 11,989 deaths, 8089 (67.5%) had an HIV code (B20-B24, R75) as any of the causes of death, 3091 (25.8%) had no mention of HIV and the underlying cause was not suggestive of HIV, and 809 (6.7%) had no mention of HIV but the underlying cause was suggestive of HIV. Therefore, 9.1% (809/8898) of probable HIV-related deaths had no mention of HIV on the death certificate. Dying within 1 month of HIV diagnosis was the factor most strongly associated with no mention of HIV when the underlying cause was suggestive of HIV on the death certificate. The results suggest that HIV mortality using only vital records may underestimate actual HIV mortality by approximately 9%. Efforts to reduce incompleteness of reporting of HIV on death certificates could improve HIV-related mortality estimates. "
7302,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence and associated factors of erectile dysfunction (ED) in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected men remain controversial. The authors evaluated ED, clinical, and emotional variables in a group of 501 HIV-infected men in a cross-sectional 4-month observational study. ED was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function-5 and emotional status using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire. Median age (interquartile range) was 42 (35, 48) years. Time since HIV diagnosis was 6.3 (2.6, 17.1) years, 92% were taking antiretroviral treatment and 81.8% had an HIV-RNA viral load <50 copies. The prevalence of ED was 58.5%. ED was mild in 30.1%, mild to moderate in 19.5%, moderate in 6.1%, and severe in 2.5%. ED medications were used by 19% of men. In the univariate analysis, the variables associated with all degrees of ED were older age, longer time since HIV diagnosis, higher scores in HAD, not taking efavirenz, taking etravirine, taking ritonavir, HIV/Hepatitis C Virus coinfection, and taking a protease inhibitor-containing regimen. For mild to moderate, moderate, and severe ED, the same variables were significant, as were lower nadir CD4 cell count, lower social support, taking atazanavir, concomitant conditions, and concomitant treatments. The variables that remained significant in the multivariate analyses, considering all degrees of ED or excluding mild ED were the following: older age and higher scores in HAD total. In summary, ED affected more than half of this cohort of well controlled HIV-infected men. Age and emotional status seemed to play a fundamental role in its presence."
8199,0.001,1.0000,"Longitudinal data on 2,125 participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) with documented antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were used to examine the incidence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) over time and to determine if sexual practices and hematologic variables prior to diagnosis differed for participants who develop KS vs. non-KS AIDS (NKS). In the first 4 years of the study, 84 seropositive men were observed to develop KS and 307 presented with an AIDS diagnosis other than KS. A systematic trend in the incidence of KS over time was not apparent in this population. The number of anal-receptive intercourse partners prior to diagnosis declined in a similar fashion for both AIDS groups. Although the number of partners with whom the men performed rimming decreased prior to diagnosis for both AIDS groups, a greater proportion of the KS AIDS group had performed this activity with multiple partners than had the non-KS AIDS group. Furthermore, history of oral gonorrhea was significantly (p = 0.027) more prevalent in the KS group. In addition, the KS AIDS group had lower cytomegalovirus antibody levels prior to diagnosis and higher levels of total immunoglobulin G. The groups did not differ with respect to baseline hematological measures, temporal trends in helper and suppressor T cells, or hepatitis B surface antigen or antibody. Given this profile of factors associated with the occurrence of KS, an infectious agent, in addition to HIV-1, is plausible as a proposed cofactor in the development of KS."
6708,0.001,1.0000,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical roles in hepatocarcinogenesis. The catalase (CAT) enzyme is involved in the repair of ROS. Therefore, we investigate the association between CAT gene polymorphisms and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 715 subjects were divided into 4 groups: 111 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 90 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, 266 HBV-HCC patients, and 248 healthy controls. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism strategy was used to detect CAT gene rs1001179, rs769217, and rs7943316 polymorphisms. Binary logistic regression analyses adjusting for sex, age, ethnicity, smoking and alcohol consumption, and body mass index suggested that subjects carrying the rs769217 T allele were at marginally increased risk of CHB, LC, and HCC, with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.51 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-2.20, P = 0.029), 1.48 (95% CI = 1.03-2.14, P = 0.035), and 1.51 (95% CI = 1.14-1.98, P = 0.004), respectively. Similarly, those individuals carrying the rs769217 TT genotype had a moderately increased risk of CHB, LC, and HCC, with adjusted ORs of 2.11 (95% CI = 1.05-4.22, P = 0.035), 2.00 (95% CI, 1.01-3.95, P = 0.047), and 1.93 (95% CI = 1.14-3.28, P = 0.015), respectively. Moreover, subjects carrying the rs769217 CT genotype and at least 1 copy of the T allele (dominant model) were 1.78 times and 1.83 times more likely to develop HCC, respectively (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.16-2.73, P = 0.009 and OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.23-2.71, P = 0.003). This association between CAT rs769217 T alleles and HCC risk is significantly strengthened among men, nonsmokers, nondrinkers, and among individuals <50 years of age. Furthermore, we found 1 high-risk haplotype GTA for CHB (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.05-2.01) and 1 protective haplotype GCA for HCC risk (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.52-0.87). We did not found any significant difference in CAT rs1001179 and rs7943316 polymorphisms between controls and cases. Our findings suggest that the CAT rs769217 T allele is associated with increased risk of CHB, HBV-LC, and HBV-HCC in Guangxi population."
2744,0.001,1.0000,"The authors examined the survival experience of 289 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men to identify factors independently associated with survival in patients with very low CD4 counts (< or = 100/mm3). All subjects were HIV-infected men cared for at the San Francisco Veterans' Affairs Medical Center between January 1988 and November 1991. Survival was measured from the date on which a patient was first known to have a CD4 count < or = 100/mm3 until death or censoring. Factors potentially associated with survival were examined initially using the product limit (Kaplan-Meier) method; a multivariate model of survival was constructed using a proportional hazards (Cox) regression. Four variables were identified as independently associated with survival (p < 0.05) in the Cox proportional hazards model: CD4 count, hematocrit, azidothymidine use, and clinical stage (prior history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome vs. no prior history). All 16 possible combinations of these four (dichotomized) variables were examined; eight different patterns of survival were detected. Identification of survival patterns that can be described by data obtained as part of routine clinical care has implications for patient care, the design of clinical trials, the study of mechanisms of progression of HIV-related immunosuppression, and planning of health care resource needs for populations of patients with very low CD4 counts."

These data were compared with information in medical and pharmacy records. There was no evidence of bias in the patient report of date of diagnosis of HIV infection or date or result of most recent CD4 count, although there was considerable imprecision. Past and current prescription of AZT were recalled accurately by patients compared with medical records (kappa = 0.89 and 0.86, respectively), but previous HIV-related illnesses and enrollment in clinical studies or trials were generally recalled poorly (kappa < 0.4 in some cases). Data collected prospectively on prescription of drugs and use of health care services were reasonably accurately reported by patients. This analysis supports the need for routine assessment of the validity of patient-reported exposure and outcome data in epidemiological studies in order to minimize the possible biases that can result from inaccurate information."

All individuals presenting with a CD4 count >200 cells μL(-1) , who had at least two CD4 counts, and no evidence of co-infection were included. Individuals bearing HLA B35 or HLA B51 were compared to controls. A multivariate model demonstrated that HLA B35 allele was associated with a hazard ratio of 2.05 (95% CI 1.31-3.18) for reaching AIDS and HLA B51 allele with HR of 2.03 (95% CI 1.18-3.49) for reaching the same end-point. High prevalence of HLA B35 was seen in the patient population receiving care in Manitoba. Our observations confirm the association of HLA B35 with rapid disease progression. We report, for the first time, faster CD4 decline among individuals with HLA B51 allele. "
2044,0.001,1.0000,"The polymorphism of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) X gene from patients born in Lorraine has been studied in serum samples from 22 HBV infected patients, 14 presenting with chronic hepatitis and 8 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Subtypes adw and ayw represented 21 of the 22 sequenced isolates. The sequence of the X gene of HBV strains from these patients differed from the ones of Far East origin by A to T(1678) and G to A(1759) changes for subtype ayw and C to T(1792) for adw. The expression of the preC region, as indicated by the detection of HBe antigen (HBeAg), was not observed in 11 patients. In 6 patients (3 HCC and 3 non HCC), the absence of HBeAg could be related to a stop codon at position 28. For the 5 remaining patients, the precore stop mutation at codon 28 was not evidenced but 3 out these 5 patients had mutations at nt 1764 and nt 1766 in the promoter of the preC/C gene. These two mutations were also observed in 2 patients with HBeAg, indicating that they are not implicated in the suppression of expression of this gene. Independently of the serotype, two main differences were noted between aminoacid (aa) sequences of chronic hepatitis and HCC related strains: first, twice as many aa changes were found in HCC patients than in chronic hepatitis B carriers (mean of aa changes per patient 4.1 vs. 2.0) and second, we found apparition of polar aa in HCC patients. Most mutations already described in patients from the Far East with HCC have been found in strains of patients from Lorraine. The changes K130M and V131I, considered as ""hot spot mutations,"" were found in strains of HCC patients carrying an ayw subtype of the HBV genome but not in the ones of chronically infected patients. In contrast, strains of the adw subtype had these two changes in the two groups of patients. However when considering the 22 sequenced genes, these hot spot mutations were associated with HCC (P = 0.034)."

All newly diagnosed patients for HIV-infection from 2004 to 2013 at a reference medical care area in Northwest of Spain were identified. Epidemiological, virological, immunological, and clinical data, as well as HIV genotype and drug resistance information were recorded. A total of 565 newly HIV-diagnosed patients were identified. The number of new cases increased in the last 5 years (66 cases/year). Overall, 53.1% had a median CD4 counts < 350 cells/µl and 33.6% had an AIDS defining criteria. Non-B variants were found in 34.4% of patients being subtype F (25.8%) the most common non-B subtype. The rate of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) over the study period was 3.7%, but a decreased to 2.6% was observed in the last 5 years. The most prevalent TDR mutations were: T215 revertants (1.5%), K219QENR (1.2%), for NRTIs; K103N (1.9%), for NNRTIs; L90M (0.3%), for PIs. Overall, 73.2% of patients started antiretroviral treatment and 9.9% of patients died during follow-up. The number of newly HIV diagnosed patients increased since year 2009. There is a high prevalence of late diagnosis (53%) and 33% had an AIDS defining criteria. Interestingly, the most prevalent non-B subtype in our population was F (25.8%). These findings support the need to facilitate the access for HIV testing to reduce the rate of late HIV diagnosis, improve the clinical outcome and prevent HIV transmission."
7673,0.001,1.0000,"The development of AIDS in HIV-1-infected humans is associated with profound changes in the expression patterns of lymphocyte phenotypic markers associated with increased immune activation and with decreased recall immune responses. In assessing these immunologic changes in an animal model, we characterized the expression patterns of immune activation markers on lymphocyte subsets during the acute, chronic, and end stages of HIV-2 infection in baboons. Using flow cytometry, we identified 21 human-specific monoclonal antibodies that were cross-reactive with baboon lymphocytes; however, expression of only 2 of these markers was altered significantly after HIV-2 infection. We found an increase in baboon class II antigen (as measured by anti-HLA-DR) in the CD4(+) T cell subset within 8 weeks of infection (p = 0.045). Moreover, after 1 year of infection, CD11b was downregulated on CD8(+) T lymphocytes (p = 0.027). This downregulation of CD11b was consistently observed in all of the groups of baboons that were chronically infected with three different HIV-2 isolates. In addition, we found substantial downregulation of the interleukin 2 receptor (CD25) and upregulation of class II antigen on CD8(+) lymphocytes in a baboon with an AIDS-like disease. These and other phenotypic markers of immune activation may facilitate characterization of the immunopathogenesis of AIDS in nonhuman primate animal models."
7849,0.001,1.0000,"Two hundred and seventy-three serum specimens from hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers were examined for the presence of a characteristic one point mutation at nucleotide (nt) 1896 from the EcoRI site of the HBV genome in the precore region (the preC mutant) using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. This assay approach could detect preC mutants or wild-type sequences when either form constituted more than 10% of the total sample. Overall, 65.5% (76/116) of HBeAg-positive carriers had only the preC wild-type. All HBeAg-positive asymptomatic carriers (n = 14) had only the preC wild-type. In patients with chronic hepatitis B and in anti-HBe-positive asymptomatic carriers, increased prevalence of the preC mutant was associated with the development of anti-HBe antibodies and normalization of the serum alanine aminotransferase concentration. Furthermore, 27 (29.0%) of 93 HBeAg-negative carriers had unexpectedly preC wild-type sequences only. Direct sequencing of the HBV precore region of HBV specimens from 24 patients revealed no mutation at nt 1896, supporting the specificity of the RFLP analysis. These results suggest that RFLP analysis was accurate for the detection of the preC mutation and that the absence of serum HBeAg cannot be explained solely by the dominance of the preC mutant."

Overall, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected in 24 subjects (10%), of whom 22 (92%) had detectable HBV DNA. Surprisingly, HDV RNA was detectable in 20 (83%) of the 24 HBsAg-positive subjects. HCV-associated antibodies were detected in 41 (16%) and HCV RNA was detected in 36 (14%) subjects, none of whom was coinfected with HBV, indicating that HBV/HCV carriers account for one-fourth of this population. Antibodies to HAV and HEV were detected in 249 (100%) and 28 (11%) subjects, respectively. Of 22 HBV DNA-positive subjects, genotype D was detected in 21 subjects and genotype F was detected in 1 subject. All 20 HDV isolates recovered from HDV RNA-positive subjects segregated into genotype I, but these differed by 2.1 to 11.4% from each other in the 522- to 526-nucleotide sequence. Of 36 HCV RNA-positive samples, 35 (97%) were genotype 1b and 1 was genotype 2a. Reflecting an extremely high prevalence of hepatitis virus infections, there were no appreciable differences in the prevalence of hepatitis virus markers between the two studied populations with distinct living place and lifestyle. A nationwide epidemiological survey of hepatitis viruses should be conducted in an effort to prevent de novo infection with hepatitis viruses in Mongolia."

Among the positive patients, 68% (22/32) were found positive for both anti-HCV and HCV-RNA, 16% (5/32) and 16% (5/32) were found positive only for anti-HCV or HCV-RNA, respectively. HBV-DNA sequences were detected in two patients associated to the HCV viraemia. This study confirms the extremely high prevalence of HCV infection in NANB chronic hepatitis in France. It also shows the possible co-infection by HCV and HBV in NANB hepatitis. We have also determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5' non-coding, E1, E2/NS1 and NS3/NS4 regions of a French isolate using the polymerase chain reaction. Comparison of these nucleotide sequences with those available from American and Japanese isolates showed a significant genetic variability. The genetic variability is higher in the E2/NS1 (13 to 33% and 12 to 30% at the nucleic acid and amino acid level, respectively) than in the E1 (10 to 28% and 7 to 21%) and NS3/NS4 (5 to 21% and 2 to 7%) regions. The sequence of the French isolate is more closely related to that of the American HCV prototype than to the Japanese HCV isolates. This study confirms the extent of HCV genetic variability."
1987,0.001,1.0000,"Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection often develop multiple complications and comorbidities. Opportunistic infections should always be considered in the evaluation of symptomatic patients with advanced HIV/AIDS, although the overall incidence of these infections has decreased. Primary care of HIV infection includes the early detection of some complications through screening at-risk and symptomatic patients with routine laboratory monitoring (e.g., comprehensive metabolic and lipid panels) and validated tools (e.g., the HIV Dementia Scale). Treatment of many chronic complications is similar for patients with HIV infection and those without infection; however, combination antiretroviral therapy has shown benefit for some conditions, such as HIV-associated nephropathy. For other complications, such as cardiovascular disease and lipoatrophy, management may include switching antiretroviral regimens to reduce exposure to HIV medications known to cause toxicity."
7611,0.001,1.0000,"In HIV/AIDS, symptoms of depression or post-traumatic stress may interfere with important self-care behaviors such as the ability to adhere to one's medical treatment regimen. However, these problems may frequently go undetected in HIV care settings. The present study used brief self-report screening measures of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the HIV/AIDS care settings to examine (1) frequency of positive screens for these diagnoses; (2) the degree to which those with a positive screen were prescribed antidepressant treatment; and (3) the association of continuous PTSD and depression symptom scores, and categorical (screening positive or negative) PTSD and depression screening status, to each other and to ART adherence as assessed by the Medication Event Monitoring System, regardless of antidepressant treatment. Participants were 164 HIV-infected individuals who took part in a multisite adherence intervention study in HIV treatment settings in Massachusetts. Available data from 5 time points was used, yielding 444 data points. Participants screened positive for PTSD at 20% of visits, and depression at 22% of visits. At visits when participants screened positive for both depression and PTSD, 53.6% of the time they were on an antidepressant. Those who screened positive for PTSD were more likely to also screen positive for depression. In multiple regression analyses that included both continuous and dichotomous PTSD and depression and controlled for shared variance due to clustering of multiple observations, only depression contributed significant unique variance, suggesting the primary role of depression and the secondary role of PTSD in poor adherence in individuals with HIV."
3985,0.001,1.0000,"Our objective was to characterize the clinical presentation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among incarcerated women in a program that provides HIV testing and primary care to all state prisoners in Rhode Island. A retrospective medical chart review on all HIV-seropositive women who were incarcerated between 1989 and 1994 and had at least two medical visits with an HIV medical care provider was used. At the Rhode Island Adult Correctional Institution (ACI), under mandatory testing laws between 1989 and 1994, 28% (172 of 623) of all women were identified with HIV infection. Of the 172 women who tested seropositive in prison, 110 were included in the study. Of the 110 women followed, 84% reported injection drug use (IDU) as their primary risk factor, and 30% reported both IDU and sex work. The median CD4 count was 596/mm3, with 60% having a CD4 count >500 cells/mm3. The most common medical conditions were vaginal candidiasis, oral candidiasis, and bronchitis. Antiretroviral therapy was well accepted and followed community standards. Continuity of medical care after release was facilitated by the same physician caring for the patient in the community setting, with 83% of women following up for HIV care after release. The medical conditions noted reflect that these women are early in the course of their HIV disease when they are initially diagnosed. This comprehensive program in Rhode Island's state prison plays a central role in the diagnosis of HIV-seropositive women and provides counseling, primary medical and gynecological care, and linkage to community resources after release."
9811,0.001,1.0000,"Resistance to antiretroviral drugs remains an important limitation to successful human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) therapy. Resistance testing can improve treatment outcomes for infected individuals. The availability of new drugs from various classes, standardization of resistance assays, and the development of viral tropism tests necessitate new guidelines for resistance testing. The International AIDS Society-USA convened a panel of physicians and scientists with expertise in drug-resistant HIV-1, drug management, and patient care to review recently published data and presentations at scientific conferences and to provide updated recommendations. Whenever possible, resistance testing is recommended at the time of HIV infection diagnosis as part of the initial comprehensive patient assessment, as well as in all cases of virologic failure. Tropism testing is recommended whenever the use of chemokine receptor 5 antagonists is contemplated. As the roll out of antiretroviral therapy continues in developing countries, drug resistance monitoring for both subtype B and non-subtype B strains of HIV will become increasingly important."
4424,0.001,1.0000,"We investigated the effectiveness of the Japanese health care system for human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS), in terms of prevention, diagnosis, access to antiretroviral treatment, and treatment outcomes. Clinical information on HIV/AIDS cases was collected via questionnaires sent to 377 registered HIV/AIDS clinics in Japan. Data on 9,040 and 14,569 cases were collected in 2009 and 2014, respectively. The percentages of cases undergoing treatment were 69.6% and 87.8% in 2009 and 2014, respectively, demonstrating an improvement in treatment coverage over the 5 years between the 2 surveys. The proportion of cases with undetectable HIV RNA in the 2014 survey was 87.7%. Thus, our survey revealed that the 2 of the United Nations AIDS Fast-Track targets, 90% treated and 90% virally suppressed, are close to being achieved. However, Japan appears to have fallen short of the upstream target of 90% diagnosed. Japan needs to radically reform its strategies for encouraging people to undergo HIV testing and to develop a system for estimating the number of people living with HIV."
6071,0.001,1.0000,"Increased levels of soluble forms of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin have been found in the sera of HIV-infected patients and have been associated with disease progression. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this phenomenon reflects activation of the non-adaptive immune response in HIV infection. Fifty-one patients with HIV infection (42 men, nine women) were classified into two subgroups: those with HIV infection but without evidence of AIDS indicator conditions (HIV infected non-AIDS cases, n = 27) and those with AIDS (AIDS cases, n = 24). The activation of non-adaptive immune response was evaluated as the production of reactive oxygen species that cause lipid peroxidation, which was assessed by measuring thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS) using the thiobarbituric acid assay (TBA). Plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF), measured by rocket immunoelectrophoresis, were used to show activation of endothelial cells even in the absence of any other causative agent, in these patients. TBARS levels in non-AIDS cases were significantly higher than in control subjects (n = 17) or AIDS cases (P < 0.001). The mean vWF levels were higher in AIDS cases than in non-AIDS cases or normal subjects (P < 0.05). TBARS levels remained significantly higher in non-AIDS cases after adjusting for age, CD4 T-cell and neutrophil counts, antiretroviral therapy and vWF plasma levels. The above findings indicate that in HIV infection, the virus per se is responsible for the increased oxidative stress that in turn activates various transduction pathways, may be leading to endothelial cell activation and shedding of adhesion molecules from the cell surface."
1957,0.001,1.0000,"As the HIV epidemic threatens the social fabric of countries struggling with HIV prevalence rates as high as 10% to 30%, access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone is only the beginning of the clinical challenge. There is a need to identify adherence indicators that will ensure long-term treatment success. A cross-sectional review of 921 adult patients on ART for at least 1 year was conducted. Through an administered adherence survey, key indicators were found to be highly correlated with patient adherence. The adherence rate in this sample was 72% after being on treatment for an average of 15 months. This data suggest that having a high perceived quality of care and owning one's own home positively affected patients' adherence. Indicators such as alcohol use in the last month and a high level of depression negatively affected patients' adherence. Targeting specific indicators for specific interventions will guard against nonadherence, leading to treatment failure."

Yet, there is limited knowledge of the forces that act as barriers to health-seeking behaviors among these women. In the analysis of this focus group study of 46 women with HIV, eight distinct categories of perceived barriers to care were identified. These were: Lack of knowledge on the part of health care providers, fear of negative treatment, insensitivity of health care providers, fear by providers, lack of patient education, lack of confidentiality, lack of honesty, and blaming the victim. The women's descriptions of their experiences with health care providers are presented and discussed in the context of the potential impact of such behaviors on women's willingness to accept or continue treatment for HIV infection."
6651,0.001,1.0000,"Current interferon (IFN)-based therapies for hepatitis C in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) may be limited by incomplete virological response, lack of adherence, and poor tolerability. Newer therapies for hepatitis C will target viral replication (e.g., HCV serine protease inhibitors, helicase inhibitors, RNA interference, or an HCV polymerase inhibitor). Other treatments will focus on viral translation (e.g., antisense molecules). Additions to IFN therapy that can modulate the immune response (e.g., thymosin, isatorbine, or injectable histamine) may improve tolerability of treatment. There need to be targets that minimize the inflammatory response by the liver (e.g., IFN-gamma). There are some therapeutic vaccines in early development. Drugs to replace or enhance ribavirin are being studied with IFN-based treatments. Strategic treatment trials that address sequencing of HCV and HIV therapy with current and future therapeutic agents and combination therapy need to be undertaken."
2270,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important cause of acute hepatitis in humans worldwide, both as epidemic and sporadic disease. Since the virus was identified in 1983, epidemics have occurred regularly in many countries across South and Southeast Asia when seasonal floods have contaminated drinking water supplies and in Africa during humanitarian crises among refugee populations without access to clean water. In addition, sporadic cases and small clusters of HEV infections have been recognized throughout the world in developed countries over the past couple of decades. This review will focus on emerging evidence of HEV infection as an under-recognized pathogen in Europe, the USA and other industrialized countries. We will discuss some of the issues associated with the recognition, diagnosis and treatment of these sporadic cases. We will also summarize the recent literature on autochthonous HEV infection among populations in developed countries in industrialized Europe, the USA, Japan and other industrialized Asian countries. We will review recent reports of acute and chronic HEV infections among transplant recipients and other immunocompromised individuals including HIV/AIDS patients."
6710,0.001,1.0000,"The last international consensus conference about hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment emphasized the importance of treatment for persons coinfected with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As liver biopsy precedes treatment, we aimed to identify factors associated with the performance of liver biopsy among HIV-HCV coinfected drug users during a 5-year follow-up to study their access to HCV treatment. Of the 296 patients followed in the HIV hospital departments of Nice and Marseilles and with retrievable records about HCV diagnosis and care, 166 were eligible for analysis having had detectable HCV RNA at least once during the study period. Overall, 45.2% of patients underwent liver biopsy during follow-up. Using proportional hazard models, predictors of having had a liver biopsy were high social support, complete abstinence from drug injection, and lack of immunosuppression as well as male gender, no history of multiple incarcerations, more recent onset of drug use, and an increase of liver enzyme levels. These results suggest that specific efforts should be devoted to HIV-HCV coinfected drug users to assist with stabilizing these patients to optimize their access to HCV care whenever possible."
1511,0.001,1.0000,"With the increasing availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy, vertically infected children have a better chance of surviving into adolescence and adulthood. Additionally, sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a problem, and incidence and prevalence among youth remain high. Therefore, HIV-infected adolescents are becoming a more prominent sub-group in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Experience from the developed world indicates that providing effective care and treatment for adolescents poses unique challenges. This study aimed to identify the experiences and needs of adolescents growing up in care or on treatment for HIV in Cape Town, South Africa. Four focus groups interviews were conducted with a total of 26 young people attending an adolescent infectious diseases clinic at a tertiary hospital. Questions explored participant's perceptions on their present and future lives, and their self-identified needs. Focus groups revealed that adolescents viewed their illness negatively, but that social issues such as violence and poverty were also concerns. Despite these stressors, most respondents remained positive about the present and future, and wanted support for achieving their goals. As increasing numbers of HIV-infected children enter adolescence, healthcare providers and communities must find ways to support these young people to transition into adulthood."
6070,0.001,1.0000,"A clear understanding of the antiviral effects of CD8(+) T cells in the context of chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is critical for the development of prophylactic vaccines and therapeutics designed to support T-cell-mediated immunity. However, defining the potential correlates of effective CD8(+) T-cell immunity has proven difficult; notably, comprehensive analyses have demonstrated that the size and shape of the CD8(+) T-cell response are not necessarily indicative of efficacy determined by measures of plasma viral load. Here, we conducted a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of CD8(+) T-cell responses to autologous virus in a cohort of six HIV-infected individuals with a history of structured interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (SIT). The magnitude and breadth of the HIV-specific response did not, by themselves, explain the changes observed in plasma virus levels after the cessation of ART. Furthermore, mutational escape from targeted epitopes could not account for the differential virological outcomes in this cohort. However, the functionality of HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations upon antigen encounter, determined by the simultaneous and independent measurement of five CD8(+) T-cell functions (degranulation and gamma interferon, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-2 levels) reflected the emergent level of plasma virus, with multiple functions being elicited in those individuals with lower levels of viremia after SIT. These data show that the quality of the HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell response, rather than the quantity, is associated with the dynamics of viral replication in the absence of ART and suggest that the effects of SIT can be assessed by measuring the functional profile of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells."
4951,0.001,1.0000,"Substantial differences have been described in the response of individual patients to zidovudine (ZDV) therapy, both in the clinical impact and in virus load. Genotypic changes associated with the appearance of drug resistance may also be different or occur at different rates. We have obtained the nucleotide sequence of the RT domain of individual HIV-1 genomes extracted from 10 plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples donated by two haemophiliac patients before, during, and after long-term ZDV therapy. Although the plasma virus load was similar throughout, the order and timing of appearance of resistance-associated substitutions differed in the two patients. In patient p74, K70R appeared after 4 months, T215Y at 5.5 months, and M41L at 13 months. In p87, K70R also appeared at 4 months, but T215Y and K219Q were not observed until 18 months and M41L not at all. Much greater sequence change overall occurred in p74. The evolution of the viral population in that patient was dominated by the unique appearance of T215Y and subsequently M41L, with all sequences from the last time point being descended by a single path from the pretreatment samples. However, in p87, several different lineages of RT sequences were found to persist throughout treatment. We propose that these differences in outcome may be determined by differences in genetic background at sites other than the five generally considered to be associated with ZDV sensitivity."
5079,0.001,1.0000,"Twenty patients with chronic active hepatitis and 12 patients with chronic persistent hepatitis associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were treated with human leukocyte interferon or adenine arabinoside alone or in combination. With interferon alone, four of 16 patients showed a permanent disappearance of HBV-associated DNA polymerase (DNAP) activity from serum. Of six patients treated with adenine arabinoside alone, only one patient became permanently DNAP-negative. With a regimen of multiple cycles of combined interferon and adenine arabinoside, seven of 16 male patients became permanently DNAP-negative. Of 69 patients who met the criteria for admission to the program, spontaneous decreases in DNAP activity without treatment were observed in only 9% during a mean observation period of 10 months. In general, patients with chronic active hepatitis, those who are female, and those with a history of recent steroid therapy responded to the antiviral agents significantly better than did the other patients."

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has enabled the treatment of medical conditions in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the same way as in the general population. Moreover, improvements in supportive care have allowed HIV-infected patients with life-threatening hematological disorders to be treated with Allo-HSCT. We report on four HIV-infected patients with hematological malignancies receiving an Allo-HSCT in our institution, and on the use of donor lymphocyte infusions to successfully treat post-Allo-HSCT relapse. Of note, one of them is the first HIV(+) patient to receive a ""dual transplant"" (unrelated umbilical cord blood stem cells combined with mobilized T cell-depleted CD34(+) stem cells from a mismatched third party donor). cART drugs interactions were satisfactorily managed. This approach provided long-term control of the hematological disease. Nevertheless, despite adequate immune reconstitution, infections were the main cause of morbidity and mortality after Allo-HSCT."
3766,0.001,1.0000,"Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) after cytotoxic chemotherapy is a serious problem, and it occurred to 41% of breast cancer patients carrying HBV. Previous studies have demonstrated that lamivudine was effective for HBV flare-up during cytotoxic chemotherapy. We aimed to monitor the HBV status of breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy with preemptive lamivudine over time. Six breast cancer patients carrying hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were monitored during chemotherapy, five in the adjuvant setting and one with metastatic disease. Preemptive lamivudine was given throughout the chemotherapy course. HBsAg, HBV envelope antigen (HBeAg), anti-HBV envelope antibody (HBe Ab), serial serum alanine transaminase (ALT), quantitative HBV viral DNA analysis, and HBV DNA precore promoter and precore sequence were monitored. One patient carried wild type and the other five precore mutant strain of HBV by examination of HBV sequence in precore promoter and precore region. No evident HBV reactivation developed, and all patients tolerated lamivudine well. During the 6-to-8-month follow-up after cessation of cytotoxic therapy and withdrawal of lamivudine, serum ALT remained unchanged, although an increase of HBV DNA levels in four patients was found. No emergence of the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) lamivudine-selective resistant strain was observed in the six patients. Preemptive use of lamivudine can effectively prevent reactivation of HBV in breast cancer patients receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Lamivudine can be discontinued safely without emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV strain or rebound HBV flare-up. The candidate for the use of preemptive lamivudine in HBV carriers who need short-term chemotherapy remained to be investigated"
896,0.001,1.0000,"In February and in June 1998, two people developed acute hepatitis B following in-patient care in a district general hospital. Initial enquiries indicated their infections were not attributable to staff undertaking exposure-prone procedures (EPPs). We report the findings and implications of the subsequent investigation: a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency investigation, including molecular epidemiological analysis. Occupational Health records showed that staff involved in EPPs with the patients were HBsAg negative. No contact between the patients was identified nor were there failures in sterilization. The patients' HBV strains were identical, indicating a common source. A total of 231 out of 232 staff who might have treated either patient were tested for HBsAg; the remaining doctor, working abroad, was HBsAg- and HBeAg-positive and had the same HBV strain as the patients. On two occasions the doctor's hand had been cut while breaking glass vials, but there was no documentation linking these events to the two patients. The doctor had been vaccinated in 1993 and tested for anti-HBs prior to commencing work in 1997. The doctor was recalled to Occupational Health but did not attend and was not followed up. In total, 4948 patients potentially treated by the doctor received an explanatory letter and 3150 were tested for HBsAg. Only one was positive, and HBV sequencing showed no link to the doctor. Occasionally transmission of HBV from heath-care workers can occur in a non-EPP setting and the implications of this require examination by those setting national policy. Occupational Health Services should investigate clinical heath-care workers who do not respond to vaccination. They should ensure HBV carriers are identified and offer them appropriate advice to prevent transmission to patients."
1214,0.001,1.0000,"The living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) experience for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is still limited. Because LDLT can be performed electively, it can provide an appropriate length of time to reduce HBV DNA levels before the operation. This study aims to examine the feasibility of our protocol for preventing HBV reinfection after LDLT. Of 20 patients analyzed, 15 patients had detectable serum HBV DNA when referred to our hospital. Thirteen patients had hepatocellular carcinoma. All patients were treated with lamivudine (100 mg/d) before LDLT. After LDLT, hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) was administered to maintain serum antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen titers at greater than 1,000 IU/mL for 1 year and 200 IU/mL thereafter. Lamivudine was not administered postoperatively, except for three patients with detectable serum HBV DNA just before LDLT. All patients survived the operation. One patient died 229 days after LDLT of carcinoma recurrence. In the other 19 patients, liver function has remained normal and no viral relapse occurred postoperatively during a median follow-up of 19 months. Perioperative use of lamivudine and indefinite HBIG administration in the postoperative period might be a rational strategy for preventing HBV reinfection after LDLT."

The spectrum of renal impairment is very wide from clinically insignificant to end stage renal disease and often requires nephrologist's consultation. Therefore, we established combined renal and HIV care in the HIV Out-Patient Clinic in Warsaw. Medical records of patients consulted by nephrologist from March 2014 to March 2015 were included in analyses. Patients changing medication without consulting the physician or persistently not coming for follow-up visits were defined as non-compliant. In statistical analyses, non-parametric tests and logistic regression models were used as appropriate. In total, 100 patients were consulted by a nephrologist during the study period. All patients were white Europeans, 88 (88%) male, 42 (42%) infected through men having sex with men and 16 (16%) through intravenous drug users. Fifteen (15%) patients had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and 11 (11%) confirmed with positive HCV RNA. The most common reasons for referral were proteinuria and increased serum creatinine. In 6 out of 31 patients (19.3% of those referred for increased creatinine level) elevated serum creatinine was due to illegal substances or diet supplements use. Fifty-seven (57%) of patients were non-compliant. In univariate logistic regression models, all tested factors were non-significant. In most cases, patients were referred to nephrologist due to possible link between laboratory abnormalities and antiretroviral treatment. In one out of five cases, elevated creatinine level was linked with substance/dietary abuse. Poor compliance is an important problem in integrated nephrological care, however we were not able to identify any factors associated with non-compliance."

From June 2009 to December 2011, 150 newly diagnosed lymphoma patients with resolved HBV infection who were to receive rituximab-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone)-based chemotherapy were prospectively followed. HBV DNA was checked at baseline, at the start of each cycle of chemotherapy, and every 4 weeks for 1 year after completion of rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy. Patients with documented HBV reactivation were treated with entecavir at a dosage of 0.5 mg/day for 48 weeks. HBV reactivation was defined as a greater than 10-fold increase in HBV DNA, compared with previous nadir levels, and hepatitis flare was defined as a greater than 3-fold increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) that exceeded 100 IU/L. Incidence of HBV reactivation and HBV-related hepatitis flares was 10.4 and 6.4 per 100 person-year, respectively. Severe HBV-related hepatitis (ALT >10-fold of upper limit of normal) occurred in 4 patients, despite entecavir treatment. Patients with hepatitis flare exhibited significantly higher incidence of reappearance of HBsAg after HBV reactivation (100% vs. 28.5%; P=0.003)."

The present study was designed to investigate the differential expression patterns of ISG20 in liver biopsy samples from treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B and non-HBV infected controls and to determine the relation between the differential expression and IFN-α treatment outcome (responders vs. non-responders). HBV infection status was determined by measuring levels of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) by chemoluminescence immunoassay and of HBV DNA by real-time quantitative (q)PCR. ISG20 protein and mRNA expressions were assessed by immunohistochemistry and qPCR, respectively. Chronic hepatitis B responders showed significantly higher levels of ISG20 protein and mRNA expressions than either the chronic hepatitis B non-responders or the controls. Moreover, increased expression of ISG20 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm was correlated with positive response to IFN-α treatment. Thus, active transcription and translation of ISG20 may represent a marker to identify chronic hepatitis B patients likely to respond to IFN-α therapy. Prognostic clinical strategies based upon this marker may include genomic screening methods and immunohistochemical staining of liver biopsies."

They were tested for serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), GBV-C/HGV RNA, anti-envelope protein 2 antibody (anti-E2) and TTV DNA. Direct sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed on 58 isolates for TTV genotype determination. The prevalence of TTV DNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA, anti-E2 and over all GBV-C/HGV exposure was 24.9, 3.4, 8.2 and 11.1%, respectively. Using uni- and multi-variate analyses, male gender and TTV viremia were associated significantly with raised ALT values. Sixty-nine percent of TTV isolates were deduced to be TTV genotype 1 and they had significantly lower mean age than genotype non-1 isolates. In the population, raised ALT may be related to male gender and be attributable to TTV infection but not to GBV-C/HGV among individuals with no evidence of current HBV and HCV infection. TTV genotype 1 is the most prevalent genotype and associated with younger age."

The incidence rate in China is escalating obviously. Currently there is lack of large samples and long-term systematic observations of ocular pathological changes in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected and AIDS patients. Diagnostic errors and missed diagnosis still exist in hospitals, even in some advanced hospitals. They delay the therapy of patients, also easily result in hospital acquired infections. It is notable that there is insufficient attention to preoperative test of anti-HIV in some hospitals, especially in outpatient surgeries. Therefore potential iatrogenic infection risks are hidden. Some clinical doctors are afraid of AIDS patients, therefore they are lack of subjective initiative to comprehensively examination and treatment the patients. For the past few years, highly active antiretroviral therapy is widely used, AIDS related morbidity and mortality is significantly reduced, and the prevalence rate of ocular complications decreased from 55% to 95%. But due to the HIV/AIDS patient volume increased year by year, and the survival rate raised, prolonged survival, results in the increase of the absolute number of patients with ocular complications. Therefore it is critical to pay attention to the HIV/AIDS ocular lesions in the diagnosis and treatment of iatrogenic infection. "

Several studies have confirmed that individuals who are homozygous for a 32 base pair (bp) deletion mutation in the chemokine receptor gene CCR5, designated as delta 32/ delta 32, are protected against HIV-1 infection. Heterozygotes of the same chemokine receptor deletion mutation are, however, not protected from acquiring HIV-1 infection but seemingly have slower progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndromes (AIDS). Genotype frequencies of the delta 32 CCR5 mutation vary markedly among different ethnic groups; heterozygosity is found in approximately 15% of Caucasians, about 5-7% of Hispanics and African Americans and 1% or less of Asians. The ethnic background of Puerto Ricans is highly complex and usually includes admixture of Caucasian, Caribbean Indian and African traits to a varying extent. This study was conducted to examine the frequencies of the delta 32 CCR5 mutation among Puerto Ricans who are infected with HIV-1. Samples were received from different geographical regions of the island. Of 377 samples tested, 94.2% were wild type (non-deletion mutant) homozygotes, 5.8% were delta 32 CCR5 heterozygotes, and none were delta 32 CCR5 homozygotes. The incidence of CCR5 delta 32/w heterozygous mutation among Puerto Ricans seems to be somewhat lower than what was reported with US Hispanics. Some age and gender associated bias of the mutation frequency were observed with the study population, the reason for which is unclear at present."
1811,0.001,1.0000,"The paradox that group-specific neutralizing antibodies (NA) exist in the majority of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients, whereas the NA response against autologous HIV-1 virus isolates is highly type-specific, motivated us to study the type- and group-specific NA responses generated upon presentation of escape virus, and the viral epitopes involved in the escape. Patients with demonstrable escape virus all developed group-specific NA, which were detectable after a delay and disappeared prior to disease development. The sera tested inhibited the binding of recombinant soluble gp120IIIB to cell-associated CD4, but group-specific virus neutralization required binding of NA to HIV-1 prior to viral attachment to target cells. Consecutive escape virus isolates were tested for sensitivity to neutralization by heterologous sera. Only minor differences were demonstrated, suggesting that the majority of the change in neutralization sensitivity is driven by the selective pressure of type-specific NA. Furthermore, no differences were observed in sensitivity to neutralization by anti-carbohydrate neutralizing monoclonal antibodies or the lectin concanavalin A, indicating a conserved nature of certain carbohydrate neutralization epitopes during escape. Finally the V3 sequence of three sets of consecutive virus isolates were analysed revealing amino acid mutations in V3 sequences of all escape virus isolates. The biological significance of these variations was confirmed further by the demonstration of changes in sensitivity to neutralization by anti-V3 monoclonal antibodies. These results strongly suggest a participation of the NA response against the V3 loop in the immunoselection of escape virus."
8808,0.001,1.0000,"An effective AIDS vaccine must control highly diverse circulating strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Among HIV-1 gene products, the envelope (Env) protein contains variable as well as conserved regions. In this report, an informatic approach to the design of T-cell vaccines directed to HIV-1 Env M group global sequences was tested. Synthetic Env antigens were designed to express mosaics that maximize the inclusion of common potential T-cell epitope (PTE) 9-mers and minimize the inclusion of rare epitopes likely to elicit strain-specific responses. DNA vaccines were evaluated using intracellular cytokine staining in inbred mice with a standardized panel of highly conserved 15-mer PTE peptides. One-, two-, and three-mosaic sets that increased theoretical epitope coverage were developed. The breadth and magnitude of T-cell immunity stimulated by these vaccines were compared to those for natural strain Envs; additional comparisons were performed on mutant Envs, including gp160 or gp145 with or without V regions and gp41 deletions. Among them, the two- or three-mosaic Env sets elicited the optimal CD4 and CD8 responses. These responses were most evident in CD8 T cells; the three-mosaic set elicited responses to an average of eight peptide pools, compared to two pools for a set of three natural Envs. Synthetic mosaic HIV-1 antigens can therefore induce T-cell responses with expanded breadth and may facilitate the development of effective T-cell-based HIV-1 vaccines."
5787,0.001,1.0000,"HIV subtype-specific data on mutation type, rate, and accumulation following HAART treatment failure are limited. We studied patterns and accrual of drug resistance mutations in a Cambodian CRF01_AE-infected cohort continuing a virologically failing first-line, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor- (NNRTI-) based, HAART. Between 2005 and 2007, 837 adult HIV-infected patients had regular plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load measurements at Sihanouk Hospital Centre of Hope (SHCH), Cambodia. Drug resistance testing was performed in all patients with HIV-1 RNA >1000 copies/ml after at least 6 months of HAART. Seventy-one patients with a mean age of 34 years, of whom 68% were male, were retrospectively assessed at virological failure. The median duration of antiretroviral therapy was 12.3 (IQR 7.1-18.23) months, the median CD4 cell count was 173 (IQR 118-256) cells/mm(3), and the mean plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 3.9 log (SD 0.72) at failure. NNRTI mutations, M184I/V mutation, thymidine analogue mutations, and K65R were observed in 78.9%, 69%, 20%, and 12.7% of patients, respectively. For 33 patients, genotypic testing was carried out on at least two occasions before the switch to second-line HAART after a median duration of 5.8 (IQR 4.3-6.1) months of virological failure: 54.5% of patients accumulated new mutations with a rate of 1.6 mutations per person-year. Accumulation was seen both for nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and also in patients with low-level viremia. Subtype-specific data on mutation type, rate, and accumulation after HAART failure are urgently needed to optimize treatment strategies in resource-limited settings."

The aim of the present study was to investigate hepatitis B (HB) knowledge and vaccination acceptance among health care personnel in southwestern Greece, using the Hepatitis B Vaccine Knowledge and Acceptance Questionnaire. One hundred eighty-three employees participated (71 males). Occupation (p < .001), higher education (p < .001), and vaccination (p = .007) were significantly related to HB knowledge. The rate of HBV vaccination coverage was 70.9%. Participants considering themselves at high risk for HBV infection did not report significantly increased vaccination rates. In the multivariate analysis, university personnel (p = .002), occupational category (p < .001), and HB knowledge (p = .049) were significantly associated with vaccination. In conclusion, 29% of hospital personnel were not vaccinated mainly due to negligence. Occupation, education, and knowledge about HB seem to be associated with HBV vaccination."
3160,0.001,1.0000,"Liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has an accelerated course in the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. Some data suggest that HIV suppression achieved with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) ameliorates HCV-related liver disease progression. The aim of this study was to test if there is overexpression of serum markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients and if the effect is counteracted by HAART. In a pilot, cross-sectional, and comparative study serum markers of liver inflammation (CK-18 and HGF) and fibrosis (HGF, MMP-2, and TIMP-1) were measured via ELISA in HIV-infected patients off and on HAART, HCV monoinfected, HIV-HCV coinfected off and on HAART, and controls (10 per group). HIV-HCV-coinfected off HAART patients with low CD4 counts had higher levels of M30, HGF, and MMP-2 than HIV-HCV-coinfected on HAART. HCV coinfection predicted higher levels of MMP-2 [B 65.82 (95% CI 3.86-127.78); p = 0.04], HGF [B 520.22 (95% CI 123.65-916.78); p = 0.01] and M30 [B 128.02 (95%CI 16.39-239.64); p = 0.03]. HAART use was a predictor of lower levels of MMP2 [B -83.18 (95%CI (-146.8) - (-19.52)); p = 0.01] and M30 [B -112.9 (95% CI (-221.3) - (-4.52)); p = 0.04]. Other factors analyzed including alcohol intake ware not associated with the studied markers. In conclusion, serum markers of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis are overexpressed in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients with advanced immunosuppression, while HAART has a ""protective"" effect."
4528,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes infectious hepatitis worldwide. It is transmitted mainly by blood products and sharing of intravenous paraphernalia during illicit drug use. High prevalence rates have been described among specific groups considered to be at higher risk for HCV infection, including prison inmates. The objectives of this study were: to determine the HCV seroprevalence among inmates of Casa de Detenção de São Paulo; to identify risk factors for HCV infection; and to compare the seroprevalence of HCV to other blood borne or sexually transmitted diseases. From December, 1993, to January, 1994, a total of 779 inmates were interviewed to collect information on sociodemographic status, sexual behavior, and past experience with illicit drugs. Blood samples were obtained from 756 inmates for serological tests. 310 (41%) blood samples were positive for anti-HCV, 425 (56.2%) were negative, and 21 (2.8%) showed indeterminate results. In this population, we found a seroprevalence of 13.7% for HIV, 3.3% for syphilis (VDRL), and 68.1% for hepatitis B virus previous infection. Four variables were each identified as associated with a positive anti-HCV serologic test: a positive VDRL (OR = 2.63 IC 95% 1.08 to 6.36); a time of current imprisonment longer than 130 months (OR = 2.44 IC 95% 1.04 to 5.71); previous incarceration at Casa de Detenção de São Paulo (OR = 1.73 IC 95% 1.19 to 2.52) and; illicit drug use before admission to the Casa de Detenção de São Paulo (OR = 1.64 IC 95% 1.15 to 2.33). The seroprevalence of HCV antibodies among the study population was high (41%), indeed, one of the highest clusters of HCV infection recorded until now. Four variables were each shown to be associated with HCV infection. The simultaneous presence of these 4 variables is associated with an 82% probability of being anti-HCV positive. Although risk factor analysis indicates most HCV infections occur prior to inprisonment, initiation of control measures to prevent continued transmission after incarceration should be done."
9231,0.001,1.0000,"We previously reported a significant reduction in the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) from 2007 to 2012 in people who inject drugs (PWID; 35.9% to 18.5%, p < 0.001) and female sex workers (FSW; 23.1% to 9.8%, p < 0.05), but not in blood donors (BD) or pregnant women, in Haiphong, Vietnam. Our aim in the present study was to assess trends in the prevalence of infection with hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively). We also investigated the coinfection rates of HBV and HCV with HIV in the same groups. Between 2007 and 2012, HBV prevalence was significantly decreased in BD (18.1% vs. 9.0%, p = 0.007) and slightly decreased in FSW (11.0% vs. 3.9%, p = 0.21), but not in PWID (10.7% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.84). HCV prevalence was significantly decreased in PWID (62.1% in 2007 vs. 42.7% in 2008, p < 0.0001), but it had rebounded to 58.4% in 2012 (2008 vs. 2012, p < 0.0001). HCV prevalence also increased in FSW: 28.6% in 2007 and 2009 vs. 35.3% in 2012; however, this difference was not significant (2007 vs. 2012, p = 0.41). Rates of coinfection with HBV and HCV among HIV-infected PWID and FSW did not change significantly during the study period. Our findings suggest that the current harm reduction programs designed to prevent HIV transmission in PWID and FSW may be insufficient to prevent the transmission of hepatitis viruses, particularly HCV, in Haiphong, Vietnam. New approaches, such as the introduction of catch-up HBV vaccination to vulnerable adult populations and the introduction of HCV treatment as prevention, should be considered to reduce morbidity and mortality due to HIV and hepatitis virus coinfection in Vietnam."
8511,0.001,1.0000,"Weight loss is commonly associated with increased morbidity and mortality in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We performed a nested case-control study of 26 HIV-infected subjects recruited from a cohort of gay men enrolled in the Multicenter Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Cohort Study. To test the hypothesis that hormonal changes precede and may induce the wasting syndrome, we performed a nested case-control study and analyzed serum gonadal steroids and GH in samples of HIV-infected men with or without weight loss, uncomplicated by diarrhea or ever having an opportunistic infection. We studied 13 cases (mean age +/- SD, 45 +/- 7.2 yr) with a mean weight loss of 13 +/- 3.6%, considered to have the wasting syndrome by Centers for Disease Control criteria (weight loss of > 10%) and 13 controls matched for age and duration of follow-up. Serum bioavailable testosterone (T) levels decreased in the case group (P < 0.05) before the definition of wasting was attained, although weight loss had already begun. More impressive declines occurred in serum T (P = 0.012), free T (P = 0.0025), and bioavailable T (P < 0.0001) during the 6 months immediately before documentation of wasting. These changes were concurrent with an increase in serum FSH (P = 0.0135) without a change in serum LH. We conclude that a decline in bioavailable T occurs early in the course of events leading to wasting, suggesting that changes in gonadal hormones may contribute to the multifactorial etiology of the wasting syndrome."

All patients were men and ranged in age from 21 to 45 years. The HIV risk factors included homosexuality (6), intravenous drug abuse (2), and hemophilia A (1). All patients had high pathologically determined stage (one Stage III and seven Stage IV), and bone marrow involvement was observed in five patients with the initial diagnosis of HD based on marrow biopsy in two cases. Four cases were histologically subclassified as mixed cellularity (MC) and three as nodular sclerosis (NS); one patient underwent only bone marrow biopsy and was not subclassified. Histologically all cases were characterized by numerous Reed-Sternberg cells and variants, and with the exception of one case, all had a distinctive decrease in the proportion of reactive background lymphocytes compared with what is usually expected in MC or NS Hodgkin's disease (relative lymphocyte depletion). Flow-cytometric immunophenotypic studies done on cell suspensions from diagnostic lymph node biopsies in four cases showed decreased CD4:CD8 ratios (mean = 1.4) compared with expected values of 4 to 6. The relative lymphocyte depletion observed histologically is probably a reflection of the decreased tissue CD4:CD8 ratios, and this impairment of host immune response may be related to the observed high stage in all eight cases. Patients with high stage HD and the described histologic and immunologic features should be evaluated for the presence of HIV infection."

Eleven subjects with newly culture-proven MAC bacteremia had the following tests performed at biweekly intervals during the first 8 weeks of therapy: blood culture, Mycobacterium-specific PCR, and quantitative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral-load testing. Mycobacterium genus-specific biotinylated primers were used to amplify a sequence of approximately 582 nucleotides within the 16S rRNA genes of M. avium and M. intracellulare. Detection of the amplified product was performed with an oligonucleotide probe-coated microwell plate combined with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase-tetramethylbenzidine conjugate-substrate system. While not as sensitive as BACTEC culture, PCR detected 17 of 18 specimens which grew >/=40 organisms/ml (94.4% sensitivity) and 9 of 16 specimens which grew </=40 organisms/ml (56.3% sensitivity). No clear change in HIV viremia occurred in response to successful treatment of patients' MAC bacteremia. Use of the PCR test allowed detection of MAC bacteremia in 1 day, with a sensitivity similar to those of quantitative blood culture techniques, and it may prove useful for rapid screening of suspected cases. HIV viremia was unaffected by 8 weeks of MAC therapy."

Compared with use of no prophylaxis, use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) increased per-person lifetime costs from euro 185,600 to euro 187,900 and quality-adjusted life expectancy from 112.2 to 113.7 months, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro 18,700 per quality-adjusted life-year (euro/QALY) gained. Compared with use of TMP-SMZ alone, use of TMP-SMZ plus azithromycin cost euro 23,900/QALY gained; adding fluconazole cost an additional euro 54,500/QALY gained. All strategies that included oral ganciclovir had cost-effectiveness ratios that exceeded euro 100,000/QALY gained. In the era of HAART, on the basis of French data, prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, toxoplasmic encephalitis, and Mycobacterium avium complex bacteremia is cost-effective. Prophylaxis against fungal and cytomegalovirus infections is less cost-effective than are other therapeutic options for HIV disease and should remain of lower priority."

Common histopathological features, suggestive of HIV-1 infection but nonpathognomonic were hypercellularity (67%), myelodysplasia (86.1%), plasmacytosis (98.6%), lymphocytic infiltration (31.1%) and histiocytic infiltration with or without granulomata (13.7%). Increases in reticulin fibers (54.7%), and stainable iron deposits, vascular congestion and serous atrophy of fat were frequent features. Opportunistic infections and neoplastic complications were detected in 7 cases: pathogens were demonstrated in 4 cases (Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI), Cryptococcus neoformans, Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania) and lymphoma in 3 cases (1 Burkitt lymphoma and 2 Hodgkin's disease).

6088,0.001,1.0000,"Drug toxicity and viral resistance limit the long-term efficacy of antiviral drug treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Thus, alternative therapies need to be explored. We tested the infusion of T lymphocytes transduced with a retroviral vector (M87o) that expresses an HIV entry-inhibitory peptide (maC46). Gene-modified autologous T cells were infused into ten HIV-infected patients with advanced disease and multidrug-resistant virus during anti-retroviral combination therapy. T-cell infusions were tolerated well, with no severe side effects. A significant increase of CD4 counts was observed after infusion. At the end of the 1-year follow-up, the CD4 counts of all patients were still around or above baseline. Gene-modified cells could be detected in peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow throughout the 1-year follow-up, and marking levels correlated with the cell dose. No significant changes of viral load were observed during the first 4 months. Four of the seven patients who changed their antiviral drug regimen thereafter responded with a significant decline in plasma viral load. In conclusion, the transfer of gene-modified cells was safe, led to sustained levels of gene marking, and may improve immune competence in HIV-infected patients with advanced disease and multidrug-resistant virus."
6880,0.001,1.0000,"Relationships between some clinical data and the detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) of 37 HIV-infected persons were studied. HIV DNA was determined with the use of polymerase chain reaction. The level of HIV DNA in PMN, sufficient for determination, was mostly detected in persons with clinical manifestations of HIV infection and less frequently in asymptomatic patients (46.7% and 18.2% respectively, p < 0.05). The significant relationship between the presence of HIV DNA in NP and a decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio, as well as an increase in the level of immunoglobulins in the blood serum, has been established. The presence of HIV DNA in PMN was positively related to the decrease of the functional activity of these cells and the level of PMN in peripheral blood. The infection of PMN with HIV may be one of important mechanisms of their damage in HIV infection."

Thirteen HIV-1 patients (eight subtype B and five subtype C) that manifested T-cell autoimmunity to recombinant human CD4 (rCD4) were treated with T-cell vaccine composed of glutaraldehyde-treated autologous anti-CD4 reactive T-cells and compared to historical seven non-vaccinated HIV-1-infected subjects. This study proved to be feasible and safe. Follow-up study revealed that 7/8 subtype B and 2/4 subtype C patients (one has just received the first TCV injection) responded with a persistent increase in their blood CD4 T-cell levels and four subtype B patients manifested decreased anti-CD4 autoimmunity. Despite highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the persistence of CD4 T-cell lymphopenia may be associated with anti-CD4 autoimmunity. T-cell vaccination (TCV) may decrease such autoimmunity and elevate CD4 T-cell numbers."
9579,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and human T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infections have complex effects on adaptive immunity, with specific tropism for, but contrasting effects on, CD4 T lymphocytes: depletion with HIV-1, proliferation with HTLV-1. Impaired T lymphocyte function occurs early in HIV-1 infection but opportunistic infections (OIs) rarely occur in the absence of CD4 lymphopenia. In the unusual case where a HIV-1 infected individual with a high CD4 count presents with recurrent OIs, a clinician is faced with the possibility of a second underlying comorbidity. We present a case of pseudo-adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfection where the individual fulfilled Shimoyama criteria for chronic ATLL and had pulmonary Mycobacterium kansasii, despite a high CD4 lymphocyte count. However, there was no evidence of clonal T-cell proliferation by T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies nor of monoclonal HTLV-1 integration by high-throughput sequencing. Mutually beneficial interplay between HIV-1 and HTLV-1, maintaining high level HIV-1 and HTLV-1 viremia and proliferation of poorly functional CD4 cells despite chronicity of infection is a postulated mechanism. Despite good microbiological response to antimycobacterial therapy, the patient remained systemically unwell with refractory anemia. Subsequent initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy led to paradoxical resolution of CD4 T lymphocytosis as well as HIV-1 viral suppression and decreased HTLV-1 proviral load. This is proposed to be the result of attenuation of immune activation post-HIV virological control. This case illustrates the importance of screening for HTLV-1 in HIV-1 patients with appropriate clinical presentation and epidemiological risk factors and explores mechanisms for the complex interactions on HIV-1/HTLV-1 adaptive immunity."

Oligonucleotides composed of simple repetitive sequence motifs, including (GACA)4, (GATA)4, (GGAT)4, (GTG)5, and (GT)8, all yielded fingerprints suitable for strain segregation of 8 C. tropicalis isolates, 12 Torulopsis (Candida) glabrata isolates, 8 atypical Candida isolates, and, except for (GATA)4, 2 C. krusei probe in turn and so generate several distinct DNA fingerprints of the same DNA sample. However, none of the probes yielded fingerprints suitable for strain segregation with three C. parapsilosis isolates. The (GATA)4 probe was also used to detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms among a genetically closely related group of atypical Candida isolates on primary isolation from an additional HIV-infected patient. These chlamydospore-positive atypical Candida isolates were sucrose positive, were of C. albicans serotype A, hybridized weakly with the C. albicans-specific mid-repeat sequence probe 27A, and yielded fingerprint profiles by random polymorphic DNA analysis that were distinct from those derived from C. albicans isolates. The C. stellatoidea ex-type strain NCPF 3108 was indistinguishable from the atypical Candida isolates in all these tests and also yielded an identical carbohydrate and nitrogen source assimilation profile by using the ID 32C yeast identification system."

The prevalence of either HBV or HCV infection in 235 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was compared with that of an age- and sex-matched hospital control group of 235 patients. The prevalence of HBV infection was higher in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (15.5%) than control (8.1%), but the prevalence of HCV infection in the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients (2.1%) and control group (3%) was similar. HBV prevalence increased significantly with age in the B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. The presence of HBV proteins and DNA in lymphoma tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HBV-infected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients was also investigated using immunohistochemistry and PCR. HBV DNA was frequently detected in PBMCs from HBV-infected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients, but HBV antigens were not. Therefore, HBV infection, but not HCV infection, was associated with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Korea, suggesting a possible role for HBV in the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."
4858,0.001,1.0000,"Immune clearance of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is characterized by broad and robust antiviral T cell responses, while virus-specific T cells in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are rare and exhibit immune exhaustion that includes programmed-death-1 (PD-1) expression on virus-specific T cells. Thus, an immunotherapy able to expand and activate virus-specific T cells may have therapeutic benefit for CHB patients. Like HBV-infected patients, woodchucks infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) can have increased hepatic expression of PD-1-ligand-1 (PD-L1), increased PD-1 on CD8+ T cells, and a limited number of virus-specific T cells with substantial individual variation in these parameters. We used woodchucks infected with WHV to assess the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody therapy (αPD-L1) in a variety of WHV infection states. Experimentally-infected animals lacked PD-1 or PD-L1 upregulation compared to uninfected controls, and accordingly, αPD-L1 treatment in lab-infected animals had limited antiviral effects. In contrast, animals with naturally acquired WHV infections displayed elevated PD-1 and PD-L1. In these same animals, combination therapy with αPD-L1 and entecavir (ETV) improved control of viremia and antigenemia compared to ETV treatment alone, but with efficacy restricted to a minority of animals. Pre-treatment WHV surface antigen (sAg) level was identified as a statistically significant predictor of treatment response, while PD-1 expression on peripheral CD8+ T cells, T cell production of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) upon in vitro antigen stimulation (WHV ELISPOT), and circulating levels of liver enzymes were not. To further assess the safety of this strategy, αPD-L1 was tested in acute WHV infection to model the risk of liver damage when the extent of hepatic infection and antiviral immune responses were expected to be the greatest. No significant increase in serum markers of hepatic injury was observed over those in infected, untreated control animals. These data support a positive benefit/risk assessment for blockade of the PD-1:PD-L1 pathway in CHB patients and may help to identify patient groups most likely to benefit from treatment. Furthermore, the efficacy of αPD-L1 in only a minority of animals, as observed here, suggests that additional agents may be needed to achieve a more robust and consistent response leading to full sAg loss and durable responses through anti-sAg antibody seroconversion."

The aim of current study was to investigate the association of clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with promoter polymorphisms within the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and its major ligand, regulated upon activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) genes. Five chemokine system polymorphisms (CCR5 Delta32, CCR5 promoter 59029G/A, 59353C/T, RANTES -403G/A, and -28C/G) were studied in a total of 698 subjects. The carriage of each genetic variant was compared among ""spontaneously recovered"" group (n = 243), ""chronic carrier"" group (n = 349), and ""unexposed"" group (n = 106). CCR5 59029G promoter variant was associated with clearance of HBV infection in an acute phase (OR = 1.71, P = 0.006, dominant model; OR = 2.17, P < 0.001, recessive model) and amelioration of hepatic inflammation (P = 0.003) with the control of HBV replication (P = 0.04) in chronic carriers. Interestingly, CCR5 59029 was linked completely to CCR5 59353, and CCR5 Delta32 homozygosity or heterozygosity was not found in any Korean patient. No association was seen with RANTES polymorphisms at position -403 and -28. The CCR5 59029G/CCR5 59353T polymorphism may play a role in the clearance of HBV infection."

We have examined the joint effect of plasma 249(ser) and HBV infection in a case-control study design involving 348 control, 98 cirrhotic, and 186 HCC participants from The Gambia, West Africa, an area of high HCC incidence. The 249(ser) mutation was detected in 3.5% of controls, 15.3% of cirrhotics, and 39.8% of HCC cases (adjusted odds ratios (OR): 4.83, (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71-13.7) for cirrhosis and 20.3 (8.19-50.0) for HCC). HBsAg positivity along with plasma 249(ser) was observed in 45/183 (24.6%) HCC cases compared to only one (0.3%) control. Risk for HCC was associated with markers of HBV alone (OR: 10.0, 95% CI: 5.16-19.6), 249(ser) alone (OR: 13.2, 95% CI: 4.99-35.0), and both markers present (OR: 399, 95% CI: 48.6-3270). These results suggest a multiplicative effect on HCC risk resulting from the mutational effect of aflatoxin on TP53, as monitored by detection of plasma 249(ser), with concomitant chronic infection with HBV."
4776,0.001,1.0000,"Within the gp41 glycoprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) there is a relatively conserved region which appears accessible to the immune system during the course of HIV infection and is recognised by antibody from virtually all patients with AIDS. This region has also been shown to function as a target for human T cells. We have examined synthetic peptides spanning this sequence, between residues 572 and 604, with a view to evaluating their potential as immunogens. Peptides 572GIKQLQARILAVERYLKDQQ591 and 579RILAVERYLKDQQLLGGIWGCSGK601 were good immunogens in two different strains of mice while peptide 576LQARILAVERYLKDQQ591 was an inferior immunogen, and peptide 593LGIWGCSGKLIC604 was non-immunogenic unless coupled to a carrier protein. For both antibody and T cell responses it was apparent that sequences that could function as determinants within one peptide could not do so in the context of a different peptide immunogen. It follows that by judicious choice of immunogen sequence it may be possible to direct the immune response towards a desired fine specificity. Unwanted responses by CD4+ T cells isolated from certain peptide-primed animals were also observed. These T cells showed an unusual reactivity in that they were incapable of recognising their determinant AVERYLKDQQ if it was extended at the C-terminal end with the native sequence and as such would not be expected to recognise the native molecule unless processing created the identical C-terminus."
4007,0.001,1.0000,"The specific cellular immune response toward envelope and core proteins of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) was investigated in gibbon apes chronically infected with the HTLV-IIIB isolate. After in vitro stimulation of PBMC from infected and control animals with HIV-1 Ag, DNA synthesis, IL-2R expression and IL-2 release were assayed. Cells from infected gibbon apes demonstrated a group-specific response toward whole virus preparations from three divergent HIV-1 isolates (HTLV-IIIB, HTLV-IIIRF, HTLV-IIIMN). Consistent responses were also detected against purified HIV-1 Ag, i.e., native gp120 envelope glycoprotein, recombinant gp160 glycoprotein, a synthetic peptide (peptide 7) representing a highly conserved region of gp120, and purified native core protein p24. In addition, lymphocytes from infected gibbon apes displayed a specific, MHC-restricted, cytotoxic activity against autologous cells expressing HIV-1 envelope or gag proteins. The specific T cell reactivity toward HIV-1 proteins observed in infected gibbons contrasts with findings in HIV-1 infected humans, and may help to explain the apparent discrepancy in the natural history of the infection between the two species."
4570,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-associated dementia (HAD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by HIV infection and replication in brain tissue. HIV-1-infected monocytes overexpress inflammatory molecules that facilitate their entry into the brain. Prostanoids are lipid mediators of inflammation that result from cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity. Because COX-2 is normally induced during inflammatory processes, the aim of this study was to investigate whether COX-2 expression is up-regulated during monocyte-brain endothelium interactions. In vitro cocultures of HIV-infected macrophages and brain endothelium showed an up-regulation of COX-2 expression by both cell types. This up-regulation occurs via an interleukin-1beta (IL1beta)-dependent mechanism in macrophages and via an IL-1beta-independent mechanism in endothelial cells. Thus, interactions between HIV-infected monocytes and brain endothelium result in COX-2 expression and, as such, might contribute to the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection."
6513,0.001,1.0000,"We report a patient with antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) but no antibodies to other hepatitis B virus components, who developed acute symptomatic type B hepatitis. The possible explanations for this unusual serological pattern are 1) the antibody-positive status, which developed against only a subdeterminant of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), arose naturally or as the result of cross-reaction with a variety of antigens; and 2) seroconversion to anti-HBs occurred in response to surface antigen of a mutant strain of hepatitis B virus (HBV). This anti-HBs positivity, in the absence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, does not provide natural immunization against HBV infection, and so is not protective. Individuals who are positive to anti-HBs antibody alone which is not elicited by HBV vaccine, should be vaccinated against possible HBV infection."
5258,0.001,1.0000,"Recent studies suggest that human endogenous retrovirus group K (HERV-K) provirus expression plays a role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. In particular, RNA from the HML-2 subgroup of HERV-K proviruses has been reported to be highly expressed at the cellular level and detectable in the plasma of HIV-1-infected patients, suggestive of virion production and, perhaps, replication. In this study, we developed an HML-2-specific quantitative-PCR assay that detects 51 of the 89 known HML-2 proviruses in the human genome. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV-negative controls and HIV-1-infected patients were collected for analysis of HML-2 RNA expression. Contrary to previous reports, we did not detect high levels of HML-2 RNA in the plasma of HIV-1-infected patients, but we did observe a significant increase of HML-2 RNA in total PBMCs compared to HIV-negative controls. The level of HML-2 expression in PBMCs does not appear to be related to patient use of antiretrovirals or to HIV-1 plasma RNA, cellular RNA, or cellular DNA levels. To investigate the source of HML-2 RNA expression, patient PBMCs were sorted into CD3+ CD4+, CD3+ CD8+, CD3- CD14+, and CD3- CD20+ cell subsets and then analyzed for HML-2 RNA levels. No single cell subset was enriched for HML-2 RNA expression in HIV-1-infected patients, but there appears to be substantial variability in the level of HML-2 expression depending on the cell type."
4641,0.001,1.0000,"Tat activation-response region (TAR) decoys have been developed for use in gene therapy for people infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). When a TAR RNA decoy is overexpressed, it will bind Tat, thus leaving less of this crucial protein to bind to and activate the natural transcriptional promoter of HIV-1. Previous TAR decoy constructs have used HIV-1 TAR. However, recent epidemiological and biological data began to suggest that the TAR region from the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) may suppress HIV-1 transcription and hence replication. We created a vector which overexpresses TAR-2 under the control of the human U6 small nuclear RNA gene promoter and here show that the U6-TAR-2 decoy construct potently inhibits both HIV-2 and HIV-1 gene expression. Further, this decoy construct is able to markedly suppress HIV-1 replication. Thus, we have directly proven that TAR-2 can suppress HIV-1 replication and suggest that the HIV-2 TAR decoy may prove useful for combating HIV-1 infection."
3297,0.001,1.0000,"RT-SHIV is a chimera of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) containing the reverse transcriptase (RT)-encoding region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) within the backbone of SIVmac239. It has been used in a non-human primate model for studies of non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTI) and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We and others have identified several mutations that arise in the ""foreign"" HIV-1 RT of RT-SHIV during in vivo replication. In this study we catalogued amino acid substitutions in the HIV-1 RT and in regions of the SIV backbone with which RT interacts that emerged 30 weeks post-infection from seven RT-SHIV-infected rhesus macaques. The virus set points varied from relatively high virus load, moderate virus load, to undetectable virus load. The G196R substitution in RT was detected from 6 of 7 animals at week 4 post-infection and remained in virus from 4 of 6 animals at week 30. Virus from four high virus load animals showed several common mutations within RT, including L74V or V75L, G196R, L214F, and K275R. The foreign RT from high virus load isolates exhibited as much variation as that of the highly variable envelope surface glycoprotein, and 10-fold higher than that of the native RT of SIVmac239. Isolates from moderate virus load animals showed much less variation in the foreign RT than the high virus load isolates. No variation was found in SIVmac239 genes known to interact with RT. Our results demonstrate substantial adaptation of the foreign HIV-1 RT in RT-SHIV-infected macaques, which most likely reflects selective pressure upon the foreign RT to attain optimal activity within the context of the chimeric RT-SHIV and the rhesus macaque host.

5584,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C recurrence is the main cause of graft loss in liver transplant patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HII). These patients have higher risk of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, which is the most severe type of hepatitis C recurrence. Until direct antiviral agents were released, only a minority of patients could be satisfactorily treated. We describe the successful treatment with pegylated-interferon, ribavirin and telaprevir of an hepatitis C virus (HCV)/HIV co-infected patient who developed fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis after liver transplantation. A 40-year- old male (HCV genotype 1a; IL-28 CC) underwent liver transplantation for decompensated cirrhosis. On post-transplant day 60, he rapidly developed progressive jaundice, worsening of liver function tests and ascites. A transjugular liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Treatment with peglated-interferon, ribavirin and telaprevir was indicated for 48 weeks, achieving sustained virological response at 12 weeks of follow-up. The rapid negativization of the viral load observed during the first 4 weeks of treatment was associated with regression of ascites andjaundice. Red blood cell transfusions, erythropoietin and filgrastim were required for the management of anemia and neutropenia. Triple therapy with telaprevir might be indicated for the treatment of severe HCV recurrence in selected HCV/HIV co-infected patients, especially in countries with limited access to pegylated-interferon-free regimens."
9673,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the central nervous system (CNS) is characterized by replication in macrophages or brain microglia that express low levels of the CD4 receptor and is the cause of HIV-associated dementia and related cognitive and motor disorders that affect 20 to 30% of treatment-naive patients with AIDS. Independent viral envelope evolution in the brain has been reported, with the need for robust replication in resident CD4(low) cells, as well as CD4-negative cells, such as astrocytes, proposed as a major selective pressure. We previously reported giant-cell encephalitis in subtype B and C R5 simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected macaques (SHIV-induced encephalitis [SHIVE]) that experienced very high chronic viral loads and progressed rapidly to AIDS, with varying degrees of macrophage or microglia infection and activation of these immune cells, as well as astrocytes, in the CNS. In this study, we characterized envelopes (Env) amplified from the brains of subtype B and C R5 SHIVE macaques. We obtained data in support of an association between severe neuropathological changes, robust macrophage and microglia infection, and evolution to CD4 independence. Moreover, the degree of Env CD4 independence appeared to correlate with the extent of astrocyte infection in vivo. These findings further our knowledge of the CNS viral population phenotypes that are associated with the severity of HIV/SHIV-induced neurological injury and improve our understanding of the mechanism of HIV-1 cellular tropism and persistence in the brain."
2529,0.001,1.0000,"Although newer and more effective treatments are now available for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, non-HCV viral hepatitis remains an important cause of liver disease, especially among HIV-infected individuals. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of cirrhosis worldwide, and approximately one-quarter of patients with cirrhosis develop decompensated liver disease within 5 years. Initial treatment for chronic HBV infection includes peginterferon alfa, entecavir, and tenofovir. Approximately 15 million of the estimated 350 million individuals with chronic HBV infection have evidence of exposure to hepatitis D (delta) virus (HDV), which requires hepatitis B surface antigen for transmission and packaging. HBV/HDV coinfection is associated with more severe acute hepatitis and higher mortality than acute HBV monoinfection. Chronic coinfection is associated with a higher risk of cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease. The mainstay of treatment for HDV infection is peginterferon alfa for at least 48 weeks. Cases of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in HIV-infected persons have been reported. HEV infection can become chronic in immunosuppressed patients, and chronic infection is associated with rapid development of cirrhosis. There are no established guidelines for treating HEV infection in HIV-infected persons. This article summarizes a presentation by Jennifer Price, MD, at the IAS-USA continuing education program held in San Francisco, California, in June 2013. "
2318,0.001,1.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI) is defined as the presence of HBV DNA in the liver (with or without detectable HBV DNA in serum) for individuals testing HBV surface antigen negative. Until recently, the clinical effect of OBI was unclear on the progression of liver disease; on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma; and on the risk for reactivation or transmission of HBV infection. Several studies suggest a high prevalence of OBI among patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease, but its role in the progression to cirrhosis remains unclear. Although OBI has been well documented in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, especially among those coinfected with hepatitis C virus, further studies are needed to determine its current clinical impact in HIV setting."
119,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in HIV-positive individuals. Although HBV vaccination is mandatory for HIV-positive individuals with negative-HBV markers, lower rates of protection are achieved. HIV infection accelerates the course of liver disease caused by chronic HBV infection, leading to end-stage hepatic illness and increasing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Anti-HBV active agents, especially tenofovir, improve outcomes. Lamivudine alone should be limited to patients with low serum HBV-DNA levels, since selection of drug resistance often compromises long-term benefits, leads to cross-resistance with other antivirals, and favors the potential emergence of HBV-vaccine escape mutants.

8426,0.001,1.0000,"Several studies have examined the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a trauma population. To our knowledge, no one has reported on the prevalence of hepatitis C (HCV). We prospectively studied the prevalence of HCV, as well as HBV, HIV, and syphilis in our adult regional level I trauma center population. Two hundred eighty-six consecutive trauma patients were tested for previous exposure to HCV using an anti-HCV mAb ELISA. Patients were also tested for exposure to HBV, HIV, and syphilis, and for illicit drug use. All rho values were calculated using Yates' corrected chi 2 or Student's t test. Twenty-two patients (7.7%) were found to have anti-HCV antibodies, five patients (1.7%) had active HBV, nine patients (3.2%) had HIV, and 16 patients (6%) were positive by RPR. Four (18%) of the patients seropositive for HCV tested positive for HBV, HIV, or syphilis as well. The HIV-positive patients were more likely than the HIV-negative patients to be HCV positive (rho = 0.018). Nine of the HCV seropositive patients (41%) tested positive for cocaine use. Cocaine users were more likely than nonusers to be HCV positive (rho = 0.0007). We have demonstrated the prevalence of HCV in our trauma population to be high (7.7%). It is well known that HCV has a high rate of chronicity, thus up to 90% of these patients are carriers and represent a substantial risk to health care workers. The two significant risk factors, HIV status and cocaine use, are difficult to elicit in the acute setting, reinforcing the need for adhering to universal precautions."
6380,0.001,1.0000,"In Italy, about 7 % of the resident population is represented by immigrants originating from geographic regions at high endemicity for hepatitis B virus infection. This study aims to assess the prevalence of occult HBV infection (OBI) including the identification of HBV-genotypes in a population of immigrants serologically negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Between May 2006 and May 2010, 339 immigrants were tested for markers of HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. HBV-DNA was tested by using nested-PCR assays on three different genetic region. HBV-DNA was detected in plasma samples of 11/339 (3.2 %) patients. Most of them had no serological markers of HBV infection, 3/58 (5.2 %) were anti-HBc-alone, and 4/13 (30.8 %) were anti-HIV positive. HIV positivity was the only factor independently associated with the higher probability of observing OBI (OR = 16.5, p < 0.001). No HCV co-infected patients were found. Genotype D was detected in 9/11 (81.8 %) OBI cases, while the remaining two (18.2 %) were classified as genotype E. Although OBI was found at lower rate than expected among immigrants from highly endemic countries, anti-HBc alone positivity was confirmed as a sentinel marker of occult HBV infection. Nevertheless, a marked heterogeneity of HBV markers was found among HBV-DNA positive subjects. Our finding evidenced the predominance of HBV-genotype D viral strains among OBI cases, also in those from geographical areas where overt HBV infections are mainly sustained by viral genotypes other than D.

4173,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1 group O infections remains essentially restricted to central Africa, and particularly Cameroon, although isolated cases have been reported in Western countries. Genomic differences explain why commercial tests used to quantify HIV-1 group M plasma load are unsuitable for HIV-1 group O. This lack of a quantitative tool hinders the clinical management of HIV-O-infected patients. We have therefore developed a real-time PCR assay, based on LightCycler technology, to quantify HIV-1 group O RNA in plasma. The primers were selected in the LTR 3' region. Forty-eight plasma samples containing strains belonging to the different HIV-1 type O clades (O:A, O:B and O:C) were tested. RNA was quantifiable in 40 of these samples. RNA was always detected in samples from untreated patients, except for one patient infected by a highly divergent strain. The kinetics of plasma viral load were also examined in seven patients for whom clinical and immunologic follow-up data were available. HIV-1 group O plasma load was high in the absence of treatment and correlated negatively with the CD4 cell count. Serial samples obtained during treatment allowed us to compare viral load changes with immunologic outcome. Despite the high initial cost of acquiring the required cycling device, the per-sample cost of this real-time quantitative PCR assay for HIV-1 group O is low, making it suitable for use in endemic zones."
6065,0.001,1.0000,"Blood transfusion is an important mode of transmission of infections to the recipient. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections and the possible risk factors among blood donors. During the study period (1994-99) donor samples were screened for HBsAg, HIV, HCV and Syphilis. The relevant donor history was examined to identify the risk factors leading to transfusion transmissible infections. The prevalence of infection was 3.1% among donors, with HBsAg constituting 1.3%, HCV 1.4%, HIV 0.2% and RPR 0.2%. In a classification based on occupation, class III donors (drivers, Businessmen & men in uniform) showed a significantly higher incidence of transfusion transmissible infections for HIV (0.38%) and Syphilis (0.36%). Health care workers constituted only a small fraction of the study; prevalence of infections was low among them. History of jaundice or hospitalization was not associated with higher incidence of seropositivity. Seropositivity for HIV is relatively low compared to similar studies conducted in other regions of the country. This finding is attributed to the pre donation counseling in donor selection. An important outcome of the study is that Class III donors form a high-risk group for transfusion transmissible infections."

All patients received antiretroviral therapy with standard doses of lamivudine, stavudine and efavirenz or lopinavir/retonavir. All three were diagnosed with Mycobacterium tuberculosis on one or more occasions: pulmonary or miliary involvement or tuberculous meningitis. One patient developed spinal paraplegia and needed an urgent laminectomy. Later he recovered almost completely. The interaction between antiretroviral and antituberculosis treatments combined with chemotherapy, antibiotics and supportive care is not known. Despite the severity and the complexity of several associated diseases, the outcome of the patients was rewarding and encouraging."
5114,0.001,1.0000,"A wide range of pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, Mycobacterium, Leishmania, and Helicobacter pylori, can interact with dendritic cell (DC)-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), expressed on DCs and a subset of B cells. More specifically, the interaction of the gp120 envelope protein of HIV-1 with DC-SIGN can facilitate the transfer of virus to CD4+ T lymphocytes in trans and enhance infection. We have previously demonstrated that a multimeric LeX component in human milk binds to DC-SIGN, preventing HIV-1 from interacting with this receptor. Biochemical analysis reveals that the compound is heat resistant, trypsin sensitive, and larger than 100 kDa, indicating a specific glycoprotein as the inhibitory compound. By testing human milk from three different mothers, we found the levels of DC-SIGN binding and viral inhibition to vary between samples. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization analysis, we identified bile salt-stimulated lipase (BSSL), a Lewis X (LeX)-containing glycoprotein found in human milk, to be the major variant protein between the samples. BSSL isolated from human milk bound to DC-SIGN and inhibited the transfer of HIV-1 to CD4+ T lymphocytes. Two BSSL isoforms isolated from the same human milk sample showed differences in DC-SIGN binding, illustrating that alterations in the BSSL forms explain the differences observed. These results indicate that variations in BSSL lead to alterations in LeX expression by the protein, which subsequently alters the DC-SIGN binding capacity and the inhibitory effect on HIV-1 transfer. Identifying the specific molecular interaction between the different forms may aid in the future design of antimicrobial agents."

The analysis was performed from a health care perspective and compared azithromycin (1200 mg/week) with no prophylaxis over a period of 10 years based on data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and randomized controlled trials. The main outcome measures were: expected survival; average health care costs; and cost-effectiveness in 1997 Swiss francs ( pound1 corresponds to about 2.3 CHF) per life-year saved. In patients with an initial CD4 count <50 cells/mm(3) and no AIDS, azithromycin increased expected survival by 4 months. In patients with AIDS, HAART durability had a major impact on expected survival and costs. Incremental survival increased from 2 to 4 months if we assumed a 10 year, instead of a 3 year, HAART effect. The cost-effectiveness of azithromycin relative to no prophylaxis in patients without AIDS was between 47,000 CHF (3-year HAART effect) and 60,000 CHF (10-year HAART effect) per life-year saved. The cost-effectiveness ratio increased to 118,000 CHF per life-year saved in patients with symptomatic AIDS. In conclusion, in the era of HAART, MAC prophylaxis with azithromycin increases expected survival and reduces health care costs substantially. Starting MAC prophylaxis in patients without AIDS is more effective and cost-effective than in patients with AIDS."

At diagnosis, just prior to starting combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), AHI participants completed assessments of depression and anxiety symptoms that were repeated at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Blood markers of HIV infection and immune activation were measured at study entry, with optional cerebrospinal fluid measures. A high frequency of participants reported symptoms that exceeded published thresholds supportive of depression (55.0%) and anxiety (65.8%) at diagnosis, with significant reductions after starting cART. Meeting a threshold for clinically relevant depressive symptoms at study entry was associated with higher baseline plasma HIV RNA (5.98 vs. 5.50, t = 2.46, p = 0.015), lower CD4 counts (328 vs. 436 cells/mm"

We also aimed to compare the sensitivity of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear tests for patients with HIV using sputum cultures as the gold standard. A cross-section study was conducted among adult patients (> or = 18 years old) with prolonged cough (greater than two weeks), night sweats, fever, and/or weight loss suspected of pulmonary TB between February and March 2006. Sputum samples were obtained and processed for 165 patients; 53 (32.1%) were culture positive for TB. Patients with TB were predominantly male (92.1%), young (median age of 32 years), and the HIV-seroprevalence was high (41.5%). In the multivariable analysis adjusted for age, HIV infection was significantly associated (POR = 2.0, p < 0.05) with the presence of TB disease. Among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates recovered from 53 cases, 25 (47.2%) were resistant to > or = 1 first line anti-TB drugs and 7 (13.2%) were MDR-TB. The sensitivity of AFB smears among HIV negative and positive participants was 35.5% and 18.0%, respectively. Our findings demonstrated that the sensitivity of AFB smears to detect TB among HIV positive patients was low. Additionally, we found that even in regions where population drug resistance estimates are low, sentinel surveillance of MDR-TB in high-risk populations is useful to prioritize target groups in need of additional prevention, monitoring and health outreach."
9575,0.001,1.0000,"Recurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. Recently, antiviral therapy, such as lamivudine, has become available for prophylaxis against HBV reactivation posttransplantation and for the treatment of HBV recurrent disease. We report our initial experience with lamivudine therapy in patients with precore mutant-associated HBV infection undergoing liver transplantation (n = 29). Outcomes were compared in three patient groups: group 1, precore mutant HBV infection not receiving lamivudine (n = 10); group 2, recurrent precore mutant HBV infection posttransplantation subsequently treated with lamivudine (n = 10); and group 3, HBV precore mutant patients undergoing liver transplantation and receiving lamivudine and low-dose hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) from the time of transplantation (n = 9). In group 1, HBV recurred in 9 of 10 patients, with subsequent graft loss in all 9 patients. In group 2, all patients developed HBV recurrence at a mean of 7.3 months posttransplantation and started lamivudine therapy at a median of 16 months posttransplantation. Follow-up on lamivudine therapy was for a median of 11 months. Six of these 10 patients developed mutations in the HBV polymerase gene associated with lamivudine resistance. There were two liver failure-related deaths in this group. In group 3 patients, there was one death from graft-versus-host disease. The remaining 8 patients have been followed up for a mean of 15.6 months posttransplantation, and all remain hepatitis B surface antigen negative and HBV DNA negative. In conclusion, lamivudine therapy in association with low-dose HBIG is effective in preventing HBV reactivation posttransplantation. Rescue therapy with lamivudine in patients with HBV recurrence is only moderately effective, with a 60% lamivudine resistance rate in patients treated for longer than 6 months."
9347,0.001,1.0000,"Type and prevalence of zidovudine (ZDV) resistance mutations in HIV-1-infected children in clinically stable condition and on ZDV monotherapy were analyzed to evaluate the effect of switching to didanosine (ddI) monotherapy or to ZDV plus ddI on the pattern of mutations and on the clinical outcome. Monthly clinical and laboratory controls for HIV-1 infection status were performed; at enrollment and every 4 to 6 months after treatment randomization mutant proviral sequences were evaluated in all the children, whereas viral burden was performed only in a small subgroup of patients randomly selected in each of the three treatment groups. ZDV resistance-associated proviral DNA mutations were defined as low-level resistance (LLR) mutations or medium/high-level resistance (MHLR) mutations; clinical outcome was considered as stable or deteriorating. Results showed that at entry into the study the duration of ZDV therapy was significantly correlated with the presence of mutations, and that the level of resistance given by mutations was associated with the severity both of symptoms and immunodeficiency. After randomization to treatment, in patients with mutations that confer LLR a better clinical outcome with ddI monotherapy than with ZDV plus ddI and ZDV alone was observed in the subsequent 6 months, whereas in patients with mutations that confer MHLR no significant difference among the three treatment groups was found. Data showed also that levels of viral burden at the time of changing therapy are related to clinical outcome if measured by plasma viral load. These results suggest that genotypic resistance assays, together with viral load, may prove useful for rational treatment decisions both at the start of therapy and with failure."
1038,0.001,1.0000,"The life cycle of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is closely related to host lipoprotein metabolism. Serum levels of lipid are associated with the response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) therapy, while single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around the human interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene locus and amino acid substitutions in the core region of the HCV have been reported to affect the efficacy of PEG-IFN/RBV therapy in chronic hepatitis with HCV genotype 1b infection. The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between serum lipid and factors that are able to predict the efficacy of PEG-IFN/RB therapy, with specific focus on apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) in 148 subjects with chronic HCV G1b infection. Our results demonstrated that both the aa 70 substitution in the core region of the HCV and the rs8099917 SNP located proximal to the IL28B were independent factors in determining serum apoB-100 and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. A significant association was noted between higher levels of apoB-100 (P = 1.1 × 10(-3)) and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.02) and the subjects having Arg70. A significant association was also observed between subjects carrying the rs8099917 TT responder genotype and higher levels of apoB-100 (P = 6.4 × 10(-3)) and LDL cholesterol (P = 4.2 × 10(-3)). Our results suggest that apoB-100 and LDL cholesterol are markers of impaired cellular lipoprotein pathways and/or host endogenous interferon response to HCV in chronic HCV infection. In particular, serum apoB-100 concentration might be an informative marker for judging changes in HCV-associated intracellular lipoprotein metabolism in patients carrying the rs8099917 responder genotype."
9340,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is classified into eight major genotypes, A-H, which are geographically distributed worldwide. The aim of this work was to describe the clinical characteristics associated with the HBV genotypes circulating in Buenos Aires city. The study included 139 patients infected with HBV, whose clinical courses were classified as acute symptomatic self-limiting hepatitis, inactive carrier state and chronic active hepatitis (HBV e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative). The HBV genotypes were determined in 128 patients by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and phylogenetic analysis. Biochemical, virological, clinical and histological features were analysed. A differential distribution of genotypes between acute symptomatic and chronic infections was found. Among the acute cases, genotype F was predominant (65.2%, 30/46) and genotype D was rare (4.3%, 2/46), whereas among the chronic infections, a homogeneous distribution of genotypes A (26.8%, 22/82), D (31.7%, 26/82) and F (36.6%, 30/82), with an unusual presence of genotypes B (1.2%, 1/82) and C (3.7%, 3/82), was observed. Regarding the liver histology of chronically infected patients, genotype F tended to display higher histological activity indexes. Mutations related to HBV surface antigen immunoreactivity, antiviral resistance and HBeAg-negative status were studied. This work constitutes, to our knowledge, the first description of the clinical characteristics related to HBV genotypes in Argentina, where the distribution of genotypes in patients with acute infection has not been reported previously. Finally, it was established that genotype F is the prevalent genotype among the acute symptomatic infections in Buenos Aires city, and that it shows a tendency to cause an adverse disease outcome among the chronic cases."
7836,0.001,1.0000,"Long-term non-progressors (LTNP) represent a minority (1-5%) of HIV-infected individuals characterized by documented infection for more than 7-10 years, a stable CD4+ T cell count over 500/mm(3) and low viremia in the absence of antiretroviral treatment. Protective factors described so far such as the CCR5delta32 deletion, protective HLA alleles, or defective viruses fail to fully explain the partial protection phenotype. The existence of additional host resistance mechanisms in LTNP patients was investigated here using a whole human genome microarray study comparing gene expression profiles of unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from LTNP patients, HIV-1 infected patients under antiretroviral therapy with CD4+ T cell levels above 500/mm(3) (ST), as well as healthy individuals. Genes that were up- or downregulated exclusively in LTNP, ST or in both groups in comparison to controls were identified and classified in functional categories using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. ST and LTNP patient groups revealed distinct genetic profiles, regarding gene number in each category and up- or downregulation of specific genes, which could have a bearing on the outcome of each group. We selected some relevant genes to validate the differential expression using quantitative real-time qRT-PCR. Among others, we found several genes related to the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Our results identify new possible host genes and molecules that could be involved in the mechanisms leading to the slower progression to AIDS and sustained CD4+ T cell counts that is peculiar to LTNP patients.

3017,0.001,1.0000,"The CNS is frequently involved in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In recent studies using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, investigators found a significant reduction in N-acetyl aspartate, a metabolic marker of neurons, in late stages of dementia. To further understand the relationship between proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy changes and clinical disease and dementia, we compared 20 HIV-infected patients presenting at varying stages of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex and infection to 10 age-matched controls. We found a significant reduction in N-acetyl aspartate/creatine only in patients who had advanced dementia and CD4 counts less that 200/microliter. By contrast, a significant elevation in compounds containing choline was present in patients in the early stages of HIV infection of who had CD4 counts greater than 200/microliter, in patients with normal MRI scans, and in all AIDS dementia complex groups, including subjects with no or minimal cognitive impairment. An elevated choline level also occurred in later stages of HIV infection (CD4 < 200/microliter). Our results suggest that an increase in choline occurs before N-acetyl aspartate decrements, MRI abnormalities, and the onset of dementia, and may therefore provide a useful marker for early detection of brain injury associated with HIV infection."
5135,0.001,1.0000,"As the lifespan of patients with HIV continues to increase secondary to improvements in antiretroviral medications, patients can keep the virus in a latent state for a longer period of time than ever before. As a result, patients live longer with infection and demand a higher quality of life during the course of the disease. The most important decision in the management of otologic manifestations of AIDS is whether the patient should be operated. The surgery of HIV-infected patients includes two important issues: Risk of transmission of HIV to health care workers and delay of wound healing. In this paper we describe the three otologic procedures of two HIV-infected patients managed successfully without complication. We, like many others, believe that otolaryngologists should apply strict surgical criteria to HIV-infected patients for otologic procedures and should not withhold rational therapy because of the patient's HIV status."

The viruses could be serially subcultured in umbilical cord PBL cultures in which they infected helper (CD4) T-lymphocytes producing multinucleate giant cells with intranuclear inclusions followed by cell lysis. Electron microscopy of infected cultures revealed that the isolates were herpesviruses. Specific DNA probing showed that the 4 isolates were related to one another but were distinct from cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Herpesvirus hominis types 1 and 2, and varicella-zoster virus. HTLHV lyses the same target cell as human immunodeficiency virus in PBL cultures suggesting that it may have a similar potential to cause acquired immune deficiency. The development of an unequivocally diagnostic serological test is a priority, so that the epidemiology and pathogenesis of HTLHV infection can be studied."

The treatment effect did not vary significantly in patient subgroups of different CD4 cell counts, hemoglobin levels, age, race, and sex, and with or without AIDS diagnosis. Acyclovir treatment (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.93), higher CD4 cell count (P < .001), higher hemoglobin level (P < .001), and younger age (P < .001) reduced the hazard of mortality. Acyclovir decreased herpes simplex virus infections (odds ratio [OR], 0.28; 95% CI, 0.21-0.37) and varicella-zoster virus infections (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.13-0.63) but not cytomegalovirus disease or mortality from lymphoma or Kaposi's sarcoma. A survival advantage was seen specifically in studies with high incidence of clinical herpesvirus infections (> or = 25% per year). Given the wide confidence intervals, the small effect in low-risk patients, and recent changes in HIV therapeutics, the results should be interpreted cautiously, but the meta-analysis supports the importance of pathogenetic interactions between herpesviruses and HIV."
2430,0.001,1.0000,"As thymocyte infection may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for CD4+ T lymphocyte depletion in HIV-1-infected individuals, we studied the occurrence of HIV-1 infection in the thymus in vivo. Thymus (THYPD) and peripheral blood (PBLPD) primary viral isolates were obtained from an HIV-1-infected patient; restriction pattern analysis revealed the presence of a viral variant (THY) in the thymus isolate, from which biological viral clones containing this variant were obtained by limiting dilution infection of Molt-3 cells. The biological phenotype of the viral isolates and THY clones was studied in different cell lines and primary cultures. PBLPD, THYPD, and THY clones could efficiently infect T cell lines; the thymic variant showed a higher cytopathic activity in T cell lines, and a higher replication capacity in both unfractionated and CD4+CD8(+)-enriched primary thymocytes. Sequence analysis of the viral population patterns in vivo confirmed the presence of the THY variant in the thymic compartment, and revealed that the degree of V3 loop heterogeneity was higher in the thymocytes of the patient than in the peripheral blood lymphocytes. In addition to confirming thymocyte infection in vivo, our data also indicate that a differential distribution of viral variants may occur among different body compartments in a single individual; the emergence of cytopathic and tissue-specific variants in the thymus may play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease."

Infection with this virus has epidemiologic characteristics similar to hepatitis B, with infection from contaminated blood appearing to be a primary source of disease. Although 80% to 90% of the viral hepatitis associated with blood transfusions used to be the most common mechanism for HCV transmission, parenteral drug abuse has become the major documented risk factor in the United States. Health care workers face occupational hazards for HCV infection primarily through needlestick and other contaminated sharps accidents, although the risks are much lower than those historically documented for HBV. Current universal bloodborne precautions for infection control appear to be effective against occupational cross-infection in patient care settings. Ongoing studies in patients with long-term persistent hepatitis C are investigating the usefulness of prolonged interferon therapy to reduce hepatic damage and HCV chronicity."

We treated 7 patients with diagnosed AIDS who did not respond to eight or more antiretroviral therapies in an open label pilot study with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), ABC, ddI, amprenavir (APV), and ritonavir (RTV), with or without efavirenz (EFV). Therapy was well tolerated despite the patients' advanced disease states. No significant decline in lymphocyte or other blood counts was observed. Median HIV RNA was 5.26 log10 copies/ml at entry, 4.53 log10 copies/ml at 4 weeks, and 5.13 log10 copies/ml at 16 weeks. Median CD4+ count was 34 cells/microl at entry and 39 cells/microl at 16 weeks of therapy. CD4+ counts increased further in five study subjects on extended therapy to 25 weeks (median 27 cells/microl at entry, 66 cells/microl at close), despite loss of virologic suppression in 4 of 5 cases. MPA can induce apoptosis in lymphocytes in vitro. However despite viral rebound, cell surface markers of apoptosis and activation declined in total CD3+ cells and CD3+/CD4+ cells twofold to fourfold in 4 of 5 adherent study subjects at 16 weeks, reaching levels comparable with those found in seronegative donors. Although low-dose MMF appears safe in late-stage HIV disease, this study did not demonstrate virologic efficacy. Higher doses of MMF may be more effective. With careful monitoring of toxicities and pharmacokinetics, MMF deserves further testing in HIV therapy."
8218,0.001,1.0000,"The aetiology of autoimmune diseases remains unknown. The relationship between virus, and more recently retrovirus, has been suggested with this group of diseases. Immunoblotting is a useful method for determining the presence of proteins coded by different retrovirus genes. Since the prevalence of these types of proteins in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and autoimmune thyroid diseases has not been fully established, the aim of this work was to determine the prevalence of antibodies to immunodeficiency human virus type 1 (HIV-1) proteins in these diseases and their possible relationship with the presence of anti-nuclear, anti-DNA, anti-SSA (Ro) and anti-SSB (La) autoantibodies. Antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) were studied in a group of 341 patients with autoimmune diseases (77 SS, 98 SLE, 75 RA, 91 autoimmune thyroid diseases) and 126 blood donors as a control group. A Western blot was used to detect antibodies to HIV-1, and a double polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using nested primers in the gag and pol gene of HIV-1. Antinuclear antibodies, anti-DNA, anti-SSA (Ro) and anti-SSB (La) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. At least one band was shown on immunoblotting in 26% of patients with autoimmune diseases and 35% of controls. The presence of antibodies to p55 or p68 proteins in patients with SS or SLE proved to be the only statistically significant difference between the other autoimmune diseases studied and the control group.

422,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is associated with poor graft- and patient-survival. Treatment with HBV-specific immunoglobulins (HBIG) in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogs is effective in preventing HBV reinfection of the graft and improving OLT outcome. However, the role of HBV-specific cellular immunity in viral containment in immune suppressed patients in general and in OLT recipients in particular is unclear. To test whether or not OLT recipients maintain robust HBV-specific cellular immunity, the cellular immune response against HBV was assessed in 15 OLT recipients and 27 individuals with chronic and 24 subjects with self-limited HBV infection, respectively; using an overlapping peptide set spanning the viral nucleocapsid- and envelope-protein sequences. The data demonstrate that OLT recipients mounted fewer but stronger clusters of differentiation (CD)8 T cell responses than subjects with self-limited HBV infection and showed a preferential targeting of the nucleocapsid antigen. This focused response pattern was similar to responses seen in chronically infected subjects with undetectable viremia, but significantly different from patients who presented with elevated HBV viremia and who mounted mainly immune responses against the envelope protein. In conclusion, virus-specific CD4 T cell-mediated responses were only detected in subjects with self-limited HBV infection. Thus, the profile of the cellular immunity against HBV was in immune suppressed patients similar to subjects with chronic HBV infection with suppressed HBV-DNA."
6871,0.001,1.0000,"Interruption of suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected patients leads to increased HIV replication and viral rebound in peripheral blood. Effects of therapy interruption on gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) have not been well investigated. We evaluated longitudinal changes in viral replication and emergence of viral variants in the context of T cell homeostasis and gene expression in GALT of three HIV-positive patients who initiated HAART during primary HIV infection but opted to interrupt therapy thereafter. Longitudinal viral sequence analysis revealed that a stable proviral reservoir was established in GALT during primary HIV infection that persisted through early HAART and post-therapy interruption. Proviral variants in GALT and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) displayed low levels of genomic diversity at all times. A rapid increase in viral loads with a modest decline of CD4(+) T cells in peripheral blood was observed, while gut mucosal CD4(+) T cell loss was severe following HAART interruption. This was accompanied by increased mucosal gene expression regulating interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses and immune activation, a profile similar to those found in HAART-naive HIV-infected patients. Sequence analysis of rebound virus suggested that GALT was not the major contributor to the postinterruption plasma viremia nor were GALT HIV reservoirs rapidly replaced by HIV rebound variants. Our data suggest an early establishment and persistence of viral reservoirs in GALT with minimal diversity. Early detection of and therapy for HIV infection may be beneficial in controlling viral evolution and limiting establishment of diverse viral reservoirs in the mucosal compartment."
2215,0.001,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) early gene product Nef is a multifunctional protein that alters numerous pathways of T-cell function, including endocytosis, signal transduction, vesicular trafficking, and immune modulation, and is a major determinant of pathogenesis. Individual Nef functions include PAK-2 activation, CD4 downregulation, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I downregulation, and enhancement of viral particle infectivity. How Nef accomplishes its multiple tasks presents a difficult problem of mechanistic analysis because of the complications associated with multiple, overlapping functional domains in the context of significant sequence variability. To address these issues we determined the conservation of each Nef residue based on 1,643 subtype B Nef sequences. Mutational analysis based on conservative substitutions and Nef sequence data allowed us to search for amino acids on the surface of Nef that are specifically required for PAK-2 activation. We found residues 85, 89, and 191 to be highly significant determinants for Nef's PAK-2 activation function but functionally unlinked to CD4 and MHC class I downregulation or enhancement of infectivity. These residues are not conserved across HIV-1 subtypes but are confined to separate sets of surface elements within a subtype. Thus, L85/H89/F191 and F85/F89/R191 are dominant in subtype B and subtype E or C, respectively. Our results provide support for developing subtype-specific interventions in HIV-1 disease."
3885,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef downregulates major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), impairing the clearance of infected cells by CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). While sequence motifs mediating this function have been determined by in vitro mutagenesis studies of laboratory-adapted HIV-1 molecular clones, it is unclear whether the highly variable Nef sequences of primary isolates in vivo rely on the same sequence motifs. To address this issue, nef quasispecies from nine chronically HIV-1-infected persons were examined for sequence evolution and altered MHC-I downregulatory function under Gag-specific CTL immune pressure in vitro. This selection resulted in decreased nef diversity and strong purifying selection. Site-by-site analysis identified 13 codons undergoing purifying selection and 1 undergoing positive selection. Of the former, only 6 have been reported to have roles in Nef function, including 4 associated with MHC-I downregulation. Functional testing of naturally occurring in vivo polymorphisms at the 7 sites with no previously known functional role revealed 3 mutations (A84D, Y135F, and G140R) that ablated MHC-I downregulation and 3 (N52A, S169I, and V180E) that partially impaired MHC-I downregulation. Globally, the CTL pressure in vitro selected functional Nef from the in vivo quasispecies mixtures that predominately lacked MHC-I downregulatory function at the baseline. Overall, these data demonstrate that CTL pressure exerts a strong purifying selective pressure for MHC-I downregulation and identifies novel functional motifs present in Nef sequences in vivo."
1277,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication is linked to cellular gene transcription and requires target cell activation. The latent reservoir of HIV-1 in quiescent T cells is thought to be a major obstacle to clearance of infection by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Thus, identification of agents that can induce expression of latent virus may, in the presence of HAART, allow elimination of the infected cells by the immune response. We previously used the SCID-hu (Thy/Liv) mouse model to establish that activation-inducible HIV can be generated at high frequency during thymopoiesis. Latently infected mature thymocytes can be exported into the periphery, providing an efficient primary cell model to determine cellular activation signals that induce renewed expression of latent virus. Here we characterized the effects of prostratin, a non-tumor-promoting phorbol ester, on primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and assessed its ability to reactivate latent HIV infection from thymocytes and PBLs in the SCID-hu (Thy/Liv) model. Prostratin stimulation alone did not induce proliferation of quiescent PBLs; however, it could provide a secondary signal in the context of T-cell receptor stimulation or a primary activation signal in the presence of CD28 stimulation to induce T-cell proliferation. While prostratin alone was not sufficient to allow de novo HIV infection, it efficiently reactivated HIV expression from latently infected cells generated in the SCID-hu mouse. Our data indicate that prostratin alone is able to specifically reactivate latent virus in the absence of cellular proliferation, making it an attractive candidate for further study as an adjunctive therapy for the elimination of the latent HIV reservoir."
8431,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1 escape from surveillance by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) is thought to cause at least transient weakening of immune control. However, the CTL response is highly adaptable and the long-term consequences of viral escape are not fully understood. The objective of this study was to address the question ""to what extent does HIV-1 escape from CTL contribute to HLA-associated AIDS progression?"" We combined an analysis of 21 escape events in longitudinally-studied HIV-1 infected people with a population-level analysis of the functional CTL response in 150 subjects (by IFNg ELISpot) and an analysis of the HIV-1 sequence database to quantify the contribution of escape to the HLA-associated rate of AIDS progression. We found that CTL responses restricted by protective HLA class I alleles, which are associated with slow progression to AIDS, recognised epitopes where escape variants had a weak evolutionary selective advantage (P = 0.008) and occurred infrequently (P = 0.017). Epitopes presented by protective HLA class I alleles were more likely to elicit a CTL response (P = 0.001) and less likely to contain sequence variation (P = 0.006). A third of between-individual variation in HLA-associated disease risk was predicted by the selective advantage of escape variants: a doubling in the evolutionary selective advantage was associated with a decrease in the AIDS-free period of 1.2 yrs. These results contribute to our understanding of what makes a CTL response protective and why some individuals progress to AIDS more rapidly than others."
2728,0.001,1.0000,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are part of the cellular immune response to human persistent virus infections. Measurements of the frequency and specificity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CTL and their variation with time may indicate their relative importance in modulating the progression of HIV-1 infection. We have used limiting dilution analysis (LDA) to derive quantitative estimates of the frequency of HIV-1-specific CTL precursors in a cross-sectional study of 23 patients at different clinical stages of HIV-1 infection and to compare these with the frequency of CTL precursors specific for another persistent virus (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]) in the same patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated in vitro with autologous HIV-1-infected lymphoblasts and assayed for cytotoxicity in 51Cr release assays against autologous and MHC-mismatched lymphoblastoid B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the three HIV-1 structural gene products. The frequency of MHC-restricted precursors was high in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (env-specific CTL precursors up to 73/10(6) PBMC; gag-specific CTL precursors up to 488/10(6) PBMC), although the relative frequency against the different structural gene products varied from patient to patient. The HIV-1-specific CTL precursor frequency was reduced in patients who had more severe (< 400/microliters) CD4+ lymphocyte depletion, while in the majority of such patients the frequency of CTL precursors against EBV was maintained at levels observed in healthy controls. Direct CTL activity in unstimulated PBMC was observed in three of nine patients but no correlation was found between the presence of an activated CTL response and the magnitude of the CTL response detected after stimulation in LDA. Thus, CTL precursors were detected against all three HIV-1 structural gene products in patients with CD4+ lymphocyte counts > 400/microliters, at frequencies that are high compared with those reported for other persistent viruses. A CTL response directed against multiple protein antigens of HIV-1 may protect the patient against epitope variation. The fact that the EBV-specific CTL precursor frequencies were maintained in advanced HIV-1 infection suggests that there may be selective impairment of the HIV-1-specific CTL response associated with disease progression."
2323,0.001,1.0000,"A defect in specific T cell immunity has long been assumed to be the central mechanism of persistent Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Recent studies on HBV transgenic mice have suggested, however, that functional deficit of dendritic cells (DC) was an underlying cause for the T cell dysfunction. The functions of monocyte-derived DC were determined by studying 75 subjects that included chronic hepatitis B patients with low or high HBV load; antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) positive individuals who had recovered completely from previous acute HBV infection; healthy donors who had received hepatitis B vaccination and were anti-HBs positive; and immunologically naïve to HBV or the vaccine individual. Impaired interactions between monocyte-derived DC and T cells were shown in chronic HBV infection patients, especially in those with active virus replication. The dysfunctions included: (i) failure of DC to increase human leukocyte antigen (HLA-II), B7 expression and interleukin-12 secretion in responses to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), (ii) defective induction of T cell proliferative response to HBsAg, (iii) failure to activate T cells to produce cytokines and (iv) deficit in the induction of antigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In vitro treatment of DC with tumour necrosis factor-alpha improved HLA-II and B7 expression, as well as Th cell and CTL responses. It is concluded that defective DC-T cell interactions may account for the specific T cell immune defects in chronic HBV infection. Immunotherapy that aims at restoring DC functions could offer a new opportunity for effectively managing persistent HBV infections."
2964,0.001,1.0000,"An important driving force behind the sequence diversity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is viral adaptation to host immune responses. To gain an insight into the impact of host immunity on genetic diversification and properties of HBV, we characterized HBV of genotype D from treatment-naive hepatitis B e antigen-positive (EP) and hepatitis B e antigen-negative (EN) patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), where HBV is under stronger immune pressure, with that of HBV derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV-coinfected individuals, where HIV infection has significantly weakened the immune system. Full-length sequence analysis showed that HBV heterogeneity was most extensive in EN-CHB followed by EP-CHB and HIV/HBV coinfection. The relative magnitude of non-synonymous changes within B-cell epitopes was greater than that in T-cell epitopes of HBV open reading frames (ORFs) in both EP-CHB and EN-CHB. Nine amino acid substitutions were identified in B-cell epitopes and one in a T-cell epitope of HBV in EN-CHB, most of which resulted in altered hydrophobicities, as determined using the Kyte and Doolittle method, relative to wild-type residues found in HBV from the HIV-positive group. Additionally, 19 substitutions occurred at significantly higher frequencies in non-epitope regions of HBV ORF-P in EN-CHB than HIV/HBV-coinfected patients. In vitro replication assay demonstrated that the substitutions, particularly in reverse transcriptase and RNaseH domains of ORF-P, resulted in a decline in replication capacity of HBV. Hence, our results indicate that HBV adapts to increasing immune pressure through preferential mutations in B-cell epitopes and by replicative attenuation. The viral epitopes linked to immune response identified in this study bear important implications for future HBV vaccine studies."
2198,0.001,1.0000,"Polymorphisms of genes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, particularly those encoding HLA-DR, have been suggested as markers of susceptibility to Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). We conducted a case-control study comparing 147 homosexual men who developed KS after infection by human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) with 147 matched dually infected men without HIV-associated KS (HIV-KS) from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. HLA-B, DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, and DQB1 polymorphisms were examined by high-resolution DNA-based methods. Differences in distributions of genetic variants were tested by conditional logistic regression. Previously reported relationships with HLA-DRB1 alleles could not be confirmed. Instead, other associations were observed. In univariate analysis, KS was weakly associated with B*2702/5 (odds ratio (OR)=0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.18-0.91). Similar or stronger associations, positive or negative, were seen for haplotypes containing class II alleles: DRB1*1302-DQB1*0604 (OR=3.67, 95% CI=1.02-13.1), DRB4 (DR53) haplotype family members [OR=0.52, 95% CI=0.32-0.85], and DRB3 (DR52) haplotype family members (OR=1.69, 95% CI=1.07-2.67). The B*1402-DRB1*0102 haplotype, which invariably contains the V281L mutation in the 21-hydroxylase gene governing adrenal steroid biosynthesis, occurred in five cases and one control (OR=5.0, 95% CI=0.58-42.8). In a final multivariable analysis, only DRB1*1302-DQB1*0604 (OR=6.43, 95% CI=1.28-32.3, P=0.02) remained significantly associated with KS. Associations of HLA-DRB families with HIV-KS could reflect underlying immune dysregulation. The HLA B*1402-DRB1*0102 haplotype associated with increased risk of KS might represent an antigen-presenting pathway unfavorable for immune response to HHV8. Alternatively, the relationship might hold a clue to the predilection of KS for men because that haplotype harbors the mutant form of the 21-hydroxylase gene."
731,0.001,1.0000,"Children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are living longer. Studies aimed at understanding the health and well-being of these children as they age into adolescence are enhanced by research designs that include appropriate comparison groups. HIV-exposed but uninfected children are one such comparison group; however, recruitment of this comparison group is challenging because uninfected children may no longer be followed at tertiary care centres, and some may be in foster care or no longer living with their biological parents. This paper describes the recruitment methods, sampling plan, and factors associated with enrolling perinatally HIV-infected children and a comparison group of HIV-exposed but uninfected children into the HIV Follow-up Of Perinatally Exposed Children (PACTS-HOPE) prospective cohort study. The source population consists of HIV-infected and uninfected children originally enrolled in the Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Study (PACTS). Recruitment took place at paediatric HIV clinics in four US locations between March 2001 and March 2003. A total of 182 HIV-infected and 180 uninfected children were enrolled. Enrolment of uninfected children was much harder than that of infected children because the former often could not be located. After adjusting for site and birth-year category, uninfected children born to white mothers were significantly less likely to be enrolled (P < 0.01). There was a trend for infected and uninfected children of mothers with a history of injection drug use to enrol at lower rates. Although recruitment of the uninfected comparison group was challenging, it was nevertheless facilitated by hierarchical recruitment techniques, involvement of family networks, and continuity of study staff. The PACTS-HOPE cohort will provide opportunities for future research aimed at understanding the unique effects of HIV on the well-being of HIV-infected children."
5376,0.001,1.0000,"Increasing evidence points to a role of the mitogenic Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade in regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression. Stimulation of elements of this pathway leads to transactivation of the HIV-1 promoter. In particular, the NF-kappaB motif in the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) represents a Raf-responsive element in fibroblasts. Regulation of the Raf kinase in T cells differs from findings with a variety of cell lines that the catalytic domain of Raf (Raf(delta26-303)) shows no activity. In this study, we restored the activity of the kinase in T cells by fusing its catalytic domain to the CAAX motif (-Cx) of Ras, thus targeting the enzyme to the plasma membrane. Constitutive activity of Raf was demonstrated by phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and endogenous mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in A3.01 T cells transfected with Raf(delta26-303)-Cx. Membrane-targeted Raf also stimulates NF-kappaB, as judged by kappaB-dependent reporter assays and enhanced NF-kappaB p65 binding on band shift analysis. Moreover, we found that active Raf transactivates the HIV(NL4-3) LTR in A3.01 T lymphocytes and that dominant negative Raf (C4) blocked 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced transactivation. When cotransfected with infectious HIV(NL4-3) DNA, membrane-targeted Raf induces viral replication up to 10-fold over basal levels, as determined by the release of newly synthesized p24gag protein. Our study clearly demonstrates that the activity of the catalytic domain of Raf in A3.01 T cells is dependent on its cellular localization. The functional consequences of active Raf in T lymphocytes include not only NF-kappaB activation and transactivation of the HIV(NL4-3) LTR but also synthesis and release of HIV particles."
8757,0.001,1.0000,"We have observed that CD4 T lymphocytes from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients marginally express interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) beta and IL-2R gamma chains which are essential for IL-2 signal transduction. To analyze this observation further, we studied the influence of gp120 on the cell surface expression of IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma by purified CD4 lymphocytes in vitro. Cross-linking of the T cell receptors of these lymphocytes initiates entry into the cell cycle as measured by CD69 and CD71 cell surface expression and [3H]thymidine incorporation. It also induces the cell surface expression of IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma. We have shown that treatment of the CD4 T lymphocytes with HIV-1 gp120 before anti-CD3 stimulation impedes cell cycle progression as measured by reduced CD71 expression and inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation. Furthermore, cell surface expression of IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma subunits, which from the functional intermediate-affinity IL-2R, are significantly inhibited. More importantly, addition of exogenous IL-2 does not restore the proliferation of the CD4 T cells treated with gp120, suggesting that cells are anergic and/or that the remaining IL-2R are not functional. This is the first study of IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma dysregulation in the context of HIV infection and shows that CD4 is also involved in IL-2R expression."
1654,0.001,1.0000,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal disorder in women of reproductive age, especially among women with HIV-1 infection. Several bacterial products including lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoteichoic acids (LTA), and peptidoglycans (PGN) are stimulatory ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and recent evidence indicates the important role of variation in TLR genes for permitting overgrowth of gram negative and BV-type flora. We assessed whether genetic polymorphisms in five TLR genes (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, and TLR9) could be determinants of differential host immune responses to BV in 159 HIV-1-positive African American adolescents enrolled in the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) study. BV was assessed biannually and diagnosed either by a Nugent score of at least 7 of 10, or using the Amsel criteria. Cox-proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for concurrent Chlamydia and Gonorrhea infections, douching, and absolute CD4 cell count, were used to identify host genetic factors associated with BV. Two SNPs were associated with BV as diagnosed by the Nugent score and the combined criteria: a minor allele G of rs4986790 (frequency=0.07), which encodes a His to Tyr substitution in TLR4 (HR=1.47, 95% CI 1.15-1.87) and rs187084 (frequency=0.24) on TLR9. The minor allele of rs1898830 (frequency=0.13) was associated with an increased hazard of BV defined by the Amsel criteria (HR=1.86, 95% CI 1.17-2.95). Further studies are warranted to confirm the associations of TLR gene variants and also to understand the underlying pathways and immunogenetic correlates in the context of HIV-1 infection."
5129,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-infected individuals with 200-500 CD4(+) T cell/microl were enrolled in a controlled study of three interleukin 2 (IL-2) plus antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens: (1) continuous intravenous administration of 12 million international units (MIU) of IL-2 followed by subcutaneous high-dose IL-2 (7.5 MIU, twice daily) for 5 days every 8 weeks; (2) high-dose subcutaneous IL-2 for 5 days every 8 weeks; (3) low-dose (3 MIU, twice daily) subcutaneous IL-2 for 5 days every 4 weeks; and (4) ART alone. Serum concentrations of IL-2, soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-6 were determined. A progressive decrease over time of the circulating levels of IL-2 was observed in individuals receiving the highest doses of IL-2, but not in those belonging to the low-dose arm. Conversely, increased levels of sIL-2R were observed in all cytokine-treated individuals. The levels of TNF-alpha increased in the high-dose IL-2 regimens, but decreased in individuals receiving low-dose IL-2. IL-2-related toxicity was significantly correlated to the peak IL-2 serum levels, and was substantially lower in those individuals receiving low-dose IL-2. In conclusion, intermittent IL-2 administration causes the elevation of peripheral CD4(+) T cells, but also a profound cytokine response and systemic toxicity. The latter was correlated to the peak serum level of IL-2, but not to those of TNF-alpha and IL-6."
6726,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence of circulating immune complexes (CIC), their role and their relationship to cell-mediated immunity in patients with hepatitis B virus associated liver disease are still controversial. This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of CIC and their relationship to viral markers, to subsets of peripheral blood T lymphocytes and to suppressor cell activity in patients with hepatitis B virus associated liver diseases. CIC were positive in 29.3% of 41 healthy HBsAg carriers, 37.8% of 88 patients with hepatitis B virus associated liver diseases, and 15% of 41 healthy subjects by the platelet aggregation test (PAT). The prevalence of CIC in patients with acute hepatitis (40.0%) and in those with cirrhosis (61.5%) was significantly higher than in normal controls (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.005 respectively). There was no correlation between the titer of CIC and serum HBsAg titer or the status of HBeAg, and no significant decrease in the peripheral blood lymphocyte CD4/CD8 ratio in healthy HBsAg carriers (1.39 +/- 0.31) and in patients with liver diseases (1.40 +/- 0.54) compared to the normal controls (1.48 +/- 0.31). Concanavalin A induced suppressor cell activity on IgG producing cells was impaired in healthy HBsAg carriers (34.9%) (p less than 0.005) and in patients with liver diseases (25.3%) (p less than 0.0001), and this change was prominent in patients with chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis (p less than 0.0001). And there was a significant reverse correlation between concanavalin A induced suppressor cell activity on IgG-producing cells and the titer of CIC in PAT positive patients with hepatitis B virus associated liver diseases. In conclusion, it was suggested that defective suppressor cell function may lead to an increased B cell activation and such activity may account for the presence of CIC."
2409,0.001,1.0000,"Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia have been observed in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex. To investigate whether red cells (RBCs) of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection were coated with IgG and/or complement (C3), blood samples of 239 patients were tested. The prevalence of a positive direct antiglobulin test on RBCs was 16.7 percent. By use of an enzyme-linked antiglobulin test (ELAT) to measure more accurately the number of IgG molecules per RBC in a group of 67 patients, 30 of the 67 individuals were observed to have increased numbers (mean, 155) compared to normal controls and to patients with hypergammaglobulinemia due to multiple myeloma or chronic liver disease. Hemoglobin level was correlated with the number of IgG molecules per RBC (p = 0.008), but no correlation could be demonstrated between those numbers and serum immunoglobulin (p = 0.10) or circulating immune complexes (p = 0.38). Our results with ELAT suggest that some AIDS patients may have specific binding of IgG on the surface of their RBCs, rather than nonspecific uptake; further clinical correlations are necessary to confirm these findings."
1158,0.001,1.0000,"For 89 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and 32 HIV-negative immunocompromised patients who had 121 episodes of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), clinical features and changes over time were compared. HIV-infected patients characteristically had a longer duration of symptoms (23 vs. 13 days; P<.005); were younger (39 vs. 48 years; P<.001); had a higher frequency of sweating, weight loss, and thoracic pain; and had fewer admissions to the intensive care unit (16% vs. 31%; P<.05). In addition, they had significantly higher hemoglobin levels, lower thrombocyte counts, lower C-reactive protein values, and a higher proportion of eosinophils and lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. After 1995, HIV-negative patients' mean length of stay dropped from 34 days to 16 days (P<.005), and their hospital mortality rate dropped from 29% to 7% (P<.001). HIV-positive patients with PCP differed in several aspects from those without HIV infection. Knowledge gained from experience with treatment of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS has improved the management of PCP in patients with other immunodeficiencies."
3357,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with central nervous system (CNS) involvement causes a variety of psychiatric complications among a significant proportion of infected individuals. A cure for the fully developed AIDS related to HIV infection remains elusive, and HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death among adults between the ages of 25 and 44. Life expectancy, however, has gradually increased over the years, resulting in a concern for a potential increase in the incidence of secondary psychiatric manifestations. Knowledge of the neuropathology of HIV-CNS dysfunction and familiarity with its clinical presentation can aid clinicians in a determination of the appropriate therapy inclusive of psychiatric care that may be useful for a specific individual in their treatment."
351,0.001,1.0000,"This paper's design is descriptive and correlational based on retrospective self-report survey data collected in Kunming city, China. The study investigated the difference between a group of Chinese HIV positive (N=36) and negative (N=131) opioid dependent adults maintained on methadone treatment. Comparisons were based on their quality of life (QOL), methadone treatment adherence, adverse symptom occurrence related to methadone treatment, and HIV-related behavior changes. No significant differences were found between the two groups in age, methadone maintenance dose, methadone adherence, sex desire, and drug craving level. Participants who were HIV positive reported significantly lower scores on physical health and total health-related qualify of life. They also reported greater engagement in injection related risk behavior before methadone treatment than those who tested HIV negative. For both groups, sexual and injection risk behavior significantly decreased following initiation of methadone treatment. A regression model revealed that those infected with HIV, associated significantly with higher likelihood of reporting constipation and lack of appetite, and higher frequency of reporting abdominal pain and nausea than HIV negative patients. The primary implication of these findings is that HIV positive persons in methadone treatment may require more focused services to meet their special HIV care and substance treatment needs."
