7098,0.07,14.0000,"Only some twenty years has passed since the first discovery of severe immunodeficiency among previously healthy homosexual men through the discovery of the causing virus and till the status today where the knowledge on the HIV virus and the pathogenic mechanisms induced by the virus are extensive, though still incomplete. Furthermore, steadily better treatments have been introduced at a paste that is probably without precedents. These processes have been fuelled by various molecular biological methods. The abilities to quantify viremia and to sequence virus and hence describe the evolution of the virus represent valuable tools for understanding the pathogenic processes. The current thesis describes some of the findings obtained. While it was initially thought that the virological profile mimicked the clinical with an acute infection followed for years by clinical latency and only after on average ten years signs of severe immunodeficiency, this understanding has been revised. There is no virological latency. The viral replication is on going throughout the infection. However, the virological profile does resemble the clinical. Viremia is high shortly after infection; hereafter declines, and stabilises around what has been termed the viral set point. This level of viremia is predictive of the clinical course of the infection. We have shown that the viremic levels, measured both as HIV RNA load and proviral DNA load, early in infection carry significant information about the course of the infection. It is; however, not only early viral loads that carry prognostic information, also viral load during late-stage infection is clinically informative. Viral load measurements have evolved as the major tool for monitoring the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy. HIV RNA has been shown to be a good surrogate marker for the clinical efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. How to use the measurements most optimally has however not been fully delineated. Various methods for describing virological response might yield different results, and it is recommended that the pros and cons of the various methods be investigated. In a cohort of patients who had obtained good virological suppression on antiretroviral therapy followed prospectively for two years we found that only few patients experienced high-grade viremia. Furthermore, baseline HIV DNA differed between the patients with various longitudinal HIV RNA profiles. The patients with the most pronounced HIV RNA suppression had lowest proviral load at baseline, with a clear gradient across the groups. The interplay between proviral load and treatment response deserves further investigations. Resistance can develop against all the available antiretrovirals. The high turnover rate of HIV along with the error-prone reverse transcriptase leads to the possibility of steady accumulation of resistance mutations if the viremic suppression is incomplete. While the interplay between viremia and resistance development is clear-cut for some antiretrovirals i.e. Lamivudine, the pattern is more complex for i.e. Zidovudine. With the availability of assays for resistances testing the knowledge on this issue has been ever evolving. How to use resistance testing in the clinical monitoring of patients remains to be clarified. Resistance testing can aid in the process of choosing salvage therapy for patients experiencing virological failure. Whether resistance testing will be of clinical benefit in other situations remains to be determined. Investigation of the viral sequences and evolution herein has not only been used for resistance analyses, but also for tracing the spread of the infection. HIV-1 exists in many subtypes, with various geographic distributions. Hence subtype analyses have been used to investigate the introduction and spread of the HIV infection into many countries. Phylogenetic analyses have also been used to investigate nosocomial transmission events. We used analyses of env and gag sequences to trace a case of nosocomial infection at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Denmark. The study underlines the importance of steady awareness of the infection control precautions and possible breaks herein. The usefulness of this type of analyses was confirmed. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic various replicative patterns were described. Virus obtained from patients with late-stage infection often had virus that could induce syncytium formation (SI) when cultured, while virus obtained from patients in the early stages of infection did not have this ability. A correlation between the SI ability and the ability to yield high virus titres rapidly as well as the ability to establish infection in certain cell lines was found. Patients infected with SI virus experience more rapid clinical deterioration. We found that patients harbouring SI virus have HIV RNA loads no different from patients harbouring NSI virus. This is in line with the findings of other groups. Though patients harbouring SI virus had a more rapid development of resistance when treated with nucleoside reserve transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI's) monotherapy, this was not the case when treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HAART is today considered the treatment modality of choice; both for established HIV-infection and in cases where post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is given in order to prevent establishment of infection after exposure. In a case of transfusion of HIV-contaminated though HIV antibody negative blood the recipient was treated with HAART. As the risk of infection is close to 100% under these circumstances the fact that the recipient remained uninfected is probably attributable to the prompt initiation and thorough maintenance of PEP. PEP is recommended to health care workers after percutaneous HIV exposure as well as after sexual exposure. Even with NRTI monotherapy PEP has been shown to be efficacious. While the explanation for the dichotomy (SI vs. NSI) was for many years unresolved, it is now known that this is due to the requirements of the virus for different co-receptors for cell entry. SI virus uses mainly CXCR4 while NSI virus uses CCR5. Being heterozygous for a 32 basepair deletion in the gene encoding CCR5 leads to slower disease progression. We have shown that heterozygotes have lower HIV RNA levels in the early years of the infection, possibly explaining the clinical advantage of having the deletion. HIV replicates in activated cells, and there is an intriguing interplay between HIV replication and immune activation. HIV-infected patients have elevated levels of immunoglobulins. HIV induces polygonal immunoglobulin production. We found that patients experiencing good virological suppression of HAART had lower IgA levels than patients with less complete viral suppression. Whether IgA can be used as a marker for imminent viral break-through remains to be determined. The full understanding of the interplay between immune activation and HIV replication awaits further studies. The finding of increased viremia in conjunction with acute bacterial or viral infection led to concerns about the safety of vaccinating HIV-infected patients against influenza and pneumococcal infection. We found no difference in HIV RNA levels measured before and median 42 days after anti-pneumococcal vaccination. This is in line with many other studies showing either no or only transient increases in viremia. In conclusion, the knowledge on HIV virology has expanded tremendously. This has led to significant improvements in treatments in the Western World leading to declines in HIV morbidity and mortality. The ability to quantify viral load and to perform sequence analyses represent valuable tools both for understanding the pathogenic actions of the virus and for the clinical monitoring of HIV-infected patients. The optimal usage of these tools in the clinical setting, however, still remains to be defined. The progresses obtained have unfortunately been restricted to the Western World and the calamities of HIV is spreading and worsening in the Developing World. The progress in the development of a vaccine has been disappointing and it is urgently necessary that the progresses obtained within the fields of prevention and treatment are translated into useful strategies in the parts of the world mostly affected by the HIV pandemic."
6919,0.02,4.0000,"This consensus document has been prepared by a panel consisting of members of the AIDS Study Group (Gesida) and the Spanish Secretariat for the National Plan on AIDS (SPNS) after reviewing the efficacy and safety results of clinical trials, cohort and pharmacokinetic studies published in medical journals, or presented in medical scientific meetings. Gesida has prepared an objective and structured method to prioritise combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) in naïve patients. Recommendations strength (A, B, C) and the evidence which supports them (I, II, III) are based on a modification of the Infectious Diseases Society of America criteria. The current antiretroviral treatment (ART) of choice for chronic HIV infection is the combination of three drugs. ART is recommended in patients with symptomatic HIV infection, in pregnancy, in serodiscordant couples with high transmission risk, hepatitis B fulfilling treatment criteria, and HIV nephropathy. Guidelines on ART treatment in patients with concurrent diagnosis of HIV infection and an opportunistic type C infection are included. In asymptomatic patients ART is recommended on the basis of CD4 lymphocyte counts, plasma viral load and patient co-morbidities, as follows: 1) therapy should be started in patients with CD4 counts <350 cells/μL; 2) when CD4 counts are between 350 and 500 cells/μL, therapy will be recommended and only delayed if patient is reluctant to take it, the CD4 are stabilised, and the plasma viral load is low; 3) therapy could be deferred when CD4 counts are above 500 cells/μL, but should be considered in cases of cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C, high cardiovascular risk, plasma viral load >10(5) copies/mL, proportion of CD4 cells <14%, and in people aged >55 years. ART should include 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors nucleoside analogues and a third drug (non-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor or integrase inhibitor). The panel has consensually selected and given priority to using the Gesida score for some drug combinations, some of them co-formulated. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable viral load. Adherence to therapy plays an essential role in maintaining antiviral response. Therapeutic options are limited after ART failures, but an undetectable viral load may be possible nowadays. Adverse events are a fading problem of ART. Guidelines in acute HIV infection, in women, in pregnancy, and to prevent mother-to-child transmission and pre- and post-exposition prophylaxis are commented upon. Management of hepatitis B or C co-infection, other co-morbidities, and the characteristics of ART in HIV-2 infection are included."
710,0.015,3.0000,"Advanced HIV disease, defined as a CD4 cell count below 200 cells/μl or the presence of an AIDS-defining illness, remains common among HIV-infected individuals who first present for medical care. In developed countries, nearly 30% of new HIV diagnoses occurred at advanced stages of the disease, and it is important because advanced HIV disease has been associated with worse clinical outcomes, including lower rates of virological response, higher morbidity, and higher mortality. However, there are scarce data regarding which is the best antiretroviral regimen in these patients. Nowadays, integrase inhibitor-based regimens are widely recommended as the best initial therapy for treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients by all international guidelines. However, these guidelines hardly mention the recommended regimens in individuals with advanced HIV disease. Otherwise, recent data indicating a higher risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome associated to the use of integrase inhibitors have raised concerns on the use of these drugs in patients with advanced HIV disease. The aim of this article is to review the available evidence from randomized clinical trials for the best treatment in patients with advanced HIV disease."
1000,0.015,3.0000,"Golgi protein-73 (GP73) is upregulated in cancers and viral infections; however, its role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) remains undetermined. GP73 was evaluated as a biomarker of HIV progression and AIDS treatment efficacy. Forty-eight HIV patients (≤ 350 CD4 + T cells/μL) undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART group) and 18 HIV patients expected to undergo HAART within 9 months (>350 CD4 + T cells/μL) (control group) were enrolled in a prospective, single center, cohort study from May 2009 to Jun 2012. Blood aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cholesterol, triglycerides, and total bilirubin were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (HAART group) or 3 month intervals (control group). Serum HIV RNA level (viral load) was determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) GP73 concentration were determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay kit and western blot, respectively. Significant positive and negative correlations in baseline serum GP73 concentration and HIV viral load (r = 0.39, P < 0.001) and CD4 + T cell count (r = -0.501, P < 0.001) were observed, respectively. In receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.79 (95 % CI 0.66-0.92). The sensitivity and specificity of GP73 for correct identification of patients with ≤350 CD4 + T cells/μL were 76.09 and 75.0 %, respectively, with an ROC-derived cut-off of 100.6 ng/mL. For HIV patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy, GP73 may be a potential biomarker treatment efficacy useful in AIDS management."
2416,0.01,2.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) constitute the main burden of infectious disease in resource-limited countries. In the individual host, the two pathogens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV, potentiate one another, accelerating the deterioration of immunological functions. In high-burden settings, HIV coinfection is the most important risk factor for developing active TB, which increases the susceptibility to primary infection or reinfection and also the risk of TB reactivation for patients with latent TB. M. tuberculosis infection also has a negative impact on the immune response to HIV, accelerating the progression from HIV infection to AIDS. The clinical management of HIV-associated TB includes the integration of effective anti-TB treatment, use of concurrent antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevention of HIV-related comorbidities, management of drug cytotoxicity, and prevention/treatment of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). "
325,0.01,2.0000,"The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with tuberculosis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons living in Switzerland, a country with low prevalence of tuberculous infection. We performed a nested case-control study and logistic regression. Cases (n = 239) were patients participating in the Swiss-HIV Cohort study (n = 7,103), diagnosed with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis. The rest of the cohort population was used as control. Patients from industrialized countries had a risk of tuberculosis similar to those from Switzerland (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.7-1.5); whereas the risk among patients from Eastern Europe (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.9-3.7), Brazil (OR 10.6; 95% CI 9.6-11.5), and Africa (OR 3.0; 95% CI 2.4-3.6) was markedly higher. Immune suppression, as indicated by low CD4 + cell count, was an independent risk factor for tuberculosis (OR 7.8; 95% CI 7.3-8.3 for patients with CD4 + < 50 cells.mm-3 compared to those with CD4 + > 500 cells.mm-3). Age, sex and HIV-transmission category did not appear to increase the risk of tuberculosis after adjustment for other patient characteristics. In conclusion, in countries of low prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, to originate from a country with high prevalence of tuberculosis infection and to have advanced immunodeficiency are significant risk factors for tuberculosis. They may be used to complement the tuberculin skin test in targeting patients for preventive chemotherapy."
3769,0.01,2.0000,"The efficacy of specifically targeted anti-viral therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) (STAT-C), including HCV protease and polymerase inhibitors, is limited by the presence of drug-specific viral resistance mutations within the targeted proteins. Genetic diversity within these viral proteins also evolves under selective pressures provided by host human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted immune responses, which may therefore influence STAT-C treatment response. Here, the prevalence of drug resistance mutations relevant to 27 developmental STAT-C drugs, and the potential for drug and immune selective pressures to intersect at sites along the HCV genome, is explored. HCV nonstructural (NS) 3 protease or NS5B polymerase sequences and HLA assignment were obtained from study populations from Australia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Four hundred five treatment-naïve individuals with chronic HCV infection were considered (259 genotype 1, 146 genotype 3), of which 38.5% were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We identified preexisting STAT-C drug resistance mutations in sequences from this large cohort. The frequency of the variations varied according to individual STAT-C drug and HCV genotype/subtype. Of individuals infected with subtype 1a, 21.5% exhibited genetic variation at a known drug resistance site. Furthermore, we identified areas in HCV protease and polymerase that are under both potential HLA-driven pressure and therapy selection and identified six HLA-associated polymorphisms (P <or= 0.05) at known drug resistance sites."
6306,0.01,2.0000,"Risk factors for HIV-1 infection among women were assessed through a population-based cross-sectional study in the Arusha region of northern Tanzania. The study participants were obtained by randomly selecting 10-household clusters from Unga limited, the town of Babati, and the roadside village of Matufa, which are urban, semi-urban, and rural communities, respectively. Informed verbal consent for participation in an interview and in HIV-1 testing was sought from each respondent. Blood samples were collected from each consenting individual for HIV-1 antibody testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and all positive sera were confirmed using repeated ELISA tests. Information of risk factors was obtained through the interview process using a structured questionnaire. Of the 567 women who gave blood samples, 48 (8.5%) were HIV-1 positive. The HIV-1 seroprevalence rates among women in the urban area, the semi-urban area, and the rural village were 14.4%, 6.9% and 2.3%, respectively. Factors associated with significantly higher HIV-1 seroprevalence were urban residence; history of having traveled out of the Arusha region within Tanzania, as well as having traveled abroad; having multiple sex partners; and having sexual intercourse under the influence of alcohol. Women who reported ever having used condoms had significantly higher probability of being infected with HIV-1 than those who had never used condoms, suggesting that condom use may be a marker of high-risk sexual behavior and that condom use is probably not adhered to in a way that consistently protects against HIV-1 infection. These results suggest the need for health education interventions aimed at increasing appropriate and consistent condom use and reduction of the number of sexual partners."
8078,0.01,2.0000,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a DNA-binding transcription factor activated by multiple cytokines and interferons. High expression of STAT3 has also been implicated in cancer and lymphoma. Here, we show a case of B cell lymphoma in which a defective human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) integrated upstream of the first STAT3 coding exon. The lymphoma cells with anaplastic large cell morphology formed multiple nodular lesions in the lung of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patient with Kaposi's sarcoma. The provirus had a 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) deletion, but the 3' LTR had stronger promoter activity than the STAT3 promoter in reporter assays. Immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of STAT3 in the nuclei of lymphoma cells. Transfection of STAT3 resulted in transient cell proliferation in primary B cells in vitro. Although this is a very rare case of HIV-1-integrated lymphoma, these data suggest that up-regulation of STAT3 caused by HIV-1 integration resulted in the development of B cell lymphoma in this special case."
7540,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The likelihood of developing CHB is related to the age at which infection is acquired; the risk being lowest in adults and >90% in neonates whose mothers are hepatitis B e antigen positive. Treatment of CHB infection aims to clear HBV DNA and prevent the development of complications. There are currently seven drugs available for the treatment of CHB: five nucleos(t)ide analogues and two interferon-based therapies. Long-term treatment is often required, and the decision to treat is based on clinical assessment including the phase of CHB infection and the presence and extent of liver damage. A safe and effective HBV vaccine has been available since the early 1980s. Vaccination plays a central role in HBV prevention strategies worldwide, and a decline in the incidence and prevalence of HBV infection following the introduction of universal HBV vaccination programmes has been observed in many countries including the USA and parts of South East Asia and Europe. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with HBV vaccine +/- hepatitis B immunoglobulin is highly effective in preventing mother to child transmission and in preventing transmission following sharps injuries, sexual contact and other exposures to infected blood and body fluids. Transmission of HBV in the health care setting has become an increasingly rare event in developed nations. However, it remains a significant risk in developing countries reflecting the higher prevalence of CHB, limited access to HBV vaccination and PEP and a lack of adherence to standard infection control precautions."
8417,0.01,2.0000,"HIV-positive refugees confront a variety of challenges in accessing and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and attaining durable viral suppression; however, there is little understanding of what these challenges are, how they are navigated, or how they may differ across humanitarian settings. We sought to document and examine accounts of the threats, barriers and facilitators experienced in relation to HIV treatment and care and to conduct comparisons across settings. We conducted semi-structured interviews among a purposive sample of 14 refugees attending a public, urban HIV clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (July-September 2010), and 12 refugees attending a camp-based HIV clinic in Kakuma, Kenya (February-March 2011). We used framework methods and between-case comparison to analyze and interpret the data, identifying social and environmental factors that influenced adherence. The multiple issues that threatened adherence to antiretroviral therapy or precipitated actual adherence lapses clustered into three themes: ""migration"", ""insecurity"", and ""resilience"". The migration theme included issues related to crossing borders and integrating into treatment systems upon arrival in a host country. Challenges related to crossing borders were reported in both settings, but threats pertaining to integration into, and navigation of, a new health system were exclusive to the Malaysian setting. The insecurity theme included food insecurity, which was most commonly reported in the Kenyan setting; health systems insecurity, reported in both settings; and emotional insecurity, which was most common in the Kenyan setting. Resilient processes were reported in both settings. We drew on the concept of ""bounded agency"" to argue that, despite evidence of personal and community resilience, these processes were sometimes insufficient for overcoming social and environmental barriers to adherence. In general, interventions might aim to bolster individuals' range of action with targeted support that bolsters resilient processes. Specific interventions are needed to address locally-based food and health system insecurities. "
6463,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapies potentially suppress HBV viral load to an undetectable level reducing the risk of progressive liver disease and the development of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Adherence to antiviral therapies is imperative to achieve and maintain viral suppression. To date, there has been limited research on adherence to HBV therapies. Our study aimed to explore factors influencing adherence to antiviral therapy. A total of 29 participants consented to in-depth qualitative interviews at three outpatient clinics in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were initially classified as adherent or nonadherent and thematic analysis was used to identify dominant themes. Adherent behavior was reported by 59% (n = 17) of participants. Several themes influenced adherence including routine, fear of HBV-related disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, and forgetfulness. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to explore adherence to HBV antiviral therapy. An interplay of several dominant themes emerged from our data including fear of chronic HBV disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, routine, and forgetfulness. Study findings have the potential to change nursing clinical practice, especially the way nurses and other clinicians target key HBV treatment messages and education, while monitoring adherence."
7661,0.01,2.0000,"The availability of an increasing number of antiretroviral agents and the rapid evolution of new information have introduced substantial complexity into treatment regimens for persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation convened the Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV to develop guidelines for clinical management of HIV-infected adults and adolescents (CDC. Report of the NIH Panel To Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection and Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected adults and adolescents. MMWR. 1998;47[RR-5]:1-41). This report, which updates the 1998 guidelines, addresses 1) using testing for plasma HIV ribonucleic acid levels (i.e., viral load) and CD4+ T cell count; 2) using testing for antiretroviral drug resistance; 3) considerations for when to initiate therapy; 4) adherence to antiretroviral therapy; 5) considerations for therapy among patients with advanced disease; 6) therapy-related adverse events; 7) interruption of therapy; 8) considerations for changing therapy and available therapeutic options; 9) treatment for acute HIV infection; 10) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among adolescents; 11) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among pregnant women; and 12) concerns related to transmission of HIV to others. Antiretroviral regimens are complex, have serious side effects, pose difficulty with adherence, and carry serious potential consequences from the development of viral resistance because of nonadherence to the drug regimen or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents. Patient education and involvement in therapeutic decisions are critical. Treatment should usually be offered to all patients with symptoms ascribed to HIV infection. Recommendations for offering antiretroviral therapy among asymptomatic patients require analysis of real and potential risks and benefits. In general, treatment should be offered to persons who have <350 CD4+ T cells/mm3 or plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels of >55,000 copies/mL (by b-deoxyribonucleic acid [bDNA] or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] assays). The recommendation to treat asymptomatic patients should be based on the willingness and readiness of the person to begin therapy; the degree of existing immunodeficiency as determined by the CD4+ T cell count; the risk for disease progression as determined by the CD4+ T cell count and level of plasma HIV RNA; the potential benefits and risks of initiating therapy in an asymptomatic person; and the likelihood, after counseling and education, of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. Treatment goals should be maximal and durable suppression of viral load, restoration and preservation of immunologic function, improvement of quality of life, and reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Results of therapy are evaluated through plasma HIV RNA levels, which are expected to indicate a 1.0 log10 decrease at 2-8 weeks and no detectable virus (<50 copies/mL) at 4-6 months after treatment initiation. Failure of therapy at 4-6 months might be ascribed to nonadherence, inadequate potency of drugs or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents, viral resistance, and other factors that are poorly understood. Patients whose therapy fails in spite of a high level of adherence to the regimen should have their regimen changed; this change should be guided by a thorough drug treatment history and the results of drug-resistance testing. Because of limitations in the available alternative antiretroviral regimens that have documented efficacy, optimal changes in therapy might be difficult to achieve for patients in whom the preferred regimen has failed. These decisions are further confounded by problems with adherence, toxicity, and resistance. For certain patients, participating in a clinical trial with or without access to new drugs or using a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replicatioing a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replication might be preferable. Because concepts regarding HIV management are evolving rapidly, readers should check regularly for additional information and updates at the HIV/AIDS Treatment Information Service website ( http://www.hivatis.org )."
2483,0.01,2.0000,"Thalassemia is a congenital hemolytic disease caused by defective globin synthesis treated by blood transfusion. Transfusion-transmitted infections still make a great challenge in the management of patients with thalassemia major. The most important worldwide transfusion-transmitted infections are hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV. The objective of this study is to update the prevalence of the three major transfusion-transmitted infections HCV, HBV and HIV among thalassemic patients followed up in the Hematology Department, Children Hospital, Cairo University. The study included 174 multitransfused thalassemic patients (162 major and 12 intermedia), registered at the Pediatric Hematology Clinic, Cairo University. Their age ranged from 2 to 27 years with a mean of 11.26 ± 5.4 years. Patients were subjected to full history taking, stressing on history of blood transfusions (onset, frequency and duration) at a single or multiple centers and abdominal examination. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count, aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase), ferritin and viral markers of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) and anti-HIV were assayed for all cases by a third-generation ELISA method. HCV PCR was performed for 75 cases. Of the 174 patients, none of them were HBsAg and anti-HIV positive. However, 90 patients were anti-HCV positive (51.7%). HCV PCR was positive in 56 patients (74.3%) of the 75 with positive antibody tested. HCV antibody positivity is statistically significant with age of the patient, serum ferritin and liver transaminases (P < 0.01). HCV-RNA by PCR positivity was significantly related to patients' age and serum ferritin (P < 0.05). Serum ferritin showed statistically significant positive correlation with liver transaminases. Despite the decrease in prevalence of HCV antibody in our patients from 71% in 1995 to 51.7% in our study, yet HCV infection still represents a major health problem for our thalassemic patients, which requires more attention and efforts to challenge. There is a dramatic decrease in the prevalence of HBV infection over the last decade, thanks to mass compulsory vaccination and blood screening. HIV infection does not represent a problem owing to very low population prevalence."
4063,0.01,2.0000,"A 31-year-old African American woman with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (recent CD4 count of 66/mm) presented to the emergency room with a tension pneumothorax that required an emergent chest tube placement. Computed tomography scan showed fungus balls in multiple lung cavities and surrounding infiltrates. The patient showed remarkable improvement with voriconazole suggesting aspergillosis. However, the patient was serologically negative for Aspergillus and other common fungal infections. Because of a persistent air leak, surgical intervention was needed. The histological finding was consistent with invasive mycosis, and cultures were positive for Scedosporium apiospermum. Literature review showed that, among patients with HIV/AIDS, Scedosporium can present from focal localized to systemic disease, is resistant to traditional antifungal agents, and may respond to prompt management with voriconazole."
4023,0.01,2.0000,"The number of HIV-infected individuals with prior multiple treatment failures is increasing as time passes by. The success of antiretroviral therapy in these patients is often compromised by the selection of drug-resistant viruses. Despite initial concerns, a rebound in AIDS cases among heavily treatment-experienced patients failing virologically their antiretroviral therapy has not occurred yet. In a multicenter study conducted in Spain, HIV-infected patients were assessed with prior failure to antiretrovirals from the three main drug families who presented during the last semester of the year 2003 with plasma HIV-RNA values above 1,000 copies/ml, despite good treatment adherence. The relationships between CD4+ T cell counts, viral loads and drug-resistant genotypes were examined. A total of 273 patients were identified in 12 centers (78% male, median age: 41 years). The mean viral load was 50,438 copies/ml and the mean CD4+ count was 328 cells/mul. Only 19.5% had less than 200 CD4+ T cells/mul. Most patients (95%) were receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) in their last antiretroviral regimen, while 63% were treated with protease inhibitors (PI) and 27% on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Overall, 97.4% had at least one drug resistance mutation (87.2% for NRTI, 68.5% for NNRTI, and 92.7% for PI). Using the virtual phenotype, resistance to three or more drugs within each class was recognized in 45.8% for NRTI, 40.7% for NNRTI, and 44.7% for PI. Moreover, cross-resistance to compounds from two or three drug families was recognized in 41% and 19.4% of patients, respectively. Nearly half of the patients had plasma HIV-RNA below 10,000 copies/ml and they showed significantly higher CD4 + counts than those with greater viremia (408 versus 259 cells/mul; P < 0.001). Patients with higher plasma viremia had significantly more drug resistance mutations than those with lower viremia. No favorable effect on viral load could be recognized for individual drug resistance mutations known to reduce viral fitness in vitro (i.e., rtM184V, rtL74V, rtK65R, proD30N, or proI50L). In summary, a large proportion of treatment-experienced patients failing their current antiretroviral regimen carry viruses with broad cross-resistant genotypes. Nearly half of the patients with these multi-drug resistant viruses had < 10,000 HIV-RNA copies/ml and 80% have more than 200 CD4 + T cells/mul. Thus, maintaining treatment HIV-infected individuals failing virologically and harboring drug-resistant viruses might ameliorate immunological deterioration until new drugs became available. J. Med.

5450,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global major health problem. Currently, 10 genotypes (A-J) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are identified based on the nucleic acid sequence heterogeneity, and these genotypes have been shown to have distinct geographic distribution. Reports of the previous studies indicated that the genotype D is the predominant type among hepatitis B patients in different regions of Turkey. However, recent studies indicated that other HBV genotypes are also seen with an increasing rate. Although epidemiological and clinical information on genotype E infection is currently limited, it is known that genotype E infection is common in West and Central Africa. In this report, the first case of HBV genotype E infection in Turkey was presented. A 22-year-old Nigerian male employee who resided in Manisa for five years was admitted to Celal Bayar University Hospital Manisa, Turkey, for his routine check-up. Since HBsAg was found positive, other HBV markers were tested with a repeated serum sample. Laboratory findings were as follows; HBsAg (+), anti-HBs (-), HBeAg (-), anti-HBe (+), anti-HBc (+), anti-HCV (-), anti-HIV (-), ALT: 44 U/L and AST: 45 U/L. HBV-DNA level was detected as 700 IU/ml by real-time PCR (Artus HBV QS RGQ Qiagen, Germany). HBV-DNA isolated from the serum sample of the patient was amplified by PCR and polymerase gene segment of HBV was directly sequenced. UPGMA method was used for phylogenetic analysis and Inno-LIPA HBV genotyping method (Innogenetics, Belgium) was performed to determine multiple HBV genotype infection. On the basis of those methods the genotype of the virus was identified as genotype E. The partial sequences of the HBV polymerase gene were loaded to the international DNA data bank (GenBank) for contribution to the global HBV surveillance. This report emphasized that besides genotype D the other HBV genotypes could be found in Turkey. Since the patient was an inactive HBsAg carrier before his residence in Turkey, this case was regarded as an imported HBV genotype E case. In conclusion, detection of different HBV genotypes, their epidemiology and molecular characteristics are important for both national and global HBV surveillance and better clinical approach. "
6847,0.01,2.0000,"Children and adolescents are at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Transmission occurs through perinatal exposures, injecting drug use, consensual and nonconsensual sex, needle-stick and sharp injuries, and possibly some unusual contacts. Youth engaging in high-risk sexual activities are especially endangered. Half of the estimated worldwide 5.3 million new HIV infections occur in adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24. Of 20 000 known new adult and adolescent cases in the United States, 25% involve 13- to 21-year-olds. More than 1.4 million children worldwide (aged 15 and younger) are believed to be infected, and >1640 new cases are diagnosed daily. Of the 432 000 people reported to be living with HIV or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States, 5575 are children under 13. HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a form of secondary HIV prevention that may reduce the incidence of HIV infections. HIV PEP is commonly conceived of as 2 types: occupational and nonoccupational. Occupational HIV PEP is an accepted form of therapy for health care workers exposed to HIV through their jobs. A landmark study of healthcare workers concluded that occupational HIV PEP may be efficacious. Well-established US national guidelines for occupational HIV PEP exist for this at-risk population. Nonoccupational HIV PEP includes all other forms of HIV PEP, such as that given after sexual assault and consensual sex, injecting drug use, and needle-stick and sharp injuries in non-health care persons. Pediatric HIV PEP is typically the nonoccupational type. The efficacy of nonoccupational HIV PEP is unknown. The presumed efficacy is based on a collection of animal and human data concerning occupational, perinatal, and nonoccupational exposures to HIV. In contrast to occupational HIV PEP, there are no national US guidelines for nonoccupational HIV PEP, and few recommendations are available for its use for adolescents and children. Regardless of this absence, there is encouraging evidence supporting the value of HIV PEP in its various forms in pediatrics. Although unproven, the presumed mechanism for HIV PEP comes from animal and human work suggesting that shortly after an exposure to HIV, a window period exists during which the viral load is small enough to be controlled by the body's immune system. Antiretroviral medications given during this period may help to diminish or end viral replication, thereby reducing the viral inoculum to a more potentially manageable target for the host's defenses. HIV PEP is accepted practice in the perinatal setting and for health care workers with occupational injuries. The medical literature supports prescribing HIV PEP after community needle-stick and sharp injuries and after sexual assault from sources known or likely to be HIV-infected. HIV PEP after consensual unprotected intercourse between HIV sero-opposite partners has had growing use in the adult population, and can probably be utilized for children and adolescents. There is less documented experience and support for HIV PEP after consensual unprotected intercourse between partners of unknown HIV status, after prolonged or multiple episodes of sexual abuse from an assailant of unknown HIV status, after bites, and after the sharing of personal hygiene items or exposure to wounds of HIV-infected individuals. There are no formal guidelines for HIV PEP in adolescents and children. A few groups have commented on its provision in pediatrics, and some preliminary studies have been released. Our article provides a discussion of the data available on HIV transmission and HIV PEP in pediatrics. In our article, we propose an HIV PEP approach for adolescents and children. We recommend a stratified regimen, based on the work of Gerberding and Katz and other authors, that attempts to match seroconversion risk with an appropriate number of medications, while taking into account adverse side-effects and the amount of information that is typically available upon initial presentation. Twice daily regimens should be used when possible, and may improve compliance. HIV PEP should be administered within 1 hour of exposure. We strongly recommend that physicians trained in this form of therapy review the indications for HIV PEP within 72 hours of its provision. We advocate that due diligence in determining level of risk and appropriateness of drug selection be conducted as soon as possible after an exposure has occurred. When such information is not immediately available, we recommend the rapid treatment using the maximum level of care followed by careful investigation and reconsideration in follow-up or whenever possible. HIV PEP may be initiated provisionally after an exposure and then discontinued if the exposure source is confirmed to not be HIV-infected. In most cases, consultations with the experts in HIV care can occur after the rapid start of therapy. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"
149,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has infected an estimated 170 million people worldwide, most of whom are chronically infected (60% to 80%). In Italy, the estimate of anti-HCV antibody (Ab) prevalence, in the general population of Northern Italy, is 3.2%; in Central and Southern Italy, it is 8.4% to 22.4%. Highest prevalence of infection (70% to 90%) is found among intravenous drug users. Our purpose is to monitor HCV infection among drug users treated in a Drug Addiction Centre (Ser.T) in Naples and to gain a better understanding of that relationship with the abused substance(s). Epidemiological data are shown for viral coinfections. Finally, the authors investigate access to specific HCV therapy in an Italian Ser.T. The study analyzed a group of 1753 consecutive subjects treated from 1988 to 2008 in the O.U. Ser.T D.S.31 (Gesù e Maria Hospital), ASL Napoli 1 Centre. HCV Abs were detected by enzyme immune assay method and confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay III method. During the entire period, we performed real-time polymerase chain reaction at random for 312 patients. The incidence (per year) of HCV infection showed a rapid spread decrease from 49.5% in 2003 to 14.5% in 2008. The overall prevalence of HCV was 48.1%. We tested 312 randomly selected patients for viral replication. Our study showed active viral replication in 201 (64.4%) patients as follows: 97 of 201 (31.1%) resulted infected by genotype (gt) 1; 3 of 201 (1.0%) gt 2; 84 of 201 (26.9%) gt 3; and 4 of 201 (1.3%) gt 4. Coinfection data showed that HCV Ab prevalence was 58.5% (48 of 82) in hepatitis B virus chronically infected patients. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfection resulted in 95.2% (80 of 84) HIV patients. The prevalence of HIV Abs in HCV-infected patients was 8.99% (80 of 889). Analysis of drug abuse showed high prevalence of opiate addicted, multiabusers, and with high-risk factors. Cocaine abuser prevalence was 14.4%, and incidence, during past 4 years of the study, rose to 42.6%. Alcohol abuser prevalence represented 5.8% of patients and incidence rose to 17.7% in final 4 years of the study. In those opiate addicted, HCV infection was 61.0% (805 of 1320). HCV infection in cocaine-addicted patients was 9.5% (24 of 253). In 78 delta-9-tetra-hydro-cannabinol addicted patients, 5.1% of tests were positive (4 of 78). In alcohol abusers, HCV infection was 9.8% (10 of 102). Access to HCV treatment in our cohort from 2000 to 2008 resulted low (15.4%). Enhancing the Ser.Ts efficiency can result in health and financial benefits."
889,0.01,2.0000,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ genetic polymorphisms have been associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) outcomes. We aimed to determine impacts of HLA-DQ polymorphisms and their interactions with HBV mutations on the risks of liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). rs2856718 (A>G) and rs9275319 (A>G) were genotyped in 1342 healthy controls, 327 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance subjects, 611 asymptomatic HBsAg carriers (ASCs), 1144 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 734 LC patients, and 1531 HCC patients using quantitative PCR. HBV mutations were detected by direct sequencing. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to assess the factors and/or multiplicative interactions significantly associated with liver diseases. rs9275319 variant genotypes were inversely associated with HBV persistence compared to HBV natural clearance subjects. rs2856718 variant genotypes significantly increased LC risk compared to ASCs plus CHB patients (GG vs. AA: odds ratio [OR], 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.97 and AG+GG vs. AA: OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04-1.54) and decreased HCC risk compared to HCC-free HBV-infected subjects (AG vs. AA: OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.89 and AG+GG vs. AA: OR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.68-0.90). rs2856718 variant genotypes were significantly associated with an increased frequency of HBV A1726C mutation, a LC-risk, HCC-protective mutation, in genotype C. A rs9275319 variant genotype (GG) was significantly associated with an increased frequency of preS1 start codon mutation, an HCC-risk mutation, in genotype C. The interaction of rs2856718 AG+GG genotype with T1753V, a HCC-risk mutation, significantly reduced LC risk, with an OR of 0.26 (95% CI, 0.09-0.78); whereas the interaction of rs2856718 AG genotype with C1673T, a LC-risk mutation, significantly increased HCC risk, with an OR of 2.80 (95% CI, 1.02-7.66) in genotype C HBV-infected subjects. Conclusively, the HLA-DQ polymorphisms affect the risks of LC and HCC differently in chronic HBV-infected subjects, possibly via interacting with the HBV mutations. "
5526,0.01,2.0000,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), it remains unclear whether human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected injection drug users (IDUs) have durations of survival similar to those for comparable HIV-uninfected IDUs. The goal of this study was to compare survival durations of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected IDUs for the period 1987-2004.Methods. Demographic data, drug use characteristics, and biological markers were obtained at the time of admission to a substance abuse treatment program. The outcome of interest was the duration of survival after admission, and the primary exposure was HIV infection. Vital status was ascertained by means of the mortality register by the end of 2004. Three calendar periods, which were defined on the basis of use of specific therapies, were considered: 1987-1991 (the antiretroviral monotherapy era), 1992-1996 (the dual combination therapy era and the era when methadone was introduced in Spain), and 1997-2004 (the era of HAART and of established methadone programs). We used Cox regression methods allowing for late entries to handle the contribution of persons who survived a given period and entered the following period with nonzero time. We compared HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected IDUs with adjustments for age, sex, and duration of follow-up after admission."
3009,0.01,2.0000,"Viral replication of HIV-1 in the human body is a dynamic process. Incomplete suppression of replication during antiretroviral therapy ultimately selects for resistance that imparts an adaptive advantage to HIV-1. Therefore, the goal of antiretroviral therapy is complete suppression of viral replication. Viral suppression to below the lowest possible limits of detection has been associated with an optimal clinical response and delay of drug resistance. An ultrasensitive viral load assay with a very low threshold of detection remains our best laboratory tool to monitor the response to therapy. Patients may fail HAART for many reasons. Only when other potential causes of treatment failure are excluded should antiretroviral resistance testing be considered. Genotypic and phenotypic assays for assessing resistance are now available, and recent retrospective and prospective data support their use in clinical management as an adjunct to helping to choose among different antiretroviral drugs. Despite the growing enthusiasm for these tests, improvements in sensitivity, turnaround time, and quality control are still needed. A practitioner's decision about when to initiate or change therapy in an HIV-infected patient should depend primarily on viral load results, and not on antiretroviral resistance test results. Moreover, resistance testing is no substitute for a thorough clinical and drug history. As we approach the third decade of the HIV epidemic, we will learn how to use antiretroviral resistance tests in conjunction with (not in lieu of) proven clinical and laboratory tools."
1264,0.01,2.0000,"A 5-month-old white girl having persistent oral candidiasis was brought to medical attention because of acute respiratory distress, pneumonia, and hypoxia that worsened despite supportive care and antibiotics. Bronchial lavage fluid yielded Pneumocystis carinii. The diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was suspected, although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot tests were both negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Immunologic evaluation included the following results: a low normal CD4/CD8 ratio 0.88, CD4 lymphocytes 493/microL, and elevated IgA 539 mg/dL and IgM 175 mg/dL with normal IgG 492 mg/dL. Lymphocyte stimulation study results were depressed. Lymphocytes sent for culture were subsequently positive for HIV. The mother was HIV antibody positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot but belonged to no high-risk group and was asymptomatic except for chronic diarrhea. The father was HIV antibody negative. The patient was treated with pentamidine and IV gamma-globulin with good clinical response and a rapid decrease of IgM and IgA toward normal values. Subsequent candidal pneumonia and candidal esophagitis were treated successfully with amphotericin B. The patient has received prophylactic IV gamma-globulin infusions for 6 months and remains HIV negative by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. This case of pediatric AIDS highlights the need to consider HIV infection in the differential diagnosis of any child with physical findings or illnesses suggestive of AIDS-related complex or AIDS, even when HIV serologic findings are negative and parents belong to no high-risk group. Parental testing for HIV antibody is suggested in such cases."
8513,0.01,2.0000,"Despite the use of laboratory markers in estimating HIV prognosis, significant variation in the natural history of HIV-1 infection remains unexplained. Recent studies suggest psychosocial risk factors have important prognostic significance in HIV disease. The objective of the present study was to examine the prognostic influence of age, general intellectual functioning, and emotional distress across the spectrum of HIV disease progression. The study sample was drawn from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a 13-year, prospective study of HIV-seropositive men recruited from four study centers across the country. The participants were 1,231 HIV-seropositive MACS participants, followed from baseline (median 8/15/87) to the end of the observation period (12/15/98). HIV disease progression was evaluated with respect to three outcome measures: (1) number of years from baseline testing to the first AIDS defining illness (progression to AIDS), (2) years from baseline to HIV-dementia (progression to dementia), and (3) years from baseline to death (survival). The influence of psychosocial risk factors on outcome measures was evaluated using survival analyses. General intellectual functioning, age, and somatic symptoms of depression, were found to be significant predictors of HIV disease progression and survival. Older age at baseline was associated with a more rapid progression to dementia and death. Lower Shipley IQ estimates were associated with a more rapid disease progression (AIDS and dementia) and shortened survival. Somatic symptoms of depression were associated with shortened survival. In addition, age, IQ, and somatic symptoms of depression, had an additive effect with an increase in the number of risk factors associated with accelerated disease progression and shortened time to death. These findings remained consistent, despite controlling for baseline CD4 and HIV medication use. Psychosocial cofactors are important in understanding HIV disease progression. Methods for estimating HIV prognosis may become more reliable if psychosocial factors are considered. Future research will clarify if psychosocial risk factors reflect central nervous system integrity, brain reserve capacity or mediate morbidity and mortality through social economic status, access to health care and other social correlates."
4846,0.01,2.0000,"A retrospective study of 144 adults with HIV infection was conducted to investigate the prevalence of upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URTIs and LRTIs). The patients were divided into two groups: those with acquired HIV through intravenous drug abuse (IVDA), and those who had acquired HIV through 'other' risk behaviours. LRTIs were more prevalent than URTIs overall, and LRTIs were significantly more common (p < 0.001) in IVDAs than in the other-risk group. Tuberculosis (40%) and bacterial pneumonias (33%) comprised the majority of LRTIs among IVDAs, while Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (40%) was the commonest LRTI in the other-risk group. Analysis of CD4 T-lymphocyte counts indicated that HIV-seropositive IVDAs are at greater risk of developing chest infections at higher CD4 counts than other-risk patients. The IVDAs were also found to have a much higher rate of co-infection with hepatitis C and B, which may be a factor accelerating the progression from HIV infection to AIDS. The mean time averaged for the two groups from known seroconversion to development of respiratory tract infection is only 1.37 years, which suggests HIV-infected patients are presenting late for treatment in Malaysia."
1872,0.01,2.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy for HIV may have important economic benefits for patients and their households. We quantified the impact of HIV treatment on employment status among HIV patients in rural South Africa who were enrolled in a public-sector HIV treatment program supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. We linked clinical data from more than 2,000 patients in the treatment program with ten years of longitudinal socioeconomic data from a complete community-based population cohort of more than 30,000 adults residing in the clinical catchment area. We estimated the employment effects of HIV treatment in fixed-effects regressions. Four years after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, employment among HIV patients had recovered to about 90 percent of baseline rates observed in the same patients three to five years before they started treatment. Many patients initiated treatment early enough that they were able to avoid any loss of employment due to HIV. These results represent the first estimates of employment recovery among HIV patients in a general population, relative to the employment levels that these patients had prior to job-threatening HIV illness and the decision to seek care. There are large economic benefits to HIV treatment. For some patients, further gains could be obtained from initiating antiretroviral therapy earlier, prior to HIV-related job loss."
4712,0.01,2.0000,"A number of factors, including increased iron stores and alcohol consumption, are known to be associated with the development of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) in susceptible individuals. Recent reports have described a significant association between inheritance of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene, associated with genetic hemochromatosis (GH) and PCT. A strong association between hepatitis C virus infection and PCT has also been demonstrated, while case reports record a link between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and PCT. We have investigated the frequency of these factors in a racially-mixed population of patients with PCT in Cape Town, South Africa. 57 patients with PCT drawn from three ethnic groups were screened for the presence of the C282Y and H63D mutations linked to GH, and the prevalences were compared with corresponding healthy control populations. The seroprevalence of markers for HCV, hepatitis B (HBV) and HIV infection were examined in 28 of these. In the control populations, we found that both the C282Y and H63D mutations are highly prevalent in South Africans of European origin. In a population of mixed or Asian origin, the C282Y mutation is very rare whereas the H63D mutation is common. Neither mutation was encountered in any African subject. Both mutations are associated with PCT, but the association is dependent on the ethnic origins of the population to which the patient belongs. In contrast to other studies, HCV infection is numerically unimportant in PCT in our patients. HIV infection is increasingly encountered in our patients with PCT, but the strength of the association cannot be determined in view of the high background prevalence of HIV infection in some sectors of the South African population. The contribution of specific risk factors may be heavily dependent on the population from which patients are drawn, and care should be taken in extrapolating from observations in one racial or geographic population to any other."
3384,0.01,2.0000,"An unusual hepatitis B virus (HBV) variant, assigned provisionally to genotype I, was recently reported, characterized by an anomalous genotyping pattern and putative recombination; however, the natural history of this unusual strain is unknown. This study analyzed longitudinal sera collected over a 9-year period from a patient infected with this variant to investigate the clinical profile and intrahost viral evolution over time. The patient, who had immigrated to Canada in 1998 from Vietnam, was treated with lamivudine in 2000. Approximately 4-5 years following the withdrawal of lamivudine therapy, a genomic ""shift"" occurred coincident with ALT flares and increasing HBV viral load, resulting in numerous stable nucleotide substitutions within the core coding region, suggesting altered immune control that may provide a selective advantage to the virus. Analysis of quasispecies diversity over time demonstrated further this shift, with two sequence clusters associated with time points either prior to or following relapse observed, including increased diversity among quasispecies prior to relapse. In keeping with the complex nature of genotype I strains, majority population genomes had a mean genetic distance from genotype C of 7.6 +/- 0.1%, although large genomic segments lacked significant homology with any HBV genotype. Further study is needed to understand the evolutionary origin and natural history of infection with this unique HBV variant."
6241,0.01,2.0000,"The recent availability of CCR5 antagonists as anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) therapeutics has highlighted the need to accurately identify CXCR4-using variants in patient samples when use of this new drug class is considered. The Trofile assay (Monogram Biosciences) has become the method that is the most widely used to define tropism in the clinic prior to the use of a CCR5 antagonist. By comparison, the MT-2 assay has been used since early in the HIV epidemic to define tropism in clinical specimens. Given that there are few data from direct comparisons of these two assays, we evaluated the performance of the plasma-based Trofile assay and the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based MT-2 assay for the detection of CXCR4 use in defining the tropism of HIV isolates derived from clinical samples. The various samples used for this comparison were derived from participants of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV infection and AIDS who underwent consecutive MT-2 assay testing of their PBMCs at approximately 3-month intervals. This unique sample set was specifically selected because consecutive MT-2 assays had demonstrated a shift from negative to positive in PBMCs, reflecting the first emergence of CXCR4-using virus in PBMCs above the level of detection of the assay in these individuals. Trofile testing was performed with clonal HIV type 1 (HIV-1) variants (n = 21), MT-2 cell culture-derived cells (n = 20) and supernatants (n = 42), and plasma samples (n = 76). Among the clonal HIV-1 variants and MT-2 cell culture-derived samples, the results of the Trofile and MT-2 assays demonstrated a high degree of concordance (95% to 98%). Among consecutive plasma samples, detection of CXCR4-using virus was at or before the time of first detection by the MT-2 assay in 5/10 patients by the original Trofile assay and in 9/10 patients by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay. Differences in the time to the first detection of CXCR4 use between the MT-2 assay (PBMCs) and the original Trofile assay (plasma) were greatly reduced by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay, suggesting that sensitivity for the detection of minor CXCR4-using variants may be a more important determinant of discordant findings than compartmentalization. The similarities in performance of the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile and MT-2 assays suggest that either may be an appropriate methodology to define tropism in patient specimens."
7054,0.01,2.0000,"Few data are available about the treatment of chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV-infected persons with active drug or alcohol addiction and psychiatric disorders. We report the case of a 42-year-old man who entered care with a CD4+ cell count of 78/microL but was reluctant to take many of the available antiretroviral agents. For many years, periods of sobriety and good adherence to antiretroviral medications were interspersed with relapses to heroin, cocaine, and alcohol use as well as episodes of overdose, major depression with psychiatric hospitalization, incarceration, and discontinuation of antiretroviral medications. After 4 years of HIV primary care, the patient was stabilized to begin therapy for hepatitis C with pegylated interferon and ribavirin with the support of a multidisciplinary team. After starting treatment for hepatitis C, the patient achieved an early virologic response and continues to have an undetectable HCV RNA level by polymerase chain reaction testing and 100% adherence to on-site pegylated interferon injections, without adverse events related to his addiction or psychiatric symptoms. This case suggests that HIV-HCV-coinfected persons with the common comorbidities of polysubstance dependence and psychiatric illness may effectively and safely undergo pharmacotherapy for hepatitis C with appropriate support."
5370,0.01,2.0000,"Evaluation of drug resistance by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genotyping has proven to be useful for the selection of drug combinations with maximum antiretroviral activity. We compared three genotyping methods for identification of mutations known to confer drug resistance in the reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes of HIV type 1 (HIV-1). The HIV-GenotypR method (GenotypR; Specialty Laboratories, Inc., Santa Monica, Calif.) with the ABI 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.), the HIV PRT GeneChip assay (GeneChip; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif.), and the HIV-1 RT Line Probe Assay (LiPA; Innogenetics, Alpharetta, Ga.) were used to genotype plasma samples from HIV-infected patients attending the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics and the Mayo Clinic. At the time of analysis, patients were failing combination therapy (n = 18) or were treatment naive (n = 6). Forty codons of the RT and protease genes were analyzed by GenotypR and GeneChip for resistance-associated mutations. LiPA analyzed seven RT codons for mutations. Each sample was genotyped by all three assays, and each assay was subjected to pairwise comparisons. At least 92% of the codons tested (by the three assays) in paired comparisons were concordant. GenotypR and GeneChip demonstrated 96.6% concordance over the 40 codons tested. GenotypR identified slightly more mutations than GeneChip and LiPA; GeneChip identified all primary mutations that corresponded to failing treatment regimens. Each assay identified at least 84% of the mutations identified by the other assays. Mutations that were discordant between the assays mainly comprised secondary mutations and natural polymorphisms. The assays had better concordance for mutations that corresponded to current failing regimens, present in the more predominant viral quasispecies. In the treatment-naive patients, GenotypR, GeneChip, and LiPA mainly identified wild-type virus. Only the LiPA identified K70R, a possible transmitted zidovudine resistance mutation, in the RT gene of a treatment-naive patient. We conclude that although discrepancies in results exist between assays, each assay showed a similar capacity to identify potentially clinically relevant mutations related to patient treatment regimens."
5542,0.01,2.0000,"Introduction of antiretroviral combination therapy has profoundly altered both the course and prognosis of the disease in HIV-infected persons. Indeed, protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral combination therapy dramatically decreased morbidity and mortality and improved quality of life of HIV-infected persons. Recent data, however, have raised concerns that antiretroviral combination therapy is associated with premature manifestation of coronary artery disease. In particular, protease inhibitors have been linked to metabolic changes such as insulin resistance, abnormalities in lipid metabolism and lipodystrophy and increased coronary artery calcification. Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions whether the incidence of myocardial infarction is indeed increased in this patient population. The most substantial database has recently been provided by the D:A:D study group who demonstrated an increased incidence of myocardial infarction in HIV-infected persons on protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-containing therapy in a prospective observational cohort study. Much about the mechanisms involved leading to this finding remain elusive. Surrogate markers such as endothelial function may help to delineate potential mechanisms. Endothelial dysfunction is a key event in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease. It is characterized by decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Furthermore endothelial ""activation"" leading to a pro-inflammatory, proliferative and prothrombotic state of the endothelium occurs. The observed accelerated atherosclerosis could either be caused by the virus infection itself or by a side effect of antiretroviral therapy, protease inhibitors in particular. Experimental studies demonstrate a direct impact of viral components (gp120, TAT) on the endothelium, as they lead to expression of adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM], E-selectin), a prothrombotic state (increase of von Willebrand factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-[PAI-]1, tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA], tissue factor). In addition, soluble adhesion molecules (sE-selectin, ICAM) were found to be increased in HIV-infected persons. Impaired flow-mediated dilation can already be detected in HIV-infected children, independent of antiretroviral therapy. Another study showed a correlation between viral load and flow-mediated dilation, supporting the notion of infection/inflammation as a contributor to endothelial dysfunction. The influence of protease inhibitor therapy on the endothelium was investigated in several studies in vitro and in vivo. In experimental studies certain protease inhibitors downregulated eNOS expression, and induced CD36 scavenger receptor expression. Furthermore, apoptosis, radical oxygen species (ROS), proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelin-1 were found to be increased. There is conflicting evidence about adhesion molecules, as some investigators detected a decrease by therapy, others did not see an effect. In clinical studies all but one investigator found endothelial function to be impaired in HIV-infected persons on protease inhibitor-containing regimens. An important study to underline the hypothesis of a link between protease inhibitor therapy comes from Dubé et al. showing that in healthy volunteers, indinavir caused impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation after 4 weeks. In a wide variety of clinical conditions lipid-lowering therapy using statins has shown to improve endothelial function as well as hard clinical endpoints. Drug interactions caused by common metabolism of protease inhibitors and most statins by the P450 3A4 pathway limit the use of these drugs it this setting. Pravastatin, which is being metabolized independently of P450 enzymes, was tested in several studies. In one study a trend toward improvement of endothelial function was observed. In an own similar study the authors recently provided evidence of a significant improvement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in 30 HIV-infected persons. These studies support current guidelines of treating protease inhibitor-associated dyslipidemia with statins, preferably pravastatin.. Many questions remain unanswered in the context of antiretroviral therapy and cardiovascular risk. Results gained from research of endothelial function have served to delineate certain potential mechanisms, much work is yet to be done."
8228,0.01,2.0000,"The antiviral activity of a CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone (TCC108) directed against a newly identified HLA-B14-restricted epitope, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev(67-75) SAEPVPLQL, was analyzed with respect to its kinetics of target cell lysis and inhibition of HIV-1 production. Addition of TCC108 cells or CD8(+) reverse transcriptase-specific CTLs to HLA-matched CD4(+) T cells at different times after infection with HIV-1 IIIB showed that infected cells became susceptible to CTL-mediated lysis before peak virus production but after the onset of progeny virus release. When either of these CTLs were added to part of the infected cells immediately after infection, p55 expression and virus production were significantly suppressed. These data support a model in which CTLs, apart from exerting cytolytic activity which may prevent continued virus release, can interfere with viral protein expression during the eclipse phase via noncytolytic mechanisms. TCC108-mediated inhibition of virus replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells caused rapid selection of a virus with a mutation (69E-->K) in the Rev(67-75) CTL epitope which abolished recognition by TCC108 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that both cytolytic and noncytolytic antiviral mechanisms of CTLs can be specifically targeted to HIV-1-infected cells."
2952,0.01,2.0000,"Antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infected children. However, development of ARV resistance in these children is a major public health problem due to lack of availability of and access to new drugs. This study was conducted in order to identify circulating HIV subtypes and recombinant forms and evaluate the drug resistance mutation patterns in 18 HIV-1 infected children failing ARV treatment in Kelantan, Malaysia. Genotyping for codon 1-99 of protease (PR) and 1-250 of reverse transcriptase (RT) were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing. Subsequently, these were phylogenetically analyzed to determine the subtypes. CRF33_01B (44.4%) was found to be the predominant HIV subtype, followed by B (27.8%), CRF15_01B (16.7%) and CRF01_AE (11.1%) subtypes. The most prevalent RT mutations were T215F/V/Y (66.7%), D67G/N (55.6%), K219Q/E/R (44.4%), M184V/I (38.9%), K70R/E (27.8%) and M41L (27.8%), associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) resistance; and K103N (55.6%), G190A (33.3%), and K101P/E/H (27.8%) associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) resistance. The results showed a possible emergence of CRF33_01B as current predominant subtypes/circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), and a high frequency of primary mutations among HIV-1 infected children after failure of ARV therapy in Kelantan, Malaysia."
6331,0.01,2.0000,"There are few data on drug resistance-associated mutations in the former Soviet Union since, studies have usually been focused on the env or gag genes for subtype information. This study examines the prevalence and patterns of resistance-associated mutations to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors (RTI, PRI) in 278 HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve subjects from countries of Eastern Europe, and defines characteristic polymorphisms of RT and PR sequences in HIV-1 subtype A viruses. Blood samples were collected between 1997 and 2004. Plasma RNA was used for PR-RT amplification by reverse transcription coupled with nested PCR and sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis was done with neighbor-joining trees and bootscanning. Analysis of drug resistance mutations, with Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database's algorithm, resulted in an overall prevalence of 12.9% resistance to RTI and 3.9% to PRI. The most frequent substitutions in the RT region were at positions 62 and 236. V77I substitution in PR was found in 47.8% of samples. Polymorphisms in subtype A sequences were identified. This is the first study reporting the prevalence and patterns of both PRI and RTI resistance-associated mutations in naïve HIV-1 infected patients from the former Soviet Union. These data underline the importance of genotypic resistance testing of chronically HIV-1-infected patients before initiating treatment, in order to select the most suitable drug regimen."
2810,0.01,2.0000,"Several reports show that the prevalence of HBV (hepatitis B virus) carriers in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infected populations is significantly higher than in HIV seronegative individuals, independent of the risk group for HIV, that is, homosexuals or drug abusers. In this context, evaluation of the simultaneous presence of HBV and HIV in PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) is of particular interest for at least 2 reasons: 1) the possible reciprocal influence of the 2 viruses when they infect the same cell; 2) the possibility that HIV-induced hematological disorders could indirectly influence the settling of HBV in blood cell populations. We report data on the frequency of PCR positivity for HBV DNA in PBMCs from 62 HIV infected patients, rigorously selected by risk group, that is, intravenous use of heroin for at least 3 years and syringe promiscuity. Sixty-seven HIV negative individuals who never used any drug formed the control group. The analysis of the cases positive for HBV DNA in PBMCs showed that: 1) the overall prevalence of PCR positivity found in HIV infected patients was significantly lower than that registered in the control group; 2) PCR positivity among the subjects who were HBsAg negative and anti-HBV positive was extremely low in the HIV infected patients (3.7%) but quite frequent in the HIV negative subjects (37.0%). The results support the hypothesis that, unlike the HIV negative individuals, our HIV infected patients exhibited HBV DNA in PBMCS almost exclusively when they presented with active HBV replication."
2336,0.01,2.0000,"Recently, hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and mutations have been reported to be related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This cross-sectional case-control study examined the relationship between HCC and mutations in the enhancer II/core promoter and precore regions of HBV by comparing 135 Korean HCC patients infected with HBV genotype C2 (HBV/C2; HCC group) with 135 age-, sex-, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status-matched patients without HCC (non- HCC group). Age and sex were also matched between HBeAg-positive and -negative patients. The prevalence of T1653, A1689, V1753, T1762/A1764, T1846, A1850, C1858, and A1896 mutations was evaluated in this population. The prevalence of the T1653 mutation in the box alpha region, the T1689 [corrected] mutation in between the box alpha and beta regions, and the T1762/A1764 mutations in the basal core promoter region was significantly higher in the HCC group compared to the non-HCC group (8.9% vs. 2.2%, P = 0.017; 19.3% vs. 4.4%, P < 0.001; and 60.7% vs. 22.2%; P < 0.001). Among HBeAg-negative patients, the frequency of the T1653 mutation was higher in the HCC group. Regardless of HBeAg status, the prevalence of the T1689, [corrected] and T1762/A1764 mutations was higher in the HCC group than in the non-HCC group. However, no association was observed between mutations in the precore region and HCC. Upon multivariate analysis, the presence of the T1653, T1689, [corrected] and T1762/A1764 mutations was an independent predictive factor for HCC. The addition of the T1653 or T1689 [corrected] mutation to T1762/A1764 increased the risk of HCC. In conclusion, the T1653, T1689, [corrected] and/or T1762/A1764 mutations were associated with the development of HCC in Korean patients infected with HBV/C2."
3911,0.01,2.0000,"The simultaneous presence of multiple HIV-1 subtypes has become common in communities with the growth of the pandemic. As a consequence, the potentiality for an increased frequency of HIV-1 mixed infections caused by viruses of distinct subtypes could be expected. Thus, there is a need to estimate the prevalence and geographic distribution of infections caused by viruses of a singular subtype as well as coinfections caused by two or more HIV-1 strains of distinct subtypes. To address this need, we have developed a genetic method based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to screen for these two types of infections within infected populations. In this assay, restriction enzymes may be used to predict the phylogroup of HIV-1 infected samples. A 297 bp pol fragment spanning the entire viral protease gene and a 311 bp fragment of the p24 gag region are used for this analysis. The viral regions are amplified by nested PCR using DNA templates from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or virus culture. Classification of HIV-1 strains to well defined subtypes B, D, F, and A/C is done by sequential endonuclease restriction analysis of a PCR amplified-protease gene followed by analysis of the p24 gag region. The electrophoretic migration patterns visualized by ethidium bromide staining or by radiolabeled probes are then determined on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. In infections caused by viruses of a singular subtype, a single restriction pattern is detected, whereas in multiple infections caused by two or more viral strains of different subtypes, the combination of different digestion patterns are observed in infected individuals. Using this methodology we have screened for genetic variations in HIV-1 proviral DNA from thirty-three Brazilian samples. Our RFLP procedure classified thirty-two samples as single infections caused by viruses of subtypes B (31) and F (1), and one sample as dual infection caused by distinct viral strains. Subsequent sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the viral protease gene in lymphocytes of all these patients confirmed our RFLP findings in single infections, and demonstrated the existence of two distinct HIV-1 strains of subtypes F and D in a patient which lymphocytes showed the simultaneous presence of two different digestion patterns. As up to now, single infections caused by subtype D variants were not identified in Brazil, our data provide the first evidence of subtype D HIV-1 in this country. Because sequencing of HIV proviral DNA is not particularly practical for large-scale molecular epidemiological studies, the protease/gag-based RFLP screening method will be useful to predict the phylogroup of HIV-1, and to identify multiple infections caused by HIV-1 strains of distinct subtypes. We believe that this information is crucial for both evaluation of the HIV-1/AIDS pandemic and intervention strategies."
4663,0.01,2.0000,"Most studies of the medical costs of HIV infection focus on the terminal stage of this chronic illness when the patients have developed AIDS or severe HIV disease and in-patient care dominates. Data are also needed on the medical costs during the prolonged phase of HIV infection preceding severe terminal illness and the effects it may have on the provision of outpatient care. The study population was derived from a cohort study of factory workers and their spouses in Tanzania. Morbidity and outpatient health services utilization are estimated for 1832 adults who on average had been enrolled for two years and utilized the study clinic. Among those who had been enrolled at least 2 years, 50 cases (HIV+ since enrollment) and 150 control (HIV- until last visit) were selected, matched by age, sex and income level to estimate expenditure on drugs by HIV status. There was an increase in morbidity during HIV infection: the incidence of clinical diagnoses was 30% higher among HIV-positive than among HIV-negative adults (p < 0.001). HIV-infected adults also made more frequent use of the outpatient services (23% higher utilization). Estimates of essential drug costs among the subsample showed a 15% increase for HIV infected adults compared to HIV-negative adults, caused by higher use of antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs. The overall increase in morbidity, outpatient care services utilization and essential drug use due to HIV infection was limited, as HIV prevalence in this adult population was 11%. For example, the net proportion of all illness episodes attributable to HIV infection was 3.2%. Possible biases are discussed and suggest that our findings are a minimum estimate of the effect of adult HIV infection on outpatient care costs. There is a need for more studies in different settings to assess the impact of HIV infection on outpatient care in developing countries."
8468,0.01,2.0000,"Recently, a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutant with HBe antigen-negative phenotype has been characterized, in which one TATA box-like motif of the precore/core promoter had degenerated: most frequently by both A-->T and G-->A mutations at positions 1762 and 1764, respectively. The clinical significance of this mutant is as yet unknown. In our present study, the T1762 A1764 mutant was sought in sera from HBV-infected blood donors and chronic liver disease patients by directly sequencing a PCR-amplified region of HBVDNA. Also, because the A1764 mutation generates a Sau3AI cleavage site (GGTC-->GATC), we digested the PCR products with Sau3AI to see if cleavage would occur at this specific site. Our results mostly corroborated the earlier report but we found a higher-than-predicted frequency of HBe antigen-positive blood donors positive for the mutant (22%). The titres of HBe antigen in these mutant-positive sera were slightly decreased compared to the titres in wild-type HBV infection. In addition, these blood donors had relatively high (though within the normal range) serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, suggesting that the T1762 A1764 mutation could be used as a sensitive laboratory marker for insidious hepatitis in these otherwise 'asymptomatic' carriers. The Sau3AI assay, which is much more convenient than sequencing, was shown to be useful for the detection of the T1762 A1764 mutant in an extensive number of clinical samples."
717,0.01,2.0000,"The emerging presence of hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection in the United States has been the focus of much attention among health care providers and the general population. Among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there has been a dramatic increase in hepatitis C disease. During the 1980s and early 1990s, hepatitis C was viewed as a disease for which little could be done, both because of ineffective treatment and the severity and lack of adequate treatments for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) itself. Treatment with interferon had poor effect on hepatitis C in the co-infected population, especially for those with advanced immunosuppression. The regimen was difficult to tolerate even with dose reductions. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and effective treatment and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, a substantial portion of HIV-infected patients are living long enough to have their health compromised by hepatic failure or hepatocellular carcinoma owing to hepatitis C, rather than by AIDS-related illness. New treatments are available for hepatitis C, with preliminary research yielding promising results. The role of these medications in managing HIV/HCV co-infection is currently under study, with implications for many. Health care providers are increasingly faced with the challenges of caring for people infected with the hepatitis C virus, and the growing number of individuals co-infected with hepatitis C and HIV. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of hepatitis C, especially in the presence of HIV infection, and to detail the recognition and management of the care of this emerging population."

External quality control tools are crucial to ensure the accuracy of the results obtained by microbiology laboratories. This article summarizes the results of the 2011 SEIMC External Quality Control Program for HIV-1, HCV, and HBV viral loads. In the HIV-1 program, a total of five standards were sent. One standard consisted of seronegative human plasma, while the remaining four contained plasma from three different viremic patients in the range of 2-5 log10 copies/mL; to determine repeatability, two of these standards were identical. A significant proportion of the laboratories (52.1% on average) obtained values outside the accepted range (mean ± 0,25 log10 copies/mL), depending on the standard and on the method used for quantification. Repeatability was very good, with up to 94.9% of laboratories reporting results within the accepted range (Δ<0,5 log10 copies/ mL). The HBV and HCV program consisted of two standards with different viral load contents. In most of the participating laboratories (90% in the case of HCV and 86% in that of HBV), all the results were within the accepted range (mean ± 1.96 SD log10UI/mL). Data from this analysis reinforce the utility of proficiency programs to ensure the quality of the results obtained by a particular laboratory, as well as the importance of the post-analytical phase in overall quality. Due to the marked interlaboratory variability found, use of the same method and the same laboratory for patient follow-up is advisable."

169,0.01,2.0000,"GB virus C (GBV-C) infection is frequent in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) due to similar transmission routes of these viruses. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of infection and genotypic characteristics of GBV-C in this population. The presence of GBV-C RNA was determined in serum samples of 106 patients infected with HIV by reverse transcriptase-nested polymerase chain reaction. GBV-C genotypes were determined by direct sequencing. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, HIV viral load and CD4(+) count were also tested in all patients. The overall prevalence of GBV-C infection was 11.3% in HIV patients. There was no significant difference between patients with and without GBV-C infection regarding age, sex, route of transmission, viral load, ALT levels, HBV and HCV co-infection and treatment with antiretroviral drugs. 66.7% of patients with GBV-C had a CD4(+) count > or = 200 and 33.3% had a CD4(+) count < 200 cells/mm(3). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all GBV-C isolates were genotype 2, and classified as subtype 2a. GBV-C infection is relatively common in patients infected with HIV. The prevailing GBV-C genotype 2a in this study group concurred with reports from other parts of the Middle East."
2973,0.01,2.0000,"End-stage renal disease patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients are at risk for both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and they may coexist. To determine the prevalence and clinical impact of HBV and HCV infection, we studied poly chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR on the blood samples of 90 HD patients in Kerman, Iran. ELISA test was used to detect anti-HBc, anti-HBs and HBsAg. We found that 30 out of 90 (33.3%) patients were PCR-RT-PCR positive for HCV-RNA. No HBV-DNA (0%) was detected through the PCR study in both positive and negative HCV-RNA patient groups. Though none of the samples was HBsAg positive, 10 (33.3%) HCV-RNA positive patients were anti-HBc positive, and 12 (40.7%) were anti-HBs positive. We conclude that prevalence of hepatitis C infection is high in HD patients in our region, but not associated with active HBV infection."
8738,0.01,2.0000,"The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of infections with hepatotrophic viruses in an anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive population from Buenos Aires and to compare it among the main risk groups for HIV infection. Four hundred and eighty-four consecutive patients attending the HIV outpatients clinic were studied: 359 men and 125 women, median age 29 years (range 16-67 years); 35.5% had presented acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining conditions. Two hundred and thirty-four patients were intravenous drug users (IVDU), 99 had homosexual and 142 heterosexual preference, seven had received blood transfusions and two had no risk factors. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb) and to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) were investigated in all patients; antibodies to HBsAg (HBsAb) and IgG antibodies to hepatitis D virus (anti-HDV) in all HBcAb-positive patients; hepatitis B e antigen and antibodies to HBeAg (HBeAg) in all HBsAg-positive patients; IgG antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) in the first 307 patients; and IgG antibodies to hepatitis E virus (anti-HEV) in the first 91 patients. As control groups, contemporary voluntary blood donors were studied for prevalence of HAV, HBV, HCV and HEV. The percentages of HBcAb, HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HEV (58.5, 14.5, 58.5 and 6.6%, respectively) were significantly higher in anti-HIV-positive patients than in control groups (3.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.8%, respectively) (P = 0.000). The prevalence of HBcAb was significantly higher in IVDU (72.6%) than in heterosexuals (33.8%) (P = 0.0001) and in homosexuals (59.6%) (P = 0.0189). The percentage of HBsAg was significantly higher in IVDU (19.2%) than in heterosexuals (6.3%) (P = 0.0004). Anti-HCV was significantly higher in IVDU (92.3%) than in homosexuals (14.1%) and in heterosexuals (33.1%) (P = 0.000 in both cases). The prevalence of anti-HDV was relatively low (1.9%). There was no difference in the percentage of anti-HAV between HIV-positive and negative subjects. In conclusion, there is a high prevalence of HBV and HCV infections in HIV-positive patients from our area. Drug use is the main route of transmission, but prevalence of HCV in patients with, probably, sexually acquired HIV infection is also higher than in the control group. The increased prevalence of HEV infection in HIV-positive individuals is another provocative finding that warrants further study."
9923,0.01,2.0000,"The recent expansion of antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage in middle/low-income countries has been associated with increasing prevalence of HIV pre-ART drug resistance (PDR). We assessed PDR prevalence, patterns, and trends in Guatemala. Blood samples from 1,084 ART-naive individuals, enrolled from October 2010 to December 2013 at the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala City, were obtained. PDR was evaluated using the WHO mutation list for transmitted drug resistance (TDR) surveillance. An overall PDR prevalence of 7.3% (95% CI 5.8-9.0%) was observed for the whole study period. TDR to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) was the highest (4.9%, p<0.001), followed by nucleoside RT inhibitors (1.8%) and protease inhibitors (1.0%). No significant trends in PDR prevalence were observed during the study period. However, higher NNRTI PDR levels were found in individuals with >500 and 350-500 CD4(+) T cells/μl (7.4% and 8.7%, respectively) compared to individuals with <350 CD4(+) T cells/μl (3.7%; p=0.039 and p=0.007, respectively), as well as a tendency of higher levels of NNRTI transmitted drug resistance (DR) in individuals with recent infection determined by HIV incidence tests (9.7%), suggesting increasing trends in time. Clusters of viruses with NNRTI PDR suggesting complex transmission networks were observed. No associations between PDR and demographic variables were found. PDR in Guatemala remains at an intermediate level. Nevertheless, we have shown evidence suggesting increasing trends in NNRTI PDR, which need to be taken into account in national HIV management policies."
6386,0.01,2.0000,"The aim of this study was to evaluate quality of life (QOL) and analyze its determinants among Cambodian adults living with HIV/AIDS who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART). A cross-sectional study was conducted using convenience sampling to select 150 adults 18 years of age or older from the patient population at the HIV/AIDS care hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. QOL was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life HIV BREF; socio-demographic characteristics, time elapsed since HIV diagnosis, months on ART, CD4 cell count, family and community support, depression, and anxiety were included in the survey. Results of the multiple regression analysis indicate that positive predictors of QOL included being female, being less 40 years old, having a household monthly income greater than 300 USD, having an education beyond the secondary level, or being employed. However, time elapsed since HIV diagnosis and duration of ART were not significantly associated with QOL and CD4 cell count and the World Health Organization clinical stage had little association with QOL. Perceiving oneself as healthy and happy and reporting no depression or anxiety were associated with a positive QOL. These findings suggest the importance of group-specific interventions to improve the QOL for those people living with HIV/AIDS in Cambodia who are male, have a low household income or education level, are unemployed, or are anxious or depressed."
2709,0.01,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B affects nearly 10% of HIV-infected patients. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a dynamic disease and coinfection with HIV impacts directly on the outcome of HBV infection, considerably complicating its natural history, diagnosis, and management. The aim of this study was to compare two cohorts of HBV monoinfected and HBV/HIV coinfected Iranian patients undergoing long-term lamivudine therapy from the clinical and virological aspects, as well as the frequency of detected mutations in HBV genome. To this end, HBV Pol/S regions from 72 patients were PCR-amplified and directly sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a 40-times higher risk of coinfection with ayw3 subtype of HBV genotype D rather than ayw2 subtype [P<0.001, odd: 40.66, CI: 95 % (4.69-352.23)]. While no resistance mutation was detected in HBV/HIV coinfected cohort, LAM-resistance mutations (rtM204I/V in YMDD and rtL180M in FLLA polymerase motifs) were identified in 30% (9 out of 30) and 16.66% (5 out of 30) of HBV monoinfected patients (P<0.05). Moreover, several mutations (sP105A, sI110S/L, sS136Y and sP127T/L) with significant differences in the frequency were identified in the S region of both cohorts. Finally, this study found strong correlation between the type of infection (mono or coinfection) and characteristics like patient gender, ALT levels, HBV-DNA levels and HBV subtypes. These results pointed to the importance of determination of HBV variants in the management of patients and suggested that in contrary to HBV monoinfections, LAM may be still an appropriate drug for the treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV coinfected patients; however, further studies to clarify the role of HIV in HBV LAM-resistance mutations are required."

A patient with known Crohn's disease, however, who was later infected with HIV, was reported to continue to have symptomatic Crohn's disease despite an eventual decrease in CD4 count to 84/mm3. We report the new onset of Crohn's disease in an HIV-infected patient with a CD4 count of 100/mm3. This report is the first to document the new onset of Crohn's disease in a patient with HIV and a CD4 count in the range commonly associated with various opportunistic infections and neoplasms. In addition, it is the first to confirm the recent finding that Crohn's disease may be active despite the profound immune deficiency associated with advanced HIV infection. Thus this report further challenges the significance of the CD4 cell in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease."

However, this phenomenon has not been investigated in clinical practice. To address this gap, data from patients starting a first-line lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/rtv)-based therapy with available baseline HIV-1 RNA load, a viral genotype and follow-up viral load after 3 and 6 months of treatment were extracted from the Italian Antiretroviral Resistance Cohort Analysis (ARCA) observational database. Based on survival analysis, 39 (7.1%) and 43 (7.8%) of the 548 examined patient cases had an HIV-1 RNA >500 and >50 copies/ml, respectively, after 6 months of treatment. Cox proportional hazard models detected baseline HIV-1 RNA (RH 1.79, 95%CI 1.10-2.92 per 1-log(10) increase, P=0.02) and resistance to the nucleoside backbone (RH 1.04, 95%CI 1.02-1.06 per 10-point increase using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm, P<0.001) as independent predictors of HIV-1 RNA at >500 copies/ml, but not at the >50 copies/ml cutoff criteria. Higher baseline viral load, older patient age, heterosexual route of infection and use of tenofovir/emtricitabine were predictors of failure at month 3 using the 50-copy and/or 500-copy threshold. Resistance to LPV/rtv did not occur or increase in any of the available 36 follow-up HIV-1 genotypes. Resistance to the nucleoside backbone (M184V) developed in four cases. Despite the likely differences in patient population and adherence, both the low rate of virological failure and the lack of development of LPV/rtv resistance documented in clinical trials are thus confirmed in clinical practice."

We analyzed data from the N2R study which was an open label, randomized, comparative trial comparing treatment outcomes between 71 TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients receiving efavirenz (EFV)-based and nevirapine (NVP)-based ART; all of whom were receiving RMP-containing anti-TB treatment. Demographic data, liver function test, CD4 cell count, plasma HIV-1 RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody were collected before initiating ART (week 0). Liver enzymes and total bilirubin levels were monitored at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after ART initiation. All patients were followed until TB therapy was completed. Of 142 patients, 8 patients were excluded. Among the remaining 134 patients, the mean+/-SD age was 36.8+/-8.6 years and 67.2% were male. Severe hepatotoxicity (grade 3 or 4) developed in 4 patients (2.9%); 3 patients (4.6%) in the NVP group and 1 patient (1.4%) in the EFV group. Severe hyperbilirubinemia (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 7 patients (5.2%); 5 patients (7.7%) in the NVP group and 2 patients (2.9%) in the EFV group. Grade 1 or 2 hepatotoxicity occurred in 34 patients (31.4%). Hepatitis C virus co-infection (adjusted OR 3.03; 95%CI 1.26-7.29) was an independent risk factor associated with grade 1-4 hepatotoxicity (p=0.013). Monitoring of hepatotoxicity should be considered in TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients who are infected with HCV and receiving NVP."
7701,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is the responsible agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a multi system disorder including the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is an immunological privileged site providing a sanctuary and reservoir for HIV-1. Monocytes derived macrophages (MDM) and microglia play a critical role in the development of HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Although the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a strong reduction of HAD incidence, the prevalence of minor HIV-1 associated cognitive impairment appears rising among AIDS patients. Various factors including toxicity, insurgence of drug resistance and sometimes limited access to HAART, contribute to this phenomenon. Independent evolution of drug resistance mutations in several areas of the CNS may emerge as consequence of incomplete suppression of HIV-1, probably related to poor penetration of antiretroviral drugs into CNS. The emergence of resistant virus in the CNS may considerable influence the outcome of neurological disease and also the reseeding of HIV-1 in the systemic circulation upon failure of therapy. In this review, we outline the current state of knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of CNS injury in HIV-1 infection and will focus on the effects of HAART on CNS."
5207,0.01,2.0000,"The genetic basis for didanosine (ddl) resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) has previously been shown to be commonly associated with a Leu to Val change at codon 74 in the HIV-1 RT gene. In this study sequential viral isolates were analyzed from five patients with prior zidovudine (AZT) use who received 6 to 16 months of ddl therapy. Following ddl therapy, viral isolates exhibited an increased AZT susceptibility and decreased ddl susceptibility. Sequence and nested PCR analysis of the HIV-1 RT gene revealed that two viral isolates contained the Leu to Val change at codon 74, and three other isolates with reduced susceptibility to ddl each contained changes at codons 65, 70, and 72. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to insert specific mutations in RT gene of proviral clone pNL4-3. Analysis of virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity indicated that the Lys70Arg mutation resulted in an enzyme with 2- to 4-fold decreased susceptibility to ddATP. Statistical analysis of the inhibitory concentration for RT activity between pNL4-3 and mutant Lys70Arg viruses obtained in three independent RT inhibition assays was significant (P = 0.05) by student t test paired analysis. Drug susceptibility assays on the virus with Lys70Arg mutation showed a marginal decrease in susceptibility to ddl (1.5- to 2-fold) and about 4- to 6-fold decrease in susceptibility to AZT. Mutations Lys65Glu and Arg72Ser resulted in an impaired RT with greatly diminished functional RT activity. The AZT-associated Lys70Arg mutation results in an RT enzyme with decreased susceptibility to ddATP."
531,0.005,1.0000,"The authors reviewed the medical records of 194 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients newly diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis and all 3,564 patients with newly diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at San Francisco General Hospital for the period 1986-1992. The study was designed to address three questions: 1) How do AIDS patients who present with cryptosporidiosis differ from other patients with AIDS? 2) What factors are associated with survival among AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis? 3) Does a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis impact survival after AIDS diagnosis? A total of 194 cases of cryptosporidiosis among HIV-infected patients were identified during the study period. Of the 194 patients, 109 (56%) had no prior diagnosis of AIDS. These 109 patients represented 3.1% of the 3,564 newly diagnosed cases of AIDS in the same period. Among the 134 patients with CD4 T-lymphocyte counts performed within 3 months of Cryptosporidium diagnosis, 34 (25%) had CD4 counts greater than 209 cells/ml. In a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the incidence of Cryptosporidium was related to ethnicity (for blacks vs. whites, matched odds ratio (OR) = 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.73), CD4 count (for a CD4 count of < or = 53 cells/ml vs. > 53 cells/ml, matched OR = 12.60, 95% CI 4.01-39.61), and age (for a 10-year increase, matched OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.98). Two factors measured at the time of Cryptosporidium diagnosis were identified as being independently associated with survival (p < 0.001) in the proportional hazards model: CD4 count < or = 53 cells/ml versus > 53 cells/ml (relative hazard = 6.18, 95% CI 2.99-12.76) and hematocrit < or 37% versus > 37% (relative hazard = 2.27, 95% CI 1.22-4.22). The median durations of survival in the four subgroups of Cryptosporidium-infected patients defined by these two variables differed significantly from each other (range, 204-1,119 days). Cryptosporidiosis as an initial AIDS-defining diagnosis was associated with an elevated relative hazard of death in comparison with other AIDS-defining diagnoses (relative hazard = 2.01, 95% CI 1.38-2.93). These data identify the groups of HIV-infected individuals at risk for presentation with symptomatic Cryptosporidium infection; the distinct survival patterns among subgroups of those patients already infected with this parasite; and the survival of AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis relative to patients with other AIDS-defining conditions. Such information is necessary for the design of prospective studies, the development of prophylactic strategies, the evaluation of candidate therapies, and the provision of prognostic information to patients."
4644,0.005,1.0000,"Korea is a low prevalence country for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and has an intermediate tuberculosis (TB) burden. We previously reported that the incidence of TB in HIV-infected patients was 9.6 cases per 100 person-years (P-Y) between 1988 and 1997. The aims of the present study were to measure any change in incidence from the previous study, and to identify risk factors for TB in HIV-infected patients. We reviewed all medical records of HIV-infected patients who were followed-up in one tertiary hospital between 1998 and 2010. Over the total observation period of 5858.33 P-Y, TB developed in 70 patients (1.19 cases per 100 P-Y; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-1.47 cases per 100 P-Y). Based on Poisson regression, one risk factor associated with TB was an initial CD4+ cell count below 200 cells/µL (relative risk, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.47-3.73). Mean CD4+ cell counts of pulmonary, extrapulmonary, and both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB were 179.8 cells/µL, 138.3 cells/µL, and 114.2 cells/µL, respectively (P = 0.55). In conclusion, the incidence of TB in HIV-infected patients has decreased since the previous study. An initial CD4+ cell count below 200 cells/µL is an independent risk factor for development of TB in HIV-infected patients."

Blood culture, induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage, nasopharyngeal aspirate and gastric lavage were performed. Of the total, 151 children (60.4%) were HIV-infected. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), occurring in 19 (7.6%) children (15 HIV-positive), was the AIDS-defining infection in 20.3%. The incidence and type of bacteraemia (14.3%) were similar in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients; S. pneumoniae (5%) and S. aureus (2%) were the predominant isolates. Sputum or BAL cultures yielded bacteria in 145 of 243 (60%) specimens; viruses were cultured in 37 (15.2%). Bacterial prevalence (including M. tuberculosis in 8%) and anti-microbial resistance did not differ by HIV status except for S. aureus which was more common in HIV-infected children. Thirty-one (20%) HIV-positive and 8 (8%) HIV-negative children died [RR 1.16 (95% CI 1.05-1.28), p=0.008]; using multiple logistic regression, PCP was the only risk factor for mortality (p = 0.03)."
456,0.005,1.0000,"A retrospective study of 153 hemophiliacs infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) was performed to determine the clinical and immunological consequences of HIV-1 infection and the markers and cofactors associated with these changes. Nearly 80% of HIV-1-infected hemophiliacs have developed a significant reduction in their CD-4+ counts (less than 400 CD-4+ cells/mm3) with 40% having less than 200 CD-4+ cells/mm3 by the end of 1987. The rate of CD-4+ cell count decline was slightly greater in patients who have already developed the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) compared to those who have not (50 vs. 31 cells/mm3/6 months). Thrombocytopenia and older age were associated with a more rapid CD-4+ count deterioration, but the quantity of clotting factor utilized did not affect immunologic progression. In patients with less than 200 CD-4+ cells/mm3, the incidence of AIDS was significantly higher in adults (greater than 21 years old) compared to children/adolescents. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seroprevalence increased with age but did not correlate with the amount of concentrated clotting factor used. Although there was no relationship between CMV status and progression to AIDS, CMV-seropositive patients were older and had a lower CD-4+ count. Thus the majority of HIV-1-infected hemophiliacs are developing progressive immune dysfunction measured by CD-4+ count decline. This drop in CD-4+ count significantly correlates with a risk for the development of AIDS in adults but not in children (less than 21 years old)."

Using a counting-process formulation of the Cox model, we analyzed observation time in these 2 groups for persons who were prescribed antiretroviral therapy but not prophylaxis. The incidences of the infections were low for patients whose CD4(+) count rose above the threshold of risk (PCP, 0.6 cases per 100 person-years [PY]; MAC, 1. 0 cases per 100 PY) and not higher than in persons whose CD4(+) counts had not decreased below these thresholds, which suggests that discontinuation of primary prophylaxis for opportunistic infections may be considered for some patients."
5715,0.005,1.0000,"Inflammation in early human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) disease progression is not well characterized. Ninety patients with untreated primary HIV-1 infection were studied to determine associations of inflammatory proteins with early disease progression. High plasma tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels (≥8.5 pg/mL) were significantly associated with an increased viral load set point and shorter times to reaching a CD4(+) T-cell count of <500 cells/mm(3) and initiating antiretroviral therapy. The increased risk of reaching a CD4(+) T-cell count of <500 cells/mm(3) in the group with high TNF-α levels was driven by viral load but was independent of concurrent CD4(+) T-cell count. Thus, TNF-α appears to be an important mediator of inflammation in patients with poor viral control and early HIV-1 disease progression."

There is limited data on the incidence of active co-infection with HBV and/or HCV in cancer patients infected with HIV in Africa. This was a prospective study based on 34 patients with varied cancer diagnosis, infected with HIV and awaiting cancer therapy in South Africa. HIV viral load, CD4+ cell counts, Alanine-aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were tested. Exposure to HBV and HCV was assessed serologically using commercial kits. Active HBV and/or HCV co-infection was detected using viral specific nested PCR assays. HCV 5'-UTR PCR products were sequenced to confirm active HCV infection. Active viral infection was detected in 64.7% of patients for HBV, 38.2% for HCV, and 29.4% for both HBV and HCV. Occult HBV infection was observed in 63.6% of the patients, while seronegative HCV infection was found in 30.8% of patients. In addition, CD4+ cell count < 350 cells/µl was not a risk factor for increased active HBV, HCV or both HBV and HCV co-infections. A total of 72.7%, 18.2% and 9.1% of the HCV sequences were assigned genotype 5, 1 and 4 respectively.The study revealed for the first time a high active HBV and/or HCV co-infection rate in cancer patients infected with HIV. The findings call for HBV and HCV testing in such patients, and where feasible, appropriate antiviral treatment be indicated, as chemotherapy or radiotherapy has been associated with reactivation of viral hepatitis and termination of cancer therapy."

High-risk sexual exposures accounted for 17 infections, and intravenous drug use accounted for 6. Four subjects received placebo, 13 received a complete immunization schedule (> or = 3 injections), and 6 were partially immunized (< or = 2 injections). There was no significant difference between vaccine recipients and control groups in incidence of HIV-1 infection, virus load, CD4 lymphocyte count, or V3 loop amino acid sequence. In summary, 19 vaccinated subjects acquired HIV-1 infection during phase I and II trials, indicating that immunization with the products described is < 100% effective in preventing or rapidly clearing infection. Laboratory analysis suggested that vaccine-induced immune responses did not significantly affect the genotypic or phenotypic characteristics of transmitted virus or the early clinical course of HIV-1 infection."
6402,0.005,1.0000,"Female sex workers (FSWs) are considered a high-risk group for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection due to their social vulnerability and factors associated with their work. We estimated the prevalence of HIV, and identified viral subtypes and risk factors among FSWs. A cross-sectional study using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) method was conducted among 402 FSWs in Campo Grande city, Brazil, from 2009 to 2011. Participants were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire about sociodemograpic characteristics and risk behavior. Blood samples were collected for serological testing of HIV. Of the 402 FSWs, median age and age of initiating sex work were 25 years (Interquartile range [IQR]: 9) and 20 years (IQR: 6), respectively. The majority reported use of alcohol (88.5%), had 5-9 years (median: 9; IQR: 3) of schooling (54.5%), 68.6% had tattoos/body piercings, and 45.1% had more than seven clients per week (median: 7; IQR: 10). Only 32.9% of FSW reported using a condom with nonpaying partners in the last sexual contact. Prevalence of HIV infection was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.1-2.6%). Genotyping for HIV-1 performed on three samples detected subtypes B, C, and F1. Sex work in the Midwestern region of Brazil is characterized by reduced education, large numbers of clients per week, and inconsistent condom use, mainly with nonpaying partners. Although prevalence of HIV infection is currently low, elevated levels of high-risk sexual behavior confirm a need to implement prevention measures. Specific interventions targeting FSWs must emphasize the risk associated with both clients and nonpaying partners while providing knowledge about HIV prevention. "
5883,0.005,1.0000,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) are a large high-risk population for HIV infection in recent years in China. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Hangzhou, China, to determine rates of condomless anal intercourse (CAI), recent HIV testing (in the recent year) and associated factors using respondent-driven sampling. Questionnaires using face-to-face interviews were employed to collect data on sexual risk behaviors and HIV testing. Five hundred eleven MSM were recruited, of which 459 (89.8%) had anal intercourse in the past 6 months. Of these 459 participants, 457 (99.6%) answered whether they had taken an HIV test in the recent year, so only their data were analyzed. Weighted data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. The CAI rate with male partners in the past 6 months was 43.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.0-51.5%), while the rate of condomless vaginal intercourse (CVI) was 21.6% (95% CI, 15.6-32.3%). The prevalence of recent HIV testing was 56.8% (95% CI, 48.7-66.5%), while the prevalence of HIV and syphilis were 8.8% and 6.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that CAI was associated with earlier homosexual debut, suicidal inclinations, childhood sexual abuse, HIV testing in the recent year, and lower estimate of HIV prevalence. Recent HIV testing was associated with homosexual debut age, engaging in CAI with male partners in the past 6 months, having oral sex in the past 6 months, self-perceived higher likelihood of HIV infection, knowing about antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS, receiving AIDS/sexually transmitted infection (STI) interventions in the past year, and syphilis infection. Given high prevalence of HIV and syphilis, high levels of CAI and CVI, and low HIV testing rate, the results indicated high risk of HIV infection and transmission among MSM. HIV prevention interventions should target MSM with early homosexual debut and psychosocial health problems, while HIV/AIDS education among MSM should focus on increasing knowledge of HIV risk, estimated HIV prevalence and antiretroviral therapy, and improving risk perception of HIV acquisition."
6495,0.005,1.0000,"Although myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are well known for their immunosuppressive function in several pathological conditions, the role of MDSCs in hepatitis B virus infection remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the frequency and function of MDSCs in the peripheral blood and liver of 91 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. A higher percentage of MDSCs, defined as CD14(+)HLA-DR(-/low), was detected in peripheral blood of CHB patients than that of the healthy controls. Moreover, high expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and secretion of IL-10 in this population were determined. The frequency of MDSCs was positively correlated with serum viral load, but it was negatively correlated with liver inflammatory injury. These cells were also abundant in liver tissue of CHB patients and were related to necroinflammatory activity. Furthermore, we found that these cells could suppress hepatitis B virus-specific CD8(+) T cell response, including reduced proliferation and IFN-γ production, and inhibit degranulation of CD8(+) T cells, including reduced production of granzyme B and perforin. Importantly, PD-1-induced IL-10 production by MDSCs was responsible for the suppressive activity. To our knowledge, for the first time our study proved that CD14(+)HLA-DR(-/low)PD-1(+) MDSCs in CHB patients contribute to an inadequate immune response against the virus and lead to chronic infection, which represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

1355,0.005,1.0000,"Non-adherence is one of the major causes of treatment failure which leads to increased morbidity and mortality caused by opportunistic infections. Optimal anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence is essential for maximal suppression of viral replication and long term survival of patients. In order to develop effective public health interventions in the context of scaling ART services to peripheral areas, it is important to evaluate factors associated with non-adherence among HIV-infected individuals in Pwani Region. The purpose of this study was to identify factors related to non-adherence to ART among HIV infected people in Pwani Region eastern of Tanzania. A case-control study was carried out at Tumbi Hospital and Chalinze Health Centre in Pwani Region in eastern Tanzania. A structured questionnaire was used to assess non-adherence and adherence to doses instruction and time schedule. Patients with less than 95% adherence were defined as cases while those with more than 95% adherence became controls. A structured questionnaire containing factors known to be associated with non-adherence to ART in similar settings was administered. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with non-adherence. A total of 79 cases and 237 controls matched by age and sex were studied. A high proportion of cases and controls (77.2% and 84.8%) had good knowledge ofART benefits, adherence and eligibility. Majority of cases (73.3%) and controls (69.2%) used public transport to access ART services. More than half of cases (53.2%) missed clinic appointments due to lack of bus fare or other reasons and was associated with ART non adherence (mOR 4.2, 95%CI, 2.2-8.1 and 2.1,95%CI 1.2-4.2). Disclosure to confidants only and failure to disclose HIV-test positive status were associated with non adherence (mOR 3.3, 95%CI 1.3-8.5 and 2.3, 95%CI 1.2-7.1). Alcohol use was associated with non adherence to ART (mOR 1.9, 95%CI 1.4-3.7). Patients who were not satisfied with providers were more likely to be non adherence to ART (mOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.2-3.8). In conclusion, these findings show that adherence is a process which is depended on local specific adherence factors. Adherence improvement strategies need to consider site specific adherence determinants, patient experiences and concerns."
8,0.005,1.0000,"Recent studies suggest that CD8(+) T cells with down-regulated CD8 expression (CD3(+)CD8(low) T cells) represented as a distinct phenotype of CD8(+) T cells are increased and linked to disease severity in some chronically persistent infection, such as chronic HIV and parasite infection. However, the role of CD3(+)CD8(low) T cells in the context of chronic HBV infection is poorly understood. In this study, peripheral blood samples of 47 chronic hepatitis B patients and 19 healthy controls were collected and tested for the frequency and phenotype of CD8(low) T cells. The circulating CD8(low) T cells were significantly more frequent in the patients compared to those in healthy controls, and the CD8(low) T cells in the patients expressed less IFN-γ and more mTGF-β1 than those in the controls, suggesting their type-2 polarized and suppressive properties. Meanwhile, the concentrations of plasma soluble HLA class I molecules were found elevated in the patients, and positively associated with the frequencies of CD8(low) T cells. Furthermore, the CD8(low) T-cell frequency in the HLA-A2-positive patients (n=21) was found negatively correlated with the T-cell responsiveness against the HBc₁₈₋₂₇ peptide, the latter was impaired as revealed by IFN-γ Elispot assay. Our findings suggested that a better understanding of the involvement of CD8(low) T cells in chronically persistent HBV infection would add to our knowledge of the impaired T-cell response in the patients."
4633,0.005,1.0000,"GV-TH-01, a Phase 1 open-label trial of a DNA prime—Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) boost vaccine (GOVX-B11), was undertaken in HIV infected participants on antiretroviral treatment (ART) to evaluate safety and vaccine-elicited T cell responses, and explore the ability of elicited CD8+ T cells to control viral rebound during analytical treatment interruption (TI). Nine men who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 18 months of seroconversion and had sustained plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for at least 6 months were enrolled. Median age was 38 years, median pre-ART HIV-1 RNA was 140,000 copies/ml and mean baseline CD4 count was 755/μl. Two DNA, followed by 2 MVA, inoculations were given 8 weeks apart. Eight subjects completed all vaccinations and TI. Clinical and laboratory adverse events were generally mild, with no serious or grade 4 events. Only reactogenicity events were considered related to study drug. No treatment emergent viral resistance was seen. The vaccinations did not reduce viral reservoirs and virus re-emerged in all participants during TI, with a median time to re-emergence of 4 weeks. Eight of 9 participants had CD8+ T cells that could be stimulated by vaccine-matched Gag peptides prior to vaccination. Vaccinations boosted these responses as well as eliciting previously undetected CD8+ responses. Elicited T cells did not display signs of exhaustion. During TI, temporal patterns of viral re-emergence and Gag-specific CD8+ T cell expansion suggested that vaccine-specific CD8+ T cells had been stimulated by re-emergent virus in only 2 of 8 participants. In these 2, transient decreases in viremia were associated with Gag selection in known CD8+ T cell epitopes. We hypothesize that escape mutations, already archived in the viral reservoir, plus a poor ability of CD8+ T cells to traffic to and control virus at sites of re-emergence, limited the therapeutic efficacy of the DNA/MVA vaccine."
8226,0.005,1.0000,"Although HIV positive patients' adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is relatively high in African nations, as compared with industrialized nations, few studies have explored why. In the research presented here we aimed to understand the dynamics of good adherence to ART among patients receiving free ART and HIV-related services from a clinic in Arusha, Tanzania. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 6 health care providers and 36 patients at a health care center in Arusha in 2006. Interviews were conducted in Swahili using interview guides informed by social cognitive theory. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed in Kiswahili, translated into English and coded for themes and patterns with ATLAS.ti. Of the 36 patients interviewed (mean time on ART 9.8 months; range 1-23 months), 32 reported perfect adherence in the previous month. Self-reported adherence was high despite economic hardship, depression, low rates of HIV disclosure and high perceived HIV-associated stigma. Five factors emerged to explain excellent adherence in the face of such barriers. First, all respondents experienced substantial improvements in their health after starting ART; this supported their confidence in the medication and motivated them to adhere. Second, their perceived need to be able to meet their family responsibilities motivated respondents to stay healthy. Third, respondents developed specific strategies to remember to take pills, particularly routinizing pill-taking by linking it with daily activities or events. Fourth, material and emotional support received from others facilitated adherence. Finally, respondents trusted the advice and instructions of their health care providers, who regularly emphasized adherence. The facilitating factors identified were consistent with the constructs of social cognitive theory and highlighted the importance of interventions that address multiple levels of influence on adherence."
1454,0.005,1.0000,"Little research has been conducted in less wealthy nations to evaluate the prevalence of severe life traumas in general population groups and the impact of such traumas. Previous studies in wealthy nations have found that experiencing severe traumas can cause elevated levels of anxiety, but few studies have examined this association in non-disaster situations in less wealthy nations. Trauma and trauma-related anxiety are associated with greater sexual risk taking behaviours, lower HIV medication adherence levels and poorer health outcomes in wealthy nations. The objectives of this manuscript are: (1) to compare rates of trauma in two HIV-positive samples from areas that have not experienced disaster situations that are recognized by the international community as traumatic events; and (2) to examine whether the reported traumatic experiences are similarly associated with self-reported mental and physical health. The samples come from a region of a wealthy nation that consistently experiences large increases in incident AIDS cases and where the epidemic is largely transmitted heterosexually (Deep South, United States; n =611) and a region in a less wealthy nation with relatively high HIV prevalence and incidence rates and where transmission is also primarily heterosexual (Moshi, Tanzania; n =72). Compared to the US sample, the Tanzanian sample reported significantly higher rates of trauma in the areas of illness, injury, accidents and ""other"" significant traumas, a higher prevalence of anxiety and poorer physical health. The experience of trauma was similarly associated with greater mental health symptomatology and poorer physical health in both samples. Further investigation into the area of trauma and its sequelae is warranted, particularly in relation to risk behaviours and HIV medication adherence. At a time of increasing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in less wealthy nations, additional focus on trauma care could improve ART adherence rates and reduce risk behaviors, thereby assisting in stemming the further spread of the epidemic."
3727,0.005,1.0000,"Genotyping of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) for antiretroviral drug resistance is routinely used both in clinical practice, to guide the selection of options for an individual's antiretroviral therapy, and in epidemiological studies, to estimate levels of antiretroviral drug resistance in a patient population. However, reliance on results of a single test can result in an underestimation of antiretroviral drug resistance. In the present study, we quantified the prevalence of resistance-associated mutations found in recent genotypic tests of 1734 HIV-1-infected, treatment-experienced subjects who had at least 3 genotypic tests (n = 11,404 genotypic tests total; median, 5 tests/subject) and compared it with that of resistance-associated mutations ever detected in these subjects between 1996 and 2004. Single-point analyses underestimated antiretroviral drug resistance, particularly for nucleoside analogues, in both individuals and patient populations. For example, the prevalence of resistance-associated mutation M184V/I was 25.5% in the most recent genotypes and 58.8% in available historical genotypes. Our results suggest that analysis of a combined historical genotype rather than of a cross-sectional genotype may lead to more accurate estimates of antiretroviral drug resistance in individual patients and in patient populations."
8628,0.005,1.0000,"Many clinicians who care for patients with HIV infection are dissatisfied with the existing recommendations on antiretroviral therapy. Current practice focuses on the early suppression of viremia, yet the outcome of that approach may not be in the best interest of individual patients or populations. The major goal of HIV therapy is to maintain the long-term health of the patient while avoiding drug-related toxicity and preserving viable future treatment options. Recent studies have challenged the principles on which recommendations for early, aggressive treatment were based. Key studies that lead to licensure of antiretroviral medications usually involve short-term results in treatment-naive patients; it is difficult to apply these results to long-term management of therapy-experienced patients. Early, aggressive therapy often prematurely exposes patients to risks for medication-related side effects and resistance. A more cautious, patient-focused, long-term approach to therapy would help foster studies of alternate strategies, such as delayed initiation of therapy, protease-sparing therapy, class-sparing therapy, planned drug interruptions, switches in therapy, and immune-based therapy. It is time for clinicians to rethink their approach to the treatment of HIV infection."
7555,0.005,1.0000,"The conserved membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 is a target of two broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies, 2F5 and 4E10, and is an important lead for vaccine design. However, immunogens that bear MPER epitopes so far have not elicited neutralizing antibodies in laboratory animals. One explanation is that the immunogens fail to recreate the proper molecular environment in which the epitopes of 2F5 and 4E10 are presented on the virus. To explore this molecular environment, we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis across residues 660 to 680 in the MPER of a pseudotyped variant of HIV-1(JR-FL), designated HIV-1(JR2), and examined the ability of 2F5 and 4E10 to neutralize the Ala mutant viruses. The results show that the only changes to produce neutralization resistance to 2F5 occurred in residue D, K, or W of the core epitope (LELDKWANL). Likewise, 4E10 resistance arose by replacing one of three residues; two (W and F) were in the core epitope, and one (W) was seven residues C-terminal to these two (NWFDISNWLW). Importantly, no single substitution resulted in resistance of virus to both 2F5 and 4E10. Surprisingly, 8 out of 21 MPER Ala mutants were more sensitive than the parental pseudovirus to 2F5 and/or 4E10. At most, only small differences in neutralization sensitivity to anti-gp120 monoclonal antibody b12 and peptide T20 were observed with the MPER Ala mutant pseudoviruses. These data suggest that MPER substitutions can act locally and enhance the neutralizing activity of antibodies to this region and imply a distinct role of the MPER of gp41 during HIV-1 envelope-mediated fusion. Neutralization experiments showing synergy between and T20 and 4E10 against HIV-1 are also presented. The data presented may aid in the design of antigens that better present the MPER of gp41 to the immune system."
5321,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 and related viruses require co-receptors, in addition to CD4, to infect target cells. The chemokine receptor CCR-5 (ref.1) was recently demonstrated to be a co-receptor for macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 strains, and the orphan receptor LESTR (also called fusin) allows infection by strains adapted for growth in transformed T-cell lines (T-tropic strains). Here we show that a mutant allele of CCR-5 is present at a high frequency in caucasian populations (allele frequency, 0.092), but is absent in black populations from Western and Central Africa and Japanese populations. A 32-base-pair deletion within the coding region results in a frame shift, and generates a non-functional receptor that does not support membrane fusion or infection by macrophage- and dual-tropic HIV-1 strains. In a cohort of HIV-1 infected caucasian subjects, no individual homozygous for the mutation was found, and the frequency of heterozygotes was 35% lower than in the general population. White blood cells from an individual homozygous for the null allele were found to be highly resistant to infection by M-tropic HIV-1 viruses, confirming that CCR-5 is the major co-receptor for primary HIV-1 strains. The lower frequency of heterozygotes in seropositive patients may indicate partial resistance."
3646,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) elite controllers (EC) maintain viremia below the limit of commercial assay detection (<50 RNA copies/ml) in the absence of antiviral therapy, but the mechanisms of control remain unclear. HLA-B57 and the closely related allele B*5801 are particularly associated with enhanced control and recognize the same Gag(240-249) TW10 epitope. The typical escape mutation (T242N) within this epitope diminishes viral replication capacity in chronically infected persons; however, little is known about TW10 epitope sequences in residual replicating viruses in B57/B*5801 EC and the extent to which mutations within this epitope may influence steady-state viremia. Here we analyzed TW10 in a total of 50 B57/B*5801-positive subjects (23 EC and 27 viremic subjects). Autologous plasma viral sequences from both EC and viremic subjects frequently harbored the typical cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-selected mutation T242N (15/23 sequences [65.2%] versus 23/27 sequences [85.1%], respectively; P = 0.18). However, other unique mutants were identified in HIV controllers, both within and flanking TW10, that were associated with an even greater reduction in viral replication capacity in vitro. In addition, strong CTL responses to many of these unique TW10 variants were detected by gamma interferon-specific enzyme-linked immunospot assay. These data suggest a dual mechanism for durable control of HIV replication, consisting of viral fitness loss resulting from CTL escape mutations together with strong CD8 T-cell immune responses to the arising variant epitopes."
6295,0.005,1.0000,"Coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is common as a result of shared routes of transmission, especially in high-risk groups such as injection drug users and persons with hemophilia. HIV is known to influence the natural history of HBV, hastening progression to end-stage liver disease and cirrhosis. Antiretroviral therapy for HIV, and associated immune reconstitution, may result in immune-mediated liver damage as HBV-infected hepatocytes are targeted. This can lead to liver enzyme elevations that may be misattributed to drug-related toxicity. Thus, it is important that HIV-infected patients be tested for HBV and that clinicians be aware of the possibility of atypical serologic markers of HBV in HIV-infected patients. In managing coinfected patients, control of HIV is the priority. In patients with controlled HIV who are candidates for HBV therapy, the goals are the same as in the HBV-monoinfected population: hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, liver enzyme normalization, and HBV DNA suppression. Treatment options include interferon-based regimens, lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, and entecavir. All of these agents have been shown to be relatively effective in HBV-monoinfected patients. However, few randomized, controlled HBV treatment trials have been conducted in coinfected subjects, and thus additional studies are warranted."
1672,0.005,1.0000,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was first recognized as a new disease in 1981 because of the unusual association of Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in young men. The skin remains one of the most important clinical markers for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, now recognized as the end stage of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Indeed, an urticarial viral exanthem appearing during seroconversion may allow early identification of newly infected individuals who might benefit from administration of antiviral therapy during plasma viremia. The ""asymptomatic HIV infection"" is often accompanied by multiple skin complaints, which commonly include xerosis, pruritus, psoriasis/seborrheic dermatitis, and pruritic papular eruptions, the cause of which remains controversial. Psoriasis and Kaposi's sarcoma lesions share features including angiogenesis, dermal dendrocytes infected with HIV, and epidermal hyperproliferation, and are manifested by mice transgenic for HIV provirus or Tat-ltr. Changes in the immune system including T-cell function, antigen response, and shifting cytokine expression as well as a propensity for autoimmune reactions must underlie the skin immunodysfunction occurring in the setting of HIV infection. One of the most unsettling controversies suggested by in vitro data is that ultraviolet light, an effective therapy for HIV-related skin disorders, may actually activate the virus."
6155,0.005,1.0000,"In hepatitis B virus carriers who are anti-HBe positive despite ongoing viral replication (HBcAg in liver and HBV-DNA in serum) the natural course of hepatitis is severe and the response to interferon is low. We investigated whether a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) strain could be involved. A translational termination codon at the carboxyterminal end of the pre-C region responsible for the lack of HBeAg secretion was found in 18 of 19 HBV clones isolated from seven pedigreed patients with this clinical syndrome. The same findings were confirmed by direct sequencing. One of these patients underwent a liver transplant and HBV infection of the new liver resulted in high titered viremia and intrahepatic expression of HBcAg, without detectable HBeAg in serum. Another patient was superinfected by hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and developed high titres of total and IgM anti-HD. In spite of this, chronic hepatitis remained unchanged during 7 years of follow-up. These data strongly suggest that a viable precore minus mutant of hepatitis B virus is responsible for the lack of HBeAg in the serum of these patients. The HBV variant may explain the peculiar geographic distribution of anti-HBe positive hepatitis. The variations in the virus genome sequence may cause the more severe form of liver disease and modify the pathogenicity in the case of HDV superinfection."
9794,0.005,1.0000,"Viral liver diseases are frequent comorbidities and major contributors to death in HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Although cure of hepatitis C and control of hepatitis B with antivirals avert liver disease progression in most HIV-coinfected patients, the lack of satisfactory treatment for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection remains a major threat for developing cirrhosis and liver cancer in this population. In the European Union (EU) and North America, sexual contact has replaced injection drug use that has been the major transmission route for HDV in HIV-positive persons. PegIFNα is the only approved HDV therapy; however, sustained HDV-RNA clearance is achieved by less than 25%. The recent discovery of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide as the key hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV cell entry receptor has opened the door to a new therapeutic era. Indeed, promising results have been released using Myrcludex-B, a sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide inhibitor. More encouraging are data with new classes of HDV blockers, such as prenylation inhibitors (i.e. lonafarnib) and nucleic acid polymers. At this time, sustained suppression of HDV replication is the primary goal of HDV therapy, as it is associated with normalization of liver enzymes and histological improvement. Of note, the use of specific antivirals for HDV must be given along with anti-HBV agents to prevent HBV rebounds following removal of viral interference. The lack of persistent forms of HDV-RNA could provide a unique opportunity for curing hepatitis delta, even without eliminating HBV circular covalently closed DNA. Ultimately, suppression of HDV replication along with hepatitis B surface antigen clearance once drugs are off would be the best reflect of hepatitis delta cure."
5400,0.005,1.0000,"The Study of Fat Redistribution and Metabolic Change in HIV Infection (FRAM), initiated in 2000, investigates the prevalence and correlates of changes in fat distribution, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men and women compared with a population-based group of control men and women. Between June 2000 and September 2002, 1,480 participants (1,183 HIV-infected persons and 297 controls) were enrolled in FRAM. Measurements taken included whole-body magnetic resonance imaging for quantification of regional fat, anthropometric measurements, central laboratory analysis of metabolites, and assessment of symptoms, sociodemographic factors, and lifestyle. Similar measurements were repeated among FRAM participants 4 years later (FRAM 2) for investigation of the progression of fat distribution changes, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. In FRAM 2, which is ongoing, investigators are also determining the associations of subclinical cardiovascular disease, as measured by carotid intimal-medial wall thickness, with HIV infection, fat distribution changes, insulin resistance, and other proatherogenic changes in serum lipid levels. The demographic characteristics of HIV-infected FRAM men and women were comparable to those reported from a national random sampling of HIV-infected men and women receiving medical care in the United States. The representativeness of the FRAM sample increases its value as a resource for studies on fat distribution, metabolic changes, and atherosclerosis in HIV infection."
3164,0.005,1.0000,"System dynamics (SD) modeling belongs to the rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary field of system science research. This field adds value to more traditional health research by contributing to the design and testing of complex integrated models of change, to examine health system performance and patient outcomes. Using selected milestones in HIV care management to frame our simulation research, we created a SD model to examine three patient subgroups of women of color (WOC) represented in our multi-site cohort, classified by their health care seeking status at baseline. Asked to reflect on their circumstance 6 months prior to enrollment in the MSE cohort, 53% noted they were receiving some care (In Care, n = 341), 31% that they had been seeking care (Seeking Care, n = 201), and 16% that they were undecided about seeking care (i.e., answered that they may or may not look for care) for treatment of their HIV (May or May Not Seek Care, n = 103). Our SD model compared simulated patterns of patient retention over 24 months in relation to: (1) access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), (2) adherence to ART, and (3) viral suppression. Assessed patterns yielded insights about system capacities and constraints in the context of the SPNS initiative under evaluation."
1140,0.005,1.0000,"To better understand patient beliefs, which may influence adherence to HIV care and treatment, we examined three dimensions of beliefs among Ethiopian adults (n = 1177) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). Beliefs about benefits of ART/HIV clinical care were largely accurate, but few patients believed in the ability of ART to prevent sexual transmission and many thought Holy Water could cure HIV. Factors associated with lower odds of accurate beliefs included advanced HIV, lack of formal education, and Muslim religion (benefits of ART/clinical care); secondary or university education and more clinic visits (ART to prevent sexual transmission); and pregnancy and Orthodox Christian religion (Holy Water). Assessment of patient beliefs may help providers identify areas needing reinforcement. In this setting, counselors also need to stress the benefits of ART as prevention and that Holy Water should not be used to the exclusion of HIV care and ART."
8861,0.005,1.0000,"In 1994, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) recommended the use of zidovudine (ZDV) to reduce perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission; in 1995, USPHS recommended universal prenatal HIV counseling and voluntary testing. Widespread implementation of these recommendations, together with increased use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and scheduled cesarean delivery, has resulted in substantial declines in perinatal HIV transmission. However, perinatal HIV transmission continues to occur. To identify missed prevention opportunities, CDC analyzed the incidence of perinatal HIV infection among a cohort of HIV-exposed infants born during 1997-2000 at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, Georgia. This report describes the results of that analysis and underscores the challenges to universal prevention of infant HIV infections. Efforts to reduce perinatal HIV transmission should focus on increasing prenatal care rates, promoting adherence to recommended treatment regimens during pregnancy, and increasing prenatal HIV testing, particularly in areas where missed opportunities for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission persist."
7695,0.005,1.0000,"Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy is an important intervention to prevent the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV and to promote maternal health. Early initiation of ART is particularly important to achieve viral suppression rapidly before delivery. However, current approaches to start ART in pregnancy may be problematic in many settings, with referrals between antenatal care (ANC) and ART services, and delays for patient preparation before ART initiation. These steps contribute to a sizable proportion of women failing to receive adequate duration of ART before delivery, increasing the risk of MTCT. To address these limitations, we developed the rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy (RAP) programme. The programme featured the use of point-of-care CD4 testing to identify ART-eligible women with CD4 cell counts ≤ 350 cells/µl; immediate ART initiation in women on the same day that eligibility was determined, if possible; and intensive counselling and support for ART initiation during the first few weeks on ART. We implemented RAP in an antenatal clinic setting in Cape Town South Africa. Between February and August 2011, a total of 221 HIV-infected women were referred to the programme for CD4 cell count testing and 101 (46%) were eligible for ART. Of these, 98 women (97%) started therapy during pregnancy, 89 (91%) on the day of referral to the service. In-depth interviews suggested that although there were substantial challenges facing HIV-infected women initiating ART in pregnancy, the availability of immediate services and counselling support played an important role in addressing these. While further research is needed, this evaluation demonstrates that a novel service delivery approach may facilitate rapid ART initiation in pregnancy."

This fourth edition of the guidelines, made available on the Internet in 2001, is intended for clinicians and other health-care providers who care for HIV-infected persons. The goal of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based guidelines for preventing OIs among HIV-infected adults and adolescents, including pregnant women, and HIV-exposed or infected children. Nineteen OIs, or groups of OIs, are addressed, and recommendations are included for preventing exposure to opportunistic pathogens, preventing first episodes of disease by chemoprophylaxis or vaccination (primary prophylaxis), and preventing disease recurrence (secondary prophylaxis). Major changes since the last edition of the guidelines include 1) updated recommendations for discontinuing primary and secondary OI prophylaxis among persons whose CD4+ T lymphocyte counts have increased in response to antiretroviral therapy; 2) emphasis on screening all HIV-infected persons for infection with hepatitis C virus; 3) new information regarding transmission of human herpesvirus 8 infection; 4) new information regarding drug interactions, chiefly related to rifamycins and antiretroviral drugs; and 5) revised recommendations for immunizing HIV-infected adults and adolescents and HIV-exposed or infected children."
741,0.005,1.0000,"Despite disproportionate rates of HIV among transgender women and evidence that medication adherence is necessary for treatment success and increased likelihood of survival, there has been little investigation into antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence issues among transgender women.

Transgender women on ART were less likely to report 90% adherence rates or higher and reported less confidence in their abilities to integrate treatment regimens into their daily lives. When transgender women were compared to other respondents, regardless of the current medication regimen, they reported significantly fewer positive interactions with their health care providers. Training for providers and integration of hormone therapy into HIV care is recommended."

This prospective cohort study aimed to assess the determinants of and the temporal trends in HIV-1 vertical transmission in the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte, Brazil from January 1998 to December 2005. The rate of HIV-1 vertical transmission decreased from 20% in 1998 to 3% in 2005. This decline was associated with increased use of more complex ART regimens during pregnancy. Multivariate analysis restricted to clinical variables demonstrated that non ART, neonatal respiratory distress/sepsis and breastfeeding were independently associated with HIV-1 vertical transmission. When laboratory parameters were included in the model, high maternal viral load and non maternal ART were associated with HIV-1 vertical transmission. The results from this study confirm the impact of ART in the reduction of HIV-1 vertical transmission and indicate the need for improvement in the care and monitoring of mother and infant pairs affected by HIV-1."
9908,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve patients are vulnerable to becoming lost-to-care (LTC) because they are not monitored as often as patients on treatment. We examined data from 19,461 HIV positive adults at 10 HIV clinics in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Cameroon, and Burundi participating in the Phase 1 International epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS Central Africa (IeDEA-CA) study. Patients were LTC if they were ART-naïve and did not return within 7 months of the end of data collection. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk factors associated with LTC. Of 5353 ART-naïve patients, 4420 (83%) were LTC and 933 (17%) were in-care. The odds of being LTC were greatest among patients from DRC (OR = 2.16, CI: 1.64-2.84, p < .0001), males (OR = 1.39, CI: 1.15-1.69, p = .0009), and ages 18-49 (OR = 1.45, CI: 1.16-1.82, p = .001). The odds of being LTC were least among patients with a WHO Clinical Stage of 1 or 2 (OR = 0.65, CI: 0.55-0.77, p < .0001) and in a perceived concordant relationship (OR = 0.61, CI: 0.43-0.87, p < .0001). LTC patients were more likely to have characteristics associated with higher risk for HIV transmission and progression. Many entered care at advanced stages and were less likely to know their partner's serostatus. Greater efforts to retain ART-naïve patients may increase earlier initiation of ART."

We examined the association between STLEs and ARV adherence among 289 US-based participants enrolled between 7/1/2010 and 9/1/2013 in a study of depression treatment for HIV-infected patients. Participants received monthly telephone calls to assess STLEs and pill count-based ARV adherence. Inverse probability of observation weighting was combined with multiple imputation to address missing data. Participants were mostly male (71%) and black (63%), with a median age of 45 years. Median monthly adherence was 96% (interquartile range (IQR): 85-100%). Participants experienced a mean of 2.48 STLEs (range: 0-14) in the previous month. The presence of ≥2 STLEs was associated with a mean change in adherence of -3.67% (95% confidence interval (CI): -7.12%, -0.21%) and decreased likelihood of achieving ≥95% adherence (risk ratio (95% CI) = 0.82 (0.71, 0.95)). For each additional STLE, the mean adherence change was -0.90% (95% CI: -1.79%, 0.00%). STLEs were associated with poorer ARV adherence, including decreased likelihood of adhering to ≥95% of ARV doses. This level of adherence has a critical role in regimen effectiveness and prevention of resistance."

Initial evaluation of these parameters was conducted in the western countries where accessible ARVs, circulating HIV subtypes and mode of transmission are different from the situation in Nigeria. This study appraised these parameters, and efficacy of generic ARVs. Consenting 106 HIV infected ARV naïve patients were enrolled. CD4 T lymphocyte and plasma HIV RNA levels were determined at interval for 24 months. Ninety eight (92.5%) of the patients who completed the follow up in strict adherence to therapy guideline were included in the analysis. Baseline median CD4 T lymphocyte increased from 114 (Range: 6-330) to highest 357 (Range: 15-1036) cells/ μ L at 18 months of therapy, while baseline median plasma viral RNA declined from 4.6 (Range: 2.6-6.0) Log10 copies/mL to undetectable level within three months of therapy. Significant CD4 T-cell restoration and plasma viral RNA decline in the study population demonstrate efficacy of the generic HAART. The importance of combined use of both parameters for evaluation of immunologic and virologic responses to ART was confirmed. "

However, the region's health system capacity to effectively identify and treat depression is limited. Task-shifting models may help address this large mental health treatment gap. Measurement-Based Care (MBC) is a task-shifting model in which a Depression Care Manager guides a non-psychiatric (e.g., HIV) provider in prescribing and managing antidepressant treatment. We adapted MBC for depressed HIV-infected patients in Cameroon and completed a pilot study to assess feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. We enrolled 55 participants; all started amitriptyline 25-50 mg daily at baseline. By 12 weeks, most remained at 50 mg daily (range 25-125 mg). Median (interquartile range) PHQ-9 depressive severity scores declined from 13 (12-16) (baseline) to 2 (0-3) (week 12); 87 % achieved depression remission (PHQ-9 <5) by 12 weeks. Intervention fidelity was high: HIV providers followed MBC recommendations at 96 % of encounters. Most divergences reflected a failure to increase dose when indicated. No serious and few bothersome side effects were reported. Most suicidality (prevalence 62 % at baseline; 8 % at 12 weeks) was either passive or low-risk. Participant satisfaction was high (100 %), and most participants (89 %) indicated willingness to pay for medications if MBC were implemented in routine care. The adapted MBC intervention demonstrated high feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in this uncontrolled pilot study. Further research should assess whether MBC could improve adherence and HIV outcomes in this setting. "
6835,0.005,1.0000,"Aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) has originally been considered as a noninvasive marker for detecting hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. APRI has been used for predicting liver-related mortality in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection or alcoholic liver disease. However, whether APRI could be useful for predicting mortality in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains unevaluated. This study aims to address this knowledge gap. A total of 193 hospitalized chronic HBV-infected patients (cirrhosis, n = 100; noncirrhosis, n = 93) and 88 healthy subjects were retrospectively enrolled. All patients were followed up for 4 months. Mortality that occurred within 90 days of hospital stay was compared among patients with different APRI. APRI predictive value was evaluated by univariate and multivariate regression embedded in a Cox proportional hazards model. APRI varied significantly in our cohort (range, 0.16-10.00). Elevated APRI was associated with increased severity of liver disease and 3-month mortality in hospitalized patients with HBV-related cirrhosis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that APRI (odds ratio: 1.456, P < 0.001) and the model for end-stage liver disease score (odds ratio: 1.194, P < 0.001) were 2 independent markers for predicting mortality. APRI is a simple marker that may serve as an additional predictor of 3-month mortality in hospitalized patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis."
9124,0.005,1.0000,"Nucleos(t)ide analog therapy blocks DNA synthesis by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) reverse transcriptase and can control the infection, but treatment is life-long and has high costs and unpredictable long-term side effects. The profound suppression of HBV by the nucleos(t)ide analogs and their ability to cure some patients indicates that they can push HBV to the brink of extinction. Consequently, more patients could be cured by suppressing HBV replication further using a new drug in combination with the nucleos(t)ide analogs. The HBV ribonuclease H (RNAseH) is a logical drug target because it is the second of only two viral enzymes that are essential for viral replication, but it has not been exploited, primarily because it is very difficult to produce active enzyme. To address this difficulty, we expressed HBV genotype D and H RNAseHs in E. coli and enriched the enzymes by nickel-affinity chromatography. HBV RNAseH activity in the enriched lysates was characterized in preparation for drug screening. Twenty-one candidate HBV RNAseH inhibitors were identified using chemical structure-activity analyses based on inhibitors of the HIV RNAseH and integrase. Twelve anti-RNAseH and anti-integrase compounds inhibited the HBV RNAseH at 10 µM, the best compounds had low micromolar IC(50) values against the RNAseH, and one compound inhibited HBV replication in tissue culture at 10 µM. Recombinant HBV genotype D RNAseH was more sensitive to inhibition than genotype H. This study demonstrates that recombinant HBV RNAseH suitable for low-throughput antiviral drug screening has been produced. The high percentage of compounds developed against the HIV RNAseH and integrase that were active against the HBV RNAseH indicates that the extensive drug design efforts against these HIV enzymes can guide anti-HBV RNAseH drug discovery. Finally, differential inhibition of HBV genotype D and H RNAseHs indicates that viral genetic variability will be a factor during drug development."
5265,0.005,1.0000,"Although coinfection with hepatitis C (HCV) is an established risk factor for hepatotoxicity in HIV-positive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), specific variables that may be predictive of severe hepatotoxicity among co-infected patients receiving cART remain poorly defined. A retrospective cohort study of HIV/HCV coinfected adults from two HIV treatment centers covering the period between December 1998 and December 2003 was conducted to address this question. The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) during follow-up and the primary predictors of interest were specific antiretrovirals. One hundred five coinfected patients receiving cART for a median of 70 months (interquartile range [IQR], 37, 83) were included in the analysis. Twenty-three (22%) patients developed a grade 3 or 4 increase in serum ALT at least once in follow-up. In univariate analysis, current receipt of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (odds ratio [OR] 3.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-8.34, p = 0.03), baseline ALT (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p = 0.004), and current use of boosting ritonavir (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.16-7.00, p = 0.02) were significantly associated with a grade 3 or 4 increase in serum ALT, although most patients receiving boosting ritonavir were on lopinavir/ritonavir based regimens. Patients receiving LPV/r had been previously exposed to significantly more antiretrovirals (p < 0.0001), protease inhibitors (p < 0.0001), and nucleoside analogues (p = 0.0009) compared to the rest of the cohort.

Although spliced RNA and HBSP expression have been associated with increased HBV DNA levels and liver fibrosis, the role of dDNA in HBV-associated disease is largely undefined. Our aims were to (1) compare the relative proportions of dDNA (% dDNA) in a range of HBV-infected serum samples, including patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV coinfection and HBV-monoinfected persons with differing severities of liver disease, and (2) determine the effect of mutations associated with drug resistance on defective DNA production. Defective DNA was detected in 90% of persons with CH-B. There was no significant difference in the relative abundance of dDNA between the monoinfected and HIV/HBV-coinfected groups. We also found no association between the % dDNA and alanine aminotransferase, hepatitis B e antigen status, HBV DNA levels, fibrosis levels, compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis, genotype, or drug treatment. However, the % dDNA was significantly lower in individuals infected with lamivudine-resistant (LMV-R) HBV compared with wild-type HBV (P < 0.0001), indicating that antiviral drug resistance alters the balance between defective and genomic length DNA in circulation. Experiments in vitro using HBV encoding LMV-R mutations confirmed these results."
4282,0.005,1.0000,"Primary HIV-1 infection is a relevant period for its virological and epidemiological consequences. Most patients present a symptomatic disease that can be potentially serious, but neurological involvement during primary HIV-1 infection has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of primary HIV-1 infection patients presenting neurological symptoms and to compare them with primary HIV-1 infection patients without neurological involvement. Retrospective case-control study (1:3) comparing primary HIV-1 infection patients with and without neurological involvement enrolled in the Acute/Recent Hospital Clinic PHI Cohort between 1997 and 2016. Matching criteria included age (±10 years), gender, year of diagnosis (±4 years), and Fiebig stage. The conditional logit model was used for comparisons. Fourteen out of 463 patients (3.02%) enrolled in the Acute/Recent Hospital Clinic PHI Cohort between 1997 and 2016 presented neurological symptoms. 28.5% of cases presented as meningitis and 71.5% as meningoencephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid showed non-specific findings, including pleocytosis with lymphocyte predominance and increased protein levels. All cases required hospitalisation, whereas only 19% of the controls did. No other pathogen was identified in any case, but five patients initiated empirically antimicrobial treatment for other aetiologies until diagnosis was confirmed. CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly lower (p = 0.039) and plasmatic viral load significantly higher in the case group, compared to controls (p = 0.028). Risk factors, HIV-1 tropism, subtype distribution, and prescribed ART regimens were comparable between cases and controls. After 6 months on ART, 92% of cases had undetectable viral load, similar to controls, and CD4/CD8 ratio became also comparable between groups. All cases recovered rapidly with ART and were discharged without sequels. Neurological involvement during primary HIV-1 infection is unusual but serious, always requiring hospitalisation. Diagnosis is difficult because of the wide range of symptoms and similarities with other viral aetiologies. Neurological manifestations during primary HIV-1 infection are associated with a lower CD4/CD8 ratio and with a higher viral load than controls. Immediate ART initiation and rapid viral load decrease are required, allowing complete clinical recovery."
9050,0.005,1.0000,"The aims of this study were to investigate the efficacy of prolonged entecavir (ETV) therapy in treatment-naive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and to determine whether continuous ETV therapy is feasible to achieve HBeAg seroconversion, particularly in patients with partial virological response (PVR). A total of 142 treatment-naive patients with CHB were enrolled. The mean duration of treatment was 65 (range, 26 to 90) months, and 86 patients (60.6%) were HBeAg positive. PVR was defined as detectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA (>116 copies/ml) at year 1. The cumulative incidence of virological response (VR) increased from 54.9% at year 1 to 98.2% at year 7. HBeAg positivity (odds ratio [OR], 4.146; P = 0.001) and initial alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (OR, 0.997; P = 0.004) were independent risk factors for PVR. Among the 64 patients with PVR, 47 patients (73.4%) achieved VR within 4 years after prolonged ETV therapy without treatment adaptation. Three patients (2.1%) experienced virological breakthrough and HBV variants with genotypic resistance. The cumulative rate of HBeAg seroconversion was significantly higher in the patients with VR than in the patients with PVR (P = 0.018). None of the PVR patients with HBV DNA at ≥5,000 copies/ml at year 1 ever experienced HBeAg seroconversion. Multivariate analysis identified VR at year 1 as the only determinant of HBeAg seroconversion (hazard ratio [HR], 3.009; P = 0.010). In conclusion, although there were patients with PVR, prolonged ETV therapy showed excellent VR, with only 2.1% emergence of viral resistance during a 7-year follow-up. However, to achieve HBeAg seroconversion, drug modification is needed for HBeAg-positive patients with PVR (especially those with HBV DNA at ≥5,000 copies/ml at year 1). "
5333,0.005,1.0000,"Viral blips, where HIV RNA plasma viral load (pVL) intermittently increases above the lower limit of assay detection, are a cause for concern. We investigated a number of hypotheses for their cause. We assessed HIV RNA, and total and episomal HIV DNA from 16 individuals commencing antiretroviral therapy (ART) consisting of raltegravir and tenofovir/emtricitabine for 3 years, using two assays: a single-copy assay [SCA; lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), <1 copy/ml] and the Amplicor assay (LLOQ of 50 copies/ml). Two individuals exhibited viral blips. From week 20 onward, the period where ART had achieved its final suppressive levels, pVL ranged from <1 to 330 copies/ml, except for one individual at the final time. Both assays were 98% consistent (108/110) in assessing pVL <50 copies/ml, but the Amplicor assay registered 56% of samples (19/34) as below the LLOQ that were in the 50 to 1000 copy/ml range as quantified by SCA. pVL changes between successive time points did not correlate with changes in cellular infection as measured through either total or episomal HIV DNA. Changes in pVL were correlated (negatively) with changes in total CD4(+) T cell numbers (p=0.003), naive (CD45RO(-)CD62L(+)CD4(+)), natural regulatory (CD45RO(-)CD25(+)CD127(-)CD4(+)), activated effector (CD45RO(+)CD38(++)CCR5(+)CD8(+)), but not activated (CD38(+)HLA-DR(+)) CD4(+) T cells. Patients receiving stable, seemingly suppressive ART can have pVL near the 50 copy LLOQ at multiple time points. The high Amplicor assay error rate around this level implies that viral blips underrepresent pVL being more consistently above the LLOQ. Activation of latently infected cells is less likely to contribute to this phenomenon."
2343,0.005,1.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in chronic hepatitis C patient. However, its significance and consequences are still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of occult HBV among HCV chronic carriers in France and to assess its impact on liver histology and response to antiviral therapy. To this end a cohort of 203 patients with chronic hepatitis C without hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has been examined. Serum HBV-DNA was detected using a highly sensitive PCR with primers located in the S and X genes. HBV viraemia levels were further determined by real-time PCR. Results showed that 47 of 203 (23%) patients had occult HBV infection with a low HBV load (10(2)-10(4) copies/ml) but significantly higher HCV-RNA titers (P < 0.05). No significant difference in age, gender, serum ALT level, HCV genotypes, and the presence of anti-HBc was observed between patients with or without HBV-DNA. When compared histologically, patients with occult HBV infection had higher activity (A2-A3 in 53% vs. 38%, P < 0.01) and more advanced fibrosis (60% vs. 33%, P < 0.001) than HBV-DNA negative cases. Sustained response to combination therapy against Chronic hepatitis C was achieved in 11 (28%) of 40 HBV-DNA positive cases, compared with 65 (45%) of the 144 HBV-DNA negative cases (P < 0.05). Among the 144 HBV-DNA negative HCV patients those with genotype 1 responded less frequently to therapy as compared to other genotypes infected patients (38% vs. 55%, P < 0.05). Surprisingly, when considering all patients studied, irrespective to the HBV-DNA status no significant difference was observed in response to combination therapy regarding HCV genotypes (39% vs. 44%, P > 0.05). In conclusion, HBV-DNA is found in 1/4 of French chronic hepatitis C patients regardless of the presence of anti-HBc. Such an occult HBV co-infection is associated with more severe liver disease, higher HCV viral load and decreased response to antiviral therapy irrespective of HCV genotypes."
4109,0.005,1.0000,"Liver disease is currently the second leading cause of death in HIV-infected persons in Western countries. Hepatitis C virus infection accounts for the majority of cases of hepatic illness in this population. Although great progress has been made in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-positive patients, many challenges still remain unsolved. The combination of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin is the current treatment of choice in hepatitis C virus/HIV-coinfected patients, regardless of hepatitis C virus genotype. However, the limited efficacy of this therapy in the HIV setting makes necessary the development of new strategies and/or drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C infection. Several anti-hepatitis C virus compounds are currently under investigation, although most are still in the early stages of clinical development. There is a relatively large group of patients who will be unable to be treated with the current hepatitis C virus medication based on interferon, mainly due to contraindications such as serious neuropsychiatric or cardiovascular history. However, for those without contraindications, treatment should be provided with no restrictions at the start (e.g. asking unnecessarily for a liver biopsy), and reassessed at weeks 4 and 12, considering virologic responses. Treatment should only be continued in early virologic responders. The use of standard doses of ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day) and for at least 12 months seems crucial to maximize the effect of current hepatitis C treatment in the HIV setting, while no further benefit seems to derive from using higher than recommended pegylated interferon dosages. In patients with rapid virologic response (undetectable viremia at week 4) to anti-hepatitis C therapy, shorter periods of therapy (24 weeks) may be advisable in hepatitis C genotypes 2 and 3. Finally, adequate selection of candidates and careful selection of concomitant antiretroviral medications must be encouraged. Patients with low CD4 percentages (< 15%) should be deferred for treatment and HAART prioritized in order to improve CD4 counts. When possible, nucleoside analogs such as zidovudine, stavudine, and abacavir should be replaced by others having no deleterious interactions with ribavirin (e.g. tenofovir, lamivudine, or emtricitabine). Didanosine should never be coadministered with ribavirin due to potential life-threatening complications."
2253,0.005,1.0000,"In a prospective, non-randomized, pilot study, we evaluated the efficacy of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination in inhibiting HBV replication of chronic hepatitis B. Fourteen consecutive chronic HBs antigen carriers received standard vaccination with three injections of the GenHevac B vaccine, one month apart. All the patients had active HBV replication with chronic hepatitis but not cirrhosis. They were compared to a historical group of 34 patients who fulfilled the same inclusion criteria. Over the 6-month follow-up period after the first injection, serum HBV DNA became undetectable in 3 patients (21.4%). Four additional patients (28.6%) showed a significant decrease in HBV replication. In 4 cases, the disappearance of or decrease in HBV DNA was preceded by an increase in transaminase activities, which was also observed in one patient who did not modify his viral replication. Vaccination was otherwise uneventful. By contrast, during a mean follow-up of 40 months, only 3 (9%) of the 34 unvaccinated patients who served as controls lost serum HBV DNA, giving a 6-month HBV DNA disappearance rate of 1%. In sum, vaccination appeared able to reduce or stop HBV replication in half of the chronic HBsAg carriers with chronic hepatitis. This additional therapeutic tool may enhance the rate of response to interferon-alpha therapy, which is dependent on the level of HBV replication. Thus, immunotherapy should be considered of potential importance for the treatment of HBV infection."
8572,0.005,1.0000,"HIV infection is the major public health, social and economic problem in Georgia. The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of ARV treatment system in Georgia. Study included 1052 people living with HIV/AIDS in Georgia registered at Infectious Disease, AIDS and Clinical Immunology Research Center since 2004. To ensure universal access to ARV therapy all HIV/AIDS individuals included in the study were investigated by special algorithm, all identified patients requiring ARV therapy were offered treatment and monitored during therapy on treatment effectiveness and side effects. Detection of HIV antibodies was performed by ELISA with further confirmation by Western Blot Assay. HIV-1 RNA in plasma was measured by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction. For determination of percentages and absolute count of T lymphocyte subpopulations single-platform immunophenotyping technique using the Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer was applied. For resistance testing TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit with the OpenGene DNA Sequencing System (Siemens) was used. Treatment was offered to 595 HIV/AIDS patients. 594 patients started treatment, 1 patient refused. Out of treated 594 HIV/AIDS patients 22 patients discontinued, 111 patients died and 461 patients are currently on ARV treatment. Out of treated patients 406 adults and 21 children are receiving first-line treatment, 31 adults and 2 children are on second-line treatment and 1 adult is receiving salvage regimen. Treatment failure was defined in 55 cases. Among them immunological failure was observed in 7 cases, clinical failure in 1 case and virologic failure in 47 cases. Prevalence of drug resistance among virologic failure cases accounted for 72% and inadequate adherence for 28% cases. Majority of death cases among ARV treated patients was due to non-AIDS related or incurable conditions, while deaths due to AIDS related conditions mainly were associated to the delayed referral of patients in already advanced stage of disease. It's worth to mention that highest number of death cases was due to liver failure in HIV/HCV and/or HBV co-infected patients."

On admission, her vital signs were: pulse of 88, respiration rate of 18, temperature of 37.7 degrees C, and blood pressure of 126/76. Her only medication was phenytoin. On examination, the patient was found to have multiple umbilicated papules on her face, as well as painful, erythematous, large, punched-out ulcers on the nose, face, trunk, and extremities of 3 months' duration (Fig. 1). The borders of the ulcers were irregular, raised, boggy, and undermined, while the base contained hemorrhagic exudate partially covered with necrotic eschar. The largest ulcer on the left mandible was 4 cm in diameter. The oral cavity was clear. Because of her subtherapeutic phenytoin level, the medication dose was adjusted, and she was empirically treated with Unasyn for presumptive bacterial infection. Chest radiograph and head computed tomography (CT) scan were within normal limits. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear was negative. Serologic studies, including Histoplasma antibodies, toxoplasmosis immunoglobulin M (IgM), rapid plasma reagin (RPR), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies were all negative. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was within normal limits without the presence of cryptococcal antigen. Blood and cerebrospinal cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were all negative. Viral culture from one of the lesions was also negative. The analysis of her complete blood count showed: white blood count, 2300/microl; hemoglobin, 8.5 g/dL; hematocrit, 25.7%; and platelets, 114,000/microl. Two days after admission, the dermatology service was asked to evaluate the patient. Although the umbilicated papules on the patient's face resembled lesions of molluscum contagiosum, other infectious processes considered in the differential diagnosis included histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and Penicillium marnefei. In addition, the morphology of the ulcers, particularly that on the left mandible, resembled lesions of pyoderma gangrenosum. A skin biopsy was performed on an ulcer on the chest. Histopathologic examination revealed granulomatous dermatitis with multiple budding yeast forms, predominantly within histiocytes, with few organisms residing extracellularly. Methenamine silver stain confirmed the presence of 2-4 microm fungal spores suggestive of Histoplasma capsulatum (Fig. 2). Because of the patient's deteriorating condition, intravenous amphotericin B was initiated after tissue culture was obtained. Within the first week of treatment, the skin lesions started to resolve. Histoplasma capsulatum was later isolated by culture, confirming the diagnosis. The patient was continued on amphotericin B for a total of 10 weeks, and was started on lamivudine, stavudine, and nelfinavir for her HIV infection during hospitalization. After amphotericin B therapy, the patient was placed on life-long suppressive therapy with itraconazole. Follow-up at 9 months after the initial presentation revealed no evidence of relapse of histoplasmosis."
4875,0.005,1.0000,"The methionine-to-valine mutation in codon 184 (M184V) in reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) confers resistance to (-)-2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC; lamivudine) and increased sensitivity to 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (PMPA; tenofovir). We have used the SIV model to evaluate the effect of the M184V mutation on the emergence of resistance to the combination of 3TC plus PMPA. A site-directed mutant of SIVmac239 containing M184V (SIVmac239-184V) was used to select for resistance to both 3TC and PMPA by serial passage in the presence of increasing concentrations of both drugs. Under these selection conditions, the M184V mutation reverted in the majority of the selections. Variants resistant to both drugs were found to have the lysine-to-arginine mutation at codon 65 (K65R), which has previously been associated with resistance to PMPA in both SIV and HIV. Similarly, in rhesus macaques infected with SIVmac239-184V for 46 weeks and treated daily with (-)-2'-deoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine [(-)-FTC], there was no reversion of M184V, but this mutation reverted to 184 M in all three animals within 24 weeks of treatment with (-)-FTC and PMPA. Although the addition of PMPA to the (-)-FTC therapy induced a decrease in virus loads in plasma, these loads eventually returned to pre-PMPA levels in each case. All animals receiving this combination developed the K65R mutation. These results demonstrate that the combination of PMPA with 3TC or (-)-FTC selects for the K65R mutation and against the M184V mutation in SIV RT."
8619,0.005,1.0000,"Liver toxicity is a common side effect of antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs. We studied the differences in liver dysfunction observed during anti-TB treatment between hepatitis B virus carriers (HBV) and noncarriers. Three hundred twenty-four patients on anti-TB drugs were recruited and followed up for 1 year. Forty-three patients with HBV and 276 non-HBV patients were included for analysis. Liver function tests and viral markers were monitored monthly. Liver biopsy was requested whenever the alanine transaminase (ALT) was persistently abnormal. Eighty-six HBV carriers who were not given anti-TB drugs were chosen as a second control and evaluated prospectively. The incidence of liver dysfunction was significantly higher in HBV carriers given anti-TB drugs (34.9%) when compared to noncarriers (9.4%, P <.001) and with HBV carriers not given anti-TB drugs (8.1%, P <.001). For patients given anti-TB drugs, HBV carriers who developed liver dysfunction were younger (P =.011) and had more severe liver injury compared with noncarriers (P =.008). By multiple logistic regression analysis, age (P =.002) and hepatitis B infection (P <.001) were the only 2 significant risk factors for hepatotoxicity related to anti-TB therapy."
9294,0.005,1.0000,"The risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among asymptomatic hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers is not well understood. A community-based prospective study was conducted for over 8 years by record linkage to the Osaka Cancer Registry. The subjects were 1,927 individuals who were positive for anti-HCV through screening for second-generation HCV antibody (passive hemagglutination assay: >or= 2(12)) in voluntary blood donation. The risk factors for HCC and interaction between HCV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were evaluated by including additional blood donors: 2,519 individuals positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) alone, 25 positive for both anti-HCV and HBsAg, 150,379 negative for both anti-HCV and HBsAg. The incidence of HCC (/10(5) person-years) among the HCV-positive individuals increased with age in both genders, ranging from 68 to 1,306 among those aged 45-74 years. In the HCV-positive individuals, the cumulative risk of developing HCC between the ages of 40 and 74 year was 21.6% among males and 8.7% among females. A stepwise increase in risk was noted as the serum alanine aminotransferase level increased or serum cholesterol level at baseline decreased in multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. The 9-year cumulative incidence of HCC among individuals positive for HCV alone, those positive for HBsAg alone and those positive for both was 3.0%, 2.0% and 12.0%, respectively. The age-and-sex-adjusted rate ratio was 126, 102 and 572, respectively, when those negative for both were used as a reference. The results demonstrate an increased risk for HCC among asymptomatic HCV-positive individuals in Japan. Coinfection with HBV and HCV carried a superadditive risk for HCC."
2897,0.005,1.0000,"The outcome of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) referred for liver transplantation (LT) is unknown. A high frequency of lamivudine-resistant (LAM-R) HBV infection may increase the risk of liver-related death pre-transplantation and prophylaxis failure post-transplantation. We evaluated the association of LAM-R HBV on pre-transplant survival and post-transplant outcomes in 35 consecutive HIV-HBV coinfected patients referred for LT between July 2000 and September 2002. At the time of referral, the median CD4 count was 273/mm, MELD was 14, and LAM-R HBV infection was present in 67%. Among these referred patients, 26% were listed, 29% not listed due to relative/absolute contraindications; 26% not listed as too early for LT; 9% not listed as too sick for LT; and 11% died during transplant evaluation. Of the 9 listed patients, 4 remained listed, 1 died 18 months post-referral, and 4 were transplanted (11% of total) 3 to 40 months after listing. Of 17 evaluated but not listed patients, 5 died (p=0.38 compared to listed group) and all deaths were liver-related. All the HBV-HIV coinfected patients, who were transplanted, are HBsAg negative and have undetectable HBV DNA levels on prophylactic therapy using hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) plus lamivudine, with and without tenofovir or adefovir, with median 33.1 months follow-up. Late referral and the presence of LAM-R HBV pre-transplantation are common in referred HIV-HBV patients. In HIV-HBV coinfected patients undergoing LT, HBV recurrence is successfully prevented with combination prophylaxis using HBIG and antivirals."

This was a prospective cohort study of 239 consecutive HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with a new diagnosis of cirrhosis, done by TE, and no previous decompensation of liver disease. The time from diagnosis to the first liver decompensation and death from liver disease, as well as the predictors of these outcomes, were evaluated. After a median (Q1-Q3) follow-up of 20 (9-34) months, 31 (13%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 9%-17%) patients developed a decompensation. The incidence of decompensation was 6.7 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI, 4.7-9-6). Fourteen (8%) out of 181 patients with a baseline LS < 40 kPa developed a decompensation versus 17 (29%) out of 58 with LS ≥ 40 kPa (P = 0.001). Factors independently associated with decompensation were Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class B versus A (hazard ratio [HR] 7.7; 95% CI 3.3-18.5; P < 0.0001), log-plasma HCV RNA load (HR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2-3.6; P = 0.01), hepatitis B virus coinfection (HR, 10.3; 95% CI, 2.1-50.4; P = 0.004) and baseline LS (HR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.05; P = 0.02).

9828,0.005,1.0000,"Although antiviral prophylaxis is essential in hepatitis B patients in the context of cancer chemotherapy, there is little evidence-based consensus regarding the appropriate prevention strategy depending on the underlying type of cancer and viral status. This retrospective study included a comprehensive cohort of 302 hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients with various cancers undergoing chemotherapy and antiviral prophylaxis. The rates of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation during antiviral therapy (>1 log10 IU/mL increase or positive conversion of serum HBV DNA) and relapse when off antivirals ([re]appearance of HBV DNA >2,000 IU/ml with related alanine aminotransferase elevation) were evaluated, together with the associated risk factors, in a competing risks analysis where cancer death was considered as the competing event. During antiviral prophylaxis, HBV was reactivated in six patients (1.9%), who had leukemia (n = 4) or lymphoma (n = 2) and were treated with lamivudine (n = 4) or entecavir (n = 2). The incidence rate of HBV relapse in 127 off-prophylaxis patients was 21.3% during a median post-antiviral period of 11.7 months. Lymphoma, pre-prophylactic HBV DNA ≥2,000 IU/ml, and age ≥50 years were independent predictors of off-treatment HBV relapse (adjusted hazard ratios 5.25, 3.07, and 0.34, respectively; Ps < 0.05). Antiviral and anticancer drugs, duration of consolidation on antiviral prophylaxis, and HBeAg positivity were not independent predictors. In conclusion, hepatitis B flare-ups are not rare in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy during and after anti-HBV prophylaxis, even when potent antivirals are used. Patients with hematopoietic or lymphoid neoplasms or high viral burdens should receive prolonged and powerful HBV prophylaxis. J. Med. Virol. 88:1576-1586, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
7638,0.005,1.0000,"Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) is the most common cause of focal deficits in patients living with HIV/AIDS. Among 257 HIV-infected adult patients seen between January 2006 and December 2010 in a tertiary hospital in Zaria, northern Nigeria, 9 (3.5%) patients had clinical, serological, and brain imaging evidence of TE. All 9 patients had CD4 count of less than 50 cells/mm(3). Of the 9 patients, 7 were antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive, while 2 were cases of ART-induced TE-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. After administering intravenous dexamethasone for cerebral decompression and specific antitoxoplasma therapy, symptoms and signs resolved in 8 patients within 4 to 14 days, but 1 patient died. Our data suggest that even in the ART era in Nigeria, TE remains a fairly common cause of morbidity among HIV-infected patients due to late HIV diagnosis and significant immunosuppression at diagnosis. Early HIV diagnosis, early initiation of highly active ART, and routine prophylaxis against TE are imperative in combating the challenge of HIV/AIDS-related TE in Nigeria. "
8196,0.005,1.0000,"Association between isolated hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been noted in HIV-infected individuals. This study describes the frequency of isolated anti-HBc and its possible value for the detection of HBV-DNA in HIV-infected patients with or without HCV co-infection. Ninety-two HIV-infected patients were enrolled in the study. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag), anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, HIV viral load and CD4 count were tested in all subjects. Then we compared 63 subjects with HIV-HCV co-infection with 29 subjects with HIV infection alone regarding isolated anti-HBc (HBs Ag negative, anti-HBs negative and anti-HBc positive). The presence of HBV-DNA was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction in serum samples of patients with isolated anti-HBc. Of 63 anti-HCV-positive patients, 18 subjects (28.6%, 95% [confidence interval] CI: 22.6-34.6%), and of 29 anti-HCV-negative patients, five subjects (17.2%, 95% CI: 11.5-22.9%) had isolated anti-HBc. HBV-DNA was detectable in three of 18 anti-HCV-positive patients (16.7%, 95% CI: 9.7-23.7%) and none of the anti-HCV-negative patients with isolated anti-HBc. Our study showed that individuals co-infected with HIV and HCV were more likely to have isolated anti-HBc than subjects with HIV alone. This investigation also demonstrates that the presence of isolated anti-HBc in HIV-HCV-infected individuals may reflect occult HBV infection in these patients."
6182,0.005,1.0000,"Despite a decade of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity, a few individuals termed as long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs) maintain a stable CD4+ T-cell count for a period of time. The aim of this study was to establish, through the sequential determination of all known predictors of HIV disease, the proportion of such patients having stringent criteria of true long-term nonprogression. Among 249 individuals who were HIV-infected and prospectively followed up over a 10-year period (1985 to 1995), 12 having a CD4+ T-cell count greater than 500/microL (LTNP I group) and 9 having a CD4+ T-cell count less than 500 but stable over time (LTNP II group) after at least 10 years of infection without intervention of antiviral therapy, were studied over the entire follow-up period. The plasma HIV RNA copy number and the serum concentrations of p24 antigen, each anti-HIV antibody, neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin, Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA were determined every 18 months over the study period. Cellular and plasma viremias were cross-sectionaly assayed in all 21 patients. Only two patients had strictly no marker of progression over the follow-up period. They were the only ones who had, over the 10-year period, a viral copy number too low to be detected. The other patients had a viral copy number higher than 400/mL at at least one visit and increasing over the follow-up period, and they evidenced one or more markers of virological or immunological deterioration. Cellular viremia was positive in all patients but two, while plasma viremia was negative in all but one. The population of individuals termed as LTNPs is not virologically and immunologically homogeneous. The majority present biological signs of HIV disease progression. A new pattern of true LTNP can be drawn through stringent criteria based on the whole known predictors. This pattern appears to be rare in HIV-positive population."
1260,0.005,1.0000,"From July 1984 to December 1996, we tested and studied 303 haemophilic patients for the infection of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Among the 261 haemophilia A patients 44 were HIV positive (16.9%), while none of the haemophilia B patients was HIV positive. The mean age of the 44 HIV-seropositive patients in 1984 was 20.6 years (2-37 years). Seven who had known seroconversion dates and 29 whose first seropositive dates were known seroconverted before 1986. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has developed in 16 patients, nine of whom presented with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, three with tuberculosis infection, and 13 had died. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the progression rate to AIDS after the date of first seropositive test is about 30% at the 10th year. The median survival time after development of AIDS obtained from the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival curve was 11.7 months. Statistical analysis for the covariate effects on the risk of developing AIDS by the Cox proportional hazards model revealed that there was a statistically significant negative association of the risk for progression to AIDS with the logarithm of initial CD4 cell counts (P = 0.027) and the rate of decline of CD4 cell counts (P = 0.040), but not with age (P = 0.650). In conclusion, the clinical characteristics of AIDS haemophiliacs in Taiwan were not different from that observed in western countries. Low initial CD4 cell count and sharp decline in CD4 cell counts, but not age, increased the risk of progression to AIDS."
6180,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the efficient HIV-1 replication blockage achieved with current highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) therapies, HIV-1 persists in the body and survives in a latent state that can last for the entire life of the patient. A long-lived reservoir of latently infected CD4(+) memory T cells represents the most important sanctuary for the virus and the greatest obstacle for viral eradication. In this work, we present an initial step toward a gene therapy approach aimed at the activation of latent provirus to induce the death of latently infected T cells. Latent HIV-1 infection is characterized by the failure of viral gene expression as a consequence of uninitiated or aborted transcription. We have constructed an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector (p5p53RTAT3) that expresses the viral trans-activating protein Tat in a drug-regulated manner and p53 in a Rev-dependent manner. We have demonstrated that the Tat-expressed protein from p5p53RTAT3 vector reactivates latent HIV-1 proviruses in J1.1 and ACH-2 cell lines and promotes p53-induced apoptosis in the presence of Rev. Our system was able to trigger the trans-activation of the provirus 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), stimulate the expression of the Rev protein from a tat-defective provirus, and provoke apoptosis selectively in the cells transfected with a tat-defective HIV-1 provirus in contrast to those with no HIV-1 provirus. However, the Rev-dependent p53 killing of latently infected cells was not effective enough for complete elimination of the awakened HIV-1 viruses. In summary, we have developed a vector system that is efficient in activating latent HIV-1 proviruses but that needs further improvement to kill infected cells."

In this study semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is compared with a new branched DNA signal amplification methodology. Samples from HCV-infected patients as well as from human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients were evaluated. Reverse transcriptase PCR correlated well with the branched DNA assay (r = 0.7036, P < 0.05). HCV RNA was found to occur at significantly higher titers (P < 0.05) in patients coinfected with the human immunodeficiency virus compared with titers in those infected with HCV alone. Immune status as defined by the CD4+ count was not associated with the observed difference in viral titer."

A cross-sectional study was performed from September 2014 to February 2015 in 67 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive (HIV+) and 37 HIV-seronegative (HIV-) patients. Blood collected from these patients was used to perform cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) lymphocyte blood counts and a white blood cell count, as well as to measure C-reactive protein (CRP) blood by flow cytometry and perform optical and immuno-turbidimetric detection. Enteric bacteria were isolated from the stool of patients, and their antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined using agar diffusion methods. The results showed that Escherichia coli was the main pathogenic bacteria in the digestive tracts of HIV+ (85.3%) and HIV- (81.1%) patients, and infections with Klebsiella sp. were also predominant among HIV- patients (29.4%). Resistance of Klebsiella sp. to ceftriaxone (CRO; P=0.001), gentamicin (GEN; P=0.005), chloramphenicol (CHL; P=0.0004), ciprofloxacin (CIP; P=0.005) and doxycycline (DOX; P<0.0001) was significantly higher in HIV+ patients than in HIV- patients. Enterobacter sp. showed high resistance to GEN (P=0.009) and CIP (P=0.001) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Citrobacter sp. was resistant to GEN (P=0.009) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Salmonella sp. showed high resistance to CHL (P<0.0001) and DOX (P<0.0001) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Resistance of Serratia sp. to AMO (P=0.005), AMC (P=0.005) and CHL (P=0.005) was significantly higher in HIV+ patients than in HIV- patients. Lymphopenia was higher in HIV+ patients (36.8%) than in HIV- patients (2.7%). In 45.9% of the HIV- patients, the CRP rate was higher than 6mg/L compared to 16.2% in HIV+ patients. In general, bacterial multi-drug resistance in HIV+ patients (79.4%) was significantly higher (P<0.0001) than in HIV- patients (29.7%). The present study revealed that the resistance profiles of bacteria should be considered in HIV-infected patients to improve their health care."
3456,0.005,1.0000,"The natural history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has never been studied according to the concept of liver fibrosis progression. The aim of this work was to assess the fibrosis progression rate in HIV-HCV coinfected patients and in patients infected by HCV only. A cohort of 122 HIV-HCV coinfected patients was compared with a control group of 122 HIV-negative HCV-infected patients. Groups were matched according to age, sex, daily alcohol consumption, age at HCV infection, and duration and route of HCV infection. The fibrosis progression rate was defined as the ratio between fibrosis stage (METAVIR scoring system) and the HCV duration. The prevalence of extensive liver fibrosis (METAVIR fibrosis scores 2, 3, and 4) and moderate or severe activity were higher in HIV-infected patients (60% and 54%, respectively) than in control patients (47% and 30%, respectively; P <.05 and P <.001, respectively). The median fibrosis progression rate in coinfected patients and in control patients was 0.153 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.117-0.181) and 0.106 (95% CI, 0.084-0.125) fibrosis units per year, respectively (P <.0001). HIV seropositivity (P <.0001), alcohol consumption (>50 g/d, P =.0002), age at HCV infection (<25 years old, P <.0001), and severe immunosuppression (CD4 count </=200 cells/microL, P <.0001) were associated with an increase in the fibrosis progression rate. In coinfected patients, alcohol consumption (>50 g/d), CD4 count (</=200 cells/microL), and age at HCV infection (<25 years old) (P <. 0001, respectively) were associated with a higher fibrosis progression rate. HIV seropositivity accelerates HCV-related liver fibrosis progression. In coinfected patients, a low CD4 count, alcohol consumption rate, and age at HCV infection are associated with a higher liver fibrosis progression rate."
5021,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between the neurological manifestations of HIV infection, CD4+ lymphocyte count and the levels of HIV-1 RNA (viral load) in plasma. A total of 62 adult antiretroviral naïve HIV infected patients were enrolled in the study. Among them 26 had neurological complications of HIV infection (1st group), 16 patients had symptomatic disease without neurological involvements (2nd group) and 20 were asymptomatic patients (control group). Measurement of CD4 count was performed by indirect immunofluorescent assay by using the monoclonal antibodies and viral load (VL) in plasma--by RT PCR method. CD4 count was significantly lower in the 1st and 2nd group compared to the control group. There was correlation between the level of CD4 count and type of neurological manifestation. VL was comparable between the 1st and 2nd groups and was higher than in control group. There is a significant correlation between the level of CD4 count and type of neurological manifestation of HIV infection. Presence of neurological complication as well as other clinical manifestations is associated with decreased CD4 count and increased VL. Level of CD4 count can serve as an indicator for initiation of prophylaxis treatment of certain opportunistic pathogens."
8993,0.005,1.0000,"Mortality data of patients, classified according to their clinical status and CD4+ cell count status, would be very useful to guide clinicians to prioritizing patients who need antiretroviral drug therapy. In the current study, the authors re-analyzed data derived from a previously published retrospective study of HIV-1-infected individuals at Lampang Hospital in northern Thailand. According to the Cox proportional hazard model, compared to asymptomatic patients with a high CD4+ cell count (> 200 cell/microl), the mortality rate of asymptomatic patients with a medium CD4+ cell count (100-199 cell/microl) did not significantly differ. However, the mortality rate of patients with a CD4+ cell count below 100 cell/microl was at least 16 times higher, regardless of the presence of clinical symptoms. Based on these results, the authors produced a Lampang Hospital guideline of antiretroviral drug use; priority of antiretroviral therapy should, therefore, be given to patients with CD4+ cell count < 100 cell/microl."
1274,0.005,1.0000,"The rapid scale-up of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and use of single dose Nevirapine (SD NVP) for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (pMTCT) have raised fears about the emergence of resistance to the first line antiretroviral drug regimens. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of primary drug resistance (PDR) in a cohort of young (<25 yrs) HAART-naïve HIV pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe. Whole blood was collected in EDTA for CD4 counts, viral load, serological estimation of duration of infection using the BED Calypte assay and genotyping for drug resistance. Four hundred and seventy-one women, mean age 21 years; SD: 2.1 were enrolled into the study between 2006 and 2007. Their median CD4 count was 371cells/µL; IQR: 255-511 cells/µL. Two hundred and thirty-six samples were genotyped for drug resistance. Based on the BED assay, 27% were recently infected (RI) whilst 73% had long-term infection (LTI). Median CD4 count was higher (p<0.05) in RI than in women with LTI. Only 2 women had drug resistance mutations; protease I85V and reverse transcriptase Y181C. Prevalence of PDR in Chitungwiza, 4 years after commencement of the national ART program remained below WHO threshold limit (5%). Frequency of recent infection BED testing is consistent with high HIV acquisition during pregnancy. With the scale-up of long-term ART programs, maintenance of proper prescribing practices, continuous monitoring of patients and reinforcement of adherence may prevent the acquisition and transmission of PDR."
1768,0.005,1.0000,"The influence of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) upon hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine responses in HIV-infected individuals is unclear. After classification of vaccinees as non-responders (HBsAb <10IU/L) or responders (HBsAb >or=10IU/L) in our HIV cohort, multivariate logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with subsequent vaccine response. Of 626 participants vaccinated from 1988 to 2005, 217 (35%) were vaccine responders. Receipt of >or=3 doses of vaccine (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.24-2.70), higher CD4 count at vaccination (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.13 per 50 cells/microl increase), and use of HAART (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.56-3.62) were all associated with increased likelihood of developing a response. However, only 49% of those on HAART at last vaccination responded, and 62% of those on HAART, with CD4 count >or=350, and HIV RNA <400 copies/mL responded. Compared to those on HAART with CD4 count >or=350, those not on HAART with CD4 count >or=350 had significantly reduced odds of developing a vaccine response (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.70). While HAART use concurrent with HBV immunization was associated with increased probability of responding to the vaccine, the response rate was low for those on HAART. These data provide additional evidence of HAART benefits, even in those with higher CD4 counts, but also highlight the need for improving HBV vaccine immunogenicity."

In HIV-infected patients, the management of PAH is challenging given the potential drug interactions between PAH-specific vasodilators and antiretroviral drugs. We describe a 51-year-old female with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-associated PAH. She was treated with the oral endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan while taking a nevirapine (a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor)-based antiretroviral regimen. Due to concerns about potential drug interactions with the antiretroviral therapy, her nevirapine plasma concentration, as well as CD4(+) cell count and viral load, were continuously monitored. We observed no interaction between bosentan and nevirapine during a 4-year period. To our knowledge, this report is the first to demonstrate successful, long-term coadministration of bosentan and a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor."
6407,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects have increased levels of oxidative stress which could impair immunological function and therefore contribute to the progression of AIDS. These characteristics are usually evaluated at rest and responses to exercise have yet to be evaluated. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of a bout of aerobic exercise followed by resistance exercises on antioxidant system in HIV-infected and non-HIV subjects. There were included 14 cases (HIV-positive) and 14 controls (HIV-negative). The exercise protocol consisted of a single session of 20 minutes on a cycloergometer followed by a set of six resistance exercises. The activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase were measured in plasma samples, total glutathione (TGSH) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured in erythrocytes. T CD4+ cells, T CD8+, viral load, complete blood count, and white blood count were also assessed. All measurements were performed at three times: baseline, after aerobic exercise, and after resistance exercises. At baseline, the HIV group had lower GST activity than controls, but after the exercise session GST values were similar in both groups. Compared to the control group TGSH was significantly lower in the HIV group at baseline, after aerobic and resistance exercises. The control group presented higher TBARS values after aerobic exercise compared to the HIV group. The neutrophil count was lower in the HIV group after aerobic and resistance exercises. These data indicate that HIV-infected subjects had lower antioxidant activity at rest. Physical exercise stimulated the enzymatic activity similarly in both groups."
9524,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-specific CD4+ T-helper cell responses in 40 subjects with chronic infection (CI) who had virus suppression after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were compared with those in 34 subjects treated during primary infection (PI). A CD4+ T-cell proliferative response to HIV p24 protein was present in 50% of these subjects compared with 79% of subjects treated during PI. The existence of a proliferative response in CI subjects was associated with a higher CD4+ T-cell count at initiation of HAART, a longer duration of virus suppression, and a higher CD4+ T-cell count at the time of analysis. These results show that an HIV-specific proliferative response is preferentially observed in treated CI subjects with CD4+ T-cell counts of >200/microL. However, in treated CI subjects with a significant degree of CD4+ T-cell depletion (<200/microL), it may also be observed in 35% provided that the duration of virus suppression is long enough, which may have implications for future therapeutic strategies."
9989,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global public health challenge, with an estimated 1.4 million patients worldwide. Co-infection with HIV leads to challenges in both the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Further, there has been an increase in rates of drug resistant tuberculosis, including multi-drug (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDRTB), which are difficult to treat and contribute to increased mortality. Because of the poor performance of sputum smear microscopy in HIV-infected patients, newer diagnostic tests are urgently required that are not only sensitive and specific but easy to use in remote and resource-constrained settings. The treatment of co-infected patients requires antituberculosis and antiretroviral drugs to be administered concomitantly; challenges include pill burden and patient compliance, drug interactions, overlapping toxic effects, and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Also important questions about the duration and schedule of anti-TB drug regimens and timing of antiretroviral therapy remain unanswered. From a programmatic point of view, screening of all HIV-infected persons for TB and vice-versa requires good co-ordination and communication between the TB and AIDS control programmes. Linkage of co-infected patients to antiretroviral treatment centres is critical if early mortality is to be prevented. We present here an overview of existing diagnostic strategies, new tests in the pipeline and recommendations for treatment of patients with HIV-TB dual infection."
6351,0.005,1.0000,"The intersection and syndemic interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics have global prevalence with devastating morbidity and massive mortality. Using FDG-PET imaging it was shown that in HIV-infected individuals, involvement of the head and neck precedes that of the chest and of the abdomen. The sequence of lymph node involvement observed suggests the existence of a diffusible activation mediator that may be targeted via therapeutic intervention strategies. Furthermore, the degree of FDG uptake proved directly related to viral load and inversely related to CD4 cell count. Available data in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining cancers further suggest that FDG-PET/CT imaging may be useful for prognostication of cervical cancer and for identifying appropriate sites for biopsy, staging, and monitoring lymphoproliferative activity owing to HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma and multicentric Castleman disease. Inversely, in HIV-associated lymphoma, FDG uptake in HIV-involved lymphoid tissue was shown to reduce the specificity of FDG-PET imaging findings, the effect of which in clinical practice warrants further investigation. In the latter setting, knowledge of viremia appears to be essential for FDG-PET image interpretation. Early HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, formerly known as AIDS dementia complex, proved to be characterized by striatal hypermetabolism and progressive HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder or AIDS dementia complex by a decrease in subcortical and cortical metabolism. In lipodystrophic HIV-infected individuals, lipodystrophy proved associated with increased glucose uptake by adipose tissue, likely resulting from the metabolic stress of adipose tissue in response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Furthermore, ongoing chronic low-grade infection in arteries of HIV-infected individuals could be depicted by FDG-PET/CT imaging. And there is promising data that FDG-PET/CT in HIV may serve as a new marker for the evaluation of thymic function in HIV-infected patients. In the setting of TB, FDG-PET has proven unable to differentiate malignancy from TB in patients presenting with solitary pulmonary nodules, including those suffering from HIV, and thus cannot be used as a tool to reduce futile biopsy or thoracotomy in these patients. In patients presenting with extrapulmonary TB, FDG-PET imaging was found to be significantly more efficient when compared with CT for the identification of more sites of involvement. Thus supporting that FDG-PET/CT can demonstrate lesion extent, serve as guide for biopsy with aspiration for culture, assist surgery planning and contribute to follow-up. Limited available data suggest that quantitative FDG-PET findings may allow for prediction or rapid assessment, at 4 months following treatment instigation, of response to antituberculostatics in TB-infected HIV patients. These results and more recent findings suggest a role for FDG-PET/CT imaging in the evaluation of therapeutic response in TB patients. "
78,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the increasing prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease in the population and the increasing likelihood that HIV-positive (HIV+) patients may have an extraction, little is known about the risk of postoperative complications in this group. The goal of this investigation was to assess the risk of postoperative complications in HIV+ patients after tooth extraction. The study was designed as a retrospective cohort study with a sample consisting of 145 males who underwent tooth extraction. The patients' medical and dental records were reviewed to identify HIV serostatus, to document the frequency and type of postoperative complications, and to collect data on potential confounding variables. Forty-four patients were identified as HIV+. The postoperative complication rate in HIV+ patients was 20.9% and for HIV-negative (HIV-) patients 2.9% (relative risk = 7.0, 95% confidence interval = 2.0-25.0, P = 0.001). Furthermore, as the manifestations of the symptoms of HIV infection became more severe, the postextraction complication rate also increased (P = 0.008). The results of this study suggest that HIV+ patients have an increased risk of postextraction complications and as the level of HIV disease increases, the risk of complications also increases. While the findings of this study are consistent with studies based on case series, prospective cohort studies are required to confirm the findings."
7497,0.005,1.0000,"To estimate the prevalence and identify factors associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among men and women in Karachi, Pakistan. We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult men and women in a peri-urban community of Karachi (Jam Kandah). Households were selected through systematic sampling from within all villages in the study area. All available adults within each household were interviewed about potential HCV risk factors. A blood specimen was collected to test for anti-HCV antibodies by enzyme immunoassay. We used generalized estimating equations while accounting for correlation of responses within villages to identify the factors associated with HCV infection. Of 1997 participants, 476 (23.8%) were anti-HCV positive. Overall, HCV infection was significantly associated with increasing age, ethnicity, and having received > or =2 blood transfusions, > or =3 hospitalizations, dental treatment and >5 injections among women. Among women, > or =2 blood transfusions [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.32], >5 injections during the past 6 months (aORs = 1.47), dental treatment (aOR = 1.31) and increasing age(aOR = 1.49), while among men, extramarital sexual intercourse (aOR = 2.77), at least once a week shave from barber (aOR = 5.04), > or =3 hospitalizations (aOR = 2.50) and increasing age (aOR = 1.28) were associated with HCV infection. A very high prevalence of HCV was found in the study population. Among women, unsafe health care practices, while among men extramarital sex, shaving from a barber and hospitalizations were associated with HCV infection. Efforts are needed to improve the safety of medical procedures to reduce the transmission of HCV in Pakistan [Corrections made in Summary after initial online publication.]."
3289,0.005,1.0000,"There are sparse epidemiologic data on coinfection of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) in the United States. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of HBV coinfection in a large U.S. population of HCV patients. We used the National Veterans Affairs HCV Clinical Case Registry to identify patients tested for HCV during 1997-2005. Patients were categorized based on HCV exposure (any two +HCV tests or one test with a diagnostic code), HCV infection (+RNA or genotype), HBV exposure (any +HBV test, excluding +HBsAb only), and HBV infection (+HBsAg, HBV DNA, or HBeAg). The prevalence of HBV exposure among patients with HCV exposure and that of HBV infection among patients with HCV infection were determined. Multivariate logistic regression evaluated potential demographic and clinical predictors of HBV coinfection. Among 168,239 patients with HCV exposure, 58,415 patients had HBV exposure for a prevalence of 34.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34.5-35.0). Among 102,971 patients with HCV infection, 1,431 patients had HBV coinfection for a prevalence of 1.4% (95% CI 1.3-1.5). Independent associations with HBV coinfection compared with HCV monoinfection were age ≤ 50 years, male sex, positive HIV status, history of hemophilia, sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, history of blood transfusion, cocaine and other drug use; there was decreased risk in patients of Hispanic ethnicity."

After 48 weeks of treatment, HCV-coinfected patients had lower increases in CD4% (P = .05), total CD4+ (P = .01), and naïve CD4+ (P = .06) T cells than did single-infected subjects. Higher baseline naïve CD4+ T-cell levels were associated with better CD4+ (P = .05) and naïve CD4+ (P < .001) T-cell recovery. After a 4-year follow up, the differences disappeared (median CD4+ increase: 291 and 306 cells for HCV-positive and HCV-negative patients, respectively, P = .9). No significant differences were seen in memory CD4+ T cells (P = .30), and CD8+ cells expressing CD38 (P = .10) and CD28 (P = .73). These results suggest that, independently of other factors, infection with HCV blunts early CD4+ T-cell recovery in HIV-infected patients treated with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, as good control of viral replication is maintained, satisfactory long-term immune restoration can nonetheless be achieved."

The aim of this study was to identify epidemiological patterns and risk factors of HBV and HDV infections in Barcelos, in the basin of the Negro river. A random sample (798 in all) of the total population in the urban area and in 2 rural villages was surveyed. A standardized questionnaire was used and blood samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: 1.63% had hepatitis B surface antigen, 12.9% had anti-hepatitis B surface antibody and 21.4% had anti-hepatitis B core antigen. The overall prevalence of HBV infection was 24.6%. Anti-hepatitis D was present in 5 subjects, all of them non-natives, and hepatitis B e antigen in 2. A positive association between history of dental treatment with an unqualified dental surgeon was found (P < 0.05). These results suggest a low prevalence of HVB and HDV infection, in contrast with other parts of the Amazon area."

We report a treatment-naïve male with chronic HIV-1 infection who presented with an axonal variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Antiretroviral therapy commenced one month later and no rapid improvement or deterioration of tetraparesis was noted. This is the first report that describes the detection and serial measurements of anti-ganglioside antibody in a patient with HIV infection. This case suggests a limited role for T-cell immunity in the production of anti-ganglioside antibody and the pathogenesis of axonal variants, since the antiretroviral therapy-induced improvement in T-cell immunity neither re-elevated anti-ganglioside antibody titer nor worsened tetraparesis."

At baseline, HIV prevalence was 25.3%, and HCV prevalence was 54.5%. Seropositive persons with prevalent HIV infection were used to estimate baseline HIV incidence by means of the Calypte HIV-1 BED Incidence EIA (Calypte Biomedical Corporation, Portland, Oregon). Longitudinal HIV and HCV incidence were measured among 865 HIV-negative IDUs and 519 HCV antibody-negative IDUs followed semiannually for 2 years. Participants received pre- and posttest risk reduction counseling at each visit. Estimated HIV incidence at baseline was 2.95 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21, 4.69) by BED assay; observed HIV incidence over 1,262 person-years was 0.48 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.17, 1.03). HCV incidence over 645 person-years was 1.71 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.85, 3.03). Self-reported risk behaviors declined significantly over time, from 100% of participants reporting drug injection at baseline to 11% at 24 months. In this cohort with high HIV and HCV prevalence at enrollment, the authors observed low incidence and declining self-reported risk behavior over time. While no formal intervention was administered, these findings highlight the potential impact of voluntary counseling and testing in a high-risk cohort."
3134,0.005,1.0000,"As a result of shared modes of transmission, chronic hepatitis C infection is common in HIV-infected patients, particularly among those who have used injection drugs as well as men who have sex with men (MSMs). In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, HCV infection has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Over the last decade, treatment with peginterferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) has been recommended for coinfected patients who are at the greatest risk for liver disease; however, the effectiveness of HCV treatment in this population has been disappointing. Challenges to the use of HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, patients with HIV/HCV coinfection include the potential for interactions between different drugs, addition of drug toxicities, and the need for therapy with PEG-IFN. Despite these challenges, limited data indicate that telaprevir and boceprevir given in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV increase the rate of viral suppression in coinfected patients with manageable toxicity and drug-drug interaction profile. Accordingly, these agents may be recommended for HCV treatment in carefully selected HIV-infected persons."
2340,0.005,1.0000,"The ability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to prevent the onset of HIV-associated dementia and to prevent or reduce the neuropathological features of HIV encephalitis (HIVE) remains unclear. Using a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model of HIVE, we determined the effects of regular HAART treatment on HIVE. Before studying HAART in infected SCID mice, nonmanipulated SCID mice were treated with a single injection of the HAART cocktail (consisting of zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir) to determine optimum dosage and sampling time and to measure antiretroviral levels in the brain. After these preliminary studies, SCID mice that were inoculated with either HIV-infected or uninfected human monocytes were given intraperitoneal (IP) injections of HAART three times daily over a 1- and 2-week period. All three drugs were detected in the brain using a novel drug extraction technique and a modified high-performance liquid chromatography method. HAART significantly decreased the amount of astrogliosis and viral load in treated mice compared with mice that received vehicle injections. These studies offer insight into the ability of HAART to treat HIV infection of the brain."
9487,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is one of the most prominent health care challenges world wide. In Western industrialized countries where common access to antiretroviral drugs exists, HIV infection is a well treatable disease in the long-term for most patients. However, given the possible evolution of drug-resistance, the right combination of antiretroviral drugs in first-line therapy is crucial for maintaining long-term success. For each individual patient, the ideal time to start antiretroviral therapy must be carefully selected. The individual risk of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on the one hand, and the risks of long-term toxicity and adherence problems under therapy on the other hand must be taken into account. Each patient should be counseled according to present treatment guidelines on when and how to start HAART, taking into account the surrogate markers CD4-cell count and HIV-RNA as well as clinically apparent HIV-associated disease."
2102,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive individuals who adhere to their antiretroviral (ARV) regimens are more likely to achieve suppressed HIV viral load and improved immunologic response; however, for most patients, medication adherence remains a challenge. Prior studies have shown that clinical pharmacists contribute to the management of HIV-infected patients; but due to variability in clinical responsibilities and study limitations, their value has not been fully realized. The objective of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes of an HIV clinical pharmacist's interventions at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, who utilizes medication expertise to provide recommendations for ARV regimen changes. The pharmacist suggests new ARV regimens in order to attain virologic suppression, improve immunologic response, or minimize ARV adverse effects, while aiming to optimize patients' adherence by decreasing pill burden and/or dosing frequency. This retrospective study assessed the effectiveness of the pharmacist's interventions that occurred between 11 September 2006 and 30 September 2008 on pill burden, dosing frequency, and medication adherence. Additionally, CD4+ cell count and HIV viral load pre- and post-intervention were evaluated. Medication adherence was assessed utilizing electronic pharmacy refill records and calculated based on the formula: [(pills dispensed/pills prescribed per day)/days between refills] x 100. From a cohort of 75 patients, mean daily pill quantity and dosing frequency decreased from 7.2 pills/day and 2.0 times/day in the control phase to 5.4 pills/day and 1.5 times/day in the study phase, respectively ( p < 0.001). Medication adherence increased from a mean of 81% in the control phase to 89% in the study phase ( p = 0.003). Clinical outcomes measured by CD4+cell count and CD4% were statistically improved and more individuals achieved undetectable HIV viral loads postintervention ( p < 0.001). In conclusion, HIV clinical pharmacists may play an important role in reducing pill burden and dosing frequency, increasing medication adherence, and improving clinical outcomes."
3509,0.005,1.0000,"There are approximately 240 million patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection worldwide. Up to 40% of HBV-infected patients can progress to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or chronic end-stage liver disease during their lifetime. This, in turn, is responsible for around 650000 deaths annually worldwide. Repeated hepatitis flares may increase the progression of liver fibrosis, making the accurate diagnosis of the stage of liver fibrosis critical in order to make antiviral therapeutic decisions for HBV-infected patients. Liver biopsy remains the ""gold standard"" for diagnosing liver fibrosis. However, this technique has recently been challenged by the development of several novel noninvasive tests to evaluate liver fibrosis, including serum markers, combined models and imaging techniques. In addition, the cost and accessibility of imaging techniques have been suggested as additional limitations for invasive assessment of liver fibrosis in developing countries. Therefore, a noninvasive assessment model has been suggested to evaluate liver fibrosis, specifically in HBV-infected patients, owing to its high applicability, inter-laboratory reproducibility, wide availability for repeated assays and reasonable cost. The current review aims to present the status of knowledge in this new and exciting field, and to highlight the key points in HBV-infected patients for clinicians. "
1083,0.005,1.0000,"Although therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection has delivered remarkable cure rates, curative therapies for hepatitis B virus (HBV) may only be available in the distant future. The possibility to eliminate or at least stably maintain low levels of HBV replication under the control of a functional anti-host response has stimulated the development of specific immunotherapies for HBV infection. We reviewed the development of T-cell therapy for HBV, highlighting its potential antiviral efficiency but also its potential toxicities in different groups of chronic HBV patients. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are the only two communicable diseases in which there have been increases in related morbidity and mortality over the past 20 years [1]. Both viruses are chronically infecting about 500 million people (HBV ~350 million, HCV ~150 million) and represent the seventh most frequent cause of death worldwide [1]. HBV and HCV are hepatotropic, non-cytopathic viruses able to establish persistent infections that cause different degrees of hepatic inflammation (chronic hepatitis), leading to the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The two viruses are unrelated and virologically different. HCV remains prevalent in North America and Europe, whereas chronic hepatitis B is prevalent in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [1,2]. HCV is an RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, and HBV is a DNA virus of the Hepadnaviridae family and uses reverse transcriptase to synthesize its DNA from a pre-genomic RNA form [3]. HCV is able to activate in the infected host a classical type I interferon (IFN)-mediated innate response [3], whereas HBV generally escapes innate immune recognition and does not activate type I IFN-mediated immunity. Chronic HBV and HCV infections are both characterized by quantitative and functional defects of virus-specific T-cell response [4,5]. The frequency of virus-specific T cells is extremely low, and virus-specific T cells show features of exhaustion in both chronic HBV and HCV patients [6]. However, the quantitative and functional defects are more pronounced in HBV infections, with T cells virtually undetectable in the blood of many chronic HBV patients by ex vivo analysis [7-9]. In addition, while frequency and impact of viral mutations in T cell epitopes are frequently detectable in HCV infections [10], viral mutations affecting CD8 T-cell epitopes are scarcer in chronic HBV patients [6,11,12]. Of extreme practical importance in relation to the potential impact of T-cell therapy for HBV and HCV are the efficacies of currently available treatments. New therapies for HCV have delivered remarkable cure rates, with more than 90% of patients achieving viral clearance with all oral direct-acting antivirals [13]. In contrast, curative therapies for HBV will not be available until the distant future (14). Thus, although it is difficult to see a possible therapeutic advantage of a new T-cell-based therapy in chronic HCV patients, the fact that current therapies for HBV only partially suppress but do not eliminate HBV from the infected host has encouraged research for new and more radical therapies designed to eliminate or at least stably maintain low levels of HBV replication under the control of a functional anti-host response. For these reasons, in this review, we concentrate on the development of T-cell therapy for HBV. T-cell therapy for HCV chronic infection is certainly important for understanding the mechanisms of T-cell antiviral control [15,16], but their use for therapy appears unlikely."
4606,0.005,1.0000,"Worldwide viral hepatitis is the most common cause of jaundice, chronic liver disease cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. While important advances have been made in prevention of viral hepatitis, therapy of this disease remains unsatisfactory. There are no specific therapies of proven benefit for acute hepatitis, although use of alpha-interferon during the acute phase of hepatitis C may result in a decrease in the rate of chronicity. For chronic viral hepatitis, alpha-interferon has been widely used, but is expensive, poorly tolerated and limited in effectiveness. New antiviral agents and use of combinations of antivirals are now being evaluated and promise to provide a therapy that is effective in the majority of patients. The currently recommended therapy of chronic hepatitis B is a 4- to 6-month course of alpha-interferon in doses of 5-10 million units three times a week; a regimen that results in sustained clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) from serum in approximately one-third and a loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in one-tenth of patients. Long-term follow-up of patients who respond to interferon treatment with clearance of HBeAg indicate that the majority ultimately clear HBsAg as well and have continued remission in the liver disease, although low levels of HBV DNA can commonly be detected in liver tissue. Better therapies of hepatitis B are needed. Recently, several oral 'second-generation' nucleoside analogues have been developed that have potent activity against HBV. The best studied is lamivudine (3-thiacytidine) which results in marked inhibition of HBV DNA levels and improvement in serum aminotransferases and hepatic histology in the majority of patients. When stopped, however, most patients relapse and the shortcomings of long-term therapy have been the development of viral resistance in up to one-quarter of patients within a year and a higher percentage with more prolonged therapy. Future approaches of therapy of promise for hepatitis B are combinations of lamivudine with interferon and other antiviral nucleoside analogues. The currently recommended therapy of chronic hepatitis C is a 12- to 18-month course of alpha interferon in doses of 3 million units three times a week: a regimen that results in sustained clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in approximately 20% of patients. Sustained responses have been associated with marked improvements in hepatic histology and long-term studies indicate that the majority of patients remain free of virus in serum and liver, suggesting a 'cure' of infection. Responses to interferon correlate to some degree with clinical and virological features, including young age, absence of hepatic fibrosis, low levels of HCV RNA in serum and HCV genotypes 2 and 3.

4244,0.005,1.0000,"AIDS associated malignancies (ARL) is a major complication associated with AIDS patients upon immunosuppression. Chronically immunocompromised patients have a markedly increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disease. In the era of potent antiretrovirals therapy (ARV), the malignant complications due to HIV-1 infection have decreased in developed nations where ARV is administered, but still poses a major problem in developing countries where HIV-1 incidence is high and ARV is still not yet widely available. Even in ARV treated individuals there is a concern that the prolonged survival of many HIV-1 carriers is likely to eventually result in an increased number of malignancies diagnosed. Malignancies that were found to have high incidence in HIV-infected individuals are Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The incidence of NHL has increased nearly 200 fold in HIV-positive patients, and accounts for a greater percentage of AIDS defining illness in the US and Europe since the advent of HAART therapy. These AIDS related lymphomas are distinct from their counterparts seen in HIV-1 seronegative patients. For example nearly half of all cases of ARL are associated with the presence of a gamma herpesvirus, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) or human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8)/ Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV). The pathogenesis of ARLs is complex. B-cell proliferation driven by chronic antigenemia resulting in the induction of polyclonal and ultimately monoclonal lymphoproliferation may occur in the setting of severe immunosuppression."

Incident HSV-2 infection was defined serologically as ""recent"" if a negative result of testing for HSV-2 could be documented within the previous 6 months or ""remote"" if >6 months had elapsed since the last negative test result. The prevalence of HSV-2 at enrollment was 43%. The HSV-2 incidence was 11.4 cases/100 person-years, and the HIV-1 incidence was 5.8 cases/100 person-years. The adjusted hazard ratios of HIV-1 acquisition from exposure to HSV-2 infection were 1.67 for prevalent HSV-2, 1.92 for remote incident HSV-2, and 3.81 for recent incident HSV-2. Recent incident HSV-2 infection was associated with the highest risk of HIV-1 in this study, which suggests that prevention of HSV-2 infection may reduce the risk of HIV-1 acquisition."
1383,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection during pregnancy is a condition that requires multidisciplinary care. Care must be rendered that is appropriate for both the mother and the fetus. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is of paramount concern. To prevent transmission, universal testing for HIV infection in pregnant women is ideal. In the United States and other developed countries, great strides have been made toward decreasing the risk of HIV transmission to infants to <2% with use of a combination of highly active antiretroviral therapy during the antepartum period and during labor and delivery, scheduled cesarean section when appropriate, avoidance of breast-feeding, and 6 weeks of zidovudine prophylaxis for infants. The continuation of antiretroviral therapy after delivery depends on the needs of the mother with regard to treatment of her own health. In resource-limited countries, where simplified and shortened courses of antiretroviral regimens have been used, reduction in mother-to-child transmission has also been shown, although not as effectively as that with highly active antiretroviral therapy. In these settings, exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months is recommended to reduce the risk of postnatal transmission."
6954,0.005,1.0000,"We documented HIV-risk behavior and the public health context of AIDS in women living with a severe and persistent mental illness. Sixty-one women were recruited from outpatient clinics and day-treatment programs at a state psychiatric hospital. They completed a survey that included measures of HIV-related risk behavior, the perceived importance of 11 public health and social problems including AIDS, HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, perceived risk, and behavioral intentions. Thirty-eight percent of participants engaged in at least one type of HIV-risk behavior during the 2 months before assessment, 23% reported two or more risk factors, and 16% reported three or more risk factors. Consistent condom use was rare. Participants reporting 1 or more risk factors were more likely than those reporting no risk to report histories of alcohol or drug treatment, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV testing, and more perceived risk of HIV infection. Poverty and unemployment were viewed as more serious problems than HIV infection and AIDS. HIV-prevention interventions that are tailored to the needs and priorities of women with a severe mental illness are urgently needed to prevent further infections."
636,0.005,1.0000,"Despite advances in antiretroviral therapy and in the treatment and prevention of opportunistic infections, oncological and consequent hematologic complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection continue to occur and are of significant clinical importance. Virus-related tumors (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma, induced by human herpesvirus 8; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, linked to Epstein-Barr virus; and anogenital tumors, linked to human papillomavirus) are frequent in patients with HIV-induced immune deficiency. The incidence of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma has declined among homosexual men, but this tumor remains problematic in many patients. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is 60 times more prevalent in HIV-positive persons than in others and typically presents as advanced-stage, high- or intermediate-grade B cell lymphoma, with frequent extranodal involvement. Primary central nervous system lymphoma is also common. Cervical carcinoma in HIV-positive women is also usually advanced at diagnosis. Anal carcinoma is increasing in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative populations. Chemotherapy for these tumors can result in dose-limiting cytopenia that can be well-controlled with hematopoietic growth factors, allowing patients to avoid transfusions and maintain the dose intensity of their chemotherapy regimens."
4530,0.005,1.0000,"In the United States, 10 million inmates are released every year, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevalence is several-fold greater in criminal justice populations than in the community. Few effective linkage-to-the-community programs are currently available for prisoners infected with HIV. As a result, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is seldom continued after release, and virological and immunological outcomes worsen. Poor HIV treatment outcomes result from a myriad of obstacles that released prisoners face upon reentering the community, including homelessness, lack of medical insurance, relapse to drug and alcohol use, and mental illness. This article will focus on 5 distinct factors that contribute significantly to treatment outcomes for released prisoners infected with HIV and have profound individual and public health implications: (1) adaptation of case management services to facilitate linkage to care; (2) continuity of cART; (3) treatment of substance use disorders; (4) continuity of mental illness treatment; and (5) reducing HIV-associated risk-taking behaviors as part of secondary prevention."

3303,0.005,1.0000,"The relevance of zinc in resistance to infections by virus, fungi and bacteria is recognized because of its pivotal role in the efficiency of the entire immune system, in particular in conferring biological activity to a thymic hormone called thymulin, which has differentiation properties on T-cell lines. In infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the zinc-bound form of thymulin (active thymulin, ZnFTS) is strongly reduced in stage IV of the disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification) with concomitant decrements in CD4(+) cell count and zincemia values. The zinc-unbound form of thymulin (inactive thymulin, FTS) is, in contrast, very high. The in vitro addition of zinc to plasma samples induces a recovery of the thymulin active form, suggesting low zinc bioavailability as the cause of impaired thymic functions with consequent CD4(+) depletion. An analysis of risk factors for the incidence of recidivism opportunistic infections shows CD4(+) depletion and zinc deficiency to have significant scores. Supplementation with zinc for 1 mo (45 mg Zn(2+)/d) associated with zidovudine (AZT) therapy in stage IV induces recovery of active zinc-bound thymulin, of zincemia, of CD4(+) cells with concomitant reduction (50%) of recidivism opportunistic infections compared with the AZT-treated group. Complete disappearance of recidivism by Candida aesophagea or Pneumocystis carinii is observed after supplementation with zinc. The relative risk factors (CD4(+) depletion and zinc-deficiency) have lower scores in the HIV-positive zinc-treated group, confirming, as such, the relevance of zinc in opportunistic infections that involve extracellular matrix. Such an assumption is indirectly confirmed with new HAART, where no opportunistic infections occur. Indeed, HIV RNA is inversely correlated with both CD4(+) and zincemia values (r = -0.73, P<0.01) in HAART-treated subjects. Lower scores for the same relative factors for the appearance of opportunistic infections are present in HAART-treated subjects compared with those treated with AZT. These findings, on the one hand, show the poor efficacy of AZT therapy compared with HAART therapy for the progression of HIV, but on the other hand, they suggest that the lack of occurrence of opportunistic infections by HAART may also result from major zinc bioavailability. This further supports the key role played by zinc against opportunistic infections in HIV with a possible independent effect by either HIV or the pathogens involved."
705,0.005,1.0000,"This study investigated the number and range of surgical procedures performed in patients subsequently found to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. Procedures were included if they occurred during a period when the patients were likely to have been infected with HIV but unaware of their HIV status. A total of 28 operative procedures were documented in 19 (22 per cent) of 86 patients. Several operations were major and invasive. All patients had recognized risk factors for HIV infection but these had not been elicited in the surgical records. Women and patients who acquired their disease through heterosexual intercourse were more likely to have undergone surgery before a diagnosis of HIV than homosexual men. The incidence of surgical procedures in patients with HIV infection was significantly greater than in the general population of Leicestershire; however, many of these were minor and related to the management of complications associated with HIV. Surgeons are performing operations on patients who are unknowingly infected with HIV. The risk of transmission of HIV to surgeons is remote, but surgeons must be aware of risk factors for HIV infection."
8865,0.005,1.0000,"The deleterious effect of HIV on the immune system begins at the time of infection. At seroconversion the virologic and immunologic factors that ultimately will dictate the rate of disease progression are believed to be already in place. The concept developed in this paper implies that, to impact significantly on the progression of disease, anti-HIV therapies should be initiated as early as possible in asymptomatic individuals. Published results have shown that combination drug therapies are potent in reducing HIV-1 RNA load in plasma in asymptomatic individuals, and that some HIV-1 immune-based therapies have a positive impact on immunological markers of disease progression, including HIV-1 cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and CD4 percent. The strategy discussed is to test a combination of antiretroviral therapy with HIV-1 immune-based therapy, such as the inactivated HIV-1 immunogen preparation, in asymptomatic individuals. The goal of this combination approach is to overcome the limitations of each therapy alone. Preliminary data suggest that antiretroviral therapy and the HIV-1 Immunogen can be combined with no noticeable interference and/or added toxicity in a broad range of HIV-1-infected individuals. Combining both therapies may enhance and expand the impact on key surrogate markers of disease progression, although they likely achieve this impact through different mechanisms. Thus, the primary question remains: Can these effects be synergistic?"

The study, from April 2003 to May 2005, with follow-up through 24 mo, was conducted at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Second Xiangya Hospital, Central-South University in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. Twenty-seven HIV1-infected patients received didanosine, stavudine, and nevirapine. Information from case notes regarding age, sex, side effects, viral load, naive and memory T cells, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell count at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo was collected and analyzed. Virologic suppression, defined as an HIV RNA concentration of less than 50 copies/mL at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24, was considered the main outcome measure. Of 27 patients, 17 were men with a mean age 33.5 yr. The mean baseline viral load was 5.15 log copies/mL and the mean CD4(+) cell count was 185 cells/dL. Of 27 patients, 3 patients discontinued study medication; treatment was changed, because of side effects, from didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and nevirapine (NVP) to zidovudine, lamivudine, and NVP for 24 patients who had completed 24 mo of treatment with ddI, d4T, and NVP; and viral load suppression was attained in 17 patients (70.8%) at 12 mo, in 14 patients (58.3%) at 18 mo, and in 13 patients (56.6%) at 24 mo. The CD4 T cell count increased by 114 cells/microL (mean, 299 cells/microL) after 12 mo of treatment and by 132 cells/microL (mean, 317 cells/microL) after 24 mo of treatment. Naive T cells and memory cells also increased in number, but at a slower rate. Activated (CD38(+)) CD8(+) T cells were elevated at baseline (67.7%) and declined by month 24 (49.7%), but did not reach normal levels. We conclude that a regimen of NVP with ddI and d4T provided durable suppression of plasma viral load in HIV-infected patients, with significant improvement in the CD4 cell count, and can be well tolerated by patients with HIV-1 infection."
640,0.005,1.0000,"The main failure of antiretroviral therapy is the lack of restoration of HIV-specific CD4(+) T cells. IL-7, which has been shown to be a crucial cytokine for thymopoiesis, has been envisaged as an additive therapeutic strategy. However, in vitro studies suggest that IL-7 might sustain HIV replication in thymocytes and T lymphocytes. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the effect of IL-7 on both T cell renewal and viral load in SIVmac-infected young macaques in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. This evaluation was conducted during the asymptomatic phase in view of a potential treatment of HIV patients. We show that IL-7 induces both a central renewal and a peripheral expansion of T lymphocytes associated with cell activation. No alarming modulation of the other hemopoietic cells was observed. No increase in the viral load was shown in blood or lymph nodes. These data strengthen the rationale for the use of IL-7 as an efficient immunotherapy in AIDS."
3629,0.005,1.0000,"Several studies have shown the importance of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in achieving HIV-1 suppression. However, most have focused on naïve patients and do not assess the impact of HAART on viral load (VL). Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of an adherence program in a cohort of multitreated and poorly adherent patients. We performed a cohort study of all adult HIV-1 infected patients with detectable VL who were treatment experienced and poorly adherent to HAART, included in an adherence program since its introduction in 2009 (n=136). The adherence program consisted of a multidisciplinary team with a nurse who specialized in behavioral intervention, counselling on substance abuse, and motivational interviewing, as well as a social worker responsible for referring patients to local healthcare centers. Effectiveness was evaluated as percentage of patients with VL <50 copies/mL at week 48 by modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis. Initially, 76.6% of the patients had an adherence <30% according to the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ). At 48 weeks, 48.1% of the patients had VL <50 copies/mL, and the adherence was >90% in 71% of the patients. In multivariate analysis, a ratio of bottle refill per month >0.9 during the study [odds ratio (OR) 14.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.08-50.08, p<0.001] and being on a b.i.d. regimen (OR 12.5; 95% CI 1.81-86.4, p=0.010) were associated with an undetectable VL. In conclusion, the adherence program was successful in almost half of the patients, despite their long treatment experience and prior poor adherence. This strategy may help to prevent disease progression and the risk of HIV transmission in these patients."
4241,0.005,1.0000,"Because of shared routes of transmission, coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV), or both, is common among HIV-infected persons, affecting approximately 15 to 30% and 10 to 15% of patients, respectively. Advances in antiretroviral therapy have improved the life expectancy of patients infected with HIV, and, as a consequence, HCV-related liver disease has emerged as a significant comorbid disease among such patients. Concurrent HIV infection may be associated with higher serum HCV RNA levels, accelerated progression of hepatic fibrosis, increased risk of end-stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma and death among persons coinfected with hepatitis C. Similarly, coinfection with HCV and HBV may lead to more severe liver disease and greater risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than does HCV infection alone. Although definitive randomized controlled trials are not yet completed, current guidelines recommend the use of pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin for the treatment of chronic HCV in eligible HIV-infected persons. Conversely, the optimal treatment of chronic HCV in persons with chronic HBV infection has not been defined but may include pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin, with or without additional antiviral agents, such as lamivudine or adefovir, or both."
836,0.005,1.0000,"Patients coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are less responsive to anti-HCV therapies and are at a higher risk of toxicity than HCV monoinfected patients. HCV viral kinetics is the basis for the study of response to interferon-based therapy and for predicting sustained virological response (SVR). A lack of early virological response (EVR; undetectable HCV RNA or a decrease of >/=2 log(10) from baseline) after 12 weeks of pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) is an equally reliable predictor of lack of SVR in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients and in the monoinfected HCV population. Early stopping rules are particularly important in coinfected HIV/HCV patients, considering their low chances of response in the more difficult-to-treat HCV genotypes 1 and 4 (<30%). Several factors have been involved in this low efficacy, including higher baseline HCV viraemia, slower viral kinetics decay under interferon pressure and a defective immune substratum. A better understanding of HCV viral kinetics under HCV therapy may be the basis for assaying different peg-IFN plus RBV schedules, such as induction or extending strategies, and may help physicians to make tailored decisions for the management of their patients."
9772,0.005,1.0000,"The present study aims at evaluating the association between seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in five genes involved on antiretroviral pharmacokinetic pathways and virological failure in first line highly active antiretroviral therapy. Seven candidate polymorphisms (rs3842 and rs1045642 in ABCB1, rs212091 and rs3743527 in ABCC1, rs3745274 in CYP2B6, rs628031 in SLC22A1 and rs1517618 in SLCO3A1) were evaluated if they were associated with virological failure through logistic regression analysis. The study design was a retrospective cohort, analyzing 187 patients from Recife metropolitan region (Pernambuco, Brazil): among these 160 obtained complete suppression of HIV-1 replication (responders) and were compared to 27 non-responders, which underwent virological failure. There was no association between CYP2B6, SLC22A1, and SLCO3A1 SNPs and virological failure. Using logistic regression analysis, a significant association was detected between rs1045642 (3435C>T, ABCB1) and rs212091 (198217T>C; 3'-UTR, ABCC1) with virological failure of first-line antiretroviral regimens containing protease inhibitors, when controlled by clinical factors, such as sex, age and race. The present results could contribute to unravel the influence of genetic background in anti-HIV-1 therapy outcome and help in treatment personalization of Northeast Brazil HIV infected patients. "
5876,0.005,1.0000,"Many physicians, dentists, and allied health personnel sustain occupational exposures to blood and other body fluids that increase their risk of contracting type B viral hepatitis. Overall, the risk of hepatitis B among persons employed in health-related fields is estimated to be approximately four times that in the general adult population. Studies on the incidence of infection and the prevalence of hepatitis B serologic markers have further defined risk in specific occupational categories and work activities. Physicians and dentists are five to ten times more likely than the general adult population to experience hepatitis B infection. Infection rates ten or more times above the average have often been characteristic of surgeons, patient care personnel in dialysis units and institutions for the mentally handicapped, and clinical laboratory workers having frequent contact with blood samples."
5273,0.005,1.0000,"An 18 year-old heterosexual man was hospitalized because of fever, chills, a sore throat, and a dry cough for 8 days. He had had sexual intercourse with a new partner within the 4 months prior to admission. At admission, the patient presented a clinical picture compatible with hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). The presence of hemophagocytosis was subsequently determined pathologically from bone marrow and lymph node specimens. An exhaustive diagnostic work-up failed to reveal any causative etiology, the symptoms improving after 2 doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, given at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg each, the 2 doses being administered 1 week apart. Three months subsequent to the patient's initial presentation, acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was diagnosed, and the patient received highly active antiretrovirus therapy (HAART) from the time of diagnosis. The patient remained well for the following 2 years. HPS in the advanced stages of HIV infection has previously been described, but HPS during seroconversion of an acute form of the infection is rare. We most definitely suggest, however, that acute HIV infection be included in the list of potential causes of HPS. IVIG therapy appears to be an appropriate therapeutic modality, and HAART also is effective, for prevention of recurrence of HPS in a patient with acute HIV infection."
2524,0.005,1.0000,"Aberrant activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) with excessive production of interferon alpha (IFNα) represents one of the hallmarks of immune activation during chronic phase of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A number of studies have shown that disruption of mucosal integrity in the gut is a cause of persistent immune activation. However, little is known about the role that pDCs play in this process, and our current understanding comes from the simian immunodeficiency virus macaque model. Thus, in the present study we sought to investigate the frequency and function of pDCs in peripheral blood and gut samples from HIV-infected individuals before and 6 months after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We show that circulating pDCs were depleted in ART-naive HIV+ patients, and upregulated the gut-homing receptor CD103 compared with uninfected controls. By converse, pDCs accumulated in the terminal ileum of ART-naive HIV individuals compared with controls. Baseline levels of IFNα production and markers of immune activation in gut samples of ART-naive HIV subjects were elevated. All these parameters declined after 6 months of ART. Our results suggest that in chronic HIV infection, pDCs migrate from peripheral blood to the gut-associated lymphatic tissue, where they may contribute to immune activation. "
8058,0.005,1.0000,"T cell apoptosis represents a common mechanism of T cell depletion in HIV-1-infected individuals reflecting maturational and functional T cell abnormalities either directly or indirectly induced by the virus. In the present study, the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the spontaneous apoptosis of distinct T cell subsets were investigated during a 6-month follow-up in a cohort of HIV-1-infected individuals with CD4(+) cell counts between 100 and 500 cells/microliter and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels >/=10, 000 copies/ml. We determined that the rapid and sustained increase of both naive (CD45RA(+)CD62L(+)) and memory (CD45R0(+) and CD45RA(+)/CD62L(-)) CD4(+) and, to as lesser extent, CD8(+) T cells in peripheral blood was associated with a significant decrease of apoptotic CD4(+) and CD8(+) as well as CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells. Among CD4(+) lymphocytes, at enrollment, the highest frequency of apoptotic cells was observed within the memory compartment, as defined by CD45R0 expression. During HAART, however, the frequency of CD4(+)CD45R0(+) apoptotic T cells progressively decreased in association with a significant downregulation of surface activation markers that indicated decreased levels of systemic immune stimulation. These results indicate that effective viral suppression can contribute to progressive normalization of maturational and functional T cell abnormalities responsible for the high levels of T cell apoptosis in HIV-1-infected individuals. This, in turn, may contribute to a reduced rate of T cell loss and immune reconstitution during HAART."
4757,0.005,1.0000,"The impact of drug resistance mutations induced by nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NRTI) on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) recognition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain LAI (HIV-1(LAI)) RT was addressed in 35 treated or untreated patients. Two HIV-1(LAI) RT regions encompassing mutation M41L, L74V, M184V, and T215Y/F were recognized in 75 and 83% mutated and in 33 and 42% unmutated samples, respectively. A total of 41 new CTL epitopes overlapping these mutations were predicted. Mutations enhanced HLA-binding scores of 17 epitopes, decreased scores of 5, and had no effect in 19. Four predicted epitopes containing mutations 41, 74, and 184 were tested and recognized by CD8 cells from mutated or unmutated samples, with frequencies up to 270 gamma interferon spot-forming cells per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Therefore, RT mutations induced by NRTI can increase the immunogenicity of RT for CTL and might allow a better immune control of resistant viruses in vivo, suggesting that specific immune therapy might help prevent these mutations."
6023,0.005,1.0000,"The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has considerably improved the quality of life and has increased the survival of HIV-infected individuals. Although HAART can successfully suppress viral replication in the long term, it is not without significant toxicity, which can seriously compromise treatment effectiveness. Moreover, the rapid rate of virus mutation and subsequent emergence of drug-resistant HIV variants threaten the longer-term efficacy of HIV treatment. The most common adverse effects caused by HAART include a metabolic syndrome with lipodystrophy, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance, deterioration in the clinical status due to various exaggerated local and systemic inflammatory reactions during the immunerestoration disease, and various hepatic, peripheral and cardiac muscle, kidney, bone, bone marrow, retinal, ear, and skin toxicities. The heterogeneity in the organs affected by the different drugs and the morphological features observed in tissues in HAART-treated patients raise possible explanations including differential distribution or activation of these agents. Antiretroviral drugs from new classes, as well as new drugs from existing classes with favorable resistance and side effect profiles are in various stages of development. However, new tissue disorders will be certainly described in the future in patients treated with these drugs. The different pathophysiology of the main adverse effects and the less common known side effects of antiretroviral therapy against HIV are described here, with special emphasis on the histological features induced by HAART."
5499,0.005,1.0000,"(1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was employed to noninvasively monitor neuronal injury in eight rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), whose immune system was compromised by CD8 T lymphocyte depletion and treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). SIV infection and CD8 depletion resulted in a rapid decline in cerebral N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels, a sensitive marker of neuronal health. Within 3 months of SIV infection and CD8 depletion, four animals developed AIDS and severe SIV encephalitis. The other four macaques underwent daily doses of HAART beginning 4 weeks after infection/CD8 depletion. HAART involved drugs that do not penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) including 9-[2(R)-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine and a racemic mixture of D: -L: -enantiomers of 2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'thiacytidine. HAART resulted in reversal of NAA/Cr decline after 4 weeks of therapy, and no virus or encephalitis was found in brain samples analyzed. These results indicate that the CNS injury in AIDS is entirely dependent on events involving the peripheral immune system mediated by trafficking of SIV-infected monocytes into the brain. The rapid decline in NAA/Cr with SIV infection/CD8 depletion and its rapid recovery with HAART suggest that: (1) infected monocyte turnover in the CNS is rapid, occurring in days to weeks; (2) there are endogenous mechanisms that reverse neuronal injury; and (3) a threshold level of infected monocytes/macrophages in the CNS is required to overcome the neuronal recovery processes. These observations explain the clinical success of antiretroviral therapy in reducing the incidence of HIV-associated dementia and minor cognitive/motor disorder and suggest novel targets for drug development."
7815,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has many genotypes which are closely associated with the severity of chronic hepatitis and the response to antiviral therapy. Although HCV is essentially hepatotropic, several lines of evidence suggest that this virus can infect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in most patients with chronic HCV infection. However, the methods used previously to detect negative-strand HCV RNA have been questioned, and the PBMC tropism of different HCV genotypes remains unknown. A stringent method was used to investigate the prevalence of positive- and negative-strand HCV RNA in the PBMC of 106 patients with chronic hepatitis C and to analyze the influence of HCV genotype on the tropism of PBMC. HCV type 1b was the predominant strain in the patients. Positive-strand RNA in PBMC was detected in 83 (78%) and 40% had negative-strand RNA. The demographic and clinical features were comparable among different patients grouped by the replication status of HCV in the plasma and PBMC samples. In addition, there was no significant difference of PBMC tropism between type 1b and non-1b HCV. In summary, HCV does indeed infect actively the PBMC of chronic hepatitis C patients and such infection is not correlated to the pathogenesis of liver cell damage. Moreover, the genotype is not associated specifically with PBMC tropism of HCV."
6511,0.005,1.0000,"This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) among homeless persons with co-occurring severe mental illness (SMI) and substance use disorders and to determine associated risk factors. As part of a longitudinal study of the effectiveness of integrated treatment for homeless persons with SMI and substance abuse or dependence, serological testing was performed to ascertain the prevalence of HIV, HBV, and HCV. At baseline, 6.2% of participants (11/172) were HIV-positive. Nearly one third of participants (37/114) had evidence of prior exposure to HBV, and 30% (34/114) were antibody positive for HCV. About 44% of participants (50/114) had a reactive test for either HBV or HCV. Having a reactive test was strongly associated with substance use, especially with a history of injection drug use. A significant threat exists to the health and well-being of homeless person with SMI due to high prevalence of blood-borne pathogens. Mental health providers need to play a proactive role in the identification of health-related needs and to assist with access to general health services for persons with SMI."
53,0.005,1.0000,"Recent analysis of antiretroviral treatment (ART) program data in Georgia showed that end-stage liver disease was a leading cause of death among HIV/HCV co infected patients in 2005. The objective of this retrospective study was to study prevailing genotypes and subtypes of HCV virus in a cohort of HIV infected patients. The investigation revealed that of 1490 patients, 879 (59%) were hepatitis C antibody positive. Detectable HCV RNA was found among 91% of patients. Median liver HCV RNA level was higher than among mono-infected patients. The most prevalent genotypes were genotype 1 (41.6%), followed by genotype 3 (34.7%) and genotype 2 (17.6%), inter (mix) genotype recombinants were found among 5.8 % of patients. The genotype distribution in our study is slightly different from what was seen in Georgia in 2000. The differences of prevailing HCV genotypes among general population and HIV co infected group was probably attributed to the different methods for sample selection used within our study or possible influence of diverse transmission networks among HIV infected group. Another explanation can be the possible shift from predominance of genotype 1 to non 1 genotypes. The higher number intergenotype recombinant forms might be the result of continues parenteral exposure to different HCV genotypes during drug injection paraphernalia. Our study demonstrated high prevalence of HCV infection among HIV-infected patients and revealed 1b as predominant genotype. IDUs were less likely to spontaneously clear the virus than homosexual man and heterosexually infected woman. A greater HCV RNA levels were associated with a greater chance to be infected with HCV genotypes 1. Possible shift from predominance of genotype 1 to non 1 genotypes can be of option. This shift may have a major and beneficial impact on treatment schedules and costs. The higher number intergenotype recombinant forms might be the results of continues parenteral exposure to different HCV genotypes during drug injection paraphernalia. Study results highlights and strengthens the need for careful follow-up of HCV/HIV co infected patients, effective management and therapies against HCV in order to reduce liver related death rates in patients on ART."
9638,0.005,1.0000,"Quantitative assays for viral nucleic acids have been instrumental in monitoring the response of patients to various antiviral therapies. The level of viraemia is predictive of clinical outcome in that a reduced risk of progression to AIDS or death was observed with lower plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA levels. Rebound in viral levels often signals therapeutic failures, some of which are associated with the development of drug resistance. Quantitative plasma assays for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been developed. Over time, modifications to these assays have been required to meet new demands. For example, as antiviral therapies have become more effective, HIV and HCV assays of greater sensitivity are required in order to follow patients for longer periods of time and to fully assess the extent of viral suppression. For HIV-1, a large percentage of patients treated with combination therapies had viral loads that were below the detection limit of the ultrasensitive assay (50 copies/ml). To assess the residual viral burden in this patient population an assay to quantify HIV-1 proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was developed. Studies to date indicate that proviral DNA remains easily detectable despite undetectable plasma RNA and may be useful in monitoring this patient population. To increase assay throughput, a new generation of quantitative assays that will provide real-time detection and a 6 log10 detection range from a single amplification is under development."
8726,0.005,1.0000,"We report the first study on prevalence of antiretroviral drug-associated resistance mutations in Venezuela. Protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding regions were analyzed in DNA samples obtained from 100 HIV-1-infected individuals. Primary resistance mutations to RT inhibitors were identified in 26% of patients treated with these drugs. Transmission of HIV-1-resistant strains was detected in a drug-naive patient (3%). Primary resistance mutations to protease inhibitors (PIs) were present in 9% of the 44 PI-treated patients and in 1 PI-naive individual. Phylogenetic analysis of these samples has resulted in the most extensive survey, to date, of HIV-1 genetic forms circulating in Venezuela. Ninety-nine samples clustered with subtype B, and 1 individual harbored the first B/F recombinant virus reported in Venezuela, with protease clustering with subtype F and RT with subtype B. In addition, this isolate had a new insertion (Glu-34 duplication) in the protease gene."
68,0.005,1.0000,"The authors have successfully used combination ganciclovir and foscarnet chemotherapy to control viral replication following liver transplantation in a patient with severe recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The disease was characterized by extremely high viraemias, deteriorating liver function, and high levels of intra-hepatic hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Treatment resulted in a greater than 30-fold reduction in serum HBV DNA and HBsAg levels. Liver function tests returned to normal and the histological progression of the disease was arrested. Hepatic cytoplasmic HBsAg decreased substantially but there was little change in HBcAg, implicating HBsAg rather than HBcAg in the liver injury. Combination antiviral chemotherapy using agents such as ganciclovir and foscarnet may offer a new approach to the management of post-transplant recurrence of HBV."
9199,0.005,1.0000,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is widely used to treat hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients in the USA and Europe. No confirmed report of resistance selection during treatment with TDF in treatment-naïve and nucleoside/nucleotide analog-treated chronic hepatitis B patients has yet been reported. Here, we report for the first time a patient with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis who emerged with virologic breakthrough during combination therapy with TDF and entecavir (ETV), against ETV-resistant virus. A 51-year-old Japanese woman with hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg), whose genotype was C, received ETV monotherapy continuously followed by TDF and ETV combination therapy, because her HBV DNA levels had been >3.5 log copies/mL. At the start of combination therapy, amino acid substitutions of the reverse transcriptase (rt) gene, rtL180M, rtT184I/M, and rtM204V, were detected. After this, serum HBV DNA decreased to less than 2.1 log copies/mL and remained at this level until 31 months of combination therapy, when it again began to increase. Amino acid substitutions of rtL180M, rtS202G, and rtM204V emerged and were associated with an increase in serum HBV DNA at virologic breakthrough. Long-term therapy with TDF against the ETV-resistant virus has the potential to induce virologic breakthrough and resistance, and careful follow-up should be carried out. "
5141,0.005,1.0000,"Monitoring hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants periodically during nucleoside analogue treatment is of great clinical significance, particularly in persistently HBV DNA-positive patients. However, few studies have investigated the dynamic changes of HBV YMDD (Tyr-Met-Asp-Asp) and YVDD (Tyr-Val-Asp-Asp) populations in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients whilst undergoing lamivudine (LMV) treatment. In this study, we sought to investigate the dynamic changes of HBV YMDD and YVDD variants by ultrasensitive real-time amplification refractory mutation system quantitative PCR (RT-ARMS-qPCR) and evaluate its significance for changes in the treatment of CHB patients. RT-ARMS-qPCR was established and evaluated with standard recombinant plasmids. Fifteen CHB patients receiving LMV (100 mg daily) were consecutively recruited and followed up for 60 weeks. Serum samples were obtained from each patient at baseline and every 12 weeks. The total HBV DNA, HBV YMDD DNA and YVDD DNA levels were measured using RT-ARMS-qPCR at all given time points after treatment. Routine liver biochemistry parameters, including aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, were also measured every 12 weeks. The linear range of the assay was between 1×10(12) and 1×10(5) copies ml(-1). The low detection limit was 1×10(4) copies ml(-1). After 60 weeks of LMV treatment, nine patients experienced virological breakthrough. The YVDD variant could be detected 12-48 weeks before virological breakthrough. The YVDD variant was detected as the predominant population (range 69.4-100 %) in patients by the time virological breakthrough appeared. We concluded that RT-ARMS-qPCR was sensitive for the detection and quantification of low levels of HBV mutation. Periodic detection of HBV YM(V)DD every 12 weeks during LMV treatment is helpful for therapeutic decision making. "

Herein we have reported two cases of HBV recurrence following relapse of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Both cases had LDLT for end-stage liver disease secondary to HBV infection with nodules of HCC exceeding the Milan criteria. HBV prophylaxis using hepatitis B immunoglobulin with nucleos (t) ide analogues were given and HBV DNA levels were consistently undetectable after LDLT. HCC recurred at 5 months and 13 months posttransplant respectively, and chemotherapy and radiation therapy were performed. HBV recurrence occurred during the treatment of HCC. HBV DNA levels increased despite the treatment with anti-HBV agents after HBV recurrence. In hepatitis B surface antigen positive recipients, HBV prophylaxis should be intensified during the treatment of recurrent HCC."
6446,0.005,1.0000,"Multiple mutations were found in the human immunodeficiency virus pol gene following treatment of an AIDS patient with antiretroviral drugs. After approximately 2.5 years of monthly alternating therapy with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), most of the pol sequences amplified from the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA contained known AZT resistance mutations at codons 41, 67, and 215 and a putative ddC resistance mutation at codon 69 as well as other novel mutations. These mutations persisted for 6 months after the patient was switched to 2',3'-dideoxyinosine monotherapy. Mutations known to be associated with 2',3'-dideoxyinosine resistance did not occur during this time. Antiviral susceptibility testing of point mutants, introduced into the genetic background of laboratory strain NL4-3, showed that the codon 41 mutation antagonized ddC resistance when present with the codon 69 mutation. However, this antagonism was not found with a chimeric mutant containing the patient's pol gene sequence from codons 25 to 218, implying that other mutations compensated for the antagonism. Thus, alternating therapy with AZT and ddC resulted in the selection of viruses resistant to both drugs."
4979,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a common coinfection in HIV-infected patients, and significant liver disease and mortality occur as the result of this disease combination. Potent anti-HBV therapy is available and can be used to improve outcomes by suppressing HBV DNA. Many HBV agents have dual activity with HIV and may be used to treat both diseases. However, care must be taken when using HBV nucleos(t)ides that have not been fully studied in the HIV-infected population because the emergence of strains resistant to HIV treatment has been reported. Careful monitoring of response to treatment is needed when treating an HIV/HBV patient with severe immune suppression. Improved ability to obtain long-term HBV DNA suppression and avoid resistance will translate into improved survival in this population."
6442,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope V3 region sequences of peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA were analyzed from three nontransmitting mothers (infected mothers who failed to transmit HIV-1 to their infants in the absence of antiretroviral therapy), including one mother with two deliveries, and compared with the sequences of seven previously analyzed transmitting mothers. The coding potential of the envelope open reading frame, including several patient-specific amino acid motifs and previously described molecular features across the V3 region, were highly conserved. There was a low degree of heterogeneity within the sequences of each nontransmitting mother compared with the sequences of transmitting mothers. In addition, the estimates of genetic diversity of nontransmitting mother sequences were significantly lower compared with transmitting mother sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences of each nontransmitting mother formed distinct clusters that were well discriminated from each other and the sequences of seven transmitting mothers. In conclusion, a low degree of HIV-1 genetic heterogeneity in these infected mothers correlates with lack of vertical transmission; this finding may be useful in developing strategies for further prevention of maternal-fetal transmission."
7180,0.005,1.0000,"Identifying microbial pathogens with zoonotic potential in wild-living primates can be important to human health, as evidenced by human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and Ebola virus. Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are ancient retroviruses that infect Old and New World monkeys and apes. Although not known to cause disease, these viruses are of public health interest because they have the potential to infect humans and thus provide a more general indication of zoonotic exposure risks. Surprisingly, no information exists concerning the prevalence, geographic distribution, and genetic diversity of SFVs in wild-living monkeys and apes. Here, we report the first comprehensive survey of SFVcpz infection in free-ranging chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) using newly developed, fecal-based assays. Chimpanzee fecal samples (n = 724) were collected at 25 field sites throughout equatorial Africa and tested for SFVcpz-specific antibodies (n = 706) or viral nucleic acids (n = 392). SFVcpz infection was documented at all field sites, with prevalence rates ranging from 44% to 100%. In two habituated communities, adult chimpanzees had significantly higher SFVcpz infection rates than infants and juveniles, indicating predominantly horizontal rather than vertical transmission routes. Some chimpanzees were co-infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz); however, there was no evidence that SFVcpz and SIVcpz were epidemiologically linked. SFVcpz nucleic acids were recovered from 177 fecal samples, all of which contained SFVcpz RNA and not DNA. Phylogenetic analysis of partial gag (616 bp), pol-RT (717 bp), and pol-IN (425 bp) sequences identified a diverse group of viruses, which could be subdivided into four distinct SFVcpz lineages according to their chimpanzee subspecies of origin. Within these lineages, there was evidence of frequent superinfection and viral recombination. One chimpanzee was infected by a foamy virus from a Cercopithecus monkey species, indicating cross-species transmission of SFVs in the wild. These data indicate that SFVcpz (i) is widely distributed among all chimpanzee subspecies; (ii) is shed in fecal samples as viral RNA; (iii) is transmitted predominantly by horizontal routes; (iv) is prone to superinfection and recombination; (v) has co-evolved with its natural host; and (vi) represents a sensitive marker of population structure that may be useful for chimpanzee taxonomy and conservation strategies."

The usefulness of beta 2-microglobulin as a prognostic marker during human immunodeficiency virus infection has been demonstrated in homosexual men and hemophiliacs; few and contradictory data have been reported in intravenous drug users. We have evaluated a cohort of 160 intravenous drug users (81 seronegative and 79 seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus infection) with normal renal function to assess whether serum beta 2-microglobulin could be used as a serological marker for monitoring infection; 78 healthy subjects were used as controls. Of 79 seropositive drug users, 54 were asymptomatic or had persistent generalized lymphoadenopathy the remaining 25 had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Seropositive patients were tested for CD4+ lymphocyte number, p24 antigen and anti-p24 antibodies. A significant statistical difference was found in mean serum beta 2-microglobulin levels between seronegative and seropositive drug users. Moreover, higher levels of beta 2-microglobulin were observed in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients compared with asymptomatic or patients with persistent lymphadenopathy. A significant relationship was also observed between increased concentration of beta 2-microglobulin and the serological and immunological markers which indicate human immunodeficiency virus disease progression."
7081,0.005,1.0000,"The route of transmission in more than 50% of the patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is unknown. Only a minority of patients have had a previous blood transfusion; sporadic spread seems to be much more important, although the role of inapparent parenteral exposure is yet to be established. Aim of this study was to investigate if a relationship exists between history for exposure to known risk factors, concurrent HBV status and histological findings (presence of cirrhosis) in patients with chronic HCV liver disease. We studied 86 subjects with chronic HCV liver disease, subdivided according to their HBV status. Fifty four patients were anti-HBV negative; in the remaining 32 subjects, antibodies to HBV were found. Our data show that: 1) history for exposure to known risk factors is more likely to be present in patients with chronic HCV liver disease and concurrent positivity for antibodies to HBV than in anti-HCV positive patients without HBV antibodies (62.5% vs 38.9%); and 2) the incidence of liver cirrhosis is higher in anti-HCV positive patients with anti-HBV antibodies than in exclusively anti-HCV positive patients (56.2% vs 12.9%). We conclude that the association of history for exposure to known risk factors and anti-HBV positivity could be a marker of progression from mild to severe liver damage in patients with chronic HCV liver disease (i.e. in the absence of both identifiable risk factors and HBV antibodies, HCV infection could have a less severe clinical outcome). Therefore, in these patients a closer follow-up and earlier interferon therapy are probably needed."

A total of 329 (22.0%) had antibodies to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc), a rate nearly four times as high as the 5.8% found recently in a national sample of young male adults, ages 18-26 years. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of anti-HBc positivity was independently associated with male sex, increasing age, lower level of education, three or more sexual partners in the previous year, and positive syphilis serology. Lack of condom use, history of nonulcerative sexually transmitted diseases, and genital herpes were not associated with anti-HBc positivity. These findings confirm that heterosexual exposure plays an important role in the spread of HBV infection. Furthermore, these data indicate that individuals with more than two sexual partners a year and those with positive syphilis serology should be immunised against HBV."
2749,0.005,1.0000,"Pneumonia is one of the most frequent complications in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-patients with Pneumocystis carinii as the leading cause. The true prevalence of atypical agents such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, C. trachomatis, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in this population of patients is unknown as the currently used method for diagnosing these agents is measurement of antibody levels. However, this method is of limited value in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients who may have a compromised antibody response. To evaluate the prevalence of Chlamydia spp., Legionella spp. and M. pneumoniae in HIV-infected patients with pulmonary disease, this retrospective study has applied inhibitor-controlled polymerase chain reaction analyses on 103 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids representing 103 episodes of pneumonia in 83 HIV-positive patients. L. pneumophila was detected in 1% of the BAL fluids and M. pneumoniae was found as a coexisting pathogen in 2% of the samples. Chlamydia spp. could not be detected in any of the BAL fluids. By culture and staining methods 106 other microorganisms were detected with P. carinii and Streptococcus pneumoniae as the most frequently occurring. Pneumonia due to Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila or Mycoplasma pneumoniae seems to be rare in Danish human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, but might be considered as a possible cause in cases of treatment failure."
8376,0.005,1.0000,"Signal joint T cell receptor excision circles (sjTRECs) have been reported as a clinical marker to measure the potential for recovery of the immune system after immunosuppressive treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate the thymic regenerative potential in 55 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infected (HIV(+)) and non-infected (HIV(-)) lymphoma patients, candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Moreover, the possible associations between sjTRECs and other immunological and clinical parameters were examined. SjTRECs levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and T lymphocyte subsets were analysed by flow cytometry. Our data showed that sjTRECs were reduced in lymphoma patients compared to healthy controls, although a weak significant association between low sjTRECs levels and increasing age was maintained [odds ratio (OR) = 4.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-17.17]. We found that different chemotherapeutic treatments seem to induce similar effects on the thymic reservoir, independently from their intensity (type and number of cycles of previous chemotherapy). Results from multivariate models including adjustment for patients' sex, type of lymphoma and type of chemotherapy showed that thymic output was independent from HIV infection (OR, 0.95; 95% CI 0.20-4.48). SjTRECs levels correlated with naive T cell subsets in overall lymphoma patients and after stratification by HIV infection (r > 0.37). HIV replication should be maximally suppressed to properly evaluate thymic output by sjTREC markers. Our results suggested that de novo T cell generation is maintained partially in pretreated recurrent lymphoma patients, candidates for ASCT, and could contribute to restore the immune function after transplantation."
5941,0.005,1.0000,"Adoptive immune transfer plays an important role in clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. However, it is unclear whether cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells could suppress HBV replication in CHB patients, especially if drug resistance develops. In this study, functional CIK cells were efficiently generated from 21 CHB patients and were transfused in an autologous manner. We found that CIK cells from the CHB patients displayed substantial proliferation and function. Administration of the CIK cells closely correlated with the decrease in the serum HBV load and improvement in liver function in some patients. The virological response rate in patients with baseline serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of >40 U/L was higher than that in patients with baseline serum ALT levels of < or = 40 U/L. Moreover, patients who had HBeAg loss or showed seroconversion generally had baseline serum ALT levels of >40 U/L. No serious side effects were observed. This protocol represents an alternative immune therapeutic strategy for the disease."
9997,0.005,1.0000,"Recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the graft is the major problem for patients with chronic HBV infection undergoing liver transplantation, which could be potentiated by the immunosuppression. In the present study, we used lymphocytes and hepatocytes isolated from patients with chronic HBV infection to investigate in vitro the effects of FK506 with and without methylprednisolone (25 ng/mL) on mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell activation marker expression, and HBV replication in human hepatocytes. Increasing concentrations of FK506 (0.1, 0.5, and 5 ng/mL) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation with a reduction of the stimulation index by 9.2%, 39.0%, and 55.1%, respectively, with no difference between 25 chronic HBV carriers and normal controls. Methylprednisolone alone had no effect but potentiated the inhibitory effect of all three FK506 concentrations, such that the stimulation index was decreased by 20%, 56.2%, and 65.7%, respectively. FK506 (0.5 ng/ mL) reduced both the percentage of interleukin-2 receptor expressing T cells and the cell surface density of this receptor by 7.1% and 8.7% (P < .01), whereas it only reduced the proportion of HLA-DR expressing T cells by 6.8%. FK506 did not change significantly the intracellular HBV DNA or the hepatic expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in short-term culture of human hepatocytes, whereas methylprednisolone increased the percentage of HBsAg-positive hepatocytes in all 5 patients with active viral replication. These results indicate that the effects of FK506 on T-cell activation in chronic HBV carriers are identical to normal subjects, resulting in marked suppression of T-lymphocyte function but only modest reduction in the expression of cell surface activation markers. The drug showed no direct stimulatory effect on viral replication, suggesting that FK506 can be a useful, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent for liver graft recipients with chronic HBV infection."
8292,0.005,1.0000,"This review has the objective to discuss the epidemiological aspects of the enterically transmitted hepatitis A and E in Brazil. The prevalence of hepatitis A varies greatly in different Brazilian regions, from 56% in South and Southeast to 93% in North region (Manaus, Amazon). Such differences are also found in different socioeconomic levels among age groups. A significantly higher prevalence was seen in the low socioeconomic group between 1-30 years. This difference is most striking in the first 10 years of age (23.5% vs 60.0%, high/middle vs low, respectively). Despite the improvements in sanitary conditions, hepatitis A is still endemic and outbreaks may occur. As an increasing proportion of the population is becoming susceptible to hepatitis A virus infection and as adult individuals may present more severe forms of the disease, the authors conclude that the implement of hepatitis A vaccination should be considered. Some Brazilian data have shown that the genotype found in our country were IA and IB. Isolates from this study were closely related genetically (or even identical) to isolates originating in other South American countries and overseas, providing firm evidence for epidemiological links between persons who travel to endemic areas. In spite of favorable environmental conditions, outbreaks of hepatitis E have never been reported in Brazil. Nevertheless, reports have demonstrated the evidence of anti-hepatitis E virus antibodies in some Brazilian regions. The seroprevalence of IgG anti-hepatitis E virus among normal populations shows positivities of 6.1% in gold-miners, 3.3% in general population, 2.0-7.5% in blood donors, 1.0% in pregnant women, and 4.5% in children, with no differences among regions. In populations at risk the prevalence of anti-hepatits E virus varies greatly. Among patients with acute non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis 2.1% was detected in the Southeast to 29% in the Northeast, in 10.6% of acute non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis relatives in the Amazon basin, in 12% of acute sporadic non-A non-B hepatitis patients in the Northeast, a co-infection with acute hepatitis A in 25 to 38% in the Northeast, in 14 to 18% among prostitutes and women considered at risk for human immunodeficiency virus in the Southeast, and in 12% of the intravenous drug users in the Southeast."
4210,0.005,1.0000,"Orally administered nucleus(t)ide analogues (NA) have brought about a simple, safe and effective therapeutic approach for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, treatment duration is long and some female patients become pregnant during treatment. In recent years, there have been gradually increasing reports on the safety of telbivudine (LdT) treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the third trimester of pregnancy to block mother-to-infant transmission (MTIT) of HBV; however, the safety of LdT treatment for chronic HBV infection for the entire pregnancy has not been reported. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety of LdT treatment for chronic HBV infection for the entire pregnancy and provide a reference for HBV-infected fertile women on how to block MTIT of HBV. Eighty-six pregnant women who received LdT treatment either before or in early pregnancy were enrolled in the study. Adverse events were prospectively observed for the entire pregnancy and perinatal period, and short-term and long-term follow-up of infants was conducted, monitoring the abnormalities of infants and blocking rate of MTIT with LdT treatment. Eighty-six pregnant women treated with LdT had a total of 89 pregnancies: 6 (6.7%) had early embryonic death or spontaneous abortion, 1 (1.1%) had ectopic pregnancy and three had a second pregnancy after initial abortion. Fifty-one mothers completed pregnancy: one had induction of labour at 24 weeks of pregnancy for cleft lip and palate of the foetus and 50 delivered 52 full-term live infants. One infant had right ear accessories, and the total occurrence of congenital abnormality was 3.8%. Thirty-nine infants were followed up for more than 6 months and completed all examinations for MTIT. None of the infants were HBsAg positive, resulting in a 100% success rate of blocking MTIT. All mothers maintained good liver function during the third trimester of pregnancy; 86% maintained complete virological response (HBV DNA <500 copies/mL) prior to delivery, and none developed progression of liver disease. Factors leading to increased adverse effects and drug resistance were not found. LdT treatment is safe and effective in chronic HBV-infected pregnant mothers for the entire pregnancy."
3603,0.005,1.0000,"Characterization of HIV-1 from slow progressors is important to facilitate vaccine and antiviral drug development. To identify virus attenuations that may contribute to slower rates of disease progression, the full-length viral genomes from primary isolates of six slow progressing HIV-positive children were sequenced. Proviral DNA was extracted from cocultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells and used to PCR amplify, sequence, and extensively analyze the near full-length genomes and LTR regions. All primary HIV-1 isolates were HIV-1 subtype C throughout their genome, and amino acid (AA) sequence analysis revealed open reading frames for all genes. However, all isolates had at least one unusual gene/protein. For example, isolate LT5 had a 2AA insertion in the Vpr mitochondriotoxic domain. Isolate LT21 contained an additional 5AA in the C-terminus of tat exon 2, while integrase in isolate LT39 had an additional 4AA at the C-terminus. Rev from isolates LT45 and LT46 did not have the characteristic subtype C 16AA truncation, and in addition, had a further 3AA. Furthermore, altered functional domains were noted in several isolates, such as the cAMP-dependent kinase PKA phosphorylation site in Nef (LT5), a Vpr mutation involved in decreased proapoptotic activity (all isolates), and the Nef ExxxLL motif involved in the interaction with AP-1 and AP-2 (LT46). The slower HIV-1 disease progression in these six children may be attributed to altered protein functions. For example, LT46 Nef is unable to bind AP-1 and AP-2 and therefore is inactive on CD4 endocytosis. The biological relevance of these findings requires further investigation."
7997,0.005,1.0000,"We analyzed the HIV-1 pol gene from patients in Cape Town to determine the genetic diversity of HIV-1 in the region and to assess the baseline HIV-1 resistance level of treatment-naive patients. Plasma was collected prior to the national antiretroviral therapy (ART) program. RNA was extracted, followed by RT-PCR and automated DNA sequencing of the viral protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding region. Genotyping was done through phylogenetic analysis. The sequences were inspected for resistance-associated mutations against PR and RT inhibitors. A total of 140 pol sequences were analyzed, of which 133 (95%) belong to HIV-1 subtype C, five (3.6%) were subtype B, and one each was subtype G and CRF02_AG. Five sequences (3.6%) had resistance-associated mutations. These include three (2.1%) NNRTI mutations. With the progression of the national ART program, it is important to monitor the resistance profile of naive and treatment-experienced patients."
1546,0.005,1.0000,"Genomic rearrangements in the 5' part of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) have been involved in multidrug resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTI). We carried out a retrospective, multicenter study to investigate the prevalence, variability, and phenotypic consequences of such rearrangements. Data concerning the HIV-1 RT genotype and the biological and clinical characteristics of NRTI-treated patients were collected from 10 virology laboratories. Sensitivities of the different HIV-1 variants to RT inhibitors were analyzed in a single-cycle recombinant virus assay. Fifty-two of 2,152 (2.4%) RT sequences had a rearrangement in the 5' part of the RT, with an extensive molecular variation. The number of codons inserted between positions 68 and 69 ranged from 1 (3 samples) or 2 (41 samples) to 5 and 11 in one case each. In four cases, codon 67 was deleted. High levels of phenotypic resistance to zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), abacavir (ABC), and didanosine (ddI) were found in 95, 92, 72, 62, and 15% of the 40 samples analyzed, respectively. Resistance to AZT, d4T, and ABC could be found in the absence of the T215Y/F mutations. Resistance to 3TC could develop in the absence of specific mutations. Low-level resistance to ddI was noticed in 40% of the patients. The deletions of codon 67 seemed to have little effect on NRTI sensitivity. Most of the rearrangements were shown to contribute to cross-resistance to NRTI. The results regarding susceptibility to ddI raise the question of the interpretation of the phenotypic data concerning this drug."
8848,0.005,1.0000,"Using the Southern blot technique and cloned hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA as a probe, we studied the state of HBV DNA in the liver of 13 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 17 patients with chronic hepatitis, and 2 patients with acute hepatitis. The hybridization results were compared with the serological and immunohistological data. Integration of HBV DNA in cellular DNA of the liver from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was demonstrated. In two patients from which tumorous and nontumorous liver tissue samples were available the integration patterns were different. In one patient with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive early hepatocellular carcinoma, free viral DNA was present in the liver. In some patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis, without tumor, integration of HBV DNA in cellular DNA was also demonstrated. This suggests that HBV is not the only factor involved in the development of a tumor. In patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis, free viral DNA was detected in the liver. In the two acute hepatitis patients analyzed, the restriction endonuclease patterns strongly suggested HBV DNA integration. Therefore, viral DNA integration seems to occur early in infection. Whatever the form of the disease, discrete bands were observed, suggesting the existence of limited and specific integration sites in host cellular DNA. The presence of integrated or free DNA sequences has implications for antiviral therapy. In addition, detection of HBV DNA in the liver is another sensitive viral marker that could be useful for diagnostic purposes."
1797,0.005,1.0000,"The new antiviral agent, azidothymidine (AZT; BW A509U), is currently the only successful drug in use for patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The effect of this thymidine analog, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, on the replication of the lymphadenopathy-associated virus strain of the human immunodeficiency virus was evaluated by using susceptible H9 and Jurkat cells. Cells were pretreated with concentrations of drug ranging from 0.5 to 100 microM, infected, and maintained in medium containing drug. Virus production was assayed by reverse transcriptase assays, and virus-specific DNA was analyzed by Southern blots probed with cloned human immunodeficiency virus sequences. At 4 to 8 days postinfection, infected cells without drug reached a peak of reverse transcriptase activity that was sustained. Increasing concentrations of AZT caused increasing delays in virus production; however, replicate cultures at nontoxic levels of the drug (up to 25 microM) eventually produced as much virus as did non-drug-treated infected cells, despite the continued presence of the drug. Levels of intracellular, unintegrated, virus-specific DNA paralleled reverse transcriptase levels. Virus-caused cytopathic effect was likewise delayed in drug-treated cultures. Virus recovered from H9 cultures after 25 microM AZT treatment did not appear resistant to AZT."
1265,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) terminates plus-strand DNA synthesis at the center of the HIV-1 genome, a process important for HIV-1 infectivity. The central termination sequence contains two termination sites (Ter1 and Ter2) located at the 3'-end of A(n)T(m) motifs, and the narrowing of the DNA minor groove generated by these motifs is responsible for termination. Kinetic data associated with the binding of RT and its ability to elongate in vitro various DNA duplexes and triplexes surrounding the Ter2 terminator were analyzed using a simple kinetic scheme. At Ter2, RT still displays a reasonable affinity for the corresponding DNA, but the binding of the next nucleotide and above all its incorporation rate are markedly hampered. Features affecting the width of the minor groove act directly at this last step. The constraint exerted against elongation by the A(n)T(m) tract persists at two positions downstream of the terminator."
1174,0.005,1.0000,"The recognition and precise cleavage of the polypurine tract (PPT) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is an essential step in HIV-1 reverse transcription. The accurate cleavage, and the subsequent removal, of the PPT by the RNase H activity of HIV-1 RT defines the left end of the double-stranded viral DNA genome, the substrate for integration into the host genome. Previous analyses have shown that mutations in the 3'-end (G-tract) of the PPT cause alterations in RNase H cleavage specificity. In particular, mutations at positions 2 and 5 in the G-tract increased the frequency of retention of PPT sequences in the 2-LTR circle junction. To better understand why these mutations affected PPT cleavage in vivo, we analyzed the cleavage of PPT substrates in vitro that contained altered sequences and unusual base substitutions. Our results, herein, confirm that mutations at positions 2 and 5 of the G-tract do significantly alter the cleavage specificity at the PPT/U3 junction, and further suggest that the miscleavages observed in vivo were due to an improper generation of the PPT primer, as opposed to its improper removal. Finally, our results point to the structure of the PPT, rather than the base-specific contacts between the PPT and HIV-1 RT, as the primary determinants of RNase H cleavage specificity at the PPT/U3 junction."
9387,0.005,1.0000,"Measurement of quality of life is crucial to assess the full impact of antiretroviral therapy on patient morbidity. No quality of life instruments have been validated in an Asian HIV-infected patient population, but it is important to do so given the increasing involvement of the region in clinical trials. We set out to validate the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) in HIV infected patients in Singapore. Clinically stable outpatients were asked to complete the 30-item MOS-HIV (English or Chinese translation). Patients were also asked about the frequency of selected disease symptoms, and clinical and demographic data were recorded from the case sheet. 163 patients (90% Chinese, 96% male, mean age 38 years, mean CD4 count 159 cells/mm(3)) participated in the study and completed the questionnaire to a satisfactory standard. The questionnaire showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >0.7 in all cases). There were significant differences in quality of life scores between Centers for Disease Control disease stages, and significant correlations with CD4 count and symptom score, confirming the discriminant validity of the MOS-HIV. Factor analysis revealed two components corresponding to physical and mental health which were similar to those of studies in Western countries except that pain was more closely related to mental than physical health. Linear regression analysis identified symptom burden as the major predictor of physical and mental health. We concluded that the MOS-HIV is a valid measure of quality of life in this HIV patient population in Singapore, and is therefore likely to be useful in future clinical trials in the region. In the era of chronic HIV disease, close attention to symptoms (disease or drug-related) is warranted due to their major adverse influence on mental and physical aspects of quality of life."
3886,0.005,1.0000,"Low-level viremia due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) was demonstrated in the sera of two patients diagnosed previously as having non-B, non-C chronic hepatitis. Both patients had a ""silent"" HBV infection, because they were negative for both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis B core antibody. The TaqMan chemistry polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified the HBV DNA, enabling quantitation of the virus in their sera. Their serum HBV DNA concentrations were low: the amount of each HBV S or X gene amplified showed there were approximately 10(3) copies/ml and HBV DNA was detected occasionally during clinical follow-up. Positive HBsAg staining in liver tissues was demonstrated by an immunoperoxidase technique. Vertical transmission of silent HBV from one patient to her daughter was confirmed. Direct nucleotide sequencing of the amplified HBV X region revealed several mutations, suggesting reduced viral replication. One patient had a T-to-C mutation at the extreme 5'-terminus of the direct repeat 2 region and the other exhibited a coexisting X region with a 155-nucleotide deletion. These findings suggest that HBV replication is suppressed considerably in patients with silent hepatitis B."
2120,0.005,1.0000,"Mutations in the precore region of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been associated with failure of expression of HBV e-antigen (HBeAg), however, the prevalence of these and other mutations in HBV carriers without overt chronic liver disease remains uncertain. Homosexual or bisexual males (n = 65) with chronic HBV infection attending The Middlesex Hospital, London were studied, of whom two had clinical evidence of chronic liver disease. HBV DNA was amplified from 62 of 65 serum samples using nested and double nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Direct sequencing of the PCR products was employed to investigate sequence variation. HBV-DNA from all available HBeAg-negative (n = 9) and selected HBeAg-positive (n = 33) sera were sequenced in the entire precore gene, the 3' terminal portion of the X gene (aa128-154), and the 5' terminus of the core gene (aa18-73). Sequences were highly conserved in all regions studied. Samples from two anti-HBe-seropositive patients contained mutations in the precore region. In one, a single mutation in the first amino acid resulted in a change to leucine, which would prevent translation of this region and therefore HBeAg expression. Wild type sequences were also detected in this sample. In the other sample from a patient with overt chronic liver disease, a mutation of precore amino acid 28 changed a tryptophan residue to a stop codon which would also prevent HBeAg expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We analyzed the HBV DNA pre-C region in five members of a Turkish family. The mother presented an anti-HBe (+) CAH-B and the four children different hepatitis B virus serological and clinical profiles. The pre-C region was analyzed by cloning after DNA amplification in sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A method for rapid screening of a large number of cloned polymerase chain reaction products was developed for the presence of the most frequent pre-C mutations (G to A substitution at nucleotide position 1896 and 1899). At least 60 independent clones were tested for each patient by selective oligonucleotide hybridization using non-mutated (M0), one (M1) and two (M2) point-mutated probes. Results were confirmed by sequencing. The mutation 1896 was present in 91% of DNA clones from the mother. The same mutation was also found in 85% of the clones in the youngest child (D), but in less than 10% of the clones from children A and C. Only the pre-C wild-type strain was observed in child B. X gene deletions (3 to 20 nt) were also present in some clones from the mother and children A, B and C.

766,0.005,1.0000,"There is no consensus regarding the specific management of HIV-associated nephrotic syndrome. We report a child whose first manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was nephropathy and wasting syndrome associated with profound immunodeficiency. The patient had a dramatic clinical and immunologic response to triple antiretroviral therapy delivered through a gastrostomy tube, with complete resolution of nephrotic syndrome. A 51/2-year-old African-American girl presented with a 2-week history of cough, chest pain, vomiting, loose stools, abdominal distention, anorexia, and fever. In addition, she had recurrent oral thrush. Her weight and height were below the 5th percentile. She was chronically ill, appearing with oropharyngeal thrush and pitting edema in lower extremities. She had scattered rhonchi and decreased breath sounds on both lung bases. Her abdomen was distended and diffusely tender. A chest radiograph showed consolidation of the right upper and left lower lobes with bilateral pleural effusion. Admission laboratories were consistent with nephrotic syndrome. Streptococcus pneumoniae grew from the blood culture and the child responded well to treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone. She was found to be HIV-infected, her CD4(+) cell count was 3 cells/mcL and her plasma HIV-1 RNA was >750 000 copies/mL. A percutaneous gastrostomy tube was placed for supplemental nutrition. She was treated with stavudine, lamivudine, and nelfinavir via gastrostomy tube with good clinical response. Twenty-one months after instituting antiretroviral therapy, her weight and height had increased to the 50th and 10th percentile respectively, and she had complete resolution of her nephrotic syndrome. Her CD4(+) cell count increased to 1116 cells/mcL and her viral load has remained undetectable. HIV-1 associated nephrotic syndrome has been described in children with profound immunodeficiency. The course of untreated HIV-associated nephrotic syndrome is rapid progression to renal failure in up to 40% of the children. Regardless of the presence of renal insufficiency, if untreated, it is uniformly fatal. A modest improvement of HIV-1 associated nephrotic syndrome has been observed in patients treated with zidovudine. Steroid and cyclosporine treatment have resulted in improved renal function but long-term use of immunosuppressive therapy has raised concerns about safety. We have described, to our knowledge, the first child with HIV-associated nephrotic syndrome who had a remarkable clinical, immunologic, and virologic response to triple-drug combination therapy given by gastrostomy tube, with complete resolution of proteinuria and normalization of the serum albumin. She also had a striking improvement in weight, height, and quality-of-life. Whether the presence of a gastrostomy tube contributed to the excellent response because of improved compliance is unknown, but warrants systematic evaluation."
3642,0.005,1.0000,"We conducted a large-scale survey to determine the frequency and clinical significance of mutations in the pre-core region of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sera from 263 patients with chronic HBV infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified HBV DNA. Four major missense/nonsense mutations (M) were found: (M1) C-->T at nucleotide position 1856, Pro-->Ser at codon 15; (M2) G-->A at position 1896, Trp-->stop at codon 28; (M3) G-->A at position 1898, Gly-->Ser at codon 29; and (M4) G-->A at position 1899, Gly-->Asp at codon 29. The commonest conserved mutation was M0: T-->C at position 1858, Pro-->Pro at codon 15. We found that M1 and M2 were mutually exclusive, M3 was only found in association with M1, and M4 was predominantly found in association with M2. All patients with M1 but none of those with M2 had M0. The invariable coexistence of certain mutations in codon 15 and codons 28 and 29 and the mutual exclusion of other mutations in these two noncontiguous regions is related to the stem-loop structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence located in the precore/core region. M2 and M4 enhance the stability of the stem by providing two additional paired sites. M1 destroys an existing base pair. However, M1 only occurred in the presence of M0, which provides an extra paired site, and 50% of patients with M1 had M3, a compensatory mutation that restores base pairing at this site. Our data support the proposed secondary structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence. The primary function of the mutations in the pre-core region is to enhance stability of this secondary structure to ensure perpetuation of viral replication."
2007,0.005,1.0000,"Neutropenia occurs in approximately 17% of symptomatic patients infected with HIV. Results of studies have failed to demonstrate a consistent relationship between HIV-related neutropenia and the subsequent development of bacterial infections. This was a case control study to determine if HIV-related neutropenia was associated with increased rates of bacteremia. The experimental group was comprised of 29 patients infected with HIV that had an absolute neutrophil count less than 1000 cells/mm3 and were paired with 29 control subjects infected with HIV that had been matched for age, sex, CD4 count, and month and year of entry. The frequency of bacteremia was 12.6 per 100 patient months among the experimental group compared to a frequency of 0.87 per 100 patient months among the control group (relative risk [RR] = 14.9, P = 0.0027). Other independent risks for the development of bacteremia included central venous catheters (RR = 3.9, P = 0.03), with a trend toward increased risk for bacteremia in those patients who were intravenous drug users (RR = 3.8, P = 0.11), or who had infiltrative bone marrow disease (RR = 3.1, P = 0.11). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that neutropenia (odds ratio [OR] = 22.6, P = 0.028) and the presence of a central venous catheter (OR = 8.5, P = 0.026) were significant risks for bacteremia. These data suggest that neutropenia is a significant risk for the development of bacteremia in patients infected with HIV."
9699,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 sequences in intravenous drug user (IDU) networks are highly homogenous even after several years, while this is not observed in most sexual epidemics. To address this disparity, we examined the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolutionary rate on the population level for IDU and heterosexual transmissions. All available HIV-1 env V3 sequences from IDU outbreaks and heterosexual epidemics with known sampling dates were collected from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database. Evolutionary rates were calculated using phylogenetic trees with a t test root optimization of dated samples. The evolutionary rate of HIV-1 subtype A1 was found to be 8.4 times lower in fast spread among IDUs in the former Soviet Union (FSU) than in slow spread among heterosexual individuals in Africa. Mixed epidemics (IDU and heterosexual) showed intermediate evolutionary rates, indicating a combination of fast- and slow-spread patterns. Hence, if transmissions occur repeatedly during the initial stage of host infection, before selective pressures of the immune system have much impact, the rate of HIV-1 evolution on the population level will decrease. Conversely, in slow spread, where HIV-1 evolves under the pressure of the immune system before a donor infects a recipient, the virus evolution at the population level will increase. Epidemiological modeling confirmed that the evolutionary rate of HIV-1 depends on the rate of spread and predicted that the HIV-1 evolutionary rate in a fast-spreading epidemic, e.g., for IDUs in the FSU, will increase as the population becomes saturated with infections and the virus starts to spread to other risk groups."
874,0.005,1.0000,"Whether critically ill human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are at risk of acquiring nosocomial infections and resistant or potentially resistant microorganisms (RPRMs) remains to be clarified. The aim was to compare the acquisition of RPRMs, infections and mortality in critically ill HIV-infected and non-infected patients. An observational, prospective cohort study of patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) was undertaken. Swabbing of nares, pharynx and rectum, and culture of respiratory secretions were obtained within 48 h of admission and thrice weekly thereafter. Clinical samples were obtained as deemed necessary by the attending physician. Clinical variables, severity scores on admission and exposures during ICU stay were collected. Logistic regression was used to evaluate ICU mortality. Out of the 969 included patients, 64 (6.6%) were HIV-infected. These patients had a higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score on admission (19.5 ± 6.6 vs. 21.1 ± 5.4, p = 0.02), stayed longer in the care unit and were more exposed to several invasive devices and antibiotics. There were no differences in the rate of acquisition of RPRMs and the only difference in ICU-acquired infections was a significantly higher incidence of catheter-related bacteraemia (3% vs. 9%, p = 0.03). The ICU-related mortality was similar in both groups (14% vs. 16%, p = 0.70) and in HIV-infected patients, it tended to be associated with a lower CD4 cell count (p = 0.06). Despite a longer ICU stay, critically ill HIV-infected patients did not show a higher rate of RPRMs acquisition. The rate of ICU-acquired infection was similar between HIV-infected and non-infected patients, except for catheter-related bacteraemia, which was higher in the HIV-infected population. Mortality was similar in both groups."
7141,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cognitive impairment, a significant cause of morbidity, affects up to 30% of HIV-infected people. Its prevalence doubled as patients began to live longer after the introduction of highly active retroviral therapy. Women are now one of the fastest growing groups with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States and Puerto Rico, but relatively little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of cognitive dysfunction in HIV-infected women. In this study the authors investigated its prevalence in a group of HIV-1-seropositive Hispanic women in Puerto Rico. Forty-nine women with a nadir CD4 cell count of < or = 500 cells/mm3 were enrolled. Cognitive impairment was defined according to the American Academy of Neurology criteria for HIV dementia as modified to identify an ""asymptomatic cognitively impaired"" group. Observed prevalence was compared with prevalence in other populations in United States, Europe, and Australia. Differences in clinical markers and neuropsychological test performance among the cohort stratified by cognitive impairment were tested. Cognitive impairment was observed in 77.6% (38/49) of cases; asymptomatic cognitive impairment in 32.7% (16/49); minor cognitive motor disorders in 16.3% (8/49); and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in 28.6% (14/49). Cognitive impairment did not correlate with age, CD4 cell count, viral load, or treatment modality. The cross-sectional prevalence of HIV-associated cognitive impairment was 77.6% (28.6% for HAD). These findings should enhance awareness of the prevalence of HIV-associated cognitive impairment, both clinically apparent and ""asymptomatic,"" in Hispanic women and lead to improvements in areas such as education and compliance and to reevaluation of treatment interventions."
9007,0.005,1.0000,"We hypothesized that rapid presentation may be a general feature of tuberculosis (TB) associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that limits the impact of HIV on the point prevalence of TB. To investigate this, we performed a cross-sectional HIV and TB disease survey with retrospective and prospective follow-up. HIV prevalence among 1,773 systematically recruited miners was 27%. TB incidence was much more strongly HIV associated (incidence rate ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-8.6) than the point prevalence of undiagnosed TB disease (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9-3.3). For smear-positive TB, 7 of 9 (78%) prevalent cases were HIV negative, and point prevalence was nonsignificantly lower in miners who were HIV positive (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1-4.2). The calculated mean duration of smear positivity before diagnosis (point prevalence/incidence) was substantially shorter for HIV-positive than HIV-negative TB patients (0.17 and 1.15 years, respectively; ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.00-0.73). HIV has considerably less impact on the point prevalence of TB disease than on TB incidence, probably because rapid disease progression increases presentation and case-finding rates. The difference in mean duration of smear positivity was particularly marked and, if generalizable, will have major implications for TB control prospects in high HIV prevalence areas."
6883,0.005,1.0000,"The Transfusion Safety Study (TSS) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) established a repository of approximately 200,000 sera from blood donors in late 1984 and early 1985. Collections were made in the four metropolitan areas with the highest prevalence of AIDS. Retrospective testing showed an overall anti-HIV-1 prevalence of 16 cases per 10,000 donations. In this study, the predictive value of a negative initial enzyme-linked immunoassay was estimated from both quality control specimens and the rescreening of 13,461 sera to be greater than 99.99 percent with respect to technical error. Among anti-HIV-1-positive persons, there was a 1.3- to 1.5-fold excess of first-time donors. The anti-HIV-1 prevalence among donors showed that infection was more common among young men than suggested by national reporting of AIDS cases. Anti-HIV-1 prevalence varied among the four metropolitan areas less than did reported AIDS cases, but, by 1987, the differences in the latter had decreased. Anti-HIV-1 prevalence in collection areas outside of the four major cities differed much more widely than that among the cities themselves. The TSS/NHLBI Donor Repository will remain available for the indefinite future for further evaluation of screening procedures for HIV-1 and other viruses for which transfusion is found to be an important route of transmission."
8320,0.005,1.0000,"This study shows first data on HTLV-1/2 seroprevalence among pregnant women in the non-endemic region of Argentina. In a retrospective study a representative sample (n = 3,143) of the pregnant women registered in the health public service in the province of Córdoba was evaluated. HTLV-1/2 seroprevalence was 0.191% +/- 0.0857 [IC 0.022-0.359]. This prevalence was 10 times higher in pregnant women than in blood donors [0.019 (4/21.183)]. The pregnant women would reflect the epidemiology of the general population more accurately since it constitutes a more heterogeneous group than that of blood donors. The prevalence of infection with HIV was 2.8 times higher than that of HTLV-1/2 (P < 0.05) and the presence of any of these two viruses was not a subrogating indicator of the presence of the other (Goodman and Kruskal's Tau coefficient = 0.0092). The prevalence of HBV was not significantly different from that of HTLV-1/2 (P > 0.05). We consider that it is necessary to carry out continuous studies in order to define the main risk factors for infection of these women. Thus, a decision could be made to apply the best policy in public health to prevent vertical transmission of the virus in Argentina."
351,0.005,1.0000,"This paper's design is descriptive and correlational based on retrospective self-report survey data collected in Kunming city, China. The study investigated the difference between a group of Chinese HIV positive (N=36) and negative (N=131) opioid dependent adults maintained on methadone treatment. Comparisons were based on their quality of life (QOL), methadone treatment adherence, adverse symptom occurrence related to methadone treatment, and HIV-related behavior changes. No significant differences were found between the two groups in age, methadone maintenance dose, methadone adherence, sex desire, and drug craving level. Participants who were HIV positive reported significantly lower scores on physical health and total health-related qualify of life. They also reported greater engagement in injection related risk behavior before methadone treatment than those who tested HIV negative. For both groups, sexual and injection risk behavior significantly decreased following initiation of methadone treatment. A regression model revealed that those infected with HIV, associated significantly with higher likelihood of reporting constipation and lack of appetite, and higher frequency of reporting abdominal pain and nausea than HIV negative patients. The primary implication of these findings is that HIV positive persons in methadone treatment may require more focused services to meet their special HIV care and substance treatment needs."
8477,0.005,1.0000,"Despite mandatory antibody testing, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be transmitted from HIV-infected blood that is seronegative. The objective of this study was to estimate the probability of HIV-infected blood donations during the seronegative ""window period"" in a northern Thailand HIV epicenter. Thus, a retrospective cohort of repeat blood donors was created. With the assumptions that the probability of HIV seroconversion is distributed uniformly between the last HIV-negative and the first HIV-positive donation and that the seronegative window is 45 days, the rate of window-period donations was calculated by multiplying the incidence by the window duration. Of 11,232 repeat donors, 273 seroconverted during 9,518,863 person-days of observation (i.e., a window-period donation rate of 1/775). There were more window-period donations among 21- to 30-year-old men and in donors replacing blood of friends or relatives. Additional measures are needed to reduce the high number of HIV-infected window-period donations."
9266,0.005,1.0000,"We performed a 3-year retrospective study of Streptococcus pneumoniae blood culture isolates recovered at Baragwanath Hospital, Soweto, South Africa, from 1993 to 1995. The study group comprised 457 patients, including 98 children, of known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serostatus. Of these patients, 70 (30 [8.4%] of 359 adults and 40 [40.8%] of the 98 children) were infected with penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains (minimal inhibitory concentration, > or = 0.12 microg/mL); 56 of these strains were intermediately resistant to penicillin. HIV-positive patients had significantly more penicillin-resistant isolates than did HIV-negative patients (43 [29.7%] of 145 HIV-positive patients vs. 27 [8.6%] of 312 HIV-negative patients; P < .001); this difference was found for both adults (19% vs. 4.3%; P < .001) and children (53.3% vs. 30.2%; P < .0343). Multiple resistance occurred more frequently in HIV-positive children (P = .02). HIV-positive adults had a statistically significant increase in the percentage of serogroups and serotype usually found in children and commonly associated with antimicrobial resistance, i.e., serotype 14 and serogroups 6, 19, and 23 (48% vs. 28.6%; P < .001). The increased prevalence of serogroups or serotypes usually found in children was also found among penicillin-susceptible strains. These data suggest that HIV-infected adults may again become susceptible to the serogroups or serotypes found in children."
5228,0.005,1.0000,"Jamaica has the second highest number of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases and deaths in the Caribbean and a significant number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals have a concomitant sexually transmitted infection (STI). The study determined the prevalence of non-ulcerative and ulcerative STIs and their association with sexual risky behaviour in a sample of HIV seropositive men and women. This study was conducted at the Comprehensive Health Centre in Jamaica, a sexually transmitted infection referral centre. The sample comprised 138 men and 132 women age 15-49 years, of average 29.5 years. The study was retrospective, from 2000 to 2002, and sample collection was randomized. The sexual behaviours of the subjects were assessed from the case records. In the 270 HIV diagnosed cases examined, the prevalence of STIs was 51.1% in men and 48.9% in women, with 85.4% having one or more STIs with an average of four STIs per patient. There was a total occurrence of 744 STIs with non-gonococcal urethritis (19.4%), gonorrhoea (17.2%), candidiasis (13.4%), trichomonas (12.4%), genital ulcer (10.4%) and syphilis (7.3%) the most common in HIV infected men and women. The presence of STI was associated with continued practice of risky sexual behaviour. The age group most implicated was the 30-34 year old, and 73.1% of the HIV infected patients had multiple sexual partners with only 16.4% reporting frequent condom use. The study demonstrates that there is a high prevalence of non-ulcerative and to a lesser extent ulcerative STIs in HIV infected patients in Jamaica. There are significant associations between STIs and continued high risk sexual practices in HIV infected men and women. The findings support the need for implementation of effective diagnosis and treatment strategies coupled with education about safe-sex practices in HIV prevention and STI control programmes."

From February 1, 2000 to April 30, 2001, specimens from 6,805,010 units of serologically negative donation were screened in minipools of 50 samples within 24 hr after blood donation by NAT using multiplex HBV/HCV/HIV-1 reagent for blood transfusion including short shelf-life platelets. Among them, 112 HBV DNA-positives, 25 HCV RNA positives and 4 HIV-1 RNA positives were screened out and we could prevent transfusion of these NAT positive units. Subtypes/genotypes of HBV DNA, adr/C, adw/A, adw/B, adw/C, ayr/C and ayw/D were found and adr/C was predominant. A total of 61.6 % of them (69/112) were negative by overnight EIA. Sixth three of HBV NAT-positive samples carried virus loads less than 10(4) copies/mL and 92.1 % of them (58/63) were negative by overnight EIA. The virus growth curves of HBV in 6 cases obtained by retrospective and prospective follow-up study showed exponential straight lines in the early stage of serological window periods and the log times of HBV growth (10 fold increase) in serological window period were between 4.6 and 7.6 days. NAT screening with highly sensitive reagents in pool of specimens is useful to exclude blood units with low level of HBV and HBV mutants from blood transfusion."
540,0.005,1.0000,"Puerto Rico has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS seen for any US state or territory, and antiretroviral therapy has been a mainstay of efforts to mitigate the HIV/AIDS public health burden on the island. We studied the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 mutation and antiretroviral drug resistance in Puerto Rico by monitoring the population frequency of resistance-associated mutations from 2002 to 2011. Whole blood samples from 4,475 patients were analyzed using the TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit and OpenGene DNA Sequencing System in the Immunoretrovirus Research Laboratory at Universidad Central del Caribe. Results show that 64.0% of female and 62.9% of male patients had HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to at least one antiretroviral medication. L63P and M184V were the dominant mutations observed for the protease (PRO) and reverse transcriptase (RT) encoding genes, respectively. Specific resistance mutations, along with their associated drug resistance profiles, can be seen to form temporal clusters that reveal a steadily changing landscape of resistance trends over time. Both women and men showed resistance mutations for an average of 4.8 drugs over the 10-year period, further underscoring the strong selective pressure exerted by antiretrovirals along with the rapid adaptive response of HIV. Nevertheless, both female and male patients showed a precipitous decrease for overall drug resistance, and for PRO mutations in particular, over the entire course of the study, with the most rapid decrease in frequency seen after 2006. The reduced HIV-1 mutation and drug resistance trends that we observed are consistent with previous reports from multi-year studies conducted around the world. Reduced resistance can be attributed to the use of more efficacious antiretroviral drug therapy, including the introduction of multi-drug combination therapies, which limited the ability of the virus to mount rapid adaptive responses to antiretroviral selection pressure."
6196,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global health problem and an important cause of morbidity and mortality from sequelae of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the past decades, better understanding of the natural history and immunopathogenesis of chronic HBV infection and of the development of many powerful antiviral agents has allowed us to improve therapeutic efficacy. Among these agents, nucleos(t)ide analogs are important and potent viral suppressors. However, when administered alone, they are not able to permanently eradicate HBV, and long-term maintenance therapy is required for therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, prolonged treatment is frequently associated with the emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants. Before an 'ideal' drug(s), or drug combination, with optimal antiviral efficacy and negligible rates of drug resistance becomes available, the on-treatment monitoring approach using serum HBV DNA level as a predictor for therapeutic efficacy and drug resistance is useful. However, most countries in the Asia-Pacific region have low income economies, insufficient medical care systems, and low awareness of the disease among the general population and government officers. The easy approach of the road-map concept using an affordable drug to treat chronic HBV infection is more important in this region. There is already evidence that the long-term outcomes of chronic HBV infection can be improved under well-managed antiviral therapy. Profound and long-lasting suppression of HBV replication, either maintained on-therapy or sustained after stopping therapy, has been identified as the key determinant for achieving the goals of therapy, for reducing liver damage, and for preventing development of cirrhosis and/ or hepatocellular carcinoma."
8868,0.005,1.0000,"The World Health Organization developed a set of human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance (HIVDR) early warning indicators (EWIs) to assess antiretroviral therapy clinic and program factors associated with HIVDR. EWIs are monitored by abstracting data routinely recorded in clinical records, and the results enable clinics and program managers to identify problems that should be addressed to minimize preventable emergence of HIVDR in clinic populations. As of June 2011, 50 countries monitored EWIs, covering 131 686 patients initiating antiretroviral treatment between 2004 and 2009 at 2107 clinics. HIVDR prevention is associated with patient care (appropriate prescribing and patient monitoring), patient behavior (adherence), and clinic/program management efforts to reduce treatment interruptions (follow up, retention on first-line ART, procurement and supply management of antiretroviral drugs). EWIs measure these factors and the results have been used to optimize patient and population treatment outcomes."
2031,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is more prevalent than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but more public health resources are allocated to HIV than to HCV. Given shared risk factors and epidemiology, we compared accuracy of health beliefs about HIV and HCV in an at-risk community. Between 2002 and 2003, we surveyed a random patient sample at a primary care clinic in New York. The survey was organized as domains of Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation: causes ('sharing needles'), timeline/consequences ('remains in body for life', 'causes cancer') and controllability ('I can avoid this illness', 'medications may cure this illness'). We compared differences in accuracy of beliefs about HIV and HCV and used multivariable linear regression to identify factors associated with relative accuracy of beliefs. One hundred and twenty-two subjects completed the survey (response rate 42%). Mean overall health belief accuracy was 12/15 questions (80%) for HIV vs 9/15 (60%) for HCV (P < 0.001). Belief accuracy was significantly different across all domains. Within the causes domain, 60% accurately believed sharing needles a risk factor for HCV compared to 92% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the timeline/consequences domain, 42% accurately believed HCV results in lifelong infection compared to 89% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the controllability domain, 25% accurately believed that there is a potential cure for HCV. Multivariable linear regression revealed female gender as significantly associated with greater health belief accuracy for HIV. Thus, study participants had significantly less accurate health beliefs about HCV than about HIV. Targeting inaccuracies might improve public health interventions to foster healthier behaviours and better hepatitis C outcomes."
2301,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can be successfully treated using nucleos(t)ide analogs (NA), but drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants frequently arise, leading to treatment failure and progression to liver disease. There has been much research into the mechanisms of resistance to NA and selection of these mutants. Five NA have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of CHB; it is unlikely that any more NA will be developed in the near future, so it is important to better understand mechanisms of cross-resistance (when a mutation that mediates resistance to one NA also confers resistance to another) and design more effective therapeutic strategies for these 5 agents. The genes that encode the polymerase and envelope proteins of HBV overlap, so resistance mutations in polymerase usually affect the hepatitis B surface antigen; these alterations affect infectivity, vaccine efficacy, pathogenesis of liver disease, and transmission throughout the population. Associations between HBV genotype and resistance phenotype have allowed cross-resistance profiles to be determined for many commonly detected mutants, so genotyping assays can be used to adapt therapy. Patients that experience virologic breakthrough or partial response to their primary therapy can often be successfully treated with a second NA, if this drug is given at early stages of these events. However, best strategies for preventing NA resistance include first-line use of the most potent antivirals with a high barrier to resistance. It is important to continue basic research into HBV replication and pathogenic mechanisms to identify new therapeutic targets, develop novel antiviral agents, design combination therapies that prevent drug resistance, and decrease the incidence of complications of CHB."
4361,0.005,1.0000,"Smoking is common in patients with HIV and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. With the goal of targeting future cessation interventions, we sought to identify factors associated with smoking status, readiness and confidence in cessation, and success in quitting. As part of a larger study in New York City assessing predictors of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we enrolled HIV-infected subjects at least 35 years of age without known asthma or COPD. Current smokers received detailed tobacco history, and smoking status was assessed by chart review at 3 and 6 months post-enrollment. Two hundred subjects were enrolled (29% current smokers, 31.5% never smokers, 39.5% former smokers, mean age of 49, 84% male, 64% had AIDS, and 97% were receiving antiretroviral therapy). Current smokers had higher unemployment and increased rates of other substance use than former smokers or never smokers. In multivariate analysis, being unemployed and having used inhalant drugs were associated with current smoking. Substance abuse history was not correlated with readiness to quit or patient estimated cessation. Lower education was associated with decreased readiness to quit. Follow-up smoking status for baseline current smokers was available for 47/58 enrollees at 6 months; 4 (9%) stopped smoking completely, and 17 (36%) decreased the number of packs-per-day. Smoking and concomitant substance abuse is common in HIV, and special attention should be given to this issue, in addition to a patient's readiness to quit, when implementing tobacco cessation protocols, especially in busy urban HIV care centers."
1677,0.005,1.0000,"This seroprevalence report examines serologic evidence of hepatitis B immunization or infection and associated demographic/behavioral factors in adolescent (aged 12-20) subjects enrolled in a nontherapeutic clinical trial at 43 Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) clinical centers. Subjects (n = 94) infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through sexual activity were categorized as hepatitis B virus (HBV)-immunized, HBV-infected, or nonimmune by hepatitis B serology performed on specimens collected within the subject's first 48 weeks on study (1993-1995). Sixteen percent of the 94 serologically classified subjects were immunized; 19% HBV-infected; 65% nonimmune. Of the three risk factor scores examined (sociodemographic, sexual, and substance abuse), substance use alone demonstrated a significant difference among groups (despite virtually no reported injecting drug behavior), with the sexual risk score exhibiting marginally significant differences. Logistic regression analysis (restricted to nonimmunized subjects) showed that male-male sexual activity raised the odds of HBV infection by a factor of 5.14 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45-18. 23) relative to heterosexual activity; and that for every one point increase on the substance abuse risk scale the odds of infection increased 5% (95% CI: 0.99-1.10). The HBV infection rate in PACTG 220 HIV-positive females is twice United States population-based rates; the rate in PACTG 220 HIV-positive males is nearly seven times higher. Past immunization efforts in this population appear to have been based on sexual activity volume without regard to injecting-drug use in sex partners."
438,0.005,1.0000,"Multiple mechanisms are used by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to interfere with host-cell immune effector functions. The 27-kD Nef protein has been shown to down-modulate specific genes of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) on the surface of infected primary T cells, facilitating their escape from lysis by cytolytic T lymphocytes. Macrophages, as the other major immune cell type targeted by the virus, also contribute to the transmission, persistence, and pathogenesis of HIV-1. Yet, whether Nef modulates MHC-I expression on HIV-infected primary macrophages remains unclear. Currently available infectious HIV-1 molecular clones, which express a reporter gene, only infect T cells and/or do not express Nef. To overcome these limitations, we generated macrophage-tropic green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged HIV-1 viruses, which express the complete viral genome, and used these to assess the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 on the surface of productively infected macrophages. The reporter viral genomes were replication-competent and stable, as Nef, p24 antigen, and GFP expression could be detected by immunostaining of infected, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after more than 2 months postinfection. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses of infected macrophages and T cells revealed that although wild-type reporter virus infection induced a statistically significant decrease in the density of surface HLA-A2, down-regulation of HLA-A2 was not seen in cells infected with reporter viruses encoding a frameshift or a single point mutation in Nef at prolines 74P and P80. The impact of Nef on HLA-A2 surface expression in MDM was also confirmed by confocal microscopy. These results suggest that the mechanisms of HLA-A2 down-modulation are similar in primary T cells and macrophages."
5797,0.005,1.0000,"Microglia represent the main cellular targets of HIV-1 in the brain. Infected and/or activated microglia play a pathogenic role in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) by instigating primary dysfunction and subsequent death of neurons. Although microglia are known to secrete neurotoxins when infected with HIV-1, the detailed mechanism of neurotoxicity remains unclear. Using a human microglia primary culture system and macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains, we have now demonstrated that HIV-1 infection of microglia resulted in a significant increase in extracellular glutamate concentrations and elevated levels of neurotoxicity. RNA and protein analysis revealed upregulation of the glutamate-generating enzyme glutaminase isoform glutaminase C in HIV-1-infected microglia. The clinical relevance of these findings was further corroborated with investigation of postmortem brain tissues. The glutaminase C levels in the brain tissues of HIV dementia individuals were significantly higher than HIV serum-negative control and correlated with elevated concentrations of glutamate. When glutaminase was subsequently inhibited by siRNA or by a small molecular inhibitor, the HIV-induced glutamate production and the neuronal loss was diminished. In conclusion, these findings support glutaminase as a potential component of the HAND pathogenic process as well as a novel therapeutic target in their treatment."
5187,0.005,1.0000,"During the past decade, AIDS has become a global health problem with 182,000 cases reported from 152 countries. It is estimated that nearly five to ten million people are infected worldwide with the etiologic agent of AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). With a mean incubation period from time of infection to the development of AIDS of eight to ten years, it is projected that nearly all HIV-1-infected individuals will develop AIDS within the next 15 years. In the United States alone, 104,210 cases of AIDS and more than 61,000 deaths have been reported. Sexual, parenteral, and perinatal transmission routes have remained the major modes of transmission, although the proportion of cases within each risk behavior category has changed. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion of patients with AIDS who have acknowledged either IV drug use or heterosexual contact with other individuals at high risk for HIV infection. Inner-city minority populations are disproportionately represented among AIDS patients, and HIV-seroprevalence studies demonstrate significantly higher rates of infection among blacks and Hispanics compared with whites, even within the same risk category. In 1988, the US Public Health Service estimated that approximately 1.0 to 1.5 million Americans were currently infected with HIV-1 and that by the end of 1992, a cumulative total of 380,000 cases of AIDS will be diagnosed. In 1992, 80,000 cases of AIDS may be diagnosed, with 66,000 deaths occurring during that year alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3066,0.005,1.0000,"The results of an epidemiological survey in Spain organized by the ""Spanish Pediatric Association"" of children born to HIV+ mothers from 1981-1989 are presented. The objectives were, a) to document in the different parts of Spain the number of HIV+ children born to HIV+ mothers, and b) to identify the risk factors involved in the HIV infection. Only in public hospitals, a total of 1938 HIV+ children born to HIV+ mothers were identified. A systematic yearly increase of HIV+ newborns was evident since 1985. Madrid, Catalonia, Valencia, Basq and Andalucia communities incorporated 85% of all cases. 93% of mothers were IVDU and 51% of them were married. Prematurity occurred in 27% of cases and low birth weight in 33% of NB's. The rate of transmission in children over 18 months of age was 25.6% Breast feeding could be a risk factor in the transmission of HIV infection observed in children over 18 months of age. No other maternal risk factors responsible for the HIV transmission were identified. 12% of children died with AIDS. Clinical classification and evolution of HIV infection did not significantly differ from similar studies in other parts of the world. In spite of only public hospitals being involved, Spain has more identified HIV+ children than Italy, Switzerland, Federal Republic of Germany, United Kingdom, Sweden and Belgium combined. The pediatric centres with large number of cases require interdisciplinary pediatric specialized units to cope with the increase demand of medical services, now inadequate and insufficient. To fight drug use and HIV infection in Spain, health education and family support, are indispensable in trying to arrest the continuous spread the HIV infection."
6475,0.005,1.0000,"Health care workers are exposed daily to blood borne injury and infection with a high risk of hepatitis B or C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. In the 1980s, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a set of protocols and guidelines known as standard precautions (SP) to prevent accidental transmission of pathogens. The SP should be followed for each intervention or delivery of care in order to protect health care workers from risks associated with contact with blood and other biological liquids. A survey was conducted in a Western Algerian university hospital to assess nurses' adherence to SP practices. A questionnaire was administered to 450 nurses in the hospital workplace setting. A field survey was also conducted in order to take into account the means and support available to the nurses in these hospital departments, namely to determine availability of hand washing and drying facilities. A total of 133 nurses, 81 women and 52 men, participated in the survey. Personal and professional data, hand-washing frequency, glove wearing practices were collected as data. A large majority (95%) of nurses reported washing their hands after removing their gloves, and 69% of them reported washing their hands between two patients. Male nurses wear gloves more often than females (respectively 77% and 53%). Sharp instruments were correctly disposed of in a puncture-resistant container more of the time. Recapping needles has been reported by two-thirds of survey respondents. Lack of liquid soap and alcohol-based washing solution were noted as major deficiencies as well as the lack of means to properly dry hands in many health care wards. Lack of SP adherence is primarily due to the lack of awareness and knowledge as well as insufficient supply of equipment and materials for good hand hygiene maintenance. This study highlights the urgent need to implement a programme to improve SP adherence among nurses and to increase the supply of hand washing and drying materials. Greater adherence to SP practices will also reduce the risk of occupational exposure to blood borne injury and infection."
983,0.005,1.0000,"In addition to a direct anti-viral effect, interferons have important immunological properties including effects on cell-mediated immunity and antibody production as well as cell-mediated cytolysis. In chronic hepatitis B virus infection the host immune system is important for the elimination of replicating virus and in addition to directly inhibiting hepatitis B virus replication, interferons may affect host immune responses. We investigated the effect of lymphoblastoid interferon in vitro on lymphocyte activation and cell-mediated cytolysis in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The proliferative response to the mitogen PHA was significantly impaired in patients compared to controls. In addition supernatants of cultured mononuclear cells from patients stimulated with PHA contained less interleukin-2 activity than controls while the proportion of stimulated mononuclear cells expressing the interleukin-2 receptor was also reduced in patients. Prior incubation with 10(3) U ml-1 lymphoblastoid interferon increased both interleukin-2 activity and interleukin-2 receptor expression in patients and controls, although in patients the response was less marked. In contrast the proliferative response was unaffected. Natural killer cell activity against K562 cells was similar in patients and controls which in both groups was significantly augmented by prior incubation with 10(3) U ml-1 lymphoblastoid interferon; the increase was inversely proportional to baseline activity. In contrast incubation of target or effector cells with interferon did not augment T-cell cytotoxicity against autologous hepatocytes. The effects of lymphoblastoid interferon in vitro, were modest, but subtle changes in immunological status in addition to a direct effect on viral replication may be relevant to eventual clearance of the hepatitis B virus."
9737,0.005,1.0000,"The role of infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in terms of survival among dialysis patients remains incompletely understood. In the present multicenter prospective cohort study, we investigated the prevalences of HBV and HCV infection among 3,321 patients receiving maintenance dialysis in Korea, and assessed the impacts of these infections on survival. All included patients underwent hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg) and HCV antibody (Ab) testing, which revealed that 236 patients (7.1%) were HBsAg-positive, and 123 patients (3.7%) were HCV Ab-positive. HBsAg-positive and HCV Ab-positive patients were matched to hepatitis virus-negative patients using a propensity score at a ratio of 1:2. The prevalences of HBV and HCV infection did not significantly differ according to dialysis modality. Linear-by-linear association analysis revealed that hepatitis B prevalence significantly increased with increasing dialysis vintage (p = 0.001), and hepatitis C prevalence tended to be higher with increasing dialysis vintage (p = 0.074). We compared the survival of HBsAg-positive and HCV Ab-positive patients to that of hepatitis virus-negative patients. After propensity score matching, cumulative survival did not differ between HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative patients (p = 0.37), while HCV Ab-positive patients showed significantly lower survival than HCV Ab-negative patients (p = 0.03). The main conclusions of the present study are that HBV infection prevalence increased with longer dialysis vintage, and that both HBV and HCV infections were most prevalent among patients with the longest dialysis vintage. Additionally, HCV infection among maintenance dialysis patients is associated with an increased risk of mortality. "
2500,0.005,1.0000,"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a crucial role in the early recognition of pathogenic microorganisms and provides an ideal model to investigate the consequences of genetic variation and susceptibility to diseases. The present study investigated the occurrence of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs4986790 (A>G) and rs4986791 (C>T) in the TLR4 gene in chronic carriers of the hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses. A total of 420 blood samples were collected (HBV, 49; HCV, 72; and controls, 299) at the liver disease outpatient clinic of Hospital da Fundação Santa Casa de Misericórdia do Pará (FSCMPA). Genomic DNA extracted from leukocytes was subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis to identify the genetic profile of the participants. No significant differences were found in the allele and genotype frequencies between the infected participants and controls. No significant associations were found between the investigated polymorphisms and inflammatory activity, fibrosis, and the presence of cirrhosis; the same results were obtained in the haplotype analysis. The results showed a lack of association between the rs4986790 and rs4986791 SNPs and susceptibility to infection with HBV and HCV, as well as clinical and laboratory information of the patients. "
2789,0.005,1.0000,"Nucleot(s)ide analogues and peginterferon (PEG-IFN) treatment are the only approved therapies for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, complete eradication of the virus, as indicated by persistent loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), is rare among treated patients. This is due to long-term persistence of the HBV genome in infected hepatocytes in the form of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). In this study, we investigated whether administration of a large dose of a nucleoside analogue in combination with PEG-IFN can achieve long-term loss of HBsAg in human hepatocyte chimeric mice. Mice were treated with a high dose of entecavir and/or PEG-IFN for 6 weeks. High-dose combination therapy with both drugs resulted in persistently negative HBV DNA in serum. Although small amounts of HBV DNA and cccDNA (0.1 and 0.01 copy/cell, respectively) remained in the mouse livers, some of the mice remained persistently negative for serum HBV DNA at 13 weeks after cessation of the therapy. Serum HBsAg and hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) continued to decrease and eventually became negative at 12 weeks after cessation of the therapy. Analysis of the HBV genome in treated mice showed accumulation of G-to-A hypermutation and CpG III island methylation. Persistent loss of serum HBV DNA and loss of HBV markers by high-dose entecavir and PEG-IFN combination treatment in chimeric mice suggests that control of HBV can be achieved even in the absence of a cellular immune response."
8422,0.005,1.0000,"The sera of 36 French patients with post-transfusional and sporadic non-A, non-B (NANB) chronic hepatitis were investigated, with a combination of serological and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, for HBV and HCV infections. Eighty-nine percent of the patients were found positive with serological and/or molecular tests. Among the positive patients, 68% (22/32) were found positive for both anti-HCV and HCV-RNA, 16% (5/32) and 16% (5/32) were found positive only for anti-HCV or HCV-RNA, respectively. HBV-DNA sequences were detected in two patients associated to the HCV viraemia. This study confirms the extremely high prevalence of HCV infection in NANB chronic hepatitis in France. It also shows the possible co-infection by HCV and HBV in NANB hepatitis. We have also determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5' non-coding, E1, E2/NS1 and NS3/NS4 regions of a French isolate using the polymerase chain reaction. Comparison of these nucleotide sequences with those available from American and Japanese isolates showed a significant genetic variability. The genetic variability is higher in the E2/NS1 (13 to 33% and 12 to 30% at the nucleic acid and amino acid level, respectively) than in the E1 (10 to 28% and 7 to 21%) and NS3/NS4 (5 to 21% and 2 to 7%) regions. The sequence of the French isolate is more closely related to that of the American HCV prototype than to the Japanese HCV isolates. This study confirms the extent of HCV genetic variability."
1177,0.005,1.0000,"Patients dually infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV)/hepatitis B virus (HBV) have a higher risk of developing advanced liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma compared with monoinfected patients. Yet, there is a similar rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) after peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin combination therapy in these patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients and a high hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance rate. The durability of hepatitis C and B clearance in coinfected patients was investigated in a 5-year follow-up study. Patients with active HCV genotype 1, both HBV-coinfected (n = 97) and HBV-monoinfected (n = 110), underwent 48-week combination therapy with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin. In patients with active HCV genotype 2 or 3, both HBV-coinfected (n = 64) and monoinfected (n = 50) patients underwent 24-week combination therapy. A total of 295 (91.9%) patients completed treatment and 24 weeks posttreatment follow-up; 264 (89.5%) patients agreed to receive additional follow-up for up to 5 years after the end of treatment. After a median follow-up of 4.6 ± 1.0 years, six of the 232 patients achieving SVR developed HCV RNA reappearance, including five HCV genotype 1/HBV-coinfected patients and one HCV genotype 2/3-monoinfected patient. Subgenomic analysis of the HCV core gene indicated that five patients developed delayed recurrence of HCV infection. Overall, the cumulative recurrence rate of HCV infection was 2.3% (0.4%/year; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9%-5.5%). The cumulative HBsAg seroclearance rate was 30.0% (95% CI, 21.5%-42.0%); with 33.1% (95% CI, 21.8%-50.1%) in the 48-week combination therapy group and 24.3% (95% CI, 13.7%-42.9%) in the 24-week therapy group."
6755,0.005,1.0000,"The study aimed to clarify clinical significance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) rtA181S mutation in Chinese HBV-infected patients. A total of 18 419 patients with chronic HBV infection from Beijing 302 Hospital were investigated. HBV complete reverse transcriptase region of polymerase was screened by direct sequencing, and the results were verified by clonal sequencing. Replication-competent mutant and wild-type HBV genomic amplicons were constructed and transfected into the HepG2 cells and cultured in the presence or absence of serially diluted nucleos(t)ide analogues. Intracellular HBV replicative intermediates were quantitated for calculating the 50% effective concentration of the drug (EC(50)). The rtA181S was detected in 98 patients with 12 kinds of mutational patterns. Genotype C and genotype B HBV infection occupied 91.8% and 8.2% in rtA181S-positive patients, in contrast to 84.6% and 15.4% in rtA181S-negative patients (P < 0.01). All rtA181S-positive patients had received nucleos(t)ide analogues. rtA181S was detected in multiple patients with virologic breakthrough. Phenotypic analysis of patient-derived viral strains showed that rtA181S, rtA181S+N236T, rtN236T and rtA181V strains had 68.5%, 49.9%, 71.4% and 66.2% of natural replication capacity of wild-type strain, and 3.7-fold, 9.8-fold, 7.9-fold and 5.6-fold increased EC(50) to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). The rtA181S strain remained susceptible to lamivudine, entecavir and tenofovir, and ADV susceptibility was restored after the mutation was eliminated through site-directed mutagenesis. Rescue therapy with entecavir or combination therapy was effective in rtA181S-related ADV-refractory patients. The rtA181S mutation confers moderate resistance to ADV. It could be induced by either lamivudine or ADV and contribute ADV treatment failure."
2603,0.005,1.0000,"This study investigated clinical implications of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) I and II haplotypes, in combination with HBV sub-genotype C2, in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in northeastern China. Here, HLA haplotypes of 230 HBV-infected patients were compared to 210 healthy, unrelated Han individuals. Of the 230 HBV-infected patients, 54 had acute self-limited hepatitis (ASH) with sub-genotype C2 (ASH-C2), 144 had chronic hepatitis (CH) with sub-genotypes C2 and B2 (CH-C2 and CH-B2), and 32 spontaneously recovered without sub-genotype results. All groups underwent HLA typing and haplotype analysis. The results revealed that A*02-DRB1*12 and A*02-B*15-DRB1*09 carriers were susceptible to HBV infection. A*02-B*15-DRB1*09 is probably associated with acute onset and viral clearance and A*02-DRB1*12, with viral persistence. In HBV infections, B*40-DRB1*12 was associated with HBV persistence, whereas B*46-DRB1*09, A*24-DRB1*14, and B*15-DRB1*04 carriers easily recovered from the disease. By contrast, when infected with the HBV-C2 sub-genotype, A*24-DRB1*14, B*15-DRB1*04, A*02-B*15, A*02-DRB1*15, and A*02-B*15-DRB1*09 carriers displayed an acute clinical course before recovery. This study reveals a relationship between HLA haplotypes and HBV pathogenesis, thereby providing potential therapeutic targets to treat HBV infection. "
2719,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is known to show significant genetic diversity. There are eight HBV genotypes (A-H) characterized by distinct geographical distribution. Mutations in the HBV genome, in particular precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutations, may be important factors in the pathogenesis of disease. In this study genetic heterogeneity and phylogenetic analysis of HBV isolates from 32 naïve patients with acute HBV infection was investigated. Eleven patients presented with severe infection, while the remaining 21 had self-limiting illness. Only four isolates from patients with severe HBV infection harbored the G1896A stop codon mutation. One isolate (Irish-13), collected from a patient with acute asymptomatic infection, had a G1896A mutation and a 243 bp deletion of the polymerase gene. A triple mutation, T1753C/A1762T/G1764A was identified in only one isolate (Irish-3) associated with severe infection. The latter also had a mutation, A2339G, in the core gene, not previously reported in severe acute infection caused by genotype D. Variations within the S gene were identified in 6 isolates, including Gly145Ala, associated with vaccine immune escape, Asp144Glu, Ser143Leu and Phe134Leu, each associated with failure to detect HBsAg. Phylogenetic analysis was determined using amplicons of the S gene (678 bp) and distal-X/PC region (672 bp). Genotype A was the most common (75%), followed by genotype D (15.6%), and equal proportions of C, E, F, and H. A novel recombinant of genotypes D and E was identified in an isolate originating from West Africa. Genetic heterogeneity of HBV isolates of HBV isolates from patients with acute infection needs further study of its significance."
2964,0.005,1.0000,"An important driving force behind the sequence diversity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is viral adaptation to host immune responses. To gain an insight into the impact of host immunity on genetic diversification and properties of HBV, we characterized HBV of genotype D from treatment-naive hepatitis B e antigen-positive (EP) and hepatitis B e antigen-negative (EN) patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), where HBV is under stronger immune pressure, with that of HBV derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV-coinfected individuals, where HIV infection has significantly weakened the immune system. Full-length sequence analysis showed that HBV heterogeneity was most extensive in EN-CHB followed by EP-CHB and HIV/HBV coinfection. The relative magnitude of non-synonymous changes within B-cell epitopes was greater than that in T-cell epitopes of HBV open reading frames (ORFs) in both EP-CHB and EN-CHB. Nine amino acid substitutions were identified in B-cell epitopes and one in a T-cell epitope of HBV in EN-CHB, most of which resulted in altered hydrophobicities, as determined using the Kyte and Doolittle method, relative to wild-type residues found in HBV from the HIV-positive group. Additionally, 19 substitutions occurred at significantly higher frequencies in non-epitope regions of HBV ORF-P in EN-CHB than HIV/HBV-coinfected patients. In vitro replication assay demonstrated that the substitutions, particularly in reverse transcriptase and RNaseH domains of ORF-P, resulted in a decline in replication capacity of HBV. Hence, our results indicate that HBV adapts to increasing immune pressure through preferential mutations in B-cell epitopes and by replicative attenuation. The viral epitopes linked to immune response identified in this study bear important implications for future HBV vaccine studies."
510,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes chronic infection in more than 350 million people worldwide. It replicates in hepatocytes but is non-cytopathic; liver damage is thought to be immune mediated. Here, we investigated the role of innate immune responses in mediating liver damage in patients with chronic HBV infection. Longitudinal analysis revealed a temporal correlation between flares of liver inflammation and fluctuations in interleukin (IL)-8, interferon (IFN)-alpha, and natural killer (NK) cell expression of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) directly ex vivo. A cross-sectional study confirmed these findings in patients with HBV-related liver inflammation compared with healthy carriers. Activated, TRAIL-expressing NK cells were further enriched in the liver of patients with chronic HBV infection, while their hepatocytes expressed increased levels of a TRAIL death-inducing receptor. IFN-alpha concentrations found in patients were capable of activating NK cells to induce TRAIL-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro. The pathogenic potential of this pathway could be further enhanced by the ability of the IFN-alpha/IL-8 combination to dysregulate the balance of death-inducing and regulatory TRAIL receptors expressed on hepatocytes. We conclude that NK cells may contribute to liver inflammation by TRAIL-mediated death of hepatocytes and demonstrate that this non-antigen-specific mechanism can be switched on by cytokines produced during active HBV infection."
9637,0.005,1.0000,"Since 1996, AIDS has declined in the Italian population, but cases in foreign patients, including both recent immigrants and long-term residents, have increased from 3.9% in 1995-1996 to 15.4% in 2001-2002. This increase can only be partly explained by a higher migratory flow and might reflect a delayed access to health facilities and to antiretroviral therapy in migrants. We performed a survey for the year 2003 of HIV-infected immigrants to Italy from countries outside the European Union to verify which factors might influence a lack of access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Italian centers of infectious diseases were requested to send sociodemographic and clinical data of HIV-infected immigrant patients. A total of 553 HIV-infected immigrants (49.9% women) were evaluated, representing 6.5% of all HIV-infected patients from these centers. The mean duration of residency in Italy was 6.6 +/- 5.0 years. The country of origin was Africa (64.5%), North and South America (24.2%), Eastern Europe (7.0%), and Asia (3.8%). A total of 407 of 553 patients (73.6%) were taking antiretroviral drugs at the time of screening. Females presented a younger age (p = 0.001), a lower frequency of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stage B/C (p = 0.008) and a more frequent heterosexual exposure to HIV (p < 0.001), while no differences were observed for time of first positive serology (p = 0.7). CD4 cell count (p = 0.9) and log plasma HIV-RNA (p = 0.1). Characteristics of HAART patients were compared to those of nontreated patients, despite a CD4 cell count less than 350 cells/mm(3). No significant difference was found for gender, country of origin, risk factor, and years of Italian residence, while legal immigrants (p = 0.018) and registered in the National Health Service (p = 0.014) were significantly more likely to receive HAART compared to illegal immigrants."
8073,0.005,1.0000,"We investigated the association between plasma HIV-1 RNA, immune activation, and polyclonal T cell function in viremic subjects whether on or off antiretroviral therapy (ART). The surface expression of activation/functional molecules on T cells and monocytes as well as cytokine secretion and T cell proliferation were assessed in 23 HIV-1(-) and 79 HIV-1(+)-infected subjects with different levels of viral suppression and CD4(+) T cell count >250 cells/mm(3) for >6 months. Viral replication was associated with increased T cell and monocyte activation irrespective of ART. In subjects with a detectable viral load on ART, we found a positive association with anti-CD3/CD28-induced T cell proliferation compared to patients with undetectable viral load (<400 copies/ml). No difference among groups was observed for anti-CD3/CD28-mediated IFN-gamma responses. The presence of an unexpected positive association between polyclonal T cell proliferation and viral load in subjects with levels of T cell IFN-gamma responses comparable to those of uninfected subjects is of potential relevance to an increase in T cell activation response before the loss of polyclonal cytokine secretion and proliferation observed with disease progression. This finding suggests that T cell hyperresponsiveness may play a role in the pathogenesis of immune comorbidities on ART."
3989,0.005,1.0000,"This study was conducted to better understand the prognostic factors influencing the disease progression and mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in a high-middle-income country. This registry-based retrospective cohort study was conducted in Tehran from April 2004 to March 2014. We enrolled 2473 HIV-infected patients who had a medical record in Behavioral Diseases Counseling Centers. The outcomes of interest were the estimation of time: (1) from HIV diagnosis to AIDS progression and (2) from AIDS to AIDS-related death. The 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year probability of disease progression from HIV diagnosis to AIDS was 45.0%, 69.9%, and 90.4%, and that of AIDS-related death was 17.2%, 30.3%, and 39.2%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that AIDS progression was significantly associated with male sex (P = 0.022), an increase in age (P = 0.001), low educational levels (P = 0.001), and a decreased level of CD4 cell count (P = 0.001). Furthermore, the AIDS-related mortality was significantly associated with male sex (P = 0.010), tuberculosis coinfection (P = 0.001), and antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.001). The results of this study indicated that progression to AIDS and AIDS-related death is affected by several modifiable and non-modifiable predictors. We indicated that a substantial proportion of the HIV-positive people were unaware of their status and were diagnosed very late. This hidden source of HIV infection had the opportunity to transmit the infection to other people. "
3810,0.005,1.0000,"Within human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients, there are those who have been infected for more than 10 years with a CD4+ cell count of >500 cells microl(-1) and who remain asymptomatic without antiretroviral therapy; these patients are designated long-term non-progressors (LTNPs). In a set of 16 LTNPs, viral dating, DNA viral load, quasispecies heterogeneity and antibody (Ab) titres against gp160 and beta2 microglobulin (beta2m) were determined. Plasma viral RNA and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell numbers were estimated in more than three samples per patient. Host genetic characteristics, such as Delta32-CCR5 genotype and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype and supertypes, and clinical-epidemiological factors were evaluated. Dating of global populations and of DNA and RNA viral quasispecies identified two subsets of patients: one displaying only ancestral sequences and the other displaying predominantly modern sequences. The ancestral patients displayed a significant reduction in RNA and DNA viral loads, quasispecies heterogeneity, CD8+ cell number, anti-gp160 Ab titres and beta2m level, and they were also associated with better use of safe-sex practices and higher presence of the HLA sB58 supertype than the modern subset. Viral dating has therefore permitted the segregation of LTNPs into two subsets that show very different virological, immunological, host and clinical-epidemiological characteristics. Moreover, whereas the modern subset displayed low levels of virus replication, the ancestral group displayed not only a very limited virus replication, often to undetectable levels, but also very slow or arrested viral evolution, maintaining the close relationship of the viral population to the transmitted virus."
5348,0.005,1.0000,"In subjects infected with HIV, proteinuria could represent a marker of HIV associated nephropathy (HIVAN), the most important cause of chronic renal failure in them. To determine the prevalence of proteinuria in children with HIV infection and to improve the screening of renal disease for these children in our country, we conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study over a 3-month period. We included 122 children (0-14 years old) with HIV infection followed at CHUP-CDG. Proteinuria was calculated using the first morning urine sample by dipstick test (significant for a ""+"" or more). Statistical tests were significant for p < 0.05. The 122 children (121 HIV1 and 1 HIV2) comprised of 64 boys and 58 girls. Eighteen (14.8%) (14 boys and 4 girls) had proteinuria (1 or 2 ""+""). The mean age of patients with proteinuria was 10.4 ± 3.3 years. None of the children were hypertensive. All were infected with HIV1. Proteinuria was associated with microscopic hematuria in six cases. The average CD4 count was 21 ± 8% versus 23 ± 10% in 42 patients without proteinuria (p = NS). The mean serum creatinine in patients with proteinuria was 47 ± 29 μmol/l. Three of them had acute renal failure. All patients with proteinuria had antiretroviral treatment (ARV) since 40 ± 24 months versus 36 ± 26 months in 98 patients without proteinuria. No treatment included tenofovir, indinavir, or converting enzyme inhibitor. The prevalence of proteinuria in our sample is lower than that reported by other African writers in untreated subjects. This fact suggests a nephroprotection of ARV in our patients probably treated early and effectively. However, microalbuminuria, a possible early marker of HIVAN, has not been evaluated by our study. Studies of the prevalence of microalbuminuria in children infected with HIVand treated with ARVs in Sub-Saharan African countries should be encouraged. They would help to determine the relevance in these children of research routinely of microalbuminuria and to screen and precociously take care of a possible HIVAN or other chronic glomerulopathy."
4972,0.005,1.0000,"The surveillance of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) through case reporting only reflects the epidemiologic features of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) transmission a few years earlier and not the prevalence of HIV seropositivity. HIV infection is not a notifiable condition in Quebec. We were asked by the ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux du Québec to perform a pilot project for the surveillance of HIV seropositivity using a network of sentinel physicians. From May 15, 1988, to Sept. 30, 1989, physicians from four collaborating centres collected data on the serologic status, demographic characteristics and risk factors for 4209 patients who underwent HIV antibody testing. Of the 3899 subjects included in the study 7.9% were HIV positive. Through logistic regression analysis the following variables were found to be significantly associated with HIV seropositivity: presence of HIV-related symptoms (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 36.5), origin from an endemic area (POR 9.1), homosexuality or bisexuality (POR 8.4), intravenous drug use (POR 4.2), male sex (POR 2.8), previous HIV antibody testing (POR 2.5) and previous sexually transmitted disease (POR 1.8). Over the study period we found a large increase in HIV seroprevalence among intravenous drug users (4.2% in 1988 to 19.0% in 1989) (p = 0.02). This increase might reflect a recent change in the epidemiologic pattern of HIV transmission in Quebec. Surveillance of HIV seropositivity through a network of sentinel physicians may be a reasonable alternative to mandatory reporting."

First line treatment had failed in 12 out of 33 patients (36%) receiving anti-HBV drugs. The 12 patients with persistent viraemia were all lamivudine (LAM) experienced and 7 had a polymerase sequencing test available. LAM substitution mutations L180M + M204V/I were found in six out of seven cases, with an accompanying V173L mutation in three cases. These mutations were also related with changes in HBsAg.

Of the 110 strains, 85 were classified into six HIV-1 PR subtypes, A (n = 1), B (n = 1), F (n = 4), G (n = 7), H (n = 1), and J (n = 7), and a circulating recombinant form, CRF02-AG (n = 64). PR genes from the remaining 25 (23%) specimens were unclassifiable, whereas 2% (7 of 301) unclassifiable PR sequences were reported for a global collection. Two major PI resistance-associated mutations, 20M and 24I, were detected in strains from only two specimens, whereas secondary mutations were found in strains from all samples except one strain of subtype B and two strains of CRF02-AG. The secondary mutations showed the typical PI resistance-associated pattern for non-subtype B viruses in both classifiable and unclassifiable PR genes, with 36I being the predominant (99%) mutation, followed by 63P (18%), 20R (15%), 77I (13%), and 10I or 10V (11%). Of these mutations, dual and triple PI resistance-associated substitutions were found in 38% of all the Cameroonian strains. Compared with classifiable PR sequences, unclassifiable sequences had significantly more dual and triple substitutions (64% versus 30%; P = 0.004). Phenotypic and clinical evaluations are needed to estimate whether PI resistance during antiretroviral drug treatment occurs more rapidly in individuals infected with HIV-1 strains harboring multiple PI resistance-associated substitutions. This information may be important for determination of appropriate drug therapies for HIV-1-infected persons in Cameroon, where more than one-third of HIV-1 strains were found to carry dual and triple minor PI resistance-associated mutations."

We characterized the diversity and catalytic efficiency of HCV NS3/4A protease quasispecies in AHC patients coinfected with HIV-1. Plasma samples obtained at HCV diagnosis from 18 MSM HIV-coinfected patients with AHC were studied. Five HCV monoinfected patient samples with AHC were also investigated. An average of 39 clones from each sample was analysed. The catalytic efficiency of the dominant quasispecies (i.e. the most abundant) from each quasispecies was also assayed for mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) cleavage. Phylogenetic analysis identified two clusters of patients with highly related viruses, suggesting a common source of HCV infection. None of the 18 MSM HIV-coinfected patients spontaneously cleared HCV, although 78% of the treated patients achieved a sustained virological response after early treatment with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) plus ribavirin (RBV). The synonymous-nonsynonymous (ds/dn) mutation ratio, a marker of selective pressure, was higher in AHC compared to 26 HIV-1-infected men with genotype 1a chronic hepatitis C (CHC) (P < 0.0001). NS3/4A proteases from AHC patients also exhibited higher catalytic efficiency compared to CHC patients (P < 0.0001). No differences were found when ds/dn mutation ratios and NS3/4A protease catalytic efficiencies from AHC HIV-coinfected patients were compared with AHC monoinfected patients. The presence of epidemiological networks of HCV transmission was confirmed among HIV-1-positive MSM. In addition, substantial genetic diversity was demonstrated in AHC. NS3/4A protease efficiency cleaving MAVS may be associated with virus transmission and response to pegIFN/RBV treatment."
2640,0.005,1.0000,"Immunovirologic parameters of 24 heavily antiretroviral drug-pretreated patients with prolonged virologic treatment failure under highly active antiretroviral therapy, and who harbored highly resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates, were studied in this retrospective cross-sectional study. Most of the patients were injecting drug users (71%) and male (88%). All patients were studied for CD4(+) cell count, HIV viral load, resistance mutations, and viral phenotype. The patients showed a high accumulation of resistance-associated mutations, their CD4(+) cell count and viral load directly correlated with their respective values at initiation of therapy, and the presence of K103N was inversely associated with lower viral load. On the other hand, patients with K103N had the same level of CD4(+) cell count compared with patients without this mutation. Among the patients, a majority with a specific viral phenotype was not present. Rather, a dual-tropic virus was found most frequently, suggesting a preferential suppression of X4-specific strains and less cytopathogenicity during antiretroviral therapy and a greater proportion of R5X4 viruses due to an adaptation to that pressure."
6693,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 infection causes a severe T-cell impairment with alteration of immune response. However, in children the natural decline of lymphocytes and CD4 cells in early life makes it more difficult to monitor immunocompetence and progression of HIV-infection. Aim of this study was to characterize the CD8 response in non-vertically HIV-infected children exposed persistently to viremia and in HIV-infected children controlling efficiently viremia by ART, by analysing the effect of persistent viremia on CD4 and CD8 T-cells count, HIV-specific immune-response and naive/memory pattern of CD8 T-cell. Whereas, no differences of CD4 count between viremic patients and viral controllers were observed (1046.9 +/- 472.1 cells/microl vs 1101.3 +/- 415.4 cells/microl; p > 0.05), CD8 count was higher in the viremic patients (1080.6 +/- 652.1 cells/microl vs 747.5 +/- 389.9 cells/microl, p < 0.05). In viremic patients, HIV-specific CD8 T-cells correlated with viral load. However, in this group a loss of HIV-specific CD8 response was associated with a 7 fold decrease of naïve and increase of pre-effector CD8 T-cells (62.8% +/- 10.21% vs 10.37% +/- 7.91%, p < 0.03). Persistent exposure to viremia alters HIV-specific CD8 response possibly through a persistent immune activation process leading to exhaustion of naive CD8 T-cells and skewed maturation of memory subset. Therefore, memory CD8 T-cells might lose the ability to respond correctly and efficiently to HIV-antigen exposure."
8784,0.005,1.0000,"Pigtailed macaques infected with a virulent human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) strain develop renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which morphologically resembles aspects of human HIV-associated TMA. Apoptotic cell death of microvascular endothelial cells might be a pathogenetic clue to this disease. For defining further the pattern of cellular injury in this model, serial kidney sections of 58 macaques infected with HIV-2 and 7 uninfected controls were studied by routine microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, and immunohistochemistry for single-stranded DNA, p53, the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1 peptide product, caspase-3, and the proliferation marker Ki67. Selected cases were further evaluated by in situ end labeling and transmission electron microscopy. Kidneys of 13 HIV-2-infected animals contained a pattern of cellular injury, which was characterized by (1) nuclear swelling with an ultrastructural morphology different from apoptotic nuclei, (2) sharply demarcated areas of renal cells with chromatin nicks (TUNEL positive) and single-stranded DNA, (3) absence of an inflammatory or proliferative response, (4) upregulation of p53 and loss of at least one cellular differentiation marker (Wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1), (5) a tight correlation with the diagnosis of renal TMA, and (6) a contrast between profound changes in the renal cellular morphology and the apparently unaffected clinical condition of the host. This pattern of injury, which shares some features of both apoptotic and oncotic necrosis, might be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated renal TMA in this model."
5582,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can manipulate the microRNA (miRNA) regulatory networks in infected cells to create a permissive environment for viral replication, cellular injury, disease onset, and its progression. The aim of the present study was to understand the miRNA networks and their target genes in the liver of hepatitis B patients involved in HBV replication, liver injury, and liver fibrosis. We investigated differentially expressed miRNAs by microarray in liver biopsy samples from different stages of HBV infection and liver disease (immune-tolerant [n = 8], acute viral hepatitis [n = 8], no fibrosis [n = 16], early [F1+F2, n = 19] or late [F3+F4, n = 14] fibrosis, and healthy controls [n = 7]). miRNA expression levels were analyzed by unsupervised principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering. Analysis of miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks identified 17 miRNAs and 18 target gene interactions with four distinct nodes, each representing a stage-specific gene regulation during disease progression. The immune-tolerant group showed elevated miR-199a-5p, miR-221-3p, and Let-7a-3p levels, which could target genes involved in innate immune response and viral replication. In the acute viral hepatitis group, miR-125b-5p and miR-3613-3p were up, whereas miR-940 was down, which might affect cell proliferation through the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway. In early fibrosis, miR-34b-3p, miR-1224-3p, and miR-1227-3p were up, while miR-499a-5p was down, which together possibly mediate chronic inflammation. In advanced fibrosis, miR-1, miR-10b-5p, miR-96-5p, miR-133b, and miR-671-5p were up, while miR-20b-5p and miR-455-3p were down, possibly allowing chronic disease progression. Interestingly, only 8 of 17 liver-specific miRNAs exhibited a similar expression pattern in patient sera."
3156,0.005,1.0000,"Many individuals chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) experience a recrudescence of plasma virus during continuous combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) due either to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses or to poor compliance. In most cases, virologic failure on ART is associated with a coincident decline in CD4(+) T lymphocyte levels. However, a proportion of discordant individuals retain a stable or even increasing CD4(+) T lymphocyte count despite virological failure. In order to address the nature of these different outcomes, we evaluated virologic and immunologic variables in a prospective, single-blinded, nonrandomized cohort of 53 subjects with chronic HIV-1 infection who had been treated with continuous ART and monitored intensively over a period of 19 months. In all individuals with detectable viremia on ART, multiple drug resistance mutations with similar impacts on viral growth kinetics were detected in the pol gene of circulating plasma virus. Further, C2V3 env gene analysis demonstrated sequences indicative of CCR5 coreceptor usage in the majority of those with detectable plasma viremia. In contrast to this homogeneous virologic pattern, comprehensive screening with a range of antigens derived from HIV-1 revealed substantial immunologic differences. Discordant subjects with stable CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts in the presence of recrudescent virus demonstrated potent virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. In contrast, subjects with virologic failure associated with declining CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts had substantially weaker HIV-specific CD4(+) T lymphocyte responses and exhibited a trend towards weaker HIV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. Importantly the CD4(+) response was sustained over periods as long as 11 months, confirming the stability of the phenomenon. These correlative data lead to the testable hypothesis that the consequences of viral recrudescence during continuous ART are modulated by the HIV-specific cellular immune response."
8379,0.005,1.0000,"In contrast to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected humans, natural hosts for simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) very rarely progress to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). While the mechanisms underlying this disease resistance are still poorly understood, a consistent feature of natural SIV infection is the absence of the generalized immune activation associated with HIV infection. To investigate the immunologic mechanisms underlying the absence of AIDS in SIV-infected sooty mangabeys (SMs), a natural host species, we performed a detailed analysis of the SIV-specific cellular immune responses in 110 SIV-infected SMs. We found that while SIV-specific T-cell responses are detectable in the majority of animals, their magnitude and breadth are, in fact, lower than what has been described in HIV-infected humans, both in terms of cytokine production (ie, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2) and degranulation (ie, CD107a expression). Of importance, SIV-specific T-cell responses were similarly low when either SIVmac239-derived peptides or autologous SIVsmm peptides were used as stimuli. No correlation was found between SIV-specific T-cell responses and either viral load or CD4+ T-cell count, or between these responses and markers of T-cell activation and proliferation. These findings indicate that the absence of AIDS in naturally SIV-infected sooty mangabeys is independent of a strong cellular immune response to the virus."
2178,0.005,1.0000,"Co-infection by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is common. HIV co-infection worsens the course of HCV infection, particularly in patients with low CD4-cell count, enhancing the need to cancel HCV replication in HIV-infected patients. We report a case of spontaneous recovery of chronic HCV-infection in a HCV-HIV co-infected hemophiliac with the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy and immune restoration. Retrospective analysis of frozen blood samples showed that a decrease in HCV-RNA in parallel with the increase of CD4 and CD8-cell counts, accompanied by a peak of transaminases. The respective effect of immune restoration and of high doses of ritonavir are discussed."
536,0.005,1.0000,"Soluble factors with inhibitory activity against type 1 Human Immunodeficiency Virus The pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection is a complex process that depends on multiple factors, including viral and host immune and genetic characteristics. This leads to a variable pattern of disease progression among those HIV-1-exposed individuals who become infected, while there are a number of individuals who remain healthy and HIV-1 seronegative despite being serially exposed to HIV-1. These variable outcomes of HIV-1 exposure suggest that there are mechanisms of natural resistance to HIV-1 infection. Although several genetic and adaptive immune mechanisms of resistance have been reported in some exposed seronegative and long-term non-progressor individuals, the mechanisms involved in controlling the establishment and progression of HIV-1 infection are not fully understood. Several soluble factors, such as defensins, chemokines, interferons and ribonucleases, among others, produced by cells of the immune system and epithelial tissues, have a broad anti-viral activity that might play a role as protective mechanisms during HIV-1 exposure. A better understanding of the mechanisms and role of these soluble factors during the natural resistance to HIV-1 infection may have important implications for the design of novel therapeutic strategies to combat the morbidity and mortality associated with the HIV-1 pandemic."
1941,0.005,1.0000,"Antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) of the IgA, IgG, and IgM isotypes and high levels of the HIV suppressive beta-chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation, normally T cell expressed and secreted) were found in the cervicovaginal secretions (CVSs) of 7.5% of 342 multiply and repeatedly exposed African HIV-seronegative female sex workers. The antibodies are part of a local compartmentalized secretory immune response to HIV, since they are present in vaginal fluids that are free of contaminating semen. Cervicovaginal antibodies showed a reproducible pattern of reactivity restricted to gp160 and p24. Locally produced anti-env antibodies exhibit reactivity toward the neutralizing ELDKWA epitope of gp41. Study results show that antibodies purified from CVSs block the transcytosis of cell-associated HIV through a tight epithelial monolayer in vitro. These findings suggest that genital resistance to HIV may involve HIV-specific cervicovaginal antibody responses in a minority of highly exposed HIV-seronegative women in association with other protecting factors, such as local production of HIV-suppressive chemokines."
9090,0.005,1.0000,"A synthetic peptide, RPI 312, that specifically inhibits the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) showed a potent inhibition on virus production, maturation, and infectivity. Treatment with this agent prevented the cleavage of Gag protein at the site between p17 and p24 in HIV-1 chronically infected MOLT-4 cells as well as in the released virus. Passage of HIV-1 in the presence of gradually increasing concentrations of this protease inhibitor resulted in emergence of a variant that could evade the drug effects. In the resistant variant the maturation of Gag proteins appeared normal, but its infectivity was reduced compared with that of the parent virus. The nucleotides coding the amino acids at and around the cleavage site between Gag proteins p17 and p24 were not changed. One point mutation (A-->G) at site 2082 of the pol gene that resulted in one amino acid change at site 84 of the protease from isoleucine to valine (I-84-->V) could be detected in the resistant variant. An HIV-1 infectious DNA clone with the I-84-->V mutation also showed reduced sensitivity to this protease inhibitor. The findings that the resistant variant had lower infectivity and was still affected by higher doses of the drug support the speculation that resistance to protease inhibitors may not be as problematic as other drug resistance."
8338,0.005,1.0000,"Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and abnormalities in fat redistribution, glucose homeostasis, and lipid metabolism are prevalent among HIV-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The relationship between the metabolic and skeletal complications of HIV is unclear. Fifty-one HIV patients on HAART (aged 30-54 yr, 86% male) and 21 HIV-negative control subjects (aged 31-51 yr, 82% male) were examined with oral glucose tolerance testing, a fasting lipid profile, and dual x-ray absorptiometry, and markers of bone formation (serum osteocalcin) and resorption (urinary deoxypyridinoline). HIV-infected subjects had a higher prevalence of either osteopenia or osteoporosis (World Health Organization criteria) at the spine, hip, or forearm, compared with HIV-negative controls (63% vs. 32%, P = 0.02) and evidence of increased bone resorption (urine deoxypyridinoline, 14.7 +/- 6.5 vs. 10.9 +/- 2.5 nmol/mmol creatinine, P = 0.012). Among the HIV-infected patients, those with reduced bone mineral density (n = 32) were similar to the group with normal BMD (n = 19) in the use of protease inhibitors, duration of HAART therapy, or other demographic variables. Plasma glucose 2 h after a glucose load (odds ratio 1.02 per 1 mg/dl increase, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.05, P = 0.009) and central adiposity (trunk fat/total fat) (odds ratio 1.09 per 1% ratio increase, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.18, P = 0.012) were associated with reduced BMD. These associations remained significant in a multivariate model including age and body mass index. Bone resorption was associated with female gender (P < 0.001) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.034) in a multivariate linear regression model controlling for age, body mass index, protease inhibitor use, duration of HAART, and extremity fat. Reduced BMD is prevalent in HIV-infected patients on HAART and is related to central adiposity and postload hyperglycemia. Bone resorption is independently associated with female gender and dyslipidemia. HIV-infected patients with metabolic abnormalities may represent a population that would benefit from bone density screening."
2633,0.005,1.0000,"Sequential paired samples of blood and seminal fluid were obtained from a cohort of 54 HIV-1-infected homosexual males. The prevalence of GBV-C/HGV RNA in the cell-free fractions of some of these patients was determined using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). To assess the effects of HIV-1 and HCV infection upon GBV-C/HGV RNA status, blood CD4 cell counts, HCV RNA status, and HIV-1 proviral DNA and viral RNA titres were also determined. GBV-C/HGV RNA was detected in 8/30 (27%) of the blood plasma samples obtained at the start of the study, and was present at a frequency of 14/64 (22%) in all the blood plasma samples tested. By contrast, GBV-C/HGV RNA was not detected in the 26 seminal fluid samples obtained at the start of the study, including 8 samples obtained from patients for which GBV-C/HGV RNA was detected in the corresponding blood sample. Of the samples tested for the presence of both GBV-C/HGV and HCV RNA, there was no evidence of coinfection. Although GBV-C/HGV RNA detection rates were significantly higher in individuals with blood CD4 cell counts greater than 200 cells per microlitre, there were no significant differences in the median blood CD4 cell counts or HIV-1 proviral DNA or viral RNA titres observed between the GBV-C/HGV-positive and -negative individuals. The failure to detect GBV-C/HGV RNA in seminal fluid samples obtained from this cohort would suggest that further studies need to be carried out to determine the roles of sexual transmission and of seminal fluid in GBV-C/HGV infection."
6659,0.005,1.0000,"Thirty-six sexually active couples serologically discordant for human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), within the Baltimore Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) were assessed to determine whether evidence of HIV-1 infection could be detected in the HIV-1-antibody-negative partners and whether factors associated with lack of transmission of HIV from the seropositive to the seronegative partner could be ascertained. Six HIV-1 seropositive couples and 18 seronegative couples were followed concurrently for comparison. None of the seropositive subjects had an AIDS-defining illness at entry into the study, and all subjects were followed for 1 year. A separate evaluation of unprotected anal receptive and insertive intercourse between discordant couples indicated high-risk activities for a median of 40 months, as reported by the HIV seropositive partner. Despite this finding, none of the HIV-1 seronegative men in discordant couples had evidence of HIV-1 infection by viral culture, p24 antigen testing, or polymerase chain reaction for HIV-1 DNA. Discordant seronegatives and seropositives did not differ from concordant seronegatives and seropositives in numbers of circulating CD4, CD8, and natural killer lymphocytes or in prevalence of antibodies to herpes simplex virus, type 1, Epstein-Barr virus, or cytomegalovirus, except that discordant seronegative men were less likely than their seropositive partners to have antibodies to herpes simplex virus, type 2. The reason for the apparent lack of HIV-1 infection in seronegative discordant individuals remains unexplained and did not appear to be associated with type of sexual activity, T-lymphocyte subsets or natural killer cells, or early stage of HIV-1 disease."
5652,0.005,1.0000,"LAV/HTLV-III has been closely linked to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We have studied and correlated the prevalence of AIDS-associated retrovirus and retroviral antibodies in several groups of male homosexuals from Greenwich Village. Retrovirus was detected in cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes by testing for reverse transcriptase (RT) and confirmed by establishment of virus-producer cell lines, and electron microscopy. Seventy-six percent of patients with AIDS, 93% with AIDS-related complex (ARC), 69% with generalized lymphadenopathy (LAS), and 35% of asymptomatic homosexuals were positive for virus in the RT assay. Transmission of the virus from RT-positive lymphocytes into the CEM cell line was successful in 10 of 11 randomly chosen cases. No virus isolates were obtained from lymphocytes of 8 heterosexual individuals. Serum antibodies against AIDS-associated virus were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay and confirmed by Western blotting, using an LAV/HTLV-III-producer cell line, LAV-N1, which we established. LAV/N1 virus was purified by ultracentrifugation through sucrose gradient and the pattern of its proteins was determined by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using sera from an AIDS patient. The major polypeptides of LAV/HTLV-III (19, 25-27, 32, 42 and 54 kilodalton) were present. These proteins did not react in Western blots with sera positive for Adult T cell leukemia virus (ATLV). thus, LAV-N1 and ATLV were not antigenically related. In our assay for LAV/HTLV-III antibodies, 18 (100%) of patients with AIDS, 13 (100%) of patients with ARC, 24 (69%) of 35 patients with LAS and 9 (39%) of 23 asymptomatic homosexuals were sero-positive. Heterosexual controls were negative. All IF-positive sera tested by Western blot contained antibodies against specific viral proteins. High titers (greater than or equal to 1:1280) of serum antibodies against LAV/HTLV-III virus were detected in 71% of AIDS patients, 62% with ARC, 38% LAS and 13% among asymptomatic homosexuals. Our data show that the presence of LAV/HTLV-III antibodies correlates with the presence of infectious virus. Antibody titers may also correlate with progression toward AIDS."
4240,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral treatment is compromised by viral resistance mutations. Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is therefore monitored closely, but follow-up studies of these patients are limited. Virus from 1405 individuals diagnosed with HIV-1 in Denmark between 2001 and 2009 was analyzed for TDR, and molecular-epidemiological links and progression of the infection were described based on data from standardized questionnaires, the prospective Danish HIV Cohort Study, and by phylogenetic analysis. Eighty-five individuals were found to be infected with virus harboring mutations resulting in a prevalence of 6.1%, with no changes over time. The main resistance mutations were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation 215 revertants, as well as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation 103N/S and protease inhibitor (PI) mutations 90M and 85V. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed 12 transmission chains involving 37 TDR individuals. Of these 21 were also documented epidemiologically. The virus included in the transmission chain carried similar resistance mutations to the TDR index case, whereas controls chains from index cases without TDR were generally without resistance mutations. We observed no difference in progression of the infection between individuals infected with TDR and individuals infected with wild-type HIV-1. The prevalence of TDR is low in Denmark and transmission of dual-drug-resistant HIV-1 is infrequent. The TDR isolates were shown to originate from local patients failing therapy."
4407,0.005,1.0000,"To study the pattern of transmission of HBV in a large urban community, an in-depth prospective study was performed in Hamburg between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002. In total, 524 patients were classified as hepatitis B cases according to the case definition of the Robert Koch Institute, comprising 197 foreign-born and 327 German-born persons. The principal risk factor was parenteral drug use, with 17.7% (n=93/524) of all documented cases of hepatitis B, followed by immigration as refugees (13.9%; n=73). Of all 524 cases, 72 (13.7%) were associated with heterosexual (n=41) or homosexual (n=31) transmission. Household contacts of HBV carriers or of patients with acute infectious disease contributed to 9.0% of the cases (n=47). Medical procedures were most probably the source in 7.4% (n=39), although only 3.2% (n=17) of all patients were health-care workers. In multivariate analysis of household contacts, male-male sexual activity was found to be the greatest risk factor for acquiring an acute HBV infection, followed by asylum-seeking status and the number of contacts. The incidence was 3.5-fold higher among foreign-born persons (16.1 per 100,000) than among German-born individuals (4.5 per 100,000) suggesting that a targeted intervention in this population group is a public-health need. The current national policy of vaccination in defined age groups should be extended to the immunization of all children of foreign-born parents as well as the screening and immunisation of susceptible foreign-born adults."
4489,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with a high incidence of lymphoma. Typically, the lymphomas are B-cell in origin, and although they occur in the setting of HIV-1 infection, historical studies have found no evidence for the presence of HIV-1 within the transformed B-cells. We describe a new class of large cell lymphoma wherein HIV p24 expression within the tumor specimens was found to be extremely high. In the first case, HIV was expressed in the tumor-associated transformed T-cells. In three other cases, HIV was found to be highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages. These tumors exhibited a mixed immunophenotype histologically. Analysis by inverse polymerase chain reaction, using HIV long terminal repeat primers, demonstrated monoclonal HIV integration sites for all four tumors. Direct sequencing of the T-cell lymphoma inverse polymerase chain reaction products identified the HIV integration site within the fur gene, just upstream from the c-fes/fps protooncogene. Using segments of the fur gene as a probe, the other three monoclonal integration sites mapped to the same region. Although the integration and up-regulation of c-fes/fps was localized to the tumor cells within the T-cell lymphoma, the cells containing the monoclonal HIV in the other mixed immunophenotype lymphomas are currently unknown. These observations suggest that HIV may contribute directly to lymphomagenesis and identify a common site of HIV integration within a subset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome lymphoma."
7617,0.005,1.0000,"Repeated bottleneck passages result in fitness losses of RNA viruses. In the case of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), decreases in fitness after a limited number of plaque-to-plaque transfers in MT-4 cells were very drastic. Here we report an analysis of entire genomic nucleotide sequences of four HIV-1 clones derived from the same HIV-1 isolate and their low-fitness progeny following 7 to 15 plaque-to-plaque passages. Clones accumulated 4 to 28 mutations per genome, with dominance of A --> G and G --> A transitions (57% of all mutations) and 49% nonsynonymous replacements. One clone-but not three sibling clones-showed an overabundance of G --> A transitions, evidencing the highly stochastic nature of some types of mutational bias. The distribution of mutations along the genome was very unusual in that mutation frequencies in gag were threefold higher than in env. Particularly striking was the complete absence of replacements in the V3 loop of gp120, confirmed with partial nucleotide sequences of additional HIV-1 clones subjected to repeated bottleneck passages. The analyses revealed several amino acid replacements that have not been previously recorded among natural HIV-1 isolates and illustrate how evolution of an RNA virus genome, with regard to constant and variable regions, can be profoundly modified by alterations in population dynamics."
3773,0.005,1.0000,"A 49 year-old man was referred to our hospital for fear of developing fulminant hepatic failure. There had been an outbreak of fulminant hepatitis B in a dialysis clinic in the western part of Honshu, Japan, that resulted in four deaths among six patients. After the sixth patient contracted severe hepatitis, all patients in the unit were screened biweekly for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to detect newly infected patients as soon as possible. Our patient was the seventh victim, and on the day he gave a positive result for HBsAg, his hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level had reached 1.1 x 10(11) copies/ml as assessed by real time polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of the causal HBV revealed the presence of a mutation in the precore region (nt 1896), two mutations in the core promoter (nt 1762 and nt 1764), and some minor mutations in the P gene that were restricted to the upstream region. These mutations are indicative of a virus with a high replicative rate that cannot secrete HBeAg. Taken together, these findings indicate that it is very likely that the replicative ability of the causal virus was as vigorous as that of HBV in hepatitis B e antigen-positive asymptomatic carriers with markedly high viral titers. The present case report provides clinical evidence of a possible association between the rapid spread of highly replicative HBV before host immunological recognition and the development of fulminant hepatitis."
9564,0.005,1.0000,"Clinicians in Madrid have been observing and treating HIV-positive patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) for over a decade. As their records cover some of the co-infection cases that occurred before and after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced into Spain, retrospective analysis of the records has allowed some of the effects of HAART on local VL to be determined. Encouragingly, HAART appears to have decreased the annual incidence of VL among local AIDS cases, from 4.81 cases/100 to just 0.8 case/100 (P <0.0005), a first episode of VL now appearing only when there is obvious HAART failure. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be very good at preventing VL relapses; within 24 months of antileishmanial treatment, 70% of patients who were receiving HAART had such relapses. The mean time between antileishmanial treatment and VL relapse was, however, longer when HAART was used than when it was not (20 v. 13 months). In those receiving HAART, relapses of the VL often occurred despite increasing CD4+ cell counts and undetectable HIV loads, indicating that successful treatment of the viral infection is insufficient to prevent the relapse of the leishmaniasis. These results are in general agreement with other observations made in Spain. VL relapses are possible and even frequent in HIV-positives who have no more than 200 CD4+ cells/microl, but secondary prophylaxis to prevent VL relapses may be safely suspended if a CD4+ count of >200 cells/microl can be maintained using HAART. VL also seems to hamper the immunological recovery of the HIV-positive, although HAART appears to have little effect on the clinical manifestations of VL."

A total of 794 patient isolates obtained from four sites in Lima, Peru, underwent spoligotyping and drug resistance testing. In one of these sites, the HIV unit of Hospital Dos de Mayo (HDM), an isolation ward for HIV/TB coinfected patients opened during the study as an infection control intervention: circulating genotypes and drug resistance pre- and postintervention were compared. All other sites cared for HIV-negative outpatients: genotypes and drug resistance rates from these sites were compared with those from HDM. HDM patients showed high concordance between multidrug resistance, PZA resistance according to the Wayne method, the two most common genotypes (spoligotype international type [SIT] 42 of the Latino American-Mediterranean (LAM)-9 clade and SIT 53 of the T1 clade), and the two most common pncA mutations (G145A and A403C). These associations were absent among community isolates. The infection control intervention was associated with 58-92% reductions in TB caused by SIT 42 or SIT 53 genotypes (odds ratio [OR] = 0.420, P = 0.003); multidrug-resistant TB (OR = 0.349, P < 0.001); and PZA-resistant TB (OR = 0.076, P < 0.001). In conclusion, pncA mutation typing, with resistance testing and spoligotyping, was useful in identifying a nosocomial TB outbreak and demonstrating its resolution after implementation of infection control measures."
1336,0.005,1.0000,"Combination therapy can successfully suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in patients but selects for drug resistance, requiring subsequent resistance-guided therapeutic changes. This report describes the development and validation of a novel assay that offers a uniform method to measure susceptibility to all clinically approved HIV type 1 (HIV-1) drugs targeting reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR), integrase (IN), and viral entry. It is an assay in which the antiviral effect on infection within a single replication cycle is measured in triply transfected U87.CD4.CXCR4.CCR5 cells, based on homologous recombination between patient-derived amplicons and molecular proviral clones tagged with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene and from which certain viral genomic regions are removed. The deletions stretch from p17 codon 7 to PR codon 98 in pNL4.3-DeltagagPR-EGFP, from PR codons 1 to 99 in pNL4.3-DeltaPR-EGFP, from RT codons 1 to 560 in pNL4.3-DeltaRT-EGFP, from IN codons 1 to 288 in pNL4.3-DeltaIN-EGFP, and from gp120 codon 34 to gp41 codon 237 in pNL4.3-Deltaenv-EGFP. The optimized experimental conditions enable the investigation of patient samples regardless of viral subtype or coreceptor use. The extraction and amplification success rate for a set of clinical samples belonging to a broad range of HIV-1 group M genetic forms (A-J, CRF01-03, CRF05, and CRF12-13) and displaying a viral load range of 200 to >500,000 RNA copies/ml was 97%. The drug susceptibility measurements, based on discrimination between infected and noninfected cells on a single-cell level by flow cytometry, were reproducible, with coefficients of variation for resistance ranging from 7% to 31%, and were consistent with scientific literature in terms of magnitude and specificity."
1159,0.005,1.0000,"Rapid detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can result in improved patient care and/or faster implementation of public health preventive measures. A new rapid test, Determine (Abbott, Abbott Park, Ill.), detects HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 antibodies within 15 min by using 50 microl of serum or plasma. No specialized equipment or ancillary supplies are required, and results are read visually. A positive result is noted by the appearance of a red line. An operational control (red line) indicates proper test performance. We evaluated the Determine rapid HIV detection test with a group of well-characterized serum samples (CD4 counts and viral loads were known) and serum samples from HIV-positive individuals at field sites in Honduras and the Dominican Republic. In the field evaluations, the results obtained by the Determine assay were compared to those obtained by local in-country HIV screening procedures. We evaluated serum from 100 HIV-positive patients and 66 HIV-negative patients. All samples gave the expected results. In a companion study, 42 HIV-positive samples from a Miami, Fla., serum bank were tested by the Determine assay. The samples had been characterized in terms of CD4 counts and viral loads. Fifteen patients had CD4 counts <200 cells/mm(3), while 27 patients had CD4 counts >200 cells/mm(3). Viral loads ranged from 630 to 873,746 log(10) copies/ml. All samples from the Miami serum bank were positive by the Determine test. Combined results from the multicenter studies indicated that the correct results were obtained by the Determine assay for 100% (142 of 142) of the HIV-positive serum samples and 100% (66 of 66) of the HIV-negative serum samples. The Determine test was simple to perform and the results were easy to interpret. The Determine test provides a valuable new method for the rapid identification of HIV-positive individuals, especially in developing countries with limited laboratory infrastructures."
11,0.005,1.0000,"This study investigated the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on genital human papillomavirus (HPV) in heterosexual couples. More HIV-positive men and women had genital HPV compared with HIV-negative men (77 vs 49%; P<0.001) and women (74 vs 36%; P<0.001). More men and women with partners who were HPV positive had HPV genital infection compared with those with HPV-negative partners (for men, 72% compared with 40%; P<0.001). Men with HIV-positive female partners were at greater risk of high-risk HPV and low-risk HPV (LR HPV) infection compared with men with HIV-negative female partners. This risk increased with decreasing CD4 count { ≥ 350 ml⁻¹: odds ratio [OR ], 2.37 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-3.83]; < 350 ml⁻¹: OR, 3.02 [95 % CI, 1.86-4.9]}. Conversely, the risk of HPV of any type was not found to differ between women with an HIV-positive or HIV-negative male partner. In men, HIV infection and female partner HIV-positive status were both associated with a higher risk of type-specific HPV concordance with their sexual partner, though the associations were not significant for LR HPV. In women, HIV infection and low CD4 count were significantly associated with increased risk of type-specific HPV concordance, but male partner HIV-positive status was not significantly associated with this concordance. In conclusion, male genital HPV prevalence and type-specific sharing were influenced by their own HIV-positive status and that of their female partner. In contrast, female genital HPV prevalence and HPV type-specific sharing were determined by their own HIV-positive status and not by that of their male partner."
3976,0.005,1.0000,"This study aimed to examine the baseline prevalence of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive men who have sex with men in Taiwan and to determine the association of age and CD4+ T cell counts with HPV infection. In 2010, 305 men who have sex with men infected with HIV and 100 HIV-seronegative men who have sex with men were recruited. Genital swabs were collected and 37 HPV genotypes were detected using linear array HPV genotyping. HPV infection was present in 45.3% of the patients infected with HIV and in 18% of the HIV-negative subjects (P < 0.001). HPV types 52, 51, and 16 were the most commonly identified oncogenic types. Oncogenic HPV types were identified in 31.2% of the patients infected with HIV and in 13% of the seronegative subjects (P < 0.001). Adjusted odd ratios (ORs) for the detection of any HPV type were 2.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.9) for men who have sex with men aged 30-34 and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-4.3) for those aged >35 compared with that for those aged <25. ORs were 2.8 (95% CI, 1.0-7.4) for a CD4+ T cell count of 200-350 cells/µl and 8.5 (95% CI, 2.9-24.5) for a CD4+ T cell count of <200 cells/µl compared with that for seronegative subjects. In conclusion, this novel HPV study, carried out in Northern Taiwan on men who have sex with men, revealed that age and immune state were associated significantly and independently with HPV infection."
4443,0.005,1.0000,"The relationship between CCR5 and CCR2b genotypes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 disease progression was studied among the 108 seroconverters of the Amsterdam cohort of injecting drug users (IDUs). In contrast to earlier studies among homosexual men, no effect on disease progression of the CCR5 Delta32/+ and the CCR2b 64I/+ genotypes was found, when progression to AIDS, death, or a CD4 cell count <200/microL was compared by a Cox proportional hazards model. Furthermore, CD4 cell decline (by a regression model for repeated measurements) and virus load in the first 3 years after seroconversion did not differ between the CCR5 and CCR2b wild type and heterozygous genotypes. A nested matched case-control study also revealed no significant effect of the CCR5 and CCR2b mutations. Immunologic differences between IDUs and homosexual men may account for the observed lack of effect. Alternatively, difference in transmission route or characteristics of the HIV-1 variants that circulate in IDUs could also explain this phenomenon."
3875,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-resistant commercial sex workers provide a unique opportunity to study correlates of protection associated with natural resistance to HIV infection. Emerging data from studies of these individuals and other uninfected individuals who have been exposed to HIV suggest that low levels of immune activation may contribute to protection against infection. In the present study, HIV-resistant individuals were shown to have reduced frequencies of T cells expressing the activation marker CD69. They were also found to have elevated frequencies of regulatory T (T(reg)) cells, compared with HIV-negative control individuals. By controlling levels of T cell activation, T(reg) cells may contribute to HIV resistance by minimizing the pool of cells susceptible to infection."
1622,0.005,1.0000,"In sub-Saharan Africa, the Pacific, and particularly Asia, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly endemic, the most common route of transmission is perinatal. To minimize the number of horizontal transmissions, we determined the prevalence of HBV genotypes among children in northern Thailand. From a survey of 1,231 schoolchildren in Chiang Mai during 1998 to 2000, 55 (4.5%) were found positive for HBsAg. Fifty-three HBsAg-positive samples were available for this study. These came from 28 girls (52.8%) and 25 boys (47.2%), age 5-16 years, with a mean age of 12.8 (+/-2.6) years. The laboratory method was based on a multiplex-PCR for the detection of 6 HBV genotypes (A-F). Among 53 HBsAg positive cases, 48 (90.6%) were genotype C, followed by 4 cases of genotype B (7.5%), and 1 case (1.9%) with mixed infection with genotypes B and C. The high prevalence of HBV genotype C follow by genotype B is similar to that found among blood donors in northern Thailand and the nationwide epidemiological survey conducted in 2004. Perinatal transmission may play an important role in the spread of the virus in this area, as in other Asian countries, where genotypes C and B are highly prevalent."
7948,0.005,1.0000,"We examined the emergence of CXCR4 (i.e., X4) tropism in 67 male human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seroconverters from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) who were selected to reflect the full spectrum of rates of HIV-1 disease progression. A mean of 10 serial samples per donor were evaluated by a laboratory-validated, commercially available assay to determine phenotypic coreceptor use. A total of 52% of men had dual- or mixed-tropic HIV-1 detected at 1 or more of the time points tested. Use of X4 by HIV-1 was detected more frequently among men who developed AIDS (defined as a CD4(+) T cell count of <200 cells/muL and/or an AIDS-defining illness) < or =11 years after seroconversion than among those who did not (P = .005), as well as among men who exhibited a total T cell count decline (i.e., a CD3(+) inflection point), compared with those who did not (P = .03). For men in whom both X4 virus and an inflection point were detected, emergence of X4 virus preceded the inflection point by a median of 0.83 years. The median CD4(+) T cell count at first detection of X4 viruses before the onset of AIDS was 475 cells/microL. We conclude that HIV-1 variants that used X4 frequently emerged at high CD4(+) T cell counts and may contribute to the decrease in T cell numbers during late HIV-1 infection."
2046,0.005,1.0000,"CD8+ lymphocyte phenotypes were characterized during acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and a comparison was made to previous studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This was of interest because CD8+ cells contribute to immunologic control of both infections, but the usual outcome of EBV infection is benign, whereas untreated HIV infection is fatal. During acute EBV infection, CD8+ cells expressed elevated levels of the activation antigens CD38 and HLA-DR, similar to that during chronic HIV infection. Within 16 weeks, when EBV latency is established, CD8+ cell activation had resolved. In contrast, activation persists in HIV infection. Expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD8+ cells could be a marker for ongoing viral replication in both infections. Other CD8+ cell alterations observed in this study of acute EBV infection included increases in both CD62L- and CD62L+ CD8+ cells and unique kinetics in the expansion of the CD57+CD8+ cell subset."
7716,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-infected patients are at increased risk for persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the major cause of anogenital cancer. The present study describes the HPV prevalence in urine samples of 243 HIV-infected men and a control group of 231 men. HPV DNA was amplified by the SPF10 polymerase chain reaction primer set. The overall HPV prevalence in HIV-infected men was 27.5% compared with 12.6% in controls (P < 0.01). Infections with high-risk and multiple HPV genotypes were present in both groups. Differences were not statistically significant. A multivariate logistic regression model showed a decreased HPV prevalence associated with use of a nucleoside and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor combination (P = 0.03). A trend was observed towards a higher HPV prevalence and a lower CD4 cell count. Further prospective studies are needed to determine the role of HPV DNA testing in urine in future screening programmes for anal cancer in men."
7302,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence and associated factors of erectile dysfunction (ED) in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected men remain controversial. The authors evaluated ED, clinical, and emotional variables in a group of 501 HIV-infected men in a cross-sectional 4-month observational study. ED was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function-5 and emotional status using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire. Median age (interquartile range) was 42 (35, 48) years. Time since HIV diagnosis was 6.3 (2.6, 17.1) years, 92% were taking antiretroviral treatment and 81.8% had an HIV-RNA viral load <50 copies. The prevalence of ED was 58.5%. ED was mild in 30.1%, mild to moderate in 19.5%, moderate in 6.1%, and severe in 2.5%. ED medications were used by 19% of men. In the univariate analysis, the variables associated with all degrees of ED were older age, longer time since HIV diagnosis, higher scores in HAD, not taking efavirenz, taking etravirine, taking ritonavir, HIV/Hepatitis C Virus coinfection, and taking a protease inhibitor-containing regimen. For mild to moderate, moderate, and severe ED, the same variables were significant, as were lower nadir CD4 cell count, lower social support, taking atazanavir, concomitant conditions, and concomitant treatments. The variables that remained significant in the multivariate analyses, considering all degrees of ED or excluding mild ED were the following: older age and higher scores in HAD total. In summary, ED affected more than half of this cohort of well controlled HIV-infected men. Age and emotional status seemed to play a fundamental role in its presence."
7836,0.005,1.0000,"Long-term non-progressors (LTNP) represent a minority (1-5%) of HIV-infected individuals characterized by documented infection for more than 7-10 years, a stable CD4+ T cell count over 500/mm(3) and low viremia in the absence of antiretroviral treatment. Protective factors described so far such as the CCR5delta32 deletion, protective HLA alleles, or defective viruses fail to fully explain the partial protection phenotype. The existence of additional host resistance mechanisms in LTNP patients was investigated here using a whole human genome microarray study comparing gene expression profiles of unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from LTNP patients, HIV-1 infected patients under antiretroviral therapy with CD4+ T cell levels above 500/mm(3) (ST), as well as healthy individuals. Genes that were up- or downregulated exclusively in LTNP, ST or in both groups in comparison to controls were identified and classified in functional categories using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. ST and LTNP patient groups revealed distinct genetic profiles, regarding gene number in each category and up- or downregulation of specific genes, which could have a bearing on the outcome of each group. We selected some relevant genes to validate the differential expression using quantitative real-time qRT-PCR. Among others, we found several genes related to the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Our results identify new possible host genes and molecules that could be involved in the mechanisms leading to the slower progression to AIDS and sustained CD4+ T cell counts that is peculiar to LTNP patients.

5459,0.005,1.0000,"In order to determine the prevalence of HIV infection in french patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis therapy, questionnaire forms were mailed out in february 1997 to the heads of the 260 dialysis facilities. We documented number of patients on maintenance dialysis therapy (hemo and peritoneal dialysis) and for HIV infected dialysis patients: age, gender, cause and duration of ESRD, known duration of HIV infection, risk factors for HIV infection, HBV and/or HCV infection, presence of clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), total CD4 count and treatment with antiretroviral agents. Questionnaire forms were returned from 98% of the dialysis facilities. As of february 1997 some 22,707 patients with ESRD were treated by renal replacement therapy, 19,947 by hemodialysis (HD) and 2760 by peritoneal dialysis (PD). 82 patients with ESRD and HIV infection were reported corresponding to 0.36% prevalence rate of all patients undergoing dialysis at the time specified. The 82 study subjects with ESRD and HIV infection received hemodialysis (79 patients) or peritoneal dialysis (3 patients) in 42 facilities. Forty seven patients were treated in Paris and suburbs and 9 in our own center. All 82 patients comprised 63% men and 47% women which included patients coming from Africa (37%), Caribbean and Oceania (28%), Europe (35%) of a mean age of 41.8 years. Modes of transmission were homobisexuals 15%, heterosexuals 31%, intravenous drug abusers 17%, blood transfusion 17% and unknown 20%. The mean duration of HIV infection was 96 months (range 12-168 months) and the mean duration of ESRD was 58 months (range 1-235 months). HIV associated nephropathy was established in 31%. AIDS was diagnosed in 25 patients. Seventy one percent of the patients were receiving an antiretroviral drug (tritherapy in 25% of cases). In conclusion HIV prevalence rate among French dialysis patients is low and focused in Paris and oversea. Sexual transmission is the most important HIV contamination but blood transfusion transmission remains greater than in general HIV population. Survival has improved compared with the survival rate reported in the 1980s."

4934,0.005,1.0000,"Recognition and diagnosis of acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the primary care setting presents an opportunity for patient education and health promotion. Symptoms of acute HIV infection are nonspecific (e.g., fever, malaise, myalgias, rash), making misdiagnosis common. Because a wide range of conditions may produce similar symptoms, the diagnosis of acute HIV infection involves a high index of suspicion, a thorough assessment of HIV exposure risk, and appropriate HIV-related laboratory tests. HIV RNA viral load testing is the most useful diagnostic test for acute HIV infection because HIV antibody testing results are generally negative or indeterminate during acute HIV infection. After the diagnosis of acute HIV infection is confirmed, physicians should discuss effective transmission risk reduction strategies with patients. The decision to initiate antiretroviral therapy should be guided by consultation with an HIV specialist."
3388,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at high risk for gastrointestinal infections causing diarrhea, particularly when those infections are parasitic in nature. This propensity is more pronounced in AIDS, where opportunistic parasitic infections may cause severe diarrhea, marked absorptive dysfunction, and significant risk of mortality. There are scant data regarding parasitic infections among HIV patients in the developed world; most studies and research come from povertystricken areas of South Africa, India, Iran, and the South Pacific. Although multiple infections with the same or different parasites have been reported, simultaneous infections are rare. We present the case of a 35-year-old man who developed a co-infection with Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides, simultaneously, the diagnosis being made after the judicious evaluation of a stool sample. Given the associated morbidity, prompt diagnosis and treatment are needed to avoid further complications in patients with HIV. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of triple parasitic infection in a patient with HIV. "
6096,0.005,1.0000,"Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an important adverse event among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The epidemiology of IRIS in Thailand has not been well examined, especially among adult HIV-infected patients. In the present study, we reviewed the medical records of 174 HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naive patients older than 15 years (the median CD4 count at commencement of HAART was 37 cells/mm3) and compared characteristics of patients with and without IRIS. During a 12-month follow-up period after commencement of HAART, 11 cases (6.3%) of IRIS were identified (4.2/100 patient-years HAART). The cases included nine cases with mycobacterial infection, one with cytomegalovirus retinitis and one with cryptococcal meningitis. The patients with IRIS were significantly younger than those without IRIS (29 vs 36 on medians, p = 0.022). The median interval between commencement of HAART and the onset of IRIS was 22 days. Although all patients with IRIS improved with or without corticosteroids, they were more frequently hospitalized during a 12-month follow-up period while taking HAART (1 vs 0 on medians, p < 0.001). The incidence of IRIS in advanced adult HIV-infected patients in Thailand was lower than that reported from Europe and the United States, which may be attributable to deferment of HAART after diagnosing opportunistic infections."
7099,0.005,1.0000,"Although in Western Europe and North America the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has declined in patients awaiting renal transplantation, it remains a relevant clinical problem, mainly in patients with a long history of renal replacement therapy (RRT) who may have been infected many years ago. At the same time, a significant proportion of renal transplant recipients (RTR) is at risk for HBV infection in areas with endemic HBV. HBV infection may increase morbidity and mortality in RTR. The majority of long-term studies reported reduced patient survival compared with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative RTR. The risk for morbidity and mortality of HBsAg-positive RTR transplantation is probably related to the extent of pretransplant liver disease. A thorough evaluation, including liver biopsy in many patients, is required to assess the individual HBsAg-positive patient's risk-benefit ratio. The influence of immunosuppressive therapy on HBV replication and HBV-associated complications is not well established and for clinical practice individually tailored immunosuppression is recommended in HBsAg-positive RTR. Careful screening for HBV reactivation in HBsAg-positive RTR and a regular clinical follow-up after renal transplantation (RTX) including liver sonography is required for early detection of HBV-associated complications. With the availability of new antiviral drugs, new options for pre- and posttransplant therapy might improve the prognosis of RTR with chronic HBV infection."
8699,0.005,1.0000,"Identification of recent infections (RI) may contribute to improve the quality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) surveillance, monitoring ongoing transmission and planning and evaluating prevention programs. Our study applied an algorithm combining clinical and serological information to identify RI in individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in Rome, during the years 1999-2008, in order to describe the trend and characteristics of recently infected individuals. RI were documented seroconverters, or people with an HIV avidity index (AI)<0.80. Individuals with advanced infection (CD4 count <200 cells/?L or AIDS-defining illness) or with AI ?0.80 were considered long-standing infections. Overall, we observed 2,563 new HIV diagnoses. The algorithm was applied in 2124/2563 (82.9%). Of these, 355 were RI (16.7%). RI was found independently associated with calendar year (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]= 1.06, 95% confidence intervals [CI]=[CI 1.02-1.11], for every year of increase), HIV-risk category (men having sex with men: aOR=1.44, [CI 1.04-1.98]; injecting drug users: aOR=1.58, [CI 1.03-2.42] vs. heterosexuals), country of origin (foreign-born: vs Italians: aOR=0.46, [CI 0.33-0.62]), and recruitment site (inpatient vs outpatient clinic: aOR=0.49, [CI 0.37-0.66]). By the application of our algorithm we could characterize the pattern of ongoing HIV transmission, identifying groups needing more urgent prevention programs."
2159,0.005,1.0000,"Our previous study demonstrated the anti-apoptosis function of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vpu gene product in normal CD4+ T lymphocytes. In this study, using sequences obtained from the HIV sequence database, we compared vpu sequences from 184 preparations of various subtypes of HIV-1 from diverse geographical regions. Our analysis revealed that CRF01_AE isolates had premature stop codon mutations at the vpu gene at a much higher rate (36%) than other subtypes (0-9%). The premature stop codon mutations in vpu existed mostly at two amino acid residues: the methionine initiation codon and the boundary between the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains. The mutations at the latter site were more often detected in CRF01_AE. The higher mutation rates at vpu in CRF01_AE were confirmed by sequence comparison of polymerase chain reaction products newly obtained directly from the DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but not from the RNA from the plasma, in CRF01_AE- and subtype B-infected individuals. This finding may indicate the possibility that the more abundant population of HIV-1 CRF01_AE is able to induce apoptosis in CD4+ T lymphocytes than the populations of other subtypes."
1387,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lymphocyte P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and genotype in vivo and the expression of lymphocyte receptors critical in the life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), i.e., CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4. Using flow cytometry to quantify each membrane receptor/transporter, we demonstrate a highly significant correlation between P-gp protein expression and the expression of CXCR4 (rho = 0.874; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, confocal microscopy showed colocalized expression of CXCR4 and P-gp in the lymphocyte membrane. This significant relationship was also apparent at the mRNA level by use of reverse transcription-PCR (rho = 0.61; P < 0.005) and was present in both phytohemagglutinin-stimulated and unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Genotypic analysis of the C3435T single-nucleotide polymorphism of P-gp confirmed significantly higher levels of P-gp in C (range, 2.45 to 11.00 relative fluorescence units [RFU])- than in T (range, 0.25 to 5.00 RFU)-homozygous individuals (P = 0.0088; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.7 to 6.3 RFU). An equivalent association between CXCR4 levels and C (range, 12.7 to 44.1 RFU) versus T (range, 3 to 18.9 RFU) genotype was also demonstrated (P = 0.0019; 95% CI, 5.4 to 23.7). Functionally, although these correlates had no impact on HIV-1 production from either X4- or R5-tropic virus, expression correlated significantly with the activity of the HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) saquinavir for both P-gp (rho = 0.75; P = 0.0019) and CXCR4 (rho = 0.71; P = 0.0041). This study defines an association between P-gp (expression and genotype) and CXCR4 that may have implications for the selection of viral tropism and the access of drugs to protease for specific tropic types. The interplay between these two proteins may also influence the viral genotypes which escape effective chemotherapy and which therefore have the opportunity to evolve resistance to PIs."
2577,0.005,1.0000,"As a result of the potent drug combinations of reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors currently available, it is now possible to achieve extreme reductions in the numbers of viral particles in the peripheral blood of HIV-positive patients undergoing treatment, to the point that they are undetectable. Moreover, the immunological recovery resulting from continued and prolonged use of these drugs significantly reduces both mortality and the incidence of opportunistic infections. However, the strict therapeutic regimens required, the number of pills, adverse events and the stigma of a disease that requires the patient to introduce pill-taking into his/her lifestyle brings into question one aspect of mental health, which is motivation to do that which is being proposed. We investigated the influence of each of the components of the adherence trilogy: information, motivation and behavioral abilities, as risk factors in a population of HIV-positive/AIDS patients undergoing antiretroviral treatment in the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil."

However, this combination regimen can be associated with the occurrence of serious toxicities, which may reduce patient compliance. In particular, human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors and nevirapine among nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, have the potential for producing hepatotoxicity. We summarise current knowledge of the hepatotoxic effects associated with the commercially available human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors based on a literature review of the major retrospective and prospective clinical studies designed to elucidate risk factors for developing hepatotoxicity among human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy containing protease inhibitors. Coinfection with chronic hepatitis, a common occurrence in human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients, is identified as an independent risk factor for developing hepatotoxicity in antiretroviral-treated human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients treated with antiretroviral regimens containing protease inhibitors. The importance of other risk factors for developing protease inhibitor-associated hepatotoxicity and the mechanism underlying the drug-related hepatotoxicity are discussed. The data indicate that the potential for producing hepatotoxicity is variable among the protease inhibitors and suggest that based on differences in drug-related hepatotoxicity, certain protease inhibitors may be preferred for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus coinfected patients."
7533,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-positive individuals who use injection drugs (IDU) may have lower rates of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, previous studies of factors associated with adherence to ART among IDU have been limited primarily to samples drawn from clinical settings and in areas with financial barriers to healthcare.We evaluated patterns of ART adherence and rates of plasma HIV RNA response among a Canadian cohort of community-recruited IDU. Using data from a community-recruited cohort of antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected IDU, we investigated ART adherence patterns based on prescription refill compliance and factors associated with time to plasma HIV-1 RNA suppression (<500 copies/mL) using Cox proportional hazards regression in a setting with universal health care, including free ART. Between 1996 and 2008, 267 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected IDU initiated ART and had a median of 51 months (inter-quartile range: 17-95 months) of follow-up. Overall, 81 (30.3%) were ≥95% adherent during the first year of HAART and 187 (70.0%) achieved HIV RNA suppression at least once over the study period, for an incidence-density of 34.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.8-39.9) per 100 person-years. The Kaplan-Meier cumulative plasma HIV RNA suppression rates at 12 months after the initiation of ART were 80.8% (95% CI: 71.2-88.7) for adherent and 28.9% (95% CI: 22.8-36.1) for non-adherent participants. While several socio-demographic characteristics and drug-using behaviours were identified as barriers to successful treatment in unadjusted analyses, the factor most strongly associated with time to HIV RNA suppression in multivariate analysis was adherence to ART of at least 95% (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 6.0, 95% CI: 4.2-8.6, p<0.001). These results demonstrate low rates of adherence to ART among a community-recruited cohort of IDU and reinforce the importance of adherence as the key determinant of successful virological response to antiretroviral therapy."
5924,0.005,1.0000,"India is an endemic zone for hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is associated with both epidemic and sporadic infections. In West Bengal, only two hepatitis E outbreaks have been studied to date. However, sporadic cases of HEV infection also occur during inter-epidemic periods. The aim of this hospital-based study was to detect the prevalence of HEV infection in patients with acute sporadic hepatitis in West Bengal, India. Blood samples and clinical information were collected from 285 patients of both sexes and different ages with acute viral hepatitis (AVH) at Calcutta Medical College, Kolkata, a tertiary-care centre. Samples were tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies, anti-hepatitis A virus IgM and anti-HEV antibodies (IgM and IgG) by ELISA. Only those patients with AVH who were in their first week of illness and negative for all hepatotropic viral antibodies were tested for HEV RNA by reverse transcriptase nested PCR. HEV was identified as the most common cause of AVH (41.8% of patients), followed by HBV (21.4%), hepatitis A virus (17.2%) and hepatitis C virus (4.6%). Co-infections with more than one virus were found in 22 patients, with HBV-HEV the most common co-infection (3.8%). Only 14.7% of patients had no viral marker. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented epidemiological study of acute sporadic hepatitis with HEV in the state of West Bengal, India, indicating that this state is an endemic zone for HEV infection."
7861,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of hepatitis C antibodies (anti-HCV) was investigated in 1,378 central Brazilian children, students, and street youths (homeless adolescents without family links or adolescents working in poorly paid activities). Sera were tested with a second generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and positive samples were retested by a confirmatory assay (line immunoassay). All children attending day care centers were anti-HCV negative. Only one (0.2%) adolescent was positive in the student group. However, higher positivity was found in street youths; four (1.0%) living at home and three (3.0%) living in the streets and anti-HCV antibodies. Among these, the prevalence of anti-HCV increased significantly with age from 0% in the 9-12-year-old group to 6.9% in the 17-20-year-old group. Risk factors including blood transfusion, tattooing, intravenous drug use, and sexual intercourse with multiple partners were significantly associated with the presence of anti-HCV in street youths. These results indicate that apparently healthy children and adolescents attending day care centers or primary schools in central Brazil have a low exposure to HCV infection, but street youths in the same area are at risk for infection with this virus."
9798,0.005,1.0000,"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have, in addition to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs), gained a definitive place in the treatment of HIV-1 infections. Starting from the HEPT and TIBO derivatives, more than 30 structurally different classes of compounds have been identified as NNRTIs, that is compounds that are specifically inhibitory to HIV-1 replication and targeted at the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Two NNRTIs (nevirapine and delavirdine) have been formally licensed for clinical use and several others are in preclinical or clinical development [thiocarboxanilide UC-781, HEPT derivative MKC-442, quinoxaline HBY 097 and DMP 266 (efavirenz)]. The NNRTIs interact with a specific 'pocket' site of HIV-1 RT that is closely associated with, but distinct from, the NRTI binding site. NNRTIs are notorious for rapidly eliciting resistance due to mutations of the amino acids surrounding the NNRTI-binding site. However, the emergence of resistant HIV strains can be circumvented if the NNRTIs, alone or in combination, are used from the start at sufficiently high concentrations. In vitro, this procedure has proved to 'knock-out' virus replication and to prevent resistance from arising. In vivo, various triple-drug combinations of NNRTIs (nevirapine, delavirdine or efavirenz) with NRTIs (AZT, 3TC, ddI or d4T) and/or PIs (indinavir or nelfinavir) have been shown to afford a durable anti-HIV activity, as reflected by both a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and increased CD4 T-lymphocyte counts."
3763,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to assess the analytical and clinical relevance of minority variants using a new pyrosequencing (PSQ) assay and to detect minor variants with frequencies below the current 20% clinical setting limit. A PSQ approach for detecting and quantifying mutations was developed for the analysis of 14 codons of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) gene below the limit of conventional sequencing. Ten patients who experienced virological failure (VF) after a first-line regimen of lamivudine, tenofovir, and either efavirenz, nevirapine, or etravirine, as well as 10 controls patients without VF, were included in this retrospective study. Baseline plasma and plasma from the time of VF were assessed using Sanger sequencing and PSQ methods. The analytical sensitivity for the detection of minor sequence variants is 5%. At baseline, no minority variant was detected in 10/10 patient controls using both the Sanger sequencing and PSQ assays, whereas, two patients who failed therapy had baseline non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations that were not detected by the standard genotyping. At the time of VF, standard genotyping detected mutations in four out of the 10 VF patients, whereas, PSQ detected mutations in five out of the 10 VF patients. Clinically, minority mutations at a 10% level of detection can be assessed efficiently by pyrosequencing and used as a suitable predictor of the evolution of viral populations. These traits allow for a better interpretation of data analysis, which can help clinicians in providing a suitable treatment for HIV."
6416,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected CD8 lymphocytes have been reported in vivo, but the mechanism of infection remains unclear. Experiments using the thy/hu mouse model support export of intrathymically infected CD8 precursors, while recent in vitro data suggest that mature CD8 lymphocytes upregulate CD4 upon activation (generating a CD8bright CD4dim phenotype) and are susceptible to HIV infection. To determine whether these mechanisms operate in vivo and to assess their relative importance in the generation of circulating HIV-infected CD8 lymphocytes, we quantified HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) DNA in CD8+ CD4- and CD8bright CD4dim lymphocytes isolated from HIV-infected individuals by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. HIV infection of CD8 lymphocytes was demonstrated in 17 of 19 subjects, with a significant inverse relationship between level of infection and CD4 lymphocyte count (R = -0.73; P < 0.001). The level of HIV infection of CD8bright CD4dim lymphocytes was significantly higher (median, 1,730 HIV LTR copies/10(6) cells; n = 9) than that of CD8+ CD4- lymphocytes (undetectable in seven of nine individuals; P < 0.01) and approached that of CD4 lymphocytes from the same individuals (median, 3,660 HIV LTR copies/10(6) cells). CD8bright CD4dim lymphocytes represented 0.8 to 3.3% of total CD8 lymphocytes and were most prevalent in the memory subset. Thus, HIV-infected CD8 lymphocytes commonly circulate in HIV-infected individuals and are generated through infection of activated CD8 lymphocytes rather than through export of intrathymically infected precursors. The high level of infection of CD8bright CD4dim lymphocytes could have a direct role in the decline in CD8 lymphocyte function that accompanies HIV disease progression."
3555,0.005,1.0000,"Sooty mangabeys (SMs) naturally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) do not develop AIDS despite high levels of virus replication. At present, the mechanisms underlying this disease resistance are poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that SIV-infected SMs avoid immunodeficiency as a result of virus replication occurring in infected cells that live significantly longer than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected human cells. To this end, we treated six SIV-infected SMs with potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) and longitudinally measured the decline in plasma viremia. We applied the same mathematical models used in HIV-infected individuals and observed that SMs naturally infected with SIV also present a two-phase decay of viremia following ART, with the bulk (92 to 99%) of virus replication sustained by short-lived cells (average life span, 1.06 days), and only 1 to 8% occurring in longer-lived cells. In addition, we observed that ART had a limited impact on CD4(+) T cells and the prevailing level of T-cell activation and proliferation in SIV-infected SMs. Collectively, these results suggest that in SIV-infected SMs, similar to HIV type 1-infected humans, short-lived activated CD4(+) T cells, rather than macrophages, are the main source of virus production. These findings indicate that a short in vivo life span of infected cells is a common feature of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic primate lentivirus infections and support a model for AIDS pathogenesis whereby the direct killing of infected cells by HIV is not the main determinant of disease progression."
4831,0.005,1.0000,"To better understand whether potent antiretroviral therapies can modify the natural history of HIV-1-associated microsporidiosis and cryptosporidiosis, the response to antimicrobial treatment of these opportunistic infections was evaluated in patients with or without antiretroviral treatment. Fifty patients with diarrhoea, all positive for Cryptosporidium parvum or Enterocytozoon bieneusi, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected concerning demographics, clinical and microbiological characteristics of the parasitic infection, antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Faecal samples were prepared using the Richie formalin-ethyl acetate method and stained using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for detection of Cryptosporidium parvum and Isospora belli, the modified trichrome and calcofluor white technique for detection of Enterocytozoon spp., and iodine for detection of ova, cysts or vegetative forms. Diarrhoea was defined as an abnormal increase in stool liquidity, an abnormal increase in stool frequency and a daily stool weight of more than 250 g for a period of at least 4 days. Patients treated with double antiretroviral therapy or protease inhibitors demonstrated an excellent response and a sustained therapeutic effect after follow-up (range, 5-36 months). The relapse of cryptosporidiosis in two patients who discontinued antiretroviral therapy suggests that the infection might remain in a latent stage. The resolution of the diarrhoea seems to be related to an increased CD4+ cell count rather than to the viral load. In conclusion, these data strongly support the hypothesis that combination antiretroviral therapy is able to greatly modify the course of cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis in patients infected with HIV-1."
6070,0.005,1.0000,"A clear understanding of the antiviral effects of CD8(+) T cells in the context of chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is critical for the development of prophylactic vaccines and therapeutics designed to support T-cell-mediated immunity. However, defining the potential correlates of effective CD8(+) T-cell immunity has proven difficult; notably, comprehensive analyses have demonstrated that the size and shape of the CD8(+) T-cell response are not necessarily indicative of efficacy determined by measures of plasma viral load. Here, we conducted a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of CD8(+) T-cell responses to autologous virus in a cohort of six HIV-infected individuals with a history of structured interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (SIT). The magnitude and breadth of the HIV-specific response did not, by themselves, explain the changes observed in plasma virus levels after the cessation of ART. Furthermore, mutational escape from targeted epitopes could not account for the differential virological outcomes in this cohort. However, the functionality of HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations upon antigen encounter, determined by the simultaneous and independent measurement of five CD8(+) T-cell functions (degranulation and gamma interferon, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-2 levels) reflected the emergent level of plasma virus, with multiple functions being elicited in those individuals with lower levels of viremia after SIT. These data show that the quality of the HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell response, rather than the quantity, is associated with the dynamics of viral replication in the absence of ART and suggest that the effects of SIT can be assessed by measuring the functional profile of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells."
5827,0.005,1.0000,"A patient with HIV infection who experienced immune reconstitution after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [increase in CD4 T cell count from <1/microl to >600/microl] presented with severe Graves' disease 32 months after commencing HAART. A comprehensive clinical and laboratory study demonstrated pronounced regional lymphadenopathy and thymic enlargement at presentation, and that the onset of thyrotropin receptor antibody production was associated with increased production of soluble CD30 (a marker of type 2 immune responses). Blood naive CD8 T cell counts and TREC levels in both CD4 and CD8 T cells were increased at multiple time points compared with carefully selected controls. We conclude that the Graves' disease in this patient was associated with abnormally high blood counts of thymus-derived T cells, and propose that Graves' disease after HAART in this and other HIV patients may result from failure to delete autoreactive T cell clones in the regenerating thymus."
345,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is generally high in most resource-limited settings. However, sub-optimal adherence occurs in a sizable proportion of patients, and is independently predictive of detectable viremia. We investigated sub-optimal adherence according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill assessment methods, and their associated factors among HIV-infected adults receiving cART in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Eight-hundred seventy patients who initiated cART between May 2009 and April 2012 were randomly selected, and 664 patients who were alive, had remained in clinical care and were receiving cART for at least six-months were included. Sub-optimal adherence was defined as patients' response of less than ""all-of the time"" to the self-report adherence question, or any clinician-recorded poor adherence during the six most recent clinic visits, or a pharmacy-refill of <95% medication possession ratio (MPR). Logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with sub-optimal adherence. The average adherence level to cART, expressed as MPR, was nearly 97%. However, sub-optimal adherence occurred in 12%, 4%, and 27% of patients according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill measures, respectively. More satisfaction with social support was significantly associated with less sub-optimal adherence according to self-report and clinician-record. Younger age, lower educational level, and lower CD4 cell count at cART initiation were significantly associated with sub-optimal refill-based adherence. Findings from our large multi-center study suggest that sub-optimal adherence was present in up to a quarter of the patients, despite a high degree of average adherence to cART. Interventions aimed at preventing sub-optimal adherence should focus on improving social support, on younger patients, on patients with lower educational level, and on those who started cART at a lower CD4 cell count."
3717,0.005,1.0000,"After responding to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-infected children had a good response to hepatitis B immunization. However, there are limited data on the durability of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) in these children. The primary objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of protective anti-HBs level 3 years after a 3-dose HBV revaccination among HIV-infected children with immune recovery (CD4 cell ≥ 15%) while on HAART. The secondary objective is to assess immunologic memory among children who had waning of anti-HBs. An anti-HBs level of ≥ 10 mIU/mL was defined as a protective antibody level. Sixty-nine HIV-infected children who had history of a 3-dose HBV revaccination while receiving HAART were enrolled. The mean (SD) of CD4 cell and duration of HAART at time of revaccination was 27.2% (6.7) and 5.9 years (0.4), respectively. The proportion of children with protective anti-HBs level 3 years after the revaccination was 71.0% [95% CI, 58.8-81.3]. The geometric mean titer was 114(SD 5)IU/mL. By multivariate logistic analysis, the predictors for protective anti-HBs level 3 years after revaccination were CD4 cell count ≥ 500 cells/mm³ at the time of vaccination (p = 0.04) and anti-HBs level ≥ 100 IU/mL at 1 month after completion of the 3-dose vaccination (p < 0.001). Anamnestic response after one booster dose was demonstrated among 14 of 17 children who had waning protective anti-HBs level (82.4% [95% CI, 62.2-102.6]). Our findings support the recommendation of giving a 3-dose HBV vaccination to HIV-infected children with immune recovery while receiving HAART."
8653,0.005,1.0000,"The evaluation of new cases of HIV infection is relatively common in Spain, where several thousands of patients with new infections are diagnosed each year. Eighty per cent of them have a chronic HIV infection at the first clinical evaluation, which is symptomatic (late presenters) in up to 30% of patients. The initial evaluation of HIV infection is not only directed at determining the clinical, virological (plasma HIV RNA viral load, resistance test and viral tropism) and immunological (CD4+ T-cell cell count) situation of the patients, but must also address the study of their co-infections (hepatitis, tuberculosis) and comorbidities (cardiovascular, hepatic, renal and bone) and the risk of HIV transmission. This is needed in order to decide, whether or not to start antiretroviral treatment, and with which combined antiretroviral treatment to start with, the prophylaxis of opportunistic infections, and the treatment of coinfections and comorbidities. The past and current medical history, the physical examination and laboratory tests will help us decide if the patient is to receive therapeutic intervention. The level of CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes is the best marker to suggest when to start combined antiretroviral treatment, indicating whether or not to start prophylaxis against opportunistic infections (if patients have a CD4+ T-cell count below 200 cells/mm(3)), and in advanced patients should make us suspect the presence of active opportunistic diseases in symptomatic cases. The management of patients with HIV infection must also include appropriate health education on the modes of transmission and prevention of HIV infection, and also to explain its natural history and how it can be modified with proper antiretroviral treatment, as well as to promote a healthy life. No less important is the psychological support, as these patients must learn to live with a chronic infection, which managed properly can ensure a very good long-term prognosis and quality of life."
4259,0.005,1.0000,"It has previously been demonstrated that there are two distinct mechanisms for genetic resistance to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) conferred by the CCR5Delta32 gene: the loss of wild-type CCR5 surface expression and the generation of CCR5Delta32 protein, which interacts with CXCR4. To analyse the protective effects of long-term expression of the CCR5Delta32 protein, recombinant lentiviral vectors were used to deliver the CCR5Delta32 gene into human cell lines and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells that had been immortalized by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Blasticidin S-resistant cell lines expressing the lentivirus-encoded CCR5Delta32 showed a significant reduction in HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion assays. It was shown that CD4(+) T lymphocytes expressing the lentivirus-encoded CCR5Delta32 gene were highly resistant to infection by a primary but not by a laboratory-adapted X4 strain, suggesting different infectivity requirements. In contrast to previous studies that analysed the CCR5Delta32 protective effects in a transient expression system, this study showed that long-term expression of CCR5Delta32 conferred resistance to HIV-1 despite cell-surface expression of the HIV co-receptors. The results suggest an additional unknown mechanism for generating the CCR5Delta32 resistance phenotype and support the hypothesis that the CCR5Delta32 protein acts as an HIV-suppressive factor by altering the stoichiometry of the molecules involved in HIV-1 entry. The lentiviral-CCR5Delta32 vectors offer a method of generating HIV-resistant cells by delivery of the CCR5Delta32 gene that may be useful for stem cell- or T-cell-based gene therapy for HIV-1 infection."
1710,0.005,1.0000,"The clinical and laboratory features of six human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with atypical mycobacterial skeletal infections, seen at a county outpatient HIV facility or university outpatient clinic, are reviewed and compared with other reported cases. Atypical mycobacterial skeletal infections are a manifestation of advanced HIV disease, with most cases having CD4 counts < 100/mm3 at the time these infections become clinically apparent. Multiple sites are frequently involved, and concomitant skin infection with the same organism is common, especially with Mycobacterium haemophilum. The incidence of atypical mycobacterial skeletal infection in HIV-infected individuals was significantly higher than in the general county hospital district patient population, whereas the frequency of Myobacterium tuberculosis skeletal infection did not differ significantly between the two populations. The clinician therefore should maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical mycobacteria in a patient presenting with skeletal infection in the setting of a markedly depressed CD4 count."
3978,0.005,1.0000,"GB virus C (GBV-C), which is highly prevalent among HIV/AIDS, seemed to slow the HIV disease progression. The HIV/GBV-C co-infected individuals may represent an interesting model for the investigation of the role played by HIV infection and/or the immune system in driving the evolution of the GBV-C viral populations. The present study investigated the prevalence and population dynamics of GB virus C in HIV infected individuals representing 13 geographic regions of Hubei Province of China. Approximately 37% of HIV-1 infected individuals were infected with GBV-C and genotype 3 is appeared to be predominant. Utilizing the 196 complete E2 nucleotide sequence data from 10 HIV/GBV-C infected individuals and employing coalescence based phylogenetic approaches; the present study has investigated the intra-host dynamics of GBV-C. The results revealed patient-specific unique GBV-C viral lineages and each viral lineage showed the evidence of rapid population expansion in respective HIV-1 infected patients, thus suggesting HIV-1 was unlikely to have been inhibiting effect on the GBV-C viral replication. GBV-C in all patients has experienced intense purifying selection, suggesting the GBV-C viral invasion and subsequent expansion within the HIV-1 infected hosts without any modification of the functional epitopes at their membrane protein. The finding of within host GBV-C recombinant sequences indicated recombination was one of the significant forces in the evolution and divergence of GBV-C."
9188,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates from Iranian patients around the country were characterized. Eighty-one complete genomes from HBV isolates were sequenced and analyzed. The studied population was grouped into three categories including inactive carriers, patients with chronic hepatitis, and patients with liver cirrhosis. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses revealed that Iranian patients were infected with HBV genotype D and subgenotype D1. The most common subtype was ayw2, followed by ayw3 and ayw4. Several deletions and insertions that had no correlation with disease outcome were observed in the HBV genomes. The most frequent mutation in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was sP120S. Almost half of the patients studied carried precore (PC) mutant variants and one-third of the studied population was infected with variants carrying basal core promoter (BCP) mutations. PC and BCP mutations were observed in older patients, especially in those with chronic liver disease. Sixty-seven patients (82.7%) were HBeAg negative, and the prevalence of precore mutant isolates (G1896A) was higher in this group than in HBeAg-positive patients. Lamivudine drug resistance mutations were detected after 1 year of treatment in about 30% of lamivudine-treated patients. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that HBV subgenotype D1 is the only subgenotype circulating in Iran, and there is no evidence of any exotic genotype in the region. The HBV PC (G1896A) mutation may play an important role in the clinical outcome of the disease by increasing the risk of progressive liver disease among Iranian patients infected with HBV."
2351,0.005,1.0000,"While patients with liver disease are known to have a higher prevalence of glucose intolerance, preliminary studies suggest that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may be an additional risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus. To further study the correlation of HCV infection and diabetes, we performed a retrospective analysis of 1,117 patients with chronic viral hepatitis and analyzed whether age, sex, race, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HCV infection, and cirrhosis were independently associated with diabetes. In addition, a case-control study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of HCV infection in a cohort of 594 diabetics and 377 clinic patients assessed for thyroid disease. In the former study after the exclusion of patients with conditions predisposing to hyperglycemia, diabetes was observed in 21% of HCV-infected patients compared with 12% of HBV-infected subjects (P =.0004). Multivariate analysis revealed that HCV infection (P =.02) and age (P =.01) were independent predictors of diabetes. In the diabetes cohort, 4.2% of patients were found to be infected with HCV compared with 1.6% of control patients (P =.02). HCV genotype 2a was observed in 29% of HCV-RNA-positive diabetic patients versus 3% of local HCV-infected controls (P <.005). In conclusion, the data suggest a relatively strong association between HCV infection and diabetes, because diabetics have an increased frequency of HCV infection, particularly with genotype 2a. Furthermore, it is possible that HCV infection may serve as an additional risk factor for the development of diabetes, beyond that attributable to chronic liver disease alone."
3005,0.005,1.0000,"The TT virus (TTV) was isolated recently from the serum of a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis. TTV infection is widespread in the general population, and its prevalence increases continuously with age. The pathogenic role of TTV in liver disease remains controversial, and the source of transmission is still unclear. We investigated the pathogenicity and epidemiology of TTV infection in infants born to TTV DNA-positive mothers. Enrolled in this study were 22 mother-child pairs testing negative for antibodies to hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs). The children were followed for 30 months after birth. Serum TTV DNA was detected by N22-PCR, and the PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The prevalence of TTV infection in children increased with age. Of the 22 children, 13 (59%) became positive for TTV DNA during the follow-up period. Of these 13 children, 6 (46%) had elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), although the elevations were transient and mild. TTV viremia was not associated significantly with the abnormal ALT levels. Children with TTV viremia developed neither severe liver disease nor fulminant hepatitis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that, in 11 (85%) of the 13 pairs, the mother and child had the same genotype at the first PCR-positive time point. Among those 11 mother-child pairs, 6 (55%) had identical TTV nucleotide sequences. However, the genotype of predominant clones changed in 5 (50%) of 10 children who were positive for TTV DNA at two or more time points during the follow-up period. In conclusion, this study did not provide evidence that TTV infection is related to liver disease in children. Although the main source of TTV infection in children is presumed to be their mothers, transmitted via non-parenteral routes in the course of daily contact, intrafamilial carriers may also be sources of TTV infection."
7231,0.005,1.0000,"Recent genome-wide association studies report that the SNP rs8099917, located 8.9 kb upstream of the start codon of IL28B, is associated with both disease chronicity and therapeutic response to pegIFN-α and RBV in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. To determine the effect of rs8099917 variation on the response of HCV to therapy, we genotyped this variant in a cohort of 160 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients in our clinic unit who received combined peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy. The rs8099917 T/G or G/G genotypes were observed in 56 patients (35%). Treatment failure occurred in 80% of G-allele carriers versus 48% of non-carriers (P<0.0001). This result reveals that the G allele was strongly associated with treatment failure in this patient cohort. Importantly, a highly significant association was found between the G-allele and response to therapy in HCV genotype 1-infected patients (P<0.0001) but not in HCV genotype 3-infected patients. Multivariate analysis (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval; P value) indicated that the rs8099917 TT genotype was a strong predictor of treatment success (5.83; 1.26-26.92; P = 0.021), independent of baseline plasma HCV-RNA load less than 500 000 IU/ml (4.85; 1.18-19.95; P = 0.025) and absence of advanced liver fibrosis (5.24; 1.20-22.91; P = 0.025). These results reveal the high prevalence of the rs8099917 G allele in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients as well as its strong association with treatment failure in HCV genotype 1-infected patients. rs8099917 SNP genotyping may be a valid pre-treatment predictor of which patients are likely to respond to treatment in this group of difficult-to-treat HCV/HIV-infected patients."

This study examined the association between depression, viral load, and acculturation with physical function among Latino men living with HIV. A secondary data analysis was performed using a cross-sectional data of 146 Latino immigrant men living with HIV in New York City and Washington, DC. Physical function was measured using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Uncontrolled HIV infection and depression were associated with worse physical function, thus implying the importance of adequate health care to address these conditions. Preserving physical function should start during middle adulthood, particularly among people living with HIV because of their greater risk of developing age-related challenges such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases among others. This study informs future interventions to preserve physical function and achieve the goal of successful aging."
8980,0.005,1.0000,"CD4 T cell depletion is central to HIV pathogenesis and disease progression. Different subsets of CD4 T cells cooperate to combat an infection. Therefore, the immune balance among Th17, Th1, and Treg cells may be critical in HIV immunopathogenesis which is not adequately defined yet. The impact of HIV-1 infection on the interplay of Th17/Th1/Treg cells in HIV-1 infected Indian individuals was examined in the present study and report that HIV-1 Gag specific peripheral blood Th17 cells were significantly depleted in late infected subjects, compared to early infected subjects and slow progressors. Although, the gradual loss of Th1 cells was also reported during HIV-1 disease progression but relative to Th17 cells, Th1 cells were found to be more resistant to HIV-1 infection. Additionally, a significant and progressive gain in Treg cellular frequency was observed as disease progress from early to late stage of HIV-1 infection. This study also indicate that slow progressors might have an intrinsic capacity to develop strong HIV-1 specific Th17 and Th1 cell responses contrasted with a faint Treg cellular performance signifies the importance of these cellular subsets in progressive versus nonprogressive HIV-1 infection. A significant gradual loss of Th17/Treg ratio was found to be associated with disease state, plasma viral load and immune activation."
1734,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the population of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals from Slovenia and Croatia was determined. One hundred and sixty-six out of a total of 188 Slovenian HIV-1-infected individuals and 120 subjects who were randomly chosen out of a total 342 Croatian HIV-1 antibodies-positive individuals were tested for HCV infection. Detection of HCV antibodies was carried out by a third generation enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and the positive samples were additionally tested by a third generation immuno-blot assay. Additionally, the presence of HCV RNA was determined in all serum samples by a qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Twenty-four (14.5%) out of 166 Slovenian and 18 (15.0%) out of 120 Croatian HIV-1-infected individuals were HCV antibodies-positive. Nineteen out of 24 (79.2%) Slovenian and 13 out of 18 (72.2%) Croatian anti-HCV positive individuals were also viremic. HCV RNA was not detected in any of 244 HCV antibodies-negative/HIV-1-infected individual from both countries. A significant difference in the prevalence of HCV infection between blood (77.8% in Slovenia and 66.7% in Croatia) and sexual exposure risk groups (1.6% in Slovenia and 6.6% in Croatia) was found in both countries. In a study carried out on the highest proportion of entire population of HIV-1-infected individuals from a certain country or geographic region, Slovenia and Croatia were identified as countries with the second and third lowest prevalence of HCV infection among HIV-1/HIV-2 infected individuals worldwide."
9061,0.005,1.0000,"Evaluation of metabolic factors and elevated γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels as independent predictors of treatment failure in a thoroughly documented cohort of HIV-/HCV-coinfected patients (HIV/HCV). Sixty-four HIV/HCV patients treated with pegylated interferon-α-2a plus ribavirin (PEGIFN + RBV) at the Medical University of Vienna within a prospective trial were included in this study. In addition, 124 patients with HIV/HCV from the AIFA-HIV and AHIVCOS cohorts were included as a validation cohort. Advanced liver fibrosis, GGT elevation, insulin resistance (IR) and low CD4+ nadir were defined as METAVIR F3/F4, GGT levels >1.5× sex-specific upper limit of normal, homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance >2 and CD4+ nadir <350 cells/μL, respectively. HCV-genotype 1/4 (OR26.3; P = 0.006), advanced liver fibrosis (OR20.2; P = 0.009), interleukin 28B rs12979860 non-C/C SNP (OR8.27; P = 0.02) and GGT elevation (OR7.97; P = 0.012) were independent predictors of treatment failure, while both IR (OR3.51; P = 0.106) and low CD4 + nadir (OR2.64; P = 0.263) were not independently associated with treatment failure. A statistically significant correlation between GGT elevation and prior alcohol abuse (r = 0.259; P = 0.039), liver steatosis (r = 0.301; P = 0.034) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (r = -0.256; P = 0.041) was observed. The importance of GGT elevation as an independent predictor of treatment failure was confirmed in a validation cohort (OR2.76; P = 0.026). While GGT elevation emerged as an independent predictor of treatment failure in both the derivation and the validation cohort, no independent associations between metabolic factors and treatment failure were observed. Thus, our findings suggest that GGT elevation is an independent predictor of treatment failure in HIV/HCV that can easily be incorporated into predictive algorithms. "

Lactotransferrin is present in the breast milk and in the female genitourinary mucosa and it has been hypothesised as a possible candidate to prevent mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission. To verify if two functional polymorphisms, Thr29Ala and Arg47Lys, in the lactotransferrin encoding gene (LTF) could affect HIV-1 infection and vertical transmission, a preliminary association study was performed in 238 HIV-1 positive and 99 HIV-1 negative children from Brazil, Italy, Africa and India. No statistically significant association for the Thr29Ala and Arg47Lys LTF polymorphisms and HIV-1 susceptibility in the studied populations was found. Additionally LTF polymorphisms frequencies were compared between the four different ethnic groups. "

The in silico designed viral genome was divided into 4 fragments, which were chemically synthesized and joined together by conventional subcloning. Subsequently, gag-protease-reverse-transcriptase (GPRT) fragments from 8 HIV-1 subtype C-infected patient samples were RT-PCR-amplified and cloned into the HIV-1-C backbone (deleted for GPRT) using In-Fusion reagents. Recombinant viruses (1 to 5 per patient sample) were produced in MT4-eGFP cells where cyto-pathogenic effect (CPE), p24 and Viral Load (VL) were monitored. The resulting HIV-1-C recombinant virus stocks (RVS) were added to MT4-eGFP cells in the presence of serial dilutions of antiretroviral drugs (PI, NNRTI, NRTI) to determine the fold-change in IC50 compared to the IC50 of wild-type HIV-1 virus. Additionally, viral RNA was extracted from the HIV-1-C RVS and the amplified GPRT products were used to generate recombinant virus in a subtype B backbone. Phenotypic resistance profiles in a subtype B and subtype C backbone were compared. The following observations were made: i) functional, infectious HIV-1 subtype C viruses were generated, confirmed by VL and p24 measurements; ii) their rate of infection was slower than viruses generated in the subtype B backbone; iii) they did not produce clear CPE in MT4 cells; and iv) drug resistance profiles generated in both backbones were very similar, including re-sensitizing effects like M184V on AZT."
668,0.005,1.0000,"Human papilloma virus (HPV) causes focal infections of epithelial layers in skin and mucosa. HIV-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) appear to be at increased risk of developing HPV-induced oral warts. To identify the mechanisms that allow long-term infection of oral epithelial cells in these patients, we used a combination of laser-dissection microscopy (LDM) and highly sensitive and quantitative, non-biased, two-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR to study pathogen-induced alterations of specific tissue subcompartments. Expression of 166 genes was compared in three distinct epithelial and subepithelial compartments isolated from biopsies of normal mucosa from HIV-infected and non-infected patients and of HPV32-induced oral warts from HIV-infected patients. In contrast to the underlying HIV infection and/or HAART, which did not significantly elaborate tissue substructure-specific effects, changes in oral warts were strongly tissue substructure-specific. HPV 32 seems to establish infection by selectively enhancing epithelial cell growth and differentiation in the stratum spinosum and to evade the immune system by actively suppressing inflammatory responses in adjacent underlying tissues. With this highly sensitive and quantitative method tissue-specific expression of hundreds of genes can be studied simultaneously in a few cells. Because of its large dynamic measurement range it could also become a method of choice to confirm and better quantify results obtained by microarray analysis."
4996,0.005,1.0000,"Depression is associated with poor antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS. This relationship may be moderated by an individual's social network characteristics. Our study sought to examine social network correlates of treatment adherence among HIV-positive men recruited from social service agencies throughout Los Angeles County (N = 150) to inform technology-driven social support interventions for this population. We administered egocentric social network and computer-assisted survey interviews focused on demographic characteristics, health history, depressive symptoms, and ART adherence, where adherence was assessed by the number of reasons participants missed taking their medication, if ever. Significant univariate correlates of adherence were included in a multivariable regression analysis, where the moderating effect of having a network member who reminds participants to take their HIV medication on the relationship between depression and adherence was tested. Over 60% of participants reported clinically significant depressive symptoms; this was significantly associated with lower adherence among those without someone in their social network to remind them about taking their HIV medication, even after adjusting for covariates in an ordinary least squares regression (adjusted mean difference b = -1.61, SE = 0.42, p = 0.0003). Having a network member who reminds participants to take their ART medication significantly ameliorated the negative association between depression and treatment adherence, especially for those reporting greater depressive symptoms (p = 0.0394). Additionally, participants demonstrated high rates of technology use to communicate with social network members. In order to achieve the aims of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, innovative interventions addressing mental health to improve ART adherence are needed. Network strategies that leverage technology may be helpful for improving ART adherence among HIV-positive men with comorbid depressive symptoms."
6400,0.005,1.0000,"Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are characterized by the combined expression of the semi-invariant T cell receptor (TCR) Vα7.2, the lectin receptor CD161, as well as IL-18R, and play an important role in antibacterial host defense of the gut. The current study characterized CD161(+) MAIT and CD161-TCRVα7.2(+) T cell subsets within a large cohort of HIV patients with emphasis on patients with slow disease progression and elite controllers. Mononuclear cells from blood and lymph node samples as well as plasma from 63 patients and 26 healthy donors were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry and ELISA for IL-18, sCD14 and sCD163. Additionally, MAIT cells were analyzed after in vitro stimulation with different cytokines and/or fixed E.coli. Reduced numbers of CD161(+) MAIT cells during HIV infection were detectable in the blood and lymph nodes of all patient groups, including elite controllers. CD161+ MAIT cell numbers did not recover even after successful antiretroviral treatment. The loss of CD161(+) MAIT cells was correlated with higher levels of MAIT cell activation; an increased frequency of the CD161-TCRVα7.2(+)T cell subset in HIV infection was observed. In vitro stimulation of MAIT cells with IL-18 and IL-12, IL-7 and fixed E.coli also resulted in a rapid and additive reduction of the MAIT cell frequency defined by CD161, IL-18R and CCR6. In summary, the irreversible reduction of the CD161(+) MAIT cell subset seems to be an early event in HIV infection that is independent of later stages of the disease. This loss appears to be at least partially due to the distinctive vulnerability of MAIT cells to the pronounced stimulation by microbial products and cytokines during HIV-infection."
7252,0.005,1.0000,"Using an anonymous questionnaire to obtain baseline data on sexual behaviour and knowledge of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among students in university residences, the following information was obtained: Knowledge of AIDS was found to be high, although misconceptions regarding transmission of the virus were prevalent. Mosquito bites (15%) and the donating of blood (31%) were incorrectly identified as methods of transmission of the virus. Deep kissing was recognised by only 27% of the students as a possible method of transmission while 22% and 13% of the students, respectively, failed to identify the sharing of razor blades and blood transfusions as possible means of contracting HIV infection. The students' knowledge had not greatly affected sexual behaviour. Two-thirds of the respondents had previously had sexual contact; 38% were sexually active at the time of the study, and of these 74% had engaged in unprotected intercourse with casual partners in the previous 6 months. There was a negative attitude towards condom use and over 80% of sexually active students did not perceive themselves to be at risk of contracting AIDS. Campus Health (82%), State health services (51%), and public advertisements (60%) were preferred sources of AIDS information. Newspapers/magazines (80%) and leaflets (69%) were identified as the preferred media. In reality, significantly fewer students obtained their information from Campus Health (15%; P less than 0.05), State health services (19%, P less than 0.05) and leaflets (44%; P less than 0.05). It can be concluded that education programmes should be developed by credible organisations to ensure that an awareness of AIDS results in appropriate sexual behaviour."

Thus, new approaches are needed to provide these individuals with risk-reduction strategies. We review our research on young adults' sexual decision making by using theories and methods from social and cognitive sciences. Four patterns of condom use and associated levels of risks and beliefs were identified. These patterns suggest value in targeting intervention strategies to individuals at different levels of risk. The findings also imply that the monogamous population may be at higher risk for infection than they realize. Primary-care physicians are the first line of contact for many individuals in the health care system and may be in the best position to screen for at-risk individuals. Given the time demands and other barriers, easy-to-use, evidence-based guidelines for such screening are needed. We propose such guidelines for primary-care physicians to use in identifying an individual's risk, from which custom-tailored intervention strategies can be developed."

The inability to mimic the complexity of the liver using cell lines and regular primary human hepatocyte (PHH) cultures pose significant limitations for studying host/pathogen interactions. Here, we describe a 3D microfluidic PHH system permissive to HBV infection, which can be maintained for at least 40 days. This system enables the recapitulation of all steps of the HBV life cycle, including the replication of patient-derived HBV and the maintenance of HBV cccDNA. We show that innate immune and cytokine responses following infection with HBV mimic those observed in HBV-infected patients, thus allowing the dissection of pathways important for immune evasion and validation of biomarkers. Additionally, we demonstrate that the co-culture of PHH with other non-parenchymal cells enables the identification of the cellular origin of immune effectors, thus providing a valuable preclinical platform for HBV research."

Clearance rates of HIV RNA and HIV DNA in peripheral blood as well as the preexistence and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of HIV were determined over 52 weeks of treatment. The data indicate that HAART is able to induce a suppression of plasma viral load together with a significant decrease, but not a suppression, of peripheral blood mononuclear cell-associated proviral DNA in PHI subjects. Analysis of drug-resistant strains revealed that three PHI patients, showing a complete virologic response, developed mutations in the pol gene, thus suggesting that a persistent residual virus replication exists despite a sustained suppression of plasma viremia."

The phenotypic characteristics of the HIV-1 isolates obtained from the HCW and markers of virus load were followed for 20 months. Although the HCW was initially infected with an SI strain, within 75 days of infection the isolate became non-SI and remained so for > or = 635 days. Even though the AIDS patient had a zidovudine-resistant virus, the HCW was infected with a zidovudine-sensitive virus. Plasma RNA levels peaked 20 days after infection, declined rapidly within 2 weeks, and remained stable for the duration of follow-up. Similarly, the HCW's CD4 lymphocyte count remained stable throughout the study. Thus, selection for non-SI and zidovudine-sensitive virus occurred in the HCW, who, after initial symptomatic infection associated with high levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA, developed low plasma RNA copy numbers and stable CD4 lymphocyte counts."
6516,0.005,1.0000,"Brazilian AIDS and HIV-1-seropositive patients have had free access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) since November 1996. Although secondary data based on official mortality statistics indicate a sharp decrease in AIDS mortality, few if any studies tried to estimate the prognosis for patients with HIV who have been followed from the beginning of the HAART era. An observational study, with retrospective and prospective components, was done in 233 adult HIV-1-infected subjects who were recruited in the last 10 years at the outpatient sector of the Secondary Immunodeficiencies Clinic of the Department of Dermatology, Hospital das Clinicas da FMUSP, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The definition of AIDS followed the guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in 1987. One hundred sixty patients were asymptomatic, 46 had AIDS, 24 had AIDS-related complex, and 3 presented with acute infection at study entry. Twenty-nine (18%) of the asymptomatic subjects developed AIDS during follow-up, with 5 (3%) deaths. Among the 46 AIDS cases at entry, 7 (17%) died during follow-up. Thus, a total of 12 people (5.2%) died of AIDS in this cohort over a mean follow-up of 5.2 years and 24 people were lost to follow-up (10.3%). Ninety percent of the survivors were on combined therapy (82% with 3 or more drugs, and 8% with 2 drugs), while 10% were not taking antiretrovirals. People with AIDS at entry were 5 times more likely to die during this period compared to patients who were asymptomatic at entry (p = 0.006). Women showed better outcomes than men, reflecting differences in CD4+ T-cell counts at study entry. All but 1 patient progressed to AIDS during the pre-HAART era (before 1996). In spite of its recent decline, mortality from AIDS-related conditions remains an important public health issue."
9987,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) successfully escapes from host immune surveillance, vaccines and antiretroviral agents. The available antiretroviral compounds can only control viremia, but it is impossible to eliminate the virus from the organism, namely because HIV-1 provirus persists in the reservoir cells from which the virus repeatedly disseminates into new cells. Current therapeutic approaches, however, do not specifically address the stage of virus reactivation. Heme has been demonstrated as very efficient in inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcription, while its derivative hemin ameliorated HIV-1 infection via induction of heme oxygenase-1. Normosang (heme arginate; HA) is a human hemin-containing compound used to treat acute porphyria. In this work, we studied the effects of HA in HIV-1-acutely infected T-cell lines, and in cell lines harboring either a complete HIV-1 provirus (ACH-2 cells) or an HIV-1 ""mini-virus"" (Jurkat clones expressing EGFP under control of HIV LTR). We demonstrate that HA inhibited HIV-1 replication during the acute infection, which was accompanied by the inhibition of reverse transcription. On the other hand, HA alone stimulated the reactivation of HIV-1 ""mini-virus"" and synergized with phorbol ester or TNF-α in the reactivation of HIV-1 provirus. The stimulatory effects of HA were inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine, suggesting an increased redox stress and activation of NF-κB. Further, HA induced expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in ACH-2 cells, while HO-1 was found expressed in untreated Jurkat clones. Inhibitor of HO-1 activity, tin protoporphyrin IX, further increased HA-mediated reactivation of HIV-1 ""mini-virus"" in Jurkat clones, and this effect was also inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine. The stimulatory effects of HA on HIV-1 reactivation thus seem to involve HO-1 and generation of free radicals. Additionally, the effective concentrations of HA did neither affect normal T-cell activation with PMA nor induce activation of the unstimulated cells. In conclusion, HA appears to possess a combination of unique properties that could help to decrease the pool of latently infected reservoir cells, while simultaneously inhibiting HIV-1 replication in newly infected cells. Our results thus suggest a new direction to explore in treatment of HIV/AIDS disease."
8182,0.005,1.0000,"The proposed study is a Phase I trial to evaluate a HIV-based lentiviral vector carrying an antisense sequence targeted to HIV in the treatment of HIV infection. The primary objective of this Phase I study is to determine the safety and tolerability of treatment with autologous CD4+ T cells modified (transduced) ex vivo with VRX496 when administered to HIV-infected patients. VRX496 is a completely gutted lentiviral vector and does not code for any viral proteins. The viral vector contains an antisense sequence targeted to the HIV envelope (env) gene. VRX496 directly interferes with wild-type HIV (wt-HIV) expression via anti-env antisense expression in vector transduced CD4 cells that become infected with wt-HIV. Expression of the anti-HIV antisense env from a HIV vector transcript would target wt-HIV RNA and destroy it, and hence, decrease productive HIV replication from CD4 T cells. The clinical goal for this treatment approach is to decrease viral loads and promote CD4 T cell survival in vivo. Data from in vitro studies suggest that HIV vectors such as VRX496 could potentially reduce viral loads in HIV-infected individuals and thus could delay the onset to AIDS while promoting CD4 T cell survival and providing the immune system with a better chance to control the infection. Additionally, preliminary results from experiments in SCID mice (mice with transplanted human immune cells) indicate that the human cells transduced with VRX496 and implanted into the SCID mice do not elicit any overt adverse effects. HIV-infected patients (CD4 T cell count of >200/mm3, discontinued from HAART therapy) will undergo leukoapheresis with subsequent CD4 T cell isolation. Patient CD4 T cells will be transduced ex vivo with the vector, expanded for 8-11 days, and then the modified cells will be reintroduced into the patient. Each subject will receive a single intravenous injection infused over 30 minutes; subjects will be examined 24, 48, and 72 hours post-injection and weekly for 4 weeks. Patients will receive one of four different ascending doses (1 x 10(9), 3 x 10(9), 1 x 10(10), and 3 X 10(10) cells/patient). Doses will be administered to four independent, sequential subject cohorts of 3 patients. Groups will be administered escalating doses at 6-week intervals after safety has been demonstrated in the previous group. Follow-up examinations will be conducted 1, 3, and 6 months post-injection. Long term follow-up including RCR testing will be performed."

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in relation to anaemia and CD4 counts among HIV-infected patients in Benin City, Nigeria. Using a serial sampling method, a total of 2000 HIV-infected patients were recruited on their first visit prior to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital from August 2007 to August 2009. Stool and blood samples were collected from each patient. The stool samples were processed using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique to microscopically identify the oocysts of Cryptosporidium species, Isospora belli, Cyclospora species and spores of Microsporidium species while saline and iodine preparations were used for identifying the ova, cysts and parasites of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Taenia spp and other parasites. The blood specimens were equally analyzed using the flow cytometry for CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and autoanalyzer - sysmex kx - 21 for haemoglobin concentration. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 93.3% while 18% had parasitic infections. There was a significant relationship between CD4 count <200cells/microL and anaemia (P<0.0001). Cryptosporidium species (P= 0.005), A. lumbricoides (P=0.035), hookworm and Taenia species (P=0.014) were associated with anaemia. Anaemia was associated with CD4 count while Cryptosporidium species, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species were the intestinal parasitic agents associated with anaemia. In conclusion the prevalence of anaemia in HIV-infected patients is high low CD4 count is a significant risk factor of acquiring anaemia. Except for isosporiasis, cryptosporidiosis, A. lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species in HIV infected individuals are parasitic agents associated with anaemia. Routine screening for intestinal parasites and holistic management of anaemia is advocated."

Indeed, they are crucial for the regulation of T lymphocyte homeostasis because they can influence cell proliferation. A strong debate exists on the importance of Fas/FasL system during HIV infection, which is characterized by the loss of CD4+ T cells directly, or indirectly, caused by the virus. To investigate whether the genetic background of the host plays a role in the immunoreconstitution, we studied the influence of different Fas and FasL polymorphisms on CD4+ T lymphocyte count and plasma viral load following initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in drug-naïve HIV+ patients. We studied 131 individuals, who were compared to 136 healthy donors. Statistical analysis was performed by using Chi2 test, Fischer's Exact Test, and analysis for repeated measurements. The group of HIV+ patients had an unexpected lower frequency of FasLnt169 polymorphism (delT allele) than healthy controls (p = 0.039). We then observed no significant differences in the immune reconstitution, in terms of CD4+ T cell increase, when the influence of single alleles of the gene Fas or FasL was considered. However, the combination of some polymorphisms of Fas or FasL significantly influenced CD4+ T cell production and viral load decrease, showing that these genes can play a role in the immunoreconstitution triggered by antiretroviral therapy."

Moreover, improvements in supportive care have allowed HIV-infected patients with life-threatening hematological disorders to be treated with Allo-HSCT. We report on four HIV-infected patients with hematological malignancies receiving an Allo-HSCT in our institution, and on the use of donor lymphocyte infusions to successfully treat post-Allo-HSCT relapse. Of note, one of them is the first HIV(+) patient to receive a ""dual transplant"" (unrelated umbilical cord blood stem cells combined with mobilized T cell-depleted CD34(+) stem cells from a mismatched third party donor). cART drugs interactions were satisfactorily managed. This approach provided long-term control of the hematological disease. Nevertheless, despite adequate immune reconstitution, infections were the main cause of morbidity and mortality after Allo-HSCT."
8948,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) probably play the major role in controlling HIV replication. However, the value of adoptive transfer of HIV-specific CTL expanded in vitro to HIV+ patients has been limited: this contrasts with the success of CTL therapy in treating or preventing Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus disease after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We investigated the fate of expanded HIV-specific CTL clones in vivo following adoptive transfer to a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two autologous CTL clones specific for HIV Gag and Pol were expanded to large numbers (>10(9)) in vitro and infused into an HIV-infected patient whose viral load was rising despite antiretroviral therapy. The fate of one clone was monitored by staining peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with T-cell receptor-specific tetrameric major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complexes. Although the CTL transfer was well tolerated, there were no significant changes in CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts and virus load. By tracking an infused clone using soluble MHC-peptide complexes, we show that cells bearing the Gag-specific T-cell receptors were rapidly eliminated within hours of infusion through apoptosis. Thus, the failure of adoptively transferred HIV-specific CTL to reduce virus load in AIDS may be due to rapid apoptosis of the infused cells, triggered by a number of potential mechanisms. Further trials of adoptive transfer of CTL should take into account the susceptibility of infused cells to in vivo apoptosis."
2454,0.005,1.0000,"A number of infected individuals develop neuropathological disorders, such as AIDS dementia complex (ADC), as a consequence of HIV/AIDS. The biological features governing HIV entry and tropism in different brain cell types remain unclear, as do the genetics of the virus regulating these events and the neuropathogenic processes within the brain tissues. HIV-1 was isolated from the right and left parietal, occipital, and frontal lobes of the brain cortex of three HIV-1-infected patients: two with ADC and one without. The viral strains were studied from the innate tissues and various primary cell cultures. The kinetics and tropism of viral strains from different brain regions showed clear differences on various primary cell types (monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and T cells), which could discriminate between biological behavior of HIV-1 strains from patients with and without ADC. The variable effect of different donor cells on tropism was also clearly evident. The majority (with a few exceptions) of isolates from different brain regions of all three patients used CCR5 as coreceptor for entry. The consistent CCR5 use, macrophage tropism, and non-syncytium-inducing phenotype were the main characteristics of the brain-derived HIV-1 strains from all three patients. Importantly, viral strains derived directly from innate brain tissue of the patient without ADC showed some differences from the cultured variants of the same patient, whereas those from brain tissue of the patients with ADC were more similar to the culture-adapted strains. This suggests that the emergence of primary cell type-adapted isolates during ADC may play a crucial role in the development and progression of the neuropathology associated with ADC. The different genotypes residing in different areas of brain combined with their differential tropism and coreceptor use suggest that neurotropic variants exist that may be governing the neurological manifestation of HIV disease in infected patients."
2430,0.005,1.0000,"As thymocyte infection may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for CD4+ T lymphocyte depletion in HIV-1-infected individuals, we studied the occurrence of HIV-1 infection in the thymus in vivo. Thymus (THYPD) and peripheral blood (PBLPD) primary viral isolates were obtained from an HIV-1-infected patient; restriction pattern analysis revealed the presence of a viral variant (THY) in the thymus isolate, from which biological viral clones containing this variant were obtained by limiting dilution infection of Molt-3 cells. The biological phenotype of the viral isolates and THY clones was studied in different cell lines and primary cultures. PBLPD, THYPD, and THY clones could efficiently infect T cell lines; the thymic variant showed a higher cytopathic activity in T cell lines, and a higher replication capacity in both unfractionated and CD4+CD8(+)-enriched primary thymocytes. Sequence analysis of the viral population patterns in vivo confirmed the presence of the THY variant in the thymic compartment, and revealed that the degree of V3 loop heterogeneity was higher in the thymocytes of the patient than in the peripheral blood lymphocytes. In addition to confirming thymocyte infection in vivo, our data also indicate that a differential distribution of viral variants may occur among different body compartments in a single individual; the emergence of cytopathic and tissue-specific variants in the thymus may play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease."
9671,0.005,1.0000,"Even though potent antiretrovirals are available against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, therapy fails in a significant fraction of patients. Among the most relevant reasons for treatment failure are drug toxicity and side effects, but also the development of viral resistance towards the drugs applied. Efflux by ATP-binding cassette (ABC-) transporters represents one major mechanism influencing the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs and particularly their distribution, thus modifiying the concentration within the infected cells, that is, at the site of action. Moreover, drug-drug interactions may occur at the level of these transporters and modulate their activity or expression thus influencing the efficacy and toxicity of the substrate drugs. This review summarizes current knowledge on the interaction of antiretrovirals used for HIV-1 therapy with ABC-transporters and highlights the impact of ABC-transporters for cellular resistance and therapeutic success. Moreover, the suitability of different cell models for studying the interaction of antiretrovirals with ABC-transporters is discussed."
7394,0.005,1.0000,"In the USA and West Europe, nearly 80% of HIV-1-infected adults, experiencing virologic failure, harbored virus strain resistant to at least one antiretroviral drug. Limited data are available on antiretroviral drug resistance in pediatric HIV infection. The aims of this study were to analyze prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and to identify risk factors associated with resistance in this population. Prevalence of genotypic resistance was estimated retrospectively in treated children who experienced virologic failure (with HIV-1-RNA > 500 copies/ml) followed in Necker hospital between 2001 and 2003. Among 119 children with resistance testing, prevalence of resistance to any drug was 82.4%. Resistance ranged from 76.5% to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), to 48.7% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and 42.9% to protease inhibitor (PI). Resistance to at least one drug of two classes and three classes (triple resistance) was 31.9 and 26.9%, respectively. Resistance was not associated with geographic origin, HIV-1 subtype, and CDC status. In multivariate analysis, resistance to any drug remained associated independently with current low viral load and high lifetime number of past PI. Triple resistance was independently associated with the high lifetime number of past PI and with gender, particularly among children aged 11 years old or more with a prevalence seven times higher in boys than in girls. In conclusion, antiretroviral resistance is common among treated HIV-1-infected children and prevalence was similar with those observed in adult population in the same year period. However, adolescent boys seem to be at greater risk."
1219,0.005,1.0000,"Nonadherence with medical treatment is a critical threat to the health of those living with HIV disease. Unfortunately the search for explanatory factors for nonadherence is still not fully developed, particularly in the area of religion and spirituality. Extant literature suggests that church attendance, religious practices and spiritual beliefs may improve health and generally benefit patients. However, religious beliefs may also play a negative role in treatment adherence due to the stigma attached to HIV disease, particularly in geographical areas and in population subgroups where religious practices are strong. In this exploratory study, HIV-positive individuals (n = 306) in a southern state were surveyed as to their attitudes and beliefs surrounding HIV disease and adherence with medical treatment for the disease. The results indicate that multiple factors influence adherence with treatment and that certain religious practices are positively associated with adherence, but certain religious beliefs are negatively related to adherence. The findings of this study reinforce the importance of remembering and addressing a patient's religious beliefs as a part of medical care."
6917,0.005,1.0000,"In a recent randomized controlled trial, the use of protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) was associated with a significantly lower incidence of malaria compared with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus-infected Ugandan children living in an area of high malaria transmission intensity. In this report, we compared the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia and gametocytemia using data from the same cohort. The prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia did not differ between the two ART treatment arms. The PI-based arm was associated with a lower risk of gametocytemia at the time of diagnosis of malaria (6.6% versus 14.5%, P = 0.03) and during the 28 days after malaria diagnosis (3.4% versus 6.5%, P = 0.04). Thus, in addition to decreasing the incidence of malaria, the use of PI-based ART may lower transmission, as a result of a decrease in gametocytemia, in areas of high malaria transmission intensity."
6426,0.005,1.0000,"Europe is currently observing a significant rise in non-B subtypes. Consequently, the effect of genetic variability on therapy response or genotypic resistance interpretation algorithms is an emerging concern. The purpose of this study is to investigate the amino acid substitutions selected under drug pressure in the protease of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes B and G, and determine if there are any significant differences. We investigated therapy-related and subtype-related substitutions in the protease, considering subtype, overall protease inhibitor treatment and individual drug exposure. Many mutations were significantly related to protease inhibitor (PI) therapy, with mutations exclusive to subtype B or subtype G. Some mutations are at positions related to resistance in both subtypes, but the amino acid substitution is different. Other mutations were significantly associated with subtype and PI selective pressure (p<0.05), pointing towards a differential selective pressure in both subtypes. We confirmed previous reports on the subtype-dependent selection of D30N and 89I, and identified a new mutation with such differential selective pressure: 37D was preferentially selected by lopinavir in subtype B. Other novel mutations found under therapy pressure were 13A, 35N, K55R, I66F, I72L/T, T74S, 82M and 89I/V. Our study indicates that even though in general, drug selective pressure and resistance pathways are relatively similar between subtypes B and G, some differences do occur, leading to subtype-dependent substitutions."
8501,0.005,1.0000,"We assessed the relationship between atazanavir (ATV)-based antiretroviral treatment (ART) and plasma hepatitis C virus (HCV) viral load in a population of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who received ART based on a protease inhibitor (PI) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) were included. Patients were stratified by ART drug [ATV/rtv, lopinavir (LPV/rtv), efavirenz (EFV), nevirapine (NVP), and other PIs], HCV genotype (1/4 and 2/3), and IL28B genotype (CC and non-CC). The Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-squared test were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Multivariate analysis consisted of a stepwise linear regression analysis. Six hundred and forty-nine HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were included. HCV genotype 1/4 patients who received ATV had higher HCV RNA levels [6.57 (5.9-6.8) log IU/ml] than those who received LPV [6.1 (5.5-6.5) log IU/ml], EFV [6.1 (5.6-6.4) log IU/ml], NVP [5.8 (5.5-5.9) log IU/ml], or other PIs [6.1 (5.7-6.4) log IU/ml] (p=0.014). This association held for the IL28B genotype (CC versus non-CC). The association was not found in patients carrying HCV genotypes 2/3. The linear regression model identified the IL28B genotype and ATV use as independent factors associated with HCV RNA levels. ATV-based therapy may be associated with a higher HCV RNA viral load in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients."
2512,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-associated immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has decreased in incidence 10-fold since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). For patients with detectable HIV viral loads, first-line treatment approaches involve optimizing HAART followed by standard ITP options used to treat those without HIV infection. In the general population, the thrombopoetin receptor agonists (TRAs), eltrombopag and romiplostim, are effective when used as salvage ITP therapy. In addition, eltrombopag has been used effectively in patients with thrombocytopenia secondary to hepatitis C--a virus seen commonly in HIV-infected patients, especially in those who also have a history of intravenous drug use. There are, however, few reports or studies of TRAs use in those with HIV infection. Herein, we describe 5 cases of refractory HIV-associated ITP managed with TRAs. Although platelet counts improved for all patients, 2 patients succumbed to thromboembolic complications. Our initial experience, as well as our findings from a Medline review, supports the potential utility of TRA as salvage therapy in the treatment of HIV-related ITP; however, we recommend caution in the use of these agents in those who are at highest risk of thrombosis. Additional studies are needed to determine the efficacy and, more importantly, the safety of TRAs in treatment of HIV-associated ITP."
7211,0.005,1.0000,"The general methods used for public health surveillance of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases and of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are no different from those used for other diseases and infections. However, the methods used must be adapted to the unique epidemiology, wide variation in prevalences, and the very long incubation period of HIV infections. In addition, the severity of AIDS and the extreme social and personal implications of identifying HIV-infected persons make surveillance of AIDS cases and HIV infections much more difficult and place paramount importance on issues such as anonymity and confidentiality. Information on the occurrence of AIDS cases is essential for planning and developing the clinical and laboratory facilities needed for treatment and care of patients with the disease. However, surveillance of AIDS cases is of limited value for assessing the magnitude and future trends of the pandemic because the number of such cases detected, diagnosed, and reported reflect HIV infections that were acquired many years previously. In addition, there are significant problems associated with the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of most AIDS case-reporting systems. Routine HIV surveillance systems are being developed worldwide. Such systems must be adapted to the prevailing epidemiological situation; and the sampling methods used in populations where the prevalence of infection is very low must necessarily differ from those where it is moderate to high. Large-scale population serosurveys are very costly, and the results from such surveys may also be of limited accuracy because of serious problems of selection and participation bias. Furthermore, they may become outdated rapidly in areas where a high incidence of HIV infection occurs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2398,0.005,1.0000,"In the current study we investigated the prevalence of the TNF-α 238G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the TNF-α gene in the development of lipodystrophy among HIV-1 infected individuals who had been receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the immunodeficiency clinics of the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) at Pune, India. We assessed the association of this SNP with the development of lipoatrophy/dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in these patients and measured carotid intima thickening which is a surrogate marker for chronic cardiac morbidity. Our results show that the incidence of the TNF-α 238G/A SNP is ~ two fold higher in patients with lipodystrophy as compared to those without lipodystrophy. Patients with lipodystrophy demonstrated a higher likelihood of the development of metabolic syndrome as evident by increased insulin sensitivity and increased percentage (%) β cell function. Further, a significant increase in left carotid intima thickness was observed in patients with lipodystrophy. Our study validates the association of the TNF-α 238G/A SNP allelic variant with the development of HIV- lipodystrophy via the modulation of TNF-α production, which contributes to dyslipidemia, increased lipolysis, increased insulin resistance, altered differentiation of adipocytes and increased carotid intima thickness. The contribution of genetic determinants such as the TNF-α 238G/A SNP to lipodystrophy, may provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie this disease condition and may be useful in the future for personalized therapy. Additionally, these findings will be useful in monitoring chronic cardiac morbidities among HIV infected individuals who express this SNP. "
619,0.005,1.0000,"The introduction of enfuvirtide (FUZEON) represents an important advance in the treatment of therapy-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection. However, parenteral self-administration, and the advanced disease and antiretroviral experience of patients currently most needing enfuvirtide introduce unique usage considerations. Enfuvirtide has been shown to provide clinically relevant improvements in CD4 cell counts and reductions in HIV viraemia across all subgroups of treatment-experienced patients studied, including those taking few or no other active drugs. However, optimal outcome results from initiation when the CD4 cell count is above 100 x 10(6) cells/l and viraemia below 1 x 10(5) copies/ml, as part of a newly constructed third or fourth antiretroviral regimen in combination with one or two other antiretrovirals to which the virus remains sensitive. Resistance testing should be used where available to guide background drug selection. Where insufficient options for an effective background exist, enfuvirtide should still be considered and treatment undertaken with the aim of achieving an immunological or clinical response, despite the unlikelihood of a sustained virological outcome. Similarly, where there is no viable alternative treatment, enfuvirtide should be continued following virological failure wherever ongoing immunological or clinical benefit is discerned. Injection site reactions (ISRs) are common on enfuvirtide and will affect almost all patients. ISRs are manageable and seldom activity- or treatment-limiting. Bacterial pneumonia and systemic hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported uncommonly. A structured series of patient visits with a healthcare professional provides an atmosphere of ongoing training and support that may prevent 'injection fatigue', maintain adherence and minimise the incidence of ISRs. An initial investment in establishing such procedures can be expected to yield significant returns in patient confidence and benefit on enfuvirtide."
3684,0.005,1.0000,"There still remains several unanswered questions concerning the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Interferons (IFNs), as well as other cytokines, are both dysregulated in HIV infection and serve as effector molecules that modulate the replicative capacity of HIV. Acid-labile IFN-alpha, an aberrant form of interferon earlier described in certain autoimmune diseases, has been detected in HIV-infected individuals. Conversely, a deficient expression of IFN-alpha may occur usually associated with HIV disease. Although conflicting findings have been reported on whether IFN-gamma, a product of activated T and natural killer (NK) cells, is elevated in the peripheral blood (PB) compartment, high levels of its expression have been observed in the germinal centers of the lymph nodes during HIV disease. IFN-alpha and IFN-beta have shown potent anti-retroviral effects in several in vitro systems of both acute and chronic HIV infection. These findings have served as the basis of the rationale for their therapeutic application, resulting in some positive effects at least in those patients with relatively high CD4+ T cell counts and healthy immune functions. Furthermore, IFN-alpha has shown important therapeutic effects on HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Both suppressive and inductive effects on HIV replication in vitro have been described for IFN-gamma, whereas no clear clinical benefits have been reported following its administration to HIV-infected individuals. In conclusion, IFNs are involved in several pathogenic aspects of HIV infection and AIDS, and certain IFNs may serve as important tools to limit the spread of the virus and the progression of disease."

8273,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the compliance and tolerance with zidovudine (azidothymidine or AZT) therapy among poor, minority, and intravenous drug-using patients, data were collected on all AIDS and ARC patients followed for at least 4 weeks in a New York City Human Immunodeficiency Virus clinic. Ninety-nine patients received zidovudine, of whom 75% were males, 92% were minorities, and 59% had a history of intravenous drug use. Of the 99 patients, 72 had AIDS and 27 had ARC with T-helper (CD4) lymphocytes less than or equal to 500 mm3. Eighty-seven of the 99 patients (88%) were compliant with zidovudine therapy. Fifty-seven percent of these had at least one adverse drug reaction requiring dose reduction (44%) or cessation (13%). Adverse reactions were similar to those reported in other populations with HIV-related illness, although headache and nausea were less common. Twenty opportunistic infections (OIs) or HIV-related malignancies occurred in 15 of 82 (18%) patients who were on zidovudine for at least 4 weeks (7.6 OIs/1,000 patient weeks). Seven of the 82 died (9%), compared to 9 of the 17 patients (53%) who did not complete 4 weeks of zidovudine therapy (p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in any of these measures when intravenous drug users were compared with other risk groups. We conclude that zidovudine can be administered to intravenous drug users and others in an inner city clinic with acceptable compliance and tolerance."
3412,0.005,1.0000,"The incidence and severity of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons receiving intravenous pentamidine for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia during a 5-year period were reviewed retrospectively. Predisposing risk factors for ADRs were identified. ADRs were included if they occurred during or within 1 week following the discontinuation of pentamidine treatment. Nephrotoxicity, dysglycemia, hepatotoxicity, hyperkalemia, and hyperamylasemia accounted for 80% of ADRs (n = 174) that occurred in 76 (71.7%) of 106 patients during 84 treatment courses of pentamidine. A significant relationship between hypoglycemia and nephrotoxicity was observed (P = .002). Four factors were significantly associated with occurrence of an ADR: number of concomitant medications (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36, P = .005), nonwhite ethnicity (OR = 5.00, P = .017), cumulative dosage of pentamidine (OR = 1.03, P = .030), and concurrent use of other nephrotoxic drugs (OR = 2.34, P = .047). Two factors, daily dosage and history of intravenous drug use, approached significance. Knowledge of and avoidance of potential risk factors might allow safer use of pentamidine and reduce the prevalence of ADRs."
8913,0.005,1.0000,"To assess the prevalence of major drug resistance mutations in antiretroviral (ARV)-treated patients with detectable viral load (VL) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, genotypic resistance testing was performed among treated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) patients attending the University Malaya Medical Center between July 2003 and November 2004. The reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes from 36 plasma samples with detectable VL were examined for major mutations associated with ARV resistance as reported by the International AIDS Society-USA Drug Resistance Mutations Group. The prevalence of patients with at least one major mutation conferring drug resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), non-NRTIs (NNRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs) was 77.8%. In the RT gene, the frequency of mutations associated with NRTIs and NNRTIs resistance was 52.8 and 63.9%, respectively, with M184V and K103N mutations being selected most frequently by these drugs. A patient with Q151M mutation complex was also detected. Twenty-two percent of the patients had mutations associated with PIs. The following pattern of prevalence of ARV-resistant HIV-1 variants was observed: NNRTI-resistant > NRTI-resistant > PI-resistant. The prevalence of major drug resistance mutations among ARV-treated patients with detectable VL is high in Kuala Lumpur. Genotypic drug resistance testing is therefore important for monitoring patients experiencing ARV regimen failure."
6744,0.005,1.0000,"In order to determine the current prevalence and incidence of fluconazole-resistant oropharyngeal candidiasis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, we conducted a prospective observational study of a consecutive series of HIV-infected patients. Of 128 enrolled patients, 70 patients completed four quarterly follow-up visits over a period of 1 year. Over this period, declining rates of carriage of Candida albicans (from 61% to 39%; P = .008) and of oropharyngeal candidiasis (from 30% to 4%; P < .001) were documented. Trends toward reduction in the frequency of fluconazole-resistant isolates (MIC, > or = 64 micrograms/mL) were also seen. During the survey period, the mean (median) number of antiretroviral agents used per patient rose from 0.5 (0) to 1.8 (2) (P < .001). Thus, rather than progression, we observed declining rates of oropharyngeal candidiasis, C. albicans carriage, and fluconazole-resistant C. albicans in a cohort of HIV-infected patients treated with increasingly effective antiretroviral therapy."
8676,0.005,1.0000,"To assess the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive subjects, fecal samples were collected from 120 HIV-seropositive patients and were analyzed for various intestinal parasites. Thirty-six patients (30%) were found to harbor an intestinal parasite. Cryptosporidium parvum was the most common (10.8%), followed by Giardia lamblia (8.3%). Cyclospora cayetanensis and Blastocystis hominis each were detected in 3.3% of the patients, while Isospora belli and Enterocytozoon bieneusi were each detected in 2.5% of the patients. The other parasites observed were Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar in two cases and hookworm ova in one patient. Of the 36 patients who tested positive for intestinal parasites, 27 (75%) had diarrhea. The most common parasite, which was associated with diarrhea, was C. parvum. The present study highlights the importance of testing for intestinal parasites in patients who are HIV-positive, and emphasizes the necessity of increasing awareness among clinicians regarding the occurrence of these parasites in this population."
8668,0.005,1.0000,"To compare the seroprevalence of and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) among patients attending a public sexually transmitted disease clinic, the authors conducted both voluntary and blinded seroprevalence surveys between June 1989 and August 1990. For the voluntary survey, every twenty-fifth patient attending the clinic for a new problem was invited to receive anonymous testing for HIV antibody. For the blinded survey, sera obtained for syphilis serologies from 2,297 (86%) of the 2,682 patients attending the clinic for a new problem were tested for HIV antibody after all personal identifiers were removed. Of the 946 eligible patients, 631 (66.7%) agreed to participate in the voluntary survey. Black men were significantly less likely to participate than other men and women (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of HIV antibody was 25% greater in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey (15.2% and 11.4%, respectively, p < 0.05). This difference was due primarily to black homosexual/bisexual men, who had a 12.7-fold greater risk of HIV infection in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey. These results suggest that blinded seroprevalence surveys may provide a better prevalence estimate of HIV infection than voluntary surveys. The greater risk for HIV infection observed among homosexual and bisexual black men, who were tested only in the blinded serosurvey, suggests that efforts to increase voluntary testing for HIV infection in this group should be developed."
3916,0.005,1.0000,"Numerous African primates are infected with simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). It is now well established that the clade of SIVs infecting west-central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) represent the progenitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), whereas HIV-2 results from different cross-species transmissions of SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys). We present here the first molecular epidemiological survey of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVwrc) in wild-living western red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus badius badius) which are frequently hunted by the human population and represent a favourite prey of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). We collected faecal samples (n=88) and we assessed individual discrimination by microsatellite analyses and visual observation. We tested the inferred 53 adult individuals belonging to two neighbouring habituated groups for presence of SIVwrc infection by viral RNA (vRNA) detection. We amplified viral polymerase (pol) (650 bp) and/or envelope (env) (570 bp) sequences in 14 individuals, resulting in a minimal prevalence of 26% among the individuals sampled, possibly reaching 50% when considering the relatively low sensitivity of viral RNA detection in faecal samples. With a few exceptions, phylogenetic analysis of pol and env sequences revealed a low degree of intragroup genetic diversity and a general viral clustering related to the social group of origin. However, we found a higher intergroup diversity. Behavioural and demographic data collected previously from these communities indicate that red colobus monkeys live in promiscuous multi-male societies, where females leave their natal group at the sub-adult stage of their lives and where extra-group copulations or male immigration have been rarely observed. The phylogenetic data we obtained seem to reflect these behavioural characteristics. Overall, our results indicate that wild-living red colobus represent a substantial reservoir of SIVwrc. Moreover, because of their frequent association with other monkey species, the predation pressure exerted by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and by poachers around and inside the park, simian to simian and simian to human SIVwrc cross-species transmission cannot be excluded."
995,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 fusion inhibitor T-20 (Enfuvirtide, Fuzeon) has recently been introduced into clinical practice. T-20 in combination with HAART efficiently inhibits HIV-1 replication, however T-20 resistance has been reported and the number of confirmed resistant-associated mutations is growing. In this study we aimed to analyze HIV-1 gp41 transmembrane protein (TM) variability and primary resistance to T-20 in plasma viruses from 10 HIV-1 subtype B infected homosexuals. Nine out of ten were documented seroconverters. Nine individuals (including one long time infected therapy naïve individual) were part of four linked virus infection chains. We also examined TM polymorphism in two AIDS patients under HAART and T-20 therapy. Obtained TM amplicons were examined for minor variants by clonal analysis.Sequences polymorphism of the N-terminal regions of the fusion domain (FD) and the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain were demonstrated in examined seroconverters. Analysis of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain revealed T-20 resistance in cloned sequences from 3/10 individuals. In two individuals these mutations were present as minor viral quasispecies. Transmission of the resistant virus to the sexual partner was traced in virus infection chain.Baseline TM amplicons (population sequence) and clones from two patients under HAART did not contain T-20 resistance associated mutations. After onset of T-20 therapy only resistant viruses were identified in plasma from the patients. As shown by clonal analysis of plasma from one patient, treatment interruption results in viruses reverting to a T-20-sensitive genotype."
4563,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection alters the epidemiology of mycobacterial infections. In the industrialised world, this has led to an increase in severe illness associated with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and, in the developing world, to doubling of tuberculosis cases in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The interaction with Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs when the CD4 count is relatively high (> 200) and tuberculosis (TB) is now the commonest presenting AIDS defining disease in Africa. In international public health terms the interaction between TB and HIV infection has led to the World Health Organisation declaring TB to be a global emergency. Both TB and HIV are diseases of poverty and the key to the reduction of incidence of both diseases is the improvement of socio-economic conditions. Other control methods are case finding and treatment, chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccination. Finding active (sputum positive) case of tuberculosis and treating them is the function of TB control programmes in all countries, but poor adherence to medication has lead to low cure rates and increasing development of drug resistance. Resources are needed to improve adherence to medication and for research to improve diagnostic methods and treatment."
8329,0.005,1.0000,"The duration of HIV infection is usually unknown for most patients entering into HIV care. Data on the frequency at which resistance mutations are detected in these patients are needed to support practical guidance on the use of resistance testing in this clinical situation. Furthermore, little is known about HIV subtype diversity in much of the United States. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence of drug resistance mutations and nonsubtype B strains of HIV among antiretroviral-naïve individuals presenting for HIV care in New York State between September 2000 and January 2004. Sequences were obtained using a commercial HIV genotyping assay. Seventeen of 151 subjects (11.3%; 95% confidence interval 7.2%-17.3%) had at least one drug-resistance mutation, including 5 subjects with fewer than 200 CD4(+) T cells, indicative of advanced infection. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor resistance mutations were detected in 6.6%, 5.3%, and 0.7% of subjects, respectively. Subjects from New York City-based clinics were less likely to have resistant virus than subjects from clinics elsewhere in New York State. Nonsubtype B strains of HIV were detected in 9 (6.0%) individuals and were associated with heterosexual contact. Two nonsubtype B strains from this cohort also carried drug-resistance mutations. These data indicate that drug-resistant virus is frequently detected in antiretroviral-naïve individuals entering HIV care in New York State. Furthermore, a diverse set of nonsubtype B strains were identified and evidence suggests that nonsubtype B strains, including those carrying drug-resistance mutations, are being transmitted in New York State."
9894,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy has dramatically reduced mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In 1988, the suggestion that the first antiretroviral drug, zidovudine, was the potential cause of muscle pathology in HIV-infected persons resulted in structural and biochemical patient studies demonstrating acquired mitochondrial dysfunction. Assessment of subsequent nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) antiretroviral drugs has indicated that mitochondria are a common target of NRTI toxicity in multiple tissues, leading to a wide variety of pathology ranging from lipodystrophy to neuropathy. Overwhelmingly, these complications have emerged during post-licensing human studies. Subsequent animal and in vitro studies have then elucidated the potential pathological mechanisms, suggesting that NRTI-associated mitochondrial toxicity arises principally from inhibition of the sole mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma, leading to a reduction in mtDNA content (depletion). Millions of patients have been treated with mitochondrially toxic NRTIs and these drugs remain the backbone of antiretroviral rollout in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Here we describe the 25-year history of antiretroviral associated mitochondrial pathology and critically review the strength of evidence linking clinical, histopathological, and molecular data. We discuss recently described novel mechanisms of NRTI-associated mitochondrial damage and whether or not recently licensed NRTIs may be considered free from mitochondrial toxicity. "
7487,0.005,1.0000,"At least 10 hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes (A to J) with distinct geographic distributions and several HBV mutants, including precore/core promoter mutations and pre-S/S deletion mutations, have been recognized to be not only predictive of liver disease progression but also associated with response to antiviral therapy. HBV genotype-specific pathogenesis may contribute to heterogeneous clinical outcomes in chronic hepatitis B patients across the world. For example, patients with HBV genotypes C and D infection have a lower rate of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion. In addition, HBV genotypes C and D have a higher frequency of core promoter and pre-S mutations than genotypes A and B. Genotypes C and D also carry a higher lifetime risk of cirrhosis and HCC development than genotypes A and B. Core promoter and pre-S mutations also correlate with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therapeutically, genotypes A and B patients have a better response to interferon-based therapy than genotypes C and D patients, but the response to nucleos(t)ide analogs is comparable across different HBV genotypes. In conclusion, HBV genotypes and variants may serve as viral genetic markers to predict disease progression as well as help practicing physicians optimize individualized antiviral therapy in clinical practice.

6536,0.005,1.0000,"The prospective, multisite human immunodeficiency (HIV) Epidemiology Research Study was established to define the biologic, psychologic, and social effects of HIV infection on the health of US women. From 1993 to 1995, a total of 871 HIV-infected women and 439 demographically matched, uninfected women aged 16-55 years, half of whom reported injection drug use and half of whom reported only sexual risk behaviors, were recruited in four US cities. Two sites recruited primarily from medical/drug therapy care settings, and two recruited from community sources. Women consented to biannual interviews; physical examination; blood, urine, and cervicovaginal specimen collection and repository; laboratory assays; and abstraction of outpatient and inpatient medical records to document HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related diagnoses. Retention was greater than 88% at the third 6-month follow-up. Lower retention was associated with currently injecting drugs, not having dependent children, and not being infected with HIV at enrollment. In addition to the core study, a variety of nested studies are under way, some in collaboration with other HIV cohorts and various Public Health Service agencies. This cohort is distinct from other HIV longitudinal cohorts in the diversity of its participants and the comprehensive range of measures to study prospectively the biomedical, social, and emotional effects of the HIV epidemic on infected women and those whose behavior puts them at high risk of infection."
5531,0.005,1.0000,"Effective antiretroviral therapy initially resulted in large decreases in hospitalization rates of HIV-infected patients. The goal of this study was to determine whether these gains were being maintained in 2001. A cross-sectional study of hospital admission characteristics during four time periods was performed. All patients receiving care at the HIV clinics of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (NYPH) in New York City were included. In 1995, 883 outpatients were receiving care for HIV infection at NYPH; this increased to 1990 outpatients by 2001. Demographic and laboratory information was obtained for these outpatients, and diagnoses were recorded for all patients requiring hospitalization on at NYPH during the time periods January 1 through June 30, in 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001. The incidence of hospital admission declined in all four time periods: 1995 (95 per 100 patient-years [pt-yr]), 1997 (48 per 100 pt-yr), 1999 (38 per 100 pt-yr, p < 0.05), and 2001 (25 per 100 pt-yr). The incidence of bacterial pneumonia and opportunistic infections (OIs) decreased in all four time periods. The median hospitalization were CD4(+) cell count for outpatients increased from 231 (1995) to 364 (2001). Important predictors of hospitalization were CD4(+) < 200, and IVDU as an HIV risk factor. Since 1995 and the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, continuing increases in CD4(+) cell counts of outpatients has been reflected in persistent declines in hospitalization rates. Large decreases in OIs and pneumonia have been minimally offset by stable rates of hospital admissions for diagnoses such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and cellulitis."
343,0.005,1.0000,"Advances in antiretroviral therapy and treatment or prophylaxis against opportunistic infection have resulted in prolongation of the survival of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Previous research has demonstrated an association between AIDS and risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In addition to the approximately 3% of individuals found to have NHL at the time of AIDS onset, others continue to develop NHL following AIDS diagnosis. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute demonstrated a sharply increasing incidence of NHL among men in the age range 20-49 years since 1983 in the United States. Based on new data on the risk of NHL following AIDS diagnosis, on estimates of improved survival following AIDS diagnosis, and on projections of future AIDS incidence, we considered four sets of assumptions and estimated the number of AIDS-related NHL cases in 1992 to be between 2900 and 9800. Three of these projections were higher than the estimate of 4700 cases obtained by linear extrapolation of SEER incidence trends. These projections of AIDS-related NHL incidence suggest that between 8% and 27% of all NHL cases that occur in the United States in 1992 will arise as a consequence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), imposing a substantial health care burden. More research into the pathogenesis of lymphoma and new approaches to antiretroviral and antilymphoma therapy will be necessary to prevent and treat this formidable complication of infection with HIV."
9542,0.005,1.0000,"This study aimed to determine the effect of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection on peripheral levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-18 and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor type II (sTNFRII). Serum levels were monitored for a 1-year period in 25 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) who were naive for HAART at the initiation of the study, and in four HIV-1-infected long-term non-progressors. Serum levels of both IL-18 and sTNFRII at baseline were significantly higher in HIV-1-infected patients than in controls. Baseline levels of IL-18 and sTNFRII were not significantly different in long-term non-progressors compared with the other patients. HCV co-infected patients had significantly higher levels of IL-18 and sTNFRII at each time-point compared with patients who were not co-infected with HCV. Irrespective of HCV status, response to HAART resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of both IL-18 and sTNFRII, particularly among patients who achieved HIV viral suppression, but the net decrease observed at the end of follow-up was lower in patients co-infected with HCV. No information was obtained from IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12 (p70) measurements. The data suggest that analysis of serum levels of IL-18 and sTNFRII may be a valuable tool for evaluating the response to HAART, and perhaps for assessing the degree of immune restoration achieved by HAART responders. The results also highlight the relevance of considering the HCV infection status of HIV-1-infected patients in order to avoid misinterpretation of IL-18 and sTNFRII measurements."
1511,0.005,1.0000,"With the increasing availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy, vertically infected children have a better chance of surviving into adolescence and adulthood. Additionally, sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a problem, and incidence and prevalence among youth remain high. Therefore, HIV-infected adolescents are becoming a more prominent sub-group in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Experience from the developed world indicates that providing effective care and treatment for adolescents poses unique challenges. This study aimed to identify the experiences and needs of adolescents growing up in care or on treatment for HIV in Cape Town, South Africa. Four focus groups interviews were conducted with a total of 26 young people attending an adolescent infectious diseases clinic at a tertiary hospital. Questions explored participant's perceptions on their present and future lives, and their self-identified needs. Focus groups revealed that adolescents viewed their illness negatively, but that social issues such as violence and poverty were also concerns. Despite these stressors, most respondents remained positive about the present and future, and wanted support for achieving their goals. As increasing numbers of HIV-infected children enter adolescence, healthcare providers and communities must find ways to support these young people to transition into adulthood."
4455,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemic of clinically apparent human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) infection in Nicaragua and to discuss the reasons why the number of HIV patients presenting to the public health care system is increasing compared with other Central American countries. From 1987 to 2004, 1,614 HIV-positive patients were officially reported to the Nicaraguan STI/HIV/AIDS national program. Urban areas along the west-central and eastern part of Nicaragua showed the highest prevalence of AIDS, with a maximum of 54.2/year per 100,000 inhabitants. Most of the infections (91%) were acquired sexually: 65% by heterosexual contacts and 26% by homosexual contacts. The highest rate of infection was found in men aged between 20 to 39 years, with a peak around 35 to 39 years (annual incidence of 125.6 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants), and in women aged 20 to 34 years old, with a peak around 20 to 24 years (annual incidence 46.6 per 100,000 inhabitants). The male to female ratio of infection was 3:1. The death rate was stable until the beginning of 1999, but increased sharply thereafter up to 2004, the year that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced in Nicaragua. In 2005, we observed a further increase in the mortality. However, our data do not represent the magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a whole, due to a lack of systemic surveillance. HIV/AIDS in Nicaragua is in a nascent stage and is concentrated in high-risk populations, such as utility workers, commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, prisoners, street children, housewives and police and military forces. Education of the population is an urgent need to increase HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, change attitudes, and increase safer sex practice in the community."
3532,0.005,1.0000,"The purposes of this study were to determine the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in dual hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) endemic areas and to assess the associated risk factors of HCC development in the community. During April 2004 to November 2005, 4,127 residents of Tainan County, aged 40 years or older, had participated in a comprehensive health examination. Among them, residents with HBV or HCV infection; platelet count less than or equal to 150×10(9)/L; and no hepatic tumor, by liver ultrasonography, were invited to this study. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) screening and ultrasonography for HCC surveillance were performed. Once hepatic tumor was detected, the subjects were referred to medical centers for further confirmation and treatment. A total of 1,133 residents were eligible for this study, and 413 (36.5%), including 197 men and 216 women, with a mean age of 64.5 years, were enrolled. There were 21 cases with suspected HCC. Of the 21 cases, 18 (85.7%) accepted further studies and 11 (52.4%) were confirmed to be affected with HCC. All HCCs were unifocal with a diameter less than or equal to 4 cm. In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the 2-year cumulative incidence of HCC was 4.7%. Based on the same analysis with log rank test, AFP greater than or equal to 20 ng/mL (p=0.007), platelet count less than or equal to 100×10(9)/L (p<0.001), and liver cirrhosis (p<0.001) were found to be the associated risk factors of HCC development. In summary, the 2-year cumulative incidence of HCC was 4.7% among adult residents with chronic HBV or HCV infection in this dual HBV and HCV endemic area. Platelet count less than 100×10(9)/L, AFP level greater than 20 ng/mL, and liver cirrhosis were the associated risk factors for HCC development."
4371,0.005,1.0000,"Different effective treatments, which are today available for chronic virus hepatitis C and B, reduce the rate of adverse outcomes but HCV and HBV infections are still one of the major health and public medical problems. Screening for HCV and HBV is performed only in high-risk groups with diagnostic tests with high sensitivity and specificity. In HCV antibody positive patients, serum HCV RNA has to be determined by quantitative assay and virus genotype identified. Liver fibrosis is determined by liver biopsy or widely accepted elastography and different serum fibrosis markers. In patients with HCV cirrhosis, HCC has to be detected by expert ultrasound performer or MSCT, MR, and liver transplantation performed according to indications. The current hepatitis B vaccination policy is universal neonatal vaccination. The risk population undergo screening for HBsAg, antiHBc and antiHBs antibodies. The HBsAg, HBeAg and antiHBe positive individuals undergo quantitative testing for HBsAg and HBV DNA. According to the stage of their liver disease, patients are treated with interferon or nucleos(t)ide analogues. The optimal treatment with oral antivirals are entecavir and tenofovir, but the duration of treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues is generally life-long. In HBV cirrhosis and HBsAg inactive carriers, detection of HCC is essential, and liver transplantation is successfully performed in these patients."
8236,0.005,1.0000,"The Asia-Pacific region has disparate hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemiology, with prevalence ranging from 0·1% to 4·7%, and a unique genotype distribution. Genotype 1b dominates in east Asia, whereas in south Asia and southeast Asia genotype 3 dominates, and in Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos), genotype 6 is most common. Often, availability of all-oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) is delayed because of differing regulatory requirements. Ideally, for genotype 1 infections, sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir, sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir, or ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus dasabuvir are suitable. Asunaprevir plus daclatasvir is appropriate for compensated genotype 1b HCV if baseline NS5A mutations are absent. For genotype 3 infections, sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir for 24 weeks or sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, and ribavirin for 12 weeks are the optimal oral therapies, particularly for patients with cirrhosis and those who are treatment experienced, whereas sofosbuvir, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin for 12 weeks is an alternative regimen. For genotype 6, sofosbuvir plus pegylated interferon and ribavirin, sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir, or sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks are all suitable. Pegylated interferon plus ribavirin has been replaced by sofosbuvir plus pegylated interferon and ribavirin, and all-oral therapies where available, but cost and affordability remain a major issue because of the absence of universal health coverage. Few patients have been treated because of multiple barriers to accessing care. HCV in the Asia-Pacific region is challenging because of the disparate epidemiology, poor access to all-oral therapy because of availability, cost, or regulatory licensing. Until these problems are addressed, the burden of disease is likely to remain high."
7090,0.005,1.0000,"Raltegravir, as the first HIV integrase inhibitor, has been used and prospectively monitored since 2010 in our HIV outpatient centre, where over 1,200 patients are monitored. The aim of our report is to perform an interim assessment of the background, the safety profile and the clinical-laboratory monitoring of all patients treated with a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including raltegravir, for at least 12 months. In all, 109 pretreated patients started a raltegravir-containing cART when aged 44.8 plus or minus 19.2 years, with a history of HIV infection lasting 13.4 plus or minus 9.7 years. All subjects were monitored for at least 12 months (mean 17.2 plus or minus 10.3 months). In the vast majority of cases (93 of 109: 85.3%), multiple (3-16) prior cART changes prompted raltegravir introduction in advanced-salvage lines: 72 of 109 (66.1%) patients had even developed a concurrent triple-class resistance to anti-HIV compounds. The most frequent companion antiretroviral agents were: darunavir/ritonavir (75 cases), maraviroc (47 subjects), and etravirine (38 cases). The most common underlying conditions were: AIDS (46 patients), liver cirrhosis (31 cases), AIDS-related or other malignancies (23 cases), and major cardio-cerebro-vascular events (18 cases). A chronic HCV and HBV hepatitis were of concern in 48 and 23 patients, respectively. The adjunct of raltegravir favourably affected all clinical-laboratory markers of HIV disease progression, and those of the broad spectrum of comorbidities, except for two patients who failed the raltegravir-containing cART due to insufficient adherence. Despite the already compromised clinical situation, a minority of subjects experienced mild-transient clinical-laboratory untoward events possibly attributable to raltegravir, such that no patients discontinued raltegravir during the observation period. Only three AIDS-defining conditions became apparent during raltegravir-based cART; chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy cycles were performed as scheduled in patients suffering from cancer; chronic hepatitis B and C progressed to liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocarcinoma in only 2 and 6 patients. Otherwise, treatment with pegylated interferon-ribavirin became feasible in 25 patients of 48 with chronic HCV. During raltegravir-containing cART, neither autoimmune disorders nor novel malignancies were diagnosed. Only mild-transient gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue, dizziness, insomnia and cutaneous rash were reported, although their relationship with the study drug was difficult to assess due to multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. Abnormal liver function testings were observed in 57 patients (52.3%), all suffering from concurrent hepato-biliary disorders. Significant increases in serum lipids and/or lipase levels versus baseline values were never registered: serum lipid levels significantly improved after raltegravir introduction. Our experience with raltegravir underlines its excellent efficacy and safety profile, which exploits a novel mechanism of action, and displays no cross-resistance with any other antiretroviral. A progressively extended prescription in naive patients and early cART lines will allow the therapeutic potential of raltegravir to be exploited. "
9295,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus may reactivate in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with direct-acting antivirals. The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in HBV + hepatitis C virus (HCV)-co-infected patients with compensated liver cirrhosis treated with paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir, dasabuvir with ribavirin. We reviewed prospectively gathered data from a national cohort of 2070 hepatitis C virus patients with compensated liver cirrhosis who received reimbursed paritaprevir/ombitasvir/r, dasabuvir with ribavirin for 12 weeks from the Romanian National Health Agency during 2015-2016. Twenty-five patients in this cohort were HBs antigen positive (1.2%); 15 untreated with nucleotide analogues agreed to enter the study. These patients were followed up: ALT monthly, serology for HBV and DNA viral load at baseline, EOT and SVR at 12 weeks. Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-co-infected patients were all genotype 1b and 52% females, with a median age of 60 years (51 ÷ 74); 76% were pretreated with peginterferon + ribavirin; 72% were with severe necroinflammatory activity on FibroMax assessment; 40% presented comorbidities; and all were HBe antigen negative. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) SVR response rate was 100%. Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA viral load was undetectable in 7/15 (47%) before therapy, and for the other 8 patients, it varied between below 20 and 867 IU/mL. Five patients (33%) presented virological reactivation (>2 log increase in HBV-DNA levels) during therapy. One patient presented with hepatitis associated with HBV reactivation, and two started anti-HBV therapy with entecavir. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) virological reactivation was present in 33% in our patients. Generally, HBV-DNA elevations were mild (<20 000 IU/mL); however, we report one case of hepatitis associated with HBV reactivation."
8419,0.005,1.0000,"We present a case report of a Japanese patient who showed prolonged infection after acute hepatitis B with genotype H. The patient was a 60-year-old man who underwent an annual health care check every year for several years and was never pointed out to have any liver damage, and markers for hepatitis B and C were negative. He was found to be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at his health care check in December 2005. After one month, he had an elevated aminotransferase level with hepatitis B e antigen and a high level of serum HBV DNA. He was diagnosed as having acute hepatitis B. On HBV genotype, he had genotype H by the direct sequence method, and he was given a 100 mg of lamivudine daily. However, his acute hepatitis tended to go toward prolonged infection. After two months, he was treated with interferon daily for 28 days. He had negative HBsAg in August 2006. Genotype H, the newest type of hepatitis B, could be the type which shows a poor response to lamivudine. The present paper is the first report, describing the clinical course of acute hepatitis B with genotype H from onset to remission."
2747,0.005,1.0000,"Virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which kill virus-infected cells, are thought to be a major host defense against viral infections. The addition of interleukin 7 (IL-7) at the onset of mitogen-stimulated cultures resulted in a marked (up to threefold) augmentation of env-specific cytotoxicity in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals (p < 0.001). Addition of IL-7 on day 3 or 5 produced a significant but lesser augmentation of CTL response as compared to day 0. The IL-7-induced proliferative response and augmentation of cytotoxic activity was time and dose dependent, with an optimal IL-7 concentration of 1000 U/ml. Cell surface phenotypic analysis of CTL effector cells indicates that IL-7 primarily affects the proliferation of CD8+ T cells. Anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibody (MAb) substantially inhibited the proliferative effect of IL-2, but did not affect the proliferative effect of IL-7. Endogenous IL-2-induced generation of cytotoxic T cells was blocked by MAbs to IL-2 or IL-2R. The addition of IL-7 restored the process of conversion of precursor CTLs (pCTLs) to mature CTLs (mCTLs) and significantly enhanced specific cytolytic activity. It appears that IL-7 is a potent regulatory cytokine capable of acting independently of IL-2 in mitogen-specific activation of pCTLs to mCTLs. These data suggest that IL-7 should be considered as a potential therapeutic approach in AIDS and other infectious diseases in which CTL response declines."
8711,0.005,1.0000,"Using virions harvested from 293T cells stably expressing either low or high levels of surface ICAM-1, we determined that the number of virus-embedded host ICAM-1 proteins is positively influenced by the expression level of ICAM-1 on virus producer cells. Moreover, the increase in virion-bound host cell membrane ICAM-1 led to a concomitant enhancement of virus infectivity when a T-cell-tropic strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was used. The phenomenon was also seen when primary human cells were infected with virions pseudotyped with the envelope protein from a macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolate, thus ruling out any envelope-specific effect. We also observed that target cells treated with NKI-L16, an anti-LFA-1 antibody known to increase the affinity of LFA-1 for ICAM-1, were markedly more susceptible to infection with HIV-1 particles bearing on their surfaces large numbers of host-derived ICAM-1 proteins. Given that cellular activation of leukocytes is known to modify the conformational state of LFA-1 and induce ICAM-1 surface expression, it is tempting to speculate that activation of virus-infected cells will lead to the production of HIV-1 particles bearing more host ICAM-1 on their surfaces and that such progeny virions will preferentially infect and replicate more efficiently in activated cells which are prevalent in lymphoid organs."
1503,0.005,1.0000,"While CD4 and several chemokine receptors are the principal receptors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viruses, other cell membrane proteins also play a role in HIV-1 infection. A large array of host cell-derived membrane proteins, including adhesion molecules, are incorporated into the envelope of HIV-1 virions, and the profile of host cell proteins acquired by the virus depends on the cells used to propagate the virus. The major leukocyte adhesion molecules, such as leukocyte-function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and CD44, retain their biological functions when expressed on the virion surface, and have been shown to increase virus-cell interaction, enhance virus infectivity, and extend the host cell range of the virus. LFA-1 and its ICAM ligands are also necessary for syncytium formation and cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1. Furthermore, several studies demonstrate that the presence and level of cell-derived adhesion molecules on the surface of HIV-1 virions affect the process by which antibody-mediated virus neutralization occurs and is measured: the level of virus neutralization is influenced by the host cell-derived adhesion molecules present on the virus, and thus, by the type of host cells in which the virus was produced. Adhesion molecules expressed on the target cells used in neutralization assays similarly affect HIV-1 neutralization by virus-specific antibodies. Consistent with these observations is the finding that neutralizing activities of both HIV+ plasma and human anti-gp120 monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) are enhanced by an anti-LFA-1 Mab capable of blocking LFA-1 functions. Hence, LFA-1, ICAM-1, and other cellular adhesion molecules are involved in different stages of HIV-1 infection and profoundly affect HIV-1 neutralization by virus-specific antibodies. These findings illuminate the biology of virus-cell interactions and have significant implications for evaluating candidate HIV vaccines."
1105,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 2 infection is associated with a better clinical outcome, slower rates of CD4 T cell decline, and lower viremia than is HIV-1. This study compares HIV-1 and HIV-2 in regard to the percentages of interleukin (IL)-2-, interferon (IFN)-gamma-, and IL-4-producing cells at the single-cell level, as determined by flow cytometry. At a given degree of CD4 T cell depletion, the frequency of T cells able to produce IL-2 is better preserved in HIV-2 than in HIV-1 infection, particularly within the CD4 T cell subset. As described for HIV-1 immunodeficiency, HIV-2-positive patients exhibit a marked expansion of terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells (CD28(-)CD27(-)IFN-gamma(+)). However, the proportion of CD8 T cells able to simultaneously produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma is higher in HIV-2 disease. Considering the central role of IL-2 as a lymphocyte proliferative and survival factor, these findings provide a possible immunologic basis for the distinct course of HIV-2 immunodeficiency."
9492,0.005,1.0000,"In 32 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women, routine gynecologic examination was performed with colposcopy and Papanicolaou smear; cervical swabs were collected for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA screening and typing; and immune status was assessed by CD4 T-cell count. Dot blot analysis was specifically chosen for HPV DNA screening to detect only relatively substantial HPV DNA infections. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was used for precise DNA typing of dot blot-positive samples. The HPV data were assessed for immune status; a subject with a CD4 T-cell count below 200/microL was considered functionally immunosuppressed. The frequency of dot blot positivity was fivefold higher among immunocompromised (nine of ten) than relatively immunocompetent (four of 22) HIV-infected women. Moreover, four immunosuppressed women, compared with no immunocompetent subjects, had evidence of HPV DNA without signs of HPV-associated lesions by cytology or histology (ie, latent HPV infection). Furthermore, four of nine of the immunocompromised, compared with four of 21 immunocompetent, subjects had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. These frequencies are high compared with those reported in the general population. Finally, HPV 18 was detected in five of the ten women with CD4 T-cell counts below 200/microL and in only one of the 22 with CD4 T-cell counts above that level. These results suggest that the normal immune system suppresses latent and clinical HPV cervical infections and that the efficiency of suppression may be HPV type-specific. Furthermore, impaired immune status, as reflected by CD4 T-cell count, is an important factor increasing the severity of HPV-induced cervical infections in this population."
4885,0.005,1.0000,"The safety and efficacy of a once-daily regimen that combines emtricitabine, didanosine, and efavirenz was studied among 40 previously untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The median plasma HIV RNA level was 4.77 log(10) copies/mL at baseline and decreased by a median of 3.5 log(10) copies/mL at 24 weeks, with 98% and 93% of patients achieving plasma HIV RNA levels <400 and <50 copies/mL, respectively. The median CD4 cell count was 373 cells/microL at baseline and increased by a median of 159 cells/microL at week 24. The most common treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate central nervous system symptoms (73% of patients), diarrhea (33%), rashes (10%), and biochemical abnormalities. Adverse reactions led to permanent drug discontinuation in only 1 patient. The once-daily combination therapy of emtricitabine, didanosine, and efavirenz was safe and demonstrated strong antiviral and immunologic effects that lasted for the 24-week period of the study."
3128,0.005,1.0000,"Integrase inhibitor (INI) is a novel antiretroviral drug recommended for both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients. Limited data are available on INI resistance in Thailand, where HIV-1 subtype A/E predominates. We aimed to investigate INI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) among treatment-naive patients and patients who experienced treatment failure with NNRTI-based or PI-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Thailand. One hundred and eight plasma samples of 58 treatment-naive and 50 treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected individuals were collected. The HIV-1 integrase coding region was sequenced. Polymorphisms were compared between subtype A/E and B circulating in Thailand and between treatment-naive and treatment-experienced groups. Resulting amino acids were interpreted for drug resistance according to Stanford algorithms. Ninety-seven samples were HIV-1 subtype A/E, 10 were subtype B, and one was subtype C. Age, gender, and CD4 cell counts were similar between treatment-naive and treatment-experienced groups, while the treatment-failure group showed a statistically significant longer awareness time of HIV-1 infection and lower viral load than the treatment-naive group. Major INI-RAM was not found in this study, but some minor INI-RAMs, such asV54I, L68I, L74M, T97A, and S230N, were found. Comparing INI-RAMs between subtype A/E and B, the prevalence of V54I and V72I was higher in subtype B than subtype E, while V201I was found in all sequences of subtype A/E. In subtype A/E, integrase polymorphisms were not different between treatment-naive and treatment-experienced groups. However, the number of amino acid substitutions was significantly higher in the treatment-experienced group (p=0.009). One NNRTI-based ART-treated patient was found to have potential low-level INI-RAMs. INI-RAMs are rare in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients in Thailand. This suggested that INI should be active in patients who are naive to INI in Thailand."
694,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 infection is characterized by loss of CD4T cells, leading to immunodeficiency. Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) results in suppression of the viral load and increased CD4 counts. Both viral and host factors determine CD4 cell responses to ART with approximately 15-30% of individuals having suboptimal increase of CD4T cell count, most commonly due to lack of compliance to ART. A smaller fraction of patients will have immune reconstitution failure and suboptimal CD4 increase despite suppression of HIV replication, and these individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. We sought to characterize the factors associated with decreased immunological response among Manitoba's HIV patient population. This retrospective case-control study included HIV patients with immune reconstitution failure despite suppression of HIV replication by ART. The immune reconstitution failure was defined by CD4 cell count increase from baseline of less than 100 CD4 cells/mm"
6451,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the dynamics of the K103N mutation following the withdrawal of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), we selected the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected patients with the mutation at the time or after the failure of an NNRTI-containing regimen from an observational database. Of 62 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 39 continued antiretroviral treatment without NNRTIs (group A), whereas 23 discontinued all antiretrovirals after NNRTI failure (group B). A total of 149 tests were analysed, with a median (IQR) of two (2-3) tests/patient. The overgrowth of wild-type virus at position 103 was observed in 14 subjects in group A (36%) and nine in group B (39%). No significant trend was found in relation to the disappearance of K103N variants in either group, but patients tested while receiving antiretrovirals had a significantly higher probability of retaining the K103N mutation over 24 months than those tested during treatment interruption (P = 0.007). In conclusion, following NNRTI discontinuation, HIV variants carrying the K103N mutation are not overgrown for long by wild-type quasispecies at this position in the majority of patients, although treatment interruption favours their disappearance. This suggests that the K103N mutation per se has little impact on viral fitness in vivo."
3931,0.005,1.0000,"CD4+ T cell responses are associated with disease control in chronic viral infections. We analyzed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific responses in ten aviremic and eight viremic patients treated during primary HIV-1 infection and for up to 6 yr thereafter. Using a highly sensitive 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate-succinimidyl ester-based proliferation assay, we observed that proliferative Gag and Nef peptide-specific CD4+ T cell responses were 30-fold higher in the aviremic patients. Two subsets of HIV-specific memory CD4+ T cells were identified in aviremic patients, CD45RA- CCR7+ central memory cells (Tcm) producing exclusively interleukin (IL)-2, and CD45RA- CCR7- effector memory cells (Tem) that produced both IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma. In contrast, in viremic, therapy-failing patients, we found significant frequencies of Tem that unexpectedly produced exclusively IFN-gamma. Longitudinal analysis of HIV epitope-specific CD4+ T cells revealed that only cells that had the capacity to produce IL-2 persisted as long-term memory cells. In viremic patients the presence of IFN-gamma-producing cells was restricted to periods of elevated viremia. These findings suggest that long-term CD4+ T cell memory depends on IL-2-producing CD4+ T cells and that IFN-gamma only-producing cells are short lived. Our data favor a model whereby competent HIV-specific Tcm continuously arise in small numbers but under persistent antigenemia are rapidly induced to differentiate into IFN-gamma only-producing cells that lack self-renewal capacity."
4372,0.005,1.0000,"The routes of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus transmission are quite similar and coexistence of both viruses in one patient is not a rare phenomenon. Until now, the natural course of liver diseases induced by coinfections has not been well documented and the mechanisms of interaction between the two viruses and the human host have not been fully clarified. We report the case of a patient suffering from chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus who developed an acute hepatitis B virus superinfection. Serum hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid became undetectable by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction at diagnosis of acute hepatitis B virus infection. At the same time, there was a striking increase in the serum concentrations of the antibodies against C22 and C33c hepatitis C virus antigens. Four months after clinical resolution of the acute hepatitis, hepatitis B surface antigen was undetectable in serum and three months later antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen appeared. Two years after acute hepatitis B virus infection, the patient has had no relapse of markers for viral replication of hepatitis B virus. Transaminases are within the reference range and hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid is undetectable in both serum and liver tissue. We hypothesize that acute hepatitis B virus infection stimulated a specific humoral response against hepatitis C virus as well as triggering non-specific defense mechanisms which finally eliminated both viruses."
1330,0.005,1.0000,"Tenofovir is a nucleotide acting both as an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency (HIV) reverse transcriptase and as a competitor for hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA-directed DNA polymerase. Approved worldwide in 2001, tenofovir is used as a component of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients with HIV infection. Since 2008, it has also been indicated for treatment of chronic HBV infection or HIV/HBV co-infection. The aim of the treatment consists in suppressing viral replication, thus reducing hepatic complications and improving patient survival. Furthermore, tenofovir could represent an effective therapeutic option in lamivudine-resistant HBV patients. Tenofovir is eliminated unchanged through urine via glomerular filtration (80%) and proximal tubular secretion (20%). Thus, alterations in renal clearance may interfere with tenofovir pharmacokinetics and systemic drug concentrations, modifying the therapeutic response. Hence, a renal overload of tenofovir in patients with a pre-existing kidney impairment could result in a worsening of renal function. Following a brief introduction on HBV infection and its therapeutic options, we review the latest evidence, to our knowledge, on renal toxicity of tenofovir in HBV patients and on drug management."
5554,0.005,1.0000,"Lamivudine inhibits replication of both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is commonly used as part of antiretroviral therapy. The main limitation in the use of lamivudine is resistant mutation selection. Most of these mutations affect the YMDD motif of the HBV DNA polymerase. The resistance occurs through M550V or M550I aminoacid replacements. The M550V variation may be accompanied by L526M mutation, notably in HIV-HBV co-infected patients. The aim of this study was to investigate mutations associated with lamivudine resistance in a hemodialysis patient chronically co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, who was submitted to several antiretroviral treatments."
762,0.005,1.0000,"Eleven (50%) of 22 HIV-seropositive patients suffering from congenital coagulation defects and followed at the Hemophilia Center of Padua met the eligibility criteria for zidovudine (AZT) therapy. A 3-year clinical and laboratory follow up is described. Mean length of AZT treatment was 14.3 +/- 11 months. Three patients were enrolled at the latest stages (CDC stage IV) of HIV disease. They showed no clinical improvement after AZT administration and died with AIDS. One CDC stage III patient died from a high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) which suddenly developed 3 months after starting AZT. Seven patients began antiretroviral treatment when they were mild or asymptomatic for HIV infection (CDC stage II and III). None developed any sign of HIV disease progression on the basis of CDC criteria. Moreover, AZT administration induced an improvement of the humoral markers related to HIV disease, as CD4 T-lymphocyte count, serum beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) and, although only for few months, neopterin (Np) levels. A mild thrombocytopenia due to HIV infection was detected in 5 patients. In all cases AZT treatment was effective in increasing and/or normalizing the platelet count. Reduced daily dose AZT (600-500 mg/day) appeared to be well tolerated and of minimal toxicity as compared to the higher dose (1200 mg/day). In our study, the zidovudine-induced bone marrow suppression, namely severe anemia or pancytopenia, was the major side-effect limiting tolerance of the higher dose AZT."

A 56-year-old HIV-infected man was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of severe, progressive weakness. His HIV infection was well controlled by antiretroviral therapy; other medical problems included hepatitis C and chronic renal insufficiency. About 2 weeks before presentation, the patient had received an influenza vaccination, which was followed by a generalized viral syndrome of several days' duration. Next, weakness developed and culminated in an inability to walk; this prompted the patient's presentation at the hospital. Urine chemistry, electrolyte panel, and clinical presentation were consistent with Fanconi syndrome, a generalized proximal tubular dysfunction involving proteins, glucose, uric acid, and electrolytes. Along with our Case Report, we review 25 cases of Fanconi syndrome previously reported in the literature."
199,0.005,1.0000,"The term 'genotyping' describes the genetic characterization of a genome. The genotype analysis is performed to identify mutations that differentiate one individual or strain from another. The mutations may confer resistance to specific antiviral drugs or they may simply allow classification of a strain as to 'type' and 'subtype'. There are four human viruses for which genotype information is clinically useful. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are being treated with antiretroviral drugs and resistance after prolonged treatment is common. Since HBV cannot be cultured, the only method of detecting resistance-conferring mutations in the genome is a genotypic analysis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be cured by treatment with the combination of interferon and ribavirin but certain strains of virus are more resistant to treatment than others. The current recommendations are that all HCV type 1 infections be treated for 12 months whereas other types may be successfully treated in 6 months. Since interferon treatment may have significant side effects, the determination of HCV genotype is an important aspect of this therapeutic regimen. Treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease with nucleoside analogues occasionally results in resistant virus with mutations in the phosphotransferase gene (UL97) and/or the DNA polymerase gene (UL54) that can be tested with phenotypic or genotypic assays. Since CMV grows very slowly, it may be more clinically useful to perform a rapid genotypic assay although only the UL97 gene can be efficiently genotyped. Finally, the virus for which genotyping has become the standard of care, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can now be genotyped routinely by many clinical virology labs experienced with molecular amplification methods and automated DNA sequencing technology. All currently-available antiretroviral drugs are directed against either the protease or reverse transcriptase genes of HIV-1 and the mutations within these genes that confer resistance have been well described. Sequence-based genotyping methods are not necessarily the best approach for routine genotyping of these four viruses, but sequencing is the gold standard from which other methods are developed and against which they are compared."
1896,0.005,1.0000,"Protease inhibitor-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (PI-HAART) has been implicated in dyslipidemia, peripheral insulin resistance, and abnormal adipose tissue deposition in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. In vitro evidence indicates that some PIs reduce adipocyte lipoprotein (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) expression and activities. We examined whether LPL and HL activities are reduced in HIV-infected patients with dyslipidemia. Fasting serum lipids, glucoregulatory hormones, and postheparin LPL and HL activities, as well as whole body and regional adiposity, were measured in 19 HIV-seronegative controls, 9 HIV+ patients naive to all anti-HIV medications, 9 HIV+ patients naive to PIs, 9 HIV+ patients with prior PI experience but not currently receiving PIs, and 47 HIV+ patients receiving PI-HAART. The PI-HAART group had low LPL and HL activities. However, multiple linear regression analysis indicated that low postheparin LPL activity contributed only partially to HIV-dyslipidemia. Central adiposity and high C-peptide levels (an indicator of high insulin secretion) were stronger predictors of HIV-dyslipidemia. Low LPL and HL activities, by themselves, were insufficient to explain HIV-dyslipidemia because the PI-naive group had low LPL and HL activities but had normal adiposity, C-peptide levels, and serum lipid and lipoprotein levels. HDL-cholesterol was lower in PI-HAART and PI-naive groups than seronegative controls and was directly associated with LPL activity. These findings suggest that HIV-dyslipidemia is mediated primarily by factors that influence triglyceride and lipoprotein synthesis (e.g., central adiposity and hyperinsulinemia) and mediated only partially by factors that influence triglyceride clearance (e.g., lipase activity)."
10007,0.005,1.0000,"The beneficial effects of Bifidobacteria on health have been widely accepted. Patients with chronic liver disease have varying degrees of intestinal microflora imbalance with a decrease of total Bifidobacterial counts. Since different properties have been attributed to different Bifidobacterium species and there is no information available for the detailed changes in the genus Bifidobacterium in patients with chronic liver disease heretofore, it is meaningful to investigate the structure of this bacterium at the species level in these patients. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition of intestinal Bifidobacterium in patients with hepatitis B virus-induced chronic liver disease. Nested-PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), clone library, and real-time quantitative PCR were performed on the fecal samples of 16 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB patients), 16 patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis (HBV cirrhotics), and 15 healthy subjects (Controls). Though there was no significant difference in the diversity among the three groups (P = 0.196), Bifidobacterium dentium seems to be specifically enhanced in patients as the PCR-DGGE profiles showed, which was further validated by clone library and real-time quantitative PCR. In contrast to the B. dentium, Bifidobacterium                         catenulatum/Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum were detected less frequently in the predominant profile and by quantitative PCR in HBV cirrhotics than in the controls, and the level of this species was also significantly different between these two groups (P = 0.023). Although having no quantitative difference among the three groups, Bifidobacterium longum was less commonly detected in HBV cirrhotics than in CHB patients and Controls by quantitative PCR (P = 0.011). Thus, the composition of intestinal Bifidobacterium was deeply altered in CHB and HBV cirrhotic patients with a shift from beneficial species to opportunistic pathogens. The results provide further insights into the dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in patients with hepatitis B virus-induced chronic liver disease and might potentially serve as guidance for the probiotics interventions of these diseases."
4386,0.005,1.0000,"Implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has deeply changed the landscape of HIV-associated malignancies. Some AIDS-defining tumors, namely Primitive Lymphoma of Central Nervous System, have drastically declined, whereas a steady increase has been observed for non-AIDS-defining tumors, maybe due to longer survival of HIV-infected people. Easier immune restoration, subsequent to availability of a number of drugs targeting HIV at different points, has decreased opportunistic infections which hampered treatment of HIV-associated cancers. As a matter of fact these patients have been assimilated more and more with their negative counterpart, undergoing the same aggressive approach. Consistently, procedures that have been so far precluded to HIV+ subjects, such as transplant of hemopoietic stem cells, either autologous or allogenic, and liver transplant are expected to be performed more and more extensively in this population. Which also would mean a full removal of the stigma which has weighed on it. Hence, it is true-like that malignancies and related problems may in the next future make up a main concern for the HIV specialist. Old and new challenges might be the drug-drug interaction of antiretrovirals or biotherapy-related infections or the debated question of an earlier HAART implementation in the course of HIV disease, with CD4+ cells > 500/μl. In fact, if assimilation of HIV patients with cancer and the general population is a remarkable achieved goal, uniqueness of HIV infection in terms of immune status still makes HIV-associated cancer a unique chapter in the setting of Oncology."
8717,0.005,1.0000,"HCV exists within its host as pools of related genetic variants referred to as quasispecies. The hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of the E2 envelope gene is subjected to strong selective pressure from neutralizing antibodies. The genetic complexity of this region is defined as the total number of genetic variants within the quasispecies population. The genetic complexity of the HVR1 region was examined in patients with chronic hepatitis C and its relationship with the epidemiology of HCV infection, and its influence on liver disease and the response to interferon treatment were determined in 114 patients with chronic hepatitis C. The genetic complexity of the HVR1 major variants was measured before treatment by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique, and was compared with epidemiological, clinical, virological and histological features. The patients were treated with 3 megaunits of interferon (IFN) alfa for 3 to 6 months and the response to treatment was assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months. The HVR1 could be studied in 101 of the 114 patients (89%). Genetic complexity was significantly higher in patients infected through blood transfusion than intravenous drug use (mean complexity index: 5.7 +/- 2.3 vs. 4.7 +/- 1.5, respectively; P = 0.04). This relationship was independent of age and the estimated time since infection. No significant relationship was found with other parameters of infection or liver disease. In univariate analysis, the genetic complexity of HVR1 major variants did not affect the rates of ALT normalization at months 3 and 6 of IFN treatment. HVR1 genetic complexity was lower in patients with a sustained virological response than in non-responders (4.0 +/- 1.7 vs. 5.4 +/- 2.0, respectively; P = 0.07). In multivariate analysis of pretreatment parameters associated with a sustained virological response to treatment, three parameters appeared to be independent predictors of such a response: a low viral load (P < 0.04), a low anti-HCV core IgM titer (P = 0.03) and a low genetic complexity of HVR1 major variants (P < 0.04). In conclusion, the HVR1 of HCV has a quasispecies distribution in infected individuals. Its genetic complexity is significantly higher in transfusion recipients than in intravenous drug users, suggesting that the size of the initial inoculum affects the later emergence and development of viral quasispecies. The genetic complexity of HVR1, together with viral load and the anti-HCV IgM titer, are independent predictors of a sustained virological response to IFN alfa in patients with chronic hepatitis."
7151,0.005,1.0000,"Existing data on the feasibility of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing and counseling (HTC) and linkage to care among men who have sex with men (MSM) in hotspots are currently limited. A prospective study on active targeted HTC and linkage to care among MSM (≥18 years old) was conducted at a gay sauna in Thailand from November 2013 to October 2015. HIV risks and risk perception were evaluated through an anonymous survey. HIV testing with result notification and care appointment arrangement were provided on-site. Of the 358 participants; median age was 30 years; 206/358(58%) were at high risk for HIV acquisition; 148/358(41%) accepted HTC, all of whom either had prior negative HIV tests [98/148 (66%)] or had not known their HIV status [50/148 (34%)]. The three most common reasons for declining HTC were prior HIV testing within 6 months (48%), not ready (19%) and perceiving self as no risk (11%). Of the 262 moderate- and high-risk participants, 172 (66%) had false perception of low HIV risk which was significantly associated with declining HTC. Among the 148 participants undergoing HTC, 25 (17%) were HIV-infected. Having false perception of low risk (P = 0.004) and age <30 years (P = 0.02) were independently associated with HIV positivity. Only 14 of the 25 HIV-infected participants (56%) could be contacted after the result notification, of whom 12 (86%) had established HIV care and received immediate antiretroviral therapy. The active targeted HTC and facilitating care establishment was feasible among MSM attending the gay sauna but required strategies to improve accuracy of HIV-risk perception and linkage to care."
6482,0.005,1.0000,"We have studied the effects of human wild-type and mutant p53s on the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV). HeLa cells were cotransfected with a wild-type or mutant p53 expression plasmid and a plasmid containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene under HIV LTR promoter control. As expected, expression of wild-type p53 inhibited promoter function. Expression of a p53 mutated at any one of the four amino acid positions 175, 248, 273, and 281 correlated with a significant increase of the HIV promoter activity. The HIV LTR was also significantly activated in Saos-2 cells that do not express endogenous p53. This finding suggests a gain-of-transactivation function by mutation of the p53 gene. Cotransfection of wild-type and mutant p53-281G expression plasmids indicated that either the wild type or the mutant was dominant in inhibiting or enhancing promoter activity, respectively, when transfected in excess of the other. Transfection experiments showed transactivation even when the Sp1, NF-kappa B, and TATA sites in the LTR were individually mutated. Synthetic minimal promoter constructs containing two Sp1 sites or two NF-kappa B sites or an ATF site are also significantly activated by the mutant p53-281G. Thus, the mutant protein may activate transcription through interaction with either a general transcription factor or a common factor that bridges the basal transcription machinery and the transcription factors Sp1, NF-kappa B, and ATF."
4589,0.005,1.0000,"After the identification of HIV-2 in 1986, most of the cases reported have been concentrated in West Africa. We identified a case of HIV-2 infection in São Paulo, Brazil of a 45-year-old female who presented with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, with a CD4 count of 22 cells/ml. DNA samples from this patient were subjected to end-point PCR amplification of the LTR region. Clones were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. All clones were subtype A related, and four presented an insertion, corresponding to an extra NF-kappaB site. This is the first confirmed case report of an HIV-2-infected subject identified in Brazil whose transmission occurred within the country. Furthermore, the NF-kappaB duplication would potentially be associated with an increase in viral cytopathogenicity. This raises concern for the need for permanent monitoring of the spread of HIV-2 in different areas of the world, even considering its lower rate of transmission and pathogenicity when compared to HIV-1."

7929,0.005,1.0000,"Co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is relatively common. However, the impact of this co-infection on the clinical outcome of HIV infection has not been elucidated. We herein demonstrate that the HBV X protein (HBx) superinduces ongoing HIV-1 replication and HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transcription by synergizing with Tat protein and with T-cell activation signals. Although HBx cooperated with mitogenic stimuli in the induction of reporter plasmids harboring the HIV-1 kappaB enhancer, in both a NF-kappaB-dependent manner and a NF-AT-dependent manner, deletion of this element from the LTR did not affect the HBx-mediated up-regulation in the presence of Tat and/or mitogens. In contrast, mutation of the proximal LTR Sp1-binding sites abolished the HBx-mediated synergistic activation, but only when it was accompanied by deletion of the kappaB enhancer. When HBx was targeted to the nucleus, its ability to synergize with cellular activation stimuli was maintained. Furthermore, mutations of HBx affecting its interaction with the basal transcription machinery abrogated the synergistic activation by HBx, suggesting that this protein exerts its function by acting as a nuclear co-activator. These results indicate that HBx could contribute to a faster progression to AIDS in HBV-HIV co-infected individuals."

All patients harbored HIV-1 LTR quasispecies corresponding to the B subtype. Three patients with high CD4+ T cell counts (>500/mm3) presented LTR sequences with point mutations in the TAR bulge. The LTR sequence from a patient classified as a long-term nonprogressor (LTNP) presented the most frequent naturally occurring length polymorphism (MFNLP) and two substitutions in the TAR region that were predicted to result in two alternative secondary RNA structures. A novel 18-bp deletion, which eliminates part of the putative binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT-1), was identified in the overlapping nef/LTR sequence derived from a patient progressing to AIDS. This deletion coincides with the ability of this virus to consistently replicate at low levels in vivo (viral load <500 RNA copies/ml) and in vitro (unsuccessful virus isolation). On one occasion, when virus isolation was successful, the 18-bp deletion was no longer evident and LTR sequences with intact NFAT-1-binding sites were observed. Inoculation of hu-PBL-SCID mice with viruses from several Mexican patients resulted in differential CD4+ T cell depletion patterns 15 days postinfection, which agree with the in vivo CD4+ T cell count data from each patient."

After each TPEx procedure (2000 mL of fluid exchanged per session), HIV-1 genome molecule levels dropped to 58%-63% of the basal level but rapidly reverted to pre-TPEx values (doubling time = 3.50-4.04 h). Of interest, mobilization of extravascular cell-free virions (on average, 5.15 x 10(4) viral genome molecules/h) had already occurred during TPEx. After three daily TPEx procedures, HIV-1 viremia rebounded to basal values, while HIV-1 proviruses and viral transcripts in peripheral blood lymphocytes constantly tested at stable levels. Overall, this study extends previous analyses of the rate of HIV-1 turnover, using an alternative approach to the use of antiretroviral drugs, and it provides, albeit indirectly, insights into the amount and dynamic features of extravascular cell-free virus."

A search of the medical literature indicated this report is the first to describe a multiple silent HBV infection in an HIV/HCV-coinfected-patient. The elevated incidence of the anti-HBc alone pattern in HIV-positive patients and the increasing number of silent HBV infections detected in those patients demonstrate the need to carefully examine HIV-positive patients for occult HBV infection.

4693,0.005,1.0000,"Opiate-abusing individuals are in the top three risk-factor groups for HIV infection. In fact, almost 30% of HIV-infected individuals in the USA are reported to abuse opiates, highlighting the intersection of drugs of abuse with HIV/AIDS. Opiate-abusers are cognitively impaired and suffer from neurological dysfunctions that may lead to high-risk sexual behavior, poor adherence to antiretroviral regimens, and hepatitis-C virus infection. Collectively, these factors may contribute to accelerated HIV central nervous system (CNS) disease progression. To understand the role of morphine in disease progression, we sought to determine whether morphine influences HIV-induced inflammation or viral replication in human monocyte-derived macrophages (h-mdms) and MAGI cells infected with HIV and exposed to morphine. Chronic morphine exposure of HIV-infected h-mdms led to significant alterations in the secretion of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (MCP-2). Morphine enhanced IL-6 secretion and blunted MCP-2 secretion from HIV-infected h-mdms. However, exposure of HIV-infected h-mdms to morphine had no effect on tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion. Morphine had no effect on later stages of viral replication in HIV-infected h-mdms. Morphine had a potentially additive effect on the HIV-induced production of IL-6 and delayed HIV-induced MCP-2 production. These results suggest that in HIV-infected opiate-abusers, enhanced CNS inflammation might result even when HIV disease is controlled."
4494,0.005,1.0000,"Several studies have demonstrated that HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients experience more rapid fibrosis progression. In this study, to estimate the annual rate of direct liver fibrosis progression, we used analyses of paired biopsy samples from HIV/HCV-coinfected patients without prior treatment of hepatitis and assessed the possible association of fibrosis progression with certain clinical variables. We evaluated 30 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, with no history of prior treatment of hepatitis C, who underwent paired liver biopsies. All patients were under antiretroviral therapy at first and second biopsies. The average annual progression rate was 0.13 fibrosis unit/year, with 36.7% of patients defined as progressors. Liver fibrosis progression was associated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT; P < .001) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST; P < .0340) levels over 3 times the upper limit of normal present at first biopsy. Elevated ALT and AST levels appear to be associated with more accelerated liver fibrosis progression among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. "

To compare the frequencies and mutation patterns in the HBV genome between co-infection and mono-infection. Twenty-four treatment-naïve co-infected and 31 treatment-naïve mono-infected Thai patients were included. HBV mutations were characterized by whole genome sequencing of virus serum samples. The clinical features and frequency of known clinically significant mutations were compared between the two groups. No significant difference between the groups was found with respect to sex, age and HBeAg. However, HBV DNA levels were significantly higher in co-infected patients. The distribution of HBV genotypes was comparable between the two groups and restricted mostly to sub-genotypes C1 and B2. An isolate with recombinants of genotypes G/C1 was also identified in a patient with co-infection. There was no difference in the prevalence of mutations in the enhancer II/basal core promoter/precore region, pre-S/S and polymerase genes between the two groups. In conclusion, dual infections tend to engender increased HBV DNA levels. There was no major difference in the frequencies of common HBV mutations between co-infected and mono-infected patients. Thus, HBV mutations may not contribute to disease pathogenesis in Thai patients with co-infection."
8665,0.005,1.0000,"High levels of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication, as reflected in HIV-1 RNA concentrations in blood and semen, probably contribute to both rapid disease progression and enhanced sexual transmission. Semen and blood were collected from 49 Malawian and 61 US and Swiss (US/Swiss) HIV-1-seropositive men with similar CD4 cell counts and no urethritis or exposure to antiretroviral drugs. Median seminal plasma and blood plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations were >3-fold (P = .034) and 5-fold (P = .0003) higher, respectively, in the Malawian men. Similar differences were observed in subsets of the Malawian and US/Swiss study groups matched individually for CD4 cell count (P = .035 and P < .002, respectively). These observations may help explain the high rates of HIV-1 sexual transmission and accelerated HIV-1 disease progression in sub-Saharan Africa."
2794,0.005,1.0000,"An increased incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported among human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients or those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite this association, hitherto only a single case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported in an HIV-infected patient during pregnancy. We describe a young multiparous patient with long-standing AIDS who presented with lower abdominal pain. Following findings of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, low-grade fever, and mental status changes, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was diagnosed after initially considering the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia, and the patient was delivered by cesarean section. The patient required multiple plasma exchanges during a protracted postpartum course, and was discharged in good health. This first report of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and AIDS in pregnancy demonstrates that when encountering preeclampsia in patients with AIDS, thrombotic microangiopathy should be strongly considered. In addition, these patients may exhibit an attenuated response to plasma exchange therapy and despite previous reports in nonobstetric patients, a favorable outcome is attainable in these critically ill patients."
2070,0.005,1.0000,"This is the first-case report of isolated human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) infection that developed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the buccal mucosa. She was treated with radiotherapy 66 Gy in 30 fractions. HIV-2 infection was diagnosed with Tridot test, and quantitative estimation was done with polymerase chain reaction. Viral load is usually low in HIV-2 patients; similarly tempo of disease progression is also slow. Treatment of SCC of buccal mucosa with or without HIV infection is not different. Protease inhibitor-based anti-retroviral therapy is an appropriate treatment for HIV-2 infection. "
3437,0.005,1.0000,"Natural killer (NK) cells represent the first line of defence against viral infections but, in the case of hepatitis B virus (HBV), may also be involved in liver injury. We here compared NK-cell activity of 11 patients with acute HBV infection, either HIV-positive or HIV-negative, with that of 11 healthy subjects. One of the HIV-positive patients, characterized by a severe immunodeficiency, died 3 weeks after hospitalization for HBV-related fulminant hepatitis (FH). He displayed a remarkable NK-cell cytotoxicity against both cell lines and autologous dendritic cells, whereas the NK-cell activity of the remaining patients was significantly reduced as compared with healthy individuals. Our findings suggest that NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity could contribute to the development of HBV-related acute liver failure in HIV-positive patients with severe immunodeficiency. An immunopathological model of FH in immunocompromised patients was proposed."
7795,0.005,1.0000,"In most HIV-1-infected patients, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reduces plasma viral load to <50 copies/mL and increases CD4+ T-cell number and function. However, it is still unclear whether alterations of T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain variable region (BV) repertoire, tightly related to disease progression, can be fully recovered by long-term treatment with HAART. This study analyzed the evolution of both T-cell subset composition and TCRBV perturbations in chronically HIV-1-infected patients with moderate immunodeficiency during 36 months of HAART. Despite persistently suppressed HIV replication, the rate of CD4+ T-cell repopulation, after an initial burst, progressively declined throughout the study period, resulting in a mean CD4+ T-cell count at the end of follow-up that was still significantly lower in HIV patients than in HIV-seronegative controls. This was seen in association with an incomplete restitution of both CD4 and CD8 TCRBV repertoire disruptions and was also demonstrated by the appearance of new TCRBV oligoclonal expansions occurring during HAART. In conclusion, these data indicate that 3 years of fully suppressive HAART may be not adequate to normalize CD4 counts and TCRBV repertoires in patients starting HAART with moderately advanced disease."
5186,0.005,1.0000,"The presented study examined the incidence, risk factors and outcome of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia (NBP) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects. Forty-two cases of NBP were ascertained by a 5-yr prospective surveillance and were matched to 84 controls. NBP incidence was 10.8 per 10,000 hospital patient-days. In particular, the incidence of NBP was 13.9 per 10,000 patient-days in the period 1994-1996 and 5.6 per 10,000 patient-days in the period 1997-1998 (p=0.01). By using regression analysis, predictors for developing NBP were an increasing value of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score (p<0.01) and the presence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related central nervous system (CNS) diseases (p=0.01). The additional hospital stay attributable to NBP was 15 days. The attributable mortality rate was estimated to be 29%. Nosocomial bacterial pneumonia is more common in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection, high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score and central nervous system diseases. Although the incidence of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia, as well of other opportunistic infections, decreased considerably in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, it still represents an important cause of mortality."
991,0.005,1.0000,"Both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 seroconversions have been considered as outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of needle exchange programs. To assess the relationships between incident HBV and HIV infections among injecting drug users (IDUs), seroconversions were prospectively studied among a cohort of 240 HBV- and HIV- seronegative IDUs. The incidence of HBV seroconversion declined from 24.41/100 person-years in 1988 to 0 seroconversions in 1992. In contrast, HIV seroconversion rates varied little from the overall rate of 3.29/100 person-years. HBV seroconversion predicted subsequent HIV seroconversion among male IDUs (relative incidence [RI]= 4.23) but not among female IDUs (RI=0.86). Because of different transmission dynamics, HBV seroconversion probably has limited utility as a surrogate outcome measure for incident HIV. However, HBV seroconversion itself is an appropriate and important outcome measure for evaluation of prevention programs among IDUs."
4010,0.005,1.0000,"Neurologic complications associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection vary geographically. To understand the pattern of HIV-associated neurologic complications in Mexico, 120 AIDS patients from Mexico City, Mexico, and 500 AIDS patients from Houston, Texas, were studied cross-sectionally and retrospectively. Neurologic, laboratory, imaging, and pathologic examinations identified 40 Mexican patients and 130 U.S. patients with neurologic complications. Whereas AIDS dementia complex was the most common neurologic manifestation in both groups, intracranial tuberculoma was present only in the Mexican population (10%). Primary brain lymphoma was more prevalent in the U.S. population (8.4%). The different findings in the Mexican population likely reflect afflictions common to developing countries--a high prevalence of tuberculosis and a high mortality rate. These conditions preclude complications such as lymphoma, which develop later in the natural course of HIV infection."
3505,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) is entering into its third decade affecting more than 40 million persons on the plane, with an extraordinary incidence in the underdeveloped world, especially in the African continent where more than 25 million are affected, with more than 3 million new yearly infections and where the life expectancy is at 47 years. Although the vaccination is still far away, the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy in the middle of the 90's was an important advance that contributed to converting an infection that previously had a very high rate of short-term mortality into a chronic disease. The neurological complications of this infection vary enormously. They affect any location of the neuroaxis and can appear at any stage of infection. It is not rare that more than one neurological complication exists. Such complications may be a consequence of the infection itself (primary) or related with immune depression accompanying it (secondary). Among the former, dementia associated to HIV and peripheral polyneuropathy stand out. Among the latter, opportunistic viral and fungal infections and lymphoma of the nervous systems stand out. In recent years different tests that help to establish the diagnoses of these entities have been developed, a necessary step to initiate adequate therapies. The immune state of the patient, reflected by the peripheral count of CD4 lymphocytes and serum viral load, helps us to establish the most likely causes of the neurological problems that appear in the context of this infection. We briefly review the most outstanding characteristics of each one of them in this work."
4626,0.005,1.0000,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by the JC virus (JCV), a human papovavirus. PML is a relatively rare disease seen predominantly in immunocompromised individuals and is a frequent complication observed in AIDS patients. The significantly higher incidence of PML in AIDS patients than in other immunosuppressive disorders has suggested that the presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the brain may directly or indirectly contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. In the present study we have examined the expression of the JCV genome in both glial and non-glial cells in the presence of HIV-1 regulatory proteins. We find that the HIV-1-encoded trans-regulatory protein tat increases the basal activity of the JCV late promoter, JCVL, in glial cells. In a reciprocal experiment, the JCV early protein, the large tumor antigen, stimulates expression from JCVL and HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter in both glial and non-glial cells. This trans-activation occurs at the level of RNA synthesis, as measured by the rate of transcription, stability of the message, and translation. We conclude that the presence of the HIV-1-encoded tat protein may positively affect the JCV lytic cycle in glial cells by stimulating JCV gene expression. Our results suggest a mechanism for the relatively high incidence of PML in AIDS patients than in other immunosuppressive disorders. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the HIV-1 regulatory protein tat may stimulate other viral and perhaps cellular promoters, in addition to its own."
1354,0.005,1.0000,"Incarcerated women as a group are particularly vulnerable to infections. The lack of public programs for prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment contribute to the increase in the incidence and prevalence of diseases in general and especially sexually transmitted diseases. This article aims to estimate the prevalence of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and syphilis among inmates at the Women's Penitentiary in the State capital of São Paulo, Brazil. All inmates were invited to participate in the study, which was divided into two stages: 1. STD/AIDS preventive workshops including interviews and 2. laboratory tests. The interview covered knowledge of STD/AIDS, risk behavior, and individual reproductive health history. A total of 262 women, with a mean age of 32.4 years and limited schooling, participated in more than one stage of the study. Prevalence rates were 14.5% for HIV, 16.3% for high-oncogenic-risk HPV probes, 4.8% for low-oncogenic-risk HPV probes, and 5.7% for syphilis. The authors conclude that STD/HIV constitute a serious health problem in the prison system, requiring urgent preventive measures."
7553,0.005,1.0000,"Dried blood spots (DBSs) on filter paper are being used increasingly in population-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) studies. This study evaluated the application of a BED enzyme immunoassay (EIA) on DBSs to estimate HIV incidence in a population-based study in India. The Calypte HIV-1 BED Incidence EIA was performed on 224 HIV-1-positive DBS samples, after screening 12 617 individuals from a population-based sample in Guntur district in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The number of recently infected HIV cases was identified using this BED assay and was used to estimate the annual HIV incidence rate based on calculations and adjustment formulae suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The updated BED data management software provided by the CDC was used for analyses. Of the 224 HIV-1 antibody-positive DBS samples, 29 (12.95 %) were estimated by the BED HIV-1 assay to have been infected within the past 155 days. After adjusting for age, gender and rural/urban distribution of the population, the annual incidence rate of HIV-1 infection was estimated to be 0.32 % (95 % confidence interval 0.20-0.44 %). This annual incidence was 18.6 % of the HIV prevalence of 1.72 % in this study. Thus, the BED assay revealed a higher incidence of HIV in this study than was expected from the prevalence. Correlation of the BED assay with panel testing and longitudinal incidence data in the Indian population is needed to calibrate it for use in India."
439,0.005,1.0000,"The authors have examined two separate series of samples from 33 and 23 anti-HIV positive patients with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) undergoing lymphnode biopsy. For the first group of patients, the aim was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic correlation between clinical and laboratory features and histologic findings. For the second group, an assessment was made of the indications for lymphnode biopsy as determined by the rate of positive histopathologic findings. Histologic alterations were classified into four types according to Ràcz, without knowledge of clinical and laboratory data. At the time of biopsy, the first sample (n = 33) included 21 lymphadenopathy associated syndrome (LAS) (64%), 6 ARC (18%), and 6 AIDS (18%) patients; a significant prevalence of type 1 histologic features was evident in LAS/ARC patients, while type 4 was exclusively present in the AIDS group. These preliminary results suggested that only symptomatic anti-HIV positive patients (ARC/AIDS) should have been selected for lymphnode biopsy, because of the expected high rate of opportunistic infections, malignant lymphoma, or Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in this specific subset of patients. Actually, in the second sample of 23 patients (ARC = 8: AIDS = 15) the detection rate of AIDS-related neoplasms included ten Kaposi's sarcoma and three Hodgkin's disease. These findings suggest that diagnostic lymphnode biopsies should be limited to selected anti-HIV positive patients with evidence of AIDS-related neoplasms or treatable opportunistic infections, or for the purpose of detecting histopathologic features of prognostic significance."
9297,0.005,1.0000,"Increased expression of CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain is consistently observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) central nervous system (CNS) disease. The molecular basis for the correlation between increased expression of CCL2 and HIV neuropathogenesis has been linked to a polymorphism at -2578 in the promoter of human CCL2, which was reported to influence the rate of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the predisposition of HIV-infected individuals to develop HIV-associated dementia. However, because the rate of neurological deterioration essentially parallels the progression of immunosuppression, it is inherently difficult to uncouple the influence of this polymorphism on increased progression to AIDS from increased propensity to develop CNS complications. To further investigate the correlation between CCL2 and HIV/SIV CNS disease, the authors sequenced the CCL2 promoter of 29 pigtailed macaques examined in their accelerated and consistent SIV model in which all infected macaques develop AIDS but only 69% developed moderate/severe CNS lesions. Sequence analysis identified 39 sites of nucleotide variation in the pigtailed macaque CCL2 promoter/enhancer regions, with the resulting consensus sequence aligning with 94.7% homology to the human CCL2 promoter. After genetic analyses, no variation was found to correlate with the incidence or severity of CNS lesions or with levels of CCL2 in plasma or CSF. These findings suggest that the determinants of neuropathogenesis in this SIV model are distinct from variation in these regions of the CCL2 promoter."
5086,0.005,1.0000,"Conceptually, blocking human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration is the last possibility for preventing irreversible cellular infection. Using cocultures of monocyte-derived dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cells, which represent primary targets in sexual transmission, we demonstrated that blocking integration with integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs), particularly L-870812, could consistently block cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 infection. In a pretreatment setting in which the compound was present before and during infection and was afterwards gradually diluted during the culture period, the naphthyridine carboxamide L-870812 blocked infection with the cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 Ba-L strain at concentrations of, respectively, 1,000 and 10,000 nM. The potency of L-870812 was similar to that of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor R-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl) adenine (PMPA) but one or two orders of magnitude lower than those of the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors UC781 and TMC120. In contrast, the diketo acid RDS derivative InSTIs showed clear-cut but weaker antiviral activity than L-870812. Moreover, L-870812 completely blocked subtype C and CRFO2_AG primary isolates, which are prevalent in the African heterosexual epidemic. Furthermore, the addition of micromolar concentrations of L-870812 even 24 h after infection could still block both cell-free and cell-associated Ba-L, opening the prospect of postexposure prophylaxis. Finally, an evaluation of the combined activity of L-870812 with either T20, zidovudine, PMPA, UC781, or TMC120 against replication-deficient HIV-1 Ba-L (env) pseudovirus suggested synergistic activity for all combinations. Importantly, compounds selected for the study by using the coculture model were devoid of acute or delayed cytotoxic effects at HIV-blocking concentrations. Therefore, these findings provide evidence supporting consideration of HIV-1 integration as a target for microbicide development."
3566,0.005,1.0000,"In 1994, the US Public Health Service published guidelines for the use of zidovudine to decrease the risk of perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1995, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the US Public Health Service recommended documented, routine HIV education and testing with consent for all pregnant women in the United States. Widespread incorporation of these guidelines into clinical practice has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the rate of perinatal HIV transmission and has contributed to more than a 75% decrease in reported cases of pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) since 1992. Substantial advances have been made in the treatment and monitoring of HIV infection; combination antiretroviral regimens that maximally suppress virus replication are now available. These regimens are recommended for pregnant and nonpregnant individuals who require treatment. Risk factors associated with perinatal HIV transmission are now better understood, and recent results from trials to decrease the rate of mother-to-child HIV transmission have contributed new strategies with established efficacy. However, perinatal HIV transmission still occurs; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 300 to 400 infected infants are born annually. Full implementation of recommendations for universal, routine prenatal HIV testing and evaluation of missed prevention opportunities will be critical to further decrease the incidence of pediatric HIV infection in the United States. This technical report summarizes recent advances in the prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV relevant to screening of pregnant women and their infants."
4076,0.005,1.0000,"GS-9160 is a novel and potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase (IN) that specifically targets the process of strand transfer. It is an authentic inhibitor of HIV-1 integration, since treatment of infected cells results in an elevation of two-long terminal repeat circles and a decrease of integration junctions. GS-9160 has potent and selective antiviral activity in primary human T lymphocytes producing a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of approximately 2 nM, with a selectivity index (50% cytotoxic concentration/EC(50)) of approximately 2,000. The antiviral potency of GS-9160 decreased by 6- to 10-fold in the presence of human serum. The antiviral activity of GS-9160 is synergistic in combination with representatives from three different classes of antiviral drugs, namely HIV-1 protease inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Viral resistance selections performed with GS-9160 yielded a novel pattern of mutations within the catalytic core domain of IN; E92V emerged initially, followed by L74M. While E92V as a single mutant conferred 12-fold resistance against GS-9160, L74M had no effect as a single mutant. Together, these mutations conferred 67-fold resistance to GS-9160, indicating that L74M may potentiate the resistance caused by E92V. The pharmacokinetic profile of GS-9160 in healthy human volunteers revealed that once-daily dosing was not likely to achieve antiviral efficacy; hence, the clinical development of this compound was discontinued."
9016,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) gene sequences obtained during antiretroviral resistance testing with a commercial genotyping assay (Tru Gene; Bayer Corp.) were analyzed to assess the utility of these data for detecting and characterizing non-subtype-B HIV-1 strains. A total of 125 viral sequences obtained from patients believed to have acquired their HIV-1 infection in Africa were analyzed, of which 121 were determined to belong to non-B subtypes. Utilizing Tru Gene sequence data alone, 92 (76%) of these viruses could be subtyped by conventional phylogenetic analysis. The addition of supplemental RT sequence data enabled a further 28 (23.1%) viruses to be classified, while one (0.9%) sample could not be classified conclusively. Two internet-accessible databases that generate HIV-1 subtypes from PR and RT sequences (HIV-SEQ and Geno 2 Pheno) were also evaluated, and both achieved 88% concordance (106/120) with phylogenetic analysis. Non-subtype-B and B-subtype HIV-1 sequences could be readily discriminated by tallying silent polymorphisms listed on the Tru Gene research report. The mean number of silent polymorphisms in the non-B HIV-1 sequences identified in this study was 58.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.1 to 75.5), compared with 20.7 (95% CI, 9.9 to 31.5) for the four subtype B viruses in the study cohort and 118 case-matched B-subtype controls. Sequence data generated in the Tru Gene HIV-1 genotyping assay could, therefore, provide a ready means of tracking the prevalence and identity of non-B subtypes in HIV-1-infected populations undergoing routine antiretroviral resistance testing."
8390,0.005,1.0000,"Over the previous years, comprehensive studies on antiretroviral drugs resulted in the successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) into clinical practice for treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there is still need for new therapeutic approaches, since HAART cannot eradicate HIV-1 from the infected organism and, unfortunately, can be associated with long-term toxicity and the development of drug resistance. In contrast, novel gene therapy strategies may have the potential to reverse the infection by eradicating HIV-1. For example, expression of long terminal repeat (LTR)-specific recombinase (Tre-recombinase) has been shown to result in chromosomal excision of proviral DNA and, in consequence, in the eradication of HIV-1 from infected cell cultures. However, the delivery of Tre-recombinase currently depends on the genetic manipulation of target cells, a process that is complicating such therapeutic approaches and, thus, might be undesirable in a clinical setting. In this report we demonstrate that E.coli expressed Tre-recombinases, tagged either with the protein transduction domain (PTD) from the HIV-1 Tat trans-activator or the translocation motif (TLM) of the Hepatitis B virus PreS2 protein, were able to translocate efficiently into cells and showed significant recombination activity on HIV-1 LTR sequences. Tre activity was observed using episomal and stable integrated reporter constructs in transfected HeLa cells. Furthermore, the TLM-tagged enzyme was able to excise the full-length proviral DNA from chromosomal integration sites of HIV-1-infected HeLa and CEM-SS cells. The presented data confirm Tre-recombinase activity on integrated HIV-1 and provide the basis for the non-genetic transient application of engineered recombinases, which may be a valuable component of future HIV eradication strategies."
3004,0.005,1.0000,"The impact of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) on anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) was studied in 17 patients with recent symptomatic HIV-1 primary infection receiving triple combination therapy. Anti-HIV CTL were initially detected in 15 patients. In 6, CTL disappeared rapidly and persistently after initiation of therapy. Most of them had a rapid and sustained decrease in plasma HIV RNA to undetectable levels. Conversely, in 6 other patients, CTL remained detectable, which was associated with a less efficient control of viral replication. In 3 others, CTL disappeared only transiently, without clear correlation with the virologic profile. Altogether, despite individual variations, there was a positive correlation between viral replication and anti-HIV-1 cytotoxicity in most subjects, suggesting that the persistence of viral antigens is the main determinant for the maintenance of CTL activity. This raises the question of the potential benefit of anti-HIV CTL induction by immunotherapy in acute seroconverters treated by HAART."
1603,0.005,1.0000,"Lentiviral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) show great promise as gene carriers for future gene therapy. Insertion of a fragment containing the central polypurine tract (cPPT) in HIV-1 vector constructs is known to enhance transduction efficiency drastically, reportedly by facilitating the nuclear import of HIV-1 cDNA through a central DNA flap. We have studied the impact of the cPPT on the kinetics of HIV-1 vector transduction by real-time PCR. The kinetics of total HIV-1 DNA, two-long-terminal-repeat (2-LTR) circles, and, by an Alu-PCR, integrated proviral DNA were monitored. About 6 to 12 h after transduction, the total HIV-1 DNA reached a maximum level, followed by a steep decrease. The 2-LTR circles peaked after 24 to 48 h and were diluted upon cell division. Integration of HIV-1 DNA was first detected at 12 h postinfection. When HIV-1 vectors that contained the cPPT were used, DNA synthesis was similar but a threefold higher amount of 2-LTR circles was detected, confirming the impact on nuclear import. Moreover, a 10-fold increase in the amount of integrated DNA was observed in the presence of the cPPT. Only in the absence of the cPPT was a saturation in 2-LTR circle formation seen at a high multiplicity of infection, suggesting a role for the cPPT in overcoming a barrier to the nuclear import of HIV-1 DNA. A major effect of the central DNA flap on the juxtaposition of both LTRs is unlikely, since transduction with HIV-1 vectors containing ectopic cPPT fragments resulted in increased amounts of 2-LTR circles as well as integrated DNA. Inhibitors of transduction by cPPT-containing HIV vectors were also studied by real-time PCR. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine (AZT) and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor alpha-APA clearly inhibited viral DNA synthesis, whereas integrase inhibitors such as the diketo acid L-708,906 and the pyranodipyrimidine V-165 specifically inhibited integration."
8885,0.005,1.0000,"One of the main characteristics of the human immunodeficiency virus is its genetic variability and rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions. This variability, resulting from the lack of proofreading activity of the viral reverse transcriptase, generates mutations that could be fixed either by random genetic drift or by positive selection. Among the forces driving positive selection are antiretroviral therapy and CD8+ T-cells, the most important immune mechanism involved in viral control. Here, we describe mutations induced by these selective forces acting on the pol gene of HIV in a group of infected individuals. We used Maximum Likelihood analyses of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations per site (dN/dS) to study the extent of positive selection in the protease and the reverse transcriptase, using 614 viral sequences from Colombian patients. We also performed computational approaches, docking and algorithmic analyses, to assess whether the positively selected mutations affected binding to the HLA molecules. We found 19 positively-selected codons in drug resistance-associated sites and 22 located within CD8+ T-cell epitopes. A high percentage of mutations in these epitopes has not been previously reported. According to the docking analyses only one of those mutations affected HLA binding. However, algorithmic methods predicted a decrease in the affinity for the HLA molecule in seven mutated peptides. The bioinformatics strategies described here are useful to identify putative positively selected mutations associated with immune escape but should be complemented with an experimental approach to define the impact of these mutations on the functional profile of the CD8+ T-cells.

4213,0.005,1.0000,"According to World Health Organization (WHO)/Joint United Nations Programme on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (UNAIDS) Report in 2007, 33.2 million people are living with HIV, 2.5 million ones have been newly infected with HIV, and 2.1 million ones died from AIDS, including 330,000 children. Therefore, HIV/AIDS still remains a public health emergency and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. It is believed that reverse transcriptase (RT) is a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of HIV-1, and thereby RT has been the important drug target for antiretroviral (ARV) chemotherapy against AIDS. To our knowledge, dipyridodiazepinone analogs have been considered as one class of potential non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), especially the structurally and chemically related nevirapine (Viramune(R)), which was the first NNRTI approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection for adults in 1996 and for children in 1998. This review mainly highlights the progress of synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of dipyridodiazepinone analogs; in the meantime, the mechanism of action is also presented. It will pave the way for the design and development of novel dipyridodiazepinone analogs as NNRTIs in AIDS chemotherapy in the future."
58,0.005,1.0000,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have been suggested to contribute to viral clearance during hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. To induce effective CTL against viral infection by peptide vaccination, it is essential to identify the epitope peptides recognized by CTL. Here, 15 peptide sequences that contain HLA-A2.1-restricted CTL binding consensus motif were identified on hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein and synthesized for further characterization. In the binding assay, 8 of 15 synthetic peptides enhanced the expression of HLA-A2.1 molecules on the surface of T2 cells, a human transport-associated antigen processing-deficient cell line. This result implies that these eight peptides are able to bind to the HLA-A2.1 molecules. These peptides were further tested for their ability to activate CTL from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from HBV chronic carriers. Five of eight tested peptides activated PBMC-derived T cells, resulting in the lysis of the target T2 cells pulsed with the same peptide. Furthermore, the CTL responses to HBx antigen in HBV chronic carriers were shown to be polyclonal, multispecific, and mediated mainly by CD8+ T cells. In contrast, these responses were not detected in uninfected healthy blood donors. Although the five CTL epitope peptides identified in this study have not been proven to be the naturally processed epitopes in HBV-infected hepatocytes, they could be candidates for peptide-based immunotherapy against HBV infection."
5909,0.005,1.0000,"The absence of readily manipulable experimental systems to study the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigens has thus far precluded a definitive demonstration of the role played by this response in the pathogenesis of liver cell injury and viral clearance during HBV infection. To circumvent the problem that HBV infection of human cells in vitro for production of stimulator/target systems for CTL analysis is not feasible, a panel of 22 overlapping synthetic peptides covering the entire amino acid sequence of the HBV core (HBcAg) and e (HBeAg) antigens were used to induce and to analyze the HBV nucleocapsid-specific CTL response in nine patients with acute hepatitis B, six patients with chronic active hepatitis B, and eight normal controls. By using this approach, we have identified an HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitope, located within the NH2-terminal region of the HBV core molecule, which is shared with the e antigen and is readily recognized by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with self-limited acute hepatitis B but less efficiently in chronic HBV infection. Our study provides the first direct evidence of HLA class I-restricted T cell cytotoxicity against HBV in humans. Furthermore, the different response in HBV-infected subjects who successfully clear the virus (acute patients) in comparison with patients who do not succeed (chronic patients) suggests a pathogenetic role for this CTL activity in the clearance of HBV infection."
8495,0.005,1.0000,"Proviral human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA could be a useful marker for exploring viral reservoirs and monitoring antiretroviral treatment, particularly when HIV-1 RNA is undetectable in plasma. A new technique was developed to quantify proviral HIV-1 using a TaqMan real-time PCR assay. One copy of proviral HIV-1 DNA could be detected with 100% sensitivity for five copies and the assay had a range of 6 log(10). Reproducibility was evaluated in intra- and interassays using independent extractions of the 8E5 cell line harboring the HIV-1 proviral genome (coefficients of variation [CV], 13 and 27%, respectively) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a patient with a mean proviral load of 26 copies per 10(6) PBMC (CV, 46 and 56%, respectively). The median PBMC proviral load of 21 patients, measured in a cross-sectional study, was determined to be 215 copies per 10(6) PBMC (range, <10 to 8,381). In a longitudinal study, the proviral load of 15 out of 16 patients with primary infection fell significantly during 1 year of antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.004). In the remaining patient, proviral HIV-1 DNA was detectable but not quantifiable due to a point mutation at the 5' end of the TaqMan probe. No correlation was observed between proviral load and levels of CD4(+) cells or HIV-1 RNA in plasma. TaqMan PCR is sensitive and adaptable to a large series of samples. The full interest of monitoring proviral HIV-1 DNA can now be ascertained by its application to the routine monitoring of patients."
357,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of the study was to select, from a panel of candidate European human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) clade B primary virus isolates, one isolate based on replication properties in chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Secondly, to evaluate the in vivo kinetics of primary infection of the selected isolate at two different doses in two mature, outbred chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Four different low passage, human PBMC-cultured 'primary' HIV-1 isolates with European clade B consensus sequence were compared for their ability to replicate in vitro in chimpanzee versus human PBMC. The isolate which yielded the highest titre and most vigorous cytopathic effect in chimpanzee PBMC was evaluated for coreceptor usage and chosen for evaluation in vivo. Only the HIV-1Han2 isolate replicated in chimpanzee PBMC in vitro at detectable levels. This isolate was demonstrated to utilize CCR4, CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors and could be inhibited by beta-chemokines. Infection of chimpanzees was demonstrated by viral RNA and DNA PCR analysis, both in plasma as well as in PBMC and lymph node cells as early as 3 weeks after inoculation. Antibodies developed within 6 weeks and continued to increase to a maximum titre of approximately 12800, thereafter remaining in this range over the follow-up period of 2 years. Compared to cell line-adapted HIV-1 isolates there were slight but no dramatic differences in the kinetics of infection of chimpanzees with this particular primary isolate."
7335,0.005,1.0000,"We report a large monocentric case series of 82 patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). No germline mutations of the PPH1 gene (bone morphogenetic protein receptor-II) were found in any of the 19 patients tested. PAH was the direct cause of death in 72% of cases. Survival rates of the overall population at 1, 2, and 3 years were 73, 60, and 47%, respectively. Survival was significantly poorer in patients in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV at the time of diagnosis, as compared with those in functional class I-II with respective rates of 60, 45, and 28% versus 100, 90, 84% at 1, 2, and 3 years (p < 0.0001). Subsequently, we analyzed prognostic factors in patients in functional class III-IV. Univariate analysis indicated that CD4 lymphocyte count of more than 212 cells mm(-3), the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), and epoprostenol infusion were related with a better survival. On multivariate analysis only CD4 lymphocyte count was an independent predictor of survival, presumably because CART and epoprostenol infusion were strongly linked in our patient population. These results suggest that patients with severe human immunodeficiency virus-associated PAH should be considered for long-term epoprostenol infusion in association with CART."
2495,0.005,1.0000,"To estimate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) among parturients in an area with a high cumulative incidence of AIDS, an HIV seroprevalence study was conducted in 1988 in Los Angeles County. Test results were available from 8485 (86.1%) of the 9860 women delivering at four public hospitals. The test results were linked to demographic and medical information available from routinely collected delivery records. Three specimens were HIV-positive, for a seroprevalence of 3.5 per 10,000. The seropositive women were all Latina. The prevalence of HIV among women delivering at all hospitals in Los Angeles County has been shown to be relatively low compared with that of other metropolitan areas with a high number of AIDS cases, such as New York city, but appears to be even lower among women delivering at public hospitals during this time period. This low prevalence is attributed to the predominance of Latinas, who may have lower levels of infection, among public hospital parturients. The relatively low prevalence of HIV among injection drug users in Los Angeles County may contribute to the overall lower prevalence among women in Los Angeles County compared with those in New York city. This study supplements county-specific data obtained from statewide blinded neonatal testing by providing details on HIV seroprevalence among the catchment populations of public hospitals in Los Angeles County."
5025,0.005,1.0000,"Exenatide is an incretin mimetic indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, metformin, or metformin plus a sulfonylurea or thiazolidinedione. Exenatide lowers postprandial blood glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and increasing satiety. Therapy with exenatide often results in weight loss, which further assists in decreasing insulin resistance. This feature makes the drug an attractive therapeutic option for obese patients. We report the successful off-label use of exenatide in an obese, 40-year-old man with type 1 diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who had gastrointestinal intolerance to pramlintide. The patient had experienced a dramatic weight gain secondary to his antiretroviral drugs. This weight gain led to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes; thus he had characteristics of both types 1 and 2 diabetes, or double diabetes. Before the start of exenatide therapy, he weighed 123 kg, had a body mass index of 42.3 kg/m(2), and had a suboptimal hemoglobin A(1c) value of 8.7%. After 11 months of therapy, the patient lost 24 kg (19.5% of his body weight) and achieved a hemoglobin A(1c) value of 7.3%. His basal insulin requirement was reduced by 25%, and his use of short-acting insulin before breakfast and before dinner was discontinued. In addition, the patient's quality of life substantially improved, as he was able to return to work and exercise after being nearly incapacitated by his weight. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of the use of exenatide in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Given this experience, exenatide may prove to be a useful alternative in selected patients with type 1 diabetes."
9245,0.005,1.0000,"Campylobacter fetus subspecies fetus has been recognized as a cause of systemic illness in immunocompromised hosts, including relapsing bacteremia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Acquired resistance to quinolone therapy, while reported for a variety of bacteria, including Campylobacter jejuni, has not been previously documented for C. fetus. Two cases of quinolone-resistant C. fetus bacteremia were detected in HIV-infected patients. Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the C. fetus gyrA gene in the 2 resistant isolates demonstrated a G-to-T change that led to an Asp-to-Tyr amino acid substitution at a critical residue frequently associated with quinolone resistance. In addition, comparison of the pre- and posttreatment isolates from 1 patient documented outer membrane protein changes temporally linked with the development of resistance. Relapsing C. fetus infections in quinolone-treated HIV-infected patients may be associated with the acquisition of resistance to these agents, and this resistance may be multifactorial."
6790,0.005,1.0000,"There is little information on infections caused by larval cestodes in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in developed countries. Two infections by larval cestodes were found in 714 HIV-infected patients studied from 1998 to 2004 at the Hospital General Universitario de Elche in Spain (Mediterranean Coast). The first patient was a Colombian immigrant diagnosed as having neurocysticercosis, and subsequently found to have HIV infection. The second case was an HIV-infected Spanish patient who developed hydatid disease of the liver, lung and peritoneum. Both patients died. Although infrequent, infections by larval cestodes constitute a cause of disease in HIV-infected patients in developed countries, and might be linked with a more severe presentation."
7039,0.005,1.0000,"Although perinatal transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is well documented, seroprevalence rates of HIV in populations of women of reproductive age have not yet been reported. To determine the seroprevalence of HIV in childbearing women from a population with a high incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cord blood samples were collected from 602 infants delivered at an inner-city municipal hospital in New York. Demographic and HIV risk factor information was also collected from mothers of these infants. Twelve (2%) of 602 samples (95% confidence interval, 1% to 4%) were positive for HIV on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. In interviews, seven of 12 seropositive women had risk factors as defined by the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta; the remaining five seropositive women had no self-identified risk factors. The HIV seroprevalence rate in our hospital (2.0%) is several times higher than that of many other diseases for which screening is already routine. This serosurvey indicates that HIV infection of inner-city parturients is a significant problem that warrants broadly implemented health strategies. Furthermore, the data also suggest that if risk factor information elicited by physicians is used to initiate HIV antibody counseling and testing of pregnant women, a significant number of seropositive parturients is missed. In areas with significant seroprevalence rates of HIV infection, a broader counseling and testing program may be needed."
6713,0.005,1.0000,"There is increasing evidence that cytokines contribute to the immunopathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It may be, therefore, that compensatory rises in circulating cytokine antagonists also occur in HIV infection and that such changes mark disease progression. To test this idea, plasma concentrations of the cytokine antagonists alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNFr) were measured in patients of different Centers for Disease Control (CDC) categories of HIV infection and in seronegative controls. Plasma levels of all these cytokine antagonists were higher in HIV-infected patients. IL-1ra and sTNFr concentrations were correlated with indicators of disease activity: positively with plasma neopterin and negatively with CD4+ T lymphocyte counts. alpha-MSH and sTNF r were greater in CDC groups III and IV, whereas IL-1ra was elevated only in the latter group. Because cytokines activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and adrenal steroids inhibit cytokine production, we measured circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol in HIV-infected patients and investigated relations among these hormones, cytokine antagonists, and markers of disease progression. It appears that these physiological modulators of cytokine activity are not closely linked to sTNFr, IL-1ra and alpha-MSH: there were no significant correlations between plasma concentrations of ACTH or cortisol and those of cytokine antagonists, nor were there correlations between hormones and markers of disease progression such as neopterin or CD4+ T cell counts. It is notable that severe adrenal insufficiency was extremely rare (3%) in HIV-infected patients; it was confined to the AIDS group and was consistently secondary to ACTH deficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
4467,0.005,1.0000,"To disclose the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the tuberculosis epidemic in Taiwan, we prospectively screened for HIV infection in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. A total of 378 patients who were admitted to the Taiwan Provincial Chronic Disease Control Bureau from January through December 1996 were enrolled. HIV serologic testing was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A positive ELISA test was confirmed by Western blot analysis. One patient was infected with HIV. We conclude that the impact of HIV infection on the epidemic of tuberculosis in Taiwan is not significant at present."
7735,0.005,1.0000,"Autoantibodies to the CD4 protein, which serves as a receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the surface of target cells, were found in patients with different stages of HIV disease. Using recombinant soluble CD4 (rCD4) antigen in a enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we detected serum anti-CD4 antibodies in approximately 20% of HIV-1 infected patients and 13% of HIV-2 infected patients. There was no correlation between the presence of anti-CD4 antibodies and the stage of HIV disease, serum IgG concentration, number of peripheral blood CD4 positive lymphocytes, or CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratios in HIV-1 infected patients. Immunoaffinity purified anti-CD4 antibody failed to bind to CD4 positive cells using flow cytometric analysis. However, this antibody could weakly bind to CD4 positive cells that had been preincubated with purified recombinant gp120 (rgp120). In addition, using an ELISA system, we found that the binding of purified patient anti-CD4 antibody to rCD4 was increased in the presence of rgp120. Similar increased binding was observed with the anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody OKT4, but not with anti-Leu3a. These data suggest that a conformational change in the C-terminal domains of CD4 may be induced by gp120 binding and could lead to development of anti-CD4 antibodies."
1353,0.005,1.0000,"A 29-year-old Ghanaian woman who developed AIDS while being HIV-antibody seronegative was investigated during a collaborative study aimed at the identification of viral causes of a HIV-seronegative AIDS syndrome in West Africa. Plasma was screened with a panel of EIA tests for antibodies to HIV and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Retroviral infection was investigated by detection of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in plasma, viral RNA amplification and quantification, and virus isolation. Positive amplification products were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were carried out. Most EIA tests were unable to demonstrate the presence of anti-HIV anti-bodies, whereas confirmatory assays yielded inconclusive results. Retroviral infection was documented by detection of RT activity, HIV-1-specific genomic amplification and virus isolation. This virus was HIV-1 subtype A with an unusual six amino acid insertion in the gp120 V4 loop and with the nef gene of subtype G. The patient's plasma did not react with either autologous or heterologous viral lysates or HIV-1 peptides, whereas antibodies to other viral antigens were present. In conclusion, the Ghanaian patient exhibited a rare subtype A/G recombinant HIV-1 infection with a near absence of a HIV-specific humoral response. The lack of detectable antibody response might be due to either a highly pathogenic, rapidly fatal, HIV-1 infection preventing the development of the typical humoral immune response or to a host-related dysfunction of the immune system. Direct antigenemia or genomic detection of the virus should be undertaken when clinical or biological data suggests an HIV infection in the absence of serological evidence."
33,0.005,1.0000,"We report on the frequency of genetic mutations associated with drug resistance in antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from Martinique (French West Indies), where zidovudine (ZDV) has been available since 1987 and where combination therapy developed simultaneously with its use in continental France. Genotypic resistance was studied in plasma HIV RNA from samples collected between 1988 and 1998 from 70 antiretroviral-naive study subjects, half presenting with either primary infection or documented seroconversion. A line probe assay (LIPA) was used to detect substitutions on the reverse transcriptase (RT) codons 41, 69, 70, 74, 184, and 215. Direct sequencing was used to complete the data for RT codons which were uninterpretable by LIPA. Of these patients, 17 harbored mutated viruses with one or more mutations in the RT gene codons analyzed. ZDV resistance mutations T215Y/F, M41L, and K70R were found in 2, 5, and 12 individuals, respectively. Mutant strains L74V (didanosine [ddI] and dideoxycytidine [ddC]) were detected in 3 patients and M184V (lamivudine/ddI/ddC) in 4 patients. However, pure mutant results at one or more codons of interest were observed in only 5 (7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-13%) patients, all involving ZDV resistance. One carried both mutations T215Y and M41L known to confer a high degree of phenotypic resistance to ZDV. Among a subgroup of 28 patients with a timepoint of infection after 1995, 24 [86%; approximately 95% CI, 73%-99%) presented with a wild-type pattern. The significance of the high prevalence of mixed patterns observed in drug-naive patients remains unclear. However, the frequency of primary mutant genotypes associated with high levels of drug resistance is low in Martinique and in this study we did not observe any currently increased tendency in this frequency."
6654,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was the investigation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in hemodialysis patients in order to detect HCV infection, and the determination of virus genotypes in HCV positive patients. A total of 94 patients, 44 female and 50 male (mean age: 49 +/- 17 years old), who were included in hemodialysis program between 1987-1999 (0-13 years) in the Hemodialysis Units of Gazi University, School of Medicine and Ankara Etlik Hospital of Social Insurance Society, were enrolled in the study. Anti-HCV was found positive in 41 patients (43.6%), while HCV-RNA was positive in 36 patients (38.3%). Thirty three of the patients were positive for both anti-HCV and HCV-RNA, 8 were anti-HCV positive HCV-RNA negative, and 3 were anti-HCV negative HCV-RNA positive. HCV was genotyped by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) method in 36 HCV-RNA positive patients, and 28 yielded genotype 1b, and 8 showed genotype 1a pattern. PCR products from 5'UTR of HCV-RNA isolated from two patients were also sequenced to confirm the results of RFLP study. The rate of anti-HCV and HCV-RNA positivity was detected statistically higher in patients who exposed hemodialysis longer than 24 months, and in hemodialysis patients who had blood transfusion than the other groups. As a result, our findings supported that the periodic follow-up of HCV-RNA, in addition to anti-HCV would be useful for hemodialysis patients, and genotyping of HCV for the epidemiologic data."
719,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is responsible for 4. 5% of AIDS cases in Portugal. Six HIV-2 subtypes have been described so far, subtype A being proposed as more pathogenic than the rest. The relationship between the clinical status and levels of both cellular and plasma HIV-2 viraemia is not well known, nor their modifications under antiretroviral therapy. Thirty-two consecutive HIV-2 infected persons (17 men, 15 women) attending two different hospitals in Lisbon in 1997 were enrolled prospectively in the study. All but 4 individuals most likely acquired the infection through heterosexual contact. More than half of the study population was of African origin, mainly from Guinea-Bissau. Eleven (34.4%) patients had developed clinical manifestations included within the B or C groups of the CDC classification system for HIV infection, with the rest being asymptomatic. Half of the population was undergoing antiretroviral treatment at the time of the study. HIV-2 subtypes were investigated using a new Nef-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method that allows differentiation of the main two variants, A and B. Plasma viral load was quantified using a new quantitative competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QcRT-PCR) procedure as well as the Amp-RT assay. Virus isolation was attempted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. All but one person carried HIV-2 subtype A. Plasma viraemia examined by QcRT-PCR was measurable in 15 (50%) of 30 subjects, yielding in all instances values below 20,000 HIV-2 RNA copies per ml. Plasma RT activity could be detected in only 10 (33%) of 30 subjects, a rate much lower than that seen in HIV-1 infection. Virus was isolated from 16 (53.3%) of 30 patients. A significant correlation was found between CD4+ counts, clinical status, rate of virus isolation, and plasma viral load by both QcRT-PCR and Amp-RT. In conclusion, HIV-2 subtype A is the predominant variant circulating in Portugal among both natives and immigrants. A lower cellular and plasma viral load with respect to HIV-1 was seen in persons without immunosuppression, from whom the rate of virus recovery was extremely low."
4379,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated the degree of correlation between the variation of different HIV-1 viral load measures in response to antiretroviral therapy. A quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for plasma HIV-RNA, and HIV plasma infectivity titration, were performed on prospective samples obtained from 86 antiretroviral-naive patients with symptomatic infection and CD4+ < 300/mm3, enrolled in a randomized double-blind trial of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir (SQV) in combination with zidovudine (ZDV). Subjects were stratified according to plasma virus infectivity and examined for correlations between distinct response categories with respect to CD4 count and HIV RNA copy number changes. Infectious virus could be titrated in 72% of patients at baseline. A significant reduction (< 1 log10) in HIV plasma infectivity titer was observed during the study in 69% of these patients. The reduction in plasma infectivity was a good predictor of sustained CD4+ cell increases and of sustained decrease in HIV RNA plasma copies. A decrease of at least 0.5 log10 in HIV RNA copy number was observed in 82% of the treated patients. A good correlation was found between HIV plasma infectivity titer and plasma HIV RNA copy number variations (p < 0.001). However, 10 of 17 patients with unchanged plasma infectivity titer showed a significant reduction in HIV RNA copies. While a good correlation was found between plasma infectivity and RNA plasma copies variations, only a minor correlation was found between CD4+ cell count variation and plasma infectivity titer variation. However, reduction in plasma infectivity was a very good predictor of high CD4 changes."
788,0.005,1.0000,"Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are essential components in first-line therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, long-term treatment with existing NRTIs can be associated with significant toxic side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. The identification of new NRTIs for the continued management of HIV-infected people therefore is paramount. In this report, we describe the response of a primary isolate of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) to 4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA) both in vitro and in vivo. EFdA was 3 orders of magnitude better than tenofovir (TFV), zidovudine (AZT), and emtricitabine (FTC) in blocking replication of SIV in monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro, and in a preliminary study using two SIV-infected macaques with advanced AIDS, it was highly effective at treating SIV infection and AIDS symptoms in vivo. Both animals had 3- to 4-log decreases in plasma virus burden within 1 week of EFdA therapy (0.4 mg/kg of body weight, delivered subcutaneously twice a day) that eventually became undetectable. Clinical signs of disease (diarrhea, weight loss, and poor activity) also resolved within the first month of treatment. No detectable clinical or pathological signs of drug toxicity were observed within 6 months of continuous therapy. Virus suppression was sustained until drug treatment was discontinued, at which time virus levels rebounded. Although the rebound virus contained the M184V/I mutation in the viral reverse transcriptase, EFdA was fully effective in maintaining suppression of mutant virus throughout the drug treatment period. These results suggest that expanded studies with EFdA are warranted."
86,0.005,1.0000,"Data on the clinical presentations and magnitude of tuberculosis (TB)-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection is limited. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and prevalence of TB-HIV co-infection among patients admitted at Muhimbili National Hospital between August 2008 and July 2009 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Of 387 TB patients included, 117 (30.2%) were in the age group 30-39 years. The overall mean age of patients was 38.1 years (range 8 to 86 years) and 216 (55.8%) were male. Two hundred and five (53%) had pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), 58 (15%) had extra pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) and 124 (32%) had both PTB and EPTB. Common sites of EPTB were pleural cavity 80 (44%), lymph node 31 (17%) and 30 (16.5%) abdomen. Of the 300 TB patients tested for HIV, 175 (58.3%) were HIV-infected and 97 (55.4%) of these were already on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at time of admission. Overall, 104 (26.9%) of the TB patients admitted died. About two thirds of patients who died had PTB. About three quarters (73.1%; N=283) of the patients were discharged home to continue with anti-TB treatment. There was significantly higher proportion of deaths among HIV-infected TB patients (29.1% versus 15.2%) than in the HIV uninfected TB patients (P=0.005). Age was a significant predictor for PTB (OR 0.946, 95% CI 0.917-0.976) while age (OR 1.019, 95% CI 1.002-1.036) and HIV serostatus (OR 2.143, 95% CI 1.313-3.497) were significant risk factors for EPTB. It is concluded that more than half of the patients had PTB and pleural cavity was the most common site of EPTB. TB-HIV co-infected patients had significantly higher mortality than the TB-HIV- uninfected patients. It is recommended to emphasize on the provision of HIV counselling and testing to all TB patients to ensure proper management and timely initiation of ART in TB-HIV co-infected patients in order to improve the outcome and reduce mortality."
1548,0.005,1.0000,"We sought to determine tuberculosis (TB) prevalence including multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB among a cohort of high risk patients at two directly observed treatment short course (DOTS) clinics in Delhi, India. We also aimed to compare the sensitivity of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear tests for patients with HIV using sputum cultures as the gold standard. A cross-section study was conducted among adult patients (> or = 18 years old) with prolonged cough (greater than two weeks), night sweats, fever, and/or weight loss suspected of pulmonary TB between February and March 2006. Sputum samples were obtained and processed for 165 patients; 53 (32.1%) were culture positive for TB. Patients with TB were predominantly male (92.1%), young (median age of 32 years), and the HIV-seroprevalence was high (41.5%). In the multivariable analysis adjusted for age, HIV infection was significantly associated (POR = 2.0, p < 0.05) with the presence of TB disease. Among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates recovered from 53 cases, 25 (47.2%) were resistant to > or = 1 first line anti-TB drugs and 7 (13.2%) were MDR-TB. The sensitivity of AFB smears among HIV negative and positive participants was 35.5% and 18.0%, respectively. Our findings demonstrated that the sensitivity of AFB smears to detect TB among HIV positive patients was low. Additionally, we found that even in regions where population drug resistance estimates are low, sentinel surveillance of MDR-TB in high-risk populations is useful to prioritize target groups in need of additional prevention, monitoring and health outreach."
2838,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Zimbabwe, HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) were determined in sera from 63 HCC patients using a second generation enzyme immunoassay. Anti-HCV was found in 15 patients (23.8%), 12 of whom (80%) were males. The mean ages of anti-HCV positive and anti-HCV negative patients were 62.1 (SD = 10.6) and 44.3 (SD = 15.2) years, respectively (P < 0.001). HIV antibodies were found in 17/59 patients (28.8%), 12 of whom (70.6%) were males. The mean ages of HIV positive and HIV negative patients were 39.4 (SD = 15.2) and 51.0 (SD = 15.2) years (P = 0.011). Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected in 26/61 patients (42.6%) with mean ages of HBsAg positive vs negative patients of 41.5 (SD = 15.4) years for HIV positive and 53.1 (SD = 15.1) years for HIV negative subjects (P = 0.005). Younger HCC patients had high prevalences of HBsAg and anti-HIV and a low prevalence of anti-HCV; while older patients had a high prevalence of anti-HCV and low prevalences of HBsAg and anti-HIV. This study suggested that HCV infection is probably an important aetiological agent of HCC in Zimbabwe; however, the role of HIV infection as a cause of HCC either singly or as a co-factor with hepatitis B virus infection remains speculative and warrants further study."
9491,0.005,1.0000,"The intracellular trafficking and subsequent incorporation of Gag-Pol into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) remains poorly defined. Gag-Pol is encoded by the same mRNA as Gag and is generated by ribosomal frameshifting. The multimerization of Gag and Gag-Pol is an essential step in the formation of infectious viral particles. In this study, we examined whether the interaction between Gag and Gag-Pol is initiated during protein translation in order to facilitate the trafficking and subsequent packaging of Gag-Pol into the virion. A conditional cotransfection system was developed in which virion formation required the coexpression of two HIV-1-based plasmids, one that produces both Gag and Gag-Pol and one that only produces Gag-Pol. The Gag-Pol proteins were either immunotagged with a His epitope or functionally tagged with a mutation (K65R) in reverse transcriptase that is associated with drug resistance. Gag-Pol packaging was assessed to determine whether the Gag-Pol incorporated into the virion was preferentially packaged from the plasmid that expressed both Gag and Gag-Pol or whether it could be packaged from either plasmid. Our data show that translation of Gag and Gag-Pol from the same mRNA is not critical for virion packaging of the Gag-Pol polyprotein or for viral function."
4167,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy has had a great impact on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1. However, development of drug resistance, which could be subsequently transmitted to the child, is a major concern. In Honduras and Belize the prevalence of drug resistance among HIV-1-infected children remains unknown. A total of 95 dried blood spot samples was obtained from HIV-1-infected, untreated children in Honduras and Belize born during 2001 to 2004, when preventive antiretroviral therapy was often suboptimal and consisted of monotherapy with nevirapine or zidovudine. Partial HIV-1 pol gene sequences were successfully obtained from 66 children (Honduras n=55; Belize n=11). Mutations associated with drug resistance were detected in 13% of the Honduran and 27% of the Belizean children. Most of the mutations detected in Honduras (43%) and all mutations detected in Belize were associated with resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which was expected from the wide use of nevirapine to prevent MTCT during the study period. In addition, although several mothers reported that they had not received antiretroviral therapy, mutations associated with resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors were found in Honduras. This suggests prior and unreported use of these drugs, or that these women had been infected with resistant virus. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, the presence of drug resistance-associated mutations in HIV-1-infected Honduran and Belizean children."
9558,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study is to determine whether early viral dynamics and evolution predict outcome of primary acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HCV- and human immunodeficiency virus-negative injection drug users were enrolled prospectively and followed monthly to identify acute HCV infection using RNA detection. Subjects with more than 1 month between HCV-RNA-negative and -positive visits were excluded to ensure stringent acute infection. Differences in medians of log-transformed viral RNA levels and evolutionary rates in each gene of a 5'-hemigenomic amplicon were assessed using Mann-Whitney's rank-sum test. Correlation coefficient was calculated using Spearman's rank order. Initial viremia level was 50-fold higher in subjects with spontaneous clearance (compared with persistence) of primary acute HCV infection (median, 7.1 versus 5.4 log(10)  IU/mL; P = 0.002). Initial viremia level in subjects with interleukin (IL)28B-C allele at rs12979860 and clearance was higher than that in subjects with IL28B-T allele and persistence (P = 0.001). Evolutionary rates in the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) region of the E2 gene were significantly higher in self-resolvers than those in persistence subjects during early infection, whereas other genes or regions had comparable rates. All major substitutions in HVR1 in persistence subjects were convergent changes, whereas over the same time interval clearance subjects displayed divergent evolution, indicating different immune responses between the two groups."
