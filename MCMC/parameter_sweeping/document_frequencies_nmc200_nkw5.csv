4048,0.03,6.0000,"The government of Zimbabwe began providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in public institutions in 2004. In Midlands province two clinics constituted the most active HIV care service points, with patients being followed up through a comprehensive patient monitoring and tracking system which captured specific patient variables and outcomes over time. The data from 2006 to 2011 were subjected to analysis to answer specific research questions and this case study is based on that analysis. The goal of this case study is to build participants' capacity to undertake secondary data analysis and interpretation using a dataset for HIV antiretroviral therapy in Zimbabwe and to draw conclusions which inform recommendations. Case studies in applied epidemiology allow students to practice applying epidemiologic skills in the classroom to address real-world public health problems. Case studies as a vital component of an applied epidemiology curriculum are instrumental in reinforcing principles and skills covered in lectures or in background reading. The target audience includes Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programs (FELTPs), university students, district health executives, and health information officers."
6626,0.03,6.0000,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of two-gene locus cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) +49 and CD86 +1057 were previously reported to influence the outcome of liver transplantation (LT) with respect to allograft acceptance. SNP at CTLA-4 +49 was also suggested to be associated with the individual difference in the clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, their influence on the incidence of post-LT HBV reinfection was not clear. With the increasing knowledge of costimulatory mechanisms on LT and host immune response, we designed this study to investigate the relationship between different alleles as well as genotypes at these two locations and HBV reinfection after LT."
1028,0.025,5.0000,"The purpose of the audit was to assess the implementation of the protocols developed by Lothian University National Health Service Trust for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) against blood-borne virus infections. Patients at risk of infection after an injury were referred to the Department of Genitourinary Medicine (GUM) Edinburgh Royal Infirmary for assessment. A brief description of the incident, the time of the incident, the time of referral and the decision made was documented. The notes of these patients were reviewed 12 months later for the results of prospective HIV test after each incident. There were 76 referrals to the GUM Department in year 2001. Occupational Health (OH) and the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Departments each made 35 referrals. The latter cases were exposures in community settings. Amongst A&E referrals the time interval between the incident and assessment was significantly longer than for OH referrals (P=0.001). Female health workers reported exposure incidents sooner than their male counterparts (P=0.01). Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV was offered to 22 (29%) of 76 referred individuals, and was accepted by 13 (59%) persons. The course of PEP drugs was discontinued by five (38%) of the 13 individuals after consented post-incident HIV testing of the source patients showed that they were HIV-seronegative. Five of eight individuals completed the course of PEP medication. Only 11 (14%) persons attended for serological testing for blood-borne virus infection three or more months after exposure. None of these 11 persons, one of whom had been given PEP medication, had become infected. Further training and emphasis on the necessity of immediate reporting of occupational incidents and consented post-incident HIV testing of the source patient is needed. The current guidelines appear to work fairly well, but further counselling of those with significant injuries to undertake HIV serological testing after appropriate time interval is required."
1691,0.025,5.0000,"Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) infections remain major public health issues globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Impairment of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity by HIV and/or TB infections may limit the host's defences against other pathogens, including the diarrheagenic protozoan Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia intestinalis, and Entamoeba histolytica. During September-December 2015 a cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence and molecular diversity of these enteric parasites among HIV- and/or TB-infected patients at a medical reference centre in Chowke district, southern Mozambique. A total of 99 stool specimens were initially screened by direct microscopy and further confirmed and characterised by molecular methods. DNA sequence analyses of the genes encoding the small subunit ribosomal RNA and the 60-kDa glycoprotein were used for the typing and sub-typing of Cryptosporidium isolates, respectively. G. intestinalis-positive isolates by real-time PCR were subsequently typed at the glutamate dehydrogenase locus. Differential diagnosis of E. histolytica/dispar was achieved by real-time PCR. G. intestinalis (8.1%) was the enteric protozoan more frequently detected, followed by Cryptosporidium spp. (7.1%), and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (6.1%). Two HIV-infected (but not TB-infected) patients harbour G. intestinalis and Cryptosporidium spp. co-infections. Two (29%) G. intestinalis isolates were successfully characterised, revealing the presence of known AII and novel BIV genotypes. Four (57%) Cryptosporidium isolates were unmistakeable assigned to C. hominis, identifying two (IbA10G2 and IdA22) sub-types. Cryptosporidium infections were not associated to diarrhoea in HIV-positive patients, probably because improved immune function in the affected individuals due to antiretroviral therapy. G. intestinalis was considered a non-opportunistic pathogen, whereas the presence of E. histolytica could not be confirmed by molecular methods. Based on their common presence in the studied clinical population, we recommend the effective diagnosis and treatment of these enteropathogens for improving the management of HIV and TB patients."
8908,0.025,5.0000,"Following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration into host cell DNA, the viral promoter can become transcriptionally silent in the absence of appropriate signals and factors. HIV-1 gene expression is dependent on regulatory elements contained within the long terminal repeat (LTR) that drive the synthesis of viral RNAs and proteins through interaction with multiple host and viral factors. Previous studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and Sp site III (3T, C-to-T change at position 3, and 5T, C-to-T change at position 5 of the binding site, respectively, when compared to the consensus B sequence) that are low affinity binding sites and correlate with more advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. Stably transfected cell lines containing the wild type, 3T, 5T, and 3T5T LTRs were developed utilizing bone marrow progenitor, T, and monocytic cell lines to explore the LTR phenotypes associated with these genotypic changes from an integrated chromatin-based microenvironment. Results suggest that in nonexpressing cell clones LTR-driven gene expression occurs in a SNP-specific manner in response to LTR activation or treatment with trichostatin A treatment, indicating a possible cell type and SNP-specific mechanism behind the epigenetic control of LTR activation. "
3236,0.02,4.0000,"The value of CD4 lymphocyte counts as a surrogate marker in persons with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection during antiretroviral treatment was assessed using longitudinal models and data from the Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS didanosine/zalcitabine trial of 467 HIV-infected patients. Patients with AIDS or two CD4 counts of < or = 300 who fulfilled specific criteria for zidovudine intolerance or failure were randomized to receive either 500 mg didanosine (ddl) daily or 2.25 mg zalcitabine (ddC) per day. Absolute CD4 counts were recorded at study entry and at as many as four visits. Patients were followed for clinical disease progression and survival. At 2 months, the difference in mean CD4 count from baseline was +15.4 cells/mm3 in the ddI group but -1.3 cells/mm3 in the ddC group. Patients assigned to ddI had a greater chance of a CD4 response at 2 months than those on ddC, yet only those in the ddC group with a response showed significant improvement in progression of disease or survival compared with ddC nonresponders, ddI responders, and ddI nonresponders (p = 0.03). We conclude that a CD4 response does not necessarily correlate with improved outcome and is therefore not a useful surrogate marker in these patients."
4831,0.02,4.0000,"To better understand whether potent antiretroviral therapies can modify the natural history of HIV-1-associated microsporidiosis and cryptosporidiosis, the response to antimicrobial treatment of these opportunistic infections was evaluated in patients with or without antiretroviral treatment. Fifty patients with diarrhoea, all positive for Cryptosporidium parvum or Enterocytozoon bieneusi, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected concerning demographics, clinical and microbiological characteristics of the parasitic infection, antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Faecal samples were prepared using the Richie formalin-ethyl acetate method and stained using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for detection of Cryptosporidium parvum and Isospora belli, the modified trichrome and calcofluor white technique for detection of Enterocytozoon spp., and iodine for detection of ova, cysts or vegetative forms. Diarrhoea was defined as an abnormal increase in stool liquidity, an abnormal increase in stool frequency and a daily stool weight of more than 250 g for a period of at least 4 days. Patients treated with double antiretroviral therapy or protease inhibitors demonstrated an excellent response and a sustained therapeutic effect after follow-up (range, 5-36 months). The relapse of cryptosporidiosis in two patients who discontinued antiretroviral therapy suggests that the infection might remain in a latent stage. The resolution of the diarrhoea seems to be related to an increased CD4+ cell count rather than to the viral load. In conclusion, these data strongly support the hypothesis that combination antiretroviral therapy is able to greatly modify the course of cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis in patients infected with HIV-1."
8027,0.02,4.0000,"Parasitic infections continue to take their toll on HIV positive patients by influencing the blood qualitatively and quantitatively. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in relation to anaemia and CD4 counts among HIV-infected patients in Benin City, Nigeria. Using a serial sampling method, a total of 2000 HIV-infected patients were recruited on their first visit prior to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital from August 2007 to August 2009. Stool and blood samples were collected from each patient. The stool samples were processed using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique to microscopically identify the oocysts of Cryptosporidium species, Isospora belli, Cyclospora species and spores of Microsporidium species while saline and iodine preparations were used for identifying the ova, cysts and parasites of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Taenia spp and other parasites. The blood specimens were equally analyzed using the flow cytometry for CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and autoanalyzer - sysmex kx - 21 for haemoglobin concentration. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 93.3% while 18% had parasitic infections. There was a significant relationship between CD4 count <200cells/microL and anaemia (P<0.0001). Cryptosporidium species (P= 0.005), A. lumbricoides (P=0.035), hookworm and Taenia species (P=0.014) were associated with anaemia. Anaemia was associated with CD4 count while Cryptosporidium species, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species were the intestinal parasitic agents associated with anaemia. In conclusion the prevalence of anaemia in HIV-infected patients is high low CD4 count is a significant risk factor of acquiring anaemia. Except for isosporiasis, cryptosporidiosis, A. lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species in HIV infected individuals are parasitic agents associated with anaemia. Routine screening for intestinal parasites and holistic management of anaemia is advocated."
1546,0.02,4.0000,"Genomic rearrangements in the 5' part of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) have been involved in multidrug resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTI). We carried out a retrospective, multicenter study to investigate the prevalence, variability, and phenotypic consequences of such rearrangements. Data concerning the HIV-1 RT genotype and the biological and clinical characteristics of NRTI-treated patients were collected from 10 virology laboratories. Sensitivities of the different HIV-1 variants to RT inhibitors were analyzed in a single-cycle recombinant virus assay. Fifty-two of 2,152 (2.4%) RT sequences had a rearrangement in the 5' part of the RT, with an extensive molecular variation. The number of codons inserted between positions 68 and 69 ranged from 1 (3 samples) or 2 (41 samples) to 5 and 11 in one case each. In four cases, codon 67 was deleted. High levels of phenotypic resistance to zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), abacavir (ABC), and didanosine (ddI) were found in 95, 92, 72, 62, and 15% of the 40 samples analyzed, respectively. Resistance to AZT, d4T, and ABC could be found in the absence of the T215Y/F mutations. Resistance to 3TC could develop in the absence of specific mutations. Low-level resistance to ddI was noticed in 40% of the patients. The deletions of codon 67 seemed to have little effect on NRTI sensitivity. Most of the rearrangements were shown to contribute to cross-resistance to NRTI. The results regarding susceptibility to ddI raise the question of the interpretation of the phenotypic data concerning this drug."
1434,0.02,4.0000,"Patients with resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection undergoing chemo- or immunosuppressive therapy are at potential risk for HBV reactivation. To determine whether the host immune response contributes to liver injury, we performed an immunological analysis of a patient with HBV reactivation. Consistent with the detection of HBV DNA in the sera, the number of polyclonal HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) gradually increased; however, the number of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) decreased. The interaction between HBV-specific CTLs and CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg is an important determinant of liver injury during HBV reactivation. Therefore, monitoring the number of these cells might be a useful modality for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis resulting from HBV reactivation. "
9178,0.02,4.0000,"This study aimed to determine the prevalence and species of Cryptosporidium among HIV/AIDS patients in southwest of Iran. Two hundred fifty faecal samples from HIV patients were examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts using a conventional coproscopic approach. Such oocysts were detected in 18 (7.2%) out of 250 faecal samples. Genomic DNAs from 250 samples were then subjected to a nested-PCR-RFLP technique targeting different loci of 18S rRNA gene for species identification. Out of 250 samples, 27 (10.8%) were positive for different Cryptosporidium spp; Restriction patterns resulting from the digestion of the nested amplicon with restriction endonucleases VspI and SspI showed that C. parvum (70.38%) was the most prevalent species, followed by C. hominis (25.92%) and C. meleagridis (3.7%), respectively. The mean CD4+ T-cell count was 215 cells/μL. There was a strong association between cryptosporidiosis and CD4+ T-cell count (P = 0.000) with the highest prevalence recorded among patients with CD4+ T-cell count < 200 cells/μL. This confirms that there is a low opportunity for this parasite to get established as the patients CD4+ T-cell count increases. Also HIV infection increased the risk of having Cryptosporidium. Our epidemiological findings are useful for any preventive intervention to control disease diffusion."
1145,0.02,4.0000,"Long-term medication regimen adherence is challenging in all populations, but in the HIV-infected adolescent population the frequency of poverty, homelessness, substance abuse, and mental illness make highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence even more challenging. In 2003, we developed a pilot program for HIV-infected adolescents and young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 who were either going to begin a HAART regimen for the first time or begin a new HAART regimen. Participants received a free cell phone with a local service plan for approximately 6 months. Participants received phone call reminders for 12 weeks. Call frequency was tapered at 4-week intervals. Patients were assessed at 4-week intervals to determine the perceived intrusiveness or helpfulness of receiving calls, and missed medication doses. Eight consecutive patients were recruited for the study, and five were able to complete it through the 24 weeks. Most participants found the calls to be helpful and the level of intrusion into their daily lives acceptable. Using cell phone reminders to assist patients does not require an extensive amount of daily staff time. Tapering calls rapidly over 3 months, followed by discontinuation of calls provided inadequate support for subjects, especially those with significant psychosocial issues such as substance abuse. Use of cell phone reminders to assist adolescents adhere with HIV medications was practical and acceptable to pilot study participants. Viral suppression waned for all but two patients after termination of cell phone reminders and suggests that a 12-week intervention was not adequate for most subjects. Larger prospective studies of cell phone observation of therapy will be needed to determine if this intervention can improve long-term adherence and health outcomes."
5998,0.02,4.0000,"To define factors predictive of failure to respond to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-infected subjects pretreated with zidovudine (ZDV), three groups of subjects shifted to double therapy with ZDV plus didanosine (ddI, n = 13), zalcitabine (ddC, n = 14), or lamivudine (3TC, n = 12) were retrospectively evaluated, with respect to addition of the second NRTI, at week 0 and week 24. Factors considered included duration of ZDV pretreatment, CD4+ cell counts, plasma HIV-1 RNA load, peripheral blood mononuclear cell HIV-1 DNA load, and HIV-1 DNA genotypic resistance to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. The three groups were well matched for baseline characteristics and did not differ significantly in virological and immunological response to the different combination treatments. Drug-specific resistance mutations were selected in more than half the cases by 3TC, but not by ddI and ddC. Low-level and substantial genotypic resistance to ZDV was detected 13 (33.3%) and in 19 (48.7%) patients at baseline, respectively, and evolved through week 24 in several patients. When subjects were divided into responders and nonresponders to the second nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor on the basis of a decrease of more than 0.5 log10 (n = 15) or less than 0.5 log10 (n = 21) in HIV-1 RNA, respectively, baseline genotypic ZDV resistance was the only independent predictor of failure in a logistic regression model (P = 0.003 or P = 0.024, depending on whether low-level resistance was considered or not, respectively). Thus, selection of ZDV resistance mutations may impair subsequent use of different nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor compounds."
4070,0.02,4.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease in patients on hemodialysis. As no useful noninvasive predictors of disease activity and fibrosis have been found, liver biopsy is essential in these patients to accurately assess the severity of disease and thus the prognosis and plan management. The present study was undertaken to assess the degree of severity of necroinflammatory changes and fibrosis in liver biopsies of patients on hemodialysis with chronic HCV infection. Liver biopsies obtained from 45 patients on hemodialysis with serological evidence of chronic hepatitis C were studied. The grading of necroinflammatory activity and staging of fibrosis were histologically assessed. The majority of patients (30, i.e. 66.7%) had mild disease with mild inflammatory activity and stage 0, 1 or 2 fibrosis. There was no significant correlation between the degree of fibrosis and the age of the patients (rs = 0.015), the duration of hemodialysis (rs = 0.047) or the presence of steatosis (rs = 0.064). There was a positive correlation between the presence of bile ductular proliferation and the severity of fibrosis (rs = 0.612). It was concluded that chronic HCV infection in hemodialysis patients is relatively mild early in its course. However, serial follow-up liver biopsies are mandatory to plan appropriate intervention strategies."
9671,0.02,4.0000,"Even though potent antiretrovirals are available against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, therapy fails in a significant fraction of patients. Among the most relevant reasons for treatment failure are drug toxicity and side effects, but also the development of viral resistance towards the drugs applied. Efflux by ATP-binding cassette (ABC-) transporters represents one major mechanism influencing the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs and particularly their distribution, thus modifiying the concentration within the infected cells, that is, at the site of action. Moreover, drug-drug interactions may occur at the level of these transporters and modulate their activity or expression thus influencing the efficacy and toxicity of the substrate drugs. This review summarizes current knowledge on the interaction of antiretrovirals used for HIV-1 therapy with ABC-transporters and highlights the impact of ABC-transporters for cellular resistance and therapeutic success. Moreover, the suitability of different cell models for studying the interaction of antiretrovirals with ABC-transporters is discussed."
1872,0.02,4.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy for HIV may have important economic benefits for patients and their households. We quantified the impact of HIV treatment on employment status among HIV patients in rural South Africa who were enrolled in a public-sector HIV treatment program supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. We linked clinical data from more than 2,000 patients in the treatment program with ten years of longitudinal socioeconomic data from a complete community-based population cohort of more than 30,000 adults residing in the clinical catchment area. We estimated the employment effects of HIV treatment in fixed-effects regressions. Four years after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, employment among HIV patients had recovered to about 90 percent of baseline rates observed in the same patients three to five years before they started treatment. Many patients initiated treatment early enough that they were able to avoid any loss of employment due to HIV. These results represent the first estimates of employment recovery among HIV patients in a general population, relative to the employment levels that these patients had prior to job-threatening HIV illness and the decision to seek care. There are large economic benefits to HIV treatment. For some patients, further gains could be obtained from initiating antiretroviral therapy earlier, prior to HIV-related job loss."
2362,0.02,4.0000,"New human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) diagnoses are increasing rapidly in Hebei. The aim of this study presents the most extensive HIV-1 molecular epidemiology investigation in Hebei province in China thus far. We have carried out the most extensive systematic cross-sectional study based on newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive individuals in 2013, and characterized the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequences in the whole of Hebei. Nine HIV-1 genotypes based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequence were identified among 610 newly diagnosed naïve individuals. The four main genotypes were circulating recombinant form (CRF)01_AE (53.4%), CRF07_BC (23.4%), subtype B (15.9%), and unique recombinant forms URFs (4.9%). Within 1 year, three new genotypes (subtype A1, CRF55_01B, CRF65_cpx), unknown before in Hebei, were first found among men who have sex with men (MSM). All nine genotypes were identified in the sexually contracted HIV-1 population. Among 30 URFs, six recombinant patterns were revealed, including CRF01_AE/BC (40.0%), CRF01_AE/B (23.3%), B/C (16.7%), CRF01_AE/C (13.3%), CRF01_AE/B/A2 (3.3%) and CRF01_AE/BC/A2 (3.3%), plus two potential CRFs. This study elucidated the complicated characteristics of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology in a low HIV-1 prevalence northern province of China and revealed the high level of HIV-1 genetic diversity. All nine HIV-1 genotypes circulating in Hebei have spread out of their initial risk groups into the general population through sexual contact, especially through MSM. This highlights the urgency of HIV prevention and control in China."
945,0.015,3.0000,"The growing elderly population of HIV-infected patients is leading to a significant epidemiological transition and HIV infection has been proposed as a premature and accelerated aging model rending the individual more susceptible to premature disability. However, the determinants of disability among this emergent population are still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the correlates of prevalent disability in adults ≥50 years with HIV infection. A cross-sectional study of 184 HIV-infected adults receiving ambulatory care in an HIV clinic of a tertiary care, university-affiliated hospital in Mexico City was conducted. Disability for instrumental (IADL) and basic activities of daily living (ADL) was established. Sociodemographic factors, clinical variables, current CD4(+) cell count, and HIV viral load (VL) were tested as potential determinants of disability. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the correlates of both types of disability. The mean age was 59.3 years. All participants were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Of participants 17.9% had disability for IADL and 26.1% for ADL. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that being older; having a lower CD4(+) cell count, and having a detectable HIV VL were independently associated with both types of disability. In addition, educational level was also independently associated with ADL disability. Age, educational level, low CD4(+) cell count, and detectable HIV VL were independently associated with disability. Whether effective and timely antiretroviral therapy will reduce the risk of disability in HIV-infected elderly patients needs to be evaluated. "
7770,0.015,3.0000,"Approximately 350 million people have chronic hepatitis B infection, a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients who are infected through parenteral or sexual transmission are also at risk for acquisition of HIV. Concomitant HIV infection can lead to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and HCC. This review will focus on the epidemiology, natural history and prevention of HBV infection and the modulating effect of HIV on the clinical expression of HBV disease."
5243,0.015,3.0000,"In Waorani communities of the Amazon basin of Ecuador, hepatitis B (HB) surface antigen was found in 14% of asymptomatic persons. The aim of this study was to identify the Waorani population in Ecuador and obtain an epidemiologically adequate coverage of vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) among them. Between February and September 2010, three vaccination campaigns were completed as part of a collaborative activity between the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health and the community leaders in the intervention areas. In addition, in 10 of the 22 Waorani communities, during first contact, a questionnaire about risk factors for HBV infection was administered. A total of 16 Waorani communities were registered before the beginning of this intervention, but during the actual process, six additional communities were identified. In total, 1,251 community members were registered, 92.7% of which received all three doses of the vaccine. Among them, 83% of survey respondents reported having been vaccinated, but only 22% were able to show proof. Only 1% of respondents were intravenous drug users, whereas 22% had at least one tattoo. All self-identified as heterosexual, but only 32% reported using condoms during sexual intercourse. By March 2015, no new cases of HB were been reported in any of the Waorani communities. Herein, we report the importance of intersectoral collaboration to strengthen health interventions in an isolated population like the Waorani area."
8847,0.015,3.0000,Recent studies have suggested that host genetics may be useful for predicting drug response and have supported the recommendation that single polynucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL28B should be investigated when treating hepatitis C virus (HCV)-1 infected patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether a single IL-28B genotype SNP rs8099917 or rs12979860 determination is sufficient to predict treatment failure in patients with chronic HCV.
4757,0.015,3.0000,"The impact of drug resistance mutations induced by nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NRTI) on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) recognition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain LAI (HIV-1(LAI)) RT was addressed in 35 treated or untreated patients. Two HIV-1(LAI) RT regions encompassing mutation M41L, L74V, M184V, and T215Y/F were recognized in 75 and 83% mutated and in 33 and 42% unmutated samples, respectively. A total of 41 new CTL epitopes overlapping these mutations were predicted. Mutations enhanced HLA-binding scores of 17 epitopes, decreased scores of 5, and had no effect in 19. Four predicted epitopes containing mutations 41, 74, and 184 were tested and recognized by CD8 cells from mutated or unmutated samples, with frequencies up to 270 gamma interferon spot-forming cells per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Therefore, RT mutations induced by NRTI can increase the immunogenicity of RT for CTL and might allow a better immune control of resistant viruses in vivo, suggesting that specific immune therapy might help prevent these mutations."
6893,0.015,3.0000,"Lamivudine is a major drug approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Emergence of drug-resistant mutants with amino acid substitutions in the YMDD motif is a well-documented problem during long-term lamivudine therapy. Here we report a novel lamivudine-resistant strain of HBV with an intact YMDD motif, which included an amino acid substitution, rtA181T, in the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of HBV polymerase. The substitution also induced a unique amino acid substitution (W172L) in the overlapping hepatitis B surface (HBs) protein. The YMDD mutant strains were not detected even by using the sensitive peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR clamping method. The detected nucleotide substitution was accompanied by the emergence of an additional nucleotide substitution that induced amino acid change (S331C) in the spacer domain. The rtA181T mutant strain displayed a threefold decrease in susceptibility to lamivudine in in vitro experiments in comparison with the wild type. In vivo analysis using human hepatocyte-chimeric mice confirmed the resistance of this mutant strain to lamivudine. We developed a method to detect this novel rtA181T mutation and a previously reported rtA181T mutation with the HBs stop codon using restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR and identified one patient with the latter pattern among 40 patients with lamivudine resistance. In conclusion, although the incidence is not high, we have to be careful regarding the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutant strains with intact YMDD motif."
6040,0.015,3.0000,"Health care personnel are at high risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission. The aim of the present study was to investigate hepatitis B (HB) knowledge and vaccination acceptance among health care personnel in southwestern Greece, using the Hepatitis B Vaccine Knowledge and Acceptance Questionnaire. One hundred eighty-three employees participated (71 males). Occupation (p < .001), higher education (p < .001), and vaccination (p = .007) were significantly related to HB knowledge. The rate of HBV vaccination coverage was 70.9%. Participants considering themselves at high risk for HBV infection did not report significantly increased vaccination rates. In the multivariate analysis, university personnel (p = .002), occupational category (p < .001), and HB knowledge (p = .049) were significantly associated with vaccination. In conclusion, 29% of hospital personnel were not vaccinated mainly due to negligence. Occupation, education, and knowledge about HB seem to be associated with HBV vaccination."
9482,0.015,3.0000,"In the past few years there has been increasing concern about the transmission of drug-resistant HIV. This study aimed to describe the frequency of primary mutations associated with HIV-1 drug resistance and the prevalence of genetic HIV subtypes in a population of vertically infected children before the initiation of HAART. At the time of genotypic testing, the median age was 6.0 years (IQR 25-75%: 3.8-9.2) and the median age at admission was 3.84 years (IQR 25-75%: 1.23-6.11). Antepartum maternal ARV exposure for PMTCT occurred for three (7.3%) mothers. According to the WHO criteria, primary ARV resistance mutations were detected in four out of 41 (9.8%) children. Subtype B was the most prevalent (63.4%). The relatively high prevalence of primary HIV-1 DRMs in this cohort of perinatally infected children in Brazil supports the local recommendation to perform resistance testing in all newly diagnosed children, regardless of age at diagnosis and antenatal ARV exposure."
7362,0.015,3.0000,"Providers are central to effective implementation of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Primary care providers (PCP) and infectious disease physicians (ID) in the US Air Force (USAF) participated in a cross-sectional survey regarding knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward HIV PrEP. Characteristics associated with PrEP knowledge were assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses.Among 403 (40% of 1015 providers) participants, 9% (PCP 383, ID 20) ever prescribed PrEP. In univariate analysis, years in practice, number of HIV-infected patients treated in the past 12 months, past prescription of antiretrovirals for HIV prevention, frequency of prescribing PrEP in the past 12 months, and ever being questioned by a patient about PrEP were associated with PrEP knowledge (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, providers who had ever prescribed antiretrovirals to prevent HIV (AOR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.27-4.42) had greater odds of high PrEP knowledge. Despite concerns about medication side effects (overall 67%: PCP 68%, ID 85%) and prescribing PrEP without clear evidence (overall 60%: PCP 65%, ID 62%), 64% (PCP 65%, ID 85%) of participants indicated PrEP should be offered in the Military Health System and 68% (PCP 70%, ID 100%) disagreed with the statement that their patient population was not at risk for HIV infection.Successful PrEP implementation in the USAF will require continued education and training of primary care providers to improve knowledge and mitigate concerns about PrEP.

8754,0.015,3.0000,"We examined 28 children with HIV-1 infection who were not responding to existing antiviral regimens and were enrolled into clinical trials conducted at the National Cancer Institute to receive salvage therapy. In 3 of the 28 patients (10.7%), the Q151M complex amino acid substitutions were identified. The three patients had received nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) monotherapy and/or combination regimens with multiple NRTIs for 4.3-8.6 years prior to the study. Recombinant infectious clones generated by incorporating the RT-encoding region of HIV-1 isolated from patients' plasma samples were highly resistant to zidovudine, didanosine and stavudine, while they were moderately resistant to lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TDF-containing regimens reduced HIV-1 viremia in two of the three children carrying the Q151M complex. These data suggest that the Q151M could be prevalent in pediatric patients with long-term NRTI monotherapy and/or dual NRTI regimens and that HAART regimens containing TDF may be meritorious in such patients."
5074,0.015,3.0000,"HIV-1 resistance mutations to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, NRTI; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, NNRTI; and protease inhibitors, PI) represent a challenge for sustainable virologic and immunologic responses. HIV-1 phylogenetic diversity and ARV resistance mutations associated with protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) were assessed among 48 ARV-experienced patients from Goiania/Goias, central west Brazil. The gp41 resistance mutations to the fusion inhibitor (T-20) were analyzed among multidrug-resistant (MDR) patients. PR, partial RT, and gp41 genes were amplified and sequenced from plasma RNA. HIV-1 subtype was assigned by phylogenetic analysis. ARV mutations in PR/RT were analyzed by the Stanford Database. T-20 resistance mutations in gp41 were identified by Stanford, the Los Alamos Database, and other sources. Subtype B represented 79.2% (38/48), subtype F1 4.2% (2/48), subtype C 2.1% (1/48), F1(PR)/B(RT) 8.3% (4/48), and B(PR)/F1(RT) 6.3% (3/48). Secondary drug resistance was observed in 79% (38/48): NRTI resistance (n = 1), NNRTI resistance (n = 1), PI + NRTI or NRTI + NNRTI resistance (n = 20), and PI + NRTI +NNRTI resistance, considered MDR (n = 16). Almost half of the MDR patients had viral loads below 10,000 copies/ml. The gp41 sequences from 14 MDR revealed one F1(PR)/B(RT)/F1(ENV) recombinant and 13 subtype B(PR)/B(RT)/B(ENV) isolates. G36E, N42T, and N43S T-20 resistance mutations were observed in three MDR patients, two of them previously treated with T-20 and the other who had never used T-20. Our data among ARV-experienced patients showed a high proportion of drug-resistance mutations and MDR. T-20 resistance mutations were detected among MDR patients corroborating the importance of T-20 genotyping for clinical management and salvage therapy."
4418,0.015,3.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly reduced the risk of early death from opportunistic infections and extended the lifespan of people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Thus, many complications and organic damage in the HIV-infected population emerge. Cardiovascular disease as coronary artery disease has become a matter of particular concern. Its incidence is greatly increased in the HIV-infected population over that of people of the same age in the absence of general cardiovascular risk factors. Despite several clinical and laboratory studies in the association between HIV infection and cardiovascular disease, the pathogenic mechanisms of this significant clinical problem are largely unknown and are now under active investigation. Endothelial dysfunction is possibly the most plausible link between HIV infection and atherosclerosis. Increased expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and endothelial adhesion molecule (E-selectin) and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL-6 has been reported in HIV-positive patients. The effect of HAART on endothelial function in HIV-positive patients is also demonstrated. In this review, we focus on the recent research update of HIV-associated vascular disease and vascular injury. We analyze and discuss the recent clinical and laboratory investigations on the effect of HIV, viral protein, and HAART therapy on endothelial injury and vascular disease; identify the areas of controversy and clinical relevance; and suggest some directions for future research."
3307,0.015,3.0000,"During the last 5 years, considerable scientific and financial efforts have been made in the development of quantitative nucleic acid detection technology. For detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), quantitative culture is time consuming, cumbersome and requires appropriate laboratory safety equipment. Quantitative determination of p24 antigen by enzyme immunoassay is of limited value due to its relatively poor sensitivity. Therefore, quantitative determination of viral load using nucleic acid amplification techniques is the most accurate, prognostic marker for HIV type 1 infection, independently of the CD4+ cell count. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is not cultivable in vitro. Serological assays allow an accurate diagnosis and follow-up of acute or chronic infection. Quantification of HBV DNA is used for the monitoring of antiviral therapy, determination of infectivity and for resolution of unclear serological profiles, e.g. isolated anti-HBc reactivity, as well as for patients in which HBV mutants are suspected. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can only be detected by molecular based assays because no cell culture system, which permits a reliable isolation of clinical specimens, is currently available. Furthermore, early diagnosis and follow-up of infection cannot be achieved with antibody serology. The prognostic relevance of quantitative HCV RNA determination is of limited value for the long-term prognosis of chronic hepatitis C. However, viral load may predict the outcome of antiviral therapy. Genetic diversity is another challenge for HCV RNA quantification."

This, combined with effective HIV treatment which has significantly prolonged life expectancy, means that health care professionals working in the UK can expect to see increasing numbers of older people with HIV infection. In this review article, we summarise the epidemiology of HIV amongst older people, including data from our local cohort in the city of Sheffield, UK. We discuss specific and practical issues in older patients including why older people are at risk, how to make a diagnosis and the importance of doing so early, guidelines for HIV testing and an update on anti-retroviral therapy including drug interactions and side effects."

As with other parts of the world, the HIV epidemic in Asia impacts mainly on men who have sex with men, one of the at-risk populations for sexually transmitted viral hepatitis. With the increasing availability of effective antiretroviral therapy, HIV-related mortality of people living with HIV has markedly reduced. Liver disease has become an important cause of mortality and morbidity in the HIV-infected population. With the improvement of socioeconomic conditions and availability of healthcare in Asian countries in recent years, the epidemiology of sexually transmitted viral hepatitis among HIV-positive men who have sex with men has also evolved. This review updates the epidemiology of different types of sexually transmitted viral hepatitis in this defined population in Asia. "
7777,0.015,3.0000,"CCR5 is an important chemokine receptor involved in the recruitment of specific anti-viral immune cells (e.g., NK cells and T cytotoxic cells) to the liver. Previous studies indicated that the Δ 32 mutation in CCR5 gene led to inactivation of CCR5. Several conflicting studies have suggested that this mutation may be associated with either recovery or persistence of HBV infection. The main purpose of this study was to compare the frequency of the Δ 32 mutation within the CCR5 gene in a group of patients infected chronically with HBV with healthy individuals from South-East of Iran. Sixty patients with chronic HBV infection as well as 300 age-, and sex-match healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Gap-PCR was applied to determine the frequency of CCR5 Δ 32 mutation in both groups. The results demonstrated that none of the patients infected with HBV carried the CCR5 Δ 32 mutation while, 3 (1%) of the healthy individuals were found to be heterozygotic for this mutation. The CCR5 Δ 32 mutation is not a prevalent mutation in either the patients infected chronically with HBV or their health counterparts in the South-East region of Iran. This may be attributed to either different genetic settings of the investigated population or lack of any significant correlation between this mutation and HBV pathogenicity."
3675,0.015,3.0000,"Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is associated with a higher prevalence of insulin resistance compared to the general population. This finding is associated with hepatic steatosis, increased liver fibrosis and lower rates of sustained virological response to interferon based therapy. The relationship of insulin resistance and HCV genotype is controversial. Our aim was to compare the prevalence of insulin resistance between patients with HCV genotype 1 and 3. The association of insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis was also investigated."
9923,0.015,3.0000,"The recent expansion of antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage in middle/low-income countries has been associated with increasing prevalence of HIV pre-ART drug resistance (PDR). We assessed PDR prevalence, patterns, and trends in Guatemala. Blood samples from 1,084 ART-naive individuals, enrolled from October 2010 to December 2013 at the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala City, were obtained. PDR was evaluated using the WHO mutation list for transmitted drug resistance (TDR) surveillance. An overall PDR prevalence of 7.3% (95% CI 5.8-9.0%) was observed for the whole study period. TDR to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) was the highest (4.9%, p<0.001), followed by nucleoside RT inhibitors (1.8%) and protease inhibitors (1.0%). No significant trends in PDR prevalence were observed during the study period. However, higher NNRTI PDR levels were found in individuals with >500 and 350-500 CD4(+) T cells/μl (7.4% and 8.7%, respectively) compared to individuals with <350 CD4(+) T cells/μl (3.7%; p=0.039 and p=0.007, respectively), as well as a tendency of higher levels of NNRTI transmitted drug resistance (DR) in individuals with recent infection determined by HIV incidence tests (9.7%), suggesting increasing trends in time. Clusters of viruses with NNRTI PDR suggesting complex transmission networks were observed. No associations between PDR and demographic variables were found. PDR in Guatemala remains at an intermediate level. Nevertheless, we have shown evidence suggesting increasing trends in NNRTI PDR, which need to be taken into account in national HIV management policies."
2063,0.015,3.0000,"Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) is a critical mediator of immunity to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Although IFN has been used in the treatment of viral hepatitis for more than a decade, the role of IFN-alpha-receptor in HBV infection has not been intensively studied. We have evaluated the impact of two variants of the IFNAR1 gene on the outcome of HBV infection. Four hundred and fifty eight HBV-infected Vietnamese patients, with well-characterised clinical profiles including all forms of hepatic disease, and 160 non-infected, healthy Vietnamese individuals were enrolled in the study. Of these patients, 54 had acute hepatitis B, 88 had chronic hepatitis B, 118 had liver cirrhosis, 146 had a hepatocellular carcinoma and 52 were asymptomatic carriers of HBV. We analysed two SNPs for unequal distribution between these groups. The first SNP, rs1012335 is situated in intron 3 of the interferon alpha receptor 1 (IFNAR1). A C at position 17470 in the IFNAR1 on both chromosomes was detected more frequently in HBV-infected patients compared to healthy controls (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.46-4.72, p < 0.001). The same homozygosity is also associated with higher concentrations of AST and ALT (aspartate and alanine amino-transferase) in the plasma of the patients. The second SNP (rs2257167) is situated in exon 4, causing a change of amino acids from Val (GTT) to Leu (CTT). Subjects having GTT on both chromosomes were more frequent in the healthy control group (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.35-0.84, p = 0.004) and had lower plasma ALT concentrations. The findings indicate that two variants of the IFNAR1 gene are associated with the clinical presentation of HBV infection."
2626,0.015,3.0000,"We have studied the roles of immunoprophylaxis, patient selection policy and coexistent hepatitis D virus infection in the outcome of 56 HBsAg-positive elective liver transplant recipients. Twenty-nine unselected patients not treated with immunoprophylaxis formed group 1 and were compared to a recent consecutive series of 27 patients (group 2) in whom pre-transplant serological status was determined and who received immunoprophylaxis. One-year actuarial HBsAg serological recurrence rates were 48% in group 2 and 90% in group 1 with particular improvement in recipients who were either HBV DNA-negative or who had co-existent hepatitis delta virus infection. One-year patient survival has improved from 62% in group 1 to 86% in group 2 with improvements in hepatitis delta virus-negative and replicating recipients. Patients who have either co-existent hepatitis delta virus infection or are in group 2 have 1-year survival rates comparable to elective HBsAg-negative recipients (19/21 (90%), 22/27 (86%) vs 87%, respectively). In the event of recurrence, severe graft injury is diminished in recent patients and in those with coexistent delta infection who also have lower levels of circulating HBV DNA. Retransplantation for associated graft injury has a poor prognosis irrespective of administration of immunoprophylaxis. In elective liver recipients, immunoprophylaxis and/or hepatitis delta virus infection modulate hepatitis B virus recurrence and associated graft injury with consequent improvement in patient survival."
5673,0.015,3.0000,"Initiation of efavirenz-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is associated with Vitamin D deficiency, but the risk factors including efavirenz pharmacokinetics for cART-induced severe vitamin D deficiency (SVDD) and the impact of anti-tuberculosis (TB) cotreatment are not explored. We investigated the prevalence of SVDD in HIV and TB-HIV coinfected patients and associated risk factors for treatment-induced SVDD.Treatment-naïve Ethiopian HIV patients with (n = 102) or without (n = 89) TB co-infection were enrolled prospectively and received efavirenz-based cART. In TB-HIV coinfected patients, rifampicin-based anti-TB treatment was initiated 4 or 8 weeks before starting cART. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D), cholesterol and 4-beta hydroxycholesterol concentrations were measured at baseline, 4, 16, and 48 week of cART. Plasma efavirenz concentrations were determined at 4 and 16 weeks of cART.TB-HIV patients had significantly lower plasma 25 (OH)D3 levels than HIV-only patients at baseline. TB co-infection, low Karnofsky score, high viral load, and high CYP3A activity as measured by plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratios were significant predictors of low 25 (OH)D3 levels at baseline. In HIV-only patients, initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVVD from 27% at baseline to 76%, 79%, and 43% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively. The median 25 (OH)D3 levels declined from baseline by -40%, -50%, and -14% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively.In TB-HIV patients, previous anti-TB therapy had no influence on 25 (OH)D3 levels, but the initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVDD from 57% at baseline to 70% and 72% at the 4 and 16 weeks of cART, respectively. Median plasma 25 (OH)D3 declined from baseline by -17% and -21% at week 4 and 16 of cART, respectively.Our results indicate low plasma cholesterol, high CYP3A activity, and high plasma efavirenz concentrations as significant predictors of early efavirenz-based cART-induced vitamin D deficiency. Low plasma 25 (OH)D3 level at baseline is associated with TB co-infection and HIV diseases progression. Initiation of efavirenz-based cART is associated with high incidence of SVDD, whereas rifampicin based anti-TB therapy co-treatment has no significant effect. Supplementary vitamin D during cART initiation may be beneficial for HIV patients regardless of TB coinfection. "
4102,0.015,3.0000,"Viral mutations have been implicated in alteration of the biological phenotype of hepatitis B virus (HBV). We recently cloned and sequenced the viral genome of an HBV strain associated with an outbreak of fulminant hepatitis (FH strain). The FH strain contained numerous mutations in all genomic regions and was functionally characterized by a more efficient encapsidation of pregenomic RNA leading to highly enhanced replication. To define the responsible mutation(s) for the enhanced replication, we introduced individual mutations of the FH strain into a wild-type construct by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of viral replication showed that two adjacent mutations in the HBV core promotor (C to T at nucleotide 1768 and T to A at nucleotide 1770) led to high level replication. Similar to the FH strain, this mutant displayed the phenotype of enhanced encapsidation of pregenomic RNA. Functional studies in an encapsidation assay demonstrated that the identified mutations resulted in a minor increase of pregenomic RNA transcription (two- to threefold) and a major transcription-independent enhancement (> 10-fold) of viral encapsidation. Our results demonstrate that the two adjacent mutations in the HBV core promotor region are responsible for the enhanced replication of the FH strain. These two mutations, outside the previously described encapsidation signal, core, and polymerase polypeptides, appeared to affect a novel genetic element involved in viral encapsidation."
9961,0.015,3.0000,"Studies published before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have tracked the incidence and course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in relation to cardiac disease.The introduction of HAART regimens, by preventing opportunistic infections and reducing the incidence of myocarditis, has reduced the prevalence of HIV-associated cardiomyopathy of about 30% and the prevalence of cardiac involvement of AIDS-associated malignancies of about 50%. However, HAART regimens, especially those including protease inhibitors have been shown to cause, in a high proportion of HIV-infected patients, a metabolic syndrome (lipodystrophy/lipoatrophy, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance) that may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (approximately 1.4 cardiac events per 1000 years of therapy according to the Framingham score). A careful stratification of the cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular monitoring of patients under HAART according to the most recent clinical guidelines is needed."
8217,0.015,3.0000,The epidemiology of mucosal candidal colonization and candidiasis was studied in a multicenter cohort of 871 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and 439 demographically and behaviorally similar HIV-seronegative women. Cross-sectional analyses at baseline revealed that oropharyngeal colonization with Candida species was more prevalent among seropositive women and among women reporting recent cigarette smoking and injection drug use. Oropharyngeal candidiasis was also more prevalent among seropositive women. Both oropharyngeal colonization and candidiasis were significantly associated with a lower median CD4 lymphocyte count among seropositive women. Vaginal candidal colonization was more prevalent among seropositive women and among those reporting recent injection drug use and current insulin or oral antihyperglycemic therapy. Vaginal candidiasis was equally likely to be diagnosed in seropositive and seronegative women and was not significantly related to recent sexual contact. Neither vaginal colonization nor candidiasis was significantly related to a lower median CD4 lymphocyte count among seropositive women. Baseline evaluation indicated differences in the epidemiology of oropharyngeal and vaginal candidal colonization and candidiasis in HIV-seropositive women and suggested possible variation in pathogenesis of candidal infection at these two mucosal sites.
9053,0.015,3.0000,"The impact of antiretroviral drug exposure and associated lipodystrophy and/or insulin resistance (IR) on advanced liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is not fully documented. We determined the prevalence of advanced liver fibrosis (defined by hepatic stiffness ≥9.5 kPa) and associated factors, focusing on the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy and its major adverse effects (lipodystrophy and IR), in 671 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients included in the ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort. One hundred ninety patients (28.3%) had advanced liver fibrosis. In univariate analysis, advanced liver fibrosis was significantly associated with male sex, higher body mass index, HCV infection through intravenous drug use, a lower absolute CD4 cell count, a longer history of antiretroviral treatment, longer durations of protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and NRTI exposure, lipodystrophy, diabetes, and a high homeostasis model assessment method (HOMA) value. The only antiretroviral drugs associated with advanced liver fibrosis were efavirenz, stavudine and didanosine. In multivariate analysis, male sex (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.5; P = 0.018), HCV infection through intravenous drug use (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6; P = 0.018), lipodystrophy (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.3; P = 0.01), median didanosine exposure longer than 5 months (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.8; P = 0.04) and a high HOMA value (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2; P = 0.005) remained significantly associated with advanced liver fibrosis. Mitochondrial toxicity and IR thus appear to play a key role in liver damage associated with HIV/HCV-coinfection, and this should be taken into account when selecting and optimizing antiretroviral therapy. Antiretroviral drugs with strong mitochondrial toxicity (e.g. didanosine) or a major effect on glucose metabolism should be avoided."
1820,0.015,3.0000,"One key step of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the integration of its viral cDNA. This process is mediated through complex networks of host-virus interactions that alter several normal cell functions of the host. To study the complexity of disturbances in cell gene expression networks by HIV-1 integration, we constructed a network of human macrophage genes located close to chromatin regions rich in proviruses. To perform the network analysis, we selected 28 genes previously identified as the target of cDNA integration and their transcriptional profiles were obtained from GEO Profiles (NCBI). A total of 2770 interactions among the 28 genes located around the HIV-1 proviruses in human macrophages formed a highly dense main network connected to five sub-networks. The overall network was significantly enriched by genes associated with signal transduction, cellular communication and regulatory processes. To simulate the effects of HIV-1 integration in infected macrophages, five genes with the most number of interaction in the normal network were turned off by putting in zero the correspondent expression values. The HIV-1 infected network showed changes in its topology and alteration in the macrophage functions reflected in a re-programming of biosynthetic and general metabolic process. Understanding the complex virus-host interactions that occur during HIV-1 integration, may provided valuable genomic information to develop new antiviral treatments focusing on the management of some specific gene expression networks associated with viral integration. This is the first gene network which describes the human macrophages genes interactions related with HIV-1 integration."

Adherence to antiviral therapies is imperative to achieve and maintain viral suppression. To date, there has been limited research on adherence to HBV therapies. Our study aimed to explore factors influencing adherence to antiviral therapy. A total of 29 participants consented to in-depth qualitative interviews at three outpatient clinics in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were initially classified as adherent or nonadherent and thematic analysis was used to identify dominant themes. Adherent behavior was reported by 59% (n = 17) of participants. Several themes influenced adherence including routine, fear of HBV-related disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, and forgetfulness. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to explore adherence to HBV antiviral therapy. An interplay of several dominant themes emerged from our data including fear of chronic HBV disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, routine, and forgetfulness. Study findings have the potential to change nursing clinical practice, especially the way nurses and other clinicians target key HBV treatment messages and education, while monitoring adherence."

We retrospectively evaluated the impact of IL28B SNPs and other factors on SVR in a cohort of 102 HIV-1/HCV-coinfected patients treated with pegylated interferon-? (peg-INF?) and ribavirin. Data on baseline features and virological response at different time-points were collected. Overall, 89/102 patients (87%) were males, 44 (43%) of whom infected with HCV genotype 1; SVR was achieved by 50 patients (49%). A univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that rs129679860 SNP genotype CC (p<0.034), rs8099917 SNP genotype TT (p<0.01), HCV genotype 2 or 3 (p<0.0001), low HCV viral load (p<0.028) and RVR (rapid virological response) (p<0.0001) were associated with a higher likelihood of SVR. Multivariate analysis confirmed only RVR and HCV genotype as independent predictors of SVR. In a real life setting, the importance of RVR and IL28B SNPs was confirmed as predictive of SVR to identify patients with a higher likelihood of SVR to Peg-INF?+RBV, and also to designate a deferred therapy for patients with a low likelihood of SVR for whom it is preferable to wait for more successful options.

Socio-demographics, substance use and clinical correlates of antiretroviral therapy non-adherence were studied in 100 HIV-1 infected drug users receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months in Hanoi, Vietnam. All study participants were men with a mean age of 29.9 ± 4.9 years. The median duration on antiretroviral therapy was 16.2 ± 12.7 months; 83% reported 'very good' or 'perfect' adherence in the past 30 days on a subjective one-item Likert scale at time of study enrollment; 48% of participants reported drug use within the previous 6 months, with 22% reporting current drug use. Injection drug use with or without non-injection drug use in the past 6 months (95% C.I. 2.19, 1.30-3.69) and years on antiretroviral therapy (95% C.I. 1.43, 1.14-1.78) were correlated with suboptimal adherence. These findings support Vietnam's ongoing scale-up of harm reduction programmes for injection drug users and their integration with antiretroviral therapy delivery. Moreover, results highlight the need to identify and implement new ways to support high levels of antiretroviral therapy adherence as duration on antiretroviral therapy increases. "
6581,0.015,3.0000,"Vitamin D regulates bone metabolism but has also immunoregulatory properties. In HIV-infected patients bone disorders are increasingly observed. Furthermore, low 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) levels have been associated with low CD4(+) counts, immunological hyperactivity, and AIDS progression rates. Few studies have examined the vitamin D status in HIV-infected patients. This study will specifically focus on the effects of antiretroviral agents on vitamin D status. Furthermore, the effect of vitamin D status on CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART will be evaluated. Among 252 included patients the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<35 nmol/liter from April to September and <25 nmol/liter from October to March) was 29%. Female sex, younger age, dark skin, and NNRTI treatment were significant risk factors in univariate analysis, although in multivariate analyses skin pigmentation remained the only independent risk factor. Median 25(OH)D(3) levels were significantly lower in white NNRTI-treated patients [54.5(27.9-73.8) nmol/liter] compared to white PI-treated patients [77.3 (46.6-100.0) nmol/liter, p = 0.007], while among nonwhites no difference was observed. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients had significantly higher blood PTH levels than patients without treatment. Moreover, NNRTI treatment puts patients at risk of elevated PTH levels (>6.5 pmol/liter). Linear regression analysis showed that vitamin D status did not affect CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART. In conclusion, 29% of the HIV-1-infected patients had vitamin D deficiency, with skin color as an independent risk factor. NNRTI treatment may add more risk for vitamin D deficiency. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients showed higher PTH levels and might therefore be at risk of bone problems. Evaluation of 25(OH)D(3) and PTH levels, especially in NNRTI-treated and dark skinned HIV-1-infected patients, is necessary to detect and treat vitamin D deficiency early."
2398,0.015,3.0000,"In the current study we investigated the prevalence of the TNF-α 238G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the TNF-α gene in the development of lipodystrophy among HIV-1 infected individuals who had been receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the immunodeficiency clinics of the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) at Pune, India. We assessed the association of this SNP with the development of lipoatrophy/dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in these patients and measured carotid intima thickening which is a surrogate marker for chronic cardiac morbidity. Our results show that the incidence of the TNF-α 238G/A SNP is ~ two fold higher in patients with lipodystrophy as compared to those without lipodystrophy. Patients with lipodystrophy demonstrated a higher likelihood of the development of metabolic syndrome as evident by increased insulin sensitivity and increased percentage (%) β cell function. Further, a significant increase in left carotid intima thickness was observed in patients with lipodystrophy. Our study validates the association of the TNF-α 238G/A SNP allelic variant with the development of HIV- lipodystrophy via the modulation of TNF-α production, which contributes to dyslipidemia, increased lipolysis, increased insulin resistance, altered differentiation of adipocytes and increased carotid intima thickness. The contribution of genetic determinants such as the TNF-α 238G/A SNP to lipodystrophy, may provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie this disease condition and may be useful in the future for personalized therapy. Additionally, these findings will be useful in monitoring chronic cardiac morbidities among HIV infected individuals who express this SNP. "
5346,0.015,3.0000,"As a concentrated epidemic, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is spreading rapidly in one or more groups in Iran, but in the general population its prevalence is relatively low. Female sex workers (FSWs) and their partners are at greater risk for HIV infection. To determine the prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including gonorrhoea, Chlamydia, herpes simplex type 2 and syphilis among FSWs. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 278 FSWs in Shiraz, by using respondent-driven sampling, from June to March 2010. The recruitment chain started with 14 seeds, and FSWs were tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex type 2, gonorrhoea and Chlamydia. HIV prevalence was 4.7% (13/278); the most prevalent STI was herpes simplex type 2, 9.7% (27/278), followed by Chlamydia 9% (25/278), gonorrhoea 1.4% (4/278) and syphilis (0/278). The FSWs reported drug use (69.9%) of which 16.4% had history of injecting drug use. Unprotected sex in the past month was reported by 24.4% of FSWs. Urgent education and risk reduction programmes are needed in this population. "

Nevertheless, as a result of not only the deleterious effects of the virus itself and prolonged ART, but also the effects of aging, cardiovascular diseases have emerged as one of the most common causes of death among these patients."
7281,0.01,2.0000,"Increasing evidence supports a parallel between HIV-1 infection and immune aging, which is particularly apparent with common changes in naive versus memory T-cell proportions. Here, we aimed at refining the value of common T-cell-associated markers of immunosenescence during HIV disease progression or aging, and at exploring further the impact in this context of old age as well as cytomegalovirus (CMV) co-infection, which is predominant in HIV-1-infected individuals."
4699,0.01,2.0000,"During the earlier years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, initial reports described sensorineural hearing loss in up to 49% of individuals with HIV/AIDS. During those years, patients commonly progressed to advanced stages of HIV disease and frequently had neurological complications. However, the abnormalities on pure-tone audiometry and brainstem-evoked responses outlined in small studies were not always consistently correlated with advanced stages of HIV/AIDS. Moreover, these studies could not exclude the confounding effect of concurrent opportunistic infections and syphilis. Additional reports also have indicated that some antiretroviral medications may be ototoxic; thus, it has been difficult to make conclusions regarding the cause of changes in hearing function in HIV-infected patients. More recently, accelerated aging has been suggested as a potential explanation for the disproportionate increase in complications of aging described in many HIV-infected patients; hence, accelerated aging-associated hearing loss may also be playing a role in these patients."
5827,0.01,2.0000,"A patient with HIV infection who experienced immune reconstitution after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [increase in CD4 T cell count from <1/microl to >600/microl] presented with severe Graves' disease 32 months after commencing HAART. A comprehensive clinical and laboratory study demonstrated pronounced regional lymphadenopathy and thymic enlargement at presentation, and that the onset of thyrotropin receptor antibody production was associated with increased production of soluble CD30 (a marker of type 2 immune responses). Blood naive CD8 T cell counts and TREC levels in both CD4 and CD8 T cells were increased at multiple time points compared with carefully selected controls. We conclude that the Graves' disease in this patient was associated with abnormally high blood counts of thymus-derived T cells, and propose that Graves' disease after HAART in this and other HIV patients may result from failure to delete autoreactive T cell clones in the regenerating thymus."
7631,0.01,2.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) represents one of the strongest predictors of progression to AIDS, yet it is difficult for most patients to sustain high levels of adherence. This study compares the efficacy of a personalized cell phone reminder system (ARemind) in enhancing adherence to ART versus a beeper. Twenty-three HIV-infected subjects on ART with self-reported adherence less than 85% were randomized to a cellular phone (CP) or beeper (BP). CP subjects received personalized text messages daily; in contrast, BP subjects received a reminder beep at the time of dosing. Interviews were scheduled at weeks 3 and 6. Adherence to ART was measured by self-report (SR, 7-day recall), pill count (PC, past 30 days at baseline, then past 3 weeks), Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS; cumulatively at 3 and 6 weeks), and via a composite adherence score constructed by combining MEMS, pill count, and self report. A mixed effects model adjusting for baseline adherence was used to compare adherence rates between the intervention groups at 3 and 6 weeks. Nineteen subjects completed all visits, 10 men and 9 females. The mean age was 42.7 ± 6.5 years, 37% of subjects were Caucasian and 89% acquired HIV heterosexually. The average adherence to ART was 79% by SR and 65% by PC at baseline in both arms; over 6 weeks adherence increased and remained significantly higher in the ARemind group using multiple measures of adherence. A larger and longer prospective study is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand optimal reminder messages and user fatigue."
436,0.01,2.0000,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally occurring free radical with many functions. The oxidized form of NO, the nitrosonium ion, reacts with the thiol group of cysteine residues resulting in their modification to S-nitrosothiols. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (HIV-PR) has two cysteine residues that are conserved amongst different viral isolates found in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In an active dimer, these residues are located near the surface of the protease. We have found that treatment of HIV-PR with different NO congeners results in loss of its proteolytic activity and simultaneous formation of S-nitrosothiols. Sodium nitroprusside inhibited HIV-PR up to 70% and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine completely inhibited the protease within 5 min of treatment. The pattern of inhibition by NO donors is comparable to its inhibition by N-acetyl pepstatin. Using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, we identified the modification of HIV-PR by NO as that of S-nitrosation. Our findings point towards a possible role of NO in mediating resistance to HIV-1 infection."
6652,0.01,2.0000,"The intermediate filament proteins vimentin, desmin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein are cleaved in vitro by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease (HIV-1 PR). Microsequencing showed that HIV-1 PR cleaved both human and murine vimentin between leucine-422 and arginine-423 within the sequence between positions 418 and 427, Ser-Ser-Leu-Asn-Leu/Arg-Glu-Thr-Asn-Leu (SSLNL/RETNL). Minor cleavages at other sites were also observed. Heat-denatured vimentin was cleaved by HIV-1 PR less efficiently than native vimentin. A decapeptide containing the sequence SSLN-LRETNL was also cleaved in vitro by HIV-1 PR as predicted. The presence of a charged residue (arginine) at the primary cleavage site distinguishes this from other known naturally occurring cleavage sites. Microinjection of HIV-1 PR into cultured human fibroblasts resulted in a 9-fold increase in the percentage of cells with an altered and abnormal distribution of vimentin intermediate filaments. Most commonly, the intermediate filaments collapsed into a clump with a juxtanuclear localization. These results support the possibility that intermediate filament proteins may serve as substrates within HIV-1-infected cells."
3870,0.01,2.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proved effective in prolonging survival and improving the quality of life of the people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). For the successful treatment of HIV infection, at least 95% adherence to HAART is required. This study sought to assess adherence to HAART and to identify factors enhancing adherence within the study population. The study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey of 428 patients attending the antiretroviral (ARV) clinic of the Federal Medical Centre, Makurdi. Self-reported adherence and other data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data were analysed using SPSS 11.0 and Epi6; and were exported into Systat 11 for multivariate logistic regression. There were 151 (35.3%) males and 277 (64.7%) females. The mean age was 36.7 +/- 9.6 years. Self-reported adherence rate was 268 (62.6%). The factor most predictive of adherence to HAART was availability of ARVs [OR = 5.2; 95% confidence interval 3.1-8.6; p < 0.001], followed by the ability to afford regular visits to the ARV clinic [OR = 1.7; 95% confidence interval 1.04-2.8; p = 0.034]. A recent diagnosis of HIV made less than 3 years prior to the study period was also significantly associated with adherence to HAART (chi2 = 8.94; p = 0.003). Availability of ARVs and ability to afford to regularly visit the clinic among other factors, positively influenced adherence to HAART among PLWHA. Efforts should be targeted at constant provision of free ARVs and early initiation of therapy for those requiring treatment, as well as ensuring regular adherence-education."
9755,0.01,2.0000,"Four hundred and fifty-nine Ethiopian volunteer blood donors were prospectively studied for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Delta agent infections. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was 11%, anti-HBs and only anti-HBc 66% and 2%, respectively. Thus, the total HBV infection rate was 79%. There was a single donor with antibody against Delta antigen. The rarity of HBeAg among HBsAg carriers, the lack of occurrence of factors favouring transmission and risk calculations using the available data indicate that post-transfusion hepatitis due to HBV is unlikely to be common in this highly endemic country with very limited financial resources allocated for health services. Thus, we question the validity of indiscriminate screening of all donated blood and we suggest that health policies should emphasize the need for preventive measures."

This prospective, longitudinal, randomized, two-arm controlled clinical trial aims to test the efficacy of FAmily CEntered advance care planning among adults living with AIDS and/or HIV with co-morbidities on congruence in treatment preferences, healthcare utilization, and quality of life. The FAmily CEntered intervention arm is two face-to-face sessions with a trained, certified facilitator: Session 1) Disease-Specific Advance Care Planning Respecting Choices Interview; Session 2) Completion of advance directive. The Healthy Living Control arm is: Session 1) Developmental/Relationship History; Session 2) Nutrition. Follow-up data will be collected at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-intervention. A total of 288 patient/surrogate dyads will be enrolled from five hospital-based, out-patient clinics in Washington, District of Columbia. Participants will be HIV positive and ≥ 21 years of age; surrogates will be ≥ 18 years of age. Exclusion criteria are homicidality, suicidality, psychosis, and impaired cognitive functioning. We hypothesize that this intervention will enhance patient-centered communication with a surrogate decision-maker about end of life treatment preferences over time, enhance patient quality of life and decrease health care utilization. We further hypothesize that this intervention will decrease health disparities for Blacks in completion of advance directives. If proposed aims are achieved, the benefits of palliative care, particularly increased treatment preferences about end-of-life care and enhanced quality of life, will be extended to people living with AIDS."
3133,0.01,2.0000,"We performed a community-based study of 12 villages of southern Taiwan's A-Lein Township to investigate the epidemiology of hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Of 6,095 patients, 13.8% were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg(+)) and 17.0% were positive for anti-HCV (anti-HCV(+)). Infection was found to be inversely related to educational level and to be directly related to the frequency of the receipt of parenteral injection for medical purposes. Risk factors for HBsAg positivity were male sex, age < or = 50 years, and a family history of hepatocellular carcinoma. Risk factors for HCV seropositivity were lower education level, frequent parenteral injections, blood transfusion, menial occupations, smoking, and age > 50 years. Therefore, risk factors for HBsAg(+) and anti-HCV(+) were different in these Taiwanese communities. Safe medical injections and improved health education for high-risk groups are imperative for preventing HCV transmission."
2991,0.01,2.0000,"HIV-related stigma remains a persistent global health concern among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWA) in developing nations. The literature is lacking in studies about healthcare students' perceptions of PLWA. This study is the first effort to understand stigmatizing attitudes toward HIV-positive patients by healthcare students in Mwanza, Tanzania, not just those who will be directly treating patients but also those who will be indirectly involved through nonclinical roles, such as handling patient specimens and private health information. A total of 208 students were drawn from Clinical Medicine, Laboratory Sciences, Health Records and Information Management, and Community Health classes at the Tandabui Institute of Health Sciences and Technology for a voluntary survey that assessed stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. Students generally obtained high scores on the overall survey instrument, pointing to low stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA and an overall willingness to treat PLWA with the same standard of care as other patients. However, there are gaps in knowledge that exist among students, such as a comprehensive understanding of all routes of HIV infection. The study also suggests that students who interact with patients as part of their training are less likely to exhibit stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. A comprehensive course in HIV infection, one that includes classroom sessions focused on the epidemiology and routes of transmission as well as clinical opportunities to directly interact with PLWA-perhaps through teaching sessions led by PLWA-may allow for significant reductions in stigma toward such patients and improve clinical outcomes for PLWA around the world."
8577,0.01,2.0000,"The objective of the present study was to determine mortality because of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) in a nationwide population of HIV-infected patients, 7 years following the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). All departments of internal medicine and infectious diseases from the GERMIVIC Study Group prospectively recorded all deaths in HIV-infected patients during 2003. Fifty-nine departments, following a total of 20 940 HIV-infected patients, participated in the study. Results were compared with those of previous surveys conducted using similar methodology in 1995, 1997 and 2001. Among 215 deaths observed during 2003, 101 (46.9%) were related to AIDS, 27 (12.6%) to ESLD and 87 (40.5%) to other causes. Mortality because of ESLD represented 23.7% of non-AIDS-related deaths. Patients dying from ESLD had chronic hepatitis because of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 92.6% of cases and moderate (30-60 g) or high (>60 g) alcohol consumption (43.5% and 26.0%, respectively). In this population, deaths because of ESLD were 1.5% in 1995, 6.6% in 1997, 14.3% in 2001 and 12.6% in 2003. The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma as a cause of death remained high in 2003 but stable when compared with 2001 (25%vs 14.8%). Treatment of hepatitis C in patients who died from ESLD was more frequent in 2003 (44.4%) than in 2001 (26.3%). Seven years after the introduction of HAART, ESLD associated with HCV infections is a leading cause of mortality in HIV-infected patients, which did not increase between the years 2001 and 2003."
4703,0.01,2.0000,"Injection drug use is a common route of infection for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the UK. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and force of infection for HBV among injecting drug users (IDUs) recruited from multiple community and drug agency settings in England and Wales between 1990 and 2004. Cross-sectional studies of IDUs in and out of contact with drug agencies were conducted throughout the 15-year period. Oral fluid samples were tested for antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between risk factors and anti-HBc positivity and force of infection models were explored. In total, 2527 injectors were recruited from community settings, and 29 386 from drug agencies. Anti-HBc prevalence was 31% (95% CI 30.7-31.8%). It declined in the early 1990s from around 50% in 1992 to 25% in 1999, after which it increased slightly. It was also higher in those who had injected for longer, older IDUs, those recruited in London and North West England, and those reporting having a previous voluntary confidential HIV test. The force of infection models suggested that the incidence of infection increased in 1999-2004 compared with 1993-1998, and was higher in new injectors compared with those injecting for > or =1 year. In conclusion, findings suggest ongoing HBV transmission in recent years despite an overall decline in prevalence in the early and mid-1990s, and highlight the importance of targeting vaccination programmes at new IDUs who have high incidence rates of infection."
1035,0.01,2.0000,"UC781, a thiocarboxanilide nonnucleoside inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT), inhibited RT DNA polymerase activity in vitro with marked potency. Significant inhibition was noted at a 1:1 molar ratio of UC871 to RT, characteristic of a tight-binding inhibitor. Infectivity of the HIV-1(IIIB) laboratory strain was eliminated in a concentration-dependent manner following short exposure of isolated virion particles to UC781. Neither nevirapine nor certain other carboxanilide nonnucleoside inhibitors were effective in this manner. Endogenous reverse transcription in UC781-treated virus particles was markedly reduced. Treatment of chronically HIV-1-infected H9 cells with UC781 did not alter virus production, but the infectivity of the virus produced by the cells during drug exposure was markedly reduced. Moreover, the infectivity of nascent virus produced by the UC781-treated H9 cells after removal of exogenous drug was dramatically attenuated. Similarly, pretreatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from HIV-infected patients abolished the infectivity of virus produced by these cells after removal of exogenous drug, as measured by coculture experiments with uninfected cord blood mononuclear cells, indicating the utility of UC781 against a variety of clinical HIV samples. Importantly, preincubation of uninfected MT2 cells with UC781 rendered these cells refractory to subsequent HIV infection in the absence of extracellular drug, an effect that persisted for several days following removal of exogenous drug. These unique properties of UC781 indicate that this nonnucleoside inhibitor may have considerable promise for use in retrovirucidal formulations to minimize the spread of HIV from infected to noninfected individuals."

Amplification of at least one gene was successful for 144 isolates. All three genes were obtained for 136 isolates. Subtyping showed that CRF01_AE was predominant (130 cases). According to the ANRS September 2004 list, polymorphism substitutions (>50% versus the subtype B consensus) of CRF01_AE at drug resistance positions were observed only in protease: I13V (81%), E35D (87%), M36I (100%), R41K (96%), and H69K (100%). Two strains bore one major resistance mutation to PIs: M46I and N88D. Five other strains carried drug resistance mutations to RTIs: K70R (one strain), V75M (three strains), and K101E (one strain).

7786,0.01,2.0000,"To provide additional information on the acquisition of host cell membrane proteins by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) produced by natural cellular reservoirs, two different field isolates were used to infect ex vivo expanded peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and human lymphoid tissue histocultures. The insertion of host-derived HLA-DR, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), CD40, CD40L, and CD86 within HIV-1 particles was evaluated by using specific antibodies linked to a solid matrix to capture ultrafiltrated viral progeny. Overall, our data indicate that neither the HIV-1 co-receptor usage (i.e., T-tropic or macrophage-tropic) nor the cellular source of HIV-1 has an impact on the incorporation process but it was found to be under the influence of the donor source. Given that most viral replication is thought to occur in lymphoid tissues and previous works have shown that HIV-1 life cycle is affected by several virus-anchored host proteins, our results suggest that this phenomenon is likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of this retroviral infection."

IL-10 is also known to interfere with HIV infection in vitro. To evaluate the induction of IL-10 by HIV antigens in HCW occupationally exposed to HIV, 18 HCW with percutaneous injury were enrolled in this study, 9 of them exposed to HIV-contaminated blood, and 9 exposed to HIV-negative blood. PBMC were incubated on plates coated with HIV-1 antigens, and IL-10 was measured in supernatants by ELISA. Five of nine HCW exposed to HIV-contaminated blood presented HIV-induced IL-10. Two of nine HCW exposed to HIV-negative source patients also had detectable levels of HIV-induced IL-10, one of them in the sample obtained on the day of accidental exposure. There was a relationship between the type of device involved in injury and IL-10 production. Individuals exposed to hollow needles or scalpels presented HIV-induced IL-10, whereas those exposed to solid needles and to digital puncture did not, suggesting a relationship between infectious load and IL-10. Although occupational exposure to HIV leads to a low rate of seroconversion, these individuals can develop an antigen-specific immune response characterized in our study by induction of IL-10 in PBMC in vitro."
6318,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection occurring in a boy who was 6 years 2 months old is reported. The patient is thought to have been infected with HBV by exchange blood transfusion (horizontal infection) in the neonatal period. Jaundice appeared eight months after birth. He was subsequently treated and follow-up with a diagnosis of hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen (Ag)-positive chronic persistent hepatitis. His mother and other family members were HBsAg-negative. Postmortem examination revealed a multinodular growth of hepatocellular carcinoma of trabecular and solid pattern, mainly of the right lobe, complicated with mild fibrosis of the liver. Numerous HBsAg-positive hepatocytes demonstrated by orcein staining and the indirect immunoperoxidase method were present in the noncancerous area. This hepatocellular carcinoma is considered to have occurred within six years two months after HBV infection and not to have been associated with liver cirrhosis. The present case may be valuable for assessing the oncogenic properties of HBV and the incubation period of HBV infection before it develops into hepatocellular carcinoma."

Current treatment options are either of two IFN-based therapies or either of five oral nucleos(t)ide analogs which are used as monotherapy or in combination. Control of viral replication can be achieved basically in all patients today. However, despite the clinical efficacy of antivirals, long-term management remains a clinical challenge mainly due to the slow kinetics of HBsAg clearance. Emergence of viral resistance has been a challenge in the past with some but not all oral therapies. The development of novel therapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action might provide new opportunities to clear HBsAg and achieve HBsAg seroconversion which could be maintained off therapy. The long-term efficacy of combinations of IFN and/or nucleos(t)ide analogs might achieve antiviral synergy, preventing drug resistance and clearing viral covalently close circular DNA and infected cells."

2117,0.01,2.0000,"We investigated the influence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes on the clinical course of HCV infection in a haemodialysis population. In June 1991, a 4 year prospective follow-up programme was implemented in 184 consecutive haemodialysis patients. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma glutamine transferase (GGT) were performed every 2 months. When HCV antibody (Ab) (by second-generation ELISA) was positive, it was confirmed by RIBA 2 and HCV RNA amplification by PCR. The pattern of nucleotide sequence variability in the 5' non-coding region was categorized according to Simmonds' genotype classification. Risk factors including blood transfusions were evaluated. The levels of hepatic enzymes in HCV Ab-positive patients were retrospectively studied over a mean period of 11.8 years. ALT and GGT levels were assigned a score for every year of infection (0 = normal, 1 = fluctuating 2 = high levels). Fifty-two patients were HCV Ab reactive (30.4%), eight were RIBA undetermined and 44 were RIBA positive; 40 of these were HCV RNA positive (91%). Twelve patients were HCV RNA negative, suggesting that they had recovered from the infection. Four genotypes were identified: 1b [26 patients (65%)], 1a (one patient), 2 [12 patients (30%)] and 3 (one patient). The genotype distribution was not different from that found in patients with chronic hepatitis C and normal renal function of the same geographical area. Genotype 1b accounted for 75% of the cases before 1985 and an equal prevalence of the two major genotypes was observed after 1985. Patients infected with HCV subtype 1 had normal mean ALT levels, but higher levels in the follow-up period (28 +/- 15.6 IU/l) and higher ALT and GGT personal scores in the retrospective study. Genotype 1 patients had higher mean ALT levels after 6 months. HCV RNA-negative patients had lower ALT levels after 24 months. RIBA pattern could differentiate the patients. Patients with genotype 1 received a higher number of transfusions, while only 50% of HCV RNA-negative patients had been transfused. Our data suggest a worse course of HCV infection in haemodialysis patients infected with HCV subtype 1, but the severity of HCV infection can only be assessed by histology. Transaminases are only loosely correlated with severity."
4972,0.01,2.0000,"The surveillance of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) through case reporting only reflects the epidemiologic features of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) transmission a few years earlier and not the prevalence of HIV seropositivity. HIV infection is not a notifiable condition in Quebec. We were asked by the ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux du Québec to perform a pilot project for the surveillance of HIV seropositivity using a network of sentinel physicians. From May 15, 1988, to Sept. 30, 1989, physicians from four collaborating centres collected data on the serologic status, demographic characteristics and risk factors for 4209 patients who underwent HIV antibody testing. Of the 3899 subjects included in the study 7.9% were HIV positive. Through logistic regression analysis the following variables were found to be significantly associated with HIV seropositivity: presence of HIV-related symptoms (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 36.5), origin from an endemic area (POR 9.1), homosexuality or bisexuality (POR 8.4), intravenous drug use (POR 4.2), male sex (POR 2.8), previous HIV antibody testing (POR 2.5) and previous sexually transmitted disease (POR 1.8). Over the study period we found a large increase in HIV seroprevalence among intravenous drug users (4.2% in 1988 to 19.0% in 1989) (p = 0.02). This increase might reflect a recent change in the epidemiologic pattern of HIV transmission in Quebec. Surveillance of HIV seropositivity through a network of sentinel physicians may be a reasonable alternative to mandatory reporting."

Oocysts were detected in stool samples of 10 (16.9%) of the 59 patients studied, while Cryptosporidium spp. were present in 10.1% (6/59) and C. belli in 6.7% (4/59). The frequency of these parasites was higher among patients with diarrheic syndrome and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts < 200 cells/mm 3 , demonstrating the opportunistic characteristic of these infections. A significant association was observed between the lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy and the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and/or C. belli. Parasitism with Cryptosporidium spp. was more frequent in February and April, the months following the period of high rainfall. The same was not observed for C. belli. Genetic characterization of two isolates led to the identification of Cryptosporidium parvum, one of the main species associated with the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis."
4233,0.01,2.0000,"In order to assess the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance mutation profiles and evaluate the distribution of the genetic subtypes in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, blood samples from 547 HIV-1 infected patients failing antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, were collected during the years 2002 and 2003 to perform the viral resistance genotyping at the Renageno Laboratory from Rio de Janeiro (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation). Viral resistance genotyping was performed using ViroSeq Genotyping System (Celera Diagnostic-Abbott, US). The HIV-1 subtyping based on polymerase (pol) gene sequences (protease and reverse transcriptase-RT regions) was as follows: subtype B (91.2%), subtype F (4.9%), and B/F viral recombinant forms (3.3%). The subtype C was identified in two patients (0.4%) and the recombinant CRF_02/AG virus was found infecting one patient (0.2%). The HIV-1 genotyping profile associated to the reverse transcriptase inhibitors has shown a high frequency of the M184V mutation followed by the timidine-associated mutations. The K103N mutation was the most prevalent to the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor and the resistance associated to protease inhibitor showed the minor mutations L63P, L10F/R, and A71V as the more prevalent. A large proportion of subtype B was observed in HIV-1 treated patients from Rio de Janeiro. In addition, we have identified the circulation of drug-resistant HIV-1 subtype C and are presenting the first report of the occurrence of an African recombinant CRF_02/AG virus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A clear association between HIV-1 subtypes and protease resistance mutations was observed in this study. The maintenance of resistance genotyping programs for HIV-1 failing patients is important to the management of ARV therapies and to attempt and monitor the HIV-1 subtype prevalence in Brazil."
1208,0.01,2.0000,"The high levels of genetic diversity shown by hepatitis B virus (HBV) are commonly attributed to the low fidelity of its polymerase. However, the rate of spontaneous mutation of human HBV in vivo is currently unknown. Here, based on the evolutionary principle that the population frequency of lethal mutations equals the rate at which they are produced, we have estimated the mutation rate of HBV in vivo by scoring premature stop codons in 621 publicly available, full-length, molecular clone sequences derived from patients. This yielded an estimate of 8.7 × 10-5 spontaneous mutations per nucleotide per cell infection in untreated patients, which should be taken as an upper limit estimate because PCR errors and/or lack of effective lethality may inflate observed mutation frequencies. We found that, in patients undergoing lamivudine/adefovir treatment, the HBV mutation rate was elevated by more than sixfold, revealing a mutagenic effect of this treatment. Genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms indicated that lamivudine/adefovir treatment increases the fraction of A/T-to-G/C base substitutions, consistent with recent work showing similar effects of lamivudine in cellular DNA. Based on these data, the rate at which HBV produces new genetic variants in treated patients is similar to or even higher than in RNA viruses. "
2586,0.01,2.0000,"The level of genetic variation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a member of the lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family, is high relative to that of retroviruses in some other genera. The high error rates of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in cell-free systems suggest an explanation for this high genetic variation. To test whether the in vivo rate of mutation during reverse transcription of HIV-1 is as high as predicted by cell-free studies, and therefore higher than that rates of mutation of retroviruses in other genera, we developed an in vivo assay for detecting forward mutations in HIV-1, using the lacZ alpha peptide gene as a reporter for mutations. This system allows the rates and types of mutations that occur during a single cycle of replication to be studied. We found that the forward mutation rate for HIV-1 was 3.4 x 10(-5) mutations per bp per cycle. Base substitution mutations predominated; G-to-A transition mutations were the most common base substitution. The in vivo mutation rates for HIV-1 are three and seven times higher than those previously reported for two other retroviruses, spleen necrosis virus and bovine leukemia virus, respectively. In contrast, our calculated in vivo mutation rate for HIV-1 is about 20-fold lower than the error rate of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, with the same target sequence. This finding indicates that HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo is not as error prone as predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase in cell-free studies. Our data suggest that the fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may not accurately reflect the level of genetic variation in a natural infection."
644,0.01,2.0000,"The nonstructural 5B (NS5B) protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity plays a pivotal role in viral replication. Therefore, monitoring of its naturally occurring mutations is very important for the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines. In the present study, mutations in the partial NS5B gene (492 bp) from 166 quasispecies of 15 genotype-1b (GT) treatment-naïve Korean chronic patients were determined and mutation patterns and frequencies mainly focusing on the T cell epitope regions were evaluated. The mutation frequency within the CD8+ T cell epitopes was significantly higher than those outside the CD8+ T cell epitopes. Of note, the mutation frequency within predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, a particular mutational hotspot in Korean patients was significantly higher than it was in patients from other areas, suggesting distinctive CD4+ T cell-mediated immune pressure against HCV infection in the Korean population. The mutation frequency in the NS5B region was positively correlated with patients with carrier-stage rather than progressive liver disease (chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Furthermore, the mutation frequency in four codons (Q309, A333, V338 and Q355) known to be related to the sustained virological response (SVR) and end-of treatment response (ETR) was also significantly higher in Korean patients than in patients from other areas. In conclusion, a high degree of mutation frequency in the HCV GT-1b NS5B region, particularly in the predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, was found in Korean patients, suggesting the presence of distinctive CD4+ T cell pressure in the Korean population. This provides a likely explanation of why relatively high levels of SVR after a combined therapy of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) in Korean chronic patients with GT-1b infections are observed.

1521,0.01,2.0000,"If human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccines are to be highly effective, it is essential to understand the virologic factors that contribute to HIV-1 transmission. It is likely that transmission is determined, in part, by the genotype or phenotype (or both) of infectious virus present in the index case, which in turn will influence the quantity of virus that may be exchanged during sexual contact. Transmission may also depend on the fitness of the virus for replication in the exposed individual, which may be influenced by whether a virus encounters a target cell that is susceptible to infection by that specific variant. Of interest, our data suggest that the complexity of the virus that is transmitted may be different in female and male sexual exposures."
6983,0.01,2.0000,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are prevalent worldwide, and share similar means of transmission. These infections may influence each other in evolution and outcome, including cancer or immunodeficiency. Many studies have reported the influence of genetic markers on the host immune response against different persistent viral infections, such as HTLV-1 infection, pointing to the importance of the individual genetic background on their outcomes. However, despite recent advances on the knowledge of the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection, gaps in the understanding of the role of the individual genetic background on the progress to disease clinically manifested still remain. In this scenario, much less is known regarding the influence of genetic factors in the context of dual or triple infections or their influence on the underlying mechanisms that lead to outcomes that differ from those observed in monoinfection. This review describes the main factors involved in the virus-host balance, especially for some particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes, and other important genetic markers in the development of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and other persistent viruses, such as HIV and HCV.

1278,0.01,2.0000,"HLA and other genetic variants, playing an important role in innate and adaptive immunity, are known to influence tuberculosis (TB) development in HIV-1-positive (HIV+) patients. Because inflammasome genes contribute to HIV-1 susceptibility, we investigated the possible association between polymorphisms in inflammasome genes with HIV-1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis coinfection (HIV+TB+) in a case/control cohort of Brazilian individuals. Nineteen single-nucleotide polymoprhims in 8 inflammasome genes (NLRP1, NLRP3, AIM2, CARD8, CASP1, IL1B, IL1R, and HSP90) were analyzed in HIV+TB+ Brazilian patients (from Recife, Pernambuco). CARD8 rs6509365 polymorphism was associated with HIV+TB+ (P = 5 × 10(-5)), suggesting a predisposing role of this variant in M. tuberculosis susceptibility in HIV+ subjects (odds ratio = 2.45). This effect is even strong when this allele is combined to CARD8 rs2043211 single-nucleotide polymoprhim. The results of this study support the novel association between CARD8 gene and HIV+TB+ coinfection, demonstrating that inflammasome genetics could influence HIV-1 infection and the development of opportunistic infection."

The aim of current study was to investigate the association of clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with promoter polymorphisms within the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and its major ligand, regulated upon activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) genes. Five chemokine system polymorphisms (CCR5 Delta32, CCR5 promoter 59029G/A, 59353C/T, RANTES -403G/A, and -28C/G) were studied in a total of 698 subjects. The carriage of each genetic variant was compared among ""spontaneously recovered"" group (n = 243), ""chronic carrier"" group (n = 349), and ""unexposed"" group (n = 106). CCR5 59029G promoter variant was associated with clearance of HBV infection in an acute phase (OR = 1.71, P = 0.006, dominant model; OR = 2.17, P < 0.001, recessive model) and amelioration of hepatic inflammation (P = 0.003) with the control of HBV replication (P = 0.04) in chronic carriers. Interestingly, CCR5 59029 was linked completely to CCR5 59353, and CCR5 Delta32 homozygosity or heterozygosity was not found in any Korean patient. No association was seen with RANTES polymorphisms at position -403 and -28. The CCR5 59029G/CCR5 59353T polymorphism may play a role in the clearance of HBV infection."

The simplicity of this novel plaque assay allowed us to examine a large number of serum samples from patients with HIV infection for neutralizing antibody activity against two human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) strains. During the progression of clinical disease, the neutralizing activity in the sera from two individual patients remained unchanged or increased. A patient with a known time of HIV infection produced cross-neutralizing antibody at 25-34 weeks. The neutralizing activity in the sera from 17 asymptomatic carriers, four patients with AIDS-related complex and four AIDS patients was also examined and was found to be unrelated to the clinical stage."

HCV and HIV viral load, lymphocyte CD4 counts, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) were measured before and 3 months after starting treatment in 2 groups: Group 1 (n = 15) treated with 2 nucleoside analogues and Group 2 (n = 15) treated with 2 nucleoside analogues and a protease inhibitor. Results show a significant increase in lymphocyte and a significant decrease in HIV viral load in the both group but no significant change in HCV viral load and in ALT and AST. In conclusion efficiency of anti-HIV therapy (combination of 2 nucleoside analogues with or without a protease inhibitor) doesn't seem to have any impact on the course of HCV viremia in HIV-coinfected patients."
309,0.01,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in subjects coinfected with HIV. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) are licensed for the treatment of HIV-1 and HBV infection, respectively, but both have in vivo and in vitro activity against HBV. This study evaluated the anti-HBV activity of TDF compared to ADV in HIV/HBV-coinfected subjects. ACTG A5127 was a prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of daily 10 mg of ADV versus 300 mg of TDF in subjects with HBV and HIV coinfection on stable ART, with serum HBV DNA >/= 100,000 copies/mL, and plasma HIV-1 RNA </= 10,000 copies/mL. This study closed early based on results of a prespecified interim review, as the primary noninferiority end point had been met without safety issues. Fifty-two subjects were randomized. At baseline, 73% of subjects had a plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, 86% were HBeAg positive, 94% were 3TC resistant, median serum ALT was 52 IU/L, and 98% had compensated liver disease. The mean time-weighted average change in serum HBV DNA from baseline to week 48 (DAVG(48)) was -4.44 log(10) copies/mL for TDF and -3.21 log(10) copies/mL for ADV. There was no difference in toxicity between the 2 treatment arms, with 11 subjects (5 ADV and 6 TDF) experiencing elevations of serum ALT on treatment. In conclusion, over 48 weeks, treatment with either ADV or TDF resulted in clinically important suppression of serum HBV DNA. Both drugs are safe and efficacious for patients coinfected with HBV and HIV."

Eighteen of those 35 samples came from patients who did not have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and had confirmed alternative diagnoses. Seven patients had asymptomatic carriage of P. jiroveci over periods of < or = 9.5 months after an episode of PCP, and in all 7 cases, a change in genotype from that in the original episode of PCP was observed. The absence of P. jiroveci DNA in one-fourth of the 47 samples and the observed changes in genotype during asymptomatic carriage do not support the latency model of infection. Asymptomatic carriage in HIV-infected patients may play a role in transmission of P. jiroveci and may even supply a reservoir for future infections."

A matched, case-control study was performed to examine the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and azole use on the incidence of invasive cryptococcal disease in HIV-infected patients. The study was performed at a metropolitan hospital with a large indigent population and an incidence of seven cases of cryptococcal disease per 1000 persons with AIDS. Bivariate analysis, matched on CD4 count, revealed that both HAART use [odds ratio (OR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.99] and azole use (OR 0.14; 95% CI 0.06-0.34) had a protective effect. Conditional logistic regression stratified on CD4 lymphocyte count revealed a protective role for azole use (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.06-0.40) but not for HAART use (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.18-1.26). Of note, the prevalence of HAART use was low in both cases and controls, with only 12% of cases and 23% of controls on HAART. The results of this study support previous evidence that azole use prevents invasive cryptococcal disease. Although current guidelines for the prophylaxis of opportunistic infections do not suggest routine prophylaxis for cryptococcal infection, this issue should be reconsidered, especially in populations that have a low prevalence of HAART use."

However, whether combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) reverses or exacerbates hepatic fibrosis remains unclear.This was an observational retrospective study. cART-naïve HIV-infected subjects without a history of substance abuse (including alcohol) had liver disease stage determined by aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio indices (APRIs) and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) before and 24 and 48 weeks after cART. All the data were retrieved from previously established cohorts. Values before and after cART were compared using Wilcoxon test for paired samples. Regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with moderate-to-severe liver disease.Of the 1105 HIV-infected subjects, 120 were HBV coinfected and 64 were HCV coinfected. About 20% of HIV monoinfected participants had APRI and FIB-4 scores consistent with moderate-to-significant fibrosis compared to ∼36% of HIV-HBV coinfected and 67% to 77% of HIV-HCV coinfected participants. In adjusted analyses compared with HIV monoinfection, HBV coinfection was associated with 1.18-fold higher APRI (P < 0.001) and a 1.12-fold higher FIB-4 (P = 0.007) prior to cART; while HCV coinfection was associated with 1.94-fold higher APRI (P < 0.001) and a 1.43-fold higher FIB-4 (P < 0.001). After 48 weeks of cART, both fibrosis scores decreased in all subjects; however, HCV coinfection was still associated with higher fibrosis scores at week 48 compared to HIV monoinfection.cART was associated with improvement in hepatic fibrosis scores in the majority of HIV-hepatitis coinfected and HIV-monoinfected Chinese participants."

7846,0.01,2.0000,"The rapidity of HIV-RNA suppression after initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) may impact immune reconstitution in developing countries, where patients initiate cART at low CD4 T cell counts. One hundred and thirty-five HIV-1 Mozambican adults initiating cART were prospectively followed over 16 months within a larger observational study. Plasma HIV-RNA, CD4 counts, and CD8 T cell activation were monitored at the pre-cART visit and at 4, 10, and 16 months during cART. Of the 89 patients with available HIV-RNA data at pre-cART and 4 and 10 months post-cART, 68% (60/89) suppressed HIV-RNA at 4 months and were defined as ""early virological controllers""(EC). Twenty of the 29 remaining patients who did not control HIV-RNA at 4 months did so at 10 months and were classified as ""late virological controllers""(LC). Nine (10%) patients did not control HIV-RNA at either time point. Both initiating an EFV-containing cART regimen and having pre-cART tuberculosis were significantly associated with early HIV-RNA suppression if locked into a multivariate model [EFV OR: 13.6 (95% CI 1.7; 108.1) p = 0.014) tuberculosis OR: 11.0 (95% CI 1.4; 87.9) p = 0.024]. EC demonstrated significantly lower median activated CD8 T cells at 4, 10, and 16 months post-cART than did LC. Approximately 63% (12/19) of LC experienced reappearance of detectable HIV-RNA at 6 months postcontrol as compared to 15% (2/60) of EC (p = 0.001).

Susceptible residents were vaccinated against HBV and their serological response to hepatitis B vaccination determined. From December 2002 to April 2003, five residents with acute hepatitis B infection were identified with an attack rate of 5.5% and a case fatality rate of 40%. Three other residents were identified as HBV surface antigen and e-antigen positive carrier. None of the nursing staff tested positive for acute HBV infection or HBV carriage. Diabetic patients who were exposed to a shared finger-stick device for blood sampling were 10.7 times more likely to contract an acute HBV infection (RR 10.7; 95% CI 1.3-91.3). Other potential risk factors were undergoing podiatric care and being exposed to the shared razor blade of the hairdresser. The transmission of the infection could be controlled by restricting the use of finger-stick capillary sampling devices to individual patients, assigning separate glucometers to individual patients and, implementation of standard infection-control recommendations like wearing gloves and performing hand hygiene by the nursing staff, assigning separate podiatric sets to individual patients. HBV vaccination of the residents with three doses of HBV vaccine has not induced a sufficient degree of protection.

Twenty-seven of the patients were hepatitis delta virus (HDV) superinfected. Intrahepatic HBV-DNA was detected in 54 (72%) patients, 32 (59%) of them with replicative forms. The presence of replicative forms was directly related to liver HBcAg and inversely related to liver HDAg, as shown by multivariate analysis. However, 14 patients with intrahepatic HBV-DNA non-replicative pattern and about half of HDV-infected patients were liver HBcAg and/or serum HBV-DNA positive, mostly in low amounts. Histological inflammatory activity was strongly related to liver HBcAg expression regardless of HDV superinfection, as confirmed by multivariate analysis. Our results confirm previous studies about the concordance between intrahepatic HBV-DNA replicative pattern and liver HBcAg expression and about inhibition by HDV of high-level HBV replication.

Allografts from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-carriers without a significant liver disease have been proposed for liver transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Combination prophylaxis schemes against HBV post-liver transplantation (LT) recurrence are currently available; the efficacy of those schemes in HBV-related cirrhosis and HCC must be assessed. This report describes the allocation of HBsAg-positive grafts in three HBsAg-positive recipients, with HBV-related cirrhosis and evolving HCC lesions, two of them with hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) coinfection. Patients were administered anti-hepatitis B immunoglobulins (HBIGs) and lamivudine in order to prevent HBV recurrence. In spite of anti-HBV prophylaxis, HBV infection did persist after LT in all patients (no serum clearance of HBsAg). HBV replication assessed by serum HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) presence was detected in the first month after LT in the 3 recipients. A prompt HDV reinfection with a clinical and histological pattern of hepatitis was observed in the 2 HBV / HDV coinfected recipients. In 1 of them, an evolving chronic hepatitis required a second LT. The non-HDV-infected patient showed an uneventful follow-up, but the lack of the neutralizing effect of HBIGs and the high risk of escape mutants forced the addition of adefovir-dipivoxil to lamivudine, in order to prevent viral variants and hepatitis recurrence. In conclusion, allografts from HBsAg-positive donors in HBsAg-positive recipients are associated with the persistence of the HBsAg after LT due to the failure of HBIG prophylaxis, even if lamivudine does inhibit virion production. This condition favors HDV replication and HDV hepatitis recurrence in coinfected patients. The allocation of HBsAg-positive grafts in HBsAg-positive recipients could be justified only in recipients without HDV coinfection and a combined prophylaxis with lamivudine and adefovir-dipivoxil is currently the best way to manage escape mutants in these recipients."
1452,0.01,2.0000,"In a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individual, immune-pressure-mediated positive selection operates to maintain the antigenic polymorphism on the gp120 third variable (V3) loop. Recently, we suggested on the basis of sequencing C2/V3 segments from an HIV-1 subtype E-infected family that a V3 sequence lineage group of the non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) variants (group 1) was relatively resistant to positive selection pressure (35). To better understand the relationship between the intensity of positive selection pressure and cell tropism of the virus, we determined the linkage between each V3 genotype and its function of directing coreceptor preference and MT2 cell tropism. The biological characterization of a panel of V3 recombinant viruses showed that all of the group 1 V3 sequences could confer an NSI/CCR5-using (NSI/R5) phenotype on HIV-1(LAI), whereas the group 2 V3 sequence, which was more positively charged than the group 1 sequence, dictated mainly a syncytium-inducing, CXCR4-using (SI/X4) phenotype. Phylogenetic analysis of C2/V3 sequences encoding group 1 or 2 V3 suggested that the variants carrying group 1 V3 are the ancestors of the intrafamilial infection and persisted in the family, while the variants carrying group 2 V3 evolved convergently from the group 1 V3 variants during disease progression in the individuals. Finally, a statistical test showed that the V3 sequence that could dictate an NSI/R5 phenotype had a synonymous substitution rate significantly higher than the nonsynonymous substitution rate. These data suggest that V3 sequences of the subtype E NSI/R5 variants are more resistant to positive selection pressure than those of the SI/X4 variants."
5177,0.01,2.0000,"CD8(+) T lymphocytes control human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection by a cytotoxic major histocompatibility complex-restricted pathway as well as by secretion of noncytotoxic soluble inhibitory factors. Several components of CD8(+) cell supernatants have been identified that contribute to the latter activity. In this study we report that prothymosin alpha (ProTalpha), a protein found in the cell culture medium of the herpesvirus saimiri-transformed CD8(+) T-cell line, K#1 50K, has potent HIV-1-inhibitory activity. Depletion of native ProTalpha from an HIV-1-inhibitory fraction of CD8(+) cell supernatants removes the inhibitory activity, supporting its role in inhibition via soluble mediators. ProTalpha is an abundant, acidic peptide that has been reported to be localized in the nucleus and associated with cell proliferation and activation of transcription. In this report we demonstrate that ProTalpha suppresses HIV-1 replication, its activity is target cell specific, and inhibition occurs following viral integration. Native and recombinant ProTalpha protein potently inhibit HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven gene expression in macrophages. Furthermore studies using different promoters in lentiviral vectors (cytomegalovirus and phosphoglycerate kinase) revealed that suppression of viral replication by ProTalpha is not HIV LTR specific."
1470,0.01,2.0000,"The Tat protein has several functional domains, one of which is the cysteine-rich domain that is a highly conserved region in spite of the presence of many subtypes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Although the cysteine-rich domain is a potential site for Zn(2+) binding, it is controversial whether Zn(2+) is substantially essential for the structure and activities of the Tat protein. To study the significance of Zn(2+) in the cysteine-rich domain of the Tat protein particularly released to the extracellular space, we raised the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 5A4, which has an attractive property of recognizing the Zn(2+)-binding Tat(20-41) peptide but not the apo-Tat(20-41) peptide. MAb 5A4 inhibited the trans-activation of the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) in HeLa-CD4-LTR/beta-gal cells induced by treatment with the recombinant Tat protein, indicating that MAb 5A4 can recognize the full-length Tat protein and inhibit its trans-activity. The antibody also inhibited the apoptosis of Jurkat cells induced by treatment with the released native-Tat-protein-containing supernatant from the culture of HIV-1(JRFL)-infected cells. These results suggest that Zn(2+), whose structure is closely associated with not only the trans-activation of HIV-LTR but also the induction of apoptosis, binds to the extracellular native Tat protein. The Zn(2+)-binding cysteine-rich domain therefore can be a molecular target in the development of an anti-Tat vaccine and agents for the control of extracellular-Tat-protein-mediated pathogenesis leading to the progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."
4731,0.01,2.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy has greatly reduced AIDS-related morbidity and mortality; however, its widespread use has been associated with a marked rise in the frequency of cardiovascular diseases in patients with HIV. Moreover, HIV infection is associated with accelerated coronary atherosclerosis and vasculopathy, although the mechanisms underlying these findings have not been determined. We describe the case of a 45-year-old woman with HIV/HCV coinfection, irritable bowel syndrome, and accelerated progression of coronary atherosclerosis after execution of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this case, the rapidity of progression of atherosclerosis seems linked principally to chronic inflammation and excess immune activation that can depend by a concourse of factors (chronic C hepatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, PCI execution) not directly associated with traditional risk factors. Caregivers following HIV-infected patients should be aware of the increased risk of accelerated atherogenesis in these subjects, principally in case of presence of causes of intense immune activation."
9188,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates from Iranian patients around the country were characterized. Eighty-one complete genomes from HBV isolates were sequenced and analyzed. The studied population was grouped into three categories including inactive carriers, patients with chronic hepatitis, and patients with liver cirrhosis. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses revealed that Iranian patients were infected with HBV genotype D and subgenotype D1. The most common subtype was ayw2, followed by ayw3 and ayw4. Several deletions and insertions that had no correlation with disease outcome were observed in the HBV genomes. The most frequent mutation in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was sP120S. Almost half of the patients studied carried precore (PC) mutant variants and one-third of the studied population was infected with variants carrying basal core promoter (BCP) mutations. PC and BCP mutations were observed in older patients, especially in those with chronic liver disease. Sixty-seven patients (82.7%) were HBeAg negative, and the prevalence of precore mutant isolates (G1896A) was higher in this group than in HBeAg-positive patients. Lamivudine drug resistance mutations were detected after 1 year of treatment in about 30% of lamivudine-treated patients. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that HBV subgenotype D1 is the only subgenotype circulating in Iran, and there is no evidence of any exotic genotype in the region. The HBV PC (G1896A) mutation may play an important role in the clinical outcome of the disease by increasing the risk of progressive liver disease among Iranian patients infected with HBV."
7090,0.01,2.0000,"Raltegravir, as the first HIV integrase inhibitor, has been used and prospectively monitored since 2010 in our HIV outpatient centre, where over 1,200 patients are monitored. The aim of our report is to perform an interim assessment of the background, the safety profile and the clinical-laboratory monitoring of all patients treated with a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including raltegravir, for at least 12 months. In all, 109 pretreated patients started a raltegravir-containing cART when aged 44.8 plus or minus 19.2 years, with a history of HIV infection lasting 13.4 plus or minus 9.7 years. All subjects were monitored for at least 12 months (mean 17.2 plus or minus 10.3 months). In the vast majority of cases (93 of 109: 85.3%), multiple (3-16) prior cART changes prompted raltegravir introduction in advanced-salvage lines: 72 of 109 (66.1%) patients had even developed a concurrent triple-class resistance to anti-HIV compounds. The most frequent companion antiretroviral agents were: darunavir/ritonavir (75 cases), maraviroc (47 subjects), and etravirine (38 cases). The most common underlying conditions were: AIDS (46 patients), liver cirrhosis (31 cases), AIDS-related or other malignancies (23 cases), and major cardio-cerebro-vascular events (18 cases). A chronic HCV and HBV hepatitis were of concern in 48 and 23 patients, respectively. The adjunct of raltegravir favourably affected all clinical-laboratory markers of HIV disease progression, and those of the broad spectrum of comorbidities, except for two patients who failed the raltegravir-containing cART due to insufficient adherence. Despite the already compromised clinical situation, a minority of subjects experienced mild-transient clinical-laboratory untoward events possibly attributable to raltegravir, such that no patients discontinued raltegravir during the observation period. Only three AIDS-defining conditions became apparent during raltegravir-based cART; chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy cycles were performed as scheduled in patients suffering from cancer; chronic hepatitis B and C progressed to liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocarcinoma in only 2 and 6 patients. Otherwise, treatment with pegylated interferon-ribavirin became feasible in 25 patients of 48 with chronic HCV. During raltegravir-containing cART, neither autoimmune disorders nor novel malignancies were diagnosed. Only mild-transient gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue, dizziness, insomnia and cutaneous rash were reported, although their relationship with the study drug was difficult to assess due to multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. Abnormal liver function testings were observed in 57 patients (52.3%), all suffering from concurrent hepato-biliary disorders. Significant increases in serum lipids and/or lipase levels versus baseline values were never registered: serum lipid levels significantly improved after raltegravir introduction. Our experience with raltegravir underlines its excellent efficacy and safety profile, which exploits a novel mechanism of action, and displays no cross-resistance with any other antiretroviral. A progressively extended prescription in naive patients and early cART lines will allow the therapeutic potential of raltegravir to be exploited. "
7856,0.01,2.0000,"Cholangitis in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is usually associated with opportunistic infections by cryptosporidium species or cytomegalovirus, but in about a third of cases no opportunistic agent is identified. We suspected some of these cases of biliary disease might be explained by infection with the microsporidia species Enterocytozoon bieneusi, an obligate intracellular protozoan that causes chronic diarrhea in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)."
348,0.01,2.0000,"We describe the identification of the protozoan parasite Enterocytozoon bieneusi in the stool of a patient who was not infected with HIV but who presented with persistent diarrheal disease and severe abdominal complaints. The patient was not infected with HIV but had been noted to have a decreased CD4 cell count since at least 1992 and had had a prior episode of cryptococcal meningitis. The organisms were detected in stool smears with a modified trichrome stain and were identified to the species level by transmission electron microscopy of the stool. The patient responded readily and dramatically to treatment with albendazole, with resolution of symptoms and clearance of the organisms from the stool. Eight or possibly nine other cases of E. bieneusi infection associated with diarrheal disease in individuals who were not infected with HIV were identified in the English-language literature. In two individuals with intact immune function, symptoms were self-limited and diarrheal disease resolved within 2 weeks. The cases summarized herein suggest that E. bieneusi may be more commonly associated with sporadic diarrheal disease than was previously suspected and that the immune system may play a role in the control of this organism within the intestine."
3901,0.01,2.0000,"Infants born to HIV-1-infected mothers in resource-limited areas where replacement feeding is unsafe and impractical are repeatedly exposed to HIV-1 throughout breastfeeding. Despite this, the majority of infants do not contract HIV-1 postnatally, even in the absence of maternal antiretroviral therapy. This suggests that immune factors in breast milk of HIV-1-infected mothers help to limit vertical transmission. We compared the HIV-1 envelope-specific breast milk and plasma antibody responses of clade C HIV-1-infected postnatally transmitting and nontransmitting mothers in the control arm of the Malawi-based Breastfeeding Antiretrovirals and Nutrition Study using multivariable logistic regression modeling. We found no association between milk or plasma neutralization activity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or HIV-1 envelope-specific IgG responses and postnatal transmission risk. While the envelope-specific breast milk and plasma IgA responses also did not reach significance in predicting postnatal transmission risk in the primary model after correction for multiple comparisons, subsequent exploratory analysis using two distinct assay methodologies demonstrated that the magnitudes of breast milk total and secretory IgA responses against a consensus HIV-1 envelope gp140 (B.con env03) were associated with reduced postnatal transmission risk. These results suggest a protective role for mucosal HIV-1 envelope-specific IgA responses in the context of postnatal virus transmission. This finding supports further investigations into the mechanisms by which mucosal IgA reduces risk of HIV-1 transmission via breast milk and into immune interventions aimed at enhancing this response."
8675,0.01,2.0000,"In response to the confirmed transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from a surgeon to several patients in the Netherlands, a 'Committee for Prevention of Iatrogenic Hepatitis B' was established in 2000. During the years 2000-2008, the committee reviewed 99 cases of HBV-infected health care workers. Fifty of them were found to perform exposure prone procedures (EPPs). Because of high levels of HBV DNA (>100,000 copies/ml), a ban on performing EPPs was applied in 11/50 cases; 25/50 low-viremic health care workers were allowed to continue EPPs while their HBV load was being monitored; and 14/50 cases had stopped working or changed profession. In five restricted workers who started oral antiviral treatment, HBV replication was persistently suppressed, enabling the ban on EPPs to be lifted. Throughout the European Union different levels of HBV viremia have been chosen, above which health care workers are not allowed to perform EPPs. It remains unknown how this affects the safety of patients. Application in the Netherlands of a European or a British guideline would have, respectively, doubled or tripled the number of restricted health care workers."
6558,0.01,2.0000,"The identification of various risk factors of vertical human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission resulted in the development of strategies whose aim was to decrease the mother's viral load, to reduce her child's exposure to it during delivery, and to avoid the subsequent viral exposure due to breastfeeding. The administration of antiretroviral treatment during pregnancy, delivery and to the neonate (PACTG 076) proved to be useful. At a first stage, zidovudine was used. A triple combination therapy was then administered. Initially, the viral transmission in mothers who were enrolled in protocols for vertically transmitted HIV prophylaxis was reduced to 9.5%, whereas the last measurement carried out between 1998 and 2005, the initial figure was brought down to 2%. Nevertheless, the delivery of infected children whose mother's HIV status was unknown is still considered likely to happen. The main step to be taken to reduce HIV infection among children is to perform universal HIV tests during pregnancy, so that HIV positive pregnant patients conveniently receive proper prophylaxis. We look forward to achieving this by following the new prevention guidelines of vertically-transmitted HIV infection, developed by the Comisión Nacional del SIDA of the Chilean Health Ministry."

This study aimed at demonstrating the social stigma experienced by these patients in Iran. This is a qualitative study using a content analysis approach with references to primary and secondary sources. The data were collected through 15 unstructured and in-depth interviews conducted in 2014. By analyzing the data, two main themes were noted: extrinsic concepts of social stigma (causing reprehension, embarrassment, and discrimination) and intrinsic concepts of social stigma (sense of rejection, isolation, and frustration). The analysis of participants' experiences showed that social stigma is a simple lack of knowledge among the patients and society and it is more intense in the first days after the diagnosis. Stigma is prevalent among patients with hepatitis B virus, causes them to hide the disease, and provokes various complications for them as well as society. This study emphasizes the necessity of implementing health education programs about hepatitis B and its associated stigma, especially considering the potential impact of a mass media campaign."

Therefore, appropriate case management is required for better patient retention; however, which intervention in case management is important has not been fully investigated. Meanwhile, in Japan, each local government is required to organize mental health services for patients with HIV so that a case manager at an HIV care facility can utilize them, but little is known about the association between implementation of the services and loss to follow-up. Therefore, we investigated that by a nested case-control study."

In the current study, the authors re-analyzed data derived from a previously published retrospective study of HIV-1-infected individuals at Lampang Hospital in northern Thailand. According to the Cox proportional hazard model, compared to asymptomatic patients with a high CD4+ cell count (> 200 cell/microl), the mortality rate of asymptomatic patients with a medium CD4+ cell count (100-199 cell/microl) did not significantly differ. However, the mortality rate of patients with a CD4+ cell count below 100 cell/microl was at least 16 times higher, regardless of the presence of clinical symptoms. Based on these results, the authors produced a Lampang Hospital guideline of antiretroviral drug use; priority of antiretroviral therapy should, therefore, be given to patients with CD4+ cell count < 100 cell/microl."

4726,0.01,2.0000,"The number of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is gradually increasing in Japan, and the morbidity rate from tuberculosis in the Japanese people is high. Accordingly, the number of cases with both infections is considered to increase in the future. Our hospital has already encountered 31 cases of HIV associated tuberculosis. HIV infects mainly CD4-positive cells. The extreme decrease in the cell count results in serious cellular immunological disorder. CD4-positive cell disorder induces disorders of B lymphocytes, cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophage functions. These destructive conditions show the state of immunodeficiency including macrophage that are most important for defense of acid-fast bacterial infection. Migration and activation of macrophages with cytokines derived from T cells are impaired to induce the following phenomena: hypoplasia of granuloma, failure of tubercule bacillus suppression, the spread to regional lymph nodes (hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes), and hematogenous dissemination. On this occasion, caseous necrosis and cavitation are unlikely to occur, and false-negative tuberculin reaction is often observed. The incidence of severe cases, which include miliary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, etc., and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, are high among acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated tuberculosis cases. HIV-infected tuberculosis cases are generally regarded as endogenous exacerbation, but they include primary infection and reinfection as well. Even during the treatment for drug-sensitive strains particularly, some cases may have reinfection with multidrug-resistant bacteria, suggesting that caution should be taken against this point. Conversely, the association of tuberculosis is a factor for the poor prognosis of HIV infection, since it facilitates the development of HIV infection. If the bacteria belong to a drug-sensitive strain, the infection with them responds well to antituberculous drugs, the same as in tuberculosis cases without HIV infection, showing a favorable prognosis. However, the mortality rate of infection with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis is extremely high. The combined use of a protease inhibitor, i.e., anti-HIV drug, with rifampicin is regarded as contraindication for the treatment because rifampicin strongly induces hepatic cytochrome P-450 and increases the metabolism of protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptases to markedly decrease the blood concentrations. Accordingly, the treatment for tuberculosis should take priority over that for HIV infection in HIV-infected tuberculosis, and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may be administered after the treatment of tuberculosis. When HAART is necessary for the treatment during the tuberculosis treatment, rifampicin had better be exchanged to rifabutin because the effect of rifabutin to induce cytochrome P-450 is less potent than that of rifampicin. A report has recently shown that the exacerbation of pyrexia and chest X-ray findings was transiently observed approximately 2 weeks after potent anti-HIV therapy for HIV-infected tuberculosis, which included a protease inhibitor. The reason for the exacerbation has been believed to be that the impaired function of CD4-positive cells is improved by the administration of anti-HIV drugs to raise temporarily the reaction of the vital part to M. tuberculosis. A tuberculin skin test (TST) reaction size of > or = 5 mm of induration is considered positive (i.e., indicative of M. tuberculosis infection) in persons who are infected with HIV. Persons with a TST reaction size > or = 5 mm who have not previously received treatment for M. tuberculosis infection should receive tuberculosis preventive treatment. Prevention by BCG vaccination is regarded as contraindications for HIV-infected patients, because disseminated M. bovis infection may be associated with them. Many HIV-positive patients infected with tuberculosis show uneventful healing, when M. tuberculosis is the sensitive strain. However, since some patients show the rapid course of tuberculosis, clinical physicians keep the early detection of tuberculosis for HIV-infected patients and the association of HIV infection for tuberculosis patients in their mind, respectively."
7424,0.01,2.0000,"Tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are two important linked public health problems in the world of today. Tuberculosis in HIV infected patients is frequently atypical in its clinical and radiological findings and commonly has an extrapulmonary dissemination. Atypical mycobacteriosis have also been reported in patients with HIV infection. We review here all the patients admitted from 1986 to 1991 with definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis and HIV infection at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City. Out of 220 patients with HIV infection and pulmonary complications, 19 had proven tuberculosis. Their mean age was 34 +/- 8 years and seven were homosexual males. In 16 patients (84%), respiratory symptoms (cough with sputum) and fever were the first manifestations of the HIV infection. Only two patients had the typical cavitary lesions but also coexisting with miliary tuberculosis. The rest had several types of non cavitated pulmonary opacities or other thoracic or pleural alterations. Eleven patients (58%) had, in addition, extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured in 11 of 12 patients but no atypical mycobacteria were isolated. Only seven of the 19 patients completed at least six months of treatment and two of them relapsed. Three patients died in their first admission; the rest were lost in the follow up.

6857,0.01,2.0000,"The magnitude of intestinal parasitic infection in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients requires careful consideration in the developing world where poor nutrition is associated with poor hygiene and several tropical diseases. However, there have been very few studies addressing this issue in Cameroon. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis in HIV/AIDS patients in Dschang -Cameroon. Stool and blood specimens from HIV/AIDS patients and control group were screened respectively for intestinal parasites and for HIV antibodies. Intestinal parasites were identified using direct microscopy, formalin-ether concentration and Ziehl Neelsen methods. Out of 396 participants recruited among patients consulting at hospital, 42 (10.6%) were HIV positive, thirty of them treatment naïve. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites was 14.64%. Out of 42 HIV/AIDS patients, 59.5% (25/42) were infected with intestinal parasites, while only 9.32% (33/354) of the HIV negative patients were infected with intestinal parasites. The parasites detected in our study population included Crystosporidium parvum (2.53%), Entamoeba histolytica (7.52%), Entamoeba coli (4.04%), Giardia lamblia (0.25%), Trichuris trichura (0.25%), Strongyloides stercoralis (0.25%) and Taenia spp. (0.25%). In the HIV infected group, Crystosporidium parvum (19.04%), Entamoeba histolytica (19.04%), Entamoeba coli (21.42%), Giardia lamblia (2.38%), Strongyloides stercoralis (0.25%) and Taenia spp. (0.25%) were found. Crystosporidium parvum was found to be significantly higher in HIV/AIDS patients than in controls (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the HIV status and the quality of water were the major risk factors for intestinal parasitosis. Routine examinations of stool samples for parasites would significantly benefit the HIV patients by contributing in reducing morbidity and improving the efficiency of antiretroviral treatment. Even after the introduction of free anti-retroviral drugs, opportunistic intestinal infections are still a threat. HIV patients should be screened routinely for intestinal parasites and treated for their overall well being."

For each individual patient, the ideal time to start antiretroviral therapy must be carefully selected. The individual risk of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on the one hand, and the risks of long-term toxicity and adherence problems under therapy on the other hand must be taken into account.

9894,0.01,2.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy has dramatically reduced mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In 1988, the suggestion that the first antiretroviral drug, zidovudine, was the potential cause of muscle pathology in HIV-infected persons resulted in structural and biochemical patient studies demonstrating acquired mitochondrial dysfunction. Assessment of subsequent nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) antiretroviral drugs has indicated that mitochondria are a common target of NRTI toxicity in multiple tissues, leading to a wide variety of pathology ranging from lipodystrophy to neuropathy. Overwhelmingly, these complications have emerged during post-licensing human studies. Subsequent animal and in vitro studies have then elucidated the potential pathological mechanisms, suggesting that NRTI-associated mitochondrial toxicity arises principally from inhibition of the sole mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma, leading to a reduction in mtDNA content (depletion). Millions of patients have been treated with mitochondrially toxic NRTIs and these drugs remain the backbone of antiretroviral rollout in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Here we describe the 25-year history of antiretroviral associated mitochondrial pathology and critically review the strength of evidence linking clinical, histopathological, and molecular data. We discuss recently described novel mechanisms of NRTI-associated mitochondrial damage and whether or not recently licensed NRTIs may be considered free from mitochondrial toxicity. "
4890,0.01,2.0000,"There is limited information available about the prevalence and pattern of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance mutations (DRMs) among antiretroviral therapy (ART) experienced patients from northern India. Results of genotypic drug resistance testing were obtained from plasma samples of 128 patients, who had presented with clinical or immunological failure to treatment after at least six months of ART. Major DRMs associated with any of the three classes of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI), were seen in 120 out of 128 patients (93.8% prevalence). NRTI and NNRTI DRMs were each seen in 115/128 (89.8%) patients, with M184V, M41L, D67N and T215Y being the most frequent among NRTI associated mutations, and K103N, G190A, Y181C and A98G among NNRTI associated ones. PI DRMs were observed in 14/128 (10.9%) patients, with L10I, V82A and L89V being the commonest. These results present a high prevalence of DRMs among ART experienced patients from northern India with clinical or immunological failure of therapy. It emphasizes the need for regular testing of plasma samples of such patients for DRMs in order to detect and replace a failing regimen early, and also the use of HIV drug resistance genotyping of ART naive individuals prior to initiating first line ART for possible transmitted resistance. It is very important to enhance the access of patients to ARV drugs so that their compliance could be improved and hence development of DRMs be minimized."

A retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU was undertaken. Outcomes in the pre-HAART era (1990-June 1996), early- (July 1996-2002), and recent-HAART (2003-2008) periods and total HAART era (July 1996-2008) were analysed and compared with those reported of the general population. A total of 127 ICU admissions were included. The 1-year mortality decreased from 71% in the pre-HAART era to 50% in the recent-HAART period (p = 0.06). The 5-year mortality decreased from 87% in the pre-HAART era to 59% in the early-HAART period (p = 0.005). Independent predictors of 1-year mortality in the HAART era were age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.16 [95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-1.27]), APACHE II score > 20 (6.04 [1.25-29.22]) and mechanical ventilation (40.01 [3.01-532.65]). The 5-year survival after hospitalisation was 80% and in the range of the reported survival of non-HIV-infected patients (83.7%). Predictors of 1-year mortality for HIV patients admitted to the ICU in the HAART era were all non-HIV-related. Short- and long-term outcome has improved since the introduction of HAART and is comparable to the outcome data in non-HIV-infected ICU patients."
3797,0.01,2.0000,"The cellular immune response of seven rhesus macaques immunized with Tween-ether-treated macaque strain of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVMAC) and three non-vaccinated control animals was investigated. Immunization elicited antigen-specific proliferating CD4+ cells in five of seven monkeys. Proliferating T cells were found in all animals protected from a first virus challenge. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were not induced by the immunization. After the second challenge, the four formerly protected animals became infected, despite a strong proliferative CD4+ cell activity in three of them. All animals lost their proliferative activity 2 weeks after infection. After the first challenge four of the six infected animals exhibited a CTL response and after the second challenge, one of four newly infected macaques acquired a CTL response. The five animals with a CTL activity against SIVMAC proteins were protected from severe thrombocytopenia, which appeared in the five CTL-negative animals after infection. Our data show the induction of proliferative T cells by immunization with soluble SIVMAC antigen. This T cell reactivity was found in all animals protected from the first virus challenge, but did not confer protection from the second challenge. Interestingly, the proliferative T cell reactivity disappeared 2 weeks after virus infection. Furthermore a CTL response against viral proteins seems to protect infected animals from severe thrombocytopenia which is an early sign of AIDS in monkeys."
2841,0.01,2.0000,"Although T cell immunity is important in the control of HIV-1 infection, the characteristics of effective HIV-specific T cell responses are unclear. We previously observed protection from virulent SHIV challenges in macaques administered priming with DNA vaccines and boosting with recombinant fowlpox viruses expressing shared SIV Gag antigens. We therefore performed a detailed kinetic and phenotypic study of the T cell immunity induced by these vaccines prior to and following SHIV challenge utilizing intracellular cytokine staining. Pigtail macaques vaccinated intramuscularly with DNA/recombinant fowlpox virus exhibited a coordinated induction of first Gag-specific CD4 T cell responses and then a week later Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses following the fowlpox virus boost. Overall, the magnitude and timing of the peak CD8 T cell responses following challenge was significantly associated with reductions in SHIV viremia following pathogenic challenge. After pathogenic lentiviral challenge, virus-specific effector memory T cells derived from animals controlling SHIV infection recognized a broad array of epitopes, expressed multiple effector cytokines and rapidly recognized virus-exposed cells ex vivo. These results shed light on some of the requirements for T cells in the control of pathogenic lentiviral infections."
1454,0.01,2.0000,"Little research has been conducted in less wealthy nations to evaluate the prevalence of severe life traumas in general population groups and the impact of such traumas. Previous studies in wealthy nations have found that experiencing severe traumas can cause elevated levels of anxiety, but few studies have examined this association in non-disaster situations in less wealthy nations. Trauma and trauma-related anxiety are associated with greater sexual risk taking behaviours, lower HIV medication adherence levels and poorer health outcomes in wealthy nations. The objectives of this manuscript are: (1) to compare rates of trauma in two HIV-positive samples from areas that have not experienced disaster situations that are recognized by the international community as traumatic events; and (2) to examine whether the reported traumatic experiences are similarly associated with self-reported mental and physical health. The samples come from a region of a wealthy nation that consistently experiences large increases in incident AIDS cases and where the epidemic is largely transmitted heterosexually (Deep South, United States; n =611) and a region in a less wealthy nation with relatively high HIV prevalence and incidence rates and where transmission is also primarily heterosexual (Moshi, Tanzania; n =72). Compared to the US sample, the Tanzanian sample reported significantly higher rates of trauma in the areas of illness, injury, accidents and ""other"" significant traumas, a higher prevalence of anxiety and poorer physical health. The experience of trauma was similarly associated with greater mental health symptomatology and poorer physical health in both samples. Further investigation into the area of trauma and its sequelae is warranted, particularly in relation to risk behaviours and HIV medication adherence. At a time of increasing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in less wealthy nations, additional focus on trauma care could improve ART adherence rates and reduce risk behaviors, thereby assisting in stemming the further spread of the epidemic."
10006,0.01,2.0000,"In the present prospective study, five blood tests for detection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) for detection of early (immediate-early antigen) and late (pp67) mRNA, PCR for detection of HCMV DNA (DNA PCR), culture, and pp65 antigenemia assay, and culture and DNA PCR of urine and throat swab specimens were compared for their abilities to predict the development of disease caused by HCMV (HCMV disease). Of 101 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with </=100 CD4(+) lymphocytes per mm(3), 25 patients developed HCMV disease. The pp65 antigenemia assay (sensitivity, 50%; specificity, 89%) and DNA PCR of blood (sensitivity, 69%; specificity, 75%) were most accurate in predicting the development of HCMV disease within the next 12 months. Both blood culture and late pp67 mRNA NASBA had high specificities (91 and 90%, respectively) but low sensitivities (25 and 13%, respectively). The sensitivities of urine culture, DNA PCR, throat swab specimen culture, DNA PCR, and NASBA of blood for detection of the immediate-early antigen were 73, 87, 53, 67, and 63%, respectively, and the specificities were 58, 46, 76, 60, and 72%, respectively. The positive predictive values of all tests however, were low and did not exceed 50%. In conclusion, virological screening by these qualitative assays for detection of HCMV is of limited value for prediction of the development of HCMV disease in HIV-infected patients."

2608,0.01,2.0000,"Both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are important global public health problems with shared transmission routes. Although HIV/HCV coinfection is not uncommon, the prevalence rates vary significantly across different studies and regions. In Taiwan, injection drug users have become the major contributors to the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 2005. Because the prevalence of HCV infection is high in injection drug users, this HIV epidemic is also associated with a significant increase of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan. To control Taiwan's HIV epidemic, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) launched a harm-reduction program in 2006. The HIV epidemic, the percentage attributed to injection drug users, and the prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection gradually declined thereafter. In this article, we aimed to thoroughly examine the current literatures of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan and hope to provide a better understanding of the needs for the management of this coinfection. We conducted a narrative review and searched for literature from PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library database untill August 2015. Studies relevant to the epidemiology and associated risk factors of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan were examined and discussed."
847,0.01,2.0000,"The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) positivity among blood donors from Chengdu, China, and to determine risk factors associated with infection. In this study, data were collected from volunteer blood donors between July 2006 and June 2007. Anti-HCV test was performed in 119,518 donors. To identify risk factors associated with HCV infections a case-control study was conducted in 305 unique HCV-seropositive blood donors and 610 seronegative donors matched for age and sex. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using logistic regression. The population attributable risk (PAR) to risk factor was estimated according to the Bruzzi's formula. The prevalence of anti-HCV positivity was 0.53% (95% CI: 0.489-0.572%). The final multivariate model included the following independent HCV risk factors: razor sharing (OR=29.16; 95% CI: 12.89-66.00), blood transfusion (OR=20.84; 95% CI: 3.76-115.45), acupuncture (OR=8.01; 95% CI: 3.16-20.30), a history of hospitalization, injections >10 years earlier, a family history of hepatitis B, dental treatment, and ear piercing. The PAR of risk factors are 68.4%, 6.3%, 14.1%, 23.1%, 29.5%, 29.3%, 38.9%, and 27.8%, respectively, and the total PAR is 98.3%. Infection with HCV among blood donors in Chengdu is associated with iatrogenic risk factors and beauty treatment-related risk. Razor sharing is an important risk factor for HCV infection. These results indicate that infection control measures in healthcare settings may reduce the burden of HCV infection and there is a need for development of effective educational programs to improve HCV knowledge among beauty culture professionals, barber cosmetologists, and the general public to avoid risk behaviors."
5780,0.01,2.0000,"The morphologic evolution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) liver disease in 45 hepatic allograft recipients who were HBV surface-antigen positive (HBs-Ag+) at the time of liver replacement and who survived for more than 60 days was studied by routine histologic and immunocytochemical analysis of serial pathology specimens. The findings in these patients were compared to a control group of 30 individuals who were immune to the HBV (anti-HBs antibody positive), but required hepatic replacement for other reasons. Eight of the forty-five (18%) HBsAg-positive patients have no serologic evidence of HBV reinfection after transplantation. All 37 remaining patients are reinfected; 21 (47%) developed chronic active hepatitis and/or cirrhosis, 3 (7%) developed submassive necrosis, and 6 (14%) developed chronic lobular hepatitis. One patient lost her graft to chronic rejection, despite reinfection with the B virus. Four other patients (9%) developed a chronic carrier state. No long-term follow-up biopsies were available in the remaining two patients. The histologic features associated with dysfunction related to recurrent HBV infection evolved from an acute to chronic phase and were similar to hepatitis B seen in nonallografted livers. Furthermore HBV-related lesions could be separated from rejection using routine histology alone. The only exception to this conclusion was the occurrence of a peculiar HBV-related lesion in two recipients, described herein. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of viral antigens in almost all cases. Hepatic inflammation also was commonly present during HBV disease and consisted mostly of accessory cells and T lymphocytes. Analysis of the effect of major histocompatibility complex matching revealed no clear association between the number of class I or II matches or mismatches and the development, or pattern, of active hepatitis in the allograft. Peculiar pathologic alterations in several of the biopsies and failed allografts after HBV reinfection suggests that, under special circumstances, the B virus may be cytopathic."
9509,0.01,2.0000,"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a potent trans-activator of transcription from the viral LTR promoter. Previous mutagenesis studies have identified domains within Tat responsible for binding to its TAR RNA target and for transcriptional activation. The minimal Tat activation domain is composed of the N-terminal 48 residues, and mutational analyses identified a cluster of critical cysteines. The importance of four highly conserved aromatic amino acids within the activation domain has not been thoroughly investigated. We have systematically substituted these aromatic residues (Y26, F32, F38, Y47) of the HIV-1 LAI Tat protein with other aromatic residues (conservative mutation) or alanine (nonconservative mutation). The activity of the mutant Tat constructs was measured in different cell lines by transfection with a LTR-CAT reporter plasmid. The range of transcriptional activities measured for this set of Tat mutants allowed careful assessment of the level of Tat activity required for optimal viral replication. To test this, the mutant Tat genes were introduced into the pLAI infectious molecular clone and tested for their effect on virus replication in a T-cell line. We found that a twofold reduction in Tat activity already affects viral replication, and no virus replication was measured for Tat mutants with less than 15% activity. This strict correlation between Tat activity and viral replication demonstrates the importance of the Tat function to viral fitness. Interestingly, a less pronounced replication defect was observed in primary cell types. This finding may correlate with the frequent detection of proviruses with Tat-inactivating mutations in clinical samples."
4011,0.01,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains the most common risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Efficient suppression of HBV viremia and necroinflammation as a result of nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment is able to reduce HCC incidence; nevertheless, hepatocarcinogenesis can occur in the absence of active hepatitis, correlating with high HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) levels. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a central player in chronic inflammation and HCC development. However, in the absence of severe chronic inflammation, the role of NF-κB signaling in HCC development remains elusive. As a model of hepatocarcinogenesis driven by accumulation of HBV envelope polypeptides, HBsAg transgenic mice, which show no HBV-specific immune response, were crossed to animals with hepatocyte-specific inhibition of canonical NF-κB signaling. We detected prolonged, severe endoplasmic reticulum stress already at 20 weeks of age in NF-κB-deficient hepatocytes of HBsAg-expressing mice. The unfolded protein response regulator binding immunoglobulin protein/78-kDa glucose-regulated protein was down-regulated, activating transcription factor 6, and eIF2α were activated with subsequent overexpression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein. Notably, immune cell infiltrates and liver transaminases were unchanged. However, as a result of this increased cellular stress, insufficient hepatocyte proliferation due to G1 /S-phase cell cycle arrest with overexpression of p27 and emergence of ductular reactions was detected. This culminated in increased DNA damage already at 20 weeks of age and finally led to 100% HCC incidence due to NF-κB inhibition."
8635,0.01,2.0000,"Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common in resource-limited settings but is frequently not diagnosed. The authors retrospectively tested specimens for HBV in HIV-infected Thai women who had participated in an antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinical study. A substantial proportion (27 of 211; 13%) of HIV-infected women were HBV coinfected. Among HIV/HBV-coinfected women, the authors observed similar rates of antiretroviral-associated liver toxicity (despite nevirapine [NVP] use) and CD4 count reconstitution as observed in HIV-monoinfected women. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening detected the majority (81%) of HBV coinfections, including all 5 HBV-coinfected women who did not suppress HBV despite 48 weeks of lamivudine (3TC)-containing ART and could be used to tailor ART for patients diagnosed with HBV coinfection in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Although HBsAg screening did not diagnose 5 occult HBV coinfections, these women achieved HBV suppression on 3TC-containing ART, suggesting that not detecting occult HBV coinfection would have limited clinical impact.

9467,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by the massive infiltration of secondary lymphoid organs with activated CD8(+) T lymphocytes. While converging data indicated that these cells were HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) responsible for HIV spread limitation, direct evidence was lacking. Here, the presence of HIV-specific effector CTLs was demonstrated directly ex vivo in 15 of 24 microdissected splenic white pulps from an untreated patient and in 1 of 24 tonsil germinal centers from a second patient with incomplete viral suppression following bitherapy. These patients had plasma HIV RNA loads of 5900 and 820 copies per milliliter. The frequencies of HIV-1 DNA(+) cells in their lymphoid organs were more than 1 in 50 and 1 in 175, respectively. Spliced viral messenger RNA (a marker for ongoing viral replication) was present in most immunocompetent structures tested. Conversely, CTL activity was not found in spleens from 2 patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy, with undetectable plasma viral load. These patients had much lower spleen DNA(+) cell frequencies (1 in 2700 and 1 in 3800) and no white pulps containing spliced RNA. CTL effector activity as well as spliced viral messenger RNA were both concentrated in the white pulps and germinal centers. This colocalization indicates that viral replication in immunocompetent structures of secondary lymphoid organs triggers anti-HIV effector CTLs to these particular locations, providing clues to target therapeutic intervention."
2192,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are thought to play a major role in the immune response to HIV infection. The HIV-specific CTL response is much stronger than previously documented in an infectious disease, yet estimates of CTL frequency derived from limiting-dilution analysis (LDA) are relatively low and comparable to other viral infections. Here we show that individual CTL clones specific for peptides from HIV gag and pol gene products are present at high levels in the peripheral blood of three infected patients and that individual CTL clones may represent between 0.2% and 1% of T cells. Previous LDA in one donor had shown a frequency of CTL precursors of 1/8000, suggesting that LDA may underestimate CTL effector frequency. In some donors individual CTL clones persisted in vivo for at least 5 years. In contrast, in one patient there was a switch in CTL usage suggesting that different populations of CTLs can be recruited during infection. These data imply strong stimulation of CTLs, potentially leading some clones to exhaustion."

15,0.01,2.0000,"The great variability of protein sequences from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) isolates represents a major obstacle to the development of an effective vaccine against this virus. The surface protein (Env), which is the predominant target of neutralizing antibodies, is particularly variable. Here we examine the impact of variability among different HIV-1 subtypes (clades) on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activities, the other major component of the antiviral immune response. CTLs are produced not only against Env but also against other structural proteins, as well as some regulatory proteins. The genetic subtypes of HIV-1 were determined for Env and Gag from several patients infected either in France or in Africa. The cross-reactivities of the CTLs were tested with target cells expressing selected proteins from HIV-1 isolates of clade A or B or from HIV type 2 isolates. All African patients were infected with viruses belonging to clade A for Env and for Gag, except for one patient who was infected with a clade A Env-clade G Gag recombinant virus. All patients infected in France were infected with clade B viruses. The CTL responses obtained from all the African and all the French individuals tested showed frequent cross-reactions with proteins of the heterologous clade. Epitopes conserved between the viruses of clades A and B appeared especially frequent in Gag p24, Gag p18, integrase, and the central region of Nef. Cross-reactivity also existed among Gag epitopes of clades A, B, and G, as shown by the results for the patient infected with the clade A Env-clade G Gag recombinant virus. These results show that CTLs raised against viral antigens from different clades are able to cross-react, emphasizing the possibility of obtaining cross-immunizations for this part of the immune response in vaccinated individuals."
3280,0.01,2.0000,"Cryptosporidium spp. is a major cause of diarrhea in developing countries, mainly affecting people with compromised immune systems in general and HIV-infected individuals with low CD4 + T-cell counts in particular. This infection is self-limiting in healthy persons; however, it can be severe, progressive and persistent in those who are immunocompromised. There are few published studies concerning cryptosporidiosis and Cryptosporidium genotypes in Iranian immunocompromised patients and none of them describe risk factors. This study was undertaken to identify prevalence, genotypes and risk factors for cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised patients. Three fecal samples were obtained at two day intervals from each of the 183 patients and processed with modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining methods and 18S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. The overall infection prevalence was 6%. Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in isolates from five HIV-infected patients, one patient who had undergone bone marrow transplantation and one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cryptosporidium hominis was identified in isolates from two HIV-infected patients and two patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. According to univariate analysis, the statistically significant factors were diarrhea (OR = 21.7, CI = 2.83-78.4, P= 0.003), CD4 + lymphocytes less than 100 cells/mm(3) (OR = 41.3, CI = 13.45-114.8, P < 0.0001), other microbial infections (OR = 7.1321.7, CI = 1.97-25.73, P = 0.006), weight loss (OR = 73.78, CI = 15.5-350, P < 0.0001), abdominal pain (OR = 10.29, CI = 2.81-37.74.4, P= 0.001), dehydration (OR = 72.1, CI = 17.6-341.5, P < 0.0001), vomiting (OR = 4.87, CI = 1.4-16.9, P= 0.015), nausea (OR = 9.4, CI = 2.38-37.2, P < 0.001), highly active antiretroviral therapy (OR = 0.089, CI = 0.01-0.8, P= 0.015) and diarrhea in household members (OR = 7.37, CI = 2.04-26.66, P= 0.001). After multivariate analysis and a backward deletion process, only < 100 CD4 + T-lymphocytes/mm(3) maintained a significant association with infection. The authors recommend that this infection should be suspected in patients with diarrhea, weight loss and dehydration in general and in diarrheal individuals with < 100 CD4 + T-lymphocytes/mm(3)."
9196,0.01,2.0000,"Because of the increasing availability of antiretroviral (ARV) agents for HIV in low-income countries, many clinicians now need training on their use. This is especially true for clinicians caring for individuals with tuberculosis (TB), given its close relationship with HIV/AIDS. This article summarizes the key decisions facing clinicians who manage HIV-infected persons, with particular reference to issues regarding those dually infected with TB. Health care provider-initiated diagnostic testing using rapid HIV tests should be offered to all individuals with symptoms and signs suggesting HIV infection, including all persons with TB. Issues to be included in pre- and post-test counseling sessions are discussed. HIV-infected patients should be evaluated to determine clinical staging of HIV; certain laboratory examinations should ideally be performed to assess the degree of immunosuppression and to aid decisions about when best to start ARV therapy and preventive therapies. The recommended ARV regimens and guidance on proposed patient follow-up are presented. Good adherence to ARVs is required and factors that induce and reinforce compliance are suggested. The treatment of TB is a high priority, and follows the same principles whether the patient is HIV-infected or not. Suggestions are made about ARV use in patients with TB. A standardized and complementary information system should be developed to monitor management of HIV-TB patients and performance of joint TB and HIV care efforts. By diagnosing and managing additional HIV cases detected through the portal of the TB control programme, clinicians will contribute to diminishing the burden of HIV, and thus, TB."
619,0.01,2.0000,"The introduction of enfuvirtide (FUZEON) represents an important advance in the treatment of therapy-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection. However, parenteral self-administration, and the advanced disease and antiretroviral experience of patients currently most needing enfuvirtide introduce unique usage considerations. Enfuvirtide has been shown to provide clinically relevant improvements in CD4 cell counts and reductions in HIV viraemia across all subgroups of treatment-experienced patients studied, including those taking few or no other active drugs. However, optimal outcome results from initiation when the CD4 cell count is above 100 x 10(6) cells/l and viraemia below 1 x 10(5) copies/ml, as part of a newly constructed third or fourth antiretroviral regimen in combination with one or two other antiretrovirals to which the virus remains sensitive. Resistance testing should be used where available to guide background drug selection. Where insufficient options for an effective background exist, enfuvirtide should still be considered and treatment undertaken with the aim of achieving an immunological or clinical response, despite the unlikelihood of a sustained virological outcome. Similarly, where there is no viable alternative treatment, enfuvirtide should be continued following virological failure wherever ongoing immunological or clinical benefit is discerned. Injection site reactions (ISRs) are common on enfuvirtide and will affect almost all patients. ISRs are manageable and seldom activity- or treatment-limiting. Bacterial pneumonia and systemic hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported uncommonly. A structured series of patient visits with a healthcare professional provides an atmosphere of ongoing training and support that may prevent 'injection fatigue', maintain adherence and minimise the incidence of ISRs. An initial investment in establishing such procedures can be expected to yield significant returns in patient confidence and benefit on enfuvirtide."

In addition, 1440 specimens from the patients attending STD clinic of the same hospital and 862 females seeking termination of pregnancy from a near by hospital were included for comparison. It was found that only 3 individuals with high risk behaviours out of 2002 females attending antenatal clinic showed evidence of HIV infection (rate 1.49 per 1000). The corresponding rate for the group of patients attending STD clinic and seeking termination of pregnancy were 3 out of 1440 (rate 2.15 per 1000) and 1 out of 862 (rate 1.16 per 1000) respectively. It was noted that prevalence of HIV infection in the hospital attending population with unspecified risk factor (medical, surgical and antenatal clinics) was not a matter of serious concern. The importance of finding out risk factors in females attending antenatal clinic is evident from the study."
2186,0.01,2.0000,"A successful pregnancy is characterised by an increase in Th2 cytokines and suppression of Th1 cytokine production. A Th1 to Th2 cytokine shift is also observed in the disease progression of HIV infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) suppresses HIV viremia, increases CD4+ cell counts and counteracts the Th1 to Th2 shift. We hypothesised that the increased risk of premature delivery reported in HIV-infected, HAART-treated pregnant women is mediated through changes in the cytokine environment in pregnancy. Here, we present results relating to levels of interleukin (IL)-2 (Th1) and IL-10 (Th2) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) measured three times during pregnancy in 49 HIV-infected women. Slope values representing the trend of repeated cytokine (IL-2-PHA, IL-2-Env, IL-10-PHA and IL-10-Env) measurements within women during pregnancy were estimated and median values compared by prematurity and HAART use. Multiple regression adjusted for HAART and cytokine slope clarified the additional and independent effect of HAART on prematurity risk. Results showed favourable immunomodulation induced by HAART with increased IL-2 and decreased IL-10. HAART use and IL-10-Env slopes were not significantly associated with prematurity risk, but each unit increase in IL-2-PHA slope was associated with an 8% increased risk of premature delivery (AOR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.0-1.17; p=0.005). HAART use in pregnancy provides significant benefits in delaying HIV disease progression and reducing the risk of mother-to-child-transmission, but may be counterproductive in terms of successful pregnancy outcome."
5077,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global problem and the world has 350 million carriers of chronic hepatitis B. Over 50 % of these have acquired their infection vertically from their mothers (mother-to-child transmission [MTCT]). Majority (>90 %) of vertically-acquired infection results into chronic infection, due to induction of an immune-tolerant state. Hence, management of chronic HBV during pregnancy and strategies to prevent MTCT would go a long way in global control of HBV infection and the morbidity and mortality associated with it. However, chronic HBV infection in pregnancy presents a unique challenge, because of existence of a complex relationship between the physiological changes of pregnancy and the pathophysiological response of body to HBV. This relationship may lead to a varied presentation of the patient to the doctor depending on the period of her pregnancy and stage of her liver disease. Each of these modes of presentation raises issues that need to be addressed for successful maternal and fetal outcome, including prevention of MTCT of HBV. This review will try to give a practical approach in addressing these issues."
2231,0.01,2.0000,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been associated with increased rates of single- and multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis in the New York City area. In order to examine the relationship of HIV infection to drug-resistant tuberculosis in other selected regions of the United States, we established a registry of cases of culture-proven tuberculosis. Data were collected from sites participating in an NIH-funded, community-based HIV clinical trials group. All cases of tuberculosis, regardless of HIV status, which occurred between January 1992 and June 1994 were recorded. Overall, 1,373 cases of tuberculosis were evaluated, including 425 from the New York City area, and 948 from seven other metropolitan areas. The overall prevalence of resistance to one or more drugs was 20.4%, and 5.6% of isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (MDR). In the New York City area, HIV-infected patients were significantly more likely than persons not known to be HIV-infected, to have resistance to at least one drug (37% versus 19%) and MDR (19% versus 6%). In other geographic areas, overall drug resistance was 16%, and only 2.2% of isolates were MDR. In multiple logistic regression analyses, HIV infection was shown to be a risk factor for drug-resistant tuberculosis, independent of geographic location, history of prior therapy, age, and race. We concluded that HIV infection is associated with increased rates of resistance to antituberculosis drugs in both the New York City area and other geographic areas. MDR tuberculosis is occurring predominantly in the New York City area and is highly correlated with HIV infection."
5360,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major causes of viral hepatitis worldwide. Despite the prevalence of HBV infection in Egypt, few studies have focused on sub-genotyping of the virus. Moreover, no studies are available regarding the mutational analysis of the preS1/preS2 region of the viral genome, or its impact on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in Egypt. In this study, we have analyzed the sub-genotypes and incidence of mutations in the preS1/preS2 region of HBV present in HBV-infected patients, from Mansoura city (located in the center of Nile Delta region of Egypt), via partial sequencing of this specific region. Moreover, we have investigated the impact of these mutations on HCC development by measuring serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level and abdominal ultrasound examination of the HBV-infected patients. According to our results, all samples were genotype D in which sub-genotype D1 was predominant. In addition, the results revealed mutations in the preS1/preS2 region, which could result in either immature preS1 protein or completely inhibit the translation of the preS2 protein. However, there was no incidence of HCC development in patients infected with mutated HBV in the preS1/preS2 region. In summary, for the first time our work has proved the predominance of sub-genotype D1 among HBV-infected Egyptian patients in Mansoura city, Nile Delta region, Egypt, and incidence of mutations in the preS1/preS2 region of HBV genome. This current study opens up research opportunities to discuss the impact of HBV mutations on the development of HCC in Egypt."

Protease and partial reverse transcriptase regions were retrotranscribed from plasma HIV-1 RNA and sequenced after direct nested PCR. Principal antiretroviral resistance mutations (ARM) were observed in 3% of the samples, two cases with K103N and one with M41L, L210W and T215Y, all in HIV-1 clade B infected men. At protease region, no principal mutations were observed, but polymorphisms at secondary codons were frequent. Contrary to other areas in the country where clade B dominates, HIV-1 clade C genomes predominated in this study (58%), clade B (32%) and clade F1 (3%). Of the genomes clustering in clade C, almost half (43%) had a small clade B segment at reverse transcriptase, forming a sub-cluster within clade C with a similar recombinant structure and carrying new amino acid signatures. Other mosaic genomes were also observed (7%). The low prevalence of resistance mutations is consistent with previous observations at this geographical location but the high frequency of HIV-1 clade C and CB mosaics seems pre-eminent and warns close monitoring."

Three of the five patients developed TB that was resistant to rifampin alone; no mutation in the region of the rpoB gene was detected by a line probe assay in two of the isolates from these patients.

All patients harbored HIV-1 LTR quasispecies corresponding to the B subtype. Three patients with high CD4+ T cell counts (>500/mm3) presented LTR sequences with point mutations in the TAR bulge. The LTR sequence from a patient classified as a long-term nonprogressor (LTNP) presented the most frequent naturally occurring length polymorphism (MFNLP) and two substitutions in the TAR region that were predicted to result in two alternative secondary RNA structures. A novel 18-bp deletion, which eliminates part of the putative binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT-1), was identified in the overlapping nef/LTR sequence derived from a patient progressing to AIDS. This deletion coincides with the ability of this virus to consistently replicate at low levels in vivo (viral load <500 RNA copies/ml) and in vitro (unsuccessful virus isolation). On one occasion, when virus isolation was successful, the 18-bp deletion was no longer evident and LTR sequences with intact NFAT-1-binding sites were observed. Inoculation of hu-PBL-SCID mice with viruses from several Mexican patients resulted in differential CD4+ T cell depletion patterns 15 days postinfection, which agree with the in vivo CD4+ T cell count data from each patient."

In this work, we developed and validated an UPLC-Tandem mass spectrometry assay method capable of monitoring lamivudine, telbivudine, tenofovir and entecavir plasma concentrations. Both standards and quality controls (high, medium and low) were prepared in human plasma. Each sample was added with internal standard (5'amino-5'deoxy-thymidine) and then drugs were extracted through a protein precipitation protocol with acetonitrile+0.1% formic acid and then dried. The extracts were resuspended in water and then injected into the chromatographic system. The chromatographic separation was performed on an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 1.8 μm 2.1 × 150 mm column, with a gradient of water and acetonitrile, both added with formic acid (0.05%). Accuracy, intra-day and inter-day precision at quality controls levels fitted all FDA guidelines for all analytes, while matrix effects and recoveries resulted stable between samples for each analyte. Finally, we tested this method by monitoring plasma concentrations in 30 HBV+ patients with good results. This simple analytical method could represent a useful tool for the management of anti-HBV therapy."
6042,0.01,2.0000,"Increased concentrations of neopterin, a marker for cell-mediated immune activation, and decreased numbers of CD4+ T cells, are predictors for progression of disease after infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Previous studies have demonstrated different rates of onset of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) for groups of patients, defined by laboratory marker values, who were initially symptom-free. By re-analysis of one such study, we demonstrate how for an individual patient, the individual marker values, together with a prior risk estimate, can be converted into current or accumulated post-test probability of onset of AIDS at a certain time. We used a statistical technique suggested by Albert et al. (Clin Chem 1984;30:69-76), which allows incorporation of fixed and time-dependent covariates. Besides allowing individual projections, the method shows that the predictive abilities of CD4+ T cell numbers and of neopterin concentrations do not vary greatly with regard to time of observation; both laboratory markers independently modulate the underlying prior probability of AIDS onset, which is significantly increased with the passage of time."
615,0.01,2.0000,"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a key molecule of the innate immune system and a competent to bind carbohydrates of a variety of microorganisms, resulting in complement activation and opsonophagocytosis against various pathogens. However, there is no systemic investigation on the MBL's role in innate immune responses against HIV-1 infection among northern Han Chinese. This study investigated the association between MBL and HIV-1 infection susceptibility among northern Han Chinese. A total of 91 HIV-1 infected patients and 91 HIV-1 seronegative healthy individuals were recruited. Six polymorphisms of MBL2 gene were genotyped by pyrosequencing. The quantitative measurement of serum MBL concentration and MBL complex activity were performed by ELISA. The CD4+ T-cell counts were determined by flow cytometry. The plasma viral loads of 91 HIV-1 infected patients were determined by bDNA method. The results show that there is an association between MBL and HIV-1 infection susceptibility among northern Han Chinese. The individuals with B variant, low serum MBL concentration and low MBL complex activity are more susceptible to HIV-1 infection."
9724,0.01,2.0000,"There is limited knowledge about how to treat and interpret results from genotypic resistance assays in HIV-2 infection. Here, genetic variation in HIV-2 pol gene was studied in 20 of 23 known HIV-2 cases in Sweden. Five patients with signs of virological treatment failure were longitudinally studied. Clinical, virological and immunological data were collected and the protease (PR) and first half of the reverse transcriptase (RT) was amplified and directly sequenced from plasma samples. Moderate to extensive genetic evolution was observed in four of the five patients who failed treatment. Some mutations occurred at positions known to confer resistance in HIV-1, but many occurred at other positions in PR and RT. All patients had been treated with zidovudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, but none displayed a mutation at position 215, which is the primary zidovudine resistance site in HIV-1. Instead, a E219D mutation evolved in virus from two patients and a Q151M mutation evolved in two other patients. A M184V mutation indicative of lamivudine resistance was detected in three patients. The virus of one patient who had been treated with ritonavir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir successively acquired nine unusual mutations in the protease gene, most of which are not considered primary or secondary resistance mutations in HIV-1. Our data indicate that the evolutionary pathways that lead to antiretroviral resistance in HIV-2 and HIV-1 exhibit both similarities and differences. Genotypic HIV-2 resistance assays cannot be interpreted using algorithms developed for HIV-1, instead new algorithms specific for HIV-2 have to be developed."
4454,0.01,2.0000,"Liver fibrosis is common, particularly in individuals who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV-infected individuals have excess congestive heart failure (CHF) risk compared with uninfected people. It remains unknown whether liver fibrosis stage influences the CHF risk or if HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection modifies this association. Our objectives were to assess whether 1) stage of liver fibrosis is independently associated with incident CHF and 2) the association between stage of liver fibrosis and incident CHF is modified by HIV/HCV status. Participants alive on or after April 1, 2003, in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study were included. Those without prevalent cardiovascular disease were followed until their first CHF event, death, last follow-up date, or December 31, 2011. Liver fibrosis was measured using the fibrosis 4 index (FIB-4), which is calculated using age, aminotransferases, and platelets. Cox proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors. Among 96,373 participants over 6.9 years, 3844 incident CHF events occurred. FIB-4 between 1.45 and 3.25 (moderate fibrosis) and FIB-4 > 3.25 (advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis) were associated with CHF (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.17 [1.07-1.27] and 1.65 [1.43-1.92], respectively). The association of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis and incident CHF persisted regardless of HIV/HCV status."
5114,0.01,2.0000,"A wide range of pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, Mycobacterium, Leishmania, and Helicobacter pylori, can interact with dendritic cell (DC)-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), expressed on DCs and a subset of B cells. More specifically, the interaction of the gp120 envelope protein of HIV-1 with DC-SIGN can facilitate the transfer of virus to CD4+ T lymphocytes in trans and enhance infection. We have previously demonstrated that a multimeric LeX component in human milk binds to DC-SIGN, preventing HIV-1 from interacting with this receptor. Biochemical analysis reveals that the compound is heat resistant, trypsin sensitive, and larger than 100 kDa, indicating a specific glycoprotein as the inhibitory compound. By testing human milk from three different mothers, we found the levels of DC-SIGN binding and viral inhibition to vary between samples. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization analysis, we identified bile salt-stimulated lipase (BSSL), a Lewis X (LeX)-containing glycoprotein found in human milk, to be the major variant protein between the samples. BSSL isolated from human milk bound to DC-SIGN and inhibited the transfer of HIV-1 to CD4+ T lymphocytes. Two BSSL isoforms isolated from the same human milk sample showed differences in DC-SIGN binding, illustrating that alterations in the BSSL forms explain the differences observed. These results indicate that variations in BSSL lead to alterations in LeX expression by the protein, which subsequently alters the DC-SIGN binding capacity and the inhibitory effect on HIV-1 transfer. Identifying the specific molecular interaction between the different forms may aid in the future design of antimicrobial agents."
868,0.01,2.0000,"The Gag protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) associates with the envelope protein complex during virus assembly. The available evidence indicates that this interaction involves recognition of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail (CT) by the matrix protein (MA) region of Pr55(Gag). Here we show that substitution of Asp for Leu at position 49 (L49D) in MA results in a specific reduction in particle-associated gp120 without affecting the levels of gp41. Mutant virions were markedly reduced in single-cycle infectivity despite a relatively modest defect in fusion with target cells. Studies with HIV-1 particles containing decreased levels of envelope proteins suggested that the L49D mutation also inhibits a postentry step in infection. Truncation of the gp41 tail, or pseudotyping by vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein, restored both the fusion and infectivity of L49D mutant virions to wild-type levels. Truncation of gp41 also resulted in equivalent levels of gp120 on particles with and without the MA mutation and enhanced the replication of the L49D mutant virus in T cells. The impaired fusion and infectivity of L49D mutant particles were also complemented by a single point mutation in the gp41 CT that disrupted the tyrosine-containing endocytic motif. Our results suggest that an altered interaction between the MA domain of Gag and the gp41 cytoplasmic tail leads to dissociation of gp120 from gp41 during HIV-1 particle assembly, thus resulting in impaired fusion and infectivity."
9382,0.01,2.0000,"Several reports have recently shown that drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is often isolated from treatment-naïve patients. We phenotypically analyzed HIV-1 strains isolated from 44 treatment-naïve individuals and found two strains highly resistant (69- and >310-fold) against nevirapine (NVP). Direct sequencing showed these two isolates had a novel mutation, K238S, in reverse transcriptase (RT), but did not have any reported NVP resistance-associated mutation. A 48-h culture in the presence of NVP, however, selected HIV-1 carrying NVP resistance-associated mutations, V106A, V108I, or both, suggesting that minor viral populations of these two isolates had harbored these mutations. Replication kinetic studies of recombinant HIV-1 clones suggested that K238S conferred a significant resistance against NVP, especially when accompanied with V106A (530-fold) or V108I (56-fold). Our study identified a novel NVP resistance-associated mutation, K238S, which could be persistently detected by genotypic assay longer than V106A and V108I during off-treatment period."
4642,0.01,2.0000,"A nationwide hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination program for neonates was launched in Iran in 1993. Despite the success of this program, concern about its long-term success still remains, because breakthrough infections due to emergence of surface mutants have been reported in immunized children. We aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of HBV and vaccine escape mutants among individuals born after the initiation of the nationwide vaccination program in Iran. This study included 1115 participants younger than 23 years old, with 223 in each age cohort. The presence of HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc was evaluated using an ELISA kit. HBV-DNA levels were measured in anti-HBc and/or HBsAg-positive subjects. PCR products were sequenced and mutations were identified. The overall HBsAg prevalence was 0.27 %. Anti-HBs and anti-HBc positive rates were 48 % and 0.18 %, respectively. Two individuals were positive for anti-HBc, one of whom was also positive for HBsAg, and the other was positive for anti-HBc only. HBV DNA was detected in three out of four anti-HBc-and /or HBsAg-positive subjects. An I195M mutation within the S gene was detected in two of the three HBV-DNA-positive cases. A very low prevalence of HBsAg and isolated anti-HBc were found in this study. The I195M mutation found in the surface gene could have been induced by immune pressure. Although the number of ''vaccine escape'' mutants found in this cohort was low, ongoing surveillance of breakthrough infections and escape mutants is still needed."
534,0.01,2.0000,"Mortality in HIV-infected patients has decreased dramatically since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We analyzed progression to death in a population of 3678 antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from the ATHENA national observational cohort from 24 weeks after the start of HAART. Mortality was compared with that in the general population in the Netherlands matched by age and gender. Only log-transformed CD4 cell count (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40 to 0.61 per unit increase) and plasma viral load (HR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.60, HIV RNA level <100,000 vs. > or = 100,000 copies/mL) measured at 24 weeks and infection via intravenous drug use (IDU) (HR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.26, non-IDU vs. IDU) were significantly associated with progression to death. For non-IDU patients with 600 x 10 CD4 cells/L and an HIV RNA level <100,000 copies/mL at 24 weeks, mortality was predicted to be 5.3 (95% CI: 3.5 to 8.4) and 10.4 (95% CI: 6.4 to 17.4) times higher than in the general population for 25-year-old men and women, respectively, and 1.15 (95% CI: 1.08 to 1.25) and 1.29 (95% CI: 1.16 to 1.50) times higher for 65-year-old men and women, respectively. Hence, mortality in HIV-infected patients with a good initial response to HAART is still higher than in the general population."
5703,0.01,2.0000,"With ongoing earlier enrollment on and rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cameroon, there are increasing risks of transmitted HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) at population levels. We, therefore, evaluated the threshold of HIVDR in a population initiating ART, to inform on the effectiveness of first-line regimens, considering HIV-1 diversity, plasma viral load (PVL), and CD4-based disease progression. A total of 53 adults [median (interquartile range, IQR) CD4: 162 cell/mm(3) (48-284); median (IQR) PVL: 5.34 log10 RNA (4.17-6.42) copies/ml] initiating ART in 2014 at the Yaoundé Central Hospital were enrolled for HIV-1 protease-reverse transcriptase sequencing. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were interpreted using the 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) list versus the Stanford HIVdb algorithm version 7.0. Level of DRMs was low (3.77%) versus moderate (7.55%), respectively, following the WHO list (T69D, K103N) versus Stanford HIVdb (T69D, A98G, K103N, K238T), respectively. Prevailing clade was CRF02_AG (71.70%). Based on Stanford HIVdb, a slightly higher proportion of patients with DRMs were found among ones infected with CRF02_AG than in those non-CRF02_AG infected (7.89% vs. 6.67%, p = 1.000), with lower PVL (7.69% <5.5 vs. 0% ≥5.5 log10 RNA copies/ml, p = .488) and with higher CD4 counts (9.52% CD4 ≥200 vs. 3.33% CD4 <200 cells/mm(3), p = .749). Thresholds of DRMs suggest that standard first-line regimens currently used in Cameroon may remain effective at population levels, despite scale-up of ART in the country, pending adherence, and closed virological monitoring. With an intent-to-diagnose approach, the discrepant levels of DRMs support using Stanford HIVdb to evaluate initial ART, while revising the WHO list for surveillance."
3155,0.01,2.0000,"Interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope and the relevant chemokine receptors is crucial for subsequent membrane fusion and viral entry. Although the V3 region of gp120 is known to determine the cell tropism as well as the coreceptor usage, the significance of the binding of the V3 region to the chemokine receptor has not been fully understood. To address this issue, we adopted the pseudotyped virus infection assay in which the V3 region of the T-cell line-tropic (T-tropic) NL4-3 envelope was replaced with a portion of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), the ligand of CXCR4. The V3 region of the NL4-3 envelope expression vector was replaced with three different stretches of SDF-1 cDNA. Expression of each chimeric envelope protein was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Luciferase reporter viruses were prepared by cotransfection of the pNL4-3.Luc.E(-)R(-) vector and each chimeric envelope expression vector, and the infection assay was then carried out. We showed that pseudotyped viruses with one of the chimeric envelopes, NL4-3/SDF1-51, could infect U87.CD4.CXCR4 but not U87.CD4 or U87.CXCR4 cells and that this infection was inhibited by the ligand of CXCR4, SDF-1beta, by anti-human SDF-1 antibody, or by an anti-CD4 antibody, Leu3a, in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, chimeric NL4-3/SDF1-51 gp120 significantly inhibited binding of labeled SDF-1 to CXCR4. It was suggested that replacement of the V3 region of the NL4-3 envelope with SDF-1 preserved the CD4-dependent infectivity of T-tropic HIV-1. These results indicate that binding between the V3 region and the relevant coreceptor is important for viral entry, whether its amino acid sequence is indigenous to the virus or not."
8801,0.01,2.0000,"The host genetic compound plays a vital role in determining clinical outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor family member-associated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activator (TANK) takes part in the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway and the interferon (IFN)-induction pathways that have relevance to HBV-related liver disease. In this report, we explored whether the intronic polymorphism rs3820998 of the TANK gene was associated with outcomes of HBV infection by binary logistic regression analysis. A total of 1305 unrelated Han Chinese patients recruited from Wuhan, including 180 acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACLF-HBV) patients, 331 HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, 308 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and 486 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsC) were genotyped using the TaqMan probe method. Logistic analysis revealed that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3820998 was significantly associated with susceptibility to ACLF-HBV (dominant model, OR 0.643, 95% CI 0.428,0.964, p=0.033; additive model, OR 0.640, 95% CI 0.414,0.990, p=0.045), and LC (recessive model, OR 0.398, 95% CI 0.164,0.966, p=0.042; additive model, OR 0.379, 95% CI 0.155,0.928, p=0.034). These results indicate that the G > T variant is a protective factor in the development of ACLF-HBV and LC, and that the SNP rs3820998 in the TANK gene may play a role in mediating susceptibility to ACLF-HBV and LC in a Chinese Han population."
5143,0.01,2.0000,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) nearby the IL28B gene have been associated with spontaneous hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance and response to interferon-based therapies in both monoinfected and HIV-coinfected patients. However, its impact on spontaneous clearance of HBV (the pathogenesis of which is also related to interferon) is less known. A case-control study was performed. Cases were 49 HIV(+) patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBsAg(+) for more than 6 months) who had been genotyped for the rs12979860 SNP (protective CC genotype). One control for each case was chosen among HIV patients with anti-HBs and anti-HBc. Controls were matched for gender and coinfection with HCV. Most patients were male (90%) and the median (IQR) age was 42.6 (39-46.7) years. Eighteen (36.7%) were also coinfected by HCV. Among HBsAg(+) patients, 19 (41.3%) were HBeAg(+) and 13 (26.5%) were also infected with hepatitis delta (HDV). No differences were found in the distribution of the CC genotype between patients with chronic hepatitis B and those who spontaneously cured hepatitis B: 59.2% vs. 44.9%; p=0.3. Thus, the interleukin-28B (IL-28B) genotype does not seem to have a role in the development of chronic hepatitis B among HIV-infected patients."

This study compared self-reported HAV and HBV vaccination levels, based on demographics, health characteristics, hepatitis knowledge, attitudes and risk behaviours among MSM using an online survey posted from February through June 2005. Each participant (n = 968) reported whether they were vaccinated, infected or susceptible for hepatitis A and/or for hepatitis B. Men whose health-care provider recommended vaccination were 12.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.11, 20.55) times more likely to be vaccinated against HAV and 17.93 (95% CI 10.82, 29.70) times more likely to be vaccinated against HBV than those at risk of infection, respectively.

68,0.01,2.0000,"The authors have successfully used combination ganciclovir and foscarnet chemotherapy to control viral replication following liver transplantation in a patient with severe recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The disease was characterized by extremely high viraemias, deteriorating liver function, and high levels of intra-hepatic hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Treatment resulted in a greater than 30-fold reduction in serum HBV DNA and HBsAg levels. Liver function tests returned to normal and the histological progression of the disease was arrested. Hepatic cytoplasmic HBsAg decreased substantially but there was little change in HBcAg, implicating HBsAg rather than HBcAg in the liver injury. Combination antiviral chemotherapy using agents such as ganciclovir and foscarnet may offer a new approach to the management of post-transplant recurrence of HBV."
2899,0.01,2.0000,"Malnutrition characterized by weight loss and often extreme wasting generally develops when patients progress from infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to AIDS. There is evidence that before the development of AIDS, HIV-infected patients without weight loss show early signs of malnutrition, defined as an increase in the ratio of extracellular mass (ECM) to body cell mass (BCM). As part of a dietary intervention study, body composition measurement were obtained at baseline and after 6 wk in 18 patients with HIV infection and CD4 counts between 140 and 740 cells/mm3. Only one patient had a prior weight loss (3.7 kg); patients gained 2 pounds after 3 wk of dietary supplementation of 500 kcal daily. Bioelectrical impedance was used to measured body compartments. The average ECM/BCM ratio (0.77 +/- 0.13) was within the normal range (0.83 +/- 0.16) indicating the absence of malnutrition by this criterion. Most measurements of BCM (kg) approximated normal values, while several for BCM (kg) exceeded normal. BCM (kg) correlated poorly with the ECM/BCM ratio (r2 = 0.08; P = 0.11) in contrast to ECM (kg), which was well correlated (r2 = 0.82; P = 0.00). In addition, there was a significant correlation of body mass index (BMI) with the ECM/BCM ratio (r2 = 0.38; P = 0.00) and with ECM (r2 = 0.244; P = 0.003) indicating that overweight patients may be more likely to be considered malnourished than normal weight patients using this ratio. Without use of bioelectrical impedance, these subtle changes might be missed. Once significant weight loss has occurred coupled with decreases in BCM (kg), the ECM/BCM ratio may be more reflective of malnutrition. These conjectures will require prospective evaluation, but for now it seems reasonable to include bioelectrical impedance as a potentially useful tool in the evaluation of malnutrition in this population."
2798,0.01,2.0000,"Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a widely used procedure for AIDS-related lymphomas, and it represents an opportunity to evaluate strategies curing HIV-1 infection. The association of autograft HIV-DNA load with peripheral blood HIV-1 reservoir before ASCT and its contribution in predicting HIV-1 reservoir size and stability during combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) after transplantation are unknown. Aiming to obtain information suggesting new functional cure strategies by ASCT, we retrospectively evaluated HIV-DNA load in autograft and in peripheral blood before and after transplantation in 13 cART-treated HIV-1 relapse/refractoring lymphoma patients. Among them seven discontinued cART after autograft infusion. HIV-DNA was evaluated by a sensitive quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After debulking chemotherapy/mobilization, the autograft HIV-1 reservoir was higher than and not associated with the peripheral HIV-1 reservoir at baseline [median 215 HIV-DNA copies/10(6) autograft mononuclear cells, range 13-706 vs. 82 HIV-DNA copies/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), range 13-479, p = 0.03]. After high dose chemotherapy and autograft infusion, HIV-DNA levels reached a plateau between month 6 and 12 of follow-up. No association was found between peripheral HIV-DNA levels at baseline and after infusion in both cART interrupting and not interrupting patients. Only in the last subgroup, a stable significant linear association between autograft and peripheral blood HIV-1 reservoir emerged from month 1 (R(2) = 0.84, p = 0.01) to month 12 follow-up (R(2) = 0.99, p = 0.0005). In summary, autograft HIV-1 reservoir size could be influenced by the mobilization phase and predicts posttransplant peripheral HIV-1 reservoir size in patients on continuous cART. These findings could promote new research on strategies reducing the HIV-1 reservoir by using the ASCT procedure."

We prospectively assessed 25(OH)D deficiency/insufficiency in a cohort of 352 HIV patients during 2009-2010. Predisposing factors were recorded and their relationship to low levels was assessed by logistic regression; a nutritional survey examined intake, nutritional status, and sunlight exposure in a subgroup of 92 patients. We studied the correlation of 25(OH)D with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) was 44.0% (95% CI, 38.8-49.4%) and insufficiency (<30 ng/ml) was 71.6% (95% CI, 66.9-76.3). Deficiency was 16.4% more prevalent in our sample than in non-HIV-infected Spaniards. Lower sunlight exposure was the only factor related to lower levels in the lifestyle and nutritional survey (p=0.045). In multiple logistic regression, higher body mass index (BMI), black race/ethnicity, lower seasonal sunlight exposure, men who have sex with men (MSM), and heterosexual transmission categories, efavirenz exposure and lack of HIV viral suppression were independently associated with deficiency/insufficiency. These variables predicted 79% of cases [AUC=0.872 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91)]. Patients receiving protease inhibitors (PIs) [OR 4.0 (95% CI, 1.3-12.3); p=0.014] or NNRTI [OR 3.6 (95% CI, 1.7-11.2); p=0.025] had higher odds of increased PTH levels; this was significant only in 25(OH)D-deficient patients (p=0.004). As in less insolated areas, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was high in HIV-infected patients in Spain; among treated patients, levels were higher with PIs than with efavirenz."
7239,0.01,2.0000,"We describe a 44-year-old male patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and pulmonary arterial hypertension who was treated with several protease inhibitors and with sildenafil. In order to guide treatment with sildenafil, the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of sildenafil were monitored at various time points. In comparison with healthy subjects, the maximal concentration in plasma (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), and elimination half-life of sildenafil were approximately doubled in the patient. After increasing the sildenafil dose to ensure therapeutic drug levels over 24 hours, the pulmonary arterial hypertension and physical performance of the patient improved significantly. We conclude that the elimination of sildenafil is impaired in patients treated with protease inhibitors, but to a lesser extent than predicted from single-dose studies reported in the literature. Patients treated concomitantly with protease inhibitors and sildenafil need close monitoring of plasma levels, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity of sildenafil in order to be treated optimally."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem that represents a significant co-morbidity event that has led to outbreaks of hepatitis B. There are inadequate data concerning occult HBV infection among Egyptian chronic hemodialysis patients. This study aimed to detect occult HBV infection among chronic hemodialysis patients in Alexandria, Egypt. A cross-sectional study was performed on 100 patients with end-stage renal disease that received maintenance hemodialysis and had tested negative for HBV surface antigen. Blood samples were collected before the initiation of hemodialysis. Sera were tested for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B core (HBc) antibodies using ELISA, and HBV DNA was detected by SYBR Green real-time PCR using specific primers for the s and c genes and by nested PCR using pol gene-specific primers. The serum activity of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST) were also measured. Anti-HCV and anti-HBc antibodies were detected in 34% and 48% of patients, respectively, and 70.6% of anti-HCV positive patients were also positive for anti-HBc antibodies. This association was statistically significant (p=0.001). HBV DNA was detected in 32% of the hemodialysis patients. A significant association was determined between the presence of HBV DNA and anti-HCV positivity (p=0.021). Aminotransferases were elevated in 21% of the studied patients, more often in patients with positive anti-HCV profiles than in patients negative for anti-HCV (p<0.05). In conclusion, the serological markers of HBV infection should be verified with molecular tests to investigate possible occult infections, especially among anti-HBc-positive hemodialysis patients, to improve our understanding of their clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological characteristics.

1843,0.01,2.0000,"Effectiveness of antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention will require high adherence. Using qualitative data, this paper identifies potential lay social resources for support of PrEP adherence by HIV serodiscordant couples in Uganda, laying the groundwork for incorporation of these resources into adherence support initiatives as part of implementation. The qualitative analysis characterizes support for PrEP adherence provided by HIV-infected spouses, children, extended family members, and the larger community. Results suggest social resources for support of PrEP adherence in Africa are plentiful outside formal health care settings and health systems and that couples will readily use them. The same shortage of health professionals that impeded scale-up of antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS in Africa promises to challenge delivery of PrEP. Building on the treatment scale-up experience, implementers can address this challenge by examining the value of lay social resources for adherence support in developing strategies for delivery of PrEP."
2457,0.01,2.0000,"Most children in Africa receive their vaccine against tuberculosis at birth. Those infants born to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-positive mothers are at high risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection through breastfeeding in the first weeks of their lives. Thus, the development of a vaccine which would protect newborns against both of these major global killers is a logical yet highly scientifically, ethically, and practically challenging aim. Here, a recombinant lysine auxotroph of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), a BCG strain that is safer than those currently used and expresses an African HIV-1 clade-derived immunogen, was generated and shown to be stable and to induce durable, high-quality HIV-1-specific CD4(+)- and CD8(+)-T-cell responses. Furthermore, when the recombinant BCG vaccine was used in a priming-boosting regimen with heterologous components, the HIV-1-specific responses provided protection against surrogate virus challenge, and the recombinant BCG vaccine alone protected against aerosol challenge with M. tuberculosis. Thus, inserting an HIV-1-derived immunogen into the scheduled BCG vaccine delivered at or soon after birth may prime HIV-1-specific responses, which can be boosted by natural exposure to HIV-1 in the breast milk and/or by a heterologous vaccine such as recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara delivering the same immunogen, and decrease mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 during breastfeeding."
8959,0.01,2.0000,"Transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne viruses in hospitals is discussed, and the infection control system and worker protection and education plan at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) are described. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic has led to increased concern about occupationally acquired infections in health-care workers. As the number of HIV-infected persons increases, so does the risk of infection. Occupationally acquired HIV infection of health-care workers occurs principally in nurses, phlebotomists, and laboratory technicians through accidental subcutaneous injection of contaminated blood; splashing of blood onto open skin lesions, the eyes, and mucous membranes represents another route of exposure. The risk of infection from a single needle-stick exposure to HIV-infected blood is about 0.4%. Other blood-borne viruses to which employees are vulnerable include hepatitis B virus and human T-cell lymphotropic viruses, which may cause leukemia and lymphoma. SFGH has a comprehensive infection control system. Specimen containers are enclosed in transparent secondary containers, the worker is encouraged to wear protective clothing when necessary, and specific needle-stick precautions are promoted. There is also a health-care worker protection and education plan. The employee health services department provides immunizations, keeps records on accidental exposures, and operates a hot line. The education committee disseminates educational materials and arranges lectures. Infection control and education provide simple but effective measures for protecting hospital employees against HIV and other occupationally acquired infections."
3241,0.01,2.0000,"The resuscitation of a trauma patient is a very hectic and seemingly chaotic situation. The nature of the situation increases the likelihood that a health care worker will receive an accidental needle stick while caring for the patient. There is also a common belief that there is a higher prevalence of communicable bloodborne diseases in the trauma population, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes the greatest amount of fear. This belief of higher prevalence communicable diseases in the trauma population is supported by the literature. We sent blood from our Code One (life-threatening) trauma population for analysis for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies. We found that 0.52% of our trauma population had HIV. We also found that 1.5 per cent had hepatitis B surface antigen, and 13.8 per cent had hepatitis C antibodies. Our prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B is similar to that found in other studies of the trauma populations and higher than the general population. Our hepatitis C prevalence is surprising, considering the very low reported prevalence in the general population. Hepatitis C may be a more significant threat to the health of medical personnel than previously believed."
9519,0.01,2.0000,"Aging with HIV poses unique and complex challenges, including avoidance of neurocognitive disorder. Our objective here is to identify the prevalence and predictors of successful cognitive aging (SCA) in a sample of older adults with HIV. One hundred three HIV-infected individuals aged 50 and older were recruited from the Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic in Italy. Participants were treated with combination antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year and had suppressed plasma HIV viral load. SCA was defined as the absence of neurocognitive impairment (as defined by deficits in tasks of episodic learning, information processing speed, executive function, and motor skills) depression, and functional impairment (instrumental activities of daily living). In cross-sectional analyses, odds of SCA were assessed in relation to HIV-related clinical data, HIV-Associated Non-AIDS (HANA) conditions, multimorbidity (≥2HANA conditions), and frailty. A frailty index was calculated as the number of deficits present out of 37 health variables. SCA was identified in 38.8% of participants. Despite no differences in average chronologic age between groups, SCA participants had significantly fewer HANA conditions, a lower frailty index, and were less likely to have hypertension. In addition, hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, p = .04), multimorbidity (OR = 0.35, p = .05), and frailty (OR = 0.64, p = .04) were significantly associated with odds of SCA. Frailty is associated with the likelihood of SCA in people living with HIV. This defines an opportunity to apply knowledge from geriatric population research to people aging with HIV to better appreciate the complexity of their health status."
84,0.01,2.0000,"Abnormalities of the skin are frequent and troubling problems for patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A number of studies have assessed the frequency and severity of diseases of the skin and mucous membranes reported from other centers, but relationships between dermatologic signs and symptoms and either the lymphocyte count or the helper T-lymphocyte count have been infrequently noted. In a prospective study of 6 months' duration, one of us (A.F.) examined and questioned 61 HIV-seropositive patients at our infectious disease clinic. We found a significant association between the number and severity of cutaneous abnormalities and the helper T-cell (CD4) count. A trend toward significance was also shown between advanced HIV-disease status or decreased CD4 counts and pruritus. Our findings suggest that both the peripheral blood lymphocyte count and the helper T-cell count are predictive of the frequency, severity, and symptoms of skin diseases."
4282,0.01,2.0000,"Primary HIV-1 infection is a relevant period for its virological and epidemiological consequences. Most patients present a symptomatic disease that can be potentially serious, but neurological involvement during primary HIV-1 infection has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of primary HIV-1 infection patients presenting neurological symptoms and to compare them with primary HIV-1 infection patients without neurological involvement. Retrospective case-control study (1:3) comparing primary HIV-1 infection patients with and without neurological involvement enrolled in the Acute/Recent Hospital Clinic PHI Cohort between 1997 and 2016. Matching criteria included age (±10 years), gender, year of diagnosis (±4 years), and Fiebig stage. The conditional logit model was used for comparisons. Fourteen out of 463 patients (3.02%) enrolled in the Acute/Recent Hospital Clinic PHI Cohort between 1997 and 2016 presented neurological symptoms. 28.5% of cases presented as meningitis and 71.5% as meningoencephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid showed non-specific findings, including pleocytosis with lymphocyte predominance and increased protein levels. All cases required hospitalisation, whereas only 19% of the controls did. No other pathogen was identified in any case, but five patients initiated empirically antimicrobial treatment for other aetiologies until diagnosis was confirmed. CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly lower (p = 0.039) and plasmatic viral load significantly higher in the case group, compared to controls (p = 0.028). Risk factors, HIV-1 tropism, subtype distribution, and prescribed ART regimens were comparable between cases and controls. After 6 months on ART, 92% of cases had undetectable viral load, similar to controls, and CD4/CD8 ratio became also comparable between groups. All cases recovered rapidly with ART and were discharged without sequels. Neurological involvement during primary HIV-1 infection is unusual but serious, always requiring hospitalisation. Diagnosis is difficult because of the wide range of symptoms and similarities with other viral aetiologies. Neurological manifestations during primary HIV-1 infection are associated with a lower CD4/CD8 ratio and with a higher viral load than controls. Immediate ART initiation and rapid viral load decrease are required, allowing complete clinical recovery."
1501,0.01,2.0000,"Administering and monitoring therapy is crucial to the battle against HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Electronic medical records (EMRs) can aid in documenting care, monitoring drug adherence and response to therapy, and providing data for quality improvement and research. Faculty at Moi University in Kenya and Indiana and University in the USA opened adult and pediatric HIV clinics in a national referral hospital, a district hospital, and six rural health centers in western Kenya using a newly developed EMR to support comprehensive outpatient HIV/AIDS care. Demographic, clinical, and HIV risk data, diagnostic test results, and treatment information are recorded on paper encounter forms and hand-entered into a central database that prints summary flowsheets and reminders for appropriate testing and treatment. There are separate modules for monitoring the Antenatal Clinic and Pharmacy. The EMR was designed with input from clinicians who understand the local community and constraints of providing care in resource poor settings. To date, the EMR contains more than 30,000 visit records for more than 4000 patients, almost half taking antiretroviral drugs. We describe the development and structure of this EMR and plans for future development that include wireless connections, tablet computers, and migration to a Web-based platform."
3662,0.01,2.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can suppress HIV-1 replication and normalize the chronic immune activation associated with infection, but restoration of naïve CD4+ T cell populations is slow and usually incomplete for reasons that have yet to be determined. We tested the hypothesis that damage to the lymphoid tissue (LT) fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network contributes to naïve T cell loss in HIV-1 infection by restricting access to critical factors required for T cell survival. We show that collagen deposition and progressive loss of the FRC network in LTs prior to treatment restrict both access to and a major source of the survival factor interleukin-7 (IL-7). As a consequence, apoptosis within naïve T cell populations increases significantly, resulting in progressive depletion of both naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. We further show that the extent of loss of the FRC network and collagen deposition predict the extent of restoration of the naïve T cell population after 6 month of HAART, and that restoration of FRC networks correlates with the stage of disease at which the therapy is initiated. Because restoration of the FRC network and reconstitution of naïve T cell populations are only optimal when therapy is initiated in the early/acute stage of infection, our findings strongly suggest that HAART should be initiated as soon as possible. Moreover, our findings also point to the potential use of adjunctive anti-fibrotic therapies to avert or moderate the pathological consequences of LT fibrosis, thereby improving immune reconstitution."
4552,0.01,2.0000,"Patients with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection have more severe hepatitis-related disease than do patients with HCV infection alone. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with protease inhibitor appears to restore pathogen-specific immune responses, especially in patients with persistent undetectable HIV viral load. To evaluate the potent impact of immune restoration induced by HAART on the course of HCV-related disease, HCV viremia and levels of transaminases were compared between two groups of patients: 10 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with persistently undetectable HIV viremia (group A) and 12 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with persistent detectable HIV viremia. No difference was detected in HCV viral load in either group. An increase in transaminases was found only in patients with persistent undetectable HIV viral load, which was correlated with the increase in CD8+ T cells. This may suggest that the restoration of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity could lead to an enhancement of hepatitis C-related disease in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients receiving HAART."
9179,0.01,2.0000,"We analyzed the kinetics of CD4 cells, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load, and autoantibodies in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients with Graves' disease (GD) after immune restoration on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART; retrospective study). Five patients (median age, 41 yr) were diagnosed with GD after 20 (range, 14-22) months on HAART on the basis of clinical and biological hyperthyroidism, diffuse hyperfixation of thyroid scan, and the presence of anti-TSH receptor (anti-TSHR) antibodies (Ab). GD was diagnosed several months after the plasma HIV ribonucleic acid load became undetectable, when the CD4+ cell count had risen from 14 (range, 0-62) to 340 (range, 163-460) x 10(6) cells/L. Antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-TSHRAb appeared 14 (range, 9-18) and 14 (range, 11-20) months after starting HAART and 12 (range, 6-15) and 11 (range, 9-17) months after the increase in CD4+ cells. In 3 patients, TPOAb preceded TSHRAb by 3-10 months. No other autoantibodies were detected. Thyroid antibodies were absent in a group of 55 HIV-1-positive patients with comparable response to HAART and no symptoms of hyperthyroidism (cross-sectional study). Thyroid-specific autoimmunity can occur upon immune restoration with HAART. Our observations suggest a relationship between thymus-dependent immune reconstitution after immunosuppression and autoimmunity and may provide insight into the pathophysiology of GD."
7444,0.01,2.0000,"The objective of this study was to assess the performance of 4 biologic tests designed to detect recent HIV-1 infections in estimating incidence in West Africa (BED, Vironostika, Avidity, and IDE-V3). These tests were assessed on a panel of 135 samples from 79 HIV-1-positive regular blood donors from Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, whose date of seroconversion was known (Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA et les Hépatites Virales 1220 cohort). The 135 samples included 26 from recently infected patients (< or =180 days), 94 from AIDS-free subjects with long-standing infection (>180 days), and 15 from patients with clinical AIDS. The performance of each assay in estimating HIV incidence was assessed through simulations. The modified commercial assays gave the best results for sensitivity (100% for both), and the IDE-V3 technique gave the best result for specificity (96.3%). In a context like Abidjan, with a 10% HIV-1 prevalence associated with a 1% annual incidence, the estimated test-specific annual incidence rates would be 1.2% (IDE-V3), 5.5% (Vironostika), 6.2% (BED), and 11.2% (Avidity). Most of the specimens falsely classified as incident cases were from patients infected for >180 days but <1 year. The authors conclude that none of the 4 methods could currently be used to estimate HIV-1 incidence routinely in Côte d'Ivoire but that further adaptations might enhance their accuracy."
7237,0.01,2.0000,"The activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) expression in latently infected cells by exogenous agents is believed to be important in the progression of AIDS. Most factors that are known to activate HIV-1 gene expression increase the binding of NF-kappa B or NF-kappa B-like transcription factors to the HIV-1 core enhancer region. In this report, we demonstrate that retinoic acid (RA) treatment of promonocytic U937 cells stimulates expression from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) long terminal repeat (LTR). Furthermore, RA and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) synergistically stimulated both SIVmac and HIV-1 LTRs to levels of expression comparable to that achieved by the viral transactivator Tat. The cis-acting elements required for a response to RA and PMA cotreatment are located between nucleotides -50 and +1 of SIVmac and between nucleotides -83 and +80 of HIV-1. Thus, the synergistic stimulation induced by RA and PMA is NF-kappa B independent. Analysis of deletion mutants of the SIVmac LTR demonstrates that RA and PMA stimulation cooperates with NF-kappa B and Sp1. An SIVmac LTR-reporter gene construct [pLTR(-50/+466)CAT] lacking NF-kappa B and Sp1 binding sites was not activated by Tat in untreated cells but was activated in cells that were cotreated with RA and PMA. Furthermore, gel retardation assays demonstrated that RA treatment causes a change in the pattern of a cellular factor(s) which binds to the -50 through +1 region of the SIVmac LTR. These data suggest that RA induces a PMA-activatable cellular factor that cooperates with NF-kappa B, Sp1, or Tat to stimulate LTR-directed transcription."

5566,0.01,2.0000,"Early studies of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use in clinical practice suggested suboptimal rates of viral suppression. HAART regimens and expertise in the use of HAART have since evolved, and we sought to determine how virologic response to HAART has changed in clinical practice. We compared all patients who started a first HAART regimen from 1996 through 2002 in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected patients in care in Baltimore. There were significant improvements in suppressing HIV RNA to < 400 copies/mL, ranging from 43.8% (1996) to 72.4% (2001-2002) by 6 months and from 60.1% (1996) to 79.9% (2001-2002) by 12 months (both P < 0.01 for trend). There were also significant improvements in CD4 cell response. Over time, there was a significant increase in the use of a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen compared with a single PI as well as an increase in the number of patients who were antiretroviral (ARV) naive. There was also a significant temporal trend from 1996 through 2002 in achieving a suppressed HIV RNA level, adjusting for being ARV naive, specific HAART regimen, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, and demographic factors. This suggests that improved virologic response may also be attributable to other factors such as a greater focus on medication adherence, improved ARV tolerability, and ease of dosing."
1255,0.01,2.0000,"Fluconazole inhibits cytochrome P-450-mediated enzymatic metabolism of several drugs. Since hepatic metabolism is partially responsible for 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (didanosine or ddI) elimination, fluconazole therapy may lead to increased ddI concentrations in serum and subsequent concentration-dependent adverse effects. The purpose of this study was to determine if ddI pharmacokinetics are influenced by a 7-day course of oral fluconazole. Twelve adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had received a constant dosage of ddI for at least 2 weeks were investigated. On study day 1, multiple serum samples for determination of ddI concentrations were obtained over 12 h. Then subjects received a 7-day course of oral fluconazole (200 mg every 12 h for two doses and then 200 mg once daily for 6 days) while ddI therapy continued. Following the last dose of fluconazole, serum samples for determination of ddI concentrations were again obtained over 12 h. ddI concentrations in serum were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. In contrast to previously published data, there was marked between-subject variability in ddI areas under the concentration-time curve, even when the dose was normalized for weight. No significant differences were found between mean ddI areas under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h on study day 1 (1,528 +/- 902 ngx.hr/ml) and following fluconazole treatment (1,486 +/- 649 ngx.hr/ml) . There were no significant differences in other pharmacokinetic parameters, such as ddI peak concentrations in serum (971 +/- 509 and 942 +/- 442 ng/ml) or half-lives (80 +/- 32 and 85 +/- 21 min.) before and after fluconazole treatment, respectively. We conclude that a 7-day course of oral fluconazole does not significantly alter ddI pharmacokinetics in adults that are infected with human immunodeficiency virus."
2217,0.01,2.0000,"A variety of HIV-induced lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) have been described, including HIV encephalitis, HIV leukoencephalopathy, axonal damage, and diffuse poliodystrophy with neuronal loss of variable severity resulting, at least partly, from an apoptotic process. However, no correlation could be established between these changes and HIV dementia (HIVD). From our study of HIV infected patients, it appeared that neuronal apoptosis is probably not related to a single cause. Microglial and glial activation, directly or indirectly related to HIV infection, plays a major role in neuronal apoptosis possibly through the mediation of oxidative stress. In our patients with full-blown AIDS, this mechanism predominated in the basal ganglia and correlated well with HIVD. Axonal damage, either secondary to microglial activation, or to systemic factors also contributes to neuronal apoptosis. Although massive neuronal loss may be responsible for HIVD in occasional cases, we conclude that neuronal apoptosis is a late event and does not represent the main pathological substrate of HIVD. The dementia more likely reflects a specific neuronal dysfunction resulting from the combined effects of several mechanisms, some of which may be reversible. Introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy dramatically improved patient survival, however, its impact on the incidence and course of HIVD remains debatable. In our series, the incidence of HIVE has dramatically decreased since the introduction of multitherapies, but a number of cases remain whose cognitive disorders persist, despite HAART. The poor CNS penetration of many antiretroviral agents is a possible explanation, but irreversible ""burnt out"" HIV-induced CNS changes may also be responsible."

The study, from April 2003 to May 2005, with follow-up through 24 mo, was conducted at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Second Xiangya Hospital, Central-South University in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. Twenty-seven HIV1-infected patients received didanosine, stavudine, and nevirapine. Information from case notes regarding age, sex, side effects, viral load, naive and memory T cells, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell count at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo was collected and analyzed. Virologic suppression, defined as an HIV RNA concentration of less than 50 copies/mL at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24, was considered the main outcome measure. Of 27 patients, 17 were men with a mean age 33.5 yr. The mean baseline viral load was 5.15 log copies/mL and the mean CD4(+) cell count was 185 cells/dL. Of 27 patients, 3 patients discontinued study medication; treatment was changed, because of side effects, from didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and nevirapine (NVP) to zidovudine, lamivudine, and NVP for 24 patients who had completed 24 mo of treatment with ddI, d4T, and NVP; and viral load suppression was attained in 17 patients (70.8%) at 12 mo, in 14 patients (58.3%) at 18 mo, and in 13 patients (56.6%) at 24 mo. The CD4 T cell count increased by 114 cells/microL (mean, 299 cells/microL) after 12 mo of treatment and by 132 cells/microL (mean, 317 cells/microL) after 24 mo of treatment. Naive T cells and memory cells also increased in number, but at a slower rate. Activated (CD38(+)) CD8(+) T cells were elevated at baseline (67.7%) and declined by month 24 (49.7%), but did not reach normal levels. We conclude that a regimen of NVP with ddI and d4T provided durable suppression of plasma viral load in HIV-infected patients, with significant improvement in the CD4 cell count, and can be well tolerated by patients with HIV-1 infection."
2151,0.01,2.0000,"Five regions of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) have been shown to be important in the transcriptional regulation of HIV in HeLa cells. These include the negative regulatory, enhancer, SP1, TATA, and TAR regions. Previous studies in which purified SP1 was used showed that the three SP1-binding sites in the HIV LTR were important in the in vitro transcription of this promoter. However, no studies to ascertain the role of each of these SP1-binding sites in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation in vivo have been reported. To determine the role of SP1 sites in transcriptional regulation of the HIV LTR in vivo, these sites were subjected to oligonucleotide mutagenesis both individually and in groups. The constructs were tested by DNase I footprinting with both oligonucleotide affinity column-purified SP1 and partially purified HeLa extract and by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in both the presence and absence of the tat gene. Mutagenesis of each SP1-binding site resulted in minimal changes in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation. Mutations involving alterations of SP1 sites I and II, I and III, or II and III also resulted in minimal decreases in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation. However, mutagenesis of all three SP1-binding sites resulted in a marked decrease in tat induction. The latter mutation also greatly decreased DNase I protection over the enhancer, TATA, and TAR regions when partially purified HeLa nuclear extract was used. Mutagenesis of the HIV LTR SP1 sites which converted them to consensus high-affinity SP1-binding sites with the sequence GGGGCGGGGC resulted in increased tat-induced gene expression compared with the wild-type HIV LTR template. These results suggest that SP1, through its interaction with other DNA-binding proteins, is critical for in vivo transcriptional regulation of HIV."
8919,0.01,2.0000,"A subset of HIV-1-infected patients undergoing antiretroviral treatment develops a lipodystrophy syndrome. It is characterized by loss of peripheral subcutaneous adipose tissue (face, limbs, buttocks), visceral fat accumulation, and, in some cases, lipomatosis, especially in the dorsocervical area. In addition, these patients show metabolic alterations reminiscent of the metabolic syndrome, particularly dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. These alterations lead to enhanced cardiovascular risk in patients and favor the development of diabetes. Although a complex combination of HIV-1 infection and drug treatment-related events triggers the syndrome, lipotoxicity appears to contribute to the development of the syndrome. Active lipolysis in subcutaneous fat, combined with impaired fat storage capacity in the subcutaneous depot, drive ectopic deposition of lipids, either in the visceral depot or in nonadipose sites. Both hepatic steatosis and increased lipid content in skeletal muscle take place and surely contribute to systemic metabolic alterations, especially insulin resistance. Pancreatic function may also be affected by the exposure to high levels of fatty acids; together with direct effects of antiretroviral drugs, this may contribute to impaired insulin release and a prodiabetic state in the patients. Addressing lipotoxicity as a pathogenic actor in the lipodystrophy syndrome should be considered in strategies for treating and/or preventing the morphological alterations and systemic metabolic disturbances associated with lipodystrophy."
3183,0.01,2.0000,"In 2004, KwaZulu-Natal initiated one of the world's largest HIV/AIDS treatment programs. Studies in South Africa have shown that patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) develop rapidly and transmit drug resistant mutations. Since resistance testing is not widely available in Kwazulu-Natal, the Department of Health conducted the first HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) threshold survey in 2005, which did not identify any mutations associated with HIVDR. The objective of this study was to conduct a follow-up threshold survey to update the information on HIVDR. This study was conducted in 2009 in five antenatal care sites in Kwazulu-Natal using the HIVDR threshold survey method developed by WHO. Two hundred and thirteen newly-diagnosed HIV positive, drug-naïve primigravidae, less than 22 years of age were included in the survey. Of the 82 HIV positive specimens, 17 had insufficient volume for genotyping and, of the remaining 65, 47 were genotyped sequentially. Drug resistance was identified by sequencing the HIV-1 pol gene, using the ViroSeq® HIV-1 genotyping system v2.0. Of the 47 samples that were genotyped, only one presented with a K103N mutation, which equates to a prevalence of transmitted HIVDR of <5%. The low prevalence of transmitted HIVDR is in keeping with statistical models of the early stages of ART rollout. As ART coverage is increasing continuously, there is a need to ensure that vigilance of HIVDR continues so that the emergence and spread of HIVDR is minimized."

9326,0.01,2.0000,"The majority of vertical infections with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) occur at or near delivery, strongly suggesting a mucosal route of transmission. The frequency and level of intrapartum mucosal exposure to HIV-1 of 22 infants born to infected mothers was investigated. Maternal plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count were measured at delivery. Infant oropharyngeal aspirates obtained at birth were examined for HIV-1 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and qualitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. Nine infants (41%) had detectable levels of HIV-1 RNA, 3 of which were quantifiable (mean, 3000 copies/mL). This mucosal exposure to HIV-1 during delivery did not lead to infection of any infant. Cesarian delivery did not reduce mucosal exposure to HIV-1. Mucosal exposure did not correlate with maternal CD4 cell count but did correlate with maternal plasma virus load and was reduced by antiretroviral therapy."

Using a human skin explant model, we found that the 50% infectious dose (ID50) of proviral SIV or HIV-1 plasmid may be as low as 1 microg when delivered to skin by gold particle bombardment using a gene gun. An infectious proviral clone of SIV mac239 with a 105 bp deletion in the 3' nef/LTR overlap region was engineered (SIVsbbc delta3), analogous to the initial common nef/LTR deletion in HIV-1 strains isolated from an Australian cohort of long-term slow-progressors. Two further macaques were also readily infected with SIVsbbc delta3 after i.m. injection of 300 microg of highly purified plasmid DNA. Unexpectedly, in one macaque inoculated with SIVsbbc delta3 DNA, SIV strains isolated three to six weeks after infection had completely repaired the nef/LTR deletion with wild-type sequence, and eventually progressed to AIDS. The mechanism used to rebuild this deletion with wild-type sequence, presumably derived from an intact 5' LTR, is unclear, but possibilities include RNA read-through errors from the plasmid DNA and recombination with residual plasmid DNA at the inoculation site."

Malnutrition represents another cause of acquired immunodeficiency and premature death. This evaluation program estimated the impact of family nutritional support during the first year of antiretroviral treatment in West Africa's sub-Sahara region. Family nutritional support was proposed to patients with CD-4 cell count <200 /mm3 and/or developing a WHO stage III/IV or with body mass index <18.5 kg/m2 and receiving antiretroviral treatment. Follow-up of 62 patients receiving support was compared to 118 patients who had only received antiretroviral treatment the year before. Average body mass index, CD-4 cell count were 20.7 and 20.5, 217 and 191/mm3 respectively in supported and control groups (NS). Twenty-two (36%) and 56 (48%) were WHO stage III/IV (NS) respectively in supported and control groups. One patient who received support and twelve controls died (Mortality Ratio=0.19; p<0.05). Increase in CD-4 cell count was around 1.7 times higher (+ 114 vs. + 68 CD-4 cells/mm3 respectively in supported and control groups; p<0.05) and observance was improved in supported group (p<0.005). The evolutions of WHO stage and body mass index were not different but the study period was short. Family nutritional support for persons living with HIV initiating antiretroviral treatment in a developing country showed a positive impact after six months. This family intervention could be integrated into AIDS interventions as an effective and comprehensive community-based primary care."
6234,0.01,2.0000,"Despite the use of antiretroviral medications during the antenatal/perinatal period, 280 to 370 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected infants are born each year in the United States. Women who might transmit the virus to their infants are (1) those not offered antenatal testing due to perceived low risk; (2) those who are noncompliant with their antiretroviral regimen; (3) those with prophylaxis failures despite good compliance; and (4) those who present late to delivery without prenatal care. The Centers for Disease Control and prevention sponsored MIRIAD (mother-infant rapid intervention at delivery) to study rapid testing of women who present late in pregnancy and/or to labor and delivery with unknown HIV status. MIRIAD was implemented in 18 hospitals in 6 American cities. In Atlanta, GA, the 2 participating hospitals had institutional differences that created different models of implementation. Hospital 1 is large and publicly funded, practicing team nursing and utilizing laboratory-based testing. Hospital 2 is a medium-sized nonprofit, whose primary nursing model allowed for specially trained staff to do point-of-care (POC) testing. Regardless of hospital type, nursing care paradigms, or testing model, facilities interested in successfully implementing a similar protocol must formulate policies for testing, notification, and treatment as well as consider dedicating a staff member to the program."
8997,0.01,2.0000,"Mutation rates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomes have been estimated using purified reverse transcriptase or single-round infection system. Since small sequences were used as templates, the overall mutation rates could only be extrapolated and the biological significance of mutations is unknown. For direct estimation of HIV-1 mutation rates and understanding of the potential biological influences of mutations, we obtained 19 complete or nearly full-length proviral genomes from single-round-infected adherent cells of lymphocytes by using a lambda phage library method and a long-range PCR technique. Analysis of 160,000 bp of sequences showed that the overall mutation rate of HIV-1 genomes was 5.4 x 10(-5) per base per replication cycle. On average, 1.1 mutations (range, 0 to 3) were generated in each viral genome during one infection cycle. Inspection of the mutations in the HIV-1 genome revealed that all site mutations within protein-coding regions were nonsynonymous mutations. Among all mutations, half were deleterious (premature stop codon and deletions) and would result in defective genomes. By applying the same system to an HIV-1 genome with a G262A mutation in the thumb region of the reverse transcriptase, a significant increase was observed in deletion and insertion mutation rates but no increase in the overall mutation rate in viral genomes was found."
2120,0.01,2.0000,"Mutations in the precore region of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been associated with failure of expression of HBV e-antigen (HBeAg), however, the prevalence of these and other mutations in HBV carriers without overt chronic liver disease remains uncertain. Homosexual or bisexual males (n = 65) with chronic HBV infection attending The Middlesex Hospital, London were studied, of whom two had clinical evidence of chronic liver disease. HBV DNA was amplified from 62 of 65 serum samples using nested and double nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Direct sequencing of the PCR products was employed to investigate sequence variation. HBV-DNA from all available HBeAg-negative (n = 9) and selected HBeAg-positive (n = 33) sera were sequenced in the entire precore gene, the 3' terminal portion of the X gene (aa128-154), and the 5' terminus of the core gene (aa18-73). Sequences were highly conserved in all regions studied. Samples from two anti-HBe-seropositive patients contained mutations in the precore region. In one, a single mutation in the first amino acid resulted in a change to leucine, which would prevent translation of this region and therefore HBeAg expression. Wild type sequences were also detected in this sample. In the other sample from a patient with overt chronic liver disease, a mutation of precore amino acid 28 changed a tryptophan residue to a stop codon which would also prevent HBeAg expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2715,0.01,2.0000,"Ten subjects received 600 to 1,200 mg of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor ritonavir per day. Following 2 weeks of therapy, plasma HIV RNA levels decreased by a mean of 1. 57 (range, 0.89 to 1.96) log units. With continued therapy, HIV RNA levels began to rise in eight subjects. The initial rise in plasma RNA levels was temporally associated with the development and quantitative increase in the V82 resistance mutation. Doubling times of the V82A mutant virus were estimated to be 2.4 to 4.8 days. An L63P/A mutation was commonly present at baseline even in subjects with a durable virologic response. The concomitant acquisition of an L63P/A mutation with the V82A/F mutation at the time when plasma RNA levels rebounded suggests a role for the L63P/A mutation in improving the fitness of the V82A/F mutation. Subsequent additional genotypic changes at codons 54 and 84 were often associated with further increases in plasma RNA levels. Ongoing viral replication in the presence of drugs resulted in the appearance of additional genotypic changes, including the L90M saquinavir resistance mutation, and decreased phenotypic susceptibility. The relative fitness of the protease V82A ritonavir resistance mutation and reverse transcriptase T215Y/F zidovudine resistance mutation following drug withdrawal were estimated to be 96 to 98% that of the wild type. Durability of the virologic response was associated with plasma RNA levels at the nadir. A virologic response beyond 60 days was not observed unless plasma HIV RNA levels were suppressed below 2,000 copies/ml, consistent with estimates from V82A doubling times for selection of a single resistance mutation to dominate the replicating population."

6919,0.01,2.0000,"This consensus document has been prepared by a panel consisting of members of the AIDS Study Group (Gesida) and the Spanish Secretariat for the National Plan on AIDS (SPNS) after reviewing the efficacy and safety results of clinical trials, cohort and pharmacokinetic studies published in medical journals, or presented in medical scientific meetings. Gesida has prepared an objective and structured method to prioritise combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) in naïve patients. Recommendations strength (A, B, C) and the evidence which supports them (I, II, III) are based on a modification of the Infectious Diseases Society of America criteria. The current antiretroviral treatment (ART) of choice for chronic HIV infection is the combination of three drugs. ART is recommended in patients with symptomatic HIV infection, in pregnancy, in serodiscordant couples with high transmission risk, hepatitis B fulfilling treatment criteria, and HIV nephropathy. Guidelines on ART treatment in patients with concurrent diagnosis of HIV infection and an opportunistic type C infection are included. In asymptomatic patients ART is recommended on the basis of CD4 lymphocyte counts, plasma viral load and patient co-morbidities, as follows: 1) therapy should be started in patients with CD4 counts <350 cells/μL; 2) when CD4 counts are between 350 and 500 cells/μL, therapy will be recommended and only delayed if patient is reluctant to take it, the CD4 are stabilised, and the plasma viral load is low; 3) therapy could be deferred when CD4 counts are above 500 cells/μL, but should be considered in cases of cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C, high cardiovascular risk, plasma viral load >10(5) copies/mL, proportion of CD4 cells <14%, and in people aged >55 years. ART should include 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors nucleoside analogues and a third drug (non-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor or integrase inhibitor). The panel has consensually selected and given priority to using the Gesida score for some drug combinations, some of them co-formulated. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable viral load. Adherence to therapy plays an essential role in maintaining antiviral response. Therapeutic options are limited after ART failures, but an undetectable viral load may be possible nowadays. Adverse events are a fading problem of ART. Guidelines in acute HIV infection, in women, in pregnancy, and to prevent mother-to-child transmission and pre- and post-exposition prophylaxis are commented upon. Management of hepatitis B or C co-infection, other co-morbidities, and the characteristics of ART in HIV-2 infection are included."

Shedding of HIV-1 in semen was intermittent. The highest seminal viral loads were associated with a markedly increased polymorphonuclear granulocyte count, which reflects inflammation of the genital tract. Spermatozoa with undetectable levels of HIV-1 RNA or DNA were obtained regardless of the viral load in semen. In an HIV-1-infected man with intermittent seminal viral excretion, sperm processing was effective in obtaining spermatozoa without detectable HIV-1 genomes."
5450,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global major health problem. Currently, 10 genotypes (A-J) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are identified based on the nucleic acid sequence heterogeneity, and these genotypes have been shown to have distinct geographic distribution. Reports of the previous studies indicated that the genotype D is the predominant type among hepatitis B patients in different regions of Turkey. However, recent studies indicated that other HBV genotypes are also seen with an increasing rate. Although epidemiological and clinical information on genotype E infection is currently limited, it is known that genotype E infection is common in West and Central Africa. In this report, the first case of HBV genotype E infection in Turkey was presented. A 22-year-old Nigerian male employee who resided in Manisa for five years was admitted to Celal Bayar University Hospital Manisa, Turkey, for his routine check-up. Since HBsAg was found positive, other HBV markers were tested with a repeated serum sample. Laboratory findings were as follows; HBsAg (+), anti-HBs (-), HBeAg (-), anti-HBe (+), anti-HBc (+), anti-HCV (-), anti-HIV (-), ALT: 44 U/L and AST: 45 U/L. HBV-DNA level was detected as 700 IU/ml by real-time PCR (Artus HBV QS RGQ Qiagen, Germany). HBV-DNA isolated from the serum sample of the patient was amplified by PCR and polymerase gene segment of HBV was directly sequenced. UPGMA method was used for phylogenetic analysis and Inno-LIPA HBV genotyping method (Innogenetics, Belgium) was performed to determine multiple HBV genotype infection. On the basis of those methods the genotype of the virus was identified as genotype E. The partial sequences of the HBV polymerase gene were loaded to the international DNA data bank (GenBank) for contribution to the global HBV surveillance. This report emphasized that besides genotype D the other HBV genotypes could be found in Turkey. Since the patient was an inactive HBsAg carrier before his residence in Turkey, this case was regarded as an imported HBV genotype E case. In conclusion, detection of different HBV genotypes, their epidemiology and molecular characteristics are important for both national and global HBV surveillance and better clinical approach. "

Consistent with the data in healthy volunteers, a major interaction between esomeprazole and atazanavir-ritonavir was observed in this patient-marked reductions in atazanavir trough plasma concentration and in the area under the concentration-time curve from 0-24 hours-whereas an interaction between esomeprazole and fosamprenavir-ritonavir was not apparent in this patient."
2115,0.01,2.0000,"We retrospectively studied MBP genotypes in patients with malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriage, in clinics and hospitals in The Gambia. Children under 10 years with cerebral malaria and/or severe malarial anaemia, were compared with children with symptomatic, mild malaria, and controls of the same age and ethnicity. Adult TB cases with smear-positive pulmonary TB were compared with healthy blood donors from the same ethnic groups. Malaria cases and controls were tested for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and surface antigen (HBsAg). TB patients were tested for HIV antibodies. Genotyping used sequence-specific oligonucleotide analysis to identify MBP variant alleles. Overall, 46% (944/2041) of patients and controls were homozygous for the wild-type MBP allele, 45% (922/2041) were carriers of a single variant allele and 8.6% (175/2041) had two variant alleles. Neither homozygotes nor heterozygotes for MBP variants were at increased risk of clinical malaria, persistent HBV carriage or TB. The most common mutation in Africans, the codon 57 variant allele, was weakly associated with resistance to TB (221/794 in TB cases and 276/844 in controls, p = 0.037). MBP deficiency is not a significant risk factor for persistent HBV, severe malaria nor pulmonary TB in West Africa."

The prevalence of HIV-HCV coinfection was 78.4% (95% CI: 76.3-80.5). Intravenous drug use (OR = 7.2; 95% CI: 4.9-10.6), imprisonment (OR = 6.9; 95% CI: 4.6-10.4), tattooing in prison (OR = 2.61; 95% CI: 1.4-4.8), tattooing out of prison (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.3-3.1) and age (OR = 1.02 with increasing each year of life; 95% CI: 1.0-1.04) were significantly associated with HCV-HIV coinfection. Prevalence of HCV-HIV coinfection is high in Shiraz. Intravenous drug use and imprisonment are the main risk factors for this coinfection. Therefore, serious implementation of HIV and HCV testing, education, prevention, care and treatment programmes and evaluation of harm reduction programmes in prisons are very important."
2343,0.01,2.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in chronic hepatitis C patient. However, its significance and consequences are still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of occult HBV among HCV chronic carriers in France and to assess its impact on liver histology and response to antiviral therapy. To this end a cohort of 203 patients with chronic hepatitis C without hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has been examined. Serum HBV-DNA was detected using a highly sensitive PCR with primers located in the S and X genes. HBV viraemia levels were further determined by real-time PCR. Results showed that 47 of 203 (23%) patients had occult HBV infection with a low HBV load (10(2)-10(4) copies/ml) but significantly higher HCV-RNA titers (P < 0.05). No significant difference in age, gender, serum ALT level, HCV genotypes, and the presence of anti-HBc was observed between patients with or without HBV-DNA. When compared histologically, patients with occult HBV infection had higher activity (A2-A3 in 53% vs. 38%, P < 0.01) and more advanced fibrosis (60% vs. 33%, P < 0.001) than HBV-DNA negative cases. Sustained response to combination therapy against Chronic hepatitis C was achieved in 11 (28%) of 40 HBV-DNA positive cases, compared with 65 (45%) of the 144 HBV-DNA negative cases (P < 0.05). Among the 144 HBV-DNA negative HCV patients those with genotype 1 responded less frequently to therapy as compared to other genotypes infected patients (38% vs. 55%, P < 0.05). Surprisingly, when considering all patients studied, irrespective to the HBV-DNA status no significant difference was observed in response to combination therapy regarding HCV genotypes (39% vs. 44%, P > 0.05). In conclusion, HBV-DNA is found in 1/4 of French chronic hepatitis C patients regardless of the presence of anti-HBc. Such an occult HBV co-infection is associated with more severe liver disease, higher HCV viral load and decreased response to antiviral therapy irrespective of HCV genotypes."
2034,0.01,2.0000,"Due to their shared transmission route, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infections can be observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cases and are associated with more severe clinical courses. The detection of HBV DNA despite HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seronegativity is defined as occult HBV infections. According to the current seroepidemiological data, Turkey is classified as an intermediate HBV, low HIV endemic region. Occult HBV infections have previously been reported from Turkey but has not been investigated previously in HIV infected cohorts. The aim of this study was to identify occult HBV infections in HIV-infected persons. Twenty-eight HIV-positive cases followed-up at Hacettepe University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Unit were included in the study after informed consent. For the detection of HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HCV, commercial ELISA tests (Architect System, Abbott Diagnostics, USA) were employed. Absolute CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined via flow cytometry. HIV viral load was calculated via COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA) and the presence of HBV DNA was evaluated via COBAS TaqMan HBV Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA), in addition to a nested PCR assay targeting HBV S gene. The mean age of the study group was 43.2 (range between 27-65) years, 64.3% (18/28) of them were males and the mean duration of HIV infection was 4.2 (2-11) years. Mean CD4+ ve CD8+ T-cell counts were 414 ± 267 cells/mm3 and 854 ± 293 cells/mm3, respectively. Twenty-six (92.8%) cases were under highly-active anti-retroviral therapy at the time of the study, 88.5% of which included HBV-active drugs (lamivudine or tenofovir). HIV RNA were found negative in 11 (39.3%) patients, of those nine (81.8%) were the cases who treated with HBV-active antiretroviral therapy. HBsAg were negative in all of the 28 patients, while the positivity rates of anti-HBs and anti-HCV were 39.3% (11/28) and 3.6% (1/28), respectively. All samples were negative for HBV DNA via the commercial real-time PCR and in-house nested PCR assays. The absence of occult HBV in the study group may indicate the absence of occult HBV or suppression of viral replication due to the anti-retroviral therapy. In conclusion, further large-scale studies are required to fully understand the impact of occult HBV in HIV-infected patients in Turkey."

Intestinal immunization provided better protection from infection, as a significantly greater median number of challenges was necessary in this group than in the others. Oral and nasal vaccinations provided the most significant control of disease progression. Fifty percent of the orally and nasally vaccinated animals suppressed viremia to undetectable levels, while this occurred to a significantly lower degree in intestinally and vaginally vaccinated animals and in controls. Viremia remained undetectable after CD8(+) T-cell depletion in seven vaccinated animals that had suppressed viremia after infection, and tissue analysis for SIV DNA and RNA was negative, a result consistent with a significant reduction of viral activity. Regardless of the route of vaccination, mucosal vaccinations prevented loss of CD4(+) central memory and CD4(+)/α4β7(+) T-cell populations and reduced immune activation to different degrees. None of the orally vaccinated animals and only one of the nasally vaccinated animals developed AIDS after 72 to 84 weeks of infection, when the trial was closed. The levels of anti-SIV gamma interferon-positive, CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells at the time of first challenge inversely correlated with viremia and directly correlated with protection from infection and longer survival.

2578,0.01,2.0000,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis prompted the reintroduction of para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) to protect companion anti-tuberculosis drugs from additional acquired resistance. In sub-Saharan Africa, MDR/XDR tuberculosis with HIV coinfection is common, and concurrent treatment of HIV infection and MDR/XDR tuberculosis is required. Out of necessity, patients receive multiple drugs, and PAS therapy is frequent; however, neither potential drug interactions nor the effects of HIV infection are known. Potential drug-drug interaction with PAS and the effect of HIV infection was examined in 73 pulmonary tuberculosis patients; 22 (30.1%) were HIV coinfected. Forty-one pulmonary MDR or XDR tuberculosis patients received 4 g PAS twice daily, and in a second crossover study, another 32 patients were randomized, receiving 4 g PAS twice daily or 8 g PAS once daily. A PAS population pharmacokinetic model in two dosing regimens was developed; potential covariates affecting its pharmacokinetics were examined, and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted evaluating the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic index. The probability of target attainment (PTA) to maintain PAS levels above MIC during the dosing interval was estimated by simulation of once-, twice-, and thrice-daily dosing regimens not exceeding 12 g daily. Concurrent efavirenz (EFV) medication resulted in a 52% increase in PAS clearance and a corresponding >30% reduction in mean PAS area under the concentration curve in 19 of 22 HIV-M. tuberculosis-coinfected patients. Current practice recommends maintenance of PAS concentrations at ≥1 μg/ml (the MIC of M. tuberculosis), but the model predicts that at only a minimum dose of 4 g twice daily can this PTA be achieved in at least 90% of the population, whether or not EFV is concomitantly administered. Once-daily dosing of 12 g PAS will not provide PAS concentrations exceeding the MIC over the entire dosing interval if coadministered with EFV, while 4 g twice daily ensures concentrations exceeding MIC over the entire dosing interval, even in HIV-infected patients who received EFV.

The proportion of patients with a late diagnosis, carried out in full-blown AIDS stage, remains high. Skin and mucous membrane manifestations are not rare in these patients. Objective A demographic, clinical, and laboratorial characterization of patients with de novo HIV infection diagnosis made in the Department of Dermatology and Venereology of a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of adult patients newly diagnosed with HIV infection (reactive immunoassay for antibodies to HIV-1/HIV-2 or HIV p24 antigen) in the Dermatology and Venereology Department of a Portuguese central hospital in the period between January 2005 and December 2013. Results During the study period, 97 new cases were diagnosed, 70 men and 27 women. The median age at diagnosis was 36 years. Of the total, 50 cases were diagnosed with a concomitant sexually transmitted infection (STI), more frequently syphilis and ano-genital HPV infection. The remaining 47 patients were diagnosed with other dermatological conditions such as prurigo nodularis, psoriasis, and Kaposi's sarcoma. The duration of complaints that lead to medical attention ranged from <1 week to 8 years, being significantly lower in patients diagnosed with a concomitant STI ( p < 0.01). Basal viral load was also lower in this group of patients ( p < 0.05). Of all the new diagnosed cases, 80% of patients are currently retained in care. Conclusion This study grants a descriptive overview of de novo HIV infection diagnoses performed by dermatovenereologists in a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. As in the past, the importance of Dermato-Venereology for HIV infection diagnosis remains present in daily clinical practice."

The study was done at a major AIDS referral university teaching hospital. The participants were first- through fourth-year medical students in spring 1990. A 72% (of 451 students) response revealed that both surgery and emergency medicine were perceived as high risk of exposure specialties. Students indicated an overall willingness to care for HIV-positive patients (mean, 2.54) and a general adequacy of knowledge and experience (mean 2.54). The AIDS epidemic has had little influence for training, future career, and practice locations (mean, 4.06). Responses differed by class year. The later class years were more willing to care for HIV patients (P < .001) and indicated more knowledge and experience with HIV (P < .001). Influence on career, training and practice location choices were without class trend. In contrast to some studies, this group of medical students had relatively positive attitudes toward patients with HIV and were not particularly influenced by the AIDS epidemic regarding career choices."

Seventy-six participants with HIV who were on follow-up management at three non-governmental care and treatment agencies in south western, Nigeria were asked to complete a questionnaire detailing their demographic characteristics, duration of awareness of HIV status, medication status, membership of a support group, HIV-related knowledge (including number of workshops/seminars attended, reading of literature), and attitude toward their illness and treatment. Compared to those who did not belong to a support group, (34, 45%), those who did (42, 55%) were significantly more knowledgeable about HIV-related (t=4.02, p=0.00) and also reported more favorable attitudes toward the illness and its treatment (t=3.38, p=0.005). A multiple regression analysis indicated that group membership and a longer period of awareness of HIV infection contributed significantly to illness knowledge and attitudes. Age, sex, years of education, medication status, and employment status did not contribute significantly to these outcome variables. Individuals living with HIV/AIDS who belonged to a support group and had availed themselves of relevant literature were more knowledgeable and positive about their illness than those who did not belong to support groups. HIV/AIDS support group membership is an important component of psycho-social care in HIV/AIDS patients in Nigeria and should be encouraged."

Our initial cross-sectional study showed that this viremia is composed of viruses that lack new resistance mutations to the HAART regimen. Here we describe a longitudinal, clonal genotypic analysis of plasma virus loads in treated adults who had undetectable virus loads. We document a continuous production of virus in 8 HIV-1-infected adults who maintained suppression of viremia for up to 15 months. Using analytical approaches for distinguishing selected resistance mutations from nonselected mutations and polymerase chain reaction errors, we detected no evolution of resistance in the reverse-transcriptase and protease genes. Sporadic resistance mutations were detected in some viral clones that were not selected for subsequently. Thus, in some patients, HAART suppresses replication to a level that does not allow the evolution of drug resistance over a time frame of years."

Since different properties have been attributed to different Bifidobacterium species and there is no information available for the detailed changes in the genus Bifidobacterium in patients with chronic liver disease heretofore, it is meaningful to investigate the structure of this bacterium at the species level in these patients. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition of intestinal Bifidobacterium in patients with hepatitis B virus-induced chronic liver disease. Nested-PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), clone library, and real-time quantitative PCR were performed on the fecal samples of 16 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB patients), 16 patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis (HBV cirrhotics), and 15 healthy subjects (Controls). Though there was no significant difference in the diversity among the three groups (P = 0.196), Bifidobacterium dentium seems to be specifically enhanced in patients as the PCR-DGGE profiles showed, which was further validated by clone library and real-time quantitative PCR. In contrast to the B. dentium, Bifidobacterium                         catenulatum/Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum were detected less frequently in the predominant profile and by quantitative PCR in HBV cirrhotics than in the controls, and the level of this species was also significantly different between these two groups (P = 0.023). Although having no quantitative difference among the three groups, Bifidobacterium longum was less commonly detected in HBV cirrhotics than in CHB patients and Controls by quantitative PCR (P = 0.011). Thus, the composition of intestinal Bifidobacterium was deeply altered in CHB and HBV cirrhotic patients with a shift from beneficial species to opportunistic pathogens. The results provide further insights into the dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in patients with hepatitis B virus-induced chronic liver disease and might potentially serve as guidance for the probiotics interventions of these diseases."
7434,0.01,2.0000,"Around 5-10% of adults infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) develop a chronic liver disease such as chronic active hepatitis (CAH), and it is unclear whether the clinical outcome depends solely on the immune response or whether viral factors also play a role. In this study, a search was therefore made for nucleotide mutations in the basic core promoter (BCP) and amino-acid substitutions in the precore/core region of HBV infecting patients with CAH or with acute hepatitis. The nucleotide sequences of the BCP and of the precore/core region were determined in virus from ten patients with CAH and ten with acute hepatitis. The precore/core sequences were also analysed in 14 additional patients (6 with CAH, 8 with acute hepatitis). In seven of the ten patients with CAH, five types of mutations were found in the BCP. Deletions in the precore/core region were observed in six patients. In all six patients where only the precore/core region was studied, amino-acid substitutions were present. In contrast, in the ten patients with acute hepatitis studied for BCP, a mutation was found in the BCP of one patient only. Of the 18 patients in whom the precore/core was studied, three had an amino-acid substitution in this region. The results show a clear link between CAH and both HBV BCP and precore/core region mutations, suggesting these mutations may play a role in the persistence of HBV infection."

Here, we show that T cells stimulated for 1 day demonstrated delayed kinetics of viral reverse transcription and integration compared to cells stimulated for 2 days prior to infection. As a result, the efficiency of reverse transcription and integration inhibitors differs in these differentially stimulated cells. These studies increase our understanding of how T cells support viral replication and provide insight regarding the efficiency of antiretroviral therapy in lymphoid compartments."
819,0.01,2.0000,"In 2006, 2 million human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people living in low- to middle-income countries were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Although this is an improvement over previous years, significant operational challenges have inhibited progress toward universal access to HIV care and treatment. Despite these challenges, the intense efforts focused on addressing the HIV epidemic present an opportunity for overall health systems improvement in developing nations. In October 2006, Harvard University's Centers for AIDS Research, the Nelson Mandela School of Medicine, the Department of Health of KwaZulu-Natal, and the Medical Research Council of South Africa held a conference entitled ""The Realities of Antiretroviral Therapy Rollout: Challenges to Successful Programmatic Implementation"" in Durban, South Africa. The goal of the meeting was to bring together international and local leadership, including policy makers, health care workers, and funders, to propose an agenda that would address the challenges to more expeditious provision of HIV care and treatment in resource-limited settings."
2703,0.01,2.0000,"Dual HIV infection has been found in regions with high HIV prevalence and in populations infected with diverse strains of HIV. The prevalence of dual infection in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), where there is a high prevalence of HIV and an influx of immigrants who may be infected with different HIV subtypes, is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of dual infection in KZN. Eighty-three samples were obtained from chronically infected patients on ARV treatment from sites throughout KZN. Subtyping of the samples was performed using the heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA). Twelve samples that had possible dual infection by HMA were cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that there was no dual infection in these samples. Contrary to a previous study, we did not find dual infection in this region. The patients in our study may be different from those in the previous study in terms of transmission risk factors, treatment, and stage of infection (acute vs. chronic). This study may have important implications for vaccine development and for the pathogenesis and treatment of dual HIV infection."
1182,0.01,2.0000,"Lifelong ART is essential to reducing HIV mortality and ending the epidemic, however the interplay between socioeconomic position and long-term outcomes of HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown. Furthering the understanding of factors related to long-term ART outcomes in this important region will aid the successful scale-up of ART programs. We enrolled 559 HIV-infected Ugandan adults starting ART in 2004-2005 at the Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala, Uganda and followed them for 10 years. We documented baseline employment status, regular household income, education level, housing description, physical ability, and CD4 count. Viral load was measured every six months. Proportional hazard regression tested for associations between baseline characteristics and 1) mortality, 2) virologic failure, and 3) mortality or virologic failure as a composite outcome. Over ten years 23% (n = 127) of participants died, 6% (n = 31) were lost-to-follow-up and 23% (107/472) experienced virologic treatment failure. In Kaplan-Meier analysis we observed an association between employment and mortality, with the highest cumulative probability of death occurring in unemployed individuals. In univariate analysis unemployment and disease severity were associated with mortality, but in multivariable analysis the only association with mortality was disease severity. We observed an association between higher household income and an increased incidence of both virologic failure and the combined outcome, and an association between self-employment and lower incidence of virologic failure and the combined outcome when compared to unemployment. Formal education level and housing status were unrelated to outcomes. It is feasible to achieve good ten-year survival, retention-in-care, and viral suppression in a socioeconomically diverse population in a resource-limited setting. Unemployment appears to be related to adverse 10-year ART outcomes. A low level of formal education does not appear to be a barrier to successful long-term ART."
7972,0.01,2.0000,The Bel-1 protein of human foamy virus can activate transcription directed by the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The target sequence for Bel-1 is shown to lie within the HIV-1 LTR U3 region but does not coincide with any previously described factor-binding site. Gene expression directed by an HIV-1 LTR lacking functional sites for the inducible cellular transcription factor NF-kappa B was activated over 100-fold by coexpression of Bel-1. These observations suggest that Bel-1 has the potential to significantly enhance the level of HIV-1 gene expression in cells dually infected with HIV-1 and human foamy virus.

A total of 62 adult antiretroviral naïve HIV infected patients were enrolled in the study. Among them 26 had neurological complications of HIV infection (1st group), 16 patients had symptomatic disease without neurological involvements (2nd group) and 20 were asymptomatic patients (control group). Measurement of CD4 count was performed by indirect immunofluorescent assay by using the monoclonal antibodies and viral load (VL) in plasma--by RT PCR method. CD4 count was significantly lower in the 1st and 2nd group compared to the control group. There was correlation between the level of CD4 count and type of neurological manifestation. VL was comparable between the 1st and 2nd groups and was higher than in control group. There is a significant correlation between the level of CD4 count and type of neurological manifestation of HIV infection. Presence of neurological complication as well as other clinical manifestations is associated with decreased CD4 count and increased VL. Level of CD4 count can serve as an indicator for initiation of prophylaxis treatment of certain opportunistic pathogens."

1917,0.01,2.0000,"HIV-seropositive, active injection-drug users (IDUs), compared with other HIV populations, continue to have low rates of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use, contributing to disparities in their HIV health outcomes. We sought to identify individual-level, interpersonal, and structural factors associated with HAART use among active IDUs to inform comprehensive, contextually tailored intervention to improve the HAART use of IDUs. Prospective data from three semiannual assessments were combined, and logistic general estimating equations were used to identify variables associated with taking HAART 6 months later. Participants were a community sample of HIV-seropositive, active IDUs enrolled in the INSPIRE study, a U.S. multisite (Baltimore, Miami, New York, San Francisco) prevention intervention. The analytic sample included 1,225 observations, and comprised 62% males, 75% active drug users, 75% non-Hispanic blacks, and 55% with a CD4 count <350; 48% reported HAART use. Adjusted analyses indicated that the later HAART use of IDUs was independently predicted by patient-provider engagement, stable housing, medical coverage, and more HIV primary care visits. Significant individual factors included not currently using drugs and a positive attitude about HAART benefits even if using illicit drugs. Those who reported patient-centered interactions with their HIV primary care provider had a 45% greater odds of later HAART use, and those with stable housing had twofold greater odds. These findings suggest that interventions to improve the HIV treatment of IDUs and to reduce their HIV health disparities should be comprehensive, promoting better patient-provider engagement, stable housing, HAART education with regard to illicit drug use, and integration of drug-abuse treatment with HIV primary care."

Viral load is usually low in HIV-2 patients; similarly tempo of disease progression is also slow. Treatment of SCC of buccal mucosa with or without HIV infection is not different. Protease inhibitor-based anti-retroviral therapy is an appropriate treatment for HIV-2 infection. "

Two different HBV genotypes were identified in this patient. A search of the medical literature indicated this report is the first to describe a multiple silent HBV infection in an HIV/HCV-coinfected-patient. The elevated incidence of the anti-HBc alone pattern in HIV-positive patients and the increasing number of silent HBV infections detected in those patients demonstrate the need to carefully examine HIV-positive patients for occult HBV infection. In addition, it appears necessary to thoroughly study such patients in order to evaluate the impact of mixed HBV infection and triple HIV/HCV/HBV infection on morbidity."
6417,0.01,2.0000,"Restoration of anti-viral immune response may be a requisite for sustained virological response to treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients. Over a 13-month period, we examined the dynamics of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific CD8+ cells in six human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A2+ hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)+ 'immunotolerant' chronic hepatitis B patients treated sequentially with corticosteroid and lamivudine. Our results show that the combination treatment did not result in a sustained restoration of anti-viral specific CD8+ cells in five of the six patients studied. However, HBV-specific CD8+ cells, despite being severely compromised, were not totally deleted. Paradoxically, steroid treatment was not associated with inhibition but with a minimal increase of the HBV-specific CD8 response, and we observed that nucleocapsid-specific CD8 responses were not rescued by stable and prolonged inhibition but became detectable after rapid rebounds of HBV replication. In most patients, the transient and minimal restoration of HBV-specific immunity was not associated with clinical benefits. Our results describe a dynamic relationship between HBV-specific CD8+ cells and HBV-DNA values, that could potentially be used for a better design of HBV treatment in HBeAg+ 'immunotolerant' chronic hepatitis B patients."
8496,0.01,2.0000,"RNA interference (RNAi) was reported to block hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene expression and replication in vitro and in vivo. However, it remains a technical challenge for RNAi-based therapy to achieve long-term and complete inhibition effects in chronic HBV infection, which presumably requires more extensive and uniform transduction of the whole infected hepatocytes. To increase the in vivo transfection efficiency in liver, we used a double-stranded adeno-associated virus 8-pseudotyped vector (dsAAV2/8) to deliver shRNA. HBV transgenic mice were used as an animal model to evaluate the inhibition effects of the RNAi-based gene therapy. A single administration of dsAAV2/8 vector, carrying HBV-specific shRNA, effectively suppressed the steady level of HBV protein, mRNA and replicative DNA in liver of HBV transgenic mice, leading to up to 2-3 log(10) decrease in HBV load in the circulation. Significant HBV suppression sustained for at least 120 days after vector administration. The therapeutic effect of shRNA was target sequence dependent and did not involve activation of interferon. These results underscore the potential for developing RNAi-based therapy by dsAAV2/8 vector to treat HBV chronic infection, and possibly other persistent liver infections as well."

5786,0.01,2.0000,"Patients with treated HIV-1-infection experience earlier occurrence of aging-associated diseases, raising speculation that HIV-1-infection, or antiretroviral treatment, may accelerate aging. We recently described an age-related co-methylation module comprised of hundreds of CpGs; however, it is unknown whether aging and HIV-1-infection exert negative health effects through similar, or disparate, mechanisms. We investigated whether HIV-1-infection would induce age-associated methylation changes. We evaluated DNA methylation levels at >450,000 CpG sites in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of young (20-35) and older (36-56) adults in two separate groups of participants. Each age group for each data set consisted of 12 HIV-1-infected and 12 age-matched HIV-1-uninfected samples for a total of 96 samples. The effects of age and HIV-1 infection on methylation at each CpG revealed a strong correlation of 0.49, p<1 x 10(-200) and 0.47, p<1 x 10(-200). Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified 17 co-methylation modules; module 3 (ME3) was significantly correlated with age (cor=0.70) and HIV-1 status (cor=0.31). Older HIV-1+ individuals had a greater number of hypermethylated CpGs across ME3 (p=0.015). In a multivariate model, ME3 was significantly associated with age and HIV status (Data set 1: βage=0.007088, p=2.08 x 10(-9); βHIV=0.099574, p=0.0011; Data set 2: βage=0.008762, p=1.27 x 10(-5); βHIV=0.128649, p=0.0001). Using this model, we estimate that HIV-1 infection accelerates age-related methylation by approximately 13.7 years in data set 1 and 14.7 years in data set 2. The genes related to CpGs in ME3 are enriched for polycomb group target genes known to be involved in cell renewal and aging. The overlap between ME3 and an aging methylation module found in solid tissues is also highly significant (Fisher-exact p=5.6 x 10(-6), odds ratio=1.91). These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection is associated with methylation patterns that are similar to age-associated patterns and suggest that general aging and HIV-1 related aging work through some common cellular and molecular mechanisms. These results are an important first step for finding potential therapeutic targets and novel clinical approaches to mitigate the detrimental effects of both HIV-1-infection and aging."

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and occult HBV (presence of HBV-DNA in the absence of HBsAg) in a rural, South African cohort. The results were compared to various ethnic groups in a Dutch cohort of people infected with HIV. Antiretroviral-naïve individuals with HIV from both a rural South African clinic (n = 258), and a Dutch University hospital (n = 782), were included. Both serological (HBV and HCV) and molecular (occult HBV) assays were performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to define independent predictors of a hepatitis co-infection. HBV and HCV prevalence rates in the South African cohort were exceptionally low (0.4%, 1/242 and 0.8%, 2/242, respectively), compared to those observed in Caucasians (HBV 4.4% and HCV 10.9%) and African immigrants (HBV 8.9% and HCV 4.8%). Conversely, occult HBV was observed in a considerable proportion (10%, 6/60) of South African patients who were anti-HBc-positive but HBsAg-negative. Occult infections were less frequent in Caucasians and Africans in the Dutch cohort (3.2% and 1.4%, respectively). Independent predictors for occult HBV were not identified, but a trend towards more occult HBV at lower CD4 counts was observed. Local HBV/HCV prevalence data are needed to optimize vaccination and antiretroviral treatment strategies. Occult HBV in patients with HIV may be missed regularly when molecular analyses are not available."

The effect of Rev on protein and RNA expression of HIV-1 protease (PR)-containing constructs was investigated utilizing transient transfection of COS cells. Rev, through the Rev response element (RRE), resulted in a large increase in proteolytic activity and cytoplasmic RNA accumulation. Furthermore, Rev increased the level of total RNA produced by a PR-containing construct. The increase in cytoplasmic RNA accumulation in the presence of Rev indicated the presence of cis-acting repressor sequences (CRS) within the RNA produced by this construct. Therefore, components of the construct were analyzed for CRS activity. PR sequences in both sense and antisense orientations exhibited CRS activity. RRE sequences alone conferred a small CRS effect. Additional CRS activity was present within an unspliced RNA containing only nef and LTR sequences. These results indicate a novel form of cis-acting repressor activity within HIV-1 PR; this activity is exerted regardless of the orientation of PR and appears to function at the level of cytoplasmic or nuclear RNA stability."

This increase can only be partly explained by a higher migratory flow and might reflect a delayed access to health facilities and to antiretroviral therapy in migrants. We performed a survey for the year 2003 of HIV-infected immigrants to Italy from countries outside the European Union to verify which factors might influence a lack of access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Italian centers of infectious diseases were requested to send sociodemographic and clinical data of HIV-infected immigrant patients. A total of 553 HIV-infected immigrants (49.9% women) were evaluated, representing 6.5% of all HIV-infected patients from these centers. The mean duration of residency in Italy was 6.6 +/- 5.0 years. The country of origin was Africa (64.5%), North and South America (24.2%), Eastern Europe (7.0%), and Asia (3.8%). A total of 407 of 553 patients (73.6%) were taking antiretroviral drugs at the time of screening. Females presented a younger age (p = 0.001), a lower frequency of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stage B/C (p = 0.008) and a more frequent heterosexual exposure to HIV (p < 0.001), while no differences were observed for time of first positive serology (p = 0.7). CD4 cell count (p = 0.9) and log plasma HIV-RNA (p = 0.1). Characteristics of HAART patients were compared to those of nontreated patients, despite a CD4 cell count less than 350 cells/mm(3).

6602,0.01,2.0000,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in many developing and developed nations, leading to talk of the ""twin epidemics."" The latest projections from the International Diabetes Federation suggest that 190 million people worldwide currently have type 2 diabetes. In addition, > or = 300 million people worldwide have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). These statistics represent an epidemic of major proportions--possibly the largest epidemic in human history--in terms of glucose intolerance and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk because individuals with IGT are at substantially higher risk for diabetes and CVD than are members of the general population. Along with IGT, the metabolic syndrome comprises other major CVD risk factors, including insulin resistance, central obesity, and dyslipidemia; insulin resistance has been implicated as the single most common cause of the syndrome. Although the exact prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is unknown, the syndrome is widespread among adults in developed nations, becoming more prevalent with age. Epidemiologic data suggest that in patients with schizophrenia or affective disorders, both diabetes and obesity are 1.5 to 2.0 times more prevalent than in the general population. Furthermore, because adverse effects of certain therapies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and psychiatric disorders increase the risk for developing diabetes, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome, such therapies should be carefully chosen, particularly considering CVD risk. Appropriate therapy may be determined via screening of patients for levels of fasting blood glucose and lipids, as well as other CVD risk factors, before initiating use of second-generation antipsychotic agents or highly active antiretroviral therapy."
3118,0.01,2.0000,"Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanism of this association is unclear. In this study, we examined the potential defects in upstream insulin signaling pathways in liver specimens obtained from nonobese/nondiabetic subjects with HCV infection. Fasting liver biopsy specimens were obtained from 42 HCV-infected subjects and 10 non-HCV-infected subjects matched for age and body mass index. Liver tissues were exposed to insulin and examined for the contents and phosphorylation/activation status of the upstream insulin signaling molecules by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. HCV infection resulted in a trend toward a 2-fold to 3-fold increase in insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 contents when compared with non-HCV. In contrast, insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was decreased by 2-fold in HCV-infected subjects compared with non-HCV-infected subjects (P <.05). The observed reductions in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation were accompanied by a 3.4-fold decrease in IRS-1/p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) association and a 2.5-fold decrease in IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase enzymatic activity (P <.05 vs. non-HCV). This was accompanied by a marked reduction in insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation without any alterations in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. Cellular contents of the hepatic p85 subunit of PI3-kinase were comparable between HCV-infected and non-HCV-infected subjects. In conclusion, we found that (1). HCV infection leads to a postreceptor defect in IRS-1 association with the IR and (2). insulin signaling defects in hepatic IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3-kinase association/activation may contribute to insulin resistance, which leads to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with HCV infection."
6706,0.01,2.0000,"The pathophysiology of insulin resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS) is not fully clarified. We investigated 18 men with HALS and 18 HIV-positive males without lipodystrophy (control subjects). Duration and modality of antiretroviral therapy were similar between study groups. A hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp showed an impaired glucose disposal rate (GDR) in HALS patients (5.6 v 8.3 mg glucose/min. kg(FFM), P =.0006). As demonstrated by indirect calorimetry, HALS patients showed an impaired nonoxidative glucose metabolism (NOGM, 2.2 v 4.2, P =.006), whereas levels of basal and insulin-stimulated oxidative glucose metabolism (OGM) (2.4 v 2.3, P =.55, and 3.3 v 4.0, P =.064, respectively) were not significantly different between groups. Despite comparable total fat masses, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans showed that the percentage of limb fat (ie, peripheral-fat-mass/[peripheral-fat-mass + trunk-fat-mass]. 100%) was reduced in HALS patients (36% v 46%, P =.0002). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that percentage of limb fat explained 53% of the variability of GDR and 45% of the variability of NOGM in HALS patients. In HALS patients, leg fat mass correlated positively with NOGM (r =.51, P <.05), whereas abdominal fat mass and NOGM did not correlate (P =.91). Analyzing the relationship between first phase insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, 6 HALS patients compared with none of the control subjects exhibited impaired insulin secretion (P <.05). Our data suggest that fat redistribution independently of antiretroviral therapy is highly related to insulin resistance in HALS patients. Furthermore, in HALS patients, impaired glucose metabolism most likely relates to decreased NOGM and to defects in beta-cell function."

Eighty-six percent of 15,302 residents indicated a facility/clinician for routine medical services; 60% reported active (within the past year) attendance. Only 34% reported a previous HIV test, and self-reported HIV prevalence was 6%. Active attendees lived only slightly closer to their reported service site (2.8 versus 3.1 km; P < 0.001) compared with inactive attendees. Multivariate analysis showed that younger respondents (< 30 years of age) and active and inactive attendees were more likely to report an HIV test compared with non-attendees; men were less likely to report HIV testing. Despite traveling farther for HIV services (median distance = 4.4 km), 77% of those disclosing HIV infection reported HIV care enrollment. Men and younger respondents were less likely to enroll in HIV care. Socioeconomic status was not associated with HIV service use. Distance did not appear to be the major barrier to service receipt. The health and demographic surveillance system data identified patterns of service use that are useful for future program planning."
8433,0.01,2.0000,"In order to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in Royal Australian Navy personnel and to formulate policies for their education, screening and vaccination, a voluntary survey was undertaken. Seven hundred and forty-eight subjects completed a questionnaire that provided details of age, sex, rank, ethnic origin, service abroad, length of service, history of tattooing, liver disease and blood transfusions. Serum was assayed by radioimmunoassay for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (antiHBs) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (antiHBc). The presence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection was correlated with ""risk factors"" by means of the chi 2 test of independence. Fourteen (74%) of 19 personnel from the Pacific Islands, Asia and Africa who were excluded from analysis showed one-or-more such markers. The prevalence of any marker of hepatitis B virus infection was 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9%-5.9%). The individual markers HBsAg, antiHBs and antiHBc were found in 0.4% (95% CI, 0.1%-1.2%), 3.6% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.9%) and 3.9% (95% CI, 2.5%-5.3%) of subjects, respectively. The annual attack rate was estimated to be less than 1%. Factors which had a significant correlation with an increased prevalence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection included tattooing (especially if this had been performed in Asia), age, the duration of service and service abroad. Based on these data, and given the reduced cost of hepatitis B vaccines, vaccination now is considered worth while. A policy of vaccinating all personnel who may be required for service at sea, and others at risk, now is in effect. Educational programmes that are aimed at minimizing the risk of exposure to hepatitis B and other viral infections have been instituted."

4025,0.01,2.0000,"We have used the technique of backcalculation to estimate the number of persons in Canada who have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) as of July 1989. We first corrected national AIDS surveillance data in Canada for reporting delay and for underreporting. We then used standard Weibull natural history models as well as an alternative progression model in which the hazard of AIDS was dampened in keeping with observed data from large cohorts. Maximum likelihood techniques were then used to derive the infection curve most consistent with these data. Our best estimate based on this alternative progression model, an underreporting rate of 20%, and a logistic infection curve, was that approximately 29,000 persons in Canada had ever had HIV infection as of July 1989. In a sensitivity analysis utilizing less likely assumptions, the estimates ranged from 17,243 to 48,277. Restricting the same backcalculation process to females under the same assumptions, we estimated that approximately 2,900 females in Canada had ever had HIV infection as of July 1989. The best fitting step function infection curve in females appears to be continuing to rise. Given these estimates, it follows that approximately one in ten infected persons in Canada is female. However, females have only accounted for about one in seventeen AIDS cases. These data are in accord with the widespread impression that transmission of HIV to women has occurred more recently and is on the rise across Canada. The current estimate is lower than previous estimates which placed the number of infected Canadians in the 50,000 to 100,000 range. This lowering should not be taken to mean the situation is improving; rather, the early estimates were simply too high having been based on inadequate data and a rudimentary understanding of the natural history of HIV. Backcalculation is an excellent technique for modelling the incidence of HIV infection several years in the past, but it is not reliable for the most recent few years. A significant increase in HIV infection rates may have occurred in the past few years and it would be beyond the capacity of backcalculation to detect. Backcalculation and unlinked cross-sectional specimen surveys together have the potential to provide an effective means of monitoring the HIV epidemic."
7317,0.01,2.0000,"The accessibility of high active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for local human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients is improving in Rwanda. It is well known that this therapy is associated with serious adverse effects, such as metabolic and morphologic changes. One of the recommended preventive modalities for these complications is participation in physical activity. The current study aims to determine the anthropometric profile and physical activity levels among people living with HIV and receiving HAART in Kigali, Rwanda. The study was a cross-sectional, descriptive quantitative survey. The participant's levels of physical activity participation and their association with anthropometric profiles were measured, using a structured self-administered questionnaire for 407 clients passing through the clinics. Of the participants, approximately 70% were inactive and in addition, 40% were obese and 43% overweight. Obesity was found to be strongly associated with inactivity. Lack of motivation, and time as well as fear of worsening the disease were found to be barriers to participation in physical activity."
4864,0.01,2.0000,"HIV transmitted drug resistance (TDR) can compromise antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited countries like China where ART has been scaled up and thus leads to an important public health concern. The aim of the study was to elucidate the HIV-1 genetic characteristics and TDR in Hangzhou, China. Two-hundred eleven ART-naive, newly diagnosed individuals were enrolled during January and August 2013. Specimens were classified as recent or chronic infections using the BED capture enzyme immunoassay (BED-CEIA). The pol fragment covering the entire protease and the first 300 codons of the reverse transcriptase gene was amplified by RT-PCR and nested PCR. Genotypic drug resistance (DR) and phylogenetic analysis were performed on the 200 obtained sequences. Multiple genotypes were identified, including CRF01_AE (62.0%), CRF07_BC (31.0%), subtype B (2.0%), CRF08_BC (1.5%), CRF55_01B (1.0%), CRF18_cpx (0.5%), and unique recombinant forms (URFs, 2.0%). All the four URFs were found in men who have sex with men, consisting of a recombination of CRF01_AE with subtype B or CRF07_BC. The prevalence of primary DR in newly diagnosed individuals in Hangzhou was low (4.0%). The proportion of DR mutation to protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was 1.5%, 1.5%, and 1.0%, respectively. BED-CEIA revealed that 21.8% (45/211) of the specimens were associated with recent infections. The prevalence of TDR in recent infections was moderate (6.5%). High HIV diversity and relatively high prevalence of TDR in new infections has been found in Hangzhou, indicating an increasing challenge for future HIV prevention and treatment."

7712,0.01,2.0000,"There is substantial evidence for ongoing replication and evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), even in individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Viral evolution in the presence of antiviral therapy needs to be considered when developing new therapeutic strategies. Phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 sequences can be used for this purpose but may give rise to misleading results if rates of intrapatient evolution differ significantly. To improve analyses of HIV-1 evolution relevant to studies of pathogenesis and treatment, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical model that incorporates all available sequence data while simultaneously allowing the phylogenetic parameters of each patient to vary. We used this method to examine evolutionary changes in HIV-1 coreceptor usage in response to treatment. We examined patients whose viral populations exhibited a shift in coreceptor utilization in response to therapy. CXCR4 (X4) strains emerged in each patient but were suppressed following initiation of new antiretroviral regimens, so that CCR5-utilizing (R5) strains predominated. By phylogenetically reconstructing the evolutionary relationship of HIV-1 obtained longitudinally from each patient, it was possible to examine the origin of the reemergent R5 virus. Using our Bayesian hierarchical approach, we found that the reemergent R5 virus detectable after therapy was more closely related to the predecessor R5 virus than to the X4 strains. The Bayesian hierarchical approach, unlike more traditional methods, makes it possible to evaluate competing hypotheses across patients. This model is not limited to analyses of HIV-1 but can be used to elucidate evolutionary processes for other organisms as well."
9199,0.01,2.0000,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is widely used to treat hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients in the USA and Europe. No confirmed report of resistance selection during treatment with TDF in treatment-naïve and nucleoside/nucleotide analog-treated chronic hepatitis B patients has yet been reported. Here, we report for the first time a patient with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis who emerged with virologic breakthrough during combination therapy with TDF and entecavir (ETV), against ETV-resistant virus. A 51-year-old Japanese woman with hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg), whose genotype was C, received ETV monotherapy continuously followed by TDF and ETV combination therapy, because her HBV DNA levels had been >3.5 log copies/mL. At the start of combination therapy, amino acid substitutions of the reverse transcriptase (rt) gene, rtL180M, rtT184I/M, and rtM204V, were detected. After this, serum HBV DNA decreased to less than 2.1 log copies/mL and remained at this level until 31 months of combination therapy, when it again began to increase. Amino acid substitutions of rtL180M, rtS202G, and rtM204V emerged and were associated with an increase in serum HBV DNA at virologic breakthrough. Long-term therapy with TDF against the ETV-resistant virus has the potential to induce virologic breakthrough and resistance, and careful follow-up should be carried out. "
5770,0.01,2.0000,"The first HIV-infected patients were treated in 1986, however, at that time medicines inhibiting HIV replication were not available. Solely the complications of AIDS and opportunistic infections could be treated. The HIV replication inhibition capacity of antiretroviral nucleoside and ribavirin were tested in Hungary in 1987, an early date even in international practice. The first nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), azidothymidine, presently called zidovudine (ZDV), was introduced in 1989. By giving patients the appropriate dosage of this, the progression of the disease could be delayed by approximately 6 months to one year. In 1991, the application of two new NRTI was commenced, namely zalcitabine (DDC) and didanosine (DDI). These medicines were applied partly in case of ZDV intolerance and as a part of the sequential monotherapy. In 1994 and 1995 two new NRTI's were introduce, namely stavudine (d4T) and lamivudine (3 TC). At that same time, to obtain a more effective replication inhibition method, a double NRTI combination became part of the therapeutic protocol. The year 1996 resulted in significant changes. At the beginning of the year, two compounds belonging to two new therapeutic procedures. These are saquinavir (SQV) and delavirdine (DLV) belonging to the groups of protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase, respectively. The so-called virus cocktails and the effective active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were applied and, later, to monitor the efficiency of the treatment, the opportunity was provided to measure the copy number of HIV-RNS. The treatment of the HIV disease entails a number of unanswered questions. The maximum result that can be achieved by using today's therapeutic methods is to prolong that particular phase of the HIV disease, which secures the patient a fairly good quality of life. The new combination of the antiretroviral compounds produced by the pharmaceutical industry provides better changes to prolong said period by years, sometimes decades. However, the real solutions to the problem are only theoretically known treatment procedures (gene therapy, cytokins) today."
9870,0.01,2.0000,"Human antibody response to Cryptosporidium parvum has been previously shown as involving immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG isotypes. The interest in anti-cryptosporidial IgA antibody response has been recently stimulated by studies on the therapeutic effects of secretory IgA antibodies to Cryptosporidium in animal models and in patients. In the present study, isotypes of serum anti-Cryptosporidium antibodies have been characterized in donors of the following categories: (a) healthy adults, (b) healthy children, (c) immunocompetent children with transient cryptosporidial diarrhea, (d) HIV-infected patients without clinical and parasitological evidence of Cryptosporidium infection and (e) AIDS patients with cryptosporidial diarrhea. Antibodies were detected using C. parvum oocysts purified by density gradient centrifugation from bovine faeces. The IgA antibodies were revealed using alpha-chain specific antibodies. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis with oocysts was used as control. Although high levels of serum antibodies of the IgA class were detected in some donors in the group of healthy adults, elevated values were consistently found in HIV-infected patients. Higher values were found in HIV patients with clinical cryptosporidiosis. The presence of a secretory component in serum IgA antibodies in these patients has been documented. Data indicate that IgA serum antibodies are produced as well as IgM and IgG antibodies upon contact with the parasite, and suggest that elevated IgA serum antibodies to Cryptosporidium are not associated with protection in HIV patients."
5997,0.01,2.0000,"We compared the lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses to Cryptosporidium parvum in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and -seronegative patients. The lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses (interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, gamma interferon, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) were assessed for 11 HIV-seropositive, Cryptosporidium-positive (group I) patients; 20 HIV-seropositive, Cryptosporidium-negative (group II) patients; 10 HIV-seronegative, Cryptosporidium-positive (group III) patients, including four post-renal transplant (group IIIa) and 6 presumably immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients; and 20 HIV-seronegative, Cryptosporidium-negative healthy individuals (group IV). No significant difference was observed in the number of patients showing positive lymphoproliferative responses in group I compared to group III (post-renal transplant [group IIIa] or immunocompetent [group IIIb]) patients, while a comparison of the median stimulation indices shows that responses were significantly lower in Cryptosporidium-infected, immunosuppressed (group I and IIIa) patients than in immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients. The number of patients showing positive responses and median stimulation indices was significantly higher for Cryptosporidium-infected (HIV-seropositive and -seronegative) individuals than for uninfected individuals, suggesting that Cryptosporidium induces significant in vitro lymphoproliferative responses in infected individuals. Cytokine levels, except for that of IL-5, were significantly higher in Cryptosporidium-infected (groups I and III) individuals than in uninfected (groups II and IV) individuals. There was no significant difference between the group I and III patients and between Cryptosporidium-infected immunosuppressed (group I or IIIa) and immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients."
531,0.01,2.0000,"The authors reviewed the medical records of 194 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients newly diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis and all 3,564 patients with newly diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at San Francisco General Hospital for the period 1986-1992. The study was designed to address three questions: 1) How do AIDS patients who present with cryptosporidiosis differ from other patients with AIDS? 2) What factors are associated with survival among AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis? 3) Does a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis impact survival after AIDS diagnosis? A total of 194 cases of cryptosporidiosis among HIV-infected patients were identified during the study period. Of the 194 patients, 109 (56%) had no prior diagnosis of AIDS. These 109 patients represented 3.1% of the 3,564 newly diagnosed cases of AIDS in the same period. Among the 134 patients with CD4 T-lymphocyte counts performed within 3 months of Cryptosporidium diagnosis, 34 (25%) had CD4 counts greater than 209 cells/ml. In a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the incidence of Cryptosporidium was related to ethnicity (for blacks vs. whites, matched odds ratio (OR) = 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.73), CD4 count (for a CD4 count of < or = 53 cells/ml vs. > 53 cells/ml, matched OR = 12.60, 95% CI 4.01-39.61), and age (for a 10-year increase, matched OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.98). Two factors measured at the time of Cryptosporidium diagnosis were identified as being independently associated with survival (p < 0.001) in the proportional hazards model: CD4 count < or = 53 cells/ml versus > 53 cells/ml (relative hazard = 6.18, 95% CI 2.99-12.76) and hematocrit < or 37% versus > 37% (relative hazard = 2.27, 95% CI 1.22-4.22). The median durations of survival in the four subgroups of Cryptosporidium-infected patients defined by these two variables differed significantly from each other (range, 204-1,119 days). Cryptosporidiosis as an initial AIDS-defining diagnosis was associated with an elevated relative hazard of death in comparison with other AIDS-defining diagnoses (relative hazard = 2.01, 95% CI 1.38-2.93). These data identify the groups of HIV-infected individuals at risk for presentation with symptomatic Cryptosporidium infection; the distinct survival patterns among subgroups of those patients already infected with this parasite; and the survival of AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis relative to patients with other AIDS-defining conditions. Such information is necessary for the design of prospective studies, the development of prophylactic strategies, the evaluation of candidate therapies, and the provision of prognostic information to patients."
9690,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is a significant cause of morbidity. The requirements for HIV adaptation to the CNS for neuropathogenesis and the value of CSF virus as a surrogate for virus activity in brain parenchyma are not well established. We studied 18 HIV-infected subjects, most with advanced immunodeficiency and some neurocognitive impairment but none with evidence of opportunistic infection or malignancy of the CNS. Clonal sequences of C2-V3 env and population sequences of pol from HIV RNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma were correlated with clinical and virologic variables. Most (14 of 18) subjects had partitioning of C2-V3 sequences according to compartment, and 9 of 13 subjects with drug resistance exhibited discordant resistance patterns between the two compartments. Regression analyses identified three to seven positions in C2-V3 that discriminated CSF from plasma HIV. The presence of compartmental differences at one or more of the identified positions in C2-V3 was highly associated with the presence of discordant resistance (P = 0.007), reflecting the autonomous replication of HIV and the independent evolution of drug resistance in the CNS. Discordance of resistance was associated with severity of neurocognitive deficits (P = 0.07), while low nadir CD4 counts were linked both to the severity of neurocognitive deficits and to discordant resistance patterns (P = 0.05 and 0.09, respectively). These observations support the study of CSF HIV as an accessible surrogate for HIV virions in the brain, confirm the high frequency of discordant resistance in subjects with advanced disease in the absence of opportunistic infection or malignancy of the CNS, and begin to identify genetic patterns in HIV env associated with adaptation to the CNS."

This study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its related factors among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Thailand. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 259 patients at a tertiary care hospital. HRQOL was assessed using the Thai version of the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) questionnaire. Socio-demographics and clinical status were measured using a self-administered questionnaire. Multiple linear regression models were used to explore associations between socio-demographic status, clinical status, and HRQL. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that employment status was strongly related to better overall physical and mental health summary scores (PHS, MHS). In addition, patients with disclosure of HIV status, aged over 50 years, and having at least a rating of good health in the nurses' opinion were the independent positive predictive factors for overall PHS. While being on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and good compliance with ART were positive predictive factors for overall MHS. Improving and strengthening quality of life among PLWHAs are important goals for HIV/AIDS services. Regular assessment of HRQL can provide potential information for intervention to improve quality of life."

To determine whether individuals to whom variants with isolated NNRTI-associated drug resistance were transmitted are at increased risk of virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen, we identified minority variant resistance mutations in 33 individuals with isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance and 49 matched controls. We found similar proportions of overall and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated minority variant resistance mutations in both groups, suggesting that isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance may not be a risk factor for virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen."
8326,0.01,2.0000,"Prevalence and risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were studied in 2,587 pregnant women from three rural Egyptian villages in the Nile Delta being admitted to a prospective cohort study of maternal-infant transmission; 408 (15.8%) had antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) and 279 (10.8%) also had HCV-RNA. Fewer than 1% gave a history of jaundice or liver disease. Risk factors for anti-HCV included increasing age, low socioeconomic status and a history of blood transfusion or injection therapy for schistosomiasis. Sub-analyses after stratification of subjects by village revealed risks associated with specific venues for medical care, having a previous delivery attended by a traditional birth assistant (TBA), receiving medical care in a temporary clinic located in a mosque, overnight admission to a private doctor's clinic, and circumcision by a TBA or a 'health barber'. Our results suggest HCV causes very little detected illness in young adult Egyptian women and some sources of HCV transmission in rural Egypt in the past were associated with the provision of medical care and varied by location. Prevention should be focused on providing appropriate resources and health education should be given to formal and informal health care providers and should be sufficiently broad to adjust for local variations in exposures."
9539,0.01,2.0000,"Macrophages are early targets of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and serve as potential reservoirs for long-term infection. Through inflammatory mediators and direct cell contact, infected macrophages interact with neighboring cell populations, such as the endothelium, which create a microenvironment favorable for HIV-1 replication. We hypothesize that the transcriptional activator C/EBPbeta is critical for macrophages to respond to endothelial cell-derived signals. We show that endothelial cells significantly enhance C/EBPbeta binding activity and HIV-1 replication in macrophages. This increase in HIV-1 transcription is due to cell-cell contact as well as the production of soluble factors, mediated in part by ICAM-1 and interleukin 6, respectively. Furthermore, C/EBP factors are necessary for endothelial cell-dependent activation of HIV-1 transcription in macrophages, and HIV-1 induction can be inhibited by a C/EBP dominant-negative protein. In addition, C/EBP binding sites are necessary for efficient LTR activity and HIV-1 replication in the presence of endothelial cells. Taken together, these results indicate that endothelial cells, through the activation of C/EBPbeta, provide a microenvironment that supports HIV-1 replication in monocytes/macrophages."

Overall, the prevalence of OBI was 5.9% (95% confidence interval (CI(₉₅%): 3.8-8.7%); it was more frequently associated with ""anti-HBc alone"" serological marker (11.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 3.7, CI(₉₅%): 1.4-9.8), although it was also detected in the absence of any HBV serological marker (4.9%; CI(₉₅%): 2.3-9.1%). A low prevalence of anti-HCV-positive patients with OBI was found (3.1%; CI(₉₅%): 0.6-8.7%). HIV RNA plasma levels or other immunological/clinical characteristics were not significantly associated with OBI. All but one occult HBV infections were sustained by genotype D viral strains. OBI is relatively frequent in HIV-infected patients, although it does not seem to exert a relevant clinical impact.

We have studied the sequence evolution of the 5'UTR and a region of NS4 over 12 years in one human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive haemophilic patient and 14 years for one HIV negative haemophilic patient. One sample each year from the date of HCV infection to 1994 was analysed for genotype, virus load and nucleotide sequence of the two genetic loci. Both patients were infected with HCV genotype 1 throughout the study period. The virus load profiles were similar except that the profile for the HIV infected patient was displaced 4 years earlier relative to the other patient. Mean divergence of the quasispecies at both the 5'UTR and NS4 loci was higher in the HIV coinfected patient. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that evolution of the 5'UTR was host independent, whereas the NS4 region containing a CD8 restricted CTL epitope evolved in a host specific fashion."

To establish the prevalence of HDV infection in haemophilic patients and patients without haemophilia, 87 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were examined for serological evidence of delta hepatitis. In addition HBV, HDV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection markers were compared to clinical and histopathological outcome of hepatitis. Out of 46 haemophiliacs 30 (65%) were anti-HD-seropositive; 10 out of 30 anti-HD-positive patients (33%) had pathological liver function tests compared to 2 out of 16 anti-HD-negative haemophiliacs (13%). The rate of HIV infection did not differ between the HDV infected and the non-HDV infected individuals with haemophilia (17/27 anti-HD-positive patients versus 12/16 anti-HD-negative patients). Two haemophilic anti-HD-positive patients underwent liver biopsy, in both cases hepatitis D antigen (HDAg) was detected in the biopsies. Only 2 out of 41 patients without haemophilia were anti-HD-positive. Both had pathological liver function tests; chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis, respectively, were diagnosed and HDAg was found in the liver biopsies. Out of 39 anti-HD-seronegative patients without haemophilia, 26 (67%) were hepatitis B e antigen positive; in the sera of 20 patients (51%) HBV-DNA was demonstrated, but only 6 patients (15%) had pathological liver function tests. In conclusion a high seroprevalence of HDV infection was found in haemophilic patients treated with non-pasteurized commercial clotting factor concentrates.

6369,0.01,2.0000,"As of October 2006, 6 medications are approved in the United States for the management of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection: 2 formulations of interferon and 4 oral nucleos(t)ide analogues. For the treating practitioner, tailoring the pharmaceutical regimen according to patient features and clinical circumstances can be a challenge. First-line therapeutic regimens for the management of HBV infection include monotherapy with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agent that has potent on-treatment viral response and low rates of resistance; in the future, these regimens may include a combination of more than one nucleos(t)ide analogue or a combination of a nucleos(t)ide analogue and pegylated interferon. The oral nucleos(t)ide analogues are generally better tolerated than interferon; however, they can be expensive when administered for lengthy periods and can also lead to medication resistance. Lamivudine, the first approved nucleoside analogue for the treatment of HBV infection, has a very high resistance profile; in fact, lamivudine exposure increases viral resistance to other commercially available nucleos(t)ide analogues: entecavir, telbivudine, and adefovir. For these reasons, the 2007 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines no longer recommend lamivudine as first-line therapy for the management of HBV infection. A satellite symposium conducted during the 57th Annual Meeting of the AASLD in Boston, Massachusetts, presented approaches to customizing the management of chronic HBV infection. The presentation highlighted recent findings suggesting that early, profound, and sustained viral suppression improves the probability of sustained virologic response and reduces the likelihood of nucleos(t)ide resistance."
2301,0.01,2.0000,"Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can be successfully treated using nucleos(t)ide analogs (NA), but drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants frequently arise, leading to treatment failure and progression to liver disease. There has been much research into the mechanisms of resistance to NA and selection of these mutants. Five NA have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of CHB; it is unlikely that any more NA will be developed in the near future, so it is important to better understand mechanisms of cross-resistance (when a mutation that mediates resistance to one NA also confers resistance to another) and design more effective therapeutic strategies for these 5 agents. The genes that encode the polymerase and envelope proteins of HBV overlap, so resistance mutations in polymerase usually affect the hepatitis B surface antigen; these alterations affect infectivity, vaccine efficacy, pathogenesis of liver disease, and transmission throughout the population. Associations between HBV genotype and resistance phenotype have allowed cross-resistance profiles to be determined for many commonly detected mutants, so genotyping assays can be used to adapt therapy. Patients that experience virologic breakthrough or partial response to their primary therapy can often be successfully treated with a second NA, if this drug is given at early stages of these events. However, best strategies for preventing NA resistance include first-line use of the most potent antivirals with a high barrier to resistance. It is important to continue basic research into HBV replication and pathogenic mechanisms to identify new therapeutic targets, develop novel antiviral agents, design combination therapies that prevent drug resistance, and decrease the incidence of complications of CHB."
2155,0.01,2.0000,"Protease inhibitor (PI)-resistant HIV-1 has hardly ever been detected at failed boosted PI-based first-line antiretroviral regimens in clinical trials. However, this phenomenon has not been investigated in clinical practice. To address this gap, data from patients starting a first-line lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/rtv)-based therapy with available baseline HIV-1 RNA load, a viral genotype and follow-up viral load after 3 and 6 months of treatment were extracted from the Italian Antiretroviral Resistance Cohort Analysis (ARCA) observational database. Based on survival analysis, 39 (7.1%) and 43 (7.8%) of the 548 examined patient cases had an HIV-1 RNA >500 and >50 copies/ml, respectively, after 6 months of treatment. Cox proportional hazard models detected baseline HIV-1 RNA (RH 1.79, 95%CI 1.10-2.92 per 1-log(10) increase, P=0.02) and resistance to the nucleoside backbone (RH 1.04, 95%CI 1.02-1.06 per 10-point increase using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm, P<0.001) as independent predictors of HIV-1 RNA at >500 copies/ml, but not at the >50 copies/ml cutoff criteria. Higher baseline viral load, older patient age, heterosexual route of infection and use of tenofovir/emtricitabine were predictors of failure at month 3 using the 50-copy and/or 500-copy threshold. Resistance to LPV/rtv did not occur or increase in any of the available 36 follow-up HIV-1 genotypes. Resistance to the nucleoside backbone (M184V) developed in four cases. Despite the likely differences in patient population and adherence, both the low rate of virological failure and the lack of development of LPV/rtv resistance documented in clinical trials are thus confirmed in clinical practice."

Average direct hospital costs (L = Italian Lire, 1997 exchange rate US$ 1 = 1,704 Italian Lire) were L.23,725,584 (US$ 13,923.5), L.15,208,287 (US$ 8,925.1), L.11,942,761 (US$ 7,008.7) and L.7,660,942 (US$ 4,495.9) for the four groups of patients. More than 80% of patients in the first group and about 65% of patients in the second group received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The proportion of patients receiving HAART in the third and fourth group increased from 37.1% to 56.5% and from 15.3% to 31.5%. The number of hospital days observed in this study was much lower than previously published numbers in Italy. These results may indicate a shift of costs from hospitalisation to outpatient care and ARV."
7296,0.01,2.0000,"This study evaluates the impact of antiretroviral treatment (ART) on employment-related outcomes using prospective, longitudinal analysis. Starting in January 2008, 602 treatment-naïve clients in one rural clinic and in one clinic in the capital Kampala were interviewed about their medical history, and psychosocial and socioeconomic adjustment at baseline and at months 6 and 12. Half of the sample was eligible to receive ART, while the other half was also in HIV care, but not yet eligible for ART, therefore providing a comparison group that is similar to the treatment group in that its members are HIV-positive and have made the decision to enroll in HIV care. We found improvements in general health, reduction in the incidence of pain and health interfering with work, as well as improvements in work-related self-efficacy for both groups over time, but significantly more so for the group receiving ART treatment. At baseline, less than half of the people in the ART group worked, but after 6 months more than three quarters of them were working, surpassing the fraction of people working in the control group after 1 year. Another key finding of the study was the importance of mental health as a key mediator for employment-related outcomes. These data indicate that ART clients experience greater improvements compared to pre-ART clients, and not only with regard to general health, but also in restoring confidence in their ability to work, as well as actual work status."

The aim of this study was to assess the sero-virological prevalence of HEV in French HIV-infected patients."
9592,0.01,2.0000,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been identified as cofactors of HIV transmission. Greater understanding of local STI burdens can assist in the development of more effective STI and HIV prevention strategies. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and incidence of STIs among South Indian men and women identified to be at increased risk for HIV infection. Individuals at increased risk for HIV infection were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal study in Chennai, India (n = 480) between August 2002 and December 2003. Participants were enrolled from patients seeking services at an sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic and a confidential HIV testing and counseling program. The most common prevalent STIs were herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 (50% of women, 29% of men), syphilis (11% of women, 8% of men), and Trichomonas vaginalis (6% of women). At enrollment, women, participants with no schooling, participants with greater than four sex partners, and single participants were found to be at increased risk for HSV-2 infection (p < 0.05). The two most common incident STIs at 12 months were HSV-2 with 12% of men and 8% of women testing positive and hepatitis B with 2% of men and 5% of women testing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. In this cohort of South Indian men and women with a high background prevalence of HSV-2, suppressive therapy against herpes replication may have a substantial impact in reducing both HSV-2 transmission and HIV acquisition. With the high incidence of STIs, targeted prevention and clinical management strategies among individuals practicing high risk behaviors may help to slow the continued spread of HIV in India."
6020,0.01,2.0000,"Scaling up access to HIV viral load testing for individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy in low-resource settings is a global health priority, as emphasised by research showing the benefits of suppressed viral load for the individual and the whole population. Historically, large-scale diagnostic test implementation has been slow and incomplete because of service delivery and other challenges. Building on lessons from the past, in this Personal View we propose a new framework to accelerate viral load scale-up and ensure equitable access to this essential test. The framework includes the following steps: (1) ensuring adequate financial investment in scaling up this test; (2) achieving pricing agreements and consolidating procurement to lower prices of the test; (3) strengthening functional tiered laboratory networks and systems to expand access to reliable, high-quality testing across countries; (4) strengthening national leadership, with prioritisation of laboratory services; and (5) demand creation and uptake of test results by clinicians, nurses, and patients, which will be vital in ensuring viral load tests are appropriately used to improve the quality of care. The use of dried blood spots to stabilise and ship samples from clinics to laboratories, and the use of point-of-care diagnostic tests, will also be important for ensuring access, especially in settings with reduced laboratory capacity. For countries that have just started to scale up viral load testing, lessons can be learnt from countries such as Botswana, Brazil, South Africa, and Thailand, which have already established viral load programmes. This framework might be useful for guiding the implementation of viral load with the aim of achieving the new global HIV 90-90-90 goals by 2020."
1525,0.01,2.0000,"Natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is very rare. The authors encountered a case of NK/T-cell lymphoma in a 36-year-old man who presented with an ulcerative mass on both tonsils. During assessment, HIV positivity was noted. The EBV was detected by EBV-encoded RNA 1 messenger RNA in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction for EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1. On immunohistochemical staining, the infiltrated lymphoid cells of the tonsils demonstrated positvity for CD3, CD56, UCHL1, and granzyme, a finding compatible with NK/T-cell lymphoma. The patient received radiation therapy and chemotherapy, but died as a result of opportunistic infection of invasive aspergillosis after tumor recurrence. An autopsy was done with the consent of the patient's family. To our knowledge, this is the first case in an HIV patient of NK/T-cell lymphoma of the tonsils associated with EBV, confirmed by autopsy. NK/T-cell lymphoma should be considered in the HIV-positive patients with an ulcerating tonsillar mass."

4562,0.01,2.0000,"Introduction There are several classifications for abdominal hernias, and a non-traumatic lateral wall hernia (LAWH) is a rare type. We report the first case of a patient with LAWH infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Case History A 53-year-old HIV-infected male presented with an abdominal mass. The patient had a history of treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy. A LAWH was diagnosed based on physical examination and findings of computed tomography. Open mesh repair was undertaken successfully. The patient had no evidence of a recurrent hernia during 11 months of follow-up. Conclusions High intra-abdominal pressure and weak connective tissue can lead to LAWHs. Antiretroviral therapy and lipodystrophy can cause LAWHs in HIV-infected patients. "
2282,0.01,2.0000,"Health care workers with frequent blood contact are at high risk of infection with hepatitis B virus. We surveyed 154 physician anesthesiologists (MD) and certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA) at four university-affiliated medical centers to determine the prevalence of serologic markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Questionnaires were used to ascertain historical and demographic information, nonoccupational risk factors, and characteristics of the participants' anesthesia practice. The overall prevalence of seropositivity was 18.8% (range 10.2-30.3%), and there were no statistically significant differences among the four centers, MD and CRNA groups, or males and females. In contrast to other studies, the prevalence of seropositive markers did not increase with an increase in the participants' age or length of time in the specialty. For the groups sampled in this study, geographic location or type of practice did not influence the increased prevalence of HBV seropositivity in anesthesia personnel. The current methods of HBV infection control were not associated with a decreased prevalence of serum markers. The majority of the susceptible anesthesia personnel at these four institutions did not plan to receive the hepatitis B vaccine when surveyed at the time of this study."
5325,0.01,2.0000,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk's) have recently been suggested to regulate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcription. Previously, we have shown that expression of one cdk inhibitor, p21/Waf1, is abrogated in HIV-1 latently infected cells. Based on this result, we investigated the transcription of HIV-1 in the presence of chemical drugs that specifically inhibited cdk activity and functionally mimicked p21/Waf1 activity. HIV-1 production in virally integrated lymphocytic and monocytic cell lines, such as ACH(2), 8E5, and U1, as well as activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with syncytium-inducing (SI) or non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) HIV-1 strains, were all inhibited by Roscovitine, a purine derivative that reversibly competes for the ATP binding site present in cdk's. The decrease in viral progeny in the HIV-1-infected cells was correlated with a decrease in the transcription of HIV-1 RNAs in cells treated with Roscovitine and not with the non-cdk general cell cycle inhibitors, such as hydroxyurea (G(1)/S blocker) or nocodazole (M-phase blocker). Cyclin A- and E-associated histone H1 kinases, as well as cdk 7 and 9 activities, were all inhibited in the presence of Roscovitine. The 50% inhibitory concentration of Roscovitine on cdk's 9 and 7 was determined to be approximately 0.6 microM. Roscovitine could selectively sensitize HIV-1-infected cells to apoptosis at concentrations that did not impede the growth and proliferation of uninfected cells. Apoptosis induced by Roscovitine was found in both latent and activated infected cells, as evident by Annexin V staining and the cleavage of the PARP protein by caspase-3. More importantly, contrary to many apoptosis-inducing agents, where the apoptosis of HIV-1-infected cells accompanies production and release of infectious HIV-1 viral particles, Roscovitine treatment selectively killed HIV-1-infected cells without virion release. Collectively, our data suggest that cdk's are required for efficient HIV-1 transcription and, therefore, we propose specific cdk inhibitors as potential antiviral agents in the treatment of AIDS."
4623,0.01,2.0000,"Wasting remains a significant condition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection despite antiretroviral treatment. Early identification requires the measurement of various body composition parameters, particularly body cell mass (BCM). Anthropometry may provide some useful information. Cost and complexity issues make many body composition techniques unsuitable for the clinical setting. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) may be the best method available to caregivers for monitoring serial changes in BCM over time and for determining the occurrence of wasting. It is not useful, however, for detecting body composition changes in patients with fat redistribution syndromes. Portability, low cost, ease of use, and patient acceptance make anthropometry and BIA ideally suited for the clinical setting."
8417,0.01,2.0000,"HIV-positive refugees confront a variety of challenges in accessing and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and attaining durable viral suppression; however, there is little understanding of what these challenges are, how they are navigated, or how they may differ across humanitarian settings. We sought to document and examine accounts of the threats, barriers and facilitators experienced in relation to HIV treatment and care and to conduct comparisons across settings. We conducted semi-structured interviews among a purposive sample of 14 refugees attending a public, urban HIV clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (July-September 2010), and 12 refugees attending a camp-based HIV clinic in Kakuma, Kenya (February-March 2011). We used framework methods and between-case comparison to analyze and interpret the data, identifying social and environmental factors that influenced adherence. The multiple issues that threatened adherence to antiretroviral therapy or precipitated actual adherence lapses clustered into three themes: ""migration"", ""insecurity"", and ""resilience"". The migration theme included issues related to crossing borders and integrating into treatment systems upon arrival in a host country. Challenges related to crossing borders were reported in both settings, but threats pertaining to integration into, and navigation of, a new health system were exclusive to the Malaysian setting. The insecurity theme included food insecurity, which was most commonly reported in the Kenyan setting; health systems insecurity, reported in both settings; and emotional insecurity, which was most common in the Kenyan setting. Resilient processes were reported in both settings. We drew on the concept of ""bounded agency"" to argue that, despite evidence of personal and community resilience, these processes were sometimes insufficient for overcoming social and environmental barriers to adherence. In general, interventions might aim to bolster individuals' range of action with targeted support that bolsters resilient processes. Specific interventions are needed to address locally-based food and health system insecurities. "
8267,0.01,2.0000,"It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that efforts to optimize nutritional status through individualized medical nutrition therapy, assurance of food and nutrition security, and nutrition education are essential to the total system of health care available to people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection throughout the continuum of care. Broad-based efforts to improve health care access and treatment have stabilized HIV prevalence levels in many parts of the world and led to longer survival for people living with HIV infection. Confounding clinical and social issues, such as medication interactions, comorbidities, wasting, lipodystrophy, food insecurity, aging, and other related conditions further complicate disease management. With greater understanding of the mechanisms of HIV disease and its impact on body function, development of new treatments, and wider ranges of populations affected, the management of chronic HIV infection continues to become more complex and demanding. Achievement of food and nutrition security and management of nutrition-related complications of HIV infection remain significant challenges for clients with HIV infection and health care professionals. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, should integrate their efforts into the overall health care strategies to optimize their clinical and social influence for people living with HIV infection."
6842,0.01,2.0000,"Two cross-sectional surveys on hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were carried out among 1,033 volunteer first-time blood donors in five blood banks (3 private, 2 public) and among 201 prisoners in the Penitentiary Center of Industrial Activity, in Goiania, Central Brazil, between June 1988 and February 1989. Those surveys were part of a major study designed to estimate seroprevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBsAg markers by ELISA test, and to study risk factors associated with seropositivity. The presence of any serum marker was considered as previous exposure to HBV. A standard questionnaire was applied to both populations to evaluate previous blood transfusion, number of sexual partners, homo/bisexual activity, history of sexually transmitted diseases, drug abusers, use of parenteral medicine, acupuncture, tattooing and VDRL seropositivity. Seroprevalence varied from 12.8% to 26.4% in blood donors and prisoners, respectively, (p less than 0.05) and increased with age (X2 trend=14.0 p less than 0.05%). Prisoners had higher percentages of all risk factors investigated than blood donors, with the exception of number of sexual partners. Among all risk factors studied, age, imprisonment and tattooing were statistically associated with seropositivity, even after multivariate analysis controlling for age and reclusion. The paper discusses the methodologic issues related to this epidemiologic investigation."
4360,0.01,2.0000,"Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) used against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) need to be activated intracellularly to their triphosphate moiety to inhibit HIV replication. Intracellular concentrations of these NRTI triphosphates, especially zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP), are relatively low (low numbers of femtomoles per 10(6) cells) in HIV-infected patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Recently, several methods have used either high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with radioimmunoassay to obtain in vivo measurements of ZDV-TP. The limit of detection (LOD) by these methods ranged from 20 to 200 fmol/10(6) cells. In this report, we describe the development of a method to determine intracellular ZDV-TP concentrations in HIV-infected patients using SPE and HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry for analysis. The LOD by this method is 4.0 fmol/10(6) cells with a linear concentration range of at least 4 orders of magnitude from 4. 0 to 10,000 fmol/10(6) cells. In hispanic HIV-infected patients, ZDV-TP was detectable even when the sampling time after drug administration was 15 h. Intracellular ZDV-TP concentrations in these patients ranged from 41 to 193 fmol/10(6) cells. The low LOD obtained with this method will provide the opportunity for further in vivo pharmacokinetic studies of intracellular ZDV-TP in different HIV-infected populations. Furthermore, this methodology could be used to perform simultaneous detection of two or more NRTIs, such as ZDV-TP and lamivudine triphosphate."

We thus questioned which factors influenced the occurrence of fibrosis in a cohort of HIV/HCV coinfected intravenous drug user patients. HIV/HCV coinfected intravenous drug user patients naive of anti-HCV therapy for whom a liver biopsy was performed between 1996 and 2003 were retrospectively studied in three University hospitals in Paris and the Parisian region. One hundred and fifty two patients (131 men and 21 women; mean age 39.3+/-4.9 years) were studied. Most of them (62%) were treated with HAART. HCV genotypes included type 1 (N=78), type 2 (N=1), type 3 (N=38) and type 4 (N=35). Mean duration of HCV infection was 19.0+/-5.2 years. Sixty-six percent had minimal to moderate fibrosis (F0/F1/F2) and 34% severe fibrosis (F3/F4). Multivariate analysis retained METAVIR activity score (OR=2.60, 95%CI [1.46-4.64]; P=0.001), mixed pattern of steatosis (OR=3.29, 95%CI [1.24-8.71]; P=0.017) and a CD4 cell count<200/mm3 (OR=4.04, 9%CI [1.47-11.12]; P=0.007) as independent factors associated with severe fibrosis. HAART did not influence the occurrence of liver fibrosis. In this cohort of HIV/HCV coinfected intravenous drug user patients, METAVIR activity score, mixed steatosis and a low CD4 cell count were independent factors associated with severe liver fibrosis."
8238,0.005,1.0000,"The care of the HIV-infected patient in the emergency department has changed since the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy. This therapy has resulted in longer life expectancies and increased quality of life for HIV-infected patients, and in cases of treatment compliance and success, virtual elimination of AIDS-associated opportunistic infections. As a result, the emergency clinician is now more often confronted with adverse events related to medication and the diseases associated with aging and chronic disease. This issue focuses on the differences in evaluation of HIV patients on long-term therapy and patients with medication noncompliance and low CD4 counts, as well as recognition of life-threatening and rare opportunistic infections. Disease processes related to the effect of longstanding HIV infection, even with good control, on many organ systems are addressed. "
8828,0.005,1.0000,"We describe four patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had development of meningiomas. In contrast to those in the general population who have meningiomas, all our patients were young men; the mean age was 40 years (range, 32 to 50). Their risk behavior for HIV was homosexuality (three patients) and intravenous drug use (one patient). The CD4+ cell count in each of the three homosexual men was less than 50/microL and was 280/microL in the drug user. Imaging studies showed enhancing lesions in three of the patients. Although each of these meningiomas could have occurred in otherwise normal young to middle-aged men, we speculate that the meningiomas may have grown in these HIV-infected hosts because of either loss of immune function or dysregulation of cytokines."

8316,0.005,1.0000,"In contrast to HIV-infected humans, naturally SIV-infected sooty mangabeys (SMs) very rarely progress to AIDS. Although the mechanisms underlying this disease resistance are unknown, a consistent feature of natural SIV infection is the absence of the generalized immune activation associated with HIV infection. To define the correlates of preserved CD4(+) T cell counts in SMs, we conducted a cross-sectional immunological study of 110 naturally SIV-infected SMs. The nonpathogenic nature of the infection was confirmed by an average CD4(+) T cell count of 1,076 +/- 589/mm(3) despite chronic infection with a highly replicating virus. No correlation was found between CD4(+) T cell counts and either age (used as a surrogate marker for length of infection) or viremia. The strongest correlates of preserved CD4(+) T cell counts were a low percentage of circulating effector T cells (CD28(-)CD95(+) and/or IL-7R/CD127(-)) and a high percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells. These findings support the hypothesis that the level of immune activation is a key determinant of CD4(+) T cell counts in SIV-infected SMs. Interestingly, we identified 14 animals with CD4(+) T cell counts of <500/mm(3), of which two show severe and persistent CD4(+) T cell depletion (<50/mm(3)). Thus, significant CD4(+) T cell depletion does occasionally follow SIV infection of SMs even in the context of generally low levels of immune activation, lending support to the hypothesis of multifactorial control of CD4(+) T cell homeostasis in this model of infection. The absence of AIDS in these ""CD4(low)"" naturally SIV-infected SMs defines a protective role of the reduced immune activation even in the context of a significant CD4(+) T cell depletion."
1946,0.005,1.0000,"Vitamin D deficiency is associated with negative health outcomes, including infections. Vitamin D modulates inflammation and down-regulates the expression of calprotectin, a molecule which influences neutrophil functions and which has been linked to oral candidiasis (OC), the most prevalent oral lesion in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We hypothesized a positive association between vitamin D deficiency and OC, and that this effect was partially modulated by calprotectinemia. Plasma calprotectin and serum 25 (OH) vitamin D levels were measured in stored samples from 84 HIV-seropositive Chicago women enrolled in the Oral Substudy of the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). OC and vitamin D deficiency were diagnosed in, respectively, 14 (16.7%) and 46 (54.8%) of those studied. Vitamin D deficiency was positively associated with OC (p = 0.011) and with higher calprotectinemia (p = 0.019) in univariate analysis. After adjustment for CD4, HIV viral load, HIV treatment, and tobacco and heroin/methadone use, vitamin D deficiency remained a significant predictor of OC (OR 5.66; 95% confidence interval 1.01-31.71). This association weakened after adjustment for calprotectinemia, supporting a role for calprotectinemia as a moderator of this effect. These findings support studies to examine the effect of vitamin D status on calprotectinemia, neutrophil functions, and opportunistic mucosal infections in HIV."

It is thus important to establish small animal models to study HBV infection, persistence, clearance and the immunopathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B. In this review, we briefly summarize currently available animal models for HBV research, then focus on mouse models, especially the recently developed humanized mice that can support HBV infection and immunopathogenesis in vivo.

3555,0.005,1.0000,"Sooty mangabeys (SMs) naturally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) do not develop AIDS despite high levels of virus replication. At present, the mechanisms underlying this disease resistance are poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that SIV-infected SMs avoid immunodeficiency as a result of virus replication occurring in infected cells that live significantly longer than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected human cells. To this end, we treated six SIV-infected SMs with potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) and longitudinally measured the decline in plasma viremia. We applied the same mathematical models used in HIV-infected individuals and observed that SMs naturally infected with SIV also present a two-phase decay of viremia following ART, with the bulk (92 to 99%) of virus replication sustained by short-lived cells (average life span, 1.06 days), and only 1 to 8% occurring in longer-lived cells. In addition, we observed that ART had a limited impact on CD4(+) T cells and the prevailing level of T-cell activation and proliferation in SIV-infected SMs. Collectively, these results suggest that in SIV-infected SMs, similar to HIV type 1-infected humans, short-lived activated CD4(+) T cells, rather than macrophages, are the main source of virus production. These findings indicate that a short in vivo life span of infected cells is a common feature of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic primate lentivirus infections and support a model for AIDS pathogenesis whereby the direct killing of infected cells by HIV is not the main determinant of disease progression."
7720,0.005,1.0000,"This study was conducted in order to help determine the key factors that predict adherence to antiretroviral medications. A total of 115 HIV/AIDS patients who were having trouble adhering to their antiretroviral regimens completed face-to-face interviews in which adherence levels, medication side effects, mental health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics, substance use and health anxiety were assessed. Three measures of adherence were used: adherence over the past three days, adherence over the past week, and adherence over the past month. Logistic regression analyses indicated strongest prediction of three-day adherence, with mental health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics and side effects contributing to prediction. Past week adherence was associated with age and social support measures, and showed a marginal association with side effects. Past month adherence was less strongly predicted, with social support and alcohol use contributing to prediction. Thus, a variety of factors were found to determine adherence, and implications of the findings for adherence models and interventions are discussed."
5597,0.005,1.0000,"Little is known of the peptide ligands expressed in vivo on antigen-presenting cells (APC) or of the APC lineages involved. In this study we have addressed this question using HLA-DRbeta1*0101-restricted CD4 T cell clones (TLC) specific for a synthetic peptide based on the HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop consensus sequence for the Clade B isolates predominantly found in European and North American patients. These TLC were found to respond, in a dose-dependent manner, to freshly isolated HIV-infected patient APC in the absence of exogenously added peptides. Further APC purification showed that the naturally expressed peptide ligands were present in both the APC lineages shown to be infected with the virus and were most strongly detectable on purified blood dendritic cells. Peptides based on consensus sequences of viruses isolated from one of the patients over the period when naturally expressed peptide ligands could be detected were all found to stimulate TLC proliferation. These studies, therefore, show that peptide ligands derived from natural infection are detectable on APC lineages, particularly on dendritic cells which play an important role in the immune response to viruses. Even small differences in sequence between the vaccine isolate and the natural infection, if they occur in the key residues of protective T cell epitopes, could therefore have a profound effect on the efficacy of vaccines against viruses with high rates of mutation."

In a nationally representative sample of HIV-infected adults receiving medical care, 86% self-reported taking all ART doses in the past 72 hours. Overall, 20% reported using adherence support services and 2% reported an unmet need for services. If all nonadherent persons not receiving adherence support and all persons with a self-perceived unmet need for adherence support accessed services, resources to support ∼42,673 additional persons would be needed. Factors associated with lower adherence included younger age, female gender, depression, stimulant use, binge alcohol use, greater than once-daily dosing, longer time since HIV diagnosis, and patient beliefs. Predictors of adherence are multifactorial so multiple targeted strategies to improve adherence are warranted. Providing adherence support services to all those in need may require additional resources. "

7926,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects target cells by binding to CD4 and a chemokine receptor, most commonly CCR5. CXCR4 is a frequent alternative coreceptor (CoR) in subtype B and D HIV-1 infection, but the importance of many other alternative CoRs remains elusive. We have analyzed HIV-1 envelope (Env) proteins from 66 individuals infected with the major subtypes of HIV-1 to determine if virus entry into highly permissive NP-2 cell lines expressing most known alternative CoRs differed by HIV-1 subtype. We also performed linear regression analysis to determine if virus entry via the major CoR CCR5 correlated with use of any alternative CoR and if this correlation differed by subtype. Virus pseudotyped with subtype B Env showed robust entry via CCR3 that was highly correlated with CCR5 entry efficiency. By contrast, viruses pseudotyped with subtype A and C Env proteins were able to use the recently described alternative CoR FPRL1 more efficiently than CCR3, and use of FPRL1 was correlated with CCR5 entry. Subtype D Env was unable to use either CCR3 or FPRL1 efficiently, a unique pattern of alternative CoR use. These results suggest that each subtype of circulating HIV-1 may be subject to somewhat different selective pressures for Env-mediated entry into target cells and suggest that CCR3 may be used as a surrogate CoR by subtype B while FPRL1 may be used as a surrogate CoR by subtypes A and C. These data may provide insight into development of resistance to CCR5-targeted entry inhibitors and alternative entry pathways for each HIV-1 subtype."
1489,0.005,1.0000,"The detection of infectious immune complexes in plasma after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may be useful as a surrogate marker of progression of disease and may help in understanding the pathogenesis of AIDS. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitates of plasma were tested for the presence of HIV p24 antigen and infectious virus. Results were compared with data from cell and plasma cultures, plasma p24 antigen, CD4 cell counts, and stage of disease. PEG precipitation increased the detection rate of the p24 antigen assay from 38.3% to 58.7%. There was a significant correlation between precipitable p24 antigen and plasma viremia, changes in CD4 cell counts, and progression of disease. The sensitivity of the PEG-precipitable p24 antigen assay versus traditional p24 antigen testing was 59.0% and the specificity 91.7%. The assay was reproducible and may be a useful determinant of viral load, clinical progression, and antiretroviral efficacy."
4308,0.005,1.0000,"Poor micronutrient levels are associated with an increased risk of progression to AIDS and are also suggested to influence outcome of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), though existing data are inconclusive to support the latter. Few published data are available on micronutrient levels in Ethiopian HIV/AIDS patients taking HAART. The objective of the study was to determine the association of micronutrient levels and response to HAART (CD4(+) T cell count) among adult HIV/AIDS patients attending a teaching Hospital in Addis Ababa. CD4(+) T cell counts and micronutrient (retinol, zinc, and iron) levels for 171 subjects were determined using standard procedures. Some proportions of the study participants were found deficient for retinol (14.03 %), zinc (47.3 %), and iron (2.8 %). Patients who were deficient in retinol had a significantly lower median CD4(+) T cell counts (P = 0.002) compared to non-deficient subjects. Association of micronutrient quartiles with CD4+ T cell count was assessed using adjusted multivariate regression by taking quartile 4 as a reference category. Accordingly, patients who had retinol levels in quartile 4 had a significantly lower mean CD4(+) T cell count compared to quartile 3 (P = 0.02). The significantly higher CD4(+) T cell counts in patients who were non-deficient in retinol imply the role of retinol in improving the production of CD4(+) T cells. However, both lower and higher retinol levels were associated with suppressed immunity (CD4 < 200 cells/mm(3)), suggesting an adverse effect of higher retinol levels. Thus, retinol may be potentially harmful depending on the dose, emphasizing the need for optimized level of retinol in nutrient supplements in patients taking HAART."
7108,0.005,1.0000,"Carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs), such as the plant lectins Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA) and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA), but also the nonpeptidic antibiotic pradimicin A (PRM-A), inhibit entry of HIV into its target cells by binding to the glycans of gp120. Given the high sequence identity and similarity between the envelope gp120 glycoproteins of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), the inhibitory activity of a variety of CBAs were evaluated against HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV. There seemed to be a close correlation for the inhibitory potential of CBAs against HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV replication in cell culture and syncytia formation in cocultures of persistently SIV-infected HUT-78 cell cultures and uninfected CEM cells. CBAs also inhibit transmission of the SIV to T lymphocytes after capture of the virus by dendritic cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN)-expressing cells. A total of 8 different SIV strains were isolated after prolonged HHA, UDA, and PRM-A exposure in virus-infected cell cultures. Each virus isolate consistently contained at least 2 or 3 glycan deletions in its gp120 envelope and showed decreased sensitivity to the CBAs and cross-resistance toward all CBAs. Our data revealed that CBAs afford SIV and HIV-1 inhibition in a similar manner regarding prevention of virus infection, DC-SIGN-directed virus capture-related transmission, and selection of drug-resistant mutant virus strains. Therefore, SIV(mac251)-infected monkeys might represent a relevant animal model to study the efficacy of CBAs in vivo."
3194,0.005,1.0000,"Two hundred and two homosexual men enrolled in a prospective cohort study of AIDS risk were assessed for differences in the occurrence and progression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection with respect to cigarette smoking. Among subjects who were initially seronegative, smokers were more likely than nonsmokers to become HIV-1 seropositive (p = 0.03). After seroconversion, serum beta 2-microglobulin and CD4+ lymphocyte levels were elevated in cigarette smokers relative to nonsmokers (p = 0.02 for both comparisons), but both of these differences disappeared within 2 years. There was no detectable difference in the risk of AIDS or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with respect to smoking. Our data suggest that cigarette smoking may alter the immune response to HIV-1 infection, but it appears to have no marked effect on clinical outcome. They also suggest that cigarette smoking may be a surrogate marker for continued high-risk sexual behavior in homosexual men."
1861,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus share a similar transmission pathway and are often diagnosed in the same patient. These patients tend to have a faster progression of hepatic fibrosis. This cross-sectional study describes the demographic features and clinical profile of human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis co-infected patients in Paraná, Southern Brazil. A total of 93 human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients attending a tertiary care academic hospital in Southern Brazil were included. Clinical, demographic and epidemiological data were evaluated. Hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis C virus positive serology was found in 6.6% of patients. The anti-hepatitis C virus serum test was positive in 85% (79/93) of patients, and the infection was confirmed in 72% of the cases. Eighteen patients (19%) were human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis B virus positive (detectable HBsAg). Among co-infected patients, there was a high frequency of drug use, and investigations for the detection of co-infection were conducted late. A low number of patients were eligible for treatment and, although the response to antiretroviral therapy was good, there was a very poor response to hepatitis therapy. Our preliminary findings indicate the need for protocols aimed at systematic investigation of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, thus allowing for early detection and treatment of co-infected patients.

6823,0.005,1.0000,"We have reported that an antiserum prepared against thymosin alpha 1 [which shares a region of homology with the p17 protein of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated human immunodeficiency virus] effectively neutralized the AIDS virus and prevented its replication in H9 cells. Using HPLC and immunoblot analysis, we have identified from a clone B, type III human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-IIIB) extract a protein with a molecular weight of 17,000 that is immunoreactive with thymosin alpha 1. In contrast, no immunoreactivity was found in retroviral extracts from a number of nonhuman species including feline, bovine, simian, gibbon, and murine retroviruses. Heterologous antiserum prepared against a 30-amino acid synthetic peptide analogue (HGP-30) does not cross-react with thymosin alpha 1 but does react specifically with the p17 protein of the AIDS virus in a manner identical to that seen with an HTLV-IIIB p17-specific monoclonal antibody. The demonstration that this synthetic analogue is immunogenic and that antibodies to HGP-30 cross-react not only with the synthetic peptide but also with the HTLV-IIIB p17 viral protein provides an additional, and potentially more specific, candidate for development of a synthetic peptide vaccine for AIDS. In addition, the p17 synthetic peptide (HGP-30) may prove to be useful in a diagnostic assay for the detection of AIDS virus infection in seronegative individuals."
6349,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), formerly termed human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLVIII/LAV), is the etiological agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Direct detection of HIV-1 nucleic acid sequences in patient tissue or blood samples is possible in only a minor fraction of cases due to the low percentage of infected cells (Shaw et al., 1984). We report a modification of the polymerase chain reaction method (PCR) (Saiki et al., 1985), in which we amplify sequences from HIV-1 RNA templates, for the identification of HIV-1 in peripheral blood and tissue samples obtained from AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC) patients. This method of HIV-1 detection is at least six orders of magnitude more sensitive than standard nucleic acid detection methods and has direct clinical applications. In vitro tissue culturing of the virus is not required for HIV-1 detection. Using this technique, the sequence in the orfB region of HIV-1 has been amplified and detected from less than 1 microgram of total RNA prepared from a few milliliters of peripheral blood samples. This technique enables the rapid and unambiguous clinical detection of potential HIV-infected individuals and can be used to assay the efficacy of anti-HIV-1 drugs. To enhance the efficiency of this technique, we have appended the prokaryotic T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence to one of the priming oligonucleotides. After several cycles of PCR with the promoter-containing oligo, a small aliquot of the reaction can be utilized to direct specific and efficient T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription of the amplified sequences, thus enhancing the sensitivity and simplifying the labor of the experiment."
4700,0.005,1.0000,"We assessed the effect of different hepatic conditions such as fibrosis, steatosis and necroinflammatory activity on liver stiffness as measured by transient elastography in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. We studied all consecutive HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who underwent liver biopsy and elastography between January 2007 and December 2008. Liver fibrosis was staged following METAVIR Cooperative Study Group criteria. Steatosis was categorized according to the percentage of affected hepatocytes as low (≤10%), moderate (<25%) and severe (≥25%). A total of 110 patients were included. Fibrosis was distributed by stage as follows: F0, n = 13; F1, n = 47; F2, n = 29; F3, n = 18; and F4, n = 3. Liver biopsy revealed the presence of hepatic steatosis in 68 patients (low to moderate, n = 53; and severe n = 15). By univariate regression analysis, fibrosis, necroinflammatory activity, and the degree of steatosis were correlated with liver stiffness. However, in a multiple regression analysis, steatosis and fibrosis were the only independent variables significantly associated with liver stiffness. With a cut-off of 9.5 kPa to distinguish patients with F ≤ 2 from F ≥ 3, elastography led to a significantly higher number of misclassification errors (25%vs 5%; P = 0.014), most of which were false positives for F ≥ 3. Our study suggests that the correlation between liver stiffness and fibrosis as estimated by transient elastography may be affected by the presence of hepatic steatosis in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients."
4494,0.005,1.0000,"Several studies have demonstrated that HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients experience more rapid fibrosis progression. In this study, to estimate the annual rate of direct liver fibrosis progression, we used analyses of paired biopsy samples from HIV/HCV-coinfected patients without prior treatment of hepatitis and assessed the possible association of fibrosis progression with certain clinical variables. We evaluated 30 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, with no history of prior treatment of hepatitis C, who underwent paired liver biopsies. All patients were under antiretroviral therapy at first and second biopsies. The average annual progression rate was 0.13 fibrosis unit/year, with 36.7% of patients defined as progressors. Liver fibrosis progression was associated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT; P < .001) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST; P < .0340) levels over 3 times the upper limit of normal present at first biopsy. Elevated ALT and AST levels appear to be associated with more accelerated liver fibrosis progression among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. "
1678,0.005,1.0000,"Because V3 loop-specific antibodies have been shown to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of human cells and because specific mutations in the V3 loop render the virus ineffective for infection and syncytium formation, we tested the anti-HIV effects of V3 loop peptides from different HIV-1 strains. We obtained evidence that V3 loop synthetic peptides of 8 to 15 amino acids at nanogram concentrations efficiently blocked HIV-1 IIIB infection of several human T-cell lines and of freshly prepared normal human T cells. More importantly, syncytium formation by three different primary clinical HIV isolates was inhibited by the V3 loop peptide from HIV-1 IIIB at a concentration of 1 micrograms/ml. Concentrations of V3 peptides up to 50 micrograms/ml were not toxic to any of the human cells studied. Additionally, V3 peptides incubated in normal human serum or plasma exhibited biological and physical stability for up to 24 h. Taken together, these results suggest that the V3 loop peptides have medical utility as therapeutic reagents to either prevent HIV-1 infection in humans or reduce the spread of virus infection in HIV-infected individuals. These findings are especially significant because a number of reports in the literature indicate that the V3 loop region in gp120 plays an important role in the initial stages of HIV-1 infection of cells."
4980,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis virus B or C (HBV, HCV) transmission are major risks following infusion of coagulation factor concentrates. Thus, several methods have been used to achieve viral inactivation of concentrates prepared from plasma collected from a large number of donors. In this study, 32 patients with haemophilia A or B (n = 31) or von Willebrand's disease (n = 1) were treated between 1987 and 1990 only with factor VIII or IX concentrates inactivated by the solvent-detergent procedure. During this period, none of these cases exhibited elevated liver enzymes (alanine amino transferase), and serological tests for HIV, HBV and HCV infections always remained negative. This suggests that the solvent-detergent procedure of concentrate inactivation is an efficient method to prevent not only HIV or HBV transmission but also HCV infection in haemophiliacs."
1563,0.005,1.0000,"Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) of the B-cell type are the second most common neoplasm among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and AIDS. Here, we evaluated 48 cases of AIDS-related lymphomas (ARL) diagnosed at the Histopathological Division of the Instituto de Investigaciones Hematológicas of the National Academy of Medicine. Five were females and 43 were males with a median of age of 37 years at the time of the diagnosis. Micrometer sections were prepared and stained with hematoxilin-eosin; immunohistochemical examination for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was carried out in 48/48 cases. Additionally, biotinilated oligonucleotides were used to determine the presence of DNA of the Human Herpes virus type-8 (HHV-8) in 14/14 biopsy smears corresponding to plasmablastic lymphomas (PL). All were fenotype B cell lymphomas with an aggressive course and advanced neoplasm disease at the time of diagnosis. Virological findings showed the strong association between EBV and AIDS-related NHL. According to the histopathological subtype, the EBV genome was detected in 16/21 (76%) diffuse large B cell lymphomas, 1/3 Burkitt lymphoma and 3/4 (75%) of primary central nervous system lymphomas. Globally, EBV genome was detected in 20/28 NHL of this series. Detection of HHV-8 was negative in all cases of PL. Hodgkin lymphoma were more frequent in males 18/20 (90%), with an aggressive clinical course and a significant predominance of the subtypes associated with worse prognosis (90% of cases). We detected a significant association between EBV and HL (90% of cases). We consider that all cases of AIDS related lymphomas should be assessed for the presence of EBV because its presence may play a role in the prognosis."

Screening for HCV and HBV is performed only in high-risk groups with diagnostic tests with high sensitivity and specificity. In HCV antibody positive patients, serum HCV RNA has to be determined by quantitative assay and virus genotype identified. Liver fibrosis is determined by liver biopsy or widely accepted elastography and different serum fibrosis markers. In patients with HCV cirrhosis, HCC has to be detected by expert ultrasound performer or MSCT, MR, and liver transplantation performed according to indications. The current hepatitis B vaccination policy is universal neonatal vaccination. The risk population undergo screening for HBsAg, antiHBc and antiHBs antibodies. The HBsAg, HBeAg and antiHBe positive individuals undergo quantitative testing for HBsAg and HBV DNA. According to the stage of their liver disease, patients are treated with interferon or nucleos(t)ide analogues. The optimal treatment with oral antivirals are entecavir and tenofovir, but the duration of treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues is generally life-long. In HBV cirrhosis and HBsAg inactive carriers, detection of HCC is essential, and liver transplantation is successfully performed in these patients."

Annual AIDS cases were increasing, and their major diseases were included with the following mycosis: pneumosystis pneumonia 35.7%, candidiasis 19.1%, and cryptococcosis 2.4%. There were two foreigner's cases of histoplasmosis and no coccidioidosis. Candidiasis was likely to be shown in Japanese patients and cryptococcosis was in foreigners. Outcome of cryptococcosis was very poor as 32.7% of patients died. There were 17 HIV-related aspergillosis, which consisted of 13 cases of lung diseases, 2 of brain lesions, and one each of sinus and stomach disease. Remarkable risk factor of HIV-related aspergillosis was decrease of CD4 cell count less than 10/microl, in addition to the usual risk factors of aspergillosis. Outcome of aspergillosis was very poor, as all treated cases died except one recent case treated with voriconazole."
7493,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the importance of understanding the epidemiology of agents responsible for infectious diarrhea in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) population, the number of articles about this subject is relatively few. The current article summarizes published data on bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic enteropathogens in the HIV/AIDS seropositive subjects in different countries, regions and localities. In general, there is a great difference in the frequencies of etiological agents due to factors which include immune status, geographical location, climate and socioeconomic conditions. It is important to stress that a great prevalence of infection by emergent agents has been reported in the more advanced stages of AIDS. Therefore, to establish specific treatment depends directly on knowledge of these agents and risk factors associated to their distribution. Moreover, the colonization by potential pathogenic agents verified in these individuals is high thus implicating that they act as carriers. Finally, public health measures of control and prevention must take into consideration the regional previously identified enteropathogens, especially in areas where HIV prevalence is high."
4819,0.005,1.0000,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a widespread human pathogen and chronic HBV infection is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Some cellular microRNAs are emerging as important regulators of virus-host interaction, indirectly or directly modulating HBV replication and pathogenesis. miR-125a binds the viral transcript encoding the surface antigen and interferes with its expression, thus inhibiting viral replication. Intriguingly, liver miR-125a expression has been found increased in patients with high levels of hepatic HBV-DNA. The present study investigates the mechanism by which liver exposure to HBV induces the expression of miR-125a. The analyses were first performed on liver biopsies from HBV patients, showing that the expression of the viral transactivator X protein (HBx) paralleled the increase of miR-125a expression. Then, transfection of HCC cell lines with an HBx-expressing vector showed a substantial increase of miR-125a expression. Overall, the available data depict a self-inhibitory feedback loop in which HBV, through HBx, increases the expression of miR-125a, that in turn interferes with expression of HBV surface antigen, thus repressing viral replication.

This study group is predominantly African-American; 41% of the participants are women. The major risk factor for HIV infection is intravenous drug use. Overall, 56% of the study population had evidence of current or past infection with GBV-C. GBV-C exposure was not associated with hepatitis C virus infection. The group of participants, who had GBV-C viremia and anti-E2 antibodies, had high percentage of patients with an undetectable HIV-1 viral load.

However, the epidemiology of this condition, including frequency, severity, and duration, has not been well-characterized in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In this study, we describe the epidemiology of thrombocytopenia using two methods. We conducted a systematic review of the literature published between 1997 and 2009 to characterize the frequency of thrombocytopenia in different populations in the HAART era. Secondly, we examined the frequency, severity, and duration of thrombocytopenia among HIV patients in the Collaborations in HIV Outcomes Research/US (CHORUS) Cohort from 1997 to 2006 and among HIV patients participating in GlaxoSmithKline HIV Clinical Trials between 1996 and 2004. Prevalence estimates of thrombocytopenia (<150 000 platelets/µl) in the literature varied greatly but were generally above 10%. The thrombocytopenia prevalence estimates in the CHORUS Cohort and the HIV Clinical Trials were both 14%. In the CHORUS Cohort, the platelet count was ≤50 000/µl among 3.1% and ≤30 000/µl among 1.7%; in the HIV clinical trials database, the platelet count was ≤50 000/µl among 1.3% and ≤30 000/µl among 0.67%. Duration of severe thrombocytopenia varied greatly, with the medium duration to ≥75 000 platelets/µl taking 147 days in the CHORUS Cohort and 33 days in the HIV clinical trials database. Among 111 patients with severe thrombocytopenia in the CHORUS Cohort, 23% never achieved a higher platelet count over follow-up. In conclusion, while the prevalence of severe thrombocytopenia was low, it occurred at levels associated with bleeding and was persistent among a small proportion of patients despite receipt of HAART."
2797,0.005,1.0000,"Biphasic plasma viral decays were modeled in 48 patients treated with ritonavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. Estimated first- and second-phase decay rates were d1 as 0.47/day and d2 as 0.04/day. Interpatient differences in both decay rates were significant. The d1 was directly correlated with baseline CD4+, CD4+CD28+, and CD8+CD28+ T lymphocyte counts (P<.05) and inversely correlated with baseline virus load (P=.044) and the magnitude of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte recovery (P<.01). The d2 was directly correlated with baseline percentage of CD8+ T lymphocytes (P=.023), the CD8+CD38+ cell number (P=.024), and the level of IgG that binds to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 gp120 (P=.02). Viral decay rates were not predictive of treatment failure or durability of viral suppression. These exploratory findings are consistent with a model in which immunologic factors contribute to elimination of HIV-infected cells and suggest a dynamic interplay between regulation of HIV expression and lymphocyte activation and recovery."
6016,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of AIDS, infects and kills lymphoid cells bearing the CD4 antigen. In an infected cell, a number of cellular as well as HIV-encoded gene products determine the levels of viral gene expression and HIV replication. Efficient HIV-replication occurs in activated T cells. Utilizing transient expression assays, we show that gene expression directed by the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) increases in response to T-cell activation signals. The effects of T-cell activation and of the HIV-encoded trans-activator (TAT) are multiplicative. Analysis of mutations and deletions in the HIV LTR reveals that the region responding to T-cell activation signals is located at positions -105 to -80. These sequences are composed of two direct repeats, which are homologous to the core transcriptional enhancer elements in the simian virus 40 genome. Our studies reveal that these elements function as the HIV enhancer. By acting directly on the HIV LTR, T-cell activation may play an important role in HIV gene expression and in the activation of latent HIV."

However, many PLWHA smoke cigarettes-a well known contributor to excess morbidity and mortality. To investigate the association between smoking and mortality among PLWHA during the HAART era (1996+), we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 2,108 PLWHA enrolled in Seattle and King County's Adult and Adolescent Spectrum of HIV Disease Study. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality were obtained using Cox proportional hazards regression. Compared to never smokers, current smokers (aHR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3, 2.3) and individuals with an increased dose and/or duration of smoking were at greater risk of all-cause mortality. Although additional research is needed to evaluate the full effect of smoking on cause-specific mortality, smoking cessation programs should target PLWHA to further increase their life expectancy."

The enrolled patients have been consecutively treated with Korean red ginseng (KRG), zidovudine (ZDV) or two-drug therapy and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We determined full-length pol gene over 20 years and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I with peripheral blood mononuclear cells and reviewed medical records. Eighteen HPs experienced various opportunistic infections or clinical manifestations. There were significant inverse correlations between the HLA prognostic score and the annual decrease in CD4+ T-cell counts prior to HAART (AD) (P < 0.05) and the amount of KRG and the AD (P < 0.01). From 1998, the HPs had been treated with HAART. Each of the two patients died without and with HAART regimen respectively. At present, 16 HPs have been alive with HAART. Among the 16 HPs, 12 and 4 are on HAART-plus-KRG and HAART only respectively. Eleven HPs including 2 HPs with G-to-A hypermutations had revealed resistance mutations. Ten and two HPs have shown poor adherence and incomplete viral suppres-sion on HAART respectively. Virological failure based on WHO guidelines was not observed on KRG-plus-HAART. Two HPs revealed additional resistance mutations against two classes on KRG-plus-HAART. As a nationwide study, we first report overall features on clinical course of Korean haemophiliacs.

1992,0.005,1.0000,"We developed a mathematical model using a multiple source of infection framework to assess the potential effect of the expansion of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) coverage among those in medical need on the number of individuals testing newly positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and on related costs in British Columbia, Canada, over the next 25 years. The model was calibrated using retrospective data describing antiretroviral therapy utilization and individuals testing newly positive for HIV in the province. Different scenarios were investigated on the basis of varying assumptions regarding drug resistance, adherence to HAART, therapeutic guidelines, degree of HAART coverage, and the timing of HAART uptake. Expansion of HAART lead to substantial reductions in the growth of the HIV epidemic and related costs. These results provide powerful additional motivation to accelerate the roll out of HAART programs aggressively targeting those in medical need, both for their own benefit and as a means of decreasing new HIV infections."
2712,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 persists in peripheral blood monocytes in individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with viral suppression, despite these cells being poorly susceptible to infection in vitro. Because very few monocytes harbor HIV-1 in vivo, we considered whether a subset of monocytes might be more permissive to infection. We show that a minor CD16+ monocyte subset preferentially harbors HIV-1 in infected individuals on HAART when compared with the majority of monocytes (CD14highCD16-). We confirmed this by in vitro experiments showing that CD16+ monocytes were more susceptible to CCR5-using strains of HIV-1, a finding that is associated with higher CCR5 expression on these cells. CD16+ monocytes were also more permissive to infection with a vesicular stomatitis virus G protein-pseudotyped reporter strain of HIV-1 than the majority of monocytes, suggesting that they are better able to support HIV-1 replication after entry. Consistent with this observation, high molecular mass complexes of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) were observed in CD16+ monocytes that were similar to those observed in highly permissive T cells. In contrast, CD14highCD16- monocytes contained low molecular mass active APOBEC3G, suggesting this is a mechanism of resistance to HIV-1 infection in these cells. Collectively, these data show that CD16+ monocytes are preferentially susceptible to HIV-1 entry, more permissive for replication, and constitute a continuing source of viral persistence during HAART."

Changes of CD4+ and plasma viral load (PVL) from baseline to week 4 of vaccination were assessed in 31 randomly selected vaccinees. The incidence of pneumococcal disease and bacteremia of vaccinees was 2.1 per 1000 patient-years (PY) (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.7-2.5 per 1000 PY) over the median observation of 641 days (range, 37-832 days) following vaccination while that of non-vaccinee was 21.8 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 20.1-23.7 per 1000 PY) and 7.3 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 7.0-7.6 per 1000 PY), respectively, over the observation of 500 days (range, 32-851 days), with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for developing pneumococcal disease of 0.085 (95% CI, 0.010-0.735) and for bacteremia of 0.22 (95% CI, 0.018-2.561). The median CD4+ count increased by 45 x 10(6) l(-1) (P = 0.01) and median PVL change was 0 log(10) copies/ml (range of decrease, -0.74 to 2.47 log(10) copies/ml) after 1 month of pneumococcal vaccination among the subgroup of 31 vaccinees receiving HAART. The median CD4+ count increase from baseline to the end of study was 149 x 10(6) l(-1) for vaccinees and 107 x 10(6) l(-1) for non-vaccinees (P = 0.21). The AOR of developing all-cause community-acquired pneumonia and new AIDS-defining opportunistic illnesses (OI) of vaccinees as compared to non-vaccinees was 1.876 (95% CI, 0.785-4.485) and 0.567 (95% CI, 0.217-1.484), respectively. Death rate of vaccinees and non-vaccinees was 17.7 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 16.5-18.9 per 1000 PY) and 80.5 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 77.1-83.9 per 1000 PY), respectively. Adjusted hazard ratio for death of vaccinees as compared with non-vaccinees was 0.733 (95% CI, 0.236-2.274). Our data suggested that vaccination with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and receipt of HAART were associated with reduced risks for pneumococcal disease among HIV-1-infected patients receiving HAART. Vaccination did not increase the risks of all-cause community-acquired pneumonia, HIV progression, and mortality. Vaccination did not increase PVL or decrease CD4+ among HIV-1-infected patients receiving HAART."

The aetiology of the seizures includes opportunistic infections, neoplasia, HIV itself, metabolic derangements and drugs. Apart from treating the cause of the seizures, the challenge is to use the appropriate anticonvulsant drug (AED) to avoid potentially adverse drug-drug interactions in patients who are on concurrent highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Initial recommendations were that the newer AEDs should preferably be used because of their simpler pharmacokinetics. We report on our experience with the use sodium valproate (SV) in eight patients who were on concurrent HAART. There were two males and six females with a mean age of 34.1 years. The mean dose of SV was 1075 mg per day. Seizure control was excellent, the CD4 count improved and there was successful viral suppression in all patients. This small study showed that SV was safe and effective. It is also relatively inexpensive compared to the newer AEDs - an important consideration in resource poor settings."

In Brazil this source is implicated in infection of 15 percent of patients developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). So, we evaluated the relative risk of our patients in dialysis becoming infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus associated with the AIDS. An enzyme immunoassay showed 6 of 104 patients on dialysis to have antibodies to HIV. In five infection with HIV was confirmed by Western blot tests. Investigation of other risk factors for AIDS showed that blood transfusion was the most likely cause of contamination. There was no correlation between HIV and HBV infections. Only one patient had leucopenia and low OKT4/T8 ratio and she died 90 days after sorologic diagnosis of HIV infection; the cause of death was encephalopathy and sepsis. Two patients died after 4 and 16 months victims of cardiocirculatory problems (non-AIDS related causes). Three patients remain asymptomatic on chronic hemodialysis 20, 36 and 37 months after diagnosis of HIV infection."
1405,0.005,1.0000,"We isolated two template analog reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor-resistant mutants of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 RT by using the DNA aptamer, RT1t49. The mutations associated, N255D or N265D, displayed low-level resistance to RT1t49, while high-level resistance could be observed when both mutations were present (Dbl). Molecular clones of HIV that contained the mutations produced replication-defective virions. All three RT mutants displayed severe processivity defects. Thus, while biochemical resistance to the DNA aptamer RT1t49 can be generated in vitro via multiple mutations, the overlap between the aptamer- and template-primer-binding pockets favors mutations that also affect the RT-template-primer interaction. Therefore, viruses with such mutations are replication defective. Potent inhibition and a built-in mechanism to render aptamer-resistant viruses replication defective make this an attractive class of inhibitors."
7814,0.005,1.0000,"Viral protein R (Vpr) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a small accessory protein involved in the nuclear import of viral DNA and the growth arrest of host cells. Several studies have demonstrated that a significant amount of Vpr is incorporated into the virus particle via interaction with the p6 domain of Gag, and it is generally assumed that Vpr is packaged in equimolar ratio to Gag. We have quantitated the relative amount of Vpr in purified virions following [(35)S]cysteine labeling of infected MT-4 cells, as well as by quantitative immunoblotting and found that Vpr is present in a molar ratio of approximately 1:7 compared to capsid. Analysis of isolated core particles showed that Vpr is associated with the mature viral core, despite quantitative loss of p6 from core preparations. Metabolic labeling of infected cells with ortho[(32)P]phosphate revealed that a small fraction of Vpr is phosphorylated in virions and infected cells."

Participants (N = 95) were African American/Black and Latino adults with CD4 < 500 cells/mm(3) not taking ART, randomized 1:1 to intervention or control arms, the latter receiving treatment as usual. Primary endpoints were adherence, evaluated via ART concentrations in hair samples, and HIV viral load suppression. The intervention was feasible and acceptable. Eight months post-baseline, intervention participants tended to be more likely to evidence ""good"" (that is, 7 days/week) adherence (60 vs. 26.7 %; p = 0.087; OR = 3.95), and had lower viral load levels than controls (t(22) = 2.29, p = 0.032; OR = 5.20), both large effect sizes.

4586,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C viruses with different coreceptor usage profiles were isolated from 29 South African patients with advanced AIDS. All 24 R5 isolates were inhibited by the CCR5-specific agents, PRO 140 and RANTES, while the two X4 viruses and the three R5X4 viruses were sensitive to the CXCR4-specific inhibitor, AMD3100. The five X4 or R5X4 viruses were all able to replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells that did not express CCR5. When tested using coreceptor-transfected cell lines, one R5 virus was also able to use CXCR6, and another R5X4 virus could use CCR3, BOB/GPR15, and CXCR6. The R5X4 and X4 viruses contained more-diverse V3 loop sequences, with a higher overall positive charge, than the R5 viruses. Hence, some HIV-1 subtype C viruses are able to use CCR5, CXCR4, or both CXCR4 and CCR5 for entry, and they are sensitive to specific inhibitors of entry via these coreceptors. These observations are relevant to understanding the rapid spread of HIV-1 subtype C in the developing world and to the design of intervention and treatment strategies."
7220,0.005,1.0000,"The development of multidrug-resistant viruses compromises the efficacy of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) therapy and limits treatment options. Therefore, new targets that can be used to develop novel antiviral agents need to be identified. One such target is the interaction between Vpr, one of the accessory gene products of HIV-1 and Importin alpha, which is crucial, not only for the nuclear import of Vpr, but also for HIV-1 replication in macrophages. We have identified a potential parent compound, hematoxylin, which suppresses Vpr-Importin alpha interaction, thereby inhibiting HIV-1 replication in a Vpr-dependent manner. Analysis by real-time PCR demonstrated that hematoxylin specifically inhibited nuclear import step of pre-integration complex. Thus, hematoxylin is a new anti-HIV-1 inhibitor that targets the nuclear import of HIV-1 via the Vpr-Importin alpha interaction, suggesting that a specific inhibitor of the interaction between viral protein and the cellular factor may provide a new strategy for HIV-1 therapy."
735,0.005,1.0000,"Activation of T-cell hybridomas, preactivated normal T cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals results in apoptosis. In the first two cases, apoptosis is caused by the upregulation of Fas ligand (FasL) and its subsequent interaction with Fas; the mechanism for the spontaneous and activation-induced death of lymph node cells and PBL from HIV+ blood is not known. A number of protease inhibitors have been shown to prevent T-cell apoptosis under all of these circumstances, but the mechanism of action has not been determined. Here we show that the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d prevent activation-induced T hybridoma cell death by inhibiting the upregulation of FasL. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated that mRNA for FasL is expressed at low levels in fresh PBL from HIV-infected blood, but increases in cultured PBL from both uninfected and HIV-infected donors. The ex vivo apoptosis of PBL from HIV+ donors was prevented by adding the soluble extracellular domain of Fas, demonstrating a requisite role for Fas/ FasL interactions in this form of cell death. Furthermore, while having no effect on the death of PBL from HIV-infected blood stimulated directly via Fas, E64d inhibited FasL upregulation. Thus, aberrant apoptosis of cultured PBL from HIV-infected individuals is mediated by FasL and Fas, and E64d blocks this apoptosis by inhibiting the upregulation of FasL. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the abnormal expression of Fas and the inducible expression of FasL, contributes to the immunodeficiency of patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and suggest that modulation of FasL expression could be an effective target for therapeutic intervention."

While, how the co-infection of P. marneffei exacerbate deterioration of the immune response remains poorly understood. Here we isolated P. marneffei from the cutaneous lesions of AIDS patients and analyzed its effects on HIV-1-dendritic cells (DCs) interaction. We demonstrated that the monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) could be activated by both thermally dimorphic forms of P. marneffei for significantly promoting HIV-1 trans-infection of CD4(+) T cells, while these activated MDDCs were refractory to HIV-1 infection. Mechanistically, P. marneffei-activated MDDCs endocytosed large amounts of HIV-1 and sequestrated the internalized viruses into tetrapasnin CD81(+) compartments potentially for proteolysis escaping. The activated MDDCs increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and facilitated the formation of DC-T-cell conjunctions, where much more viruses were recruited. Moreover, we found that P. marneffei-stimulated MDDCs efficiently activated resting CD4(+) T cells and induced more susceptible targets for viral infection. Our findings demonstrate that DC function and its interaction with HIV-1 have been modulated by opportunistic pathogens such as P. marneffei for viral dissemination and infection amplification, highlighting the importance of understanding DC-HIV-1 interaction for viral immunopathogenesis elucidation."
1025,0.005,1.0000,"Enigmatic mechanisms restore the resting state in activated lymphocytes following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, rarely allowing persistent nonproductive infection. We detail a mechanism whereby cellular factors could establish virological latency. The transcription factors YY1 and LSF cooperate in repression of transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). LSF recruits YY1 to the LTR via the zinc fingers of YY1. The first two zinc fingers were observed to be sufficient for this interaction in vitro. A mutant of LSF incapable of binding DNA blocked repression. Like other transcriptional repressors, YY1 can function via recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC). We find that HDAC1 copurifies with the LTR-binding YY1-LSF repressor complex, the domain of YY1 that interacts with HDAC1 is required to repress the HIV-1 promoter, expression of HDAC1 augments repression of the LTR by YY1, and the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A blocks repression mediated by YY1. This novel link between HDAC recruitment and inhibition of HIV-1 expression by YY1 and LSF, in the natural context of a viral promoter integrated into chromosomal DNA, is the first demonstration of a molecular mechanism of repression of HIV-1. YY1 and LSF may establish transcriptional and virological latency of HIV, a state that has recently been recognized in vivo and has significant implications for the long-term treatment of AIDS."

To explore potential biomarkers for HCC, iTRAQ coupled with mass spectrometry was used to analyze proteins in plasma from individuals with HBV-associated HCC, nonmalignant cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B, and healthy individuals. Twenty-one aberrantly expressed proteins were identified from HCC patients as compared with nontumor controls. Overexpression of von Willebrand factor (vWF) was confirmed by Western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis from liver biopsies and ELISA from plasma samples revealed a correlation between vWF expression and HCC clinicopathologic staging. Furthermore, siRNA-induced vWF silencing reduced HBV replication by over two-fold via the interferon-signaling pathway and impaired the invasion and migration of HCC cells in vitro. These results indicate that vWF can serve as a biomarker, and perhaps an alternative target for therapeutic intervention of HCC progression and HBV viral infection."

Renal tissues from all 15 AAN patients showed positive staining for the incognitus strain mycoplasmal antigens within glomerular endothelial and epithelial cells, glomerular basement membrane, tubular epithelial cells and casts, and mononuclear interstitial cells. Ultrastructural study of these 15 cases revealed mycoplasma-like structures in various locations including glomerular epithelial and endothelial cells, glomerular basement membrane, tubular epithelial cells and casts, and mononuclear interstitial cells. In a parallel study, renal tissues from 15 patients with AIDS with essentially normal renal histology or mild interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration (group B) were also examined. These tissues showed no evidence of incognitus strain mycoplasmal infection in renal parenchymal cells; however, occasional scattered mononuclear interstitial cells were positive for the antigens of this organism. Renal tissues from five patients dying with non-AIDS diseases (group C) showed no staining for the incognitus strain antigens in any location. Therefore, infection of renal parenchymal cells by M fermentans (incognitus strain) in the kidneys of AIDS patients is apparently associated with AAN."

HIV-1-infected cells were cultured in the presence of test compounds, and drug effects on p24 core antigen production were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with the molecularly cloned clinical isolate HIV-1JRCSF, the 50% effective concentrations for U-90152, AZT, and ddC were 5.3, 5.9, and 25.0 nM, respectively. Over a range of drug concentrations (U-90152 and AZT at 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 nM; ddC at 3, 10, 30, and 100 nM), U-90152 in combination with AZT or ddC synergistically inhibited the replication of a laboratory-adapted strain and a clinical isolate of HIV-1."

Infection with HIV-1 leads to progressive compromise of the immune system, resulting in infections with opportunistic pathogens and eventual death. Experiments were designed to determine if in vitro HIV-1 infection of mononuclear phagocytes would diminish their oxidative capabilities, thus decreasing their antimicrobial effectiveness. Blood monocytes and peritoneal macrophages were obtained from uninfected donors and inoculated with a monocytotropic strain of HIV-1. Hydrogen peroxide production and reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium were measured after acute stimulation of cells with PMA or a phagocytic stimulus. Despite vigorous virus production, no difference was seen in oxidative burst between uninfected cells and infected cells or between monocyte-derived and peritoneal macrophages. In conclusion, reduced antimicrobial activity of HIV-infected mononuclear phagocytes is probably not secondary to decreased ability to generate reactive oxygen species."
1340,0.005,1.0000,"To define the relationship between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in hematopoietic stem cells and virus production by their progeny, we performed kinetic studies infecting bone marrow (BM) stem cells and culturing them in the presence of hematopoietic growth factors. CD34-positive (CD34+), CD4-negative (CD4-) BM cells were isolated and infected in vitro with the monocytotropic HIV-1JR-FL strain or the laboratory-maintained HTLV-IIIB strain at a high multiplicity of infection. The cells were susceptible to productive infection only with HIV-1JR-FL, and virus production as measured by p24 protein release was markedly increased (more than fivefold) in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3). Macrophage CSF (M-CSF) was less stimulatory and granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) had no effect on virus production. Virus production coincided with proliferation of mononuclear phagocytes but was not related to granulocytic proliferation in G-CSF-treated BM cultures. Although peak virus production from GM-CSF-treated macrophages occurred 2 to 3 weeks after infection, peak virus production in infected stem cells was observed 5 to 6 weeks after. Enhancement in virus production had a more rapid onset when CD34+/CD4- cells were cultured in the presence of both GM-CSF and IL-3 for 7 or 14 days. Under these conditions there was a 10-fold enhancement in virus production after 7 days of preincubation and a 50-fold enhancement after 14 days. These data indicate that while the stem cell compartment may be susceptible to infection with a monocytotropic HIV-1 strain, productive and sustained infection is realized only after macrophage differentiation. The lack of effect of G-CSF on virus production is likely because of the limited effect of this hematopoietin on mononuclear phagocyte generation and function."
6570,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation during immunosuppressive therapy is common in patients with solid tumor or hematological malignancies. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to hepatitis flare and/or hepatic decompensation. These consequences arising from HBV reactivation are, however, largely preventable. Routine screening for HBV serologic status is recommended for all cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or biologics. By recognizing different serological patterns (which represent either overt or occult HBV infection) and the types of immunosuppressive therapies prescribed, a risk-adapted approach can be established. Prophylactic therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues (prior to or concomitantly with the commencement of immunosuppressive therapies) is more effective than pre-emptive therapy (starting antiviral when HBV DNA level is rising) in high-risk individuals. Entecavir has been proven to be more effective than lamivudine according to recent studies. Close monitoring of serum HBV level is the preferred strategy in low-risk patients. However, the optimal interval of DNA monitoring and the duration of therapy remain unknown. "

In 50 normal samples, cystatin C concentration was 1247 +/- 224 micrograms/L (mean +/- SD) which is in agreement with previously reported levels. Serum levels of cystatin C and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-M) were investigated in a time-course study during the development of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We found a persistent and uniform increase in the beta 2-M concentration (2762 +/- 1239 micrograms/L). In contrast to beta 2-M, on the basis of cystatin C levels, we found two distinct populations, one of which demonstrated an increased concentration (1620 +/- 618 micrograms/L). Interestingly a second group (21% of patients) exhibited an initial significant decrease in cystatin C concentration with a mean value of 377 (range 55-850) micrograms/L, followed by an increase. The biphasic pattern of cystatin C serum, a major cysteine proteinase inhibitor, during the course of HIV infection suggests a possible role for these proteinases (or proteinase inhibitors) in the development of this syndrome."

6569,0.005,1.0000,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is predominantly a hepatotropic virus but also infects cells of the lymphatic system. HBV genomes (DNA, messenger (m)RNA, covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA) and proteins have been found in extrahepatic sites such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid. HBV entry into hepatocytes occurs by binding of the HBV preS1 surface protein to its specific receptor, the bile acid transporter, sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP). Although the mechanism of HBV entry into lymphatic cells is unknown, the pre S1 encoded surface protein is thought to be involved. Extrahepatic HBV infection has been studied in both chronic HBV (CHB) and in occult HBV infection (OBI). Studies have shown that HBV genomes are present in different PBMC subsets from chronically infected carriers. Unique HBV variants have been found in PBMC compared to plasma or liver in both nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) treated and untreated CHB carriers, suggesting replication and compartment specific evolution of HBV. In HBV coinfection, HBV genomes were found in PBMC from hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) co-infected individuals. Moreover, during pregnancy, the trans placental passage of HBV infected PBMC from highly viremic mothers to infants is one of the postulated means of vertical transmission of HBV. Taken together, HBV infection in extrahepatic sites (i.e., PBMC) is implicated in multiple facets of HBV pathogenesis such as persistence, viral evolution and vertical transmission."

4664,0.005,1.0000,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic has become a major global public health problem with rising number of cases and associated deaths. Most of the present activities in developing countries, especially in Africa, are aimed at reducing the transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Care for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is essential not only to mitigate the impacts of HIV/AIDS among PLWHA but is also an important component of prevention of the disease. There is now a general recognition that comprehensive care across the continuum should be provided to PLWHA through all the stages of infection, with a crucial role for community-home based care activities. In addition, AIDS orphans need to be supported Although, documented evidences abound on the utility of comprehensive care and community-home based care approaches outside Africa and in some African countries, there is little information on them in Nigeria. This paper therefore reviews the recent epidemiology of HIV infection, the many currently developed initiatives to deliver comprehensive care for PLWHA in the hospital, community and at home, and the issue of AIDS orphans. In addition, measures to effectively integrate them into the mainstream of societal activities are discussed."

2203,0.005,1.0000,"Lymph nodes obtained from 14 macaques sacrificed at early time points following experimental inoculation with simian immunodeficiency virus were analyzed by in situ hybridization for virus load and virus cellular tropism. The lymph nodes presented a remarkably high viral load during the early phase of infection, as viral RNA was detected in as many as 2% of lymph node cells 1 week after inoculation. At this stage, macrophages and T4 lymphocytes were identified by combined immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization as the target cells of the virus. Simian immunodeficiency virus-positive macrophages concentrated in the subcapsular sinuses, suggesting an entry of infected cells via the afferent lymphatics. A shift in the pattern of viral infection was observed at 2 weeks after inoculation, with a concentration of viral RNA in the germinal centers of the developing lymphoid follicles. Follicular dendritic cells were found to be the major target of the virus at this stage. Follicular dendritic cells were associated with high levels of viral RNA but little or no detectable viral DNA, suggesting that the virus was present mostly in the form of viral particles trapped at the cell surface. Follicular dendritic cell-associated virus persisted at high levels for 2 months before subsiding, indicating that follicular dendritic cells constituted a major reservoir of the virus during the early stages of simian immunodeficiency virus infection."
6928,0.005,1.0000,"The authors examined sexual behaviors, the seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and condom use among 2,314 homosexual and bisexual men tested during 1988-1989 at the AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) National Center in Mexico City. Bisexuals constituted 24% of the sample; the seroprevalence rate was lower for bisexuals than homosexuals (21 vs. 34%). In logistic regressions, HIV-1 seropositivity was independently related to age, education, pattern of insertive/receptive behavior in anal sex, lifetime number of male sex partners, having sex with someone with AIDS, homosexual versus bisexual behavior, and a history of condyloma. The same logistic regressions were found to fit bisexuals and homosexuals. The rate of HIV-1 was reduced in individuals who indicated always requiring their partners to use a condom when practicing receptive anal sex (1% of the total). The most common practice for both homosexuals and bisexuals was ""mixed"" behavior (i.e., both insertive and receptive anal sex); this was also the practice with the highest risk. Bisexuals practiced both vaginal and anal sex with women and reported little condom use. The substantial seroprevalence among bisexuals, their frequent sexual contact with women, and their low rate of condom use imply a continuing role as a bridge of infection to females. Whether this risk will lead to a sustained heterosexual epidemic remains to be determined."
4767,0.005,1.0000,"Using a urinary immunoassay to measure aflatoxin metabolites, we examined the associations between exposure to aflatoxin, chronic infection with the hepatitis-B virus (HBV) and background rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mortality in a cross-sectional survey of 250 residents from 8 areas of Taiwan with a 4-fold variation in age-adjusted HCC mortality. Specimens of fasting blood and overnight urines were used to determine HBV carrier status and excretion of aflatoxin in the subjects surveyed. While the prevalence of hepatitis-B virus carriers showed moderate variability, there was a 500-fold range in urinary aflatoxin levels. Mean log-transformed levels of aflatoxin metabolites were similar in males and females and in HBV carriers and non-carriers. In the 8 townships, HCC mortality correlated positively with both area HBV carrier prevalence and mean aflatoxin levels. The primary analyses, however, were conducted at the individual level. Each subject's aflatoxin level was treated as the response variable in a multiple regression model, and the corresponding sex-specific area HCC rate was included as a predictor along with the individual's carrier status, age and sex; alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking were also considered. In these analyses, a significant association was again observed between the marker of aflatoxin exposure and the background rate of HCC mortality. In females, the slope of the regression line was somewhat steeper in HBV carriers, but this pattern was not seen in males and formal testing yielded no statistically significant evidence of an interaction. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that aflatoxin plays an independent role in hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan."
2917,0.005,1.0000,"Previous reports from India have been limited to the incidences of hepatitis B antigen (HB Ag) in health and disease. This paper reports on a study undertaken over the last two years to determine the incidence of hepatitis B virus infection, the serotypes prevalent among apparently healthy individuals and patients with liver diseases, and the seasonal incidence of sporadic acute hepatitis in this geographic area. The incidences of infection in health and disease show an endemic pattern. The Y subtype predominates among healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver diseases, whereas the D subtype predominates in patients with acute hepatitis. The similarity of subtypes of HB Ag among the majority of healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver diseases suggests that the majority of asymptomatic carriers (subclinically infected) would develop chronic liver disease. The proportion of HB Ag-positive cases of acute hepatitis was significantly higher during the two summer seasons than during the two winter seasons; this could be due to more frequent transmission of the virus by the faecal/urinary-oral route and its activation during the summer months, especially in areas with poor hygienic conditions. The urinary/faecal excretion of virus could thus maintain the natural transmission of the virus in such an environment."
3356,0.005,1.0000,"Population-based disease registries for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and cancer were linked for San Francisco residents to study the pattern of AIDS-associated malignancies diagnosed during the time period 1980-1987. A total of 1,756 newly diagnosed malignancies were identified during these years among members of the AIDS cohort. Of these, 1,752 (99.7%) occurred in males, 1,454 (83%) were Kaposi's sarcoma, 235 (13%) were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 16 (1%) were Hodgkin's disease. The distributions of AIDS patients with cancer differed significantly from those without cancer by race and by risk group. Malignancies known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated, and now diagnostic of AIDS (Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), were, as would be expected, dramatically in excess among AIDS patients. Some malignancies not traditionally thought to be HIV-associated appear to have occurred more often than expected in the study cohort. These include Hodgkin's disease, rare non-melanoma skin cancers, and cancers of the rectum, anus, and nasal cavity. Malignancies known to be HIV-associated were more likely to be diagnosed concurrent with or subsequent to first AIDS diagnosis. Conversely, malignancies not known to be HIV-associated were more likely to be diagnosed before AIDS diagnosis. Compared with the concurrent reference population of the San Francisco Bay Area, there was little or no increase in Kaposi's sarcoma over the time interval of this study. For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and suggestively for Hodgkin's disease, however, the temporal increase has been quite dramatic."
8785,0.005,1.0000,"The emergence of human immunodeficiency virus resistant to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT) in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex has been documented. Isolates from non-AZT-treated persons or those who had received AZT for less than six months showed a narrow range of susceptibility to the drug; on the other hand, isolates from those who had received AZT for six months or more consistently showed reduced susceptibility. Five highly AZT-resistant isolates were also insensitive to other compounds containing a 3'-azido group. No cross-resistance was found to other nucleoside analogues, including 2',3'-dideoxycytidine and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine. That cross-resistance occurred only in compounds containing a 3'-azido group suggests that mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene prohibit the enzyme from using nucleoside triphosphate containing a 3'-azido group. Progressive, stepwise increases in resistance have been associated with the sequential accumulation of specific amino acid changes in the reverse transcriptase gene. It is not yet known whether the resistant phenotype as determined in vitro results in clinical resistance to AZT. The gradual appearance of resistant isolates, the variable course of human immunodeficiency virus infections, and the absence of a consistent pattern of resurgent p24 antigen will make the emergence of AZT resistance difficult to correlate with clinical status or other markers. The combination of AZT with other drugs that do not share cross-resistance is a promising area for investigation to identify regimens that are more active and less likely to induce resistance."
3231,0.005,1.0000,"Host genetic factors and environment factors including hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype are widely viewed as common basis of the different outcomes of HBV infection. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) plays an important role in immunological reaction to HBV infection. The study aimed to explore whether the HLA-DQB1 allele polymorphisms are associated with the outcomes of HBV infection in the Chinese Han population. One hundred and thirty-four asymptomatic HBV carriers and 139 chronic hepatitis B patients were recruited in this case-control study in Beijing, China. Sequence-specific primers-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect 13 alleles of HLA-DQB1 gene. The frequency distributions of alleles in two groups were analysed using sas 9.1.2 software. After adjustment of confounders the frequencies of HLA-DQB1*0503 allele and *0303 allele in chronic hepatitis B group were statistically significant lower than those in asymptomatic HBV carrier group (P = 0.04; P = 0.05), and the frequency of exposure to alcohol consumption in patients with chronic hepatitis B was clearly higher than that in asymptomatic HBV carrier group (P = 0.004). HLA-DQB1*0503 allele and *0303 allele are independently resistant genetic factors to chronic hepatitis B, and alcohol consumption is the risk factor of chronic hepatitis B."
1654,0.005,1.0000,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal disorder in women of reproductive age, especially among women with HIV-1 infection. Several bacterial products including lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoteichoic acids (LTA), and peptidoglycans (PGN) are stimulatory ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and recent evidence indicates the important role of variation in TLR genes for permitting overgrowth of gram negative and BV-type flora. We assessed whether genetic polymorphisms in five TLR genes (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, and TLR9) could be determinants of differential host immune responses to BV in 159 HIV-1-positive African American adolescents enrolled in the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) study. BV was assessed biannually and diagnosed either by a Nugent score of at least 7 of 10, or using the Amsel criteria. Cox-proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for concurrent Chlamydia and Gonorrhea infections, douching, and absolute CD4 cell count, were used to identify host genetic factors associated with BV. Two SNPs were associated with BV as diagnosed by the Nugent score and the combined criteria: a minor allele G of rs4986790 (frequency=0.07), which encodes a His to Tyr substitution in TLR4 (HR=1.47, 95% CI 1.15-1.87) and rs187084 (frequency=0.24) on TLR9. The minor allele of rs1898830 (frequency=0.13) was associated with an increased hazard of BV defined by the Amsel criteria (HR=1.86, 95% CI 1.17-2.95). Further studies are warranted to confirm the associations of TLR gene variants and also to understand the underlying pathways and immunogenetic correlates in the context of HIV-1 infection."
1586,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resistance to antiretroviral drugs is the main cause of patient treatment failure. Despite the problems associated with interpretation of HIV-1 resistance testing, resistance monitoring should help in the rational design of initial or rescue antiretroviral therapies. It has previously been shown that the activity of the HIV-1 protease can be monitored by using a bacteriophage lambda-based genetic assay. This genetic screening system is based on the bacteriophage lambda regulatory circuit in which the viral repressor cI is specifically cleaved to initiate the lysogenic to lytic switch. We have adapted this simple lambda-based genetic assay for the analysis of the activities and phenotypes of different HIV-1 proteases. Lambda phages that encode HIV-1 proteases either from laboratory strains (strain HXB2) or from clinical samples are inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the HIV-1 protease inhibitors indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and nelfinavir. Distinct susceptibilities to different drugs were also detected among phages that encode HIV-1 proteases carrying different resistance mutations, further demonstrating the specificity of this assay. Differences in proteolytic processing activity can also be directly monitored with this genetic screen system since two phage populations compete in culture with each other until one phage outgrows the other. In summary, we present here a simple, safe, and rapid genetic screening system that may be used to predict the activities and phenotypes of HIV-1 proteases in the course of viral infection and antiretroviral therapy. This assay responds appropriately to well-known HIV-1 protease inhibitors and can be used to search for new protease inhibitors."
5169,0.005,1.0000,"The ideal time to initiate antiretroviral therapy in asymptomatic patients with chronic HIV infection remains to be defined. The most relevant laboratory parameter is the CD4 cell count. Therapy should be started before the CD4 cells drop below 200/microliter and the immune system becomes compromised. In contrast to past recommendations, viral load should not be used as a single laboratory parameter for initiation of antiretroviral therapy in asymptomatic untreated patients. The determination of genetic factors to assess the prognosis of HIV patients has not yet been incorporated into daily clinical practice. While co-infection with GBV-C is a prognostically favorable factor for the course of the HIV infection, replicative hepatitis C is associated with increased mortality."

The Langerin protein, found at the surface of Langerhans cells, has an important protective role in HIV-1 infection. Differences in Langerin function due to host genetic factors could influence susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. To verify the frequency of mutations in the Langerin gene, 118 samples from HIV-1-infected women and 99 samples from HIV-1-uninfected individuals were selected for sequencing of the promoter and carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD)-encoding regions of the Langerin gene. Langerin promoter analysis revealed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one mutation in both studied groups, which created new binding sites for certain transcription factors, such as NFAT5, HOXB9.01 and STAT6.01, according to MatInspector software analysis. Three SNPs were observed in the CRD-encoding region in HIV-1-infected and uninfected individuals: p.K313I, c.941C>T and c.983C>T. This study shows that mutations in the Langerin gene are present in the analysed populations at different genotypic and allelic frequencies. Further studies should be conducted to verify the role of these mutations in HIV-1 susceptibility. "

Atypical mycobacterial skeletal infections are a manifestation of advanced HIV disease, with most cases having CD4 counts < 100/mm3 at the time these infections become clinically apparent. Multiple sites are frequently involved, and concomitant skin infection with the same organism is common, especially with Mycobacterium haemophilum. The incidence of atypical mycobacterial skeletal infection in HIV-infected individuals was significantly higher than in the general county hospital district patient population, whereas the frequency of Myobacterium tuberculosis skeletal infection did not differ significantly between the two populations. The clinician therefore should maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical mycobacteria in a patient presenting with skeletal infection in the setting of a markedly depressed CD4 count."

Cervical cancer was used as a surveillance indicator for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) before definitive identification of the viral etiology of either condition were known. Careful epidemiologic studies combined with clinical and laboratory measures of HPV, HPV-associated disease, and HIV have helped us understand many aspects of the relationship between these two virus groups; however, questions remain. The histopathology associated with HPV is identical in HIV-positive and negative patients though the lesions are more frequent, with higher frequency of multiple HPV types, and persistent in HIV infected individuals.

However, the A1896 mutation is restricted to HBV isolates that have T at nt 1858.

110,0.005,1.0000,"A variant of hepatitis B virus (HBV) having a specific mutation within the S gene has been found to infect vaccinees. To know whether similar variants were involved in Japan, we analyzed two cases of maternal transmission of HBV in infants immunized with hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine. DNA clones of HBV S genes were propagated from patients and family members and sequenced. In one family, the DNA clones from the baby patient had a Gly-to-Arg mutation at the 145th codon of the S gene, whereas those from her mother had no such mutations. In the other family, all the DNA clones obtained from the two infected children had the 145th codon intact, but they had a missense mutation at the 126th codon of the S gene, causing an amino acid substitution of Asn for Thr or Ile. This same mutation was observed in 12 of 17 clones of DNA obtained from their mother. In comparison with the wild type HBV-derived hepatitis B surface antigen, the two types of S gene mutations, either at the 145th or the 126th codon, were associated with a significant decrease in the antigenicity of some determinants on the hepatitis B surface antigen, measured by MAb. Amino acid substitution at these sites, therefore, would have induced the escape from conventional vaccines that were S gene products of wild type HBV and also from hepatitis B immune globulin, whose main components were probably also antibodies against the S gene products expressed by wild type HBV."

This study was designed to detect hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome-wide mutation profiling with detailed variant composition in individual patients, especially quasispecies evolution correlating with liver disease progression. We characterized viral populations by massively parallel pyrosequencing at whole HBV genome level in 17 patients with advanced liver disease (ALD) and 30 chronic carriers (CC). An average sequencing coverage of 2047× and 687× in ALD and CC groups, respectively, were achieved. Deep sequencing data resolved the landscapes of HBV substitutions and a more complicated quasispecies composition than previously observed. The values of substitution frequencies in quasispecies were clustered as either more than 80% or less than 20%, forming a unique U-shaped distribution pattern in both clinical groups. Furthermore, quantitative comparison of mutation frequencies of each site between two groups resulted in a spectrum of substitutions associated with liver disease progression, and among which, C2288A/T, C2304A, and A/G2525C/T were novel candidates. Moreover, distinct deletion patterns in preS, X, and C regions were shown between the two groups. In conclusion, pyrosequencing of the whole HBV genome revealed a panorama of viral quasispecies composition, characteristics of substitution distribution, and mutations correlating to severe liver disease.

9201,0.005,1.0000,"Mutations in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) core gene may influence disease activity by altering immune recognition sites or level of virus replication. Sera from 69 Chinese patients with chronic HBV infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction amplification of HBV DNA to determine the frequency and location of naturally occurring HBV core gene mutations. All but one patient had nucleotide changes, and 44 (64%) patients had at least one amino acid change (mean, 3.7; range, 1-13) when compared with published sequences. Multiple regression analysis showed that the frequency of core gene mutations was significantly associated with precore stop-codon mutation, hepatitis B e antigen negativity, and active liver disease, but not patients' age. The mean number of amino acid changes/patient for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients with elevated versus normal aminotransferase levels were, respectively, 2.8 +/- 0.4 and 0.6 +/- 0.2. The corresponding values for HBeAg-negative patients were, respectively, 5.0 +/- 1.2 and 6.0 +/- 1.5. Thirteen patients were serially studied, the mean rates of amino acid substitution in HBeAg-positive patients who did or did not clear HBeAg during follow-up were 5.7 +/- 0.8 and 0 per codon/yr. Most of the mutations were clustered in the codon/yr. Most of the mutations were clustered in the middle of the core gene that harbor several major B- and helper T-cell epitopes. Very few mutations were found in the C-terminal part of the core gene. In summary, mutations in the core gene can be frequently detected in patients with chronic HBV infection. These mutations occur predominantly around the time of HBeAg clearance when liver disease is most active."
2430,0.005,1.0000,"As thymocyte infection may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for CD4+ T lymphocyte depletion in HIV-1-infected individuals, we studied the occurrence of HIV-1 infection in the thymus in vivo. Thymus (THYPD) and peripheral blood (PBLPD) primary viral isolates were obtained from an HIV-1-infected patient; restriction pattern analysis revealed the presence of a viral variant (THY) in the thymus isolate, from which biological viral clones containing this variant were obtained by limiting dilution infection of Molt-3 cells. The biological phenotype of the viral isolates and THY clones was studied in different cell lines and primary cultures. PBLPD, THYPD, and THY clones could efficiently infect T cell lines; the thymic variant showed a higher cytopathic activity in T cell lines, and a higher replication capacity in both unfractionated and CD4+CD8(+)-enriched primary thymocytes. Sequence analysis of the viral population patterns in vivo confirmed the presence of the THY variant in the thymic compartment, and revealed that the degree of V3 loop heterogeneity was higher in the thymocytes of the patient than in the peripheral blood lymphocytes. In addition to confirming thymocyte infection in vivo, our data also indicate that a differential distribution of viral variants may occur among different body compartments in a single individual; the emergence of cytopathic and tissue-specific variants in the thymus may play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease."
8010,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evades CD8(+) T-cell responses through mutations within targeted epitopes, but little is known regarding its ability to generate de novo CD8(+) T-cell responses to such mutants. Here we examined gamma interferon-positive, HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses and autologous viral sequences in an HIV-1-infected individual for more than 6 years following acute infection. Fourteen optimal HIV-1 T-cell epitopes were targeted by CD8(+) T cells, four of which underwent mutation associated with dramatic loss of the original CD8(+) response. However, following the G(357)S escape in the HLA-A11-restricted Gag(349-359) epitope and the decline of wild-type-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses, a novel CD8(+) T-cell response equal in magnitude to the original response was generated against the variant epitope. CD8(+) T cells targeting the variant epitope did not exhibit cross-reactivity against the wild-type epitope but rather utilized a distinct T-cell receptor Vbeta repertoire. Additional studies of chronically HIV-1-infected individuals expressing HLA-A11 demonstrated that the majority of the subjects targeted the G(357)S escape variant of the Gag(349-359) epitope, while the wild-type consensus sequence was significantly less frequently recognized. These data demonstrate that de novo responses against escape variants of CD8(+) T-cell epitopes can be generated in chronic HIV-1 infection and provide the rationale for developing vaccines to induce CD8(+) T-cell responses directed against both the wild-type and variant forms of CD8 epitopes to prevent the emergence of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte escape variants."
410,0.005,1.0000,"Two novel assays, a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay and an assay based on the 5'-nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase, were developed for screening viral variants in lamivudine-treated patients' sera containing <1,000 copies of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome per ml. Both assays were designed to detect single-nucleotide changes within the HBV DNA polymerase gene that are associated with lamivudine resistance in vitro and have been used to screen a number of patients' sera for variant virus. Results obtained with these assays and standard sequencing technology were compared with regard to throughput, ability to detect individual virus species present at low concentrations, and ability to detect, distinguish, and quantitate wild-type (wt) and HBV tyrosine methionine(552) aspartate aspartate motif variants in mixed viral populations. Unlike DNA sequencing, both assays are amenable to high-throughput screening and were shown to be able to quantitatively detect variant virus in the presence of a background of wt virus. As with DNA sequencing, both new assays incorporate a PCR amplification step and are able to detect the relatively low amounts of virus found in lamivudine-treated patients' sera. However, these assays are far less labor intensive than the DNA-sequencing techniques presently in use. Overall, the RFLP assay was more sensitive than DNA sequencing in detecting and determining the ratios of wt to variant virus. Furthermore, the RFLP assay and 5'-nuclease assay were equally sensitive in the detection of mixed viral species, but the RFLP assay was superior to the 5'-nuclease assay in the quantitation of mixed viral species. These assays should prove useful for further understanding of virological response to therapy and disease progression."
5894,0.005,1.0000,"Approximately 1 million people are infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Malawi. Despite efforts aimed at changing individual risk behaviors, HIV prevalence continues to rise among rural populations. Both previous research and the Political Economy of Health framework suggest that community-based socio-economic factors and accessibility may influence HIV transmission; however, these community factors have received little empirical investigation. To fill this gap, this research uses data from a nationally representative probability sample of rural Malawians combined with small area estimates of community socio-economic and accessibility data in logistic regression models to: 1) reveal relationships between community factors and individual HIV status; 2) determine whether these relationships operate through individual HIV risk behaviors; and 3) explore whether these associations vary by gender. Community socio-economic factors include relative and absolute poverty; community accessibility factors include distance to roads, cities, and public health facilities. Individual HIV risk behaviors include reported condom use, sexually transmitted infections, multiple partnerships, and paid sex. Results show that higher community income inequality, community proximity to a major road, and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV for women. For men, community proximity to a major road and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV infection. These direct relationships between community factors and individual HIV status are not mediated by individual HIV risk behaviors. The Political Economy of Health frames the discussion. This study provides evidence for expanding HIV prevention efforts beyond individual risk behaviors to consideration of community factors that may drive the HIV epidemic in rural Malawi."

Serum neopterin and TNF receptor II levels decreased from baseline after 7 days. An antiretroviral effect was observed initially, peaking on days 14-21 (mean change in HIV-1 branched chain DNA assay on day 21 of -0.52 log10; mean change, from baseline to nadir for each individual, of -0.63 log10); subsequent bDNA levels returned toward baseline as prednisone was tapered. No patient lost weight and there was a mean weight gain of 3.5 kg. Anecdotal reports of corticosteroid benefits in the wasting syndrome may result in part from decreased T cell activation leading to decreased HIV replication, an effect that may be self-limited or that may occur only at higher prednisone doses. Studies involving more targeted immunomodulatory agents for wasting syndrome are warranted."
468,0.005,1.0000,"To characterize, over time, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) virus-load change in clinically stable patients, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 RNA levels were measured in serial CSF samples and in plasma samples obtained, during periods of 20 days-6 years, from 17 HIV-infected individuals not receiving antiretroviral treatment. Longitudinal trends were analyzed by linear regression and restricted maximum-likelihood techniques. CSF HIV-1 RNA levels varied within a restricted range (+/-0.5 log(10) copies/mL) around each subject-specific mean. Although 16 of the 17 subjects had CSF slopes not significantly different from zero, slopes that were more positive were associated with lower CD4 counts. In an individual patient, a CSF virus-load change >0.5 log(10) copies/mL may be clinically significant. Furthermore, our data suggest that, if the CSF virus load reflects the size of the reservoir of infected cells in the central nervous system, this reservoir may increase in those individuals with advanced immunosuppression but is stable, over several years, in patients without AIDS."
4951,0.005,1.0000,"Substantial differences have been described in the response of individual patients to zidovudine (ZDV) therapy, both in the clinical impact and in virus load. Genotypic changes associated with the appearance of drug resistance may also be different or occur at different rates. We have obtained the nucleotide sequence of the RT domain of individual HIV-1 genomes extracted from 10 plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples donated by two haemophiliac patients before, during, and after long-term ZDV therapy. Although the plasma virus load was similar throughout, the order and timing of appearance of resistance-associated substitutions differed in the two patients. In patient p74, K70R appeared after 4 months, T215Y at 5.5 months, and M41L at 13 months. In p87, K70R also appeared at 4 months, but T215Y and K219Q were not observed until 18 months and M41L not at all. Much greater sequence change overall occurred in p74. The evolution of the viral population in that patient was dominated by the unique appearance of T215Y and subsequently M41L, with all sequences from the last time point being descended by a single path from the pretreatment samples. However, in p87, several different lineages of RT sequences were found to persist throughout treatment. We propose that these differences in outcome may be determined by differences in genetic background at sites other than the five generally considered to be associated with ZDV sensitivity."
5321,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 and related viruses require co-receptors, in addition to CD4, to infect target cells. The chemokine receptor CCR-5 (ref.1) was recently demonstrated to be a co-receptor for macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 strains, and the orphan receptor LESTR (also called fusin) allows infection by strains adapted for growth in transformed T-cell lines (T-tropic strains). Here we show that a mutant allele of CCR-5 is present at a high frequency in caucasian populations (allele frequency, 0.092), but is absent in black populations from Western and Central Africa and Japanese populations. A 32-base-pair deletion within the coding region results in a frame shift, and generates a non-functional receptor that does not support membrane fusion or infection by macrophage- and dual-tropic HIV-1 strains. In a cohort of HIV-1 infected caucasian subjects, no individual homozygous for the mutation was found, and the frequency of heterozygotes was 35% lower than in the general population. White blood cells from an individual homozygous for the null allele were found to be highly resistant to infection by M-tropic HIV-1 viruses, confirming that CCR-5 is the major co-receptor for primary HIV-1 strains. The lower frequency of heterozygotes in seropositive patients may indicate partial resistance."

There are conflicting data on the effect of HCV on the risk of HIV progression and CD4 response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Long-term prospective cohort studies are clearly required to resolve these issues. The optimal management of the co-infected patient is also unclear. For the co-infected patient, the optimal HAART regimen for best immune CD4 recovery and least adverse reactions remains unclear. Unfortunately, current HCV treatment is associated with significant side effects and a considerable proportion of HIV co-infected patients are poor candidates for HCV treatment. Better and more effective treatment for HCV (preferably not based on interferon) is urgently required for this group of patients. Patients with good CD4 cell count and with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 are likely to have a reasonable response to treatment."
3272,0.005,1.0000,"In about half of patients infected with HIV-1 subtype B, viral populations shift from utilizing the transmembrane protein CCR5 to CXCR4, as well as or instead of CCR5, during late stage progression of the disease. How the relative adhesion efficiency and fusion competency of the viral Env proteins relate to infection during this transition is not well understood. Using a virus-cell fusion assay and live-cell single-molecule force spectroscopy, we compare the entry competency of viral clones to tensile strengths of the individual Env-receptor bonds of Env proteins obtained from a HIV-1 infected patient prior to and during coreceptor switching. The results suggest that the genetic determinants of viral entry were predominantly enriched in the C3, HR1 and CD regions rather than V3. Env proteins can better mediate entry into cells after coreceptor switch; this effective entry capacity does not correlate with the bond strengths between viral Env and cellular receptors."
5888,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) is rarely received by injection drug users (IDU), particularly those co-infected with HIV. We propose a framework for understanding factors that affect utilization and adherence to HCV therapy among HCV mono-infected and HIV/HCV-co-infected IDU. Provision of treatment requires calculation of risks and benefits including evaluation of a number of time-varying factors that collectively determine a gradient of treatment eligibility, advisability and acceptability, the relative importance of which may differ in co-infected and mono-infected IDU. Treatment eligibility is determined by a number of non-modifiable and modifiable contraindications, the latter of which can change over time rendering patients who were once ineligible eligible. Among those eligible, treatment need can be assessed by liver biopsy and therapy may be deferred in those with no liver disease and started in those with significant liver disease. Among those with moderate disease, further consideration of treatment advisability (medical factors that affect treatment response) and acceptability (individual, provider and environmental barriers) is needed before treatment decisions are made. These factors are dynamic and thus should be continually evaluated even among those who may not initially appear to be ready for treatment. An evaluation of this framework is needed to determine applicability and feasibility. Until then, treatment decisions should be made on an individual basis after careful consideration of these issues by provider and patient and efforts to develop novel strategies for identifying IDU who need treatment most (alternatives to liver biopsy) and multidimensional approaches to deliver treatment for HCV while addressing other factors including HIV infection, depression and drug use should be continued."

9579,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and human T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infections have complex effects on adaptive immunity, with specific tropism for, but contrasting effects on, CD4 T lymphocytes: depletion with HIV-1, proliferation with HTLV-1. Impaired T lymphocyte function occurs early in HIV-1 infection but opportunistic infections (OIs) rarely occur in the absence of CD4 lymphopenia. In the unusual case where a HIV-1 infected individual with a high CD4 count presents with recurrent OIs, a clinician is faced with the possibility of a second underlying comorbidity. We present a case of pseudo-adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfection where the individual fulfilled Shimoyama criteria for chronic ATLL and had pulmonary Mycobacterium kansasii, despite a high CD4 lymphocyte count. However, there was no evidence of clonal T-cell proliferation by T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies nor of monoclonal HTLV-1 integration by high-throughput sequencing. Mutually beneficial interplay between HIV-1 and HTLV-1, maintaining high level HIV-1 and HTLV-1 viremia and proliferation of poorly functional CD4 cells despite chronicity of infection is a postulated mechanism. Despite good microbiological response to antimycobacterial therapy, the patient remained systemically unwell with refractory anemia. Subsequent initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy led to paradoxical resolution of CD4 T lymphocytosis as well as HIV-1 viral suppression and decreased HTLV-1 proviral load. This is proposed to be the result of attenuation of immune activation post-HIV virological control. This case illustrates the importance of screening for HTLV-1 in HIV-1 patients with appropriate clinical presentation and epidemiological risk factors and explores mechanisms for the complex interactions on HIV-1/HTLV-1 adaptive immunity."

Despite the good safety profile of the drug, Fanconi syndrome is a possible adverse reaction of TDF treatment, especially in HIV-infected patients. Only a few cases have been reported in patients with CHB-monoinfections. This report presents a case of a 58-year-old man with mild HBeAg-negative CHB who was exposed to TDF and developed drug-induced Fanconi syndrome. Renal dysfunction reverted after TDF discontinuation and a switch to entecavir, and viral replication remained suppressed. A literature review yielded six additional cases of TDF-induced Fanconi syndrome, all with risk factors for renal dysfunction despite the patients having normal glomerular filtration rates. We discuss the overall risk for Fanconi syndrome in CHB-monoinfected patients exposed to TDF and the importance of careful monitoring of glomerular and tubular functions even when pre-existing kidney disease is not present.

We obtained clinical and laboratory markers, and registered previous or current treatment with tenofovir (TDF) and indinavir (IDV). The sample was divided according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation. Group 1: eGFR ≤60 mL/min/1.73 m; group 2: eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m.Among the patients, 76.4% were men, mean age (SD) 45 ± 9 years, time since diagnose of HIV 14 ± 7 years, and 47.2% of the patients received previous treatment with TDF and 39.1% with IDV. In 2008, eGFR ≤60: 4.9% (91.4% of them in chronic kidney disease [CKD] stage 3, eGFR 59-30 mL/min); this group was older, presented higher fibrinogen levels, and more patients were treated previously with TDF and IDV. In 2010, eGFR ≤60: 3.9% (87.1% stage 3 CKD). The 2.4% of cohort showed renal improvement and 1.3% decline of renal function over time. The absence of hypertension and treatment with TDF were associated with improvement in eGFR. Increased age, elevated fibrinogen, decreased albumin, diabetes mellitus, hyperTG, and worse virological control were risk factors for renal impairment.The HIV-positive patients in our area have a CKD prevalence of 4% to 5% (90% stage 3 CKD) associated with ageing, inflammation, worse immune control of HIV, TDF treatment, and metabolic syndrome."

We investigated the effect of TDF on renal insufficiency in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).A consecutive cohort analysis was applied to CHB patients taking prescribed TDF from January 2012 to May 2016 at Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital. Alterations over time in corrected calcium, phosphate, creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were analyzed using the generalized estimating equation method. The percentage increase in creatinine from baseline to the maximum creatinine level (delta creatinine) was compared according to the underlying disease using the Mann-Whitney U test. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to determine risk factors associated with renal insufficiency.The baseline creatinine, eGFR, corrected calcium, and phosphate levels were 0.72 ± 0.01 mg/dL (mean ± SD), 106.37 ± 1.06 mL/min/1.73 m, 8.82 ± 0.04 mg/dL, and 3.42 ± 0.05 mg/dL, respectively. The creatinine level had increased significantly at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 weeks, while the eGFR level had decreased significantly at these 5 time points. Multivariate analysis confirmed that age ≥60 years and the baseline bilirubin level were independently associated with the risk of renal insufficiency. Delta creatinine was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) than in patients without DM.Renal function was decreased from baseline in CHB patients receiving TDF therapy, which indicates that the renal function of patients undergoing treatment with TDF should be monitored regularly. Old age, DM, and serum bilirubin were risk factors for the development of renal insufficiency in CHB patients receiving TDF therapy."

Chronic Hepatitis B was diagnosed biochemically, serologically and histopathologically. They were HBsAg(+), HBV-DNA(+), and HCV(-), HIV(-). Seven cases were HBeAg(+) and two of them were anti-Delta IgG(+). Liver biopsy revealed chronic active hepatitis in six cases and persistent hepatitis in three cases. IFN was given at the dose of 5 MU/m2 three times a week, subcutaneously for 6 months. It was well tolerated. After IFN therapy, ALT levels returned to normal in seven cases. All cases were still HBsAg(+). Four of them seroconverted to anti-HBe antibody. Loss of serum HBV-DNA in three cases, but 11 cases showed a marked decrease after IFN. The control liver biopsies showed that histopathological activity index was diminished in five cases. Other 16 patients, serving as control, received no therapy. Five of them were leukaemia and others were solid tumours. Twelve cases were male. Mean age was 9.3 years with a range of 4-19 years.

9620,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 plays an important role in mediating the fusion of HIV with host cells. During the fusion process, three N-terminal helices and three C-terminal helices pack in an anti-parallel direction to form a six-helix bundle. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the gp41 core demonstrated that within each coiled-coil interface, there is a deep and large pocket, formed by a cluster of residues in the N-helix coiled-coil. In this report, we systematically analyzed the role of seven conserved residues that are either lining or packing this pocket on the infectivity and interhelical interaction using novel approaches. Our results show that residues L568, V570, W571, and K574 of the N-helix that are lining the side chain and right wall of the pocket are important for establishing a productive infection. Mutations V570A and W571A completely abolished replication, while replication of the L568A and K574A mutants was significantly attenuated relative to wild type. Similarly, residues W628, W631, and I635 of the C-helix that insert into the pocket are essential for infectivity. The impaired infectivity of these seven mutants is in part attributed to the loss in binding affinity of the interhelical interaction. Molecular modeling of the crystal structure of the coiled-coil further shows that alanine substitution of those residues disrupts the hydrophobic interaction between the N- and C-helix. These results suggest that the conserved residues in the coiled-coil domain play a key role in HIV infection and this coiled-coil pocket is a good target for development of inhibitors against HIV. In addition, our data indicate that the novel fluorescence polarization assay described in this study could be valuable in screening for inhibitors that block the interhelical interaction and HIV entry."

The importance of neutralizing antibodies in containing primary viremia is questioned because they usually arise much later. Nevertheless antienvelope antibodies develop simultaneously with, or even before, peak viremia. We determined whether such antibodies might control viremia by complement-mediated inactivation (CMI). In each of seven patients studied, antibodies capable of CMI appeared at or shortly after the peak in viremia, concomitantly with detection of virus-specific T-cell responses. The CMI was effective on both autologous and heterologous HIV-1 isolates. Activation of the classical pathway and direct viral lysis were at least partly responsible. Since immunoglobulin G (IgG)-antibodies triggered the CMI, specific memory B cells could also be induced by vaccination. Thus, consideration should be given to vaccination strategies that induce IgG antibodies capable of CMI."

The chimpanzee immunized with pCMN160 demonstrated enhanced humoral responses. Virus load was monitored. Virus load in the chimpanzee receiving pCMN160 decreased at week 20 and has remained at background levels. The control chimpanzee was subsequently vaccinated with pCMN160.

3163,0.005,1.0000,"Individuals living with HIV who are optimally treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can now lead an extended life. In spite of this remarkable survival benefit from viral suppression achieved by cART in peripheral blood, the rate of mild to moderate cognitive impairment remains high. A cognitive decline that includes impairments in attention, learning and executive function is accompanied by increased rates of mood disorders that together adversely impact the daily life of those with chronic HIV infection. The evidence is clear that cells in the brain are infected with HIV that has crossed the blood-brain barrier both as cell-free virus and within infected monocytes and T cells. Viral proteins that circulate in blood can induce brain endothelial cells to release cytokines, invoking another source of neuroinflammation. The difficulty of efficient delivery of cART to the central nervous system (CNS) contributes to elevated viral load in the CNS, resulting in a persistent HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The pathogenesis of HAND is multifaceted, and mounting evidence indicates that immune cells play a major role. HIV-infected monocytes and T cells not only infect brain resident cells upon migration into the CNS but also produce proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1ß, which in turn, further activate microglia and astrocytes. These activated brain resident cells, along with perivascular macrophages, are the main contributors to neuroinflammation in HIV infection and release neurotoxic factors such as excitatory amino acids and inflammatory mediators, resulting in neuronal dysfunction and death. Cytokines, which are elevated in the blood of patients with HIV infection, may also contribute to brain inflammation by entering the brain from the blood. Host factors such as aging and co-morbid conditions such as cytomegalovirus co-infection and vascular pathology are important factors that affect the HIV-host immune interactions in HAND pathogenesis. By these diverse mechanisms, HIV-1 induces a neuroinflammatory response that is likely to be a major contributor to the cognitive and behavior changes seen in HIV infection. "

In this review, we will first outline these changes based on epidemiological studies and describe the impact of cART on lymphoma risk and mortality. Then, we will discuss some immunological factors that may contribute to the increased risk of lymphoma persisting after the administration of cART, including immunological non-response to therapy, chronic B-cell activation and dysfunction, T follicular helper cells, natural killer cells and altered lymphopoiesis.

4988,0.005,1.0000,"Primary HIV-1 infection induces a virus-specific adaptive/cytolytic immune response that impacts the plasma viral load set point and the rate of progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppresses plasma viremia to undetectable levels that rebound upon cART treatment interruption. Following cART withdrawal, the memory component of the virus-specific adaptive immune response may improve viral control compared to primary infection. Here, using primary infection and treatment interruption data from macaques infected with simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), we observe a lower peak viral load but an unchanged viral set point during viral rebound. The addition of an autologous stem cell transplant before cART withdrawal alters viral dynamics: we found a higher rebound set point but similar peak viral loads compared to the primary infection. Mathematical modeling of the data that accounts for fundamental immune parameters achieves excellent fit to heterogeneous viral loads. Analysis of model output suggests that the rapid memory immune response following treatment interruption does not ultimately lead to better viral containment. Transplantation decreases the durability of the adaptive immune response following cART withdrawal and viral rebound. Our model's results highlight the impact of the endogenous adaptive immune response during primary SHIV infection. Moreover, because we capture adaptive immune memory and the impact of transplantation, this model will provide insight into further studies of cure strategies inspired by the Berlin patient."

7193,0.005,1.0000,"Here the authors discuss evidence in human and animal models supporting two opposing views regarding the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the central nervous system (CNS): (1) HIV infection in the CNS is a compartmentalized infection, with the virus-infected macrophages entering the CNS early, infecting resident microglia and astrocytes, and achieving a state of latency with evolution toward a fulminant CNS infection late in the course of disease; or alternatively, (2) events in the periphery lead to altered monocyte/macrophage (MPhi) homeostasis, with increased CNS invasion of infected and/or uninfected MPhis. Here the authors have reevaluated evidence presented in the favor of the latter model, with a discussion of phenotypic characteristics distinguishing normal resident microglia with those accumulating in HIV encephalitis (HIVE). CD163 is normally expressed by perivascular MPhi s but not resident microglia in normal CNS of humans and rhesus macaques. In agreement with other studies, the authors demonstrate expression of CD163 by brain MPhi s in HIVE and simian immunodeficiency virus encephalitis (SIVE). CNS tissues from HIV-sero positive individuals with HIVE or HIV-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were also examined. In HIVE, the authors further demonstrate colocalization of CD163 and CD16 (Fcgamma III recptor) gene expression, the latter marker associated with HIV infection of monocyte in vivo and permissivity of infection. Indeed, CD163(+) MPhis and microglia are often productively infected in HIVE CNS. In SIV infected rhesus macaques, CD163(+) cells accumulate perivascularly, within nodular lesions and the parenchyma in animals with encephalitis. Likewise, parenchymal microglia and perivascular MPhi s are CD163(+) in HIVE. In contrast to HIVE, CD163(+)perivascular and parenchymal MPhi s in HIV-associated PML were only associated with areas of demyelinating lesions. Interestingly, SIV-infected rhesus macaques whose viral burden was predominantly at 1 x 10(6) copies/ml or greater developed encephalitis. To further investigate the relationship between CD163(+)/CD16(+) MPhis/microglia in the CNS and altered homeostasis in the periphery, the authors performed flow-cytometric analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The results demonstrate an increase in the percent frequency of CD163(+)/CD16(+) monocytes in animals with detectable virus that correlated significantly with increased viral burden and CD4(+) T-cell decline. These results suggest the importance of this monocyte subset in HIV/SIV CNS disease, and also in the immune pathogenesis of lentiviral infection. The authors further discuss the potential role of CD163(+)/CD16(+) monocyte/MPhi subset expansion, altered myeloid homeostasis, and potential consequences for immune polarization and suppression. The results and discussion here suggest new avenues for the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) therapeutics and vaccine design."
7200,0.005,1.0000,"Although annual influenza vaccination is recommended for persons who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), data are limited regarding the epidemiology of influenza or the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in this population. We investigated a 1996 outbreak of infection with influenza A at a residential facility for persons with AIDS. We interviewed 118 residents and employees, reviewed 65 resident medical records, and collected serum samples for measurement of influenza antibody titers. After controlling for history of smoking, influenza vaccination, and resident or employee status, in a multivariate model, HIV infection was not statistically associated with influenza-like illness (ILI). Symptoms and duration of ILI were similar for most HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected persons. However, 8 (21.1%) of 38 HIV-infected persons with ILI (vs. none of 15 HIV-uninfected persons) were either hospitalized, evaluated in an emergency room, or had ILI lasting > or = 14 days (P=.06). Vaccination effectiveness (VE) was similar for HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected persons. Vaccination was most effective among HIV-infected persons with CD4 cell counts of >100 cells/microL (VE, 65%; 95% CI, 36%--81%) or HIV type 1 virus load of <30,000 copies/mL (VE, 52%; 95% CI, 11%--75%). Providers should continue to offer influenza vaccination to HIV-infected persons."

T., resident of Central Africa, are discussed, in whom Kaposi sarcoma was diagnosed clinically and histologically, and immunological examinations revealed the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Cocultivation of the peripheral blood leukocytes of the patient with normal donor leukocytes yielded a leukocyte culture in which HIV virus expression was demonstrated. The HIV antigen was detected in the ultracentrifugate of the cultures by means of indirect enzyme-immunoassay using sera to the virus from the standard kits of Organon (Netherlands) and Abbot (USA). HIV antigen was also detected on the surface of lymphocytes in the culture by indirect immunofluorescence using the same sera. Besides, reverse transcriptase activity was demonstrated in ultracentrifugates of the culture fluid by exogenous reverse transcription test using poly(zA)-oligo(dT) matrix."
8306,0.005,1.0000,"Microglial cells, the resident macrophages of the brain, play an important role in the neuropathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and recent studies suggest that opioid peptides regulate the function of macrophages from somatic tissues. We report herein the presence of kappa opioid receptors (KORs) in human fetal microglia and inhibition of HIV-1 expression in acutely infected microglial cell cultures treated with KOR ligands. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analyses, we found that mRNA for the KOR was constitutively expressed in microglia and determined that the nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame was identical to that of the human brain KOR gene. The expression of KOR in microglial cells was confirmed by membrane binding of [3H]U69,593, a kappa-selective ligand, and by indirect immunofluorescence. Treatment of microglial cell cultures with U50,488 or U69,593 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of expression of the monocytotropic HIV-1 SF162 strain. This antiviral effect of the kappa ligands was blocked by the specific KOR antagonist, nor-binaltrophimine. These findings suggest that kappa opioid agonists have immunomodulatory activity in the brain, and that these compounds could have potential in the treatment of HIV-1-associated encephalopathy."
6380,0.005,1.0000,"In Italy, about 7 % of the resident population is represented by immigrants originating from geographic regions at high endemicity for hepatitis B virus infection. This study aims to assess the prevalence of occult HBV infection (OBI) including the identification of HBV-genotypes in a population of immigrants serologically negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Between May 2006 and May 2010, 339 immigrants were tested for markers of HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. HBV-DNA was tested by using nested-PCR assays on three different genetic region. HBV-DNA was detected in plasma samples of 11/339 (3.2 %) patients. Most of them had no serological markers of HBV infection, 3/58 (5.2 %) were anti-HBc-alone, and 4/13 (30.8 %) were anti-HIV positive. HIV positivity was the only factor independently associated with the higher probability of observing OBI (OR = 16.5, p < 0.001). No HCV co-infected patients were found. Genotype D was detected in 9/11 (81.8 %) OBI cases, while the remaining two (18.2 %) were classified as genotype E. Although OBI was found at lower rate than expected among immigrants from highly endemic countries, anti-HBc alone positivity was confirmed as a sentinel marker of occult HBV infection. Nevertheless, a marked heterogeneity of HBV markers was found among HBV-DNA positive subjects. Our finding evidenced the predominance of HBV-genotype D viral strains among OBI cases, also in those from geographical areas where overt HBV infections are mainly sustained by viral genotypes other than D.

4329,0.005,1.0000,"Macrophages are major targets of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and can act as long‑term reservoirs of the virus. Chronic HIV‑1 infection is associated with dysregulated inflammation. Recepteur d'origine nantais (RON) is expressed in tissue resident macrophages and functions to maintain inflammatory homeostasis. The present study aimed to compare the expression of RON on HIV-positive and -negative participants, and to investigate the mechanism by which HIV‑1 influences the expression and function of RON in the JLTRG T cell line. The levels of RON and the RON ligand, macrophage‑stimulating protein (MSP), in the peripheral blood of HIV‑1-positive patients that were receiving (n=22) or not receiving highly active anti‑retroviral therapy (HAART) (n=82) and 37 healthy control participants were determined by enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of RON and MSP in the JLTRG T cell line was assessed by western blotting and the subcellular location was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. JLTRG cells were co‑cultured with a cell line that stably expresses HIV, H9/HTLV‑IIIB, and alterations in the levels of RON and nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) in JLTRG cells were assessed by western blotting. The expression of RON and MSP were significantly different in the serum of HIV‑1-positive patients that were receiving HAART compared with those not receiving HAART (P<0.05) and healthy control patients (P<0.01). RON was detected in JLTRG cells, and was shown to be downregulated by HIV‑1 infection. HIV‑1 infection of JLTRG cells also reduced NF‑κB phosphorylation. Thus, HIV‑1 was shown to downregulate the expression and phosphorylation of RON by targeting the NF‑κB pathway. "
2575,0.005,1.0000,"Hyperimmune activation is a strong predictor of disease progression during pathogenic immunodeficiency virus infections and is mediated in part by sustained type I IFN signaling in response to adventitious microbial infection. The immune inhibitory receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1) regulates functional exhaustion of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells during chronic infections, and in vivo PD-1 blockade has been shown to improve viral control of SIV. Here, we show that PD-1 blockade during chronic SIV infection markedly reduced the expression of transcripts associated with type I IFN signaling in the blood and colorectal tissue of rhesus macaques (RMs). The effect of PD-1 blockade on type I IFN signaling was durable and persisted even under conditions of high viremia. Reduced type I IFN signaling was associated with enhanced expression of some of the junction-associated genes in colorectal tissue and with a profound decrease in plasma LPS levels, suggesting a possible repair of gut-associated junctions and decreased microbial translocation into the blood. PD-1 blockade enhanced immunity to gut-resident pathogenic bacteria, control of gut-associated opportunistic infections, and survival of SIV-infected RMs. Our results suggest PD-1 blockade as a potential novel therapeutic approach to enhance combination antiretroviral therapy by suppressing hyperimmune activation in HIV-infected individuals."
3599,0.005,1.0000,"More than 90% of pediatric AIDS results from the transmission of the virus through HIV positive pregnant mothers to their children. However, little has been known about factors associated with unintended pregnancies after knowing their HIV seropositive status, or contraceptive use among HIV positive women under antiretroviral treatment (ART). We investigated thus factors associated with unintended pregnancies after knowing seropositive status, and also factors associated with the non-use of contraceptives among HIV positive women under ART. We carried out a cross-sectional study in Kigali, Rwanda in 2007. A total of 565 HIV positive women under ART were interviewed. We examined the associated factors of unintended pregnancies or non-use of contraceptives using logistic regression analysis. Among all the respondents (n = 565), 132 women became pregnant after knowing their HIV seropositive status. Among them, 82 (62.7%) got pregnant unintentionally. Those who had two or more children (adjusted OR, 3.83) were more likely to get pregnant unintentionally. Meanwhile, among all, 263 had sexual intercourse during the last three months. Of them, 85 women did not use any contraceptives. Those who did not agree that 'HIV positive children can survive as long as HIV negative children' (adjusted OR, 2.28), and those who 'can always ask partner to use a condom' (adjusted OR, 9.83), were more likely to use contraceptives. This study suggests that HIV positive women under ART need special support to avoid unintended pregnancies especially those who have two or more children. Moreover, interventions are also needed to improve women's understanding of the prognosis of pediatric AIDS, and condom-use negotiation skills."
3645,0.005,1.0000,"To evaluate the prevalence of hepatitis virus markers and human T-cell lymphotropic virus infections among drug abusers in Japan, serum samples were collected from 91 male drug abusers at the Shinshu University Hospital and the rehabilitation facility in Matsumoto and from 519 healthy male blood donors as controls. Sera were tested for antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), immunoglobulin M anti-HBc (IgM anti-HBc), antibody to hepatitis D virus (anti-HDV), antibody to HTLV type 1 (anti-HTLV 1), and antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV). The prevalence of anti-HAV was 13.2% in drug abusers and 10.8% in controls (not significant). The prevalences of HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc and exposure rate to hepatitis B virus (HBV) were 4.4%, 24.2%, 31.9%, and 35.2%, respectively, in drug abusers and 0.8%, 6.7%, 9.6%, and 9.6% in controls. The exposure rate to HBV was significantly different (P less than 0.001). IgM anti-HBc and anti-HDV were not detected in any sera. Anti-HTLV I was detected in three drug abusers (3.3%) and in one (0.2%) of the controls (P less than 0.01). All sera were negative for anti-HIV in all subjects. Infection with HBV and HTLV I is more common among drug abusers than in the general population of blood donors in Japan."
7683,0.005,1.0000,"The T-cell-mediated immune response plays a crucial role in defense against hepatotropic viruses as well as in the pathogenesis of viral chronic hepatitides. However, very little is known about the role of specific T cells during hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in humans. In this study, the T-cell response to HDV in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers with HDV superinfection was investigated at different levels. Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation in response to a recombinant form of large hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) revealed that 8 of 30 patients studied (27%) specifically responded to HDAg. By employing synthetic peptides spanning the entire HDAg sequence, we found that T-cell recognition was directed against different antigenic determinants, with patient-to-patient variation in the pattern of response to peptides. Interestingly, all responders had signs of inactive HDV-induced disease, while none of the patients with active disease and none of the control subjects showed any significant proliferation. More accurate information about the specific T-cell response was obtained at the clonal level. A panel of HDAg-specific CD4+ T-cell clones from three HDV-infected individuals and fine-specificity analysis revealed that the clones tested individually recognized four epitopes corresponding to amino acids (aa) 26 to 41, 50 to 65, 66 to 81, or 106 to 121 of HDAg sequence. The study of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction revealed that peptides 50 to 65 and 106 to 121 were presented to specific T cells in association with multiple class II molecules. In addition, peptide 26 to 41 was efficiently generated after processing of HDAg through the endogenous processing pathway. Cytokine secretion analysis showed that all the CD4+ T-cell clones assayed were able to produce high levels of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), belonging either to T helper-1 (Th1) or Th0 subsets and that some of them were cytotoxic in a specific assay. This study provides the first evidence that detection of a specific T-cell response to HDAg in the peripheral blood of individuals with hepatitis delta is related to the decrease of HDV-induced disease activity. The HDAg epitopes identified here and particularly those recognized by CD4+ T cells in association with multiple major histocompatibility complex class II molecules may be potentially exploited for the preparation of a vaccine for prophylaxis and therapy of HDV infection."
7287,0.005,1.0000,"Human hepatitis delta (delta) virus (HDV) is a form of defective virus, which infects humans only in the presence of a co-infecting hepatitis B virus (HBV). HDV superinfection in a chronic HBV carrier often results in severe chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, whereas acute HDV and HBV co-infection is frequently associated with fulminant hepatitis. HDV consists of a 36-nm particle, which contains an envelope with HBV surface antigen, and a nucleocapsid containing the hepatitis delta-antigen (HDAg) and an RNA genome of 1.75 kilobases (kb). Recently, the genomic RNA from an HDV serially passaged in chimpanzees has been cloned and sequenced in a study which showed that the HDV RNA is a single-stranded circular molecule with properties similar to those of viroid or virusoid. However, it is not known whether serial passages in chimpanzees had altered the properties of human HDV. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of an HDV RNA isolated directly from a patient with acute delta-hepatitis. The sequence showed considerable divergence (11%) from that of the chimpanzee-adapted HDV. Five open reading frames (ORFs) of more than 100 amino acids in both genomic and anti-genomic sense were found. The largest ORF in antigenomic sense, which can code for 214 amino acids, may correspond to the HDAg."
8427,0.005,1.0000,"In Taiwan, injecting drug use has been the main route of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission since 2005, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) also having similar transmission routes. This has now become an important public health issue. The aim of this study is to explore the conditions of HDV infections between injecting drug users (IDUs) with and without HIV infection in Southern Taiwan. In this study, 87 IDUs were enrolled, including 27 anti-HDV seronegative IDUs and 60 anti-HDV seropositive IDUs, and the results of their liver function tests, CD4 cell counts, and anti-HIV and HIV RNA levels were analyzed. The prevalence of anti-HDV seropositivity among hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositive IDUs in this study was 68.9% (60/87). The prevalence rate of anti-HDV seropositive IDUs among anti-HIV seronegative and anti-HIV seropositive cases was 40.0% (12/30) and 84.2% (48/57), respectively. Anti-HIV seropositivity was related to anti-HDV seropositivity (odds ratio = 9.34, 95% confidence interval = 2.67-31.59, p < 0.001). Among IDUs with HIV infection, there was no significant difference in CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA viral load between HBsAg-positive patients with anti-HDV seronegativity and those with anti-HDV seropositivity. In conclusion, the prevalence of HDV infection among IDUs is higher among IDUs with HIV infection. Because anti-HIV seropositivity is significantly related to anti-HDV seropositivity, HDV infection among IDUs is still important. We suggest that for IDUs, HBsAg and anti-HDV should be monitored closely."
4625,0.005,1.0000,"Twenty-four of over 24,000 patients genotyped over the past 3 years were found to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates that possess an insert in the protease gene. In this report, we evaluated the spectrum of protease gene insertion mutations in patient isolates and analyzed the effect of these various insertion mutations on viral phenotypes. The inserts were composed of 1, 2, 5, or 6 amino acids that mapped at or between codons 35 and 38, 17 and 18, 21 and 25, or 95 and 96. Reduced susceptibility to protease inhibitors was found in isolates which possess previously reported drug resistance mutations. Fitness assays, including replication and competition experiments, showed that most of the isolates with inserts grew somewhat better than their counterparts with a deletion of the insert. These experiments demonstrate that, rarely, insertion mutations can develop in the HIV type 1 protease gene, are no more resistant than any other sequences which have similar associated resistance mutations, and can provide a borderline advantage in replication."
821,0.005,1.0000,"Recurring outbreaks of acute hepatitis have been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among Peruvian military personnel stationed in the Amazon Basin region of Peru. The role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection was investigated as the possible cause of acute hepatitis among 88 military patients stationed at four different jungle outposts during 1992-1993. Analysis of serum markers indicated that 95% (84/88) had evidence of acute HBV infection; 64% (54/84) were also infected with HDV. Genetic analysis of PCR-amplified HDV and HBV fragments showed exclusively HDV genotype III and HBV genotype F. Furthermore, HDV RNA sequences were similar among patients from the same outpost but different from those at other jungle locations. The data suggested focal sources of HDV infection in the jungle environment of the outposts and, further, confirmed the unique association of HDV genotype III with severe cases of human disease in northern South America."

Seventeen were HIV negative, 30 were HIV positive without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 35 had been diagnosed as having AIDS. Antihepatitis D virus (HDV) in serum was measured by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and also by solid phase capture radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HDV. HDV antigen and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA were also measured. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBs were determined by using a commercially available RIA. Anti-HDV (RIA) was only detected in serum that contained HBsAg. These anti-HDV (RIA) positive samples also tested positive with the commercial anti-HDV electroimmunoassay. In addition, the commercial anti-HDV ELISA detected anti-HDV in some serum samples that were negative for HBsAg; these anti HDV-positive HBsAg-negative samples were frequently lipemic or contained rheumatoid factor. The prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBs did not differ significantly with the stage of HIV disease. HBsAg was detected in 3 of 13 (23%) HIV-negative, 5 of 29 (17%) HIV-positive, and 4 of 18 (22%) patients with AIDS. IgG and IgM anti-HDV (RIA) was positive in 2 of 3 HIV-negative and 4 of 5 HIV-positive pre-AIDS HBsAg-positive subjects. However, none of 4 AIDS patients had anti-HDV. The difference between AIDS and non-AIDS patients was statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.03).

8461,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B is widespread and represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality due to the evolution to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This study was designed to improve the national laboratory surveillance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, focusing on genomic analysis of isolates from Romanian patients. Sera from ten patients with HBV were collected and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on a DNA fragment spanning almost the entire genome. The occurrence of mutations was assessed for each open reading frame in the viral genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five isolates belonging to genotype A (subgenotype A2) and other five clustering with genotype D strains (subgenotype D1). Two patients treated with lamivudine were found to carry isolates harboring rtM204V lamivudine resistance mutation. An HBV isolate displaying a lamivudine complex resistance pattern, rtM204I in conjunction with rtL180M and rtA200V, was found in a lamivudine naïve patient. All samples harbored sA105P substitution, usually found in HBIg therapy escape isolates. Three of the studied strains were simultaneously displaying T1753, T1762 and A1764 mutations which in vitro induce enhanced genome replication and reduction of HBeAg expression. The sequence obtained from a patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis presents a novel type of insertion consisting of nine nucleotides between positions 260 and 261 in the X gene. Despite the small number of samples, our findings suggest the need to determine the drug resistance pattern for each patient before taking a therapeutic decision and also highlight the necessity of knowing the real level of drug resistance among HBV strains circulating in Romania."
6426,0.005,1.0000,"Europe is currently observing a significant rise in non-B subtypes. Consequently, the effect of genetic variability on therapy response or genotypic resistance interpretation algorithms is an emerging concern. The purpose of this study is to investigate the amino acid substitutions selected under drug pressure in the protease of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes B and G, and determine if there are any significant differences. We investigated therapy-related and subtype-related substitutions in the protease, considering subtype, overall protease inhibitor treatment and individual drug exposure. Many mutations were significantly related to protease inhibitor (PI) therapy, with mutations exclusive to subtype B or subtype G. Some mutations are at positions related to resistance in both subtypes, but the amino acid substitution is different. Other mutations were significantly associated with subtype and PI selective pressure (p<0.05), pointing towards a differential selective pressure in both subtypes. We confirmed previous reports on the subtype-dependent selection of D30N and 89I, and identified a new mutation with such differential selective pressure: 37D was preferentially selected by lopinavir in subtype B. Other novel mutations found under therapy pressure were 13A, 35N, K55R, I66F, I72L/T, T74S, 82M and 89I/V. Our study indicates that even though in general, drug selective pressure and resistance pathways are relatively similar between subtypes B and G, some differences do occur, leading to subtype-dependent substitutions."

The authors evaluated ED, clinical, and emotional variables in a group of 501 HIV-infected men in a cross-sectional 4-month observational study. ED was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function-5 and emotional status using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire. Median age (interquartile range) was 42 (35, 48) years. Time since HIV diagnosis was 6.3 (2.6, 17.1) years, 92% were taking antiretroviral treatment and 81.8% had an HIV-RNA viral load <50 copies. The prevalence of ED was 58.5%. ED was mild in 30.1%, mild to moderate in 19.5%, moderate in 6.1%, and severe in 2.5%. ED medications were used by 19% of men. In the univariate analysis, the variables associated with all degrees of ED were older age, longer time since HIV diagnosis, higher scores in HAD, not taking efavirenz, taking etravirine, taking ritonavir, HIV/Hepatitis C Virus coinfection, and taking a protease inhibitor-containing regimen. For mild to moderate, moderate, and severe ED, the same variables were significant, as were lower nadir CD4 cell count, lower social support, taking atazanavir, concomitant conditions, and concomitant treatments. The variables that remained significant in the multivariate analyses, considering all degrees of ED or excluding mild ED were the following: older age and higher scores in HAD total. In summary, ED affected more than half of this cohort of well controlled HIV-infected men. Age and emotional status seemed to play a fundamental role in its presence."

One member of this group is human immunodeficiency virus type-2 (HIV-2), previously designated lymphadenopathy-associated virus type-2 (LAV-2), found in patients with an AIDS-like illness. In this report, we show that 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides including 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) can significantly inhibit the infectivity and/or cytopathic effect of these retroviruses in vitro. Current data provide a rationale for considering 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides and their derivatives as experimental antiviral agents in individuals with illnesses caused by these new retroviruses."
7165,0.005,1.0000,"Studies have shown equivalent or improved outcomes with once-daily antiretroviral (ARV) regimens, but have failed to quantify the true daily dosing frequency and pill burden of HIV-infected patients, by not considering concomitant medications. This study was conducted to describe the total daily number (pill burden) and dosing frequency for all oral medicines, and not just ARV medications in HIV-infected patients with undetectable viral loads. A retrospective chart review of patients with undetectable viral loads in an HIV primary care clinic identified dosing frequency and pill burden for all prescribed medications. These patients were divided into those with concomitant medications (WITH) and those only on ARV medications (WITHOUT). One hundred and seventeen patients qualified for the evaluation. Ninety-three were in the WITH group and 24 were in the WITHOUT group. WITH patients were older (p < 0.05), and had advanced US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-defined HIV disease stage (p< 0.05), a longer duration of HIV infection (p= 0.03), and a longer duration of AIDS (p= 0.02). WITH patients had a significantly greater total pill burden (p<0.01) and dosing frequency (p<0.001) when considering all medications. Assessing only ARV medications, a significant difference existed only in pill burden (mean +/- SD) (WITH = 9.91 +/- 2.1 versus WITHOUT = 6.6 +/- 1; p < 0.01), and no difference existed in ARV dosing frequency of 2.09 +/- 1.9 and 1.83 +/- 1.7, respectively (p = 0.07). Higher dosing frequencies and pill burdens were present in patients with co-morbid conditions. All patients were on more than once-daily therapies. Dosing requirements for non-ARV medications should also be considered when optimizing or simplifying ARV regimens."

Sera from 201 hepatitis B e antigen positive Chinese patients (including 106 who participated in a controlled trial of IFN therapy) with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of HBV DNA after amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Forty-three (21%) patients had M1 (T-1856), and 20 patients (10%) had M2 (A-1896). During a follow-up period of 1 to 7 years, 75%, 28%, and 26% of those with M2 (A-1896), M1 (T-1856), and wild type sequence respectively, cleared HBeAg (P < .0001). Eighteen (67%) of 27 patients with wild-type sequence but none of 10 patients who had M1 (T-1856) in their initial samples developed M2 (A-1896) after loss of HBeAg (P < .0001). Sustained antiviral response was achieved in 55%, 0%, and 17% of interferon-treated patients who had M2 (A-1896), M1 (T-1856), and wild-type sequence, respectively, initially (P = .04). However, patients with M2 (A-1896) were also more likely to have elevated pretreatment aminotransferase levels (P = .02). In summary, HBeAg-positive Chinese patients with M2 (A-1896) were mor likely to clear HBeAg, and to do so earlier.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
352,0.005,1.0000,"The safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of lopinavir, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor, coformulated with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer were evaluated in 38 antiretroviral-naive patients randomized 1:1 to receive open-label lopinavir/ritonavir at a dose of 800/200 mg once daily or 400/100 mg twice daily, each in combination with stavudine and lamivudine twice daily, for 48 weeks. Over the course of 48 weeks, median predose concentrations of lopinavir exceeded the protein-binding corrected concentration required to inhibit replication of wild-type HIV by 50% in vitro by 40- and 84-fold in the once- and twice-daily groups, respectively. Predose concentrations of lopinavir were more variable in the once-daily group (mean +/- SD, 3.62+/-3.38 microg/mL for the once-daily group and 7.13+/-2.93 microg/mL for the twice-daily group). At week 48, in an intent-to-treat (missing = failure) analysis, 74% of patients in the once-daily group and 79% of patients in the twice-daily group had HIV RNA levels of <50 copies/mL (P=.70). Study drug-related discontinuations occurred in 1 patient in each treatment group. Genotypic resistance testing of 4 patients with HIV RNA levels >400 copies/mL between weeks 24 and 48 demonstrated no protease inhibitor-resistance mutations."
633,0.005,1.0000,"We report the case of two patients in whom acute hepatitis A was associated with a marked and prolonged increase in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral load. Although in one patient the rise in HIV-1 RNA might also have been related to the interruption of antiretroviral therapy, we also observed a similar pattern in the other patient who had a stable undetectable plasma viraemia prior to acute hepatitis and never received treatment with anti-retrovirals. Our observation supports the hypothesis that immune activation that is induced by acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection may trigger HIV-1 replication. This highlights the importance of maintaining antiretroviral therapy throughout the acute phase of hepatitis A and of preventing HAV infection through active immunization."
6809,0.005,1.0000,"BK virus is ubiquitous worldwide, with infection usually occurring in early childhood. BK virus replicates prolifically under immunosuppressive conditions, causing inflammation along the genitourinary tract and progressing clinically to hemorrhagic cystitis, ureteral stenosis, and tubulointerstitial nephritis. Most BK virusassociated nephropathy occurs in renal allograft patients after kidney transplantation, although some case reports have described BK virus-associated nephropathy in the native kidney, particularly in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Here we present the case of a 49-year-old male with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and renal dysfunction with hydronephrosis. The renal biopsy showed tubulointerstitial nephritis with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates and intranuclear inclusions in the tubular epithelium, which are typical findings for BK virus-associated nephropathy. In addition, immunohistochemical staining revealed that the SV40 large T antigen exhibited a nuclear localization in tubular cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of BK virus-associated nephropathy combined with hydronephrosis that was diagnosed by biopsy in a patient with AIDS. "
1084,0.005,1.0000,"The natural ligands for the CCR5 chemokine receptor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), MIP-1beta, and RANTES (regulated on T-cell activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted), are known to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry, and N-terminally modified RANTES analogues are more potent than native RANTES in blocking infection. However, potent CCR5 blocking agents may select for HIV-1 variants that use alternative coreceptors at less than fully inhibitory concentrations. In this study, two N-terminal chemical modifications of RANTES produced by total synthesis, aminooxypentane (AOP)-RANTES[2-68] and N-nonanoyl (NNY)-RANTES[2-68], were tested for their ability to prevent HIV-1 infection and to select for coreceptor switch variants in the human peripheral blood lymphocyte-SCID mouse model. Mice were infected with a CCR5-using HIV-1 isolate that requires only one or two amino acid substitutions to use CXCR4 as a coreceptor. Even though it achieved lower circulating concentrations than AOP-RANTES (75 to 96 pM as opposed to 460 pM under our experimental conditions), NNY-RANTES was more effective in preventing HIV-1 infection. However, in a subset of treated mice, these levels of NNY-RANTES rapidly selected viruses with mutations in the V3 loop of envelope that altered coreceptor usage. These results reinforce the case for using agents that block all significant HIV-1 coreceptors for effective therapy."

Sera from slow progressors reacted more strongly with short envelope peptides modeling gp160NL4-3, predominantly in gp41. Reactivity to six peptides (in constant regions C3, C4, and C5 of gp120 and in gp41) correlated with slower progression. In a novel association, reactivity to three peptides (in constant regions C1 and C3 and variable region V3 of gp120) correlated with faster progression. Envelope peptide reactivity correlated with subsequent course of disease progression as strongly as did reactivity to gag p24. Patients heterozygous for 32-bp deletions in the CCR5 coreceptor reacted more frequently to an epitope in gp41. Rapid progressors had greater gp120 native-to-denatured binding ratios than did slow progressors. While antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against gp120 did not strongly differentiate the groups, slow progressors showed a broader neutralization pattern against 5 primary virus isolates."
706,0.005,1.0000,"We have used an indirect-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to quantitate the reactivity of sera from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected humans with native recombinant gp120 (HIV-1 IIIB or SF-2) or with the gp120 molecule (IIIB or SF-2) denatured by being boiled in the presence of dithiothreitol with or without sodium dodecyl sulfate. Denaturation of IIIB gp120 reduced the titers of sera from randomly selected donors by at least 100-fold, suggesting that the majority of cross-reactive anti-gp120 antibodies present are directed against discontinuous or otherwise conformationally sensitive epitopes. When SF-2 gp120 was used, four of eight serum samples reacted significantly with the denatured protein, albeit with ca. 3- to 50-fold reductions in titer. Only those sera reacting with denatured SF-2 gp120 bound significantly to solid-phase-adsorbed SF-2 V3 loop peptide, and none bound to IIIB V3 loop peptide. Almost all antibody binding to reduced SF-2 gp120 was blocked by preincubation with the SF-2 V3 loop peptide, as was about 50% of the binding to native SF-2 gp120. When sera from a laboratory worker or a chimpanzee infected with IIIB were tested, the pattern of reactivity was reversed, i.e., there was significant binding to reduced IIIB gp120, but not to reduced SF-2 gp120. Binding of these sera to reduced IIIB gp120 was 1 to 10% that to native IIIB gp120 and was substantially decreased by preincubation with IIIB (but not SF-2) V3 loop peptide. To analyze which discontinuous or conformational epitopes were predominant in HIV-1-positive sera, we prebound monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to IIIB gp120 and then added alkaline phosphatase-labelled HIV-1-positive sera. MAbs (such as 15e) that recognize discontinuous epitopes and compete directly with CD4 reduced HIV-1-positive sera binding by about 50%, whereas neutralizing MAbs to the C4, V2, and V3 domains of gp120 were either not inhibitory or only weakly so. Thus, antibodies to the discontinuous CD4-binding site on gp120 are prevalent in HIV-1-positive sera, antibodies to linear epitopes are less common, most of the antibodies to linear epitopes are directed against the V3 region, and most cross-reactive antibodies are directed against discontinuous epitopes, including regions involved in CD4 binding."
2708,0.005,1.0000,"The process of transcriptional activation directed by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) was investigated by in vivo footprinting using ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction in a human epithelial cell line infected with human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6). Infection with both viruses induces a remarkable enhancement in LTR-mediated gene expression that correlates with a change in the pattern of protein binding to the downstream kappa B site of the enhancer region. In HHV-6 infected cells, this change in the genomic footprinting pattern is concomitant with the induction of specific enhancer-binding proteins in the nucleus. The similarity of these events to those detected in other previously investigated experimental systems suggests that the LTR enhancer region is the ultimate target for the induction of the HIV-1 transcriptional response upon stimuli acting through different upstream pathways."
4826,0.005,1.0000,"One of the hallmarks of HIV-1 infection is represented by the finding of massive T cell activation in peripheral blood lymphocytes of infected patients. An impairment of NK cell function during HIV-1 infection is also detected, and is associated with decreased expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR). In this study we tried to determine whether also NK cells are affected by relevant activation and whether this could be associated with decreased NK cell function. In 18 viremic HIV-1-infected patients, freshly drawn purified peripheral NK cells displayed significant levels of activation with an incomplete pattern (HLA-DR(+)CD69(+)CD25(-)NKp44(-)). Activated (HLA-DR(+)CD69(+)) peripheral NK cells expressed an NCR(dull) phenotype as determined by cytofluorometric analysis in all the patients, and did not derive from a homogeneous/oligoclonal expansion in vivo as analyzed by expression of HLA-specific inhibitory NK cell receptors. As determined by cytotoxicity assays, activated NK cells showed a decreased cytolytic function in HIV-1-infected patients. Thus, the decrease in NK cell function observed during HIV-1 infection is associated not only with decreased NCR expression, but also with significant and incomplete NK cell activation in vivo. These results suggest a consistent continuous involvement of the innate immune response in the failure to control viral replication."

Quantification of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA before and after initiation of HBV-active cART in a cohort of 59 HIV-/HBV-coinfected patients was performed. Calculations of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used for the identification of predictors of HBsAg seroclearance for HBeAg-positive [HBeAg(+); n = 36] and HBeAg-negative [HBeAg(-);n = 23] patients. HBeAg(+) patients with an HBsAg on-treatment decline ≥ 1 log IU/mL per year achieved higher HBsAg loss rates (P = 0.0294), whereas the quantification of HBeAg had no predictive value for HBsAg seroclearance. Among HBeAg(-) patients, a pretreatment baseline cut-off level of HBsAg ≤ 100 IU/mL was highly predictive for HBsAg seroclearance. No significant influence of the HBV genotype on HBsAg seroclearance was observed among the entire cohort. Quantitative determination of HBsAg provides a clinically useful viral parameter for the prediction of HBsAg seroclearance both in HBeAg(+) and HBeAg(-) HIV-/HBV-coinfected patients receiving HBV-active cART."

Non-AIDS severe events were defined as a first admission to the hospital due to non-AIDS-defining malignancies, cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, liver-related, or end-stage renal disease events. Potential determinants of non-AIDS/death events were studied using Cox regression models. Eighty-five non-AIDS/death events occurred during 6,062 persons-years of follow-up (PYFU) with a CIR of 1.4 per 100 PYFU. Factors associated with non-AIDS/death event were age (HR 3.4; 95% CI: 1.6-6.9), nadir CD4 below 350 cells/mm³ (HR 2.5; 95% CI: 1.4-4.6), and a last determination of viral load above the median (HR 1.9; 95% CI: 1.0-3.3). The CIR of non-AIDS/death events was 2.1 and 1.8 per 100 PYFU before and after cART in patients who started cART (n=446). A reduction of CIR of non-AIDS events after cART initiation was observed only in patients with a nadir of CD4 above 350 cells/mm³ (2.5 vs. 0.6 per 100 PYFU, p=0.004, and remained stable after cART in patients with a median nadir of CD4 below 350 cells/mm³. CIR was similar in elite, viremic, and noncontrollers (1.1, 1.0, and 1.5 per 100 PYFU, respectively, p=0.25). Reduction of CIR of non-AIDS events after cART initiation depends on nadir CD4 T cell count. Most of the controllers patients had a CIR similar to noncontrollers. These data support the early initiation of cART in HIV-infected patients."

The variability in the functional domains of BCP and PC region of HBV and their association with disease progression and clinical outcome were assessed in Eastern India, an unique region where three HBV genotypes, A, D, and C are prevalent among the same ethnic group. PCR amplification and direct sequencing of BCP and PC region was done on sera obtained from 130 HBsAg positive subjects with different clinical presentations. Associations of the apparent risk factors with clinical advancement were evaluated by statistical methods including multiple logistic regression analyses (MLR). HBV genotype A was present in 33.08%, C in 25.38%, and D in 41.54% cases. Genotypes A and C were associated with higher rate of T1762/A1764 mutations than the most predominant genotype D. HBeAg negative state was associated with considerably higher rate of C1753 mutation. T1762/A1764 along with C1753 was common among cirrhosis and T1762/A1764 without C1753 was frequent among chronic liver disease cases. No significant association was found between A1896 point mutation and clinical status. Multivariate analysis revealed that T1762/A1764 double mutation, HBV/A, age ≥25 years, C1753 and A1899 were critical factors for clinical advancement while age ≥25 years and C1753 as significant predictor for cirrhosis in comparison with chronic liver disease. In conclusion, the analysis of the BCP variability may help in monitoring the progression towards advanced liver disease in Eastern Indian patients."

2902,0.005,1.0000,"Although co-infection of tuberculosis (TB) and intestinal parasites, including protozoa and helminths, in humans has been widely studied globally, very little of this phenomenon is known in China. Therefore, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural county of China to investigate such co-infections. Patients with pulmonary TB (PTB) undergoing anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis (anti-MTB) treatment were surveyed by questionnaires, and their feces and blood specimens were collected for detection of intestinal protozoa and helminths, routine blood examination and HIV detection. The χ(2) test and multivariate logistic regression model were used to identify risk factors. A total of 369 patients with PTB were included and all of them were HIV negative. Overall, only 7.3% of participants were infected with intestinal protozoa, among which prevalence of Blastocystis hominis, Entamoeba spp. and Trichomonas hominis were 6.0%, 1.1% and 0.3%, respectively; 7.0% were infected with intestinal helminths, among which prevalence of hookworm, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides and Clonorchis sinensis were 4.3%, 1.9%, 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively; and 0.5% were simultaneously infected with intestinal protozoa and helminths. Among patients with PTB, body mass index (BMI)≤18 (OR=3.30, 95% CI=1.44-7.54) and raised poultry or livestock (e.g., chicken, duck, pig) (OR=3.96, 95% CI=1.32-11.89) were significantly associated with harboring intestinal protozoan infection, while BMI≤18 (OR=3.32, 95% CI=1.39-7.91), anemia (OR=3.40, 95% CI=1.44-8.02) and laboring barefoot in farmlands (OR=4.54, 95% CI=1.88-10.92) were significantly associated with having intestinal helminth infection. Additionally, there was no significant relationship between duration of anti-MTB treatment and infection rates of intestinal parasites including protozoa and helminths. Therefore, preventing malnutrition, avoiding unprotected contact with reservoirs of protozoa, and improving health education for good hygiene habits, particularly wearing shoes while outdoors, are beneficial in the prevention of intestinal protozoan and helminth infection among patients with PTB.

1704,0.005,1.0000,"The -1G mutant HBV is more prevalent in individuals co-infected with HIV/HBV than in individuals infected with HBV alone and in some cases is the dominant virus in circulation. This mutant is created by the deletion of a dGMP (-1G) from the guanine rich homopolymer sequence located at nts 2,085-2,090 (numbering from EcoRI site as position 1) in the HBV core gene. This deletion causes a frameshift generating a premature stop codon at (64) Asn in the HBV core gene (codon 93 in the precore gene), that truncates the precore protein, precursor of the secreted hepatitis B ""e"" antigen (HBeAg), and the core protein which forms the viral nucleocapsid. However, the replication phenotype of the -1G mutant HBV is unknown. An in vitro cell culture model in which hepatoma cells were transiently transfected with infectious cDNAs was used to show that the -1G mutant HBV is incapable of autonomous replication and, as expected, replication was restored to wild-type (wt) levels by supplying HBV core protein in trans. Although the -1G mutation had no deleterious effect on intracellular HBV-DNA levels, high levels of -1G mutant HBV relative to wt HBV reduced virus secretion and HBeAg secretion relative to empty vector controls. Importantly, the -1G mutant HBV also caused intracellular retention of truncated precore protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. Together, these effects may be contributing to the increased pathology observed in the setting of HIV/HBV co-infection."
4194,0.005,1.0000,"Rare human immunodeficiency virus 1-infected individuals, termed elite suppressors (ES), maintain plasma virus levels of <50 copies/ml and normal CD4 counts without therapy. The major histocompatibility complex class I allele group human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*57 is overrepresented in this population. Mutations in HLA-B*57-restricted epitopes have been observed in ES, but their significance has remained unclear. Here we investigate the extent and impact of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations in HLA-B*57+ ES. We provide the first direct evidence that most ES experience chronic low level viremia. Sequencing revealed a striking discordance between the genotypes of plasma virus and archived provirus in resting CD4+ T cells. Mutations in HLA-B*57-restricted Gag epitopes were present in all viruses from plasma but were rare in proviruses, suggesting powerful selective pressure acting at these epitopes. Surprisingly, strong CD8+ T cell interferon-gamma responses were detected against some mutant epitopes found in plasma virus, suggesting the development of de novo responses to viral variants. In some individuals, relative CD8+ T cell interleukin-2 responses showed better correlation with the selection observed in vivo. Thus, analysis of low level viremia reveals an unexpectedly high level of CTL escape mutations reflecting selective pressure acting at HLA-B*57-restricted epitopes in ES. Continued viral suppression probably reflects CTL responses against unmutated epitopes and residual or de novo responses against epitopes with escape mutations."
7331,0.005,1.0000,"The vif gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is essential for viral replication, although the functional target of Vif remains elusive. HIV-1 vif mutant virions derived from nonpermissive H9 cells displayed no significant differences in the amount, ratio, or integrity of their protein composition relative to an isogenic wild-type virion. The amounts of the virion-associated viral genomic RNA and tRNA(3)(Lys) were additionally present at normal levels in vif mutant virions. We demonstrate that Vif associates with RNA in vitro as well as with viral genomic RNA in virus-infected cells. A functionally conserved lentivirus Vif motif was found in the double-stranded RNA binding domain of Xenopus laevis, Xlrbpa. The natural intravirion reverse transcriptase products were markedly reduced in vif mutant virions. Moreover, purified vif mutant genomic RNA-primer tRNA complexes displayed severe defects in the initiation of reverse transcription with recombinant reverse transcriptase. These data point to a novel role for Vif in the regulation of efficient reverse transcription through modulation of the virion nucleic acid components."
431,0.005,1.0000,"Human adenovirus E1A oncoprotein activates or represses transcription from a variety of viral and cellular promoters by several complex mechanisms. The E1A products, 289R and 243R, have differential effects on transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR). Previous reports indicate that repression of HIV-1 LTR-directed gene expression by E1A 243R is mediated through the kappa B enhancer elements located between nucleotides -105 and -82 relative to the transcription initiation start site (+1). Results from this study suggest a novel mechanism for transcriptional repression of the HIV-1 LTR by E1A 243R that is enhancer-independent and that is mediated through basal HIV-1 promoter elements. Transient expression assays, in which 5'-truncated or site-directed mutant HIV-1 LTR-CAT reporters were tested for their response to repression mediated by wild-type or mutant 243R, demonstrate that LTR sequences upstream of -31 relative to the transcription initiation start site (+1) and inclusive of the enhancer elements are dispensable for 243R-mediated repression. The ability of 243R to repress HIV-1 basal promoter activity requires both an intact N-terminus of E1A 243R and the TATA element within the HIV-1 promoter. These results support a novel mechanism for E1A 243R-induced transcriptional repression that is enhancer-independent and that targets directly the general transcription machinery."
9314,0.005,1.0000,"Trans-dominant negative mutants of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Rev inhibit the function of wild-type Rev in a dose-dependent manner. This was previously shown to be caused by nuclear retention of the wild-type protein. In the present work, further analysis of the trans-dominant negative effect was performed using cotransfection experiments with different constructs encoding HIV-1 Rev and viral structural proteins together with a plasmid encoding a trans-dominant negative Rev mutant. Thus, one species of pre-mRNA was transcribed from the reporter plasmids. This pre-mRNA was then either spliced or exported by Rev as unspliced RNA for translation of the HIV structural proteins. An immunofluorescence assay and Western blot analysis were used for analysis of protein expression. In situ hybridization was applied for labelling of unspliced mRNA in transfected cells, and RNase protection analysis was used to determine the relative amount of unspliced versus spliced mRNAs. The experiments confirmed that the transdominant negative mutant inhibited nuclear export of unspliced mRNA. It was, in addition, demonstrated for the first time that the trans-dominant negative mutant also affected a Rev-dependent regulatory step connected with viral pre-mRNA splicing. As a consequence, proteins expressed from unspliced and singly spliced HIV mRNAs decreased while there was an increase in protein products encoded by spliced and alternatively spliced mRNAs."

Because of their potential significance for the outcome of infection with this virus, we have studied the relative prevalence of NAs, ADCC antibodies, and IEAs in the sera of patients infected with HIV. Our results demonstrate that while >or=60% of serum samples are positive for NAs or ADCC antibodies, 72% of these serum samples mediate the enhancement of infection in the presence of complement. In patients with low CD4 counts, NA and ADCC antibody levels tend to decrease, while IEA levels increase. A significant positive correlation was found only between the presence of ADCC antibodies and the presence of antibodies that neutralized HIV-1 in the presence of complement. These results show that the anti-HIV-1 humoral immune response consists of a mixture of antibodies that may inhibit or enhance HIV infection and whose ratios may vary in different stages of the infection."
4153,0.005,1.0000,"The Vif protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is important for virion infectivity. Previous studies have shown that vif-defective virions exhibit structural abnormalities in the virus core and are defective in the ability to complete proviral DNA synthesis in acutely infected cells. We developed novel assays to assess the relative stability of the core in HIV-1 virions. Using these assays, we examined the role of Vif in the stability of the HIV-1 core. The integrity of the core was examined following virion permeabilization or removal of the lipid envelope and treatment with various triggers, including S100 cytosol, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, detergents, NaCl, and buffers of different pH to mimic aspects of the uncoating and disassembly process which occurs after virus entry but preceding or during reverse transcription. vif mutant cores were more sensitive to disruption by all triggers tested than wild-type cores, as determined by endogenous reverse transcriptase (RT) assays, biochemical analyses, and electron microscopy. RT and the p7 nucleocapsid protein were released more readily from vif mutant virions than from wild-type virions, suggesting that the internal nucleocapsid is less stably packaged in the absence of Vif. Purified cores could be isolated from wild-type but not vif mutant virions by sedimentation through detergent-treated gradients. These results demonstrate that Vif increases the stability of virion cores. This may permit efficient viral DNA synthesis by preventing premature degradation or disassembly of viral nucleoprotein complexes during early events after virus entry."

To examine the clinical features and course after emergence of YMDD mutants, 55 patients who received lamivudine therapy over 104 weeks at our unit were assayed for YMDD mutation(s). Thirty-two of them were found to have the YMDD mutation. They continued lamivudine therapy and were followed up weekly or biweekly if clinically indicated. Thirty (93.7%) of them showed elevation of alanine transaminase (ALT), and 13 (40.6%) experienced acute exacerbation at 4 to 94 weeks (median, 24 weeks) after emergence of the YMDD mutant. The incidence of exacerbation is much higher than 4.3% in patients without the YMDD mutation (P =.003). Compared with patients without exacerbation, patients with exacerbation had a significantly higher serum HBV-DNA level after emergence of the YMDD mutant (P <.005). Before exacerbation, serum HBV-DNA level was rising to its peak, followed by the peaking of ALT (247-2,010 U/L) 1 to 4 weeks later. Three patients developed hepatic decompensation, but then in association with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion, recovered. Of the 12 evaluable patients, 8 (75%) showed HBeAg seroconversion, and 3 showed mutant clearance within 1 to 5 months after exacerbation. In contrast, none of the patients without exacerbation showed HBeAg seroconversion (P <.001). These results indicate that acute exacerbations may occur after emergence of the YMDD mutation. The incidence, clinicopathological features, and subsequent course, and possibly the underlying immune mechanisms, are similar to those of wild-type HBV chronic infection.

The PBS mutant proviral DNA was characterized by transfection of the viral DNA into CD4+ and non-CD4+ target cells. The results indicate that mutation in the PBS reduced the level of viral particles released into the medium of transfected cells in comparison to wild-type proviral DNA. The viral particles were noninfectious upon transmission to established CD4+ cell lines and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Electron microscopic analysis of the transfected cells revealed no abnormalities in the structure of the virion directed by the mutant proviral DNA. Also, the protein and RNA contents of the mutant virions were similar to the wild type. The quantitation of intracellular viral structural protein in the transfected cells, however, indicated that the PBS mutation may have an effect on the assembly of viral particles in addition to completely abolishing reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA. These results provide evidence that the PBS region of the viral genome has multiple functions in HIV-1 replication."
4098,0.005,1.0000,"Although highly active antiretroviral therapy has improved survivorship dramatically and decreased the incidence of cytomegalovirus retinitis among patients with AIDS, other ophthalmic complications continue to occur. One complication observed in approximately 12% of HIV-infected patients is a presumed neuroretinal disorder (NRD), manifested as decreased contrast sensitivity and associated with vague subjective complaints of hazy vision. Pathologically, patients with AIDS even without ocular opportunistic infections have loss of optic nerve axons, suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction. We explored whether variation in mitochondrial DNA was associated with time to NRD in HIV-infected patients in the Longitudinal Study of Ocular Complications of AIDS cohort. Within the Western European, or ""N"", mitochondrial DNA macrohaplogroup, haplogroup J, was associated with 80% decrease in the risk of progression to NRD during the study (hazard ratio = 0.20, P = 0.039) and suggested an independent association with protection against NRD in a cross-section of all patients taken at enrollment (1.5% vs. 8.9% in patients with vs. without haplogroup J, respectively, P = 0.05). These data suggest that mitochondrial genotype may influence propensity to develop HIV-associated NRD in patients with AIDS."
3814,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with HIV infection often complain of cognitive disturbances, which can be related to AIDS dementia or HIV-associated encephalopathy (HIVE). We investigated the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in comparison with other therapeutic regimens on the progression of these cognitive disturbances as measured by visual event-related potentials (ERP). In a cross-sectional study, 214 patients without secondary neuromanifestation of their infection were divided into four groups with respect to their treatment status for 1 year before examination: (1) without antiretroviral treatment, (2) zidovudine monotherapy, (3) zidovudine in combination with didanosine, zalcitabine, or lamivudine, and (4) HAART. In a prospective longitudinal study, we divided 54 patients into three groups: (1) without antiretroviral treatment, (2) zidovudine monotherapy, and (3) HAART. Latencies of the P2, N2, and P3 components and the amplitude of the P3 component were evaluated. A significant negative correlation between CD4(+) lymphocyte cell count and P3 latency was found in all patients (p < 0.004). In the cross-sectional study, P3 latency was significantly decreased in the HAART group as compared with patients with no antiretroviral treatment (p < 0.01). During the 1-year period of the prospective longitudinal study, the P3 latency significantly increased in patients with no antiretroviral treatment (p < 0.05) and significantly decreased in patients with HAART (p < 0.05). In summary, these results suggest that HAART has an improving therapeutic effect on cognitive processing in HIV-infected patients and is superior to zidovudine monotherapy or dual antiretroviral treatment. Because prolongation of ERP might in part reflect HIVE, we conclude that this condition represents an indication for HAART."

6955,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has fundamentally changed the clinical outcome of HIV infection and AIDS. However, the emergence of drug-resistant HIV variants is a barrier to successful use of HAART, with resistance to one drug often resulting in cross-resistance to many, if not all, others in the same class. The rise in the incidence of drug-resistant variants among newly infected patients also represents a formidable challenge for clinicians. Failure of the current HAART regimen due to drug resistance can severely limit second-line, third-line, and salvage treatment options. Although inadequate exposure of the virus to antiretroviral agents is a prime reason for the emergence of HIV drug-resistant variants, poor adherence to complicated regimens and variability in drug pharmacokinetics (PK), both within and between HIV-infected individuals, can also affect the overall efficacy of antiretroviral agents, promoting emergence of resistant HIV variants. Recent strategies to optimize antiretroviral drug regimens, including assessment of HIV genotype and/or phenotype, the use of protease inhibitor regimens that incorporate PK boosting, and scheduled treatment interruptions, have been explored. Additionally, several newer antiretroviral agents that produce rapid and sustained virologic and immunologic responses as well as novel resistance profiles (e.g. atazanavir and tenofovir) have become available. These characteristics thus increase the likelihood of durable viral suppression."
342,0.005,1.0000,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes the majority of oropharyngeal cancers in the United States, yet the risk factors for and natural history of oral HPV infection are largely unknown. In 2010-2011, a US-based longitudinal cohort study of 761 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and 469 at-risk HIV-uninfected participants from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and the Women's Interagency HIV Study was initiated. Semiannually collected oral rinses were evaluated for 37 HPV genotypes using the Roche LINEAR ARRAY HPV Genotyping Test (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, California), and factors associated with oral HPV incidence and clearance were explored using adjusted Wei-Lin-Weissfeld modeling. Through 2013, the 2-year cumulative incidence of any type of oral HPV infection was 34% in HIV-infected persons and 19% in HIV-uninfected persons. However, many of these infections cleared. Seven percent of incident infections and 35% of prevalent infections persisted for at least 2 years. After adjustment for other risk factors, HIV infection (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.7, 3.2), reduced current CD4 cell count, and increased numbers of oral sex and ""rimming"" partners increased the risk of incident oral HPV infection, whereas male sex, older age, and current smoking increased the risk of oral HPV persistence (each P < 0.05). This helps explain the consistent associations observed between these factors and prevalent oral HPV infection in previous cross-sectional studies. "

801,0.005,1.0000,"Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is recognised as an important component of collaborative tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activities to reduce the burden of TB in people living with HIV (PLHIV). However, there has been little in the way of IPT implementation at country level. This failure has resulted in a recent call to arms under the banner title of the 'Three I's' (infection control to prevent nosocomial transmission of TB in health care settings, intensified TB case finding and IPT). In this paper, we review the background of IPT. We then discuss the important challenges of IPT in PLHIV, namely responsibility and accountability for the implementation, identification of latent TB infection, exclusion of active TB and prevention of isoniazid resistance, length of treatment and duration of protective efficacy. We also highlight several research questions that currently remain unanswered. We finally offer practical suggestions about how to scale up IPT in the field, including the need to integrate IPT into a package of care for PLHIV, the setting up of operational projects with the philosophy of 'learning while doing', the development of flow charts for eligibility for IPT, the development and implementation of care prior to antiretroviral treatment, and finally issues around procurement, distribution, monitoring and evaluation. We support the implementation of IPT, but only if it is done in a safe and structured way. There is a definite risk that 'sloppy' IPT will be inefficient and, worse, could lead to the development of multidrug-resistant TB, and this must be avoided at all costs."

Existing control strategies are unlikely to curtail these diseases in the absence of efficacious vaccines. Testing of HIV and malaria vaccines candidates start with early phase trials that are increasingly being conducted in developing countries where the burden of the diseases is high. Unique challenges, which affect planning and implementation of vaccine trials according to internationally accepted standards have thus been identified. In this review, we highlight specific challenges encountered during two early phase trials of novel HIV-1 and malaria vectored vaccine candidates conducted in The Gambia and how some of these issues were pragmatically addressed. We hope our experience will be useful for key study personnel involved in day-to-day running of similar clinical trials. It may also guide future design and implementation of vaccine trials in resource-constrained settings."
2896,0.005,1.0000,"The implementation of hepatitis C (HCV) direct-acting antiviral drugs is prioritized in several populations in which its application provides the most immediate and impactful benefit. In this scenario, a precise knowledge of the situation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV chronic co-infection is required to adequately address this disease. This cross-sectional study was performed in 21 hospitals in Andalusia (Spain). The study population consisted of HIV-infected patients with an active HCV chronic infection who were not receiving HCV treatment at the time of inclusion. A total of 13,506 HIV-infected patients were included in the study. Of them, 2561 (18.9 %) presented chronic HCV infection. The majority of the patients included were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART; 96.2 %), showed plasma levels with an undetectable HIV viral load (92.5 %), and had a good immunological status (median CD4+ cell count of 486 cells/mL). The HCV genotype distribution was as follows: 58.1 % were genotype 1, 1.1 % were genotype 2, 16.1 % were genotype 3, and 22.1 % were genotype 4 (2.6 % were missing data). In total, 24.8 % of the patients showed liver fibrosis stage F0-F1, 27.9 % showed stage F2, 16.7 % showed stage F3, and 21 % showed stage F4 (9.6 % were missing data). With regards to previous HCV treatment experiences, 68.05 % of the patients were naïve and 31.95 % had failed to respond to a previous treatment. The burden of HCV/HIV co-infected patients in our population was reported as one in five HIV-infected patients requiring HCV treatment. The implementation of extra resources to face this important health challenge is mandatory. "
8585,0.005,1.0000,"Homeless youth are at increased risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HBV vaccine coverage is poor in this group. The purpose of our study was to determine if a shelter-based HBV vaccine program in children and adolescents 2-18 years of age with a randomized controlled trial using a culturally appropriate HBV video could increase HBV vaccine coverage rates. Subjects were randomized to an 8 min HBV video or a control, smoking prevention video. Before exposure to the videos, HBV knowledge, and demographics were assessed in caregivers and adolescents. HBV vaccine no. 1 was offered to all subjects who did not produce a vaccine record; subsequently, an accurate HBV vaccine history was obtained from medical providers. Subjects were asked to return 1 and 3 months after visit 1, HBV vaccine was offered to all with incomplete coverage, and HBV knowledge was reassessed. There were 328 children and adolescents cared for by 170 caregivers enrolled in the study. One hundred and four had incomplete HBV vaccine coverage. Data are reported for all family units with at least one subject needing vaccine. There were 53 children and adolescents randomized to the HBV video vs. 51 to the smoking video. HBV knowledge scores of caregivers improved at Visit no. 2 vs. no. 1 in the HBV video group (p = 0.01) but not in the smoking group (p = 0.82). Similar results were observed for adolescents in the HBV video group (p = 0.05) but not in the smoking group (p = 0.40). Exposure to the HBV video vs the smoking video had a significant effect on return rates for vaccine at Visit no. 2 (59 vs. 31%; p = 0.05) but not at Visit no. 3 (47 vs. 18%, p = 0.06). The shelter-based vaccine program was very effective in increasing HBV coverage rates in the entire group of 328 children and adolescents enrolled in the study, from 68% coverage at baseline to 85% at the conclusion of the study. We conclude that shelter-based HBV vaccine programs can be highly effective in increasing vaccine coverage rates in older children and adolescents. A brief exposure to a culturally appropriate HBV video improves HBV knowledge and may improve return rates for vaccine."
990,0.005,1.0000,"Background/Aims HIV continues to be a major public health threat in the United States, and mathematical modeling has demonstrated that the universal effective use of antiretroviral therapy among all HIV-positive individuals (i.e. the ""test and treat"" approach) has the potential to control HIV. However, to accomplish this, all the steps that define the HIV care continuum must be achieved at high levels, including HIV testing and diagnosis, linkage to and retention in clinical care, antiretroviral medication initiation, and adherence to achieve and maintain viral suppression. The HPTN 065 (Test, Link-to-Care Plus Treat [TLC-Plus]) study was designed to determine the feasibility of the ""test and treat"" approach in the United States. Methods HPTN 065 was conducted in two intervention communities, Bronx, NY, and Washington, DC, along with four non-intervention communities, Chicago, IL; Houston, TX; Miami, FL; and Philadelphia, PA. The study consisted of five components: (1) exploring the feasibility of expanded HIV testing via social mobilization and the universal offer of testing in hospital settings, (2) evaluating the effectiveness of financial incentives to increase linkage to care, (3) evaluating the effectiveness of financial incentives to increase viral suppression, (4) evaluating the effectiveness of a computer-delivered intervention to decrease risk behavior in HIV-positive patients in healthcare settings, and (5) administering provider and patient surveys to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding the use of antiretroviral therapy for prevention and the use of financial incentives to improve health outcomes. The study used observational cohorts, cluster and individual randomization, and made novel use of the existing national HIV surveillance data infrastructure. All components were developed with input from a community advisory board, and pragmatic methods were used to implement and assess the outcomes for each study component. Results A total of 76 sites in Washington, DC, and the Bronx, NY, participated in the study: 37 HIV test sites, including 16 hospitals, and 39 HIV care sites. Between September 2010 and December 2014, all study components were successfully implemented at these sites and resulted in valid outcomes. Our pragmatic approach to the study design, implementation, and the assessment of study outcomes allowed the study to be conducted within established programmatic structures and processes. In addition, it was successfully layered on the ongoing standard of care and existing data infrastructure without disrupting health services. Conclusion The HPTN 065 study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a multi-component ""test and treat"" trial that included a large number of community sites and involved pragmatic approaches to study implementation and evaluation."

464,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem, with more than 350 million people chronically infected worldwide. The chronic HBV infection in Poland is also an essential medical and social problem. Starting from 1993, a steady decline of the incidence of HBV has been observed, reaching the estimated rate of 4.5 per 100 000 in 2004. Nothing is known about the genetic variability of HBV in Poland, the occurrence and spreading of genetic variants and mutants of hepatitis B virus in the population of Polish patients during the course of the disease and in relation to antiviral treatment. It is very interesting to study the molecular epidemiology of the Polish population regarding hepatitis B virus infection as Poland is still ethnically a uniform country, with no more than 3-4% of ethnic minorities. The first results regarding distribution of HBV genotypes and serotypes in northern Poland have been published by our group in 2003 and 2004. This work was part of a scientific project supported by the Fifth Framework Programme initiative of the European Union, entitled ""Emerging variants of hepatitis B virus: new tools for epidemiological survey, diagnosis of infection, and monitoring of drug resistance"". In the course of the project more than 200 hepatitis B infected patients from the northern part of Poland have been enrolled, diagnosed and - if the viral load of HBV was suitable for analysis - genotyped by sequencing of the HBV pol/S gene fragment. This review presents the main characteristics and some interesting aspects of the studied cohort of chronically infected patients from northern Poland as well as the molecular epidemiology."
5393,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. The etiology of liver cancer is multifactorial, and infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), whose pathogenesis is exacerbated by the acquisition of mutations that accelerate carcinogenesis, or hepatitis C virus (HCV) and dietary exposure to aflatoxin B(1) all contribute to elevating one's risk for this disease. In this study, we sought to determine the contributions of these agents by measuring the occurrence of an HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) double mutation, an aflatoxin-specific 249(G-->T) mutation of the p53 gene, and HCV in plasma of 34 HCC cases and 68 age- and gender-matched controls, and in 25 liver tumors from northern Thailand. In total, 14 cases, 5 controls, and 19 tumors had detectable levels of HBV DNA. All 14 cases, 2 controls (2.9%), and 17 tumors (89.5%) were positive for the HBV double mutation. Nine cases (26.5%), 10 controls (14.7%), and 6 tumors (24%) were positive for the p53 mutation. Five cases (14.7%), no controls, and 4 tumors (16%) had both mutations. The median age of HCC diagnosis in these 5 cases was 34 years versus 51 years for other cases. Five cases (14.7%) and 1 control (1.5%) were HCV enzyme immunoassay positive. Thus, specific HBV, HCV, and aflatoxin biomarkers reveal the complexity of risks contributing to HCC in northern Thailand and suggest further application of these biomarkers as intermediate end points in prevention, intervention trials, and etiologic investigations."
8416,0.005,1.0000,Sera from 65 patients with primary liver carcinoma (PLC) and 69 sex- and age-matched controls were examined for Hepatitis B virus markers. Forty two of the patients (65%) and 25 controls (36%) were HBsAg positive. Anti-HBc was demonstrated in over 80% and in 84% of the study groups respectively. Over 70% of hepatitis B infection was anicteric and traditional surgical intervention correlated with prevalence of PLC. The data provide support for the etiological role of HBV in Nigerian patients with PLC; this is the first report that the incidence of PLC is highest in the northern Savannah region of Nigeria.
8741,0.005,1.0000,"To assess the clinical, immunological and virological evolution in HIV-1 infected patients with CD4 T-cell count above 500/mm3, a historical cohort of 202 untreated and 96 patients treated with HAART was longitudinally studied (median follow-up 36 months). Fourteen untreated and 2 treated patients experienced clinical progression (p = 0.09). The difference between baseline CD4 T-cell count and after 3 years, was -240/mm3 in the untreated group +19/mm3 in the HAART group (p < 10(-3)). A better immunological outcome was significantly associated with a HIV sexual contamination (p = 0.01), HAART (p = 0.01), high baseline CD4 T-cell count (p < 10(-3)) and low baseline HIV viral load (p = 0.01). In the HAART group, the incidence rate of antiretroviral modification due to tolerance difficulties was 0.23+/-0.36/patient year. A sustained undetectable HIV viral load was correlated with a low baseline HIV viral load (p = 0.003) and to be antiretroviral naive (p < 10(-3)). Thus, HAART provide a better immunological outcome in patients with high CD4 T-cell count. However, the CD4 decay slope after 3 years, the risk of therapeutic side-effects and the low risk of clinical progression do not support systematic treatment of those patients."

Seven patients were diagnosed with HCC. The patients were subgrouped into cirrhotic versus noncirrhotic liver cohorts. Among renal allograft recipients with HBV infection, patients with cirrhotic livers had a higher risk of HCC (P = .003) and mortality (P = .025) than those with a noncirrhotic liver. The outcome was poor among the cirrhotic liver group. Pretransplantation liver biopsy may be indicated for the recipient candidate with HBV infection. Liver cirrhosis may be an exclusion criterion for the renal transplant waiting list due to the high incidence of HCC and the poor patient survival."

The 12-month CD4(+) cell count responses were divided into 5 categories, ranging from decrease or no change (29% of patients) to a > or =100-cell/mm(3) increase (27% of patients). There was a lower risk of clinical progression for each incremental increase in CD4(+) cell count response.

Peripheral blood iNKT cells from HIV-1+ and TB patients had significantly increased expression of CD69, CD38, HLA-DR, CD16, CD56, and CD62L. The expression of CD25 was significantly increased only on iNKT cells from TB patients. These findings indicate that peripheral blood iNKT cells in these two chronic infections show an up-regulated expression of activation markers, suggesting their role in the immune response to infection."
4756,0.005,1.0000,"A number of hematologic abnormalities, including cytopenias, have been observed in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. To elucidate their mechanisms, primitive cells from bone marrow aspirates of 21 patients with HIV-1 infection were quantitated by flow cytometry. The mean percentage of CD34+ cells is not significantly altered in HIV-1-infected patients in comparison with HIV-1-seronegative controls. In contrast, two- and three-color immunofluorescence analysis showed that in all HIV-1 samples, most CD34+ cells coexpressed the CD38 antigen. The proportion of HIV-1-derived CD34+ cells that did not express the CD38 antigen was significantly lower (HIV-1+: mean, 1.73%; controls: mean, 14%; P < .0005) than in controls. Moreover, of Thy-1+ cells, the proportion of CD34+ cells was twofold lower in HIV-1-infected patients (HIV-1+: mean, 12%; controls, 25%, P < .0005), which suggests that phenotypically primitive cells are depleted in HIV-1 infection. In vitro functional analysis in long-term cultures of sorted CD34+ cells from seven HIV-1 patients showed that CD34+ cells from HIV-1 patients generated much fewer colonies both in the nonadherent and adherent layers than CD34+ cells from controls after 5 weeks of culture (10-fold and four-fold less, respectively). Precise long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) frequency in the CD34+ cell population was determined in three patients by limiting dilution and was markedly decreased in comparison to that of normal controls (from twofold to > sevenfold decreased). To determine if primitive cells were infected by HIV-1, both methylcellulose colonies generated from long-term culture of CD34+ cells and various CD34+ cell fractions purified by flow cytometry were evaluated for the presence of HIV-1 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Progeny from long-term culture was HIV-1-negative in three samples. In addition, using a sensitive PCR technique, the HIV-1 genome could not be detected in CD34+, CD34+/CD38-, and CD34+/CD4+ cells. These data show that hematologic disorders in HIV disease may be the consequence of a deficit of primitive cells. However, direct infection of these cells by HIV-1 does not seem to be responsible for this defect."
4192,0.005,1.0000,"Between May, 1983 and September, 1987, 8 per cent of the patients hospitalised for an HIV infection (i.e. 30 patients, 20 with an ARC and 10 with AIDS) had tuberculosis. The percentage of patients originating from Central Africa or Haiti was important (23 per cent). Tuberculosis was thoracic (76 per cent) and/or extrathoracic (63 per cent). The main organs involved were the lungs (n = 21), the mediastinal lymph nodes (n = 9), the superficial lymph nodes (n = 9), and the liver (n = 8). The pulmonary infection was often multilobar (n = 14), but without caverns. The tuberculin PPD (purified protein derived) test was positive in 63 per cent of ARC patients and in 30 per cent of AIDS patients. The diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed in 27/30 patients by culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 23) and/or histology (n = 13), and in the remaining patients by response to a specific treatment. In 3 patients with normal X-ray film of the chest, M. tuberculosis could be recovered by culture of the gastric fluid. Antituberculous treatment was effective, but its optimum duration is to be determined since relapse may occur, even after one year of treatment. The side-effects of the treatment were unusually frequent (54 per cent). The occurrence of tuberculosis seemed to aggravate the prognosis of the HIV disease, since 57 per cent of the ARC patients reached the stage of AIDS within 6 months on average. These results are in agreement with the new recommendations of the Centers for disease control which include extrapulmonary tuberculosis in the AIDS criteria. However, in our study, pulmonary tuberculosis had the same detrimental effect and should therefore be included in the AIDS criteria."

We show that whereas there was evidence of detectable levels of cell-associated IL-8 (mRNA and protein) in peripheral cells of healthy individuals, this was largely lost in the disease states studied. Coupled with this finding was significantly increased circulating levels of IL-8 in HIV-1-infected individuals with or without concomitant pulmonary TB (P < 0.001). On the other hand, the capacity of peripheral mononuclear cells to produce IL-8 spontaneously ex vivo was enhanced in HIV-1 and TB patients (P < 0.05) and many of the HIV/TB group, but their corresponding capacities to respond to various stimuli, in particular phytohemagglutinin, were significantly diminished compared to those of normal donors (P < 0.05). Circulating levels of IL-8 in a group of HIV/TB patients were significantly positively correlated with the percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the peripheral circulation (r = 0.65; P = 0.01), the proportions of IL-8 receptor A (IL-8RA)-expressing (r = 0.86; P < 0.01) and IL-8RB-expressing (r = 0.77; P < 0.01) PMN, and the capacity of PMN to migrate in response to IL-8 as chemoattractant (r = 0.68; P < 0. 01). IL-8RB fluorescence intensity, however, was negatively correlated with plasma IL-8 levels (r = -0.73; P < 0.01). Our results suggest that altered regulation of IL-8 in HIV-1 may have important implications for antimicrobial defenses and for normal immune processes."
282,0.005,1.0000,"Global human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) diversity may require engineering vaccines to express antigens representing strains prevalent in the target population of vaccine testing. The majority (90%) of incident infections in Thailand are genetic subtype E, with a small percentage of subtype B infections in the intravenous drug user populations. We have evaluated and compared the binding and HIV-1 neutralizing properties of serum antibodies induced in baboons by CHO cell-expressed monomeric gp120 derived from a CCR5-using (R5) subtype E primary HIV-1CM235 or a CXCR4-using (X4) subtype B T-cell line-adapted (TCLA) HIV-1SF2 isolate. In contrast to the subtype-specific HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies induced with recombinant HIV-1SF2 gp120 (rgp120SF2), rgp120CM235 immunization induced antibodies capable of neutralizing both subtype E and subtype B TCLA HIV-1 isolates. However, neither immunogen induced antibodies capable of neutralizing primary HIV-1 isolates. Antibody induced by rgp120CM235 preferentially bound natively folded gp120 and retained strong cross-reactivity against multiple gp120 strains within subtype E as well as subtype B. In contrast, antibody responses to rgp120SF2 were directed predominantly to linear epitopes poorly exposed on native gp120 and had more limited cross-recognition of divergent gp120. Fine epitope mapping revealed differences in antibody specificities. While both rgp120CM235 and rgp120SF2 induced antibodies to regions within C1, V1/V2, V3, and C5, unique responses were induced by rgp120CM235 to multiple epitopes within C2 and by rgp120SF2 to multiple epitopes within C3, V4, and C4. These data demonstrate that strain and/or phenotypic differences of HIV-1 subunit gp120 immunogens can substantially alter antibody binding specificities and subsequent HIV-1 neutralizing capacity."
9954,0.005,1.0000,"We show that at least half of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) have circulating CD8(+) T cells specific for epitopes derived from cytomegalovirus (CMV) and/or the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Compared to healthy age-matched subjects, more CD8(+) T cells in CVID patients were committed to CMV. Despite previous reports of defects in antigen presentation and cellular immunity in CVID, specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells produced interferon (IFN)-gamma after stimulation with CMV peptides, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells secreted perforin in response to these antigens. In CVID patients we found an association between a high percentage of circulating CD8(+) CD57(+) T cells containing perforin, CMV infection and a low CD4/CD8 ratio, suggesting that CMV may have a major role in the T cell abnormalities described previously in this disease. We also show preliminary evidence that CMV contributes to the previously unexplained severe enteropathy that occurs in about 5% of patients."
3229,0.005,1.0000,"The decline in the number of CD4+ T cells in HIV-1-infected patients is known to be related to the increased number of CD8+CD28- T cells. In this paper, we show that CD8+CD28- T cells from HIV-positive patients have an impaired capability to interact with human endothelial cells. This is due to the dramatic expansion, within this subset, of rare CD11b- cells lacking cell-cell adhesion functions. In 50 HIV-positive patients, 19.5% +/- 6.5% of all T cells were CD8+CD28-CD11b-, whereas only 0.8% +/- 0.4% of all T cells from healthy donors showed this uncommon phenotype. The percentage of circulating CD8+CD28-CD11b- T cells was strongly related to the percentage of CD4+ T cells (r = -0.82). This population is peculiar in terms of HIV infection and was found to possess some characteristics associated with effector functions but its cytotoxic properties were impaired. The percentage of target cells lysed by CD8+CD28-CD11b- was significantly lower than that of cells lysed by its CD11b- counterpart (p <.05) both at low (5:1) or at relatively high (20:1) effector/target ratios. CD8+CD28-CD11b- T cells, which lack the ability to interact with endothelial cells, are likely to accumulate and persist in circulation. The biologic properties of CD8+CD28-CD11b- T cells suggest that these cells might be endstage or aberrant differentiated effector cells. Lack of cell-cell adhesion and impaired cytolytic functions favor the hypothesis of a role for CD8+CD28-CD11b- T cells in the development of immunodeficiency."

We conducted a prospective observational study of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected immigrants who visited the Infectious Diseases Department of the Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain, during June 2010-May 2011. Screening of the most prevalent tropical diseases (intestinal parasitosis, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis) was performed according to geographic origin. A total of 190 patients were included: 141 (74.2%) from Latin America, 41 (21.6%) from sub-Saharan Africa, and 8 (4.2%) from northern Africa. Overall, 36.8% (70 of 190) of the patients had at least one positive result for any parasitic disease: 5 patients with positive Trypanosoma cruzi serology, 11 patients with positive Schistosoma mansoni serology, 35 patients with positive Strongyloides stercoralis serology, 7 patients with positive Leishmania infantum serology, intestinal parasitosis were detected in 37 patients, malaria was diagnosed in one symptomatic patient. We propose a screening and management strategy of latent parasitic infections in immigrant patients infected with HIV."
5880,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to examine the relationships among diarrhea, CD4+ cell counts and opportunistic protozoa in HIV-infected patients in North India. In a retrospective study, blood and stool samples of 200 HIV-infected patients from March 2001 until 2003, submitted to the AIDS division of National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), were analyzed. Each patient was examined for opportunistic protozoa, HIV-1 status and CD4+ cell counts, and screened for diarrheal symptoms. The rate of diarrhea was 38% in the stool examination. In HIV-infected patients in the groups CD4+ > 500 cells/microL, 200 cells/microL < CD4+ < 500 cells/muL and in the AIDS patients CD4+ < 200 cells/microL, diarrhea was 14.7, 29.8 and 56.1%, respectively. It is clear that the diarrhea in the AIDS patients was significant compared with the two former groups (P < 0.0005). In the AIDS patients CD4+ < 200 cells/microL with diarrhea, Cryptosporidium infection was, at 56.5%, the highest and statistically significant compared with the other parasites (P = 0.037). Microsporidium was detected in 30.4% of the AIDS patients. Diarrhea was common and most strongly associated in patients with low CD4+ cell counts. The data stress the importance of opportunistic protozoa in the HIV-infected patients, and that opportunistic protozoa should be expected in HIV-infected patients with low CD4+ and diarrhea."

The unexpected clinical and laboratory stabilization of our patient paralleled a progressive increase in his peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (range 410-825 cells/mL) and a relatively controlled HIV viraemia (5970-44,000 HIV-RNA copies/mL). Such a recovery of sufficient immune competency after experiencing four episodes of severe AIDS-associated opportunistic infections, without reliable antiretroviral and antimicrobial support raises several questions."
3388,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at high risk for gastrointestinal infections causing diarrhea, particularly when those infections are parasitic in nature. This propensity is more pronounced in AIDS, where opportunistic parasitic infections may cause severe diarrhea, marked absorptive dysfunction, and significant risk of mortality. There are scant data regarding parasitic infections among HIV patients in the developed world; most studies and research come from povertystricken areas of South Africa, India, Iran, and the South Pacific. Although multiple infections with the same or different parasites have been reported, simultaneous infections are rare. We present the case of a 35-year-old man who developed a co-infection with Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides, simultaneously, the diagnosis being made after the judicious evaluation of a stool sample. Given the associated morbidity, prompt diagnosis and treatment are needed to avoid further complications in patients with HIV. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of triple parasitic infection in a patient with HIV. "
7557,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the pathogenic role of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) among human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons, 111 outpatients with and 68 without diarrhea were evaluated. Examination of stool samples included the HeLa cell adherence assay and an EAggEC polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using primers complementary for the plasmid locus CVD432. The pCVD432 genotype, adherence phenotype, and patient characteristics were correlated with occurrence of diarrhea by multivariate analyses. EAggEC PCR and adherence assays were positive in 7 (6%) and 24 (22%) patients with diarrhea and in 1 (1%) and 21 (31%) asymptomatic control patients, respectively. Clinical manifestations associated with EAggEC PCR-positive isolates were nonspecific; EAggEC infections were independent of CD4 lymphocyte counts. Of the pCVD432 genotype, 5 (71%) of 7 were resistant to cotrimoxazole and ampicillin, and 1 strain was resistant to ciprofloxacin. Overall, pCVD432 PCR-positive E. coli was the most prevalent intestinal organism associated with diarrhea. The adherence assay results did not correlate with diarrhea."
8394,0.005,1.0000,"In many programs providing antiretroviral therapy (ART), clinicians report substantial patient attrition; however, there are no consensus criteria for defining patient loss to follow-up (LTFU). Data on a multisite human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment cohort in Lusaka, Zambia, were used to determine an empirical ""days-late"" definition of LTFU among patients on ART. Cohort members were classified as either ""in care"" or LTFU as of December 31, 2007, according to a range of days-late intervals. The authors then looked forward in the database to determine which patients actually returned to care at any point over the following year. The interval that best minimized LTFU misclassification was described as ""best-performing."" Overall, 33,704 HIV-infected adults on ART were included. Nearly one-third (n = 10,196) were at least 1 day late for an appointment. The best-performing LTFU definition was 56 days after a missed visit, which had a sensitivity of 84.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83.2, 85.0), specificity of 97.5% (95% CI: 97.3, 97.7), and misclassification of 5.1% (95% CI: 4.8, 5.3). The 60-day threshold performed similarly well, with only a marginal difference (<0.1%) in misclassification. This analysis suggests that > or =60 days since the last appointment is a reasonable definition of LTFU. Standardization to empirically derived definitions of LTFU will permit more reliable comparisons within and across programs."
7128,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate its use as a marker of disease severity, serum soluble CD4 (sCD4) was measured by ELISA in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Levels of sCD4 were higher in patients than in controls (P less than .001) but did not increase with disease severity. sCD4 release per CD4 lymphocyte showed a linear increase with disease severity and performed as well as beta 2-microglobulin, a widely used marker. To study the role of sCD4 in the pathogenesis of HIV infection, an ELISA to detect sCD4 complexed with glycoprotein 120 (gp120) HIV envelope protein was developed. Preformed sCD4-gp120 complexes were not detectable in patient serum, but addition of recombinant gp120 showed that circulating sCD4 is capable of binding HIV envelope proteins. This study indicates that the sCD4-to-CD4 lymphocyte ratio increases linearly with disease severity and may be a useful marker of CD4 lymphocyte damage. In addition, serum sCD4 can bind viral particles, which may have implications for the use of recombinant sCD4 as a therapy in HIV infection."
8187,0.005,1.0000,"We examined the prevalence and correlates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) risk behaviors in a large sample of severely mentally ill (SMI) patients. Risk levels were correlated with demographic factors, diagnosis, symptom severity, trauma history, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use disorder (SUD), and sexual orientation. SMI clients from urban and rural settings (N = 275) were assessed regarding HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, and hypothesized risk factors. Patients exhibited substantial levels of risky behavior, particularly sexual risk. Correlates of increased risk included SUD, trauma, male homosexual orientation, younger age, and symptom severity. Structural equation modeling identified SUD and sexual orientation as the primary determinants of both drug and sexual risk behavior. We conclude that specific illness related variables appear to have less impact on risk behavior among people with SMI than previously hypothesized. Substance abuse prevention and treatment may be the most effective means of reducing HIV risk in this population."
9857,0.005,1.0000,"In order to establish a safe and reliable treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated scabies, we have treated 60 episodes of scabies in this setting, occurring in 39 patients, with one of the following regimens: (i) topical treatment with benzyl benzoate solution; (ii) single-dose oral treatment with ivermectin alone; and (iii) combination therapy with benzyl benzoate solution and oral ivermectin, employing the same regimens as single-agent therapy. Patients were stratified according to the severity score of the disease and the outcome (eradication, relapse, failure). We found that both benzyl benzoate and ivermectin alone were quite effective in mild to moderate scabies, but they were both associated with an unacceptable rate of relapse and failure in severe or crusted scabies. In contrast, combined treatment produced an optimal rate of success, without significant treatment-related side-effects. Therefore, we consider that combination treatment with benzyl benzoate solution and oral ivermectin is preferable to single-agent therapy in crusted scabies occurring in HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients."

5005,0.005,1.0000,"Current data suggest that prophylactic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) vaccines will be most efficacious if they elicit a combination of adaptive humoral and T-cell responses. Here, we explored the use of different vaccine strategies in heterologous prime-boost regimes and evaluated the breadth and nature of immune responses in rhesus monkeys induced by epidermally delivered plasmid DNA or recombinant HIV proteins formulated in the AS02A adjuvant system. These immunogens were administered alone or as either prime or boost in mixed-modality regimes. DNA immunization alone induced cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses, with a strong bias towards Th1-type cytokines, and no detectable antibodies to the vaccine antigens. Whenever adjuvanted protein was used as a vaccine, either alone or in a regime combined with DNA, high-titre antibody responses to all vaccine antigens were detected in addition to strong Th1- and Th2-type CMI responses. As the vaccine antigens included HIV-1 Env, Nef and Tat, as well as simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)mac239 Nef, the animals were subsequently exposed to a heterologous, pathogenic simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)89.6p challenge. Protection against sustained high virus load was observed to some degree in all vaccinated groups. Suppression of virus replication to levels below detection was observed most frequently in the group immunized with protein followed by DNA immunization, and similarly in the group immunized with DNA alone. Interestingly, control of virus replication was associated with increased SIV Nef- and Gag-specific gamma interferon responses observed immediately following challenge."
1608,0.005,1.0000,"The mechanism by which hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes severe inflammatory liver diseases is multifactorial and related to interactions with cell signaling pathways and the ensuing inflammatory response. Activation of JAK/STAT/SOCS signaling is essential for the induction of cellular antiviral responses, contributes to apoptosis and is negatively regulated by SOCS proteins. Recent reports have shown that SOCS3 activation interferes with viral protein expression and treatment response and thereby plays a major role in hepatitis virus infections. We analyzed the expression of SOCS3 in liver specimens from HBV-infected patients using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and determined the effect of HBV on STAT/SOCS signaling in functional cell culture experiments (HuH-7) using HBV-expressing adenoviral constructs (AdHBV). Increased expression of SOCS3 protein was identified in liver specimens from patients with chronic HBV-infection and this correlated with the severity of liver inflammation. In accordance with the IHC-findings, in vitro analyses demonstrated that HBV infection of HuH7 cells was associated with increased expression of SOCS3 protein. In spite of the over expression of its negative regulator SOCS3 we observed a constitutive activation of STAT3. SOCS1 levels were not increased while pSTAT1 was suppressed in HBV-infected HuH7 cells. Our results demonstrate that STAT/SOCS-signaling is dysregulated in HBV-infected hepatocytes both in vivo and in vitro and this correlated with the severity of liver inflammatory changes. This interference of STAT/SOCS signaling by HBV may result in an ineffective immune response against HBV and potentially contributes to viral pathogenesis, malignant transformation and may represent an important mechanism of viral persistence."

To determine if cells in bone marrow are infected with FIV and whether severity of hematopoietic disorder is correlated with the level of viral infection, bone marrow tissues from ten experimentally and two naturally FIV infected cats were examined by in situ hybridization for presence of FIV RNA. Seven of the 12 FIV infected cats were also naturally or experimentally coinfected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV). FIV RNA was detected mainly in megakaryocytes and unidentified mononuclear cells in the bone marrow of cats that were sick and had marrow hypercellularity and immaturity. These included all cats in the acute phase of FIV infection and two of seven long term FIV infected cats. One long term FIV infected cat with lymphosarcoma was also positive for FIV RNA in bone marrow cells. The other four long term FIV infected cats were relatively healthy, with normal bone marrow morphology, and were negative for FIV infected cells. Bone marrow from three non-infected and two cats infected with FeLV alone were also negative for FIV RNA by in situ hybridization. We concluded that megakaryocytes and mononuclear cells were targets of the viral infection and that the presence of FIV RNA in cells of the bone marrow correlated with marrow hypercellularity and immaturity, and severity of illness."

Samples with multiple infections were cloned, and sequence data submitted to phylogenetic analysis. We were able to identify 17 HIV-1 multiple infections out of 47 samples. Multiple infections were mostly composed by a mixture of recombinant viruses (94%), with only one case in which protease gene pure subtypes B and F were recovered. This is the first study that reports the prevalence of multiple infections and intersubtype recombinants in a population undergoing HAART in Brazil. Based on the data there was a steep increase of multiple infections after the introduction of the combined antiretroviral therapy in Brazil. Cases of multiple infections may be associated with HIV-1 genetic diversity through recombination allowing for the generation of viruses showing a combination of resistance mutations. "

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and TB affect similar populations, and there are concerns about both regarding the development of drug resistance associated with poor adherence to therapy. Accordingly, DOT may benefit certain HIV-infected people who have difficulty adhering to highly active antiretroviral therapy. However, important differences exist in the treatment of these diseases that raise questions about how DOT can be adapted to HIV therapy. DOT for management of HIV infection has been effective among prisoners and in pilot programs in Haiti, Rhode Island, and Florida.

1004,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results in gradual immunosuppression due to the loss of CD4+ T cells. In the wake of immune system breakdown, infected individuals may acquire multiple opportunistic infections and develop certain malignancies which ultimately account for the vast majority of deaths in these persons. A limited number of malignancies are directly associated with HIV infection and suggest a common tie between these tumors. Inappropriate immune surveillance resulting in insufficient inhibition of virus replication and inadequate control of the growth of transformed cells may contribute to the development of malignancies in HIV-infected individuals. Alternatively, malignancies in HIV infection may be the consequence of immune dysregulation. Cellular immune responses mediated by antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are of particular importance for immunologic control of viral infections and substantial information has been gathered about theses cells in HIV infection. The goal of this review is therefore to summarize recent findings regarding the cellular immune response to HIV with a particular focus on cytokines released by HIV-specific CTL."
4794,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment strategies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive active injecting drug users (IDUs) must take into account their lifestyles, that often result in low adherence to therapy. The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) offer simpler treatment regimens, but the appearance of drug resistance during treatment failure may cause high levels of cross-resistance to all NNRTIs. We adopted a combination therapy of two NRTIs and nevirapine (NVP) for treatment of IDU patients to evaluate its feasibility in such patients. From October 1998 to December 1999, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 80 IDUs on this regimen were collected. Fisher's exact test, Kaplan Meier method, and Cox model were used for statistical analysis. Overall, 20 IDUs discontinued the treatment because of side effects and 20 IDUs experienced treatment failure. Considering the treatment failure as an end point, 55.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.9%-72.6%) of patients was still undergoing treatment after 12 months compared to 44.6% (31.8%-58.6%) when discontinuation was also taken into account. An increasing trend over time was observed in the CD4+ lymphocyte count, among failing and nonfailing IDUs. By multivariate analysis, baseline HIV-RNA, treatment breaks and low adherence and active injecting drug use turned out to be significantly associated with treatment failure. Our results show that continuing injecting drug use and treatment breaks are the main factors that can lead to treatment failure in IDUs and easily to NNRTI class resistance."

Chun, D. Finzi, J. Margolick, K. Chadwick, D. Schwartz, and R. F. Siliciano, Nat. Med. 1:1284-1290, 1995). Few host factors that directly limit HIV-1 transcription and could support this state of nonproductive HIV-1 infection have been described. YY1, a widely distributed human transcription factor, is known to inhibit HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transcription and virus production. LSF (also known as LBP-1, UBP, and CP-2) has been shown to repress LTR transcription in vitro, but transient expression of LSF has no effect on LTR activity in vivo. We report that both YY1 and LSF participate in the formation of a complex that recognizes the initiation region of the HIV-1 LTR. Further, we have found that these factors cooperate in the repression of LTR expression and viral replication. This cooperative function may account for the divergent effects of LSF previously observed in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the cooperation of two general cellular transcription factors may allow for the selective downregulation of HIV transcription. Through this mechanism of gene regulation, YY1 and LSF could contribute to the establishment and maintenance of a population of cells stably but nonproductively infected with HIV-1."

NRTI-related mitochondrial toxicity has been recognized as a serious adverse effect of HAART. The mechanisms underlying NRTI-induced mitochondriopathy involve the inhibition of the human DNA polymerase gamma mtDNA mutations and oxidative stress. The clinical spectrum of NRTI-related toxicity ranges from a subclinical disease e.g. mild hepatic abnormalities, to a rare life-threatening condition with lactic acidosis and hepatic insufficiency. In the latter, liver histology shows massive steatosis. Ultrastructural assessment of mitochondrial abnormalities may be of help to address the NRTI toxicity in poorly symptomatic patients. Efforts have been recently made to assess the clinical relevance of non-invasive tests including the evaluation of mtDNA or mitochondrial functions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells for the diagnosis of NRTI-associated toxicity."

From May 1996 to June 2000, 9 patients with lactic acidosis (defined as a plasma lactic acid level of >5 mM and plasma pH of <7.38) were identified. Control patients were randomly selected from among a large cohort of patients who initiated a dual NRTI regimen in 1996 or after. Two factors were associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis: first, a creatinine clearance of <70 mL/min before lactic acidosis (OR, 15.8 [range, 3.0-86.5], P<10(-4)), and, second, a low nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count before the inception of NRTI therapy (OR, 8.4 [range, 1.2-infinity], P=.03). The total cumulative exposure to NRTIs was not associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, nor was the cumulative exposure to any of the 4 NRTIs studied. According to these results, monitoring of creatinine clearance, especially in patients with a low nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count, could lead to modifications in antiretroviral therapy in order to diminish the risk of occurrence of lactic acidosis."
6148,0.005,1.0000,"Two hundred eleven male street prostitutes between the ages of 18 and 51 years were interviewed and tested for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Economic, social, and emotional barriers to the reduction of HIV-related risk behavior were examined within the context of several concepts present in the Health Belief Model (HBM). Three lifestyle factors were found to function as barriers to engaging in risk reduction behavior. Subjects who were more economically dependent on prostitution, perceived less control over the hustling encounter, and reported increased pleasure from sexual activity with their customers were more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior. Prostitutes' perception of the severity of HIV infection was not significantly associated with their risk behavior. Unexpected findings indicated that increases in perceived susceptibility to HIV and perceived benefit of condom use for HIV prevention were significantly related to increased risk-taking behavior. Practical applications of findings in the design and implementation of future HIV-related preventive health education programs are discussed."
2381,0.005,1.0000,"We retrospectively investigated the clinical and histopathologic features of hospitalized patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus who had symptomatic lactic acidosis syndrome at a university teaching hospital during 1995-2000. Twelve patients were identified, 11 during 1998-2000; of these, 5 died with rapid progression to otherwise unexplained multiple-organ failure. All had extensive prior exposure to nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). At presentation, the most commonly identified NRTI component of antiretroviral regimens was stavudine plus didanosine. Eleven patients presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and/or emesis. Eight patients had prior acute weight loss (mean [+/-SD], 12+/-5.3 kg). Median venous plasma lactate levels were > or =2-fold greater than the upper limit of normal (2.1 mmol/L). Serum transaminase levels were near normal limits at presentation. Histopathologic studies confirmed hepatic macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis in 6 patients. Concurrent chemical pancreatitis was identified in 6 patients. The increasing number of cases identified during the study period suggests that physicians better recognize symptomatic lactic acidosis and/or that cumulative NRTI exposure may increase the risk for this syndrome."

2611,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis virus coinfections [HBV plus HCV coinfection (HBV/HCV) or HBV plus HDV coinfection (HBV/HDV)] may progress more rapidly to cirrhosis than hepatitis B or C monoinfections in immunocompetent patients. Only limited information is available on the outcome of coinfected patients after liver transplantation. We studied survival rates of 204 patients with viral hepatitis transplanted at our center between 1972 and 1997. HBV/HDV and HBV/HCV coinfections were present in 23 and nine individuals, respectively, while 97 patients had monoinfection by HCV and 75 had HBV monoinfection. Survival of coinfected patients was significantly longer than that of monoinfected patients (14.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 8.5 +/- 0.6 yr; p = 0.0003). The same was true for graft survival (p = 0.0002). In Cox's regression, viral coinfection (p = 0.0001), absence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (p = 0.00001) and no retransplantation (p = 0.02) were independently associated with patient survival. After exclusion of patients with HCC (n = 62), survival of coinfected patients was still significantly longer than that of monoinfected individuals (p = 0.002). The improved outcome was similar for both HBV/HDV and HBV/HCV coinfections. In contrast to immunocompetent patients, individuals with multiple hepatitis virus infections had an improved outcome after liver transplantation. Thus, viral coinfections may be associated with ameliorated courses of diseases under certain conditions."
8563,0.005,1.0000,"Worldwide, more than one million children are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and in the United States it has become the sixth leading cause of death among 15-24-year-olds. Despite the trend of increasing rates of infection, advances in therapies have led to survival past 5 years of age for more than 65% of infected children. This global health threat will therefore continue to have a significant impact on child and adolescent psychiatry and psychology. This paper reviews current studies and reports on the consequences of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic in the psychiatric care and development of children and adolescents infected by HIV. From a search of all the English-language-based literature on pediatric AIDS, 140 studies are reviewed which address HIV infection and its psychological and social implications. Several topics of mental health significance are examined: (1) the epidemiology of HIV, (2) neurocognitive development among those infected, (3) psychological impact of infection, and (4) the family and social context of HIV. The transition of HIV from an acute, lethal disease to a subacute, chronic disease has enormous implications for the neurocognitive and psychosocial development of children and families. As children and adolescents infected with HIV continue to live longer, normal developmental milestones and educational needs will take on new significance. Many children will continue to be adversely impacted by non-HIV factors such as poverty, inadequate medical services, and a lack of social support. This review outlines recent developments that hold promise to effectively reduce the treatment burden on the infected, their families, and health care providers and to decrease the incidence of transmission to the uninfected."

3607,0.005,1.0000,"The reservoir of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a long-lived pool of latently infected cells harboring replication-competent viruses, is the major obstacle to curing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can successfully suppress HIV-1 viremia and significantly delay the progression of the disease, it cannot eliminate the viral reservoir and the patient must continue to take anti-viral medicines for life. Currently, the appearance of the 'Berlin patient', the 'Boston patients', and the 'Mississippi baby' have inspired many therapeutic strategies for HIV-1 aimed at curing efforts. However, the specific eradication of viral latency and the recovery and optimization of the HIV-1-specific immune surveillance are major challenges to achieving such a cure. Here, we summarize recent studies addressing the mechanisms underlying the viral latency and define two categories of viral reservoir: 'shallow' and 'deep'. We also present the current strategies and recent advances in the development of a functional cure for HIV-1, focusing on full/partial replacement of the immune system, 'shock and kill', and 'permanent silencing' approaches.

9036,0.005,1.0000,"The evolution in therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to the more recent use of peginterferons in combination with ribavirin has dramatically increased the sustained virological response (SVR) rates versus standard interferon/ ribavirin combination therapy. However, although peginterferon and ribavirin therapy has markedly improved treatment responses overall, factors such as high viral load, genotype 1 infection, obesity, HIV co-infection and African American race continue to pose challenges to optimizing SVR rates. Application of mathematical models may be helpful in understanding why these groups and/or individuals appear to be resistant to interferon (IFN)-based therapy. This article focuses on the viral kinetics and viral kinetic differences among patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 2, obese and nonobese patients, and African Americans and Whites."
1578,0.005,1.0000,Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) has grown in importance and clinical impact in recent years.

This article reviews treatment options for patients who are coinfected with HIV and HCV.
6979,0.005,1.0000,"Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) have revolutionized the modern treatment of chronic hepatitis C (HCV). These highly efficacious, well-tolerated, all-oral HCV regimens allow cure of HCV in over 95% of HCV-monoinfected as well as HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with short treatment durations of 8-12 weeks. Areas covered: This review will address recent developments of DAA-therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients in clinical trials and real life cohorts and evaluate remaining challenges, particularly resistance, drug-drug interactions, acute HCV infection and liver transplantation focusing on HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Expert opinion: Indeed, all available data have shown that HIV/HCV-coinfection has no impact on HCV-treatment outcome. Management, indication of therapy and follow-up of HCV-infection are now the same for both patient populations. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients however, require careful evaluation of potential drug-drug-interactions between HCV drugs and HIV antiretroviral therapy, medication for substance abuse and other comedications. The few remaining gaps in DAA-therapy in particular treatment of cirrhotic treatment-experienced genotype 3 infections, decompensated cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease and patients with prior DAA treatment failure have mostly been overcome by the development of new HCV agents recently licensed. Clearly, the biggest challenge globally remains the access to treatment and the inclusion of all patient populations affected in particular people who inject drugs (PWID)."

In the present study we report on the case of a patient with a history of drug and alcohol abuse who was sequentially infected with HIV, HCV, HBV and HDV. He died of an overwhelming reactivation of HBV and HDV in spite of a recent interferon treatment. HBV and HDV resumed their active replication after over 20 years of complete latency, that is after long-lasting viral undetectability, when the patient deliberately discontinued his last HAART regimen. HBV and HDV reactivated in spite of a relatively preserved immune system and a recent immune stimulatory treatment with pegylated interferon."
6485,0.005,1.0000,"A therapeutic dilemma arises once HIV-infected patients develop a break-through of HIV-replication under potent antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, we studied whether patients (n = 12) who failed double nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTI) plus indinavir or ritonavir triple therapy can be rescued when therapy is switched to double protease inhibitor (PI) treatment (nelfinavir and hard gel saquinavir) and stavudine. With the rescue regimen HIV-RNA levels initially dropped from 148,571 +/- 45,258 copies/ml to 9,310 +/- 6, 965 copies/ml at week 4 (p = 0.0117). However, virus load subsequently increased to almost baseline levels (131,230 +/- 37,743 copies/ml) at week 12. Likewise, CD4-cell counts could only be stabilized initially (baseline 267 +/- 51; week 4 296 +/- 65 cells/microl), but gradually declined thereafter (216 +/- 34 cells/microl week 12). Before therapy was switched, the viral protease gene from 5 analyzed patients showed 3-5 amino acid substitutions. Moreover, 4 of these patients had one amino acid substitution associated with resistance to nelfinavir. Our data suggest that HIV-infected patients resistant to indinavir or ritonavir and double NRTI combination therapy respond to double PI nelfinavir/saquinavir and D4T rescue therapy only initially but have no sustained benefit."

276,0.005,1.0000,"We measured neopterin, a biochemical indicator for the activation of cell-mediated immune reactions, in urines from 105 individuals at risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), 83 of whom were seropositive for antibody to HIV-1. We compared absolute numbers of T-cell subsets (CD4+ helper/inducer T-cells, CD8+ suppressor/cytotoxic T-cells), and the ratio of CD4+ T-cells to CD8+ T-cells with the urinary neopterin concentrations. Concentrations of neopterin in urine were inversely correlated with absolute numbers of CD4+ T-cells and with CD4+/CD8+ ratios in anti-HIV-1 seropositive subjects but not in those seronegative. Various statistical comparisons of the data further demonstrated that neopterin concentrations showed larger differences between anti-HIV-1 seronegative and seropositive subjects than absolute numbers of CD4+ T-cells or CD4+/CD8+ ratios. These results seem to indicate that neopterin concentrations increase earlier in the course of HIV-1 infection, before effects on T-cell subpopulations are detectable, and may further support the suggestion that neopterin measurement could be of use for monitoring infected subjects or predicting the progression of disease."

The objective of this study was to assess the relative efficacy and toxicity of the dual NRTI part of the regimen in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1-infected adults. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for treatment-naïve HIV-infected adults with a 48-week follow-up were done. We searched the PubMed, CENTRAL, and EMBASE electronic databases up to April 2009. Proceedings from conferences were reviewed. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Primary outcome was viral suppression at 48 weeks. The odds ratio (OR) is reported with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Twenty-two randomized controlled trials, including 8,184 HIV-treatment-naïve patients, were included. The combination didanosine + lamivudine/emtricitabine (four trials, 1,148 patients) was more effective (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.68) for viral load (VL) >50 copies/ml and less toxic (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.36-0.76) for discontinuation due to adverse events (AE) than its comparators. The combination tenofovir + lamivudine/emtricitabine was more effective and less toxic (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96) only in the 144-week follow-up data (two trials, 1,119 patients). Abacavir + lamivudine had similar efficacy to its comparators (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.8-1.1), but more AIDS-defining events (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.24, 8.40). The once-daily combination didanosine + lamivudine/emtricitabine was found to be effective and tolerable. This combination, soon to be generic, should be compared to the current standard of care in a large randomized trial. An effective, safe, and inexpensive alternative to current options is needed."
9253,0.005,1.0000,"Here, we report that the S-acyl-2-mercaptobenzamide thioester (SAMT) class of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nucleocapsid protein (NCp7) inhibitors was able to prevent transmission of HIV-1 from infected cells, including primary cells. Furthermore, when SAMTs were introduced during an HIV-1 challenge of cervical explant tissue, inhibition of dissemination of infectious virus by cells emigrating from the tissue explants was observed. Preliminary studies using a rhesus macaque vaginal challenge model with mixed R5 and X4 simian-human immunodeficiency virus infection found that five of six monkeys were completely protected, with the remaining animal being partially protected, infected only by the R5 virus. These data suggest that SAMTs may be promising new drug candidates for further development in anti-HIV-1 topical microbicide applications."
1526,0.005,1.0000,"The objectives of this study were firstly to estimate total lifetime care costs for an individual with HIV/AIDS, and secondly to estimate the total costs of caring people with HIV infection and AIDS in England and Wales between 1992 and 1997 inclusive. Questionnaires and monthly diaries were used to collate data on healthcare utilisation from patients with HIV infection over a 6-month period. These data were then used to estimate the annual total direct costs of care (stratified by disease stage), total lifetime costs of care, and present and future total national care costs for England and Wales. Costing data were obtained from providers of services throughout Greater London. In total, 235 patients with HIV infection were recruited from 2 clinics in Greater London. All costs were calculated in 1992-93 pounds sterling (pound; 1 pound = $US1.58, December 1995). Annual care costs were estimated at 4515 pounds ($US7134) for a person with asymptomatic HIV disease, 8836 pounds ($US13,961) for a person with symptomatic non-AIDS and 15 268 pounds ($US24,123) for a person with AIDS. Lifetime care costs were estimated at 84,522 pounds ($US133,545) per patient. The total costs of care for England and Wales were forecast to increase from 116,627,400 pounds ($US184,271,300) in 1992 to 162,638,100 pounds ($US256,968,200) in 1997. In conclusion, our study further emphasises the continued shift in hospital services from the inpatient sector to the outpatient sector. The importance of community care and informal care, in terms of the associated direct economic costs, is also highlighted. This emphasises the need for close collaboration between different agencies and strategic coordination of services. Finally, the study forecasts an increase in care costs in England and Wales during the 1990s."
2313,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with some B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B cell-NHLs). Patients with HCV infection frequently show co-infections with GB virus C (GBV-C, formerly known as hepatitis G virus), and some studies have suggested a higher incidence of GBV-C infection in patients with B cell-NHLs. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the association between HCV and/or GBV-C infection and B cell-NHLs in different geographic areas. One hundred thirty-seven lymphoma cases and 125 non-lymphoma matched controls were enrolled in an international case-control study conducted in Switzerland (Bellinzona), Spain (Barcelona) and England (Southampton) on samples collected from 2001 to 2002. In Bellinzona (41 cases and 81 controls), the overall prevalence of HCV was 3.3% (4.9% in NHLs), and the overall prevalence of GBV-C was 24% (22% in NHLs). In Barcelona (46 cases and 44 controls), the prevalence of HCV was 10% (8.7% in NHLs) and the prevalence of GBV-C 20% (13% in NHLs). There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of both infections between patients with NHL and controls. In Southampton, 50 NHL cases were analysed, none of them was found to be HCV-positive; therefore, no control group was analysed and GBV-C analysis was not performed, too. Both in Bellinzona and in Barcelona, the seropositivity rate was significantly lower for HCV than for GBV-C, suggesting that their transmission can be independent. The incidence of HCV was significantly higher in Barcelona than that in Bellinzona. This study confirmed the existence of marked geographic differences in the prevalence of HCV in NHL but cannot provide any significant evidence for an association between HCV and/or GBV-C and B-cell NHLs."
2170,0.005,1.0000,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an acute prothrombotic disorder. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an identified precipitant. This study reviewed 30 episodes of HIV-associated TTP in 24 patients from the South-East England Apheresis units, over the last 10 years. All patients were heterosexual Black Africans. First presentation of TTP revealed a new diagnosis of HIV in eight patients. TTP relapse occurred on six occasions (in four patients) as a result of non-adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Prompt initiation/re-initiation of HAART in parallel with plasma exchange (PEX)±steroid led to prompt remission. Adjunct immunomodulatory agents (e.g. Rituximab) were required in 10% of cases. Once-daily HAART regimens are recommended, being compatible with PEX requirement, maximizing drug exposure between PEX. High viral loads (>500,000 copies/ml) require more PEX to remission. ADAMTS13 activity was reduced (<5%) as detected by collagen-binding assay and anti-ADAMTS13 immunoglobulin G antibodies were raised in 80%. Continued HAART-adherence ensured a durable TTP remission with associated viral control resulting in no evidence of relapse. PEX and HAART are associated with replenishment of ADAMTS13 and viral suppression. More PEX is required in cases with higher viral loads. Continued HAART maintains remission. In a small proportion of cases, further immunomodulatory therapy may be required."
9216,0.005,1.0000,"Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) represent a new generation of antiviral agents for the prevention and treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection. A better understanding of the in vivo efficacy of HIV-1 bNAbs, such as VRC01, in preventing mucosal transmission of HIV-1 has important implications for HIV-1 vaccine design. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of passively transferred VRC01 antibody in preventing HIV-1 vaginal and rectal transmission in humanized bone marrow/liver/thymus mice (hu-BLT mice). Mice were subcutaneously injected with VRC01 IgG, and 24 hours later, they were challenged intravaginally or intrarectally with HIV-1Ada. All hu-BLT mice receiving VRC01 IgG antibody were aviremic at 2 weeks after intravaginal (n = 3) or intrarectal (n = 6) challenge as measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. In contrast, mice receiving control IgG all became infected. By 5 and 6 weeks post-challenge, some of VRC01 aviremic mice in both the intravaginal and intrarectal challenge groups became viremic. Our results suggest that VRC01 antibody can be protective against HIV-1 vaginal and rectal transmission; however, a single administration of VRC01 cannot completely prevent mucosal infection. "
1602,0.005,1.0000,"The potential contribution of a plasmid DNA construct to vaccine-elicited protective immunity was explored in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque model of AIDS. Making use of soluble major histocompatibility class I/peptide tetramers and peptide-specific killing assays to monitor CD8(+) T-lymphocyte responses to a dominant SIV Gag epitope in genetically selected rhesus monkeys, a codon-optimized SIV gag DNA vaccine construct was shown to elicit a high-frequency SIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. This CTL response was demonstrable in both peripheral blood and lymph node lymphocytes. Following an intravenous challenge with the highly pathogenic viral isolate SIVsm E660, these vaccinated monkeys developed a secondary CTL response that arose with more rapid kinetics and reached a higher frequency than did the postchallenge CTL response in control plasmid-vaccinated monkeys. While peak plasma SIV RNA levels were comparable in the experimentally and control-vaccinated monkeys during the period of primary infection, the gag plasmid DNA-vaccinated monkeys demonstrated better containment of viral replication by 50 days following SIV challenge. These findings indicate that a plasmid DNA vaccine can elicit SIV-specific CTL responses in rhesus monkeys, and this vaccine-elicited immunity can facilitate the generation of secondary CTL responses and control of viral replication following a pathogenic SIV challenge. These observations suggest that plasmid DNA may prove a useful component of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vaccine."
2998,0.005,1.0000,"Among the most effective vaccine candidates tested in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque system, live attenuated viruses have been shown to provide the best protection from challenge. To investigate if preimmunization would increase the level of protection afforded by live attenuated SIVmac239Deltanef (Deltanef), macaques were given two priming immunizations of DNA encoding SIV Gag and Pol proteins, with control macaques receiving vector DNA immunizations. In macaques receiving the SIV DNA inoculation, SIV-specific cellular but not humoral responses were readily detectable 2 weeks after the second DNA inoculation. Following boosting with live attenuated virus, control of Deltanef replication was superior in SIV-DNA-primed macaques versus vector-DNA-primed macaques and was correlated with higher levels of CD8+/gamma-interferon-positive and/or interleukin-2-positive cells. Challenge with an intravenous inoculation of simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) strain SHIV89.6p resulted in infection of all animals. However, macaques receiving SIV DNA as the priming immunizations had statistically lower viral loads than control animals and did not develop signs of disease, whereas three of seven macaques receiving vector DNA showed severe CD4+ T-cell decline, with development of AIDS in one of these animals. No correlation of immune responses to protection from disease could be derived from our analyses. These results demonstrate that addition of a DNA prime to a live attenuated virus provided better protection from disease following challenge than live attenuated virus alone."

5946,0.005,1.0000,"Previous research has questioned the effectiveness of existing methods to identify individuals at high risk for contracting and transmitting human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted diseases. Thus, new approaches are needed to provide these individuals with risk-reduction strategies. We review our research on young adults' sexual decision making by using theories and methods from social and cognitive sciences. Four patterns of condom use and associated levels of risks and beliefs were identified. These patterns suggest value in targeting intervention strategies to individuals at different levels of risk. The findings also imply that the monogamous population may be at higher risk for infection than they realize. Primary-care physicians are the first line of contact for many individuals in the health care system and may be in the best position to screen for at-risk individuals. Given the time demands and other barriers, easy-to-use, evidence-based guidelines for such screening are needed. We propose such guidelines for primary-care physicians to use in identifying an individual's risk, from which custom-tailored intervention strategies can be developed."
6525,0.005,1.0000,"During the routine care of patients, pulmonary and critical care specialist may have significant exposure to respiratory infections and potentially infectious body fluids such as blood and pleural fluid. Bronchoscopy and intensive care services often require close contact with patients and the use of sharp devices required for intravascular catheterization. Rendering such care places physicians at risk for acquiring agents such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis viruses, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As of December 1998, 188 cases of occupational transmission of HIV to health care workers (HCWs) in the United States have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control. Most documented cases of seroconversion involve percutaneous injury involving blood, with the greatest risks being associated with injury from a hollow-bore needle that has been in an infected patient's vein or artery. Because thousands of HIV-infected persons are unaware of their infection, HCWs must consider all patients to be infected with HIV and improve work practices accordingly. Nevertheless, elimination of all exposures is impossible, and postexposure prophylaxis with combination antiretroviral therapy is recommended for persons deemed a high risk of contracting HIV. Pulmonary specialists are at high risk of exposure to tuberculosis; proper precautions include isolation of patients with suspected tuberculosis and the use of DMF-HEPA respirator masks, especially while performing procedures like bronchoscopy. Contaminated bronchoscopes have been implicated in transmission and ""pseudoinfection"" of tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria, underscoring the need for rigorous cleaning and disinfection practices."

Five hygienists who came from or worked in high-endemic areas for hepatitis B infection had antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen, consistent with previous infection with hepatitis B virus.

The purpose of the study was to explore knowledge, fears and follow-up care among Asian Americans chronically infected with hepatitis B. A sample of 154 completed an online survey which included demographic information, follow-up treatment information, and HBV knowledge and fears/concerns. Our findings indicate that there are differences by ethnicity and birthplace among Asian Americans in terms of follow-up care and treatment. In addition, our study indicates that there were substantial knowledge gaps regarding contracting HBV, transmission, and prevention. We found that HBV-infected respondents had many fears about their infection. Three primary concerns were identified: (a) concerns related to liver cancer and overall health, (b) transmission to loved ones, and (c) stigma. Our findings indicate that Asian Americans chronically infected with HBV need more education to manage HBV including information on the importance of follow-up treatment and care and education on preventing transmission, risk for liver cancer, and HBV impact on overall health.

We performed a qualitative analysis to understand factors contributing to poor emotional health and its impact among impoverished Peruvian HIV-infected individuals. We conducted focus group discussions with patients and providers consisting of semistructured, open-ended questions. Qualitative analysis provided insight into the profound impact of depression, isolation, stigma, and lack of social support among these patients. Living with HIV contributed significantly to mental health problems experienced by HIV-positive individuals; furthermore, long-standing stressors-such as economic hardship, fragmented family relationships, and substance use-shaped patients' outlooks, and may have contributed not only to current emotional hardship but to risk factors for contracting HIV as well. Once diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, many patients experienced hopelessness, stigma, and socioeconomic marginalization. Patients tended to rely on informal sources of support, including peers and community health workers, and rarely used formal mental health services. In resource-poor settings, the context of mental health problems among HIV-positive individuals must be framed within the larger structural context of poverty and social exclusion. Optimal strategies to address the mental health problems of these individuals should include integrating mental health services into HIV care, task shifting to utilize community health workers where human resources are scarce, and interventions aimed at poverty alleviation."

Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is therefore monitored closely, but follow-up studies of these patients are limited. Virus from 1405 individuals diagnosed with HIV-1 in Denmark between 2001 and 2009 was analyzed for TDR, and molecular-epidemiological links and progression of the infection were described based on data from standardized questionnaires, the prospective Danish HIV Cohort Study, and by phylogenetic analysis. Eighty-five individuals were found to be infected with virus harboring mutations resulting in a prevalence of 6.1%, with no changes over time. The main resistance mutations were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation 215 revertants, as well as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation 103N/S and protease inhibitor (PI) mutations 90M and 85V. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed 12 transmission chains involving 37 TDR individuals. Of these 21 were also documented epidemiologically. The virus included in the transmission chain carried similar resistance mutations to the TDR index case, whereas controls chains from index cases without TDR were generally without resistance mutations. We observed no difference in progression of the infection between individuals infected with TDR and individuals infected with wild-type HIV-1. The prevalence of TDR is low in Denmark and transmission of dual-drug-resistant HIV-1 is infrequent. The TDR isolates were shown to originate from local patients failing therapy."

We describe the application of a simple technique using commercially available kits for detection of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) in dried blood spots (DBS) collected on filter paper. Study participants included subjects with and without chronic HBV infection and subjects with HCC or cirrhosis. Three to five blood drops were dried on filter paper. Dried blood (equivalent to 20 muL) was eluted and tested for HBsAg by Determine(TM) HBsAg and for AFP by counter-current immuno-electrophoresis and radio-immunoassay (RIA). The primary analysis focused on comparison of DBS results to serum testing results as the gold standard. The sensitivity of DBS for detecting chronic HBV infection was 96% (98-98) with specificity of 100% (CI 99-100). Sensitivity of DBS in detecting AFP compared with serum RIA was 73% (60-86) with specificity of 90% (81-98). Both HBsAg and AFP recovery were unaffected when DBS were left at room temperature (30-33 degrees C) and under humid conditions for up to 28 days prior to elution. We conclude that DBS can be reliably used as an economical and logical alternative for detection of HBsAg in chronically infected patients and for AFP-based diagnosis of HCC in clinical situations which preclude adequate collection and processing of blood samples. Both research-oriented field studies and routine clinical care may benefit from application of these techniques in resource-limited settings."

Experience from the developed world indicates that providing effective care and treatment for adolescents poses unique challenges. This study aimed to identify the experiences and needs of adolescents growing up in care or on treatment for HIV in Cape Town, South Africa. Four focus groups interviews were conducted with a total of 26 young people attending an adolescent infectious diseases clinic at a tertiary hospital. Questions explored participant's perceptions on their present and future lives, and their self-identified needs. Focus groups revealed that adolescents viewed their illness negatively, but that social issues such as violence and poverty were also concerns. Despite these stressors, most respondents remained positive about the present and future, and wanted support for achieving their goals. As increasing numbers of HIV-infected children enter adolescence, healthcare providers and communities must find ways to support these young people to transition into adulthood."

9552,0.005,1.0000,"The discovery of hepatitis C was the direct result of the landmark discoveries of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) and their serologies. Screening tests for HAV and HBV made it possible in the mid-1970s to examine cases of transfusion-associated hepatitis (TAH) and to demonstrate that only approximately 25% resulted from HBV and that none were related to HAV. Consequently, approximately 75% of TAH became classified as non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH). Subsequently, chimpanzee studies demonstrated that NANBH was a result of a transmissible agent Although it has been difficult to convince clinicians that NANBH was a serious disease because the overt manifestations are generally mild, it gradually became apparent that the NANBH agent often resulted in chronic hepatitis and sometimes evolved into cirrhosis. The NANBH agent remained a virologic enigma for the next decade until researchers at the Chiron Corporation used an ambitious molecular approach on large volumes of high-titer infectious chimpanzee plasma from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They extracted RNA, cloned it into an expression vector, and screened the expressed product with presumed immune sera. A single positive clone was found in the millions screened, and, within a year, the entire genome was sequenced and the agent was identified as a novel flavivirus--the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Retrospective analysis of pedigreed samples at the National Institute of Health (NIH) showed that 70% to 90% of NANBH cases were HCV related. The impact of HCV blood donor screening has been enormous. The single-antigen first-generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA-1) prevented 40,000 HCV infections within the first year, and the second-generation assay (EIA-2) has actually reduced new transfusion-related HCV infections to almost zero."
7098,0.005,1.0000,"Only some twenty years has passed since the first discovery of severe immunodeficiency among previously healthy homosexual men through the discovery of the causing virus and till the status today where the knowledge on the HIV virus and the pathogenic mechanisms induced by the virus are extensive, though still incomplete. Furthermore, steadily better treatments have been introduced at a paste that is probably without precedents. These processes have been fuelled by various molecular biological methods. The abilities to quantify viremia and to sequence virus and hence describe the evolution of the virus represent valuable tools for understanding the pathogenic processes. The current thesis describes some of the findings obtained. While it was initially thought that the virological profile mimicked the clinical with an acute infection followed for years by clinical latency and only after on average ten years signs of severe immunodeficiency, this understanding has been revised. There is no virological latency. The viral replication is on going throughout the infection. However, the virological profile does resemble the clinical. Viremia is high shortly after infection; hereafter declines, and stabilises around what has been termed the viral set point. This level of viremia is predictive of the clinical course of the infection. We have shown that the viremic levels, measured both as HIV RNA load and proviral DNA load, early in infection carry significant information about the course of the infection. It is; however, not only early viral loads that carry prognostic information, also viral load during late-stage infection is clinically informative. Viral load measurements have evolved as the major tool for monitoring the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy. HIV RNA has been shown to be a good surrogate marker for the clinical efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. How to use the measurements most optimally has however not been fully delineated. Various methods for describing virological response might yield different results, and it is recommended that the pros and cons of the various methods be investigated. In a cohort of patients who had obtained good virological suppression on antiretroviral therapy followed prospectively for two years we found that only few patients experienced high-grade viremia. Furthermore, baseline HIV DNA differed between the patients with various longitudinal HIV RNA profiles. The patients with the most pronounced HIV RNA suppression had lowest proviral load at baseline, with a clear gradient across the groups. The interplay between proviral load and treatment response deserves further investigations. Resistance can develop against all the available antiretrovirals. The high turnover rate of HIV along with the error-prone reverse transcriptase leads to the possibility of steady accumulation of resistance mutations if the viremic suppression is incomplete. While the interplay between viremia and resistance development is clear-cut for some antiretrovirals i.e. Lamivudine, the pattern is more complex for i.e. Zidovudine. With the availability of assays for resistances testing the knowledge on this issue has been ever evolving. How to use resistance testing in the clinical monitoring of patients remains to be clarified. Resistance testing can aid in the process of choosing salvage therapy for patients experiencing virological failure. Whether resistance testing will be of clinical benefit in other situations remains to be determined. Investigation of the viral sequences and evolution herein has not only been used for resistance analyses, but also for tracing the spread of the infection. HIV-1 exists in many subtypes, with various geographic distributions. Hence subtype analyses have been used to investigate the introduction and spread of the HIV infection into many countries. Phylogenetic analyses have also been used to investigate nosocomial transmission events. We used analyses of env and gag sequences to trace a case of nosocomial infection at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Denmark. The study underlines the importance of steady awareness of the infection control precautions and possible breaks herein. The usefulness of this type of analyses was confirmed. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic various replicative patterns were described. Virus obtained from patients with late-stage infection often had virus that could induce syncytium formation (SI) when cultured, while virus obtained from patients in the early stages of infection did not have this ability. A correlation between the SI ability and the ability to yield high virus titres rapidly as well as the ability to establish infection in certain cell lines was found. Patients infected with SI virus experience more rapid clinical deterioration. We found that patients harbouring SI virus have HIV RNA loads no different from patients harbouring NSI virus. This is in line with the findings of other groups. Though patients harbouring SI virus had a more rapid development of resistance when treated with nucleoside reserve transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI's) monotherapy, this was not the case when treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HAART is today considered the treatment modality of choice; both for established HIV-infection and in cases where post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is given in order to prevent establishment of infection after exposure. In a case of transfusion of HIV-contaminated though HIV antibody negative blood the recipient was treated with HAART. As the risk of infection is close to 100% under these circumstances the fact that the recipient remained uninfected is probably attributable to the prompt initiation and thorough maintenance of PEP. PEP is recommended to health care workers after percutaneous HIV exposure as well as after sexual exposure. Even with NRTI monotherapy PEP has been shown to be efficacious. While the explanation for the dichotomy (SI vs. NSI) was for many years unresolved, it is now known that this is due to the requirements of the virus for different co-receptors for cell entry. SI virus uses mainly CXCR4 while NSI virus uses CCR5. Being heterozygous for a 32 basepair deletion in the gene encoding CCR5 leads to slower disease progression. We have shown that heterozygotes have lower HIV RNA levels in the early years of the infection, possibly explaining the clinical advantage of having the deletion. HIV replicates in activated cells, and there is an intriguing interplay between HIV replication and immune activation. HIV-infected patients have elevated levels of immunoglobulins. HIV induces polygonal immunoglobulin production. We found that patients experiencing good virological suppression of HAART had lower IgA levels than patients with less complete viral suppression. Whether IgA can be used as a marker for imminent viral break-through remains to be determined. The full understanding of the interplay between immune activation and HIV replication awaits further studies. The finding of increased viremia in conjunction with acute bacterial or viral infection led to concerns about the safety of vaccinating HIV-infected patients against influenza and pneumococcal infection. We found no difference in HIV RNA levels measured before and median 42 days after anti-pneumococcal vaccination. This is in line with many other studies showing either no or only transient increases in viremia. In conclusion, the knowledge on HIV virology has expanded tremendously. This has led to significant improvements in treatments in the Western World leading to declines in HIV morbidity and mortality. The ability to quantify viral load and to perform sequence analyses represent valuable tools both for understanding the pathogenic actions of the virus and for the clinical monitoring of HIV-infected patients. The optimal usage of these tools in the clinical setting, however, still remains to be defined. The progresses obtained have unfortunately been restricted to the Western World and the calamities of HIV is spreading and worsening in the Developing World. The progress in the development of a vaccine has been disappointing and it is urgently necessary that the progresses obtained within the fields of prevention and treatment are translated into useful strategies in the parts of the world mostly affected by the HIV pandemic."
8705,0.005,1.0000,"A group of conserved hydrophobic residues faces the interior of the coiled-coil-like structure within the N-terminal domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid protein (CA). It has been suggested that these residues are important for maintaining stable structure and functional activity. To investigate this possibility, we constructed two HIV-1 clones, in which Trp23 or Phe40 was changed to Ala. We also constructed a third mutant, D51A, which has a mutation that destroys a salt bridge between Pro1 and Asp51. All three mutants are replication defective but produce virus particles. Mutant virions contain all of the viral proteins, although the amount and stability of CA are decreased and levels of virion-associated integrase are reduced. The mutations do not affect endogenous reverse transcriptase activity; however, the mutants are blocked in their ability to initiate reverse transcription in infected cells and no minus-strand strong-stop DNA is detected. The defect in reverse transcription is associated with striking defects in the morphology of mutant virus cores, as determined by transmission electron microscopy. Our data indicate that the mutations made in this study disrupt CA structure and prevent proper maturation of virus cores. We propose that this results in a defect in core stability or in an early postentry event preceding reverse transcription."

Substitution of the myristoyl-acceptor glycine with alanine, in a functional clone of HIV-1, eliminates virus replication. Complementation of this defect, in trans, restores infectious particle production. The nonmyristoylated (myr-) gag precursor accumulates in infected cells and is not processed into the mature capsid components of the intact virion. However, myr- Pr55gag can be processed by purified HIV protease in vitro, demonstrating that the myristoyl moiety is not required for cleavage by the protease. Myristoylation of Pr55gag is not necessary for localization but is required for stable membrane association and assembly of HIV-1."
4561,0.005,1.0000,"Retroviral tropism is determined in part by cellular restriction factors that block infection by targeting the incoming viral capsid. Indeed, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of many nonhuman primate cells is inhibited by one such factor, termed Lv1. In contrast, a restriction factor in humans, termed Ref1, does not inhibit HIV-1 infection unless nonnatural mutations are introduced into the HIV-1 capsid protein (CA). Here, we examined the infectivity of a panel of mutant HIV-1 strains carrying substitutions in the N-terminal CA domain in cells that exhibit restriction attributable to Lv1 or Ref1. Manipulation of HIV-1 CA could alter HIV-1 tropism, and several mutations were identified that increased or decreased HIV-1 infectivity in a target-cell-specific manner. Many residues that affected HIV-1 tropism were located in the three variable loops that lie on the outer surface of the modeled HIV-1 conical capsid. Some tropism determinants, including the CypA binding site, coincided with residues whose mutation conferred on HIV-1 CA the ability to saturate Ref1 in human cells. Notably, a mutation that reverses the infectivity defect in human cells induced by CypA binding site mutation inhibits recognition by Ref1. Overall, these findings demonstrate that exposed variable loops in CA and a partial CypA ""coat"" can modulate restriction and HIV-1 tropism and suggest a model in which the exposed surface of the incoming retroviral capsid is the target for inhibition by host cell-specific restriction factors."

The hybridization results were compared with the serological and immunohistological data. Integration of HBV DNA in cellular DNA of the liver from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was demonstrated. In two patients from which tumorous and nontumorous liver tissue samples were available the integration patterns were different. In one patient with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive early hepatocellular carcinoma, free viral DNA was present in the liver. In some patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis, without tumor, integration of HBV DNA in cellular DNA was also demonstrated. This suggests that HBV is not the only factor involved in the development of a tumor. In patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis, free viral DNA was detected in the liver. In the two acute hepatitis patients analyzed, the restriction endonuclease patterns strongly suggested HBV DNA integration. Therefore, viral DNA integration seems to occur early in infection. Whatever the form of the disease, discrete bands were observed, suggesting the existence of limited and specific integration sites in host cellular DNA. The presence of integrated or free DNA sequences has implications for antiviral therapy. In addition, detection of HBV DNA in the liver is another sensitive viral marker that could be useful for diagnostic purposes."

Immunoreactive IFN-alpha was detected in sinusoidal cells in 79 patients (88%) and in mononuclear cells in 59 patients (65.6%). Patients with active liver diseases (chronic active hepatitis, active cirrhosis, N = 55) had a higher level of IFN-alpha expression compared to patients with inactive histology (N = 35; sinusoidal cells, P < 0.01; mononuclear cells, P < 0.01). Cytoplasmic HBsAg, nuclear HBcAg, and cytoplasmic HBcAg were detected in 79 (88%), 42 (47%), and 23 (27%) patients respectively. Expression of IFN-alpha in mononuclear cells correlated with the expression of cytoplasmic HBcAg (P < 0.05) but not with nuclear HBcAg or cytoplasmic HBsAg. When the patients were divided into four different phases according to the natural history of chronic HBV infection, patients in the active liver disease phase had higher IFN-alpha expression compared to the immunotolerant and late phase patients (P < 0.01). Using double immunohistochemical staining, both IFN-alpha and cytoplasmic HBcAg were frequently detected near inflammatory infiltrates but no correlation existed between the hepatic expression of HBsAg and IFN-alpha. These data indicate that IFN-alpha is expressed in the liver in HBV-related active liver diseases and that the reported suboptimal production of IFN-alpha by PBMC in HBV-related chronic active liver diseases may be due to a redistribution of the IFN-alpha-producing mononuclear cells into the liver, the site of inflammation."
9965,0.005,1.0000,"HCV and HIV co-infection is associated with accelerated hepatic fibrosis progression and higher rates of liver decompensation and death compared to HCV monoinfection, and liver disease is a leading cause of non-AIDS-related mortality among HIV-infected patients. New insights have revealed multiple mechanisms by which HCV and HIV lead to accelerated disease progression, specifically that HIV infection increases HCV replication, augments HCV-induced hepatic inflammation, increases hepatocyte apoptosis, increases microbial translocation from the gut and leads to an impairment of HCV-specific immune responses. Treatment of HIV with antiretroviral therapy and treatment of HCV have independently been shown to delay the progression of fibrosis and reduce complications from end-stage liver disease among co-infected patients. However, rates of sustained virologic response with PEG-IFN and ribavirin have been significantly inferior among co-infected patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients, and treatment uptake has remained low given the limited efficacy and tolerability of current HCV regimens. With multiple direct-acting antiviral agents in development to treat HCV, a unique opportunity exists to redefine the treatment paradigm for co-infected patients, which incorporates data on fibrosis stage as well as potential drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy.

This study was aimed to identify the prevalence of HBV pre-S deletion/insertion mutations, and to assess the association of pre-S deletion mutation with liver disease progression in Indonesia. Pre-S mutations were identified by direct sequencing. Of the 265 subjects, 32 samples (12.1%) harbored pre-S deletion/insertion mutations. The prevalence of those pre-S mutations was 2.7% (2/75), 12.9% (8/62), 16.7% (11/66), and 17.7% (11/62) in asymptomatic carrier, chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma groups, respectively. Statistical analysis showed significant difference among them (P = 0.024). In HBV genotype B (HBV/B), pre-S1, pre-S1/S2, and pre-S2 deletion mutations were detected respectively in 3 (17.6%), 4 (23.5%), and 9 (52.9%) of 17 samples. On the other hand, in HBV/C, 12 of 15 samples (80.0%) showed a pre-S2 deletion mutation, and only 2 samples (13.3%) demonstrated a pre-S1/S2 deletion mutation. These results suggest that in HBV/B deletion mutation tends to occur in pre-S1 or pre-S1/S2 region, while in HBV/C the deletion mutation usually occurs in the pre-S2 region. Analysis of complete genome of four viruses confirmed that 3 isolates were classified into HBV/B3, and 1 isolate was HBV/C1. However, SimPlot and BootScan analyses showed that isolate 08.10.002 was an intragenotypic recombinant between HBV/B3 and HBV/B4. As conclusion, the prevalence of HBV pre-S mutations was relatively low in Indonesian patients compared to those from Taiwan, Japan, and other Asian countries.

Predominant serotypes were Ib (34.9%) and Ia (25.6%). All were penicillin-susceptible. Two were resistant to erythromycin (4.0%) and one to clindamycin (2.0%). The colonization rate by GBS was high in this cohort. Serotype Ib was the most frequently identified."

The specific aims of the current analysis were to determine (1) the prevalence of HCV infection in a large cohort of patients undergoing retransplantation, (2) define the impact of HCV infection on patient survival, and (3) determine the predictors of outcome of HCV-positive patients undergoing retransplantation for graft failure not caused by primary nonfunction."
4572,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of anemia in HIV-infected persons has not been well characterized in the HAART era. In a single-center, retrospective study, anemia prevalence and risk factors, including use of HAART, were assessed in an ambulatory clinical cohort of 758 HIV-infected patients for the calendar year 2000. The relationships between anemia (hemoglobin level less than 12.5 g/dL) and demographic variables, antiretroviral treatment regimens, and disease markers were analyzed. Mean baseline patient characteristics were hemoglobin level, 13.7 +/- 1.9 g/dL; CD4+ cell count, 405 +/- 293/microL; and HIV RNA level, 77,841 +/- 148,394 copies/mL. Overall anemia prevalence was 30.3%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that anemia was associated with a CD4+ cell count below 50/microL, female sex, black race, a viral load above 100,000 copies/mL, zidovudine use, and older age. Severe anemia was less prevalent in this study population than in historical comparators; however, mild to moderate anemia rates remain high."
763,0.005,1.0000,"Abnormal kidney function is common in the course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Here, we performed a cross-sectional analysis using 399 patients within the Aquitaine cohort (a hospital-based cohort of HIV-1-infected patients receiving routine clinical management) to estimate the prevalence of proximal renal tubular dysfunction (PRTD) associated with HIV infection. These patients did not differ statistically by sociodemographics, median age, years since HIV diagnosis, AIDS stage, or median CD4 cell count from the entire 3080 patient cohort. Antiretroviral therapy was received by 352 patients, with 256 given tenofovir (TDF); 325 had undetectable HIV plasma viral load, and 26 were diagnosed with PRTD. In multivariate analysis, significant independent associations were found between PRTD and age (odds ratio (OR) 1.28 per 5-year increase), atazanavir (OR 1.28 per year of exposure), and TDF (OR 1.23 per year) treatment. Among patients having received TDF-containing regimens over a 5-year period, PRTD remained significantly associated with TDF exposure when treatment was ongoing (OR 5.22) or had been discontinued (OR 11.49). Thus, cumulative exposure to TDF and/or atazanavir was associated with an increased risk of PRTD, with concern about its reversibility in patients with HIV."
325,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with tuberculosis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons living in Switzerland, a country with low prevalence of tuberculous infection. We performed a nested case-control study and logistic regression. Cases (n = 239) were patients participating in the Swiss-HIV Cohort study (n = 7,103), diagnosed with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis. The rest of the cohort population was used as control. Patients from industrialized countries had a risk of tuberculosis similar to those from Switzerland (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.7-1.5); whereas the risk among patients from Eastern Europe (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.9-3.7), Brazil (OR 10.6; 95% CI 9.6-11.5), and Africa (OR 3.0; 95% CI 2.4-3.6) was markedly higher. Immune suppression, as indicated by low CD4 + cell count, was an independent risk factor for tuberculosis (OR 7.8; 95% CI 7.3-8.3 for patients with CD4 + < 50 cells.mm-3 compared to those with CD4 + > 500 cells.mm-3). Age, sex and HIV-transmission category did not appear to increase the risk of tuberculosis after adjustment for other patient characteristics. In conclusion, in countries of low prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, to originate from a country with high prevalence of tuberculosis infection and to have advanced immunodeficiency are significant risk factors for tuberculosis. They may be used to complement the tuberculin skin test in targeting patients for preventive chemotherapy."
8676,0.005,1.0000,"To assess the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive subjects, fecal samples were collected from 120 HIV-seropositive patients and were analyzed for various intestinal parasites. Thirty-six patients (30%) were found to harbor an intestinal parasite. Cryptosporidium parvum was the most common (10.8%), followed by Giardia lamblia (8.3%). Cyclospora cayetanensis and Blastocystis hominis each were detected in 3.3% of the patients, while Isospora belli and Enterocytozoon bieneusi were each detected in 2.5% of the patients. The other parasites observed were Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar in two cases and hookworm ova in one patient. Of the 36 patients who tested positive for intestinal parasites, 27 (75%) had diarrhea. The most common parasite, which was associated with diarrhea, was C. parvum. The present study highlights the importance of testing for intestinal parasites in patients who are HIV-positive, and emphasizes the necessity of increasing awareness among clinicians regarding the occurrence of these parasites in this population."

The study objective was to evaluate the quality of laboratory performance in testing for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibody. After identifying relevant variables in univariate analyses, multivariate analyses were performed using stepwise logistic models. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibody test performance was independently associated with analytic variables such as commercial test kit used and with nonanalytic variables such as experience, training, and degree requirements of laboratory personnel. These results validate the importance of nonanalytic variables to the quality of outcomes in laboratory testing."
9322,0.005,1.0000,"The spectrum of pulmonary manifestations in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is broad, including many infectious and noninfectious complications. In the evaluation of an HIV-infected patient with diffuse pulmonary disease a definitive diagnosis is preferred over empiric therapy in most patients. Patients with focal consolidation usually receive empiric treatment for community-acquired pneumonia, with nonresponders undergoing additional diagnostic testing. Bronchoscopy remains a cornerstone in the diagnostic evaluation. A multilobar bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is usually sufficient for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and avoids the additional complications of hemorrhage and pneumothorax associated with transbronchial biopsy (TBBX). However, TBBX improves the sensitivity for diagnosis of tuberculosis and fungal pneumonias and is necessary to confirm invasive aspergillosis. Definitive criteria for diagnosis of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis have yet to be established, although bronchoscopic specimens usually are used. Tissue confirmation with TBBX is required for the diagnosis of noninfectious disorders such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and lymphocytic and nonspecific pneumonitis. Bronchoscopic visualization of typical lesions often is sufficient for the presumptive diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) although the diagnostic yield is enhanced by the detection of human herpes virus 8 in BAL samples."
4611,0.005,1.0000,"In the United States, transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) from health care exposures has been considered uncommon. However, a review of outbreak information revealed 33 outbreaks in nonhospital health care settings in the past decade: 12 in outpatient clinics, 6 in hemodialysis centers, and 15 in long-term care facilities, resulting in 448 persons acquiring HBV or HCV infection. In each setting, the putative mechanism of infection was patient-to-patient transmission through failure of health care personnel to adhere to fundamental principles of infection control and aseptic technique (for example, reuse of syringes or lancing devices). Difficult to detect and investigate, these recognized outbreaks indicate a wider and growing problem as health care is increasingly provided in outpatient settings in which infection control training and oversight may be inadequate. A comprehensive approach involving better viral hepatitis surveillance and case investigation, health care provider education and training, professional oversight, licensing, and public awareness is needed to ensure that patients are always afforded basic levels of protection against viral hepatitis transmission."
2405,0.005,1.0000,"To identify factors that may affect the quality of laboratory performance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antibody testing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Model Performance Evaluation Program surveyed laboratories in 1989 that performed enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and Western blot tests for HIV-1 antibody. Panels of 10 HIV-1-antibody-positive and antibody-negative plasma samples, some of which were duplicates, were mailed to program-participating laboratories. Laboratories were also mailed survey questionnaires to ascertain their laboratory characteristics and testing practices. Using 1988 data, researchers previously found that the overall analytic performance of laboratories performing HIV-1 antibody testing was independently associated with the following: (1) requiring a minimum degree of testing personnel; (2) having written criteria for identifying unsatisfactory specimens; (3) requiring in-house training for testing personnel; (4) having tested more than 10,000 specimens; (5) being identified as an ""other"" laboratory type; (6) having more than 24 months of testing experience; (7) laboratory uses specific (Abbott) materials for EIA; and (8) testing specimens collected by family-planning clinics. To verify these findings, we performed multivariate analysis on 1989 performance data. For the 1989 EIA analytic sensitivity, significant positive (P < or = .05) associations were detected with having written criteria for identifying unsatisfactory specimens and with having tested more than 10,000 specimens. For the 1989 overall EIA analytic performance, a significant negative (P < or = .05) association was found with using specific (Abbott) EIA materials, and a significant positive (P < or = .05) association was found with having tested more than 10,000 specimens. For Western blot results, the only significant (P < or = .05) associations were for both analytic sensitivity and overall analytic performance and having tested more than 10,000 specimens."

Although studies have shown that individuals with serious mental illness experience less adequate care and worse physical health outcomes than comparable patients without serious mental illness, little is known about HIV care among individuals with serious mental illness who become infected with HIV. In the present study, we describe patterns of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) use and physician monitoring received by 154 patients with serious mental illness infected with HIV. Participants were recruited from mental health agencies in Los Angeles, California. Data from 762 HIV-only patients from a separate Western U.S. probability sample were used for comparison. High proportions of serious mental illness patients with HIV in our sample appeared to be receiving adequate HIV care. Fifty-one percent of all serious mental illness patients with serious mental illness with HIV were taking HAART, and the majority received close monitoring of their CD4 counts (84%) and viral loads (82%) throughout a 1-year period. HAART use and patterns of CD4 count and viral load monitoring did not differ significantly between patients with both serious mental illness and HIV, and patients with HIV only (all p > 0.05). Specialized programs providing assistance to serious mental illness populations with HIV may be helping to narrow health care disparities as a result of having serious mental illness."
5917,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients who undergo organ transplantation is a serious illness, associated with progressive and often fatal liver disease. Attempts at eradication of infection with antiviral agents, such as interferon and adenine arabinoside, have produced disappointing results. Similarly, prevention of HBV reinfection with the use of passive immunization with hepatitis B immunoglobulin or a combination of active and passive immunization have not been uniformly successful. We report the successful use of ganciclovir, a synthetic analogue of 2-deoxyguanosine, in a heart transplant patient with active HBV infection. The patient developed decompensated liver disease with ascites, edema, and marked derangement of liver tests despite drastic reduction in immunosuppressive therapy. Ganciclovir therapy was administered intravenously, and the patient showed remarkable improvement with clinical recovery and normalization of the liver tests. Moreover, the serum HBV DNA and hepatitis B e antigen became undetectable. Ganciclovir was a safe and effective treatment of HBV infection in this transplant patient."
9621,0.005,1.0000,"The continual improvement in outcome with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and visceral transplantation for gut failure stimulated our interest in lifting HIV infection as a contraindication for intestinal and multivisceral transplantation. This report is the first to describe visceral transplantation in a patient with HIV infection. A HAART regimen was introduced in the setting of short-gut syndrome with successful suppression of HIV viral load. The indication for en bloc multivisceral and kidney transplantation was end-stage liver failure with portomesenteric venous thrombosis and chronic renal insufficiency. The underlying hepatic pathology was alcoholic and home parenteral nutrition-associated cirrhosis. Surgery was complicated due to technical difficulties with excessive blood loss and long operative time. The complex posttransplant course included multiple exploratory laparotomies due to serious intra-abdominal and systemic infections. Heavy immunosuppression was required to treat recurrent episodes of severe allograft rejection. Posttransplant oral HAART successfully sustained undetectable viral load. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed to sepsis 3 months posttransplant. With new insights into the biology of gut immunity, mechanisms of allograft tolerance, and HIV-associated immune dysregulation, successful outcome is anticipated, particularly in patients who are in need of isolated intestinal and less-organ-contained visceral allografts.

2794,0.005,1.0000,"An increased incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported among human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients or those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite this association, hitherto only a single case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported in an HIV-infected patient during pregnancy. We describe a young multiparous patient with long-standing AIDS who presented with lower abdominal pain. Following findings of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, low-grade fever, and mental status changes, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was diagnosed after initially considering the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia, and the patient was delivered by cesarean section. The patient required multiple plasma exchanges during a protracted postpartum course, and was discharged in good health. This first report of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and AIDS in pregnancy demonstrates that when encountering preeclampsia in patients with AIDS, thrombotic microangiopathy should be strongly considered. In addition, these patients may exhibit an attenuated response to plasma exchange therapy and despite previous reports in nonobstetric patients, a favorable outcome is attainable in these critically ill patients."
7695,0.005,1.0000,"Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy is an important intervention to prevent the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV and to promote maternal health. Early initiation of ART is particularly important to achieve viral suppression rapidly before delivery. However, current approaches to start ART in pregnancy may be problematic in many settings, with referrals between antenatal care (ANC) and ART services, and delays for patient preparation before ART initiation. These steps contribute to a sizable proportion of women failing to receive adequate duration of ART before delivery, increasing the risk of MTCT. To address these limitations, we developed the rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy (RAP) programme. The programme featured the use of point-of-care CD4 testing to identify ART-eligible women with CD4 cell counts ≤ 350 cells/µl; immediate ART initiation in women on the same day that eligibility was determined, if possible; and intensive counselling and support for ART initiation during the first few weeks on ART. We implemented RAP in an antenatal clinic setting in Cape Town South Africa. Between February and August 2011, a total of 221 HIV-infected women were referred to the programme for CD4 cell count testing and 101 (46%) were eligible for ART. Of these, 98 women (97%) started therapy during pregnancy, 89 (91%) on the day of referral to the service. In-depth interviews suggested that although there were substantial challenges facing HIV-infected women initiating ART in pregnancy, the availability of immediate services and counselling support played an important role in addressing these. While further research is needed, this evaluation demonstrates that a novel service delivery approach may facilitate rapid ART initiation in pregnancy."
1355,0.005,1.0000,"Non-adherence is one of the major causes of treatment failure which leads to increased morbidity and mortality caused by opportunistic infections. Optimal anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence is essential for maximal suppression of viral replication and long term survival of patients. In order to develop effective public health interventions in the context of scaling ART services to peripheral areas, it is important to evaluate factors associated with non-adherence among HIV-infected individuals in Pwani Region. The purpose of this study was to identify factors related to non-adherence to ART among HIV infected people in Pwani Region eastern of Tanzania. A case-control study was carried out at Tumbi Hospital and Chalinze Health Centre in Pwani Region in eastern Tanzania. A structured questionnaire was used to assess non-adherence and adherence to doses instruction and time schedule. Patients with less than 95% adherence were defined as cases while those with more than 95% adherence became controls. A structured questionnaire containing factors known to be associated with non-adherence to ART in similar settings was administered. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with non-adherence. A total of 79 cases and 237 controls matched by age and sex were studied. A high proportion of cases and controls (77.2% and 84.8%) had good knowledge ofART benefits, adherence and eligibility. Majority of cases (73.3%) and controls (69.2%) used public transport to access ART services. More than half of cases (53.2%) missed clinic appointments due to lack of bus fare or other reasons and was associated with ART non adherence (mOR 4.2, 95%CI, 2.2-8.1 and 2.1,95%CI 1.2-4.2). Disclosure to confidants only and failure to disclose HIV-test positive status were associated with non adherence (mOR 3.3, 95%CI 1.3-8.5 and 2.3, 95%CI 1.2-7.1). Alcohol use was associated with non adherence to ART (mOR 1.9, 95%CI 1.4-3.7). Patients who were not satisfied with providers were more likely to be non adherence to ART (mOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.2-3.8). In conclusion, these findings show that adherence is a process which is depended on local specific adherence factors. Adherence improvement strategies need to consider site specific adherence determinants, patient experiences and concerns."

Its prevalence varies widely across different populations and geographic regions. A population-based study in the city of Salvador, located in the Northeast region of Brazil, showed an overall prevalence of HTLV-1 seropositivity of 1.7%. Blood borne virus infections are recognized as important hazards for patients and staff in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) units but most studies focus on hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency viruses.

3436,0.005,1.0000,"The drug resistance profile of treatment-naive HIV-infected individuals living in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was studied. Samples taken from 94 drug-naive individuals with established HIV infection and 13 patients with primary HIV infection were assessed by nucleotide sequencing and LIPA. The prevalence of drug-associated primary mutations in individuals with established infection was very low. In the viral protease region, 1/86 (1.2%) individuals carried the D30N mutation, whereas 1/85 (1.2%) had the M41L mutation in the reverse transcriptase (RT) region. Secondary mutations in both the protease and RT regions were found in almost 90% of the individuals. In individuals with primary infection, primary mutations were detected in 2/13 (15.4%) patients, one of them carrying M461 mutation in the protease while the other patient had a mutation at codon 184 of the RT. In accordance with current drug resistance testing guidelines, the results of this study suggest that susceptibility tests need not be performed at this time prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected people in Argentina. However, the public health implications of this subject warrant follow-up studies that will examine a larger number of drug-naive patients, not only in Buenos Aires but also in other major Argentinian cities and in rural areas."

The purpose is to describe the clinical and histological findings in an HIV-infected patient, who after being treated successfully for tuberculous lymphangitis 4 years ago, presented with a lingual ulcer as the only suggestive sign of recurrence of mycobacterial infection, probably M. tuberculosis. A 39-year-old man seen in the HIV clinic of the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición ""Salvador Zubirán"" in Mexico City since 1991 for HIV infection. In 1999 the patient developed tuberculous lymphangitis; he was managed with a 4-drug regimen for 12 months, with improvement of local and systemic symptoms. In May of 2003, the patient presented a painful superficial lingual ulcer, 0.7 cm in diameter, well circumscribed, crateriform with slightly elevated, irregular and indurated borders, of 4 months duration. The histopathological examination showed chronic granulomatous inflammation with giant multinucleated cells, suggestive of mycobacterial infection, and recurrence of TB was considered. Rifampin, isoniazide, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin were administered. The lingual lesion improved with partial healing at the first week and total remission at 45 days after the beginning of the antituberculous treatment. In June, 2003, the patient began highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) that included two NRTIs and one NNRTI. At 7 months of follow-up, the patient remains free of lingual lesions. The particularity of the present case is that the lingual ulcer was the only sign of infection by mycobacteria, suggestive of TB, in an HIV/AIDS patient that probably represented a recurrence of a previous episode."
3010,0.005,1.0000,"Patients coinfected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were studied with regard to nucleotide sequence variability in the E2/NS1 first hypervariable region of the HCV genome. The nucleotide variability within individual patients was compared to patients infected only with HCV. The proportion of predicted synonymous and nonsynonymous amino acid changes, and the relationship to putative high-antigenicity sites, were evaluated in the hypervariable envelope domain. Ninety-one clones from 10 patients with HCV/HIV coinfection were sequenced, following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the hypervariable region. The control HCV group included 53 clones from 7 patients. Sequence analysis encompassed the region coding for amino acids 384 to 414. Consensus sequences from each patient were used as the internal standard for nonsynonymous amino acid codon variability. Cumulative proportional comparison at each amino acid site revealed increased variability in HCV RNA from patients with HCV/HIV coinfection versus HCV alone (P < .05). The greatest variability was observed at amino acids 386, 397, 400, 402, 405, 407, and 414, with >l0 percent clonal variation at these sites. Jameson-Wolf plots were used to predict putative high-antigenicity domains. Nonsynonymous clonal variation resulted in alteration of putative antigenic sites within the hypervariable region. All clones had at least one high-probability site. Clones with unique predicted antigenic domains were observed more frequently in HIV/HCV coinfected patients, and, independent of viral titer, were consistent with increased sequence variability. These data suggest an accumulation of envelope variants in the HCV/HIV coinfected patients, which could be related to ineffective viral clearance, and may help explain prior reports of interferon (IFN) resistance in this patient group."
5506,0.005,1.0000,"Genetic variation during the course of infection of an individual is a remarkable feature of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease. This variation has been studied for the envelope protein encoding regions of seventeen different sequences from various isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using multiple sequence comparison and calculation of variability. The open regions with little intramolecular base pairing in these envelope sequences are predicted by a recently developed statistical method. The minimum length L for a run of hypervariable sites, conserved sites, or open regions that gives significance at the 1% (or 0.1%) level is then determined by a scan statistical method. The results show that significant clusters of open regions predicted at the RNA levels correlate with significant clusters of hypervariable sites in the HIV envelope gene. Those significant genomic variations in HIVs seem to be manifested mainly in the extracellular portion of the envelope protein. Twelve potential antigenic determinants are predicted using an antigenic index method. Interestingly, the majority of the significant hypervariable regions in the exterior envelope protein (gp120) were predicted potential epitopes."

Nevertheless, when antiretroviral therapy fails to be fully suppressive, new viral variants emerge, thus allowing HIV-1 to escape from drug pressure by accumulating mutations. Between 50% and 70% of treated patients with virological rebound harbour some form of drug-resistant virus; transmitted drug resistance in drug-naïve populations has reached 5-20% in areas of the world with access to treatment. The emergence of drug-resistant viruses remains the limiting factor in HIV-1 management, being a major cause of treatment failure, and being associated with clinical progression and death. All international guidelines focus on the importance of tailoring antiretroviral therapy to the individual patient, on the basis onf HIV-1 genetic data, integrated with clinical, laboratory and therapeutic information.

Recent national case surveillance data for youth (defined here as adolescents and young adults 13 to 24 years of age) revealed that the burden of HIV/AIDS fell most heavily and disproportionately on African American youth, particularly males having sex with males. To effectively increase linkage to care and sustain adherence to therapy, interventions should address the immediate drivers of ARV compliance and also address factors that provide broader social and structural support for HIV-infected adolescents and young adults. Interventions should address psychosocial development, including lack of future orientation, inadequate educational attainment and limited health literacy, failure to focus on the long-term consequences of near-term risk behaviors, and coping ability. Associated challenges are closely linked to the structural environment. Individual case management is essential to linkage to and retention in care, ARV adherence, and management of associated comorbidities. Integrating these skills into pediatric and adolescent HIV practice in a medical home setting is critical, given the alarming increase in new HIV infections in youth in the United States. "

Plasma viral load (PVL) testing has become a cornerstone of HIV disease management. Initiation of antiretroviral drug therapy is usually recommended when the PVL is 10,000 to 30,000 copies per mL or when CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts are less than 350 to 500 per mm3 (0.35 to 0.50 x 10(9) per L). PVL levels usually show a 1- to 2-log reduction within four to six weeks after therapy is started. The goal is no detectable virus in 16 to 24 weeks. Periodic monitoring of PVL is important to promptly identify treatment failure. When feasible, the same assay should be used for serial PVL testing in the individual patient. At least two PVL measurements usually should be performed before antiretroviral drug therapy is initiated or changed. PVL testing may be helpful in the rare instance of indeterminate HIV antibody testing, especially in a patient with recent infection."

None of the cirrhotic patients and patients with chronic renal failure, in the present study, were infected with type 1 of HCV. While PCR-RFLP, typing was rapid in conjunction with the primers used for RT-PCR, NS5 typing was helpful in determining the subtype. There was good correlation between the two typing methods and this method can be used as a cost-effective method for studying large number of samples. The study shows that predominant genotypes of HCV in South India include type 1 and 3. Type 3 seems to be transmitted nosocomially as suggested by the results in patients with chronic renal failure, as these patients are exposed to multiple medical interventions."

A prospective study on active targeted HTC and linkage to care among MSM (≥18 years old) was conducted at a gay sauna in Thailand from November 2013 to October 2015. HIV risks and risk perception were evaluated through an anonymous survey. HIV testing with result notification and care appointment arrangement were provided on-site. Of the 358 participants; median age was 30 years; 206/358(58%) were at high risk for HIV acquisition; 148/358(41%) accepted HTC, all of whom either had prior negative HIV tests [98/148 (66%)] or had not known their HIV status [50/148 (34%)]. The three most common reasons for declining HTC were prior HIV testing within 6 months (48%), not ready (19%) and perceiving self as no risk (11%). Of the 262 moderate- and high-risk participants, 172 (66%) had false perception of low HIV risk which was significantly associated with declining HTC. Among the 148 participants undergoing HTC, 25 (17%) were HIV-infected. Having false perception of low risk (P = 0.004) and age <30 years (P = 0.02) were independently associated with HIV positivity. Only 14 of the 25 HIV-infected participants (56%) could be contacted after the result notification, of whom 12 (86%) had established HIV care and received immediate antiretroviral therapy. The active targeted HTC and facilitating care establishment was feasible among MSM attending the gay sauna but required strategies to improve accuracy of HIV-risk perception and linkage to care."
6034,0.005,1.0000,"Major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are part of the cellular immune response to persistent virus infections. Candidate vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) should elicit broad cross-reactive immunity to confer protection against different strains of HIV-1. As it is likely that candidate vaccines will include the envelope gene product Env, we determined the proportion of CTL clones which recognized variable and conserved determinants in three env variants during natural infection. Limiting dilution analysis was used to characterize numerous short-term CTL clones derived from peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected subjects, using split-well analysis to assay cytotoxicity against target cells expressing gp160env of HIV-1 strains IIIB, MN, and RF. In 9 of 12 HIV-1-infected subjects, at the clonal level most env-specific CTL recognized determinant(s) within one env variant but not in the other variants. In some subjects, CTL recognized multiple nonconserved determinants in different variants. The pattern of recognition of different env variants was relatively stable over time. In most of the patients studied, the proportion of CTL which showed cross-recognition of conserved determinants shared among the three strains was low. Two novel CTL epitopes within gp41 were identified by using 15-mer peptides of the HIV-SF2 sequence. When specific peptide was used to stimulate CTL precursors in vitro, the frequency of peptide-specific CTL precursors was very high, but the CTL elicited by this stimulation were highly strain specific. We conclude that the use of a single HIV env variant to detect CTL activity can underestimate the magnitude and complexity of the env-specific CTL response. The low prevalence of CTL clones which show cross-recognition of conserved determinants may have implications for immunization strategies based solely on env; to elicit broadly cross-reactive CTL other, more conserved viral antigens are likely to be needed in addition to env. Because of its capacity to distinguish CTL responses against different virus strains, limiting dilution analysis is particularly appropriate to quantitate the immune responses generated by candidate env-based vaccines."

This study analyzed longitudinal sera collected over a 9-year period from a patient infected with this variant to investigate the clinical profile and intrahost viral evolution over time. The patient, who had immigrated to Canada in 1998 from Vietnam, was treated with lamivudine in 2000. Approximately 4-5 years following the withdrawal of lamivudine therapy, a genomic ""shift"" occurred coincident with ALT flares and increasing HBV viral load, resulting in numerous stable nucleotide substitutions within the core coding region, suggesting altered immune control that may provide a selective advantage to the virus. Analysis of quasispecies diversity over time demonstrated further this shift, with two sequence clusters associated with time points either prior to or following relapse observed, including increased diversity among quasispecies prior to relapse. In keeping with the complex nature of genotype I strains, majority population genomes had a mean genetic distance from genotype C of 7.6 +/- 0.1%, although large genomic segments lacked significant homology with any HBV genotype. Further study is needed to understand the evolutionary origin and natural history of infection with this unique HBV variant."

Lymphoma cells are always infected with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) and in most cases coinfected with Epstein-Barr virus. In classic presentation, PEL is characterized by body cavity effusions with or without mass lesions. A variant with only extracavitary localization has also been described. We report on a large single-center series of patients with PEL in the era of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). The main objective was to compare the characteristics and the outcome of patients with classic (n = 34) and extracavitary (n = 17) variant PEL. At PEL diagnosis, no major difference was observed between the two groups in terms of demographic and HIV characteristics. Extracavitary localizations were exclusively nodal in six patients and involved various organs in 11 patients. Another HHV-8-associated disease was observed in 31 patients, Kaposi sarcoma in 25, and multicentric Castleman disease in 18 patients, without difference between the two groups. Thirty-two patients were treated with CHOP associated with high-dose methotrexate, 13 were treated with CHOP-derived regimen alone, and six patients received low-dose/no chemotherapy. Complete remission was achieved in 21 (62%) and seven (41%) patients of the classic and extracavitary groups, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) was 10.2 months. Despite a higher disease-free survival in the extracavitary group, there was no difference in OS between the two variants. Based on this series, characteristics of classic and extracavitary variants were very close. Although prognosis of PEL remains very severe in cART era, the median survival compares favorably with earlier series."

Pretreatment HBV DNA levels and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels correlated inversely with the time to HBV DNA breakthrough with YMDD variants (r = -0.46, P =.001; r = -0.45, P =.001 respectively). Patients harboring YMDD variants 3 months before HBV DNA breakthroughs had higher HBV DNA breakthrough levels compared with those without YMDD variants 3 months before HBV DNA breakthroughs (18.9 x 10(6) vs. 5.4 x 10(6) copies/mL, P =.007). Patients with HBV DNA breakthroughs had higher percentages of YMDD variants without the presence of wild-type YMDD compared with patients without HBV DNA breakthrough (25.6% vs. 9%, P =.007 for single M552I variant; 20.9% vs. 8.1%, P =.026 for single M552V variant; 30.2% vs. 9.9%, P =.004 for M552I/M552V variants). Patients with HBV DNA levels of more than 10(3) copies/mL after 6 months of lamivudine therapy had a 63.2% chance of subsequently developing YMDD variants. HBeAg seroconversion occurred in 2 patients after the emergence of YMDD variants. Only one patient developed YMDD variant after HBeAg seroconversion.

6820,0.005,1.0000,"Perceived social standing (PSS) was evaluated as a determinant of differences in health outcomes among Ugandan HIV-infected adults from Kampala using cross-sectional study design. PSS was defined using the MacArthur scale of subjective social status translated and adapted for the study setting. Socio-demographic and psychosocial correlates of PSS ranking at enrollment were determined using linear regression models. High versus low PSS was defined based on the median PSS score and evaluated as a determinant of body mass index, hemoglobin, quality of life (QOL) and frailty-related phenotype via linear regression. A log-binomial regression model estimated the relative-risk of good, very good or excellent versus fair or poor self-rated health (SRH) in relation to PSS. Older age, increasing social support and material wealth were correlated with high PSS ranking, whereas female sex, experience of multiple stigmas and multiple depressive symptoms were correlated with low PSS ranking. High PSS participants were on average 1.1 kg/m(2) heavier, had 4.7 % lower frailty scores and 3.6 % higher QOL scores compared to low PSS patients (all p < 0.05); they were also more likely to self-classify as high SRH (RR 1.4, 95 % confidence interval 1.1, 1.7) but had comparable hemoglobin levels (p = 0.634). Low PSS correlated with poor physical and psychosocial wellbeing in HIV-positive Ugandan adults. The assessment of PSS as part of clinical management, combined with efforts to reduce stigma and improve social support, may identify and possibly reduce PSS-associated health inequality in Ugandan adults with HIV."

Although several in vitro activities have been attributed to the Nef protein, identifying the one critical for in vivo pathogenicity remains elusive. In this study, we examined a large number of nef alleles derived at various time points from 13 perinatally infected children showing different progression rates: six nonprogressors (NPs), three slow progressors (SPs), and four rapid progressors (RPs). The patient-derived nef alleles were analyzed for their steady-state expression of a Nef protein, for their relative ability to downregulate cell surface expression of CD4 and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and for their capacity to bind the clathrin adaptor AP-1 complex. We found that NP-derived nef alleles, compared to nef alleles isolated from SPs and RPs, had reduced CD4 and MHC-I downregulation activities. In contrast, SP- and RP-derived nef alleles did not differ and efficiently downregulated both CD4 and MHC-I. AP-1 binding was a conserved function of primary nef alleles not correlated with clinical progression. Defective Nef proteins from NPs, rather than sharing common specific changes in their sequences, accumulated various amino acid substitutions, mainly located outside the conserved domains previously associated with Nef biological properties. Our data indicate that Nef-mediated downregulation of cell surface CD4 and MHC-I significantly contributes to the expression of the pathogenic potential of HIV-1."

This was a prospective cohort study of 550 individuals in the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort initiating ART between 2000 and 2012. The relationship between alcohol consumption (defined using NIAAA categories of non-, moderate, and hazardous drinkers) and liver fibrosis (FIB-4 score) by ART class was assessed using linear mixed effects models. Additionally, we examined whether the presence of HCV modified and whether viral load mediated the relationship between alcohol use and liver fibrosis. Overall, FIB-4 levels were 15.6% higher in hazardous drinkers compared to moderate drinkers (p = 0.025) after adjusting by age, sex, and race. Hazardous drinkers on PI-based regimens had FIB-4 scores 26.9% higher than moderate drinkers (p = 0.015). However, there was no difference in FIB-4 levels between hazardous drinkers on non-PI-based regimens compared to moderate drinkers (1.83% versus moderate drinkers, p = 0.848). There was no significant difference in FIB-4 between nondrinkers and moderate drinkers, irrespective of ART regimen. These associations were not modified by HCV status or mediated by viral load changes. Individuals with hazardous alcohol consumption and on PI-based regimens had significantly increased liver fibrosis, as measured by the FIB-4. These data suggest that providers should consider level of alcohol consumption when choosing an ART regimen to minimize detrimental effects on the liver."

In this country, serological screening of hepatitis viruses B and C is only systematic among blood donors. The aims of this study were; (1) to investigate the reasons for the prescription of the screening for hepatitis B and C; (2) to determine HCV and HBV prevalence among 462 patients attending the Saint Camille Centre and (3) to identify patients with acute hepatitis or with chronic hepatitis for better monitoring. From February to May 2012, 462 patients attending the laboratory of the Saint Camille Medical Centre with viral hepatitis suspicion were screened. The hepatitis B and C serological markers were detected through Enzyme Immuno Assay (EIA) technique using commercial reagent kits. The clinical symptoms were also recorded for each patient. The results revealed that, the main clinical symptoms that prompted physicians to request HBV and HCV screenings were: asthenia (39.4%), anorexia (21.2%), abdominal pains (19.0%), nausea (10.4%), others (10.0%). The prevalence of HbsAg was 29.4% among the screened people. Patients with acute hepatitis B, active chronic hepatitis B and non-active chronic hepatitis B represented 11.2, 2.2 and 16.0%, respectively. The acquisition of immunity against HBV after vaccination was attempted for 11.7% people. HCV prevalence was 3.9% and its coinfection with HBV was 2.2%. This study showed a high prevalence for hepatitis B and C among patients attending Saint Camille Medical Centre.

5289,0.005,1.0000,"More than 500,000 people die each year from the liver diseases that result from chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Therapeutic vaccines, which aim to elicit an immune response capable of controlling the virus, offer a potential new treatment strategy for chronic hepatitis B. Recently, an evolved, high-titer vaccine platform consisting of Semliki Forest virus RNA replicons that express the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) has been described. This platform generates virus-like vesicles (VLVs) that contain VSV G but no other viral structural proteins. We report here that the evolved VLV vector engineered to additionally express the HBV middle surface envelope glycoprotein (MHBs) induces functional CD8 T cell responses in mice. These responses were greater in magnitude and broader in specificity than those obtained with other immunization strategies, including recombinant protein and DNA. Additionally, a single immunization with VLV-MHBs protected mice from HBV hydrodynamic challenge, and this protection correlated with the elicitation of a CD8 T cell recall response. In contrast to MHBs, a VLV expressing HBV core protein (HBcAg) neither induced a CD8 T cell response in mice nor protected against challenge. Finally, combining DNA and VLV-MHBs immunization led to induction of HBV-specific CD8 T cell responses in a transgenic mouse model of chronic HBV infection. The ability of VLV-MHBs to induce a multispecific T cell response capable of controlling HBV replication, and to generate immune responses in a tolerogenic model of chronic infection, indicates that VLV vaccine platforms may offer a unique strategy for HBV therapeutic vaccination."

This study aims to investigate the implication of genetic polymorphisms of TLR4 gene on the HCV infection in Saudi Arabian patients. Two SNPs in the TLR4 gene, rs4986790 (A/G) and rs4986791 (C/T), were genotyped in 450 HCV patients and 600 uninfected controls. The association analysis confirmed that both SNPs showed a significant difference in their distribution between HCV-infected patients and uninfected control subjects (P < 0.0001; OR = 0.404, 95% CI = 0.281-0.581) and (P < 0.0001; OR = 0.298, 95% CI = 0.201-0.443), respectively. More importantly, haplotype analysis revealed that four haplotypes, AC, GT, GC, and AT (rs4986790, rs4986791), were significantly associated with HCV infection when compared with control subjects. One haplotype AC was more prominently found when chronic HCV-infected patients were compared with cirrhosis/HCC patients (frequency = 94.7% and P = 0.04). Both TLR4 SNPs under investigation were found to be significantly implicated with HCV-infection among Saudi Arabian population."

The efficacy of leukocyte filtration was evaluated by counting, CD45 quantitative PCR, and HIV-1 DNA quantification. Plasma HIV-1 was tested by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. A specific, miniaturized filter was developed and tested for leukocyte and plasma virus retention, WB sample dilution, and filtration parameters in HIV-1-spiked WB samples. This device proved effective to retain >99.9% of white blood cells in 100 μl of WB without affecting plasma VL. The Samba sample preparation chemistry was adapted to use a leukodepleted WB sample for VL monitoring using the point-of-care Samba-1 semiautomated system. The clinical performance of the assay was evaluated by testing 207 consecutive venous EDTA WB samples from HIV-1-infected patients attending a CD4 testing clinic. Most patients were on antiretroviral treatment (ART), but their VL status was unknown. Compared to the Roche Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 test, the new Samba assay had a concordance of 96.5%. The use of the Samba system with a VL test for WB might contribute to HIV-1 ART management and reduce loss-to-follow-up rates in resource-limited settings. "
7278,0.005,1.0000,"Recently increased availability of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has mitigated HIV-1/AIDS prognoses especially in resource poor settings. The emergence of ART resistance-associated mutations from non-suppressive ART has been implicated as a major cause of ART failure. Reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI)-resistance mutations among 12 non-subtype B HIV-1-infected children with treatment failure were evaluated by genotypically analyzing HIV-1 strains isolated from plasma obtained between 2001 and 2004. A region of pol-RT gene was amplified and at least five clones per sample were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed HIV-1 subtype A1 (n = 7), subtype C (n = 1), subtype D (n = 3), and CRF02_AG (n = 1). Before treatment, 4 of 12 (33.3%) children had primary RTI-resistance mutations, K103N (n = 3, ages 5-7 years) and Y181C (n = 1, age 1 year). In one child, K103N was found as a minor population (1/5 clones) before treatment and became major (7/7 clones) 8 months after RTI treatment. In 7 of 12 children, M184V appeared with one thymidine-analogue-associated mutation (TAM) as the first mutation, while the remaining 5 children had only TAMs appearing either individually (n = 2), or as TAMs 1 (M41L, L210W, and T215Y) and 2 (D67N, K70R, and K219Q/E/R) appearing together (n = 3). These results suggest that ""vertically transmitted"" primary RTI-resistance mutations, K103N and Y181C, can persist over the years even in the absence of drug pressure and impact RTI treatment negatively, and that appearing patterns of RTI-resistance mutations among non-subtype B HIV-1-infected children could possibly be different from those reported in subtype B-infected children."

In this study, virus sequence diversity in three unrelated, clade A infected women preceding and shortly after seroconversion was evaluated. It was demonstrated that there is measurable evolution of envelope gene sequences over this time interval. Furthermore, in each of the three individuals, amino acid substitutions arose at five or six positions in sequences derived at or shortly after seroconversion relative to sequences obtained from the seronegative sample.

Antibodies to HTLV-1 were found in 32/704 (4.5%) of the patients. Each co-infected individual was matched with two HIV mono-infected patients according to World Health Organization clinical stage, age +/-5 years and gender. Key clinical and laboratory characteristics were compared between the two groups. Mono-infected and co-infected patients displayed similar clinical characteristics. However, co-infected patients had higher absolute CD4+ T-cell counts (P = 0.001), higher percentage CD4+ T-cell counts (P < 0.001) and higher CD4/CD8 ratios (P < 0.001). Although HIV plasma RNA viral loads were inversely correlated with CD4+ T-cell-counts in mono-infected patients (P < 0.0001), a correlation was not found in co-infected individuals (P = 0.11). Patients with untreated HIV and HTLV-1 co-infection show a dissociation between immunological and HIV virological markers. Current recommendations for initiating ART and chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections in resource-poor settings rely on more readily available CD4+ T-cell counts without viral load parameters. These guidelines are not appropriate for co-infected individuals in whom high CD4+ T-cell counts persist despite high HIV viral load states. Thus, for co-infected patients, even in resource-poor settings, HIV viral loads are likely to contribute information crucial for the appropriate timing of ART introduction."
7666,0.005,1.0000,"National programmes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination are recommended by the World Health Organization for all countries. Countries suffering the highest burden of HBV disease are those most needy of universal vaccination, but are frequently of very low income and resources for health care are scarce. The introduction of HBV vaccination would inevitably stretch these resources further even with support of donor agencies. Thus an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of HBV vaccination is desirable to assist in decision making about resource allocation. We describe here a method for estimating the additional costs of introducing HBV vaccination into the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) at a national level. Of fundamental importance is that this method enables costs to be assessed prior to the introduction of vaccination. We illustrate the method using a study carried out at the sub-national level, in the city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, but which can be expanded countrywide. The method, in brief, involved the use of a number of questionnaires which could be used to estimate the costs associated with the EPI programme from a large sample of the static clinics as well as from central sources. Since unit costs were collected along with the quantities of resources used and estimates of the capacity used for certain facilities (such as refrigerators), the additional cost of introducing HBV vaccine could be estimated largely by extrapolation of the resources used in vaccinating against diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus vaccine (which, similar to HBV vaccine, requires three doses). The estimation of costs is only part of the information required to make decisions on resource allocation, and should be used in association with measures of the burden of disease due to the infection in the community and effectiveness of the control programme at reducing this burden. The prediction of the latter, based upon a sound epidemiological understanding of the infection, is the subject of a forthcoming paper."

Four hundred eighty-nine young adults ages 18-24 years were recruited from Bushwick, Brooklyn through multistage household probability sampling (n = 332) and targeted sampling (n = 157), interviewed, and tested for three hepatitis B markers (HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs). Serological evidence of HBV infection was found in 8.0% (6.0% in the household sample and 12.1% in the targeted sample) and of hepatitis B immunization in 19.6% (22.6% in the household sample and 13.4% in the targeted sample). HBV infection was higher among young adults who either used crack or injected drugs and among those who traded sex for money or drugs. Having Medicaid was significantly associated with lower odds of infection in the household sample and higher odds of immunization in the targeted sample. Although adolescent hepatitis B immunization has been a public health priority in the United States since 1995, nearly three-quarters of young adults in this community did not have serological evidence of being either exposed or immunized. Whereas subsequent younger generations benefited from universal childhood hepatitis B immunization, this particular cohort of young adults who live in communities like Bushwick presents a unique group for prevention intervention."

However, such assays only provide HIV-1 replication rates at the moment samples are drawn and do not reflect any trend in viremia fluctuation preceding sample collection. The objective of this study was to correlate the optical density (OD) of the less sensitive HIV-1 enzyme immunoassay (EIA), used in the serologic testing algorithm for recent HIV seroconversion, with viral loads in a group of HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. We studied samples from 20 previously antiretroviral-naive subjects treated with the zidovudine-lamivudine combination plus indinavir for a 20-week period. Viral loads were assessed using the less sensitive HIV-1 EIA at baseline and at 4-week intervals. There was a strong correlation between lower OD and viral load after introduction of antiretroviral drugs (p < 0.01). The ODs tended to decrease in parallel with drops in viral loads and remain steady when viral loads did not change significantly. These results suggest that the less sensitive HIV-1 EIA may be used as a complementary method for monitoring the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy, with special appeal in resource-poor areas where health professionals have limited laboratory expertise."

Between June 2000 and September 2002, 1,480 participants (1,183 HIV-infected persons and 297 controls) were enrolled in FRAM. Measurements taken included whole-body magnetic resonance imaging for quantification of regional fat, anthropometric measurements, central laboratory analysis of metabolites, and assessment of symptoms, sociodemographic factors, and lifestyle. Similar measurements were repeated among FRAM participants 4 years later (FRAM 2) for investigation of the progression of fat distribution changes, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. In FRAM 2, which is ongoing, investigators are also determining the associations of subclinical cardiovascular disease, as measured by carotid intimal-medial wall thickness, with HIV infection, fat distribution changes, insulin resistance, and other proatherogenic changes in serum lipid levels. The demographic characteristics of HIV-infected FRAM men and women were comparable to those reported from a national random sampling of HIV-infected men and women receiving medical care in the United States.

Recent clinical observations, however, have suggested that ETV may indeed demonstrate anti-HIV-1 activity. To investigate this question at a molecular level, kinetic studies were used to examine the interaction of 5'-triphosphate form of ETV with wild type (WT) HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant mutation M184V. Using single turnover kinetic assays, we found that HIV-1 WT RT and M184V RT could use the activated ETV triphosphate metabolite as a substrate for incorporation. The mutant displayed a slower incorporation rate, a lower binding affinity, and a lower incorporation efficiency with the 5'-triphosphate form of ETV compared with WT RT, suggesting a kinetic basis for resistance. Our results are supported by cell-based assays in primary human lymphocytes that show inhibition of WT HIV-1 replication by ETV and decreased susceptibility of the HIV-1 containing the M184V mutation. This study has important therapeutic implications as it establishes ETV as an inhibitor for HIV-1 RT and illustrates the mechanism of resistance by the M184V mutant."
6638,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are strong and independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) are considered at risk of developing cancer. However, the interaction between HFE gene mutations and hepatitis viruses for HCC development has not been systematically searched for. To assess the interaction between HFE gene mutations and exogenous risk factors in the risk of HCC occurrence, a case-only approach, in which just a series of patients is enrolled, was used. Three hundred three cirrhotic patients (231 males, 72 females) from five liver units in different geographic areas of Italy, who developed HCC during regular follow-up between January 1999 and March 2003, and whose blood DNA was available, were analyzed. In all subjects, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HCV and HFE gene mutations were assayed; alcohol intake was recorded by history. The interaction between HFE genotypes and hepatitis viruses for HCC was estimated by multivariate analysis adjusting for the confounding effect of alcohol intake, area of residence and months of follow-up. Of the 303 HCC cases, 12 (4.0%) were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, 93 (30.7%) for the H63D, and 198 (65.3%) homozygous for the wild allele. Multivariate analysis showed that C282Y heterozygous males were 3.8-fold (95% CI=1.0-15.2) more likely to be HBV positive and that H63D heterozygous females were 6.0-fold (95% CI=1.2-113.8) more likely to be HCV positive than wild type subjects. In conclusion, given the association between C282Y mutation and HBV infection in male patients with HCC, a careful evaluation and follow-up should be considered in the C282Y-positive subjects with hepatitis B virus related liver disease. The interaction between the H63D mutation and HCV, observed only in women, may reflect a higher sensitivity to H63D-induced iron metabolism abnormalities and a reduced antioxidant capability in the presence of an even minor increase of iron which may occur as a consequence of the coexistence of hepatitis C infection and heterozygosity for HH."
889,0.005,1.0000,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ genetic polymorphisms have been associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) outcomes. We aimed to determine impacts of HLA-DQ polymorphisms and their interactions with HBV mutations on the risks of liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). rs2856718 (A>G) and rs9275319 (A>G) were genotyped in 1342 healthy controls, 327 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance subjects, 611 asymptomatic HBsAg carriers (ASCs), 1144 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 734 LC patients, and 1531 HCC patients using quantitative PCR. HBV mutations were detected by direct sequencing. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to assess the factors and/or multiplicative interactions significantly associated with liver diseases. rs9275319 variant genotypes were inversely associated with HBV persistence compared to HBV natural clearance subjects. rs2856718 variant genotypes significantly increased LC risk compared to ASCs plus CHB patients (GG vs. AA: odds ratio [OR], 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.97 and AG+GG vs. AA: OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04-1.54) and decreased HCC risk compared to HCC-free HBV-infected subjects (AG vs. AA: OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.89 and AG+GG vs. AA: OR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.68-0.90). rs2856718 variant genotypes were significantly associated with an increased frequency of HBV A1726C mutation, a LC-risk, HCC-protective mutation, in genotype C. A rs9275319 variant genotype (GG) was significantly associated with an increased frequency of preS1 start codon mutation, an HCC-risk mutation, in genotype C. The interaction of rs2856718 AG+GG genotype with T1753V, a HCC-risk mutation, significantly reduced LC risk, with an OR of 0.26 (95% CI, 0.09-0.78); whereas the interaction of rs2856718 AG genotype with C1673T, a LC-risk mutation, significantly increased HCC risk, with an OR of 2.80 (95% CI, 1.02-7.66) in genotype C HBV-infected subjects. Conclusively, the HLA-DQ polymorphisms affect the risks of LC and HCC differently in chronic HBV-infected subjects, possibly via interacting with the HBV mutations. "
3311,0.005,1.0000,"From viral binding to the hepatocyte surface to extracellular virion release, the replication cycle of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) intersects at various levels with lipid metabolism; this leads to a derangement of the lipid profile and to increased viral infectivity. Accumulating evidence supports the crucial regulatory role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in lipoprotein metabolism. Notably, a complex interaction between HCV and PCSK9 has been documented. Indeed, either increased or reduced circulating PCSK9 levels have been observed in HCV patients; this discrepancy might be related to several confounders, including HCV genotype, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection and the ambiguous HCV-mediated influence on PCSK9 transcription factors. On the other hand, PCSK9 may itself influence HCV infectivity, inasmuch as the expression of different hepatocyte surface entry proteins and receptors is regulated by PCSK9. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence about the complex interaction between HCV and liver lipoprotein metabolism, with a specific focus on PCSK9. The underlying assumption of this review is that the interconnections between HCV and PCSK9 may be central to explain viral infectivity."

4964,0.005,1.0000,"The Tat-responsive region (TAR) element is a critical RNA regulatory element in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat, which is required for activation of gene expression by the transactivator protein Tat. Recently, we demonstrated by gel-retardation analysis that RNA polymerase II binds to TAR RNA and that Tat prevents this binding even when Tat does not bind to TAR RNA. These results suggested that direct interactions between Tat and RNA polymerase II may prevent RNA polymerase II pausing and lead to Tat-mediated increases in transcriptional elongation. To test this possibility, we performed protein interaction studies with RNA polymerase II and both the HIV-1 and the closely related HIV-2 Tat protein. These studies indicated that both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat proteins could specifically interact with RNA polymerase II. Mutagenesis of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat demonstrated that the basic domains of both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat proteins were required for this interaction. Furthermore, ""far Western"" analysis suggested that the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II was the site for interaction with Tat. The interactions between Tat and RNA polymerase II were of similar magnitude to those detected between RNA polymerase II and the cellular transcription factor RAP30, which stably associates with RNA polymerase II during transcriptional elongation. These studies are consistent with the model that RNA polymerase II is a cellular target for Tat resulting in Tat-mediated increases in transcriptional elongation from the HIV long terminal repeat."
6837,0.005,1.0000,"We carried out a study to determine the seroprevalence of HBV and HCV infections in HIV positive patients at a main referral center for HIV/AIDS in Iran. Serum samples from 201 HIV positive patients referring to a referral center for HIV/AIDS were analyzed for the presence of some hepatitis B (HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs) and Hepatitis C (anti-HCV) markers, during 2004- 2005. HBsAg was positive in 27 patients (13.4%), anti-HBc was positive in 60 patients (29.8%) and anti-HBs in 23 patients (11.4%). Anti-HCV Ab was positive in 135 of 201 (67.2%). HBV and HCV coinfection was observed in 73 of 201 (36.3%). The maximum prevalence of HBV-HIV and HCV-HIV coinfections were seen in intravenous drug users; 61.2% and 85.1%, respectively (P<0.0001). The minimum prevalence of HBV-HIV and HCV-HIV were seen in HIV patients' wife (HIV(+) patients who were infected by monogamous sexual contact with their HIV positive husband) both of them were 8% (P<0.0001). This study showed that HBV-HIV and HCV-HIV coinfections are significant in patients with HIV/AIDS in Iran. A greater relevance was observed in the association between HCV and HIV. This study suggests that it is necessary to investigate risk factors and risk groups for these infections in Iran."
1903,0.005,1.0000,"Substance abuse and addiction are highly prevalent in HIV-infected individuals. Substance abuse is an important comorbidity that affects the delivery and outcomes of HIV medical management. In this paper I will review data examining the associations between substance abuse and HIV treatment and potential strategies to improve outcomes in this population that warrant further investigation. Current - but not past - substance abuse adversely affects engagement in care, acceptance of antiretroviral therapy, adherence with therapy, and long-term persistence in care. Substance abuse treatment appears to facilitate engagement in HIV care, and access to evidence-based treatment for substance abuse is central to addressing the HIV epidemic. Strategies that show promise for HIV-infected substance abusers include integrated treatment models, directly observed therapy, and incentive-based interventions."
6050,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus infection are the most important infections transmitted by the parenteral route in hemodialysis patients. This study is the first report of prevalence of viral hepatitis and hepatitis C virus genotypes in southwest Iran among hemodialysis patients. A cross-sectional study was carried out among 214 hemodialysis patients of the Central hemodialysis unit, from March 2005 to August 2006. Serum samples were tested for HBsAg and anti-HCV using specific enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) kits and confirmed by PCR (HBV) and RT PCR (HCV). HCV genotypes were determined with HCV genotype specific primers using HCV genotype kit. Out of 214 hemodialysis patients, 34 were positive for anti-HCV (7.9%, 95% CI: 4.32-11.56) and 11 for HBsAg (5.1%, 95% CI: 2.18-8.1). The duration of treatment by hemo-dialysis was significantly associated with HBV and HCV positivity (P< 0.001). The predominant HCV genotype in the region was 1a (41.1%, 7/17), whilst genotypes 3a and 1b were found in 35.2% (6/17) and 23.5% (4/17) subjects, respectively. In conclusion although anti-HCV and HBsAg positivity in hemodialysis patients in Khuzestan province are smaller than those found in some other Iranian provinces and neighboring countries, they are still high. Enforcement of universal precautions in infection control, routine testing of patients, and serial determination of hepatic enzymes should be the common practice in dialysis centers in Iran."
9026,0.005,1.0000,"Many HIV-infected women are not realizing the benefits of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) despite significant advancements in treatment. Women in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES) are highly marginalized and struggle with multiple morbidities, unstable housing, addiction, survival sex, and elevated risk of sexual and drug-related harms, including HIV infection. Although recent studies have identified the heightened risk of HIV infection among women engaged in sex work and injection drug use, the uptake of HIV care among this population has received little attention. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the needs of women engaged in survival sex work and to assess utilization and acceptance of HAART. During November 2003, a baseline needs assessment was conducted among 159 women through a low-threshold drop-in centre servicing street-level sex workers in Vancouver. Cross-sectional data were used to describe the sociodemographic characteristics, drug use patterns, HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and status, and attitudes towards HAART. High rates of cocaine injection, heroin injection, and smokeable crack cocaine use reflect the vulnerable and chaotic nature of this population. Although preliminary findings suggest an overall high uptake of health and social services, there was limited attention to HIV care with only 9% of the women on HAART. Self-reported barriers to accessing treatment were largely attributed to misinformation and misconceptions about treatment. Given the acceptability of accessing HAART through community interventions and women specific services, this study highlights the potential to reach this highly marginalized group and provides valuable baseline information on a population that has remained largely outside consistent HIV care."
3456,0.005,1.0000,"The natural history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has never been studied according to the concept of liver fibrosis progression. The aim of this work was to assess the fibrosis progression rate in HIV-HCV coinfected patients and in patients infected by HCV only. A cohort of 122 HIV-HCV coinfected patients was compared with a control group of 122 HIV-negative HCV-infected patients. Groups were matched according to age, sex, daily alcohol consumption, age at HCV infection, and duration and route of HCV infection. The fibrosis progression rate was defined as the ratio between fibrosis stage (METAVIR scoring system) and the HCV duration. The prevalence of extensive liver fibrosis (METAVIR fibrosis scores 2, 3, and 4) and moderate or severe activity were higher in HIV-infected patients (60% and 54%, respectively) than in control patients (47% and 30%, respectively; P <.05 and P <.001, respectively). The median fibrosis progression rate in coinfected patients and in control patients was 0.153 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.117-0.181) and 0.106 (95% CI, 0.084-0.125) fibrosis units per year, respectively (P <.0001). HIV seropositivity (P <.0001), alcohol consumption (>50 g/d, P =.0002), age at HCV infection (<25 years old, P <.0001), and severe immunosuppression (CD4 count </=200 cells/microL, P <.0001) were associated with an increase in the fibrosis progression rate. In coinfected patients, alcohol consumption (>50 g/d), CD4 count (</=200 cells/microL), and age at HCV infection (<25 years old) (P <. 0001, respectively) were associated with a higher fibrosis progression rate. HIV seropositivity accelerates HCV-related liver fibrosis progression. In coinfected patients, a low CD4 count, alcohol consumption rate, and age at HCV infection are associated with a higher liver fibrosis progression rate."

Adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ were associated with a more rapid progression to AIDS (P < .001) and death (P < .001) and with a more rapid decline in CD4+ cell counts (P = .001). The median time to progression to AIDS was 14.9 months in subjects with adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ and 32.5 months in those without adverse reactions. After exclusion of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis from the case definition of AIDS, the differences in the rate of progression to AIDS between subjects with and without adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ were still highly significant (P = .004). A low CD4+ cell count at baseline and the use of antiretroviral agents before the start of prophylaxis were predictors of adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ but did not account for the difference in progression to AIDS between subjects with and without adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ. In a univariate analysis, the relative hazard of adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ for progression to AIDS was 2.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-4.28); in a multivariate analysis, it was 2.21 (95% CI, 1.29-3.81). The relative hazards of adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ for progression to AIDS with the exclusion of PCP and toxoplasmosis, CD4+ cell counts of <50/mm3, and death were 2.16 (95% CI, 1.25-3.72), 2.37 (95% CI, 1.36-4.12), and 3.21 (95% CI, 1.80-5.72), respectively. It is unclear whether adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ induce or merely predict progression of HIV disease."

Adherence, however, is difficult to achieve and maintain. The CAPRISA 058 study was conducted between 2007 and 2009 to test the efficacy of individualized motivational counselling to enhance ART adherence in South Africa. As part of the overall trial, a qualitative sub-study was conducted, including 30 individual interviews and four focus group discussions with patients in the first 9 months of ART initiation. Data were inductively analyzed, using thematic analysis, to identify themes central to ART adherence in this context. Four themes emerged that characterize the participants' experiences and high motivation to adhere to ART. Participants in this study were highly motivated to adhere, as they acknowledged that ART was 'life-giving', in the face of a large amount of morbidity and mortality. They were further supported by techniques of routine remembering, and highlighted the importance of good social support and access to supportive healthcare workers, to their continued success in negotiating their treatment. Participants in the current study told us that their adherence motivation is enhanced by free accessible care, approachable and supportive healthcare workers, broad social acceptance of ART, and past first-hand experiences with AIDS-related co-morbidity and mortality. Programs that include specific attention to these aspects of care will likely be successful in the long term."
6288,0.005,1.0000,"Zidovudine is widely prescribed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Trimethoprim and dapsone are commonly used in the management of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected patients. To examine the pharmacokinetic interactions among these drugs, eight HIV-infected patients (26 to 43 years old) with a mean CD4 count of 524.4 +/- 405.7 cells per mm3 received zidovudine (200 mg), trimethoprim (200 mg), and dapsone (100 mg) as single agents and in two- and three-drug combinations. Blood and urine samples were collected at a specified time and analyzed for zidovudine, zidovudine-glucuronide, trimethoprim, dapsone, and monoacetyl-dapsone concentrations under single-dose and steady-state conditions. Zidovudine did not influence the pharmacokinetic disposition of dapsone or trimethoprim. Dapsone had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of zidovudine. Trimethoprim significantly decreased the renal clearance of zidovudine by 58% (5.0 +/- 1.8 versus 2.1 +/- 0.5 ml/min/kg of body weight [P < 0.05]). There was a concurrent 54% decrease in the mean urinary recovery of zidovudine (11.7 +/- 3.5 versus 5.4 +/- 3.0 [P < 0.05]), and the metabolic ratio was decreased by 78% (0.32 +/- 0.4 versus 0.07 +/- 0.05 [P < 0.05]). The mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 6 h of the zidovudine-glucuronide/ zidovudine ratio was unchanged. We conclude that zidovudine, trimethoprim, and dapsone can be coadministered to patients with AIDS without significant pharmacokinetic interaction. However, in AIDS patients with liver impairment and impaired glucuronidation, doses of zidovudine may need to be decreased."

At the age of 15-19 years 90% have been infected, at the age of 40 years 100%. In a rubber plantation 30% had HBsAg, in the remaining 3 groups only 13% were HBsAg-positive. In the first group onchocerciasis was also a more frequent finding. However the parasitic infection was not the cause of the HBs-antigenemia. The HBsAg-concentration is mostly lower in the positive Liberians than in German HBsAg-carriers. Apparently the HBV caused frequently latent infections with low production of viral antigens in Liberia."
5102,0.005,1.0000,"The absence of expanded numbers of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-reactive CD8(+) T lymphocytes (CTLs) in patients chronically infected with HCV has led to the investigation of dendritic cell (DC) function in this population as a potential cause for this defect. Several studies have shown evidence for impaired monocyte-derived DCs in chronically infected patients. As it is difficult to reconcile these data with the fact that patients with chronic HCV are immune competent, we re-evaluated this finding, carefully assessing phenotypic markers and functional activity of patient DCs as compared with noninfected controls. In contrast to these prior studies, DCs from 13 of 13 chronic HCV patients expressed typical maturation markers. These mature DCs were capable of priming allogeneic T lymphocytes, as well as stimulating influenza-specific memory T cells. This finding is consistent with clinical and immunologic data that the deficit in the patient's immune repertoire is HCV-specific and suggests that refined models are required for understanding the role of DCs in HCV pathogenesis."
6505,0.005,1.0000,"Injection drug use (IDU) and HIV infection are important public health problems in Vietnam. The IDU population increased 70% from 2000 to 2004 and is disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS -- the country's second leading cause of death. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) share transmission routes with HIV and cause serious medical consequences. This study aimed to determine risk factors for acquisition of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections among IDUs in a northern province. We conducted a matched case-control study among active IDUs aged 18-45 who participated in a community-based survey (30-minute interview and serologic testing). Each HIV-infected IDU (case) was matched with one HIV-uninfected IDU (control) by age, sex (males only), and study site (128 pairs). Similar procedures were used for HBV infection (50 pairs) and HCV infection (65 pairs). Conditional logistic regression models were fit to identify risk factors for each infection. Among 309 surveyed IDUs, the HIV, HBV, and HCV prevalence was 42.4%, 80.9%, and 74.1%, respectively. Only 11.0% reported having been vaccinated against hepatitis B. While 13.3% of the IDUs reported sharing needles (past six months), 63.8% engaged in indirect sharing practices (past six months), including sharing drug solutions, containers, rinse water, and frontloading drugs. In multivariable models, sharing drugs through frontloading was significantly associated with HIV infection (odds ratio [OR]=2.8), HBV infection (OR=3.8), and HCV infection (OR=4.6). We report an unrecognized association between sharing drugs through frontloading and higher rates of HIV, HBV and HCV infections among male IDUs in Vietnam. This finding may have important implications for bloodborne viral prevention for IDUs in Vietnam."
8853,0.005,1.0000,"The seropositive and latency rates of HHV6 among IVDU with positive and negative HIV and control group were demonstrated. By immunofluorescent antibody test, no differences in the seropositive rates were found among these three groups. All groups had seropositive rate at the average 89% and GMT antibody 1:26. This meant that most of them had previous infection with HHV6. In addition, HHV6-DNA was determined and classified into subgroups: HHV6A and HHV6B, by polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence of HHV6-DNA indicated HHV6 latency in vivo. High latency rate of HHV6 was found in all three groups (the average 54%). Moreover, HHV6B (49%) had a higher frequency than HHV6A (5%); HHV6a was found only in IVDU with or without HIV infection. The result suggested that the HHV6 latency in IVDU with positive HIV may possibly transactivate HIV. The pathogenesis of HHV6 in AIDS patients should be further investigated. However, this research finding is useful for treatment, health care, prevention and control of AIDS in case of dual infections and latency of herpesvirus infection in AIDS."
3012,0.005,1.0000,"Obesity and chronic, treated HIV infection are both associated with persistent systemic inflammation and a similar constellation of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, but the combined effects of excess adiposity and HIV on circulating proinflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers previously shown to predict disease risk is not well described. We measured inflammation biomarker levels in 158 predominantly virologically suppressed adults on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a range of body mass index (BMI) values from normal to morbidly obese. We assessed the relationship between BMI and each biomarker using multivariable linear regression adjusted for age, sex, race, CD4(+) count, tobacco use, data source, protease inhibitor use, and routine nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) or aspirin use. Among normal-weight (n=48) and overweight participants (n=41; BMI <30 kg/m(2)), incremental BMI increases were associated with significantly higher serum highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP; β=2.47, p=0.02) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α receptor 1 levels (β=1.53, p=0.03), and significantly lower CD14 levels (β=0.84, p=0.01), but similar associations were not observed in the obese participants. Among the obese (n=69; BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)), however, higher serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6; β=1.30, p=0.02) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (β=1.77, p<0.01) were associated with higher BMI, a finding not observed among the nonobese. Among all participants, IL-6 and TNF-α receptor 1 levels were most closely associated with hsCRP (p<0.01). Further studies are needed to determine whether higher serum inflammation biomarker levels found in obese HIV-infected individuals on ART reflect an increased likelihood of adverse health outcomes, or if novel markers to estimate mortality and disease risk are needed in this population."
9357,0.005,1.0000,"High serum prolactin (PRL) levels and even hyperprolactinemia are a common finding in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms that may contribute to the rise of PRL. We measured serum PRL levels in 54 HIV-infected and 85 healthy age-matched men. The association between PRL levels among anti-PRL autoantibodies and other clinical variables in HIV-infected men was studied. We also evaluated the changes in serum PRL levels by chromatographic separation (affinity with protein G and gel filtration) after a 10-mg iv bolus of metoclopramide. HIV-infected men had higher serum PRL levels compared with healthy men. Sera from 9 of the 54 (16.7%)HIV-infected men were found to have hyperprolactinemia. Moreover, the anti-PRL autoantibody was present in four of nine (44.4%)HIV-infected men with hyperprolactinemia; it was also associated with hyperprolactinemic status. Serum total PRL levels were higher in HIV-infected men with anti-PRL autoantibodies than hyperprolactinemic HIV-infected men without anti-PRL autoantibodies; by contrast, free PRL levels were lower. In HIV-infected men with anti-PRL autoantibodies, gel filtration showed that big big PRL isoform was present as the predominant circulating form of PRL throughout each measurement after iv metoclopramide. By contrast, the predominant isoform of PRL in serum from healthy men and HIV-infected men who were anti-PRL autoantibody negative was little PRL. On the other hand, high serum total PRL levels were observed at each measurement throughout the metoclopramide test in HIV-infected men with anti-PRL autoantibodies; however, the serum free PRL levels were similar to those found in subjects without anti-PRL autoantibodies. These data demonstrated that anti-PRL autoantibodies are associated with hyperprolactinemic status in HIV-infected subjects, particularly in those with high serum PRL levels."
1338,0.005,1.0000,"Loss of CD4(+) T cells in the gut is necessary but not sufficient to cause AIDS in animal models, raising the possibility that a differential loss of CD4(+) T-cell subtypes may be important. We found that CD4(+) T cells that produce interleukin (IL)-17, a recently identified lineage of effector CD4(+) T-helper cells, are infected by SIV(mac251)in vitro and in vivo, and are found at lower frequency at mucosal and systemic sites within a few weeks from infection. In highly viremic animals, Th1 cells predominates over Th17 T cells and the frequency of Th17 cells at mucosal sites is negatively correlated with plasma virus level. Because Th17 cells play a central role in innate and adaptive immune response to extracellular bacteria, our finding may explain the chronic enteropathy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Thus, therapeutic approaches that reconstitute an adequate balance between Th1 and Th17 may be beneficial in the treatment of HIV infection."
5314,0.005,1.0000,"Pharmacokinetic and coagulation studies were carried out over a 12-week period with 11 asymptomatic hemophilia patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection receiving zidovudine (ZDV). The patients received 300 mg every 4 h while awake (the accepted dose at the time of this study); consecutive 24-h intravenous (i.v.) and 12-h oral pharmacokinetic studies were conducted at weeks 1, 6, and 12. Coagulation studies were conducted at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. The numbers of units of factors VIII and IX and cryoprecipitate transfused during the 12-week periods before, during, and after ZDV treatment were recorded. Following i.v. and oral ZDV administration, the concentration in plasma declined rapidly over the first 4 h, and in some patients, ZDV was still detectable at 4 to 10 h. The i.v. total clearances (means +/- standard deviations) were 14.9 +/- 7.3, 11.2 +/- 3.7, and 15.1 +/- 4.7 ml/min/kg of body weight. The i.v. distribution volumes were 1.08 +/- 0.5, 1.0 +/- 0.4, and 1.65 +/- 1.4 liters/kg. The bioavailabilities were 0.54 +/- 0.22, 0.46 +/- 0.19, and 0.59 +/- 0.13 at weeks 1, 6, and 12, respectively. The pattern of ZDV-glucuronide (GZDV) disposition was similar to that of ZDV, and the peak plasma GZDV-to-ZDV ratio was higher after oral dosing, consistent with first-pass metabolism. In some individuals, up to 33% of an i.v. dose was excreted unchanged. At weeks 6 and 12, greater than 300 mg of total ZDV (GZDV plus ZDV) was recovered in the urine of some patients, suggesting tissue redistribution. Concentration in plasma after oral ZDV administration were variable, both within and between patients. The von Willebrand antigen level consistently decreased throughout the study but was not accompanied by a parallel change in ristocetin cofactor A activity, and no clinical adverse effects on coagulation were noted. This study demonstrates that ZDV can be used in hemophilia patients without worsening of their bleeding tendencies. The clinical significance of decreased ZDV clearance and the prolonged terminal elimination phase of ZDV will require further study with patients receiving chronic ZDV."
9678,0.005,1.0000,"We report the occurrence of congenital toxoplasmosis in three infants born to HIV infected women who had high anti-toxoplasma IgG and negative IgM during pregnancy. We briefly reviewed available literature and discussed the possible transmission mechanisms of congenital toxoplasmosis among HIV infected pregnant women. Serum samples were tested for Toxoplasma gondii IgM and IgG antibodies using commercial enzyme immunoassay and IgG-avidity tests. In the first case, fetal death occurred at 28th week of gestation. In the second case, congenital toxoplasmosis was diagnosis at 6th month of life; and in the third case, an HIV-infected newborn, congenital toxoplasmosis was asymptomatic. These cases point out to the possibility of enhanced maternal-fetal transmission of T. gondii infection by HIV-infected women chronically infected, which may have important public health consequences, considering that increasing frequency of HIV-infection has been observed among women of childbearing age around the world."
2329,0.005,1.0000,"Despite considerable experience with single-dose, live, oral cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgR in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, the vaccine had not been evaluated in sub-Saharan Africa or on individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We therefore conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trial in 38 HIV-seropositive (without clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)) and 387 HIV-seronegative adults in Mali to assess its safety and immunogenicity. Adverse reactions (fever, diarrhoea and vomiting) were observed with similar frequency among vaccine and placebo recipients. The vaccine strain was not isolated from the coprocultures of any subject. The baseline geometric mean titre (GMT) of serum vibriocidal antibody was significantly lower in HIV-seropositives (1:23) than in HIV-seronegatives (1:65) (P = 0.002). Significant rises in vibriocidal antibody were observed in 71% of HIV-seronegatives and 58% of HIV-seropositives, and in 40% of HIV-seropositives with CD4+ counts below 500 per microliter. Following immunization, the peak vibriocidal GMT in HIV-seronegatives was 1:584 versus 1:124 in HIV-seropositives (P = 0.0006); in HIV-seropositives with CD4+ counts < 500 per microliter, the peak vibriocidal GMT was 1:40 (P = 0.03 versus other HIV-seropositives). CVD 103-HgR was safe in HIV-infected Malian adults, although serological responses were significantly attenuated among HIV-seropositives (particularly in those with CD4+ counts < 500 per microliter) relative to HIV-seronegatives. These results encourage further evaluations of this single-dose, oral cholera vaccine in high-risk populations such as refugees in sub-Saharan Africa."

Blacks [odds ratio (OR) = 9.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.1-15.9] and Hispanics (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.9-8.8) were at increased risk of HIV-1 infection, relative to non-Hispanic whites. Those who lived closer to New York City, injected drugs more frequently, used intravenous drugs for a longer duration, used shooting galleries, had greater numbers of sexual partners, had human cytomegalovirus (CMV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies, and had the lowest annual incomes were also at increased risk. However, none of these other factors accounted for the black and Hispanic HIV-1 risk in stratified analysis. Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, proximity to New York City, and number of drug injections in the past year each also remained significant, independent risk factors in a multivariate analysis. The increased HIV-1 risk of nonwhite IVDUs remained unexplained. Behavioral, sociologic, and/or biologic factors not identified in this study may modulate HIV-1 transmission dynamics in IVDUs."
1939,0.005,1.0000,"Improving health literacy is a necessary intervention for people with chronic health conditions to ensure adherence with long or life therapies and increase participation in self-care. While adherence is a multifactorial process, increasing health literacy among HIV-infected patients at all stages of living with HIV has been shown to improve treatment outcomes. In the era of rapid scale up of HIV care and treatment, little has been done to evaluate the utility of information, education, and communication (IEC) materials for increasing patient health literacy and how patients perceive such materials. Four patient-oriented print IEC brochures in Kiswahili were designed to be read at the clinic waiting areas and also carried home by patients to supplement the knowledge received from routine counselling during clinic visits. Brochures detail antiretroviral therapy and address common myths, side effects, types and management of opportunistic infections, and prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV. We conducted focus group discussions with HIV-infected patients to explore patient perceptions of IEC materials in the urban congested HIV care setting of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Groups of participants were recruited from eight public PEPFAR-supported HIV care and treatment centres in the city (N = 50). In this paper we present the results of those focus group discussions and introduce the print IEC materials as a pilot intervention in a Kiswahili-speaking setting where a need for additional health literacy exists. Further evaluation of these materials will follow as the data becomes available."
8914,0.005,1.0000,"Reports of an increased proportion of AIDS cases occurring in small and medium-sized cities suggest that the HIV epidemic may be spreading into locations that were previously characterized by their low HIV antibody prevalences. Studying the question of the geographic spread of the HIV infection epidemic (rather than the AIDS epidemic) has been difficult largely because most serial seroprevalence data have been gathered from cohorts of high risk individuals (e.g., homosexual/bisexual cohorts) in New York City, San Francisco, and other geographically circumscribed areas. The U.S. military applicant HIV screening data were used in the current report to examine rates and 24 month temporal trends in geographic areas characterized by their HIV endemicities. The data examined concern the seven most populous states and four hyperendemic metropolitan areas located within those states (New York City, Miami, Houston, and San Francisco). In the nonepidemic regions, seroprevalence rates increased among black and white applicants. In the four epidemic urban areas, only young black applicants had higher HIV seroprevalence rates during the second 12 month period. Six of the seven nonepidemic regions had positive HIV seroprevalence trends, and these trends were significant in Florida, California, Texas, Illinois, and Ohio. The increases in these regions were greater for young blacks (30% excess for year 2 vs. year 1) compared to young whites (12% excess for year 2 vs. year 1). These data provide evidence of birth year specific increases in seroprevalence over time occurring in presumed low HIV prevalence areas. These increases cannot be due to, but are observed in spite of, biases associated with increasing self-selection over time."
8636,0.005,1.0000,"Humans differ substantially with respect to susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We evaluated variants of nine host genes participating in the viral life cycle for their role in modulating HIV-1 infection. Alleles were assessed ex vivo for their impact on viral replication in purified CD4 T cells from healthy blood donors (n = 128). Thereafter, candidate alleles were assessed in vivo in a cohort of HIV-1-infected individuals (n = 851) not receiving potent antiretroviral therapy. As a benchmark test, we tested 12 previously reported host genetic variants influencing HIV-1 infection as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms in the nine candidate genes. This led to the proposition of three alleles of PML, TSG101, and PPIA as potentially associated with differences in progression of HIV-1 disease. In a model considering the combined effects of new and previously reported gene variants, we estimated that their effect might be responsible for lengthening or shortening by up to 2.8 years the period from 500 CD4 T cells/mul to <200 CD4 T cells/mul."
3642,0.005,1.0000,"We conducted a large-scale survey to determine the frequency and clinical significance of mutations in the pre-core region of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sera from 263 patients with chronic HBV infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified HBV DNA. Four major missense/nonsense mutations (M) were found: (M1) C-->T at nucleotide position 1856, Pro-->Ser at codon 15; (M2) G-->A at position 1896, Trp-->stop at codon 28; (M3) G-->A at position 1898, Gly-->Ser at codon 29; and (M4) G-->A at position 1899, Gly-->Asp at codon 29. The commonest conserved mutation was M0: T-->C at position 1858, Pro-->Pro at codon 15. We found that M1 and M2 were mutually exclusive, M3 was only found in association with M1, and M4 was predominantly found in association with M2. All patients with M1 but none of those with M2 had M0. The invariable coexistence of certain mutations in codon 15 and codons 28 and 29 and the mutual exclusion of other mutations in these two noncontiguous regions is related to the stem-loop structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence located in the precore/core region. M2 and M4 enhance the stability of the stem by providing two additional paired sites. M1 destroys an existing base pair. However, M1 only occurred in the presence of M0, which provides an extra paired site, and 50% of patients with M1 had M3, a compensatory mutation that restores base pairing at this site. Our data support the proposed secondary structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence. The primary function of the mutations in the pre-core region is to enhance stability of this secondary structure to ensure perpetuation of viral replication."
8310,0.005,1.0000,"Polymorphism in the HLA region of a chromosome is the major source of host genetic variability in HIV-1 outcome, but there is limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of protective class I alleles such as HLA-B57, -B27, and -B51. Taking advantage of a unique cohort infected with clade B' HIV-1 through contaminated blood, in which many variables such as the length of infection, the infecting viral strain, and host genetic background are controlled, we performed a comprehensive study to understand HLA-B51-associated HIV-1 control. We focused on the T cell responses against three dominant HLA-B51-restricted epitopes: Gag327-345(NI9) NANPDCKTI, Pol743-751(LI9) LPPVVAKEI, and Pol283-289(TI8) TAFTIPSI. Mutations in all three dominant epitopes were significantly associated with HLA-B51 in the cohort. A clear hierarchy in selection of epitope mutations was observed through epitope sequencing. L743I in position 1 of epitope LI9 was seen in most B51(+) individuals, followed by V289X in position 8 of the TI8, and then, A328S, in position 2 of the NI9 epitope, was also seen in some B51(+) individuals. Good control of viral load and higher CD4(+) counts were significantly associated with at least one detectable T cell response to unmutated epitopes, whereas lower CD4(+) counts and higher viral loads were observed in patients who had developed escape mutations in all three epitopes or who lacked T cell responses specific to these epitope(s). We propose that patients with HLA-B51 benefit from having multiple layers of effective defense against the development of immune escape mutations."
6523,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of human immunodeficience virus (HIV) infection among patients under renal replacement therapy varies, with estimates of 1% for Europe and 1.5% for the United States. Survival in HIV infected individuals receiving renal replacement therapy has improved since the introduction of high activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Current experience in renal transplantation in HIV-infected patients in the United States indicates that the three-year survival rate is similar to that of HIV-negative transplant recipients, with virological and immunological control of the infection by HAART and no increase in the number of opportunistic infections or tumors. The criteria for selecting renal transplantation candidates in this population are the following: no aids-defining events, CD4 cells > 200 cells/.l and undetectable viral load under HAART. In Spain, where most of these patients are former drug abusers, a two-year period of abstinence from cocaine and heroine abuse is also required, although patients can be participating in the methadone program. The main problems in the post-transplantation period have been interactions between HAART and immunosuppressive drugs, management of hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection and the high rate of acute rejection. To date, seven such renal transplantations have been performed in Spain, with favorable patient and graft survival and no progression to aids."
537,0.005,1.0000,"Candida samples were taken over a period of 2 years from 54 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive asymptomatic subjects to evaluate changes in yeast carriage, intensity of carriage, and genotype over time. Overall, we found that HIV-positive patients with CD4(+)-cell counts of between 200 and 400/microl had significantly more yeast colonization than healthy control subjects. Of the 54 patients, 11 developed thrush. We found that intensity of carriage in these 11 patients increased significantly in the progression from asymptomatic yeast carrier to an episode of oral thrush. Also, the most common yeast species isolated was Candida albicans; however, we did see a number of patients harboring multiple species at the same time. Using the C. albicans-specific probe Ca3, we found that 54% (n = 6) of the 11 patients who developed thrush maintained genetically similar strains throughout the study period, with minor genetic variations in all patients except one. Forty-six percent of these patients had either multiple strains throughout the study period (n = 2), strain replacement (n = 1), or species replacement (n = 2). Of the patients who had multiple strains, one (I4) was infected by two different strains of Candida dubliniensis distinguished by a recently developed species-specific probe. These results suggest that commensal strains colonizing HIV-positive individuals can undergo alterations prior to producing an episode of thrush."
9896,0.005,1.0000,"Lymph nodes are the major site of cell-to-cell transmission and replication of HIV-1. Trafficking of CD4+ T lymphocytes into lymph nodes provides a continual supply of susceptible target lymphocytes, and conversely, recruitment of CD8+ T lymphocytes may be critical for the host response that attempts to control HIV-1 replication. The present study was undertaken as no detailed assessment of lymphocyte subpopulations in HIV-1-infected lymph nodes has previously been reported. Peripheral blood and single-cell suspensions prepared from lymph nodes of patients with HIV-1 and control subjects were analysed using three-colour flow cytometry. Approximately 80% of the lymphocytes in control lymph nodes were CD3+ T lymphocytes, of which over 65% were CD4+. The majority of the CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes obtained from both lymph nodes and blood of control subjects were immunologically naive (CD45RA+). By contrast, in HIV-1-infected patients there was a significant reduction in the proportion of CD4+ T lymphocytes and an expansion of the CD8+ T lymphocyte subset in both lymph nodes and peripheral blood. Furthermore, a high proportion of these T lymphocytes displayed a marker for immunological memory (CD45RO+). T lymphocytes derived from HIV-1-infected lymph nodes also showed altered expression of the adhesion molecules, L-selectin and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), but not leucocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1). In an in vitro adhesion assay, lymphocytes from HIV-1-infected nodes were significantly more adhesive than control lymphocytes on fibronectin, as well as recombinant human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) substrates. This combination of altered lymphocyte subpopulations in the HIV-1-infected lymph nodes, as well as enhanced adhesion phenotype and function, suggests that T lymphocyte traffic to lymph nodes in HIV disease may be an important determinant of pathogenesis."
1476,0.005,1.0000,"In the early 1990s, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection associated with possible reuse of syringes and needles was reported among children in Romanian orphanages. These findings led health-care workers to use new disposable syringes and needles for administering injections. Bythe late 1990s, reports suggested that new disposable syringes and needles had become standard for all injections. However, surveillance data collected by the Romanian Ministry of Health (MoH) during 1997-1998 indicated that acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was associated with receiving injections among children aged <5 years. In Romania, injection frequently is used to administer medication, and nurses administer most injections. To identify the practices that might have resulted in injection-associated HBV transmission, selected clinic and hospital nurses were surveyed. This report summarizes the findings of the survey, which indicated that although nurses used new disposable syringes and needles, other inadequate infection-control practices might explain injection-associated HBV transmission. Results of the survey were used by the Romanian Coalition to Prevent Nosocomial Infections to prepare standards for injection safety to protect patients and health-care workers from HBV infection."
6562,0.005,1.0000,"HLA-B27- and -B57-positive HIV-infected humans have long been associated with control of HIV replication, implying that CD8(+) T cell responses contribute to control of viral replication. In a similar fashion, 50% of Mamu-B*08-positive Indian rhesus macaques control SIVmac239 replication and become elite controllers with chronic-phase viremia <1000 viral RNA copies/ml. Interestingly, Mamu-B*08-restricted SIV-derived epitopes appeared to match the peptide binding profile for HLA-B*2705 in humans. We therefore defined a detailed peptide-binding motif for Mamu-B*08 and investigated binding similarities between the macaque and human MHC class I molecules. Analysis of a panel of approximately 900 peptides revealed that despite substantial sequence differences between Mamu-B*08 and HLA-B*2705, the peptide-binding repertoires of these two MHC class I molecules share a remarkable degree of overlap. Detailed knowledge of the Mamu-B*08 peptide-binding motif enabled us to identify six additional novel Mamu-B*08-restricted SIV-specific CD8(+) T cell immune responses directed against epitopes in Gag, Vpr, and Env. All 13 Mamu-B*08-restricted epitopes contain an R at the position 2 primary anchor and 10 also possess either R or K at the N terminus. Such dibasic peptides are less prone to cellular degradation. This work highlights the relevance of the Mamu-B*08-positive SIV-infected Indian rhesus macaque as a model to examine elite control of immunodeficiency virus replication. The remarkable similarity of the peptide-binding motifs and repertoires for Mamu-B*08 and HLA-B*2705 suggests that the nature of the peptide bound by the MHC class I molecule may play an important role in control of immunodeficiency virus replication."

In HBV mono-infected individuals, core deletion mutants are associated with more aggressive liver disease. As HIV accelerates HBV liver disease progression, we hypothesized that HIV-HBV co-infected individuals have increased frequency of core mutations including deletions. To test this hypothesis, we have analysed genome-length sequences of HBV DNA from patients both prior to and during antiviral therapy."
119,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in HIV-positive individuals. Although HBV vaccination is mandatory for HIV-positive individuals with negative-HBV markers, lower rates of protection are achieved. HIV infection accelerates the course of liver disease caused by chronic HBV infection, leading to end-stage hepatic illness and increasing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Anti-HBV active agents, especially tenofovir, improve outcomes. Lamivudine alone should be limited to patients with low serum HBV-DNA levels, since selection of drug resistance often compromises long-term benefits, leads to cross-resistance with other antivirals, and favors the potential emergence of HBV-vaccine escape mutants. "
4564,0.005,1.0000,"In HIV-infected individuals, coinfection with HBV and/or HCV is common because of shared modes of transmission. It is known that HIV accelerates progression of liver disease and results in increased morbidity and mortality associated with viral hepatitis, but it is less clear if viral hepatitis has a direct effect on HIV. Treatment of viral hepatitis improves outcomes and should be considered in all HIV-infected patients. Treatment of HBV without concurrent treatment of HIV is risky because resistance can occur in both viruses if regimens are not carefully chosen. "
944,0.005,1.0000,"For HIV-infected children, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is often assessed by caregiver report but there are few data on their validity. We conducted prospective evaluations with 191 children ages 0-14 years and their caregivers over 6 months in western Kenya to identify questionnaire items that best predicted adherence to ART. Medication Event Monitoring Systems(®) (MEMS, MWV/AARDEX Ltd., Switzerland) electronic dose monitors were used as external criterion for adherence. We employed a novel variable selection tool using the LASSO technique with logistic regression to identify items best correlated with dichotomized MEMS adherence (≥90 or <90 % doses taken). Nine of 48 adherence items were identified as the best predictors of adherence, including missed or late doses in the past 7 days, problems giving the child medicines, and caregiver-level factors like not being present at medication taking. These items could be included in adherence assessment tools for pediatric patients. "
8784,0.005,1.0000,"Pigtailed macaques infected with a virulent human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) strain develop renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which morphologically resembles aspects of human HIV-associated TMA. Apoptotic cell death of microvascular endothelial cells might be a pathogenetic clue to this disease. For defining further the pattern of cellular injury in this model, serial kidney sections of 58 macaques infected with HIV-2 and 7 uninfected controls were studied by routine microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, and immunohistochemistry for single-stranded DNA, p53, the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1 peptide product, caspase-3, and the proliferation marker Ki67. Selected cases were further evaluated by in situ end labeling and transmission electron microscopy. Kidneys of 13 HIV-2-infected animals contained a pattern of cellular injury, which was characterized by (1) nuclear swelling with an ultrastructural morphology different from apoptotic nuclei, (2) sharply demarcated areas of renal cells with chromatin nicks (TUNEL positive) and single-stranded DNA, (3) absence of an inflammatory or proliferative response, (4) upregulation of p53 and loss of at least one cellular differentiation marker (Wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1), (5) a tight correlation with the diagnosis of renal TMA, and (6) a contrast between profound changes in the renal cellular morphology and the apparently unaffected clinical condition of the host. This pattern of injury, which shares some features of both apoptotic and oncotic necrosis, might be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated renal TMA in this model."
3301,0.005,1.0000,"Quantitative PCR assays used to monitor hepatitis B virus (HBV) load differ in their ability to detect different HBV variants. This study evaluated the performance of the Abbott RT PCR assay for quantitating DNA from different HBV genotypes and from HBV variants bearing HBsAg gene mutations. The study was performed on a randomly-selected sample with a viral load >6logIU/mL for each genotype and on 25 HBsAg variants. Each sample was assayed using the Abbott RT assay and with the Roche Cobas AmpliPrep-Cobas TaqMan as a reference method. All HBV genotypes were detected with the Abbott RT assay with an equivalent dynamic range (1-8logIU/mL). For each genotype, the data suggest that the assay was linear over the entire dilution range (r(2): 0.985-0.995). For the 25 HBsAg variants, viral titres determined with the two assays correlated well (r(2): 0.929). The mean difference between the two methods was -0.295 (95% CI: -0.520 to -0.071). The difference was lower than 1log unit in all but two cases. In conclusion, the Abbott RT assay can detect and quantify DNA from different HBV variants with equivalent performance and is thus suitable for routine monitoring of patients with chronic HBV infections."
156,0.005,1.0000,"Indications of liver transplantation are extensive, but deceased donation does not meet the demand. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive grafts used to be discarded in the past. The aim of this study was to examine viral activity and outcome of HBsAg-positive deceased grafts transplanted to HBsAg-positive recipients. Eleven HBsAg-positive deceased grafts were transplanted to HBsAg-positive patients with acute liver failure (3 patients), hepatocellular carcinoma (6 patients) and repeatedly bleeding varices (2 patients). Postoperatively, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was treated by a combination of antiviral nucleoside and nucleotide analogues. HBV DNA and HBsAg were measured periodically. The median (interquartile) model of end-stage liver disease score for the recipients was 19 (16-32) with a range from 11 to 40. HBV DNA was detected in 6 patients with a range from 61 to 1083 IU/mL before transplantation. After transplantation, HBV DNA was detected in 4 patients in the first month and 2 patients in the 6th month and became undetectable for all patients at end of the first year. The quantitative HBsAg ranged from 0.86 to 241.1 IU/mL at 6 months and 0.34 to 238.5 IU/mL at 24 months (P = .135). Three of the patients died in the early phase, and the other patients were followed up for 40.0 ± 19.2 months with normal liver function. In conclusion, HBsAg-positive deceased liver grafts function well with minimal viral activity under treatment of combined antiviral nucleoside and nucleotide analogues. Use of HBsAg-positive deceased grafts is feasible and increases the donor pool to rescue dying patients."
5555,0.005,1.0000,"One hundred and seventy five subjects with chronic liver diseases which included patients with chronic active hepatitis (90), liver cirrhosis (31) and asymptomatic hepatitis B carriers (54), were included in the study. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) specific DNA-polymerase activity and HBe-markers were tested as markers of HBV-multiplication. In HBsAg positive samples, DNA-P activity was positive in 44.4% of the HBV carriers, 52.9% of the patients with chronic active hepatitis and 81.8% of the patients with liver cirrhosis. The corresponding figures for the presence of HBeAg in these groups were 18.5, 26.5 and 45.5% respectively. Virus multiplication was also observed in 41.1 and 44.4% patients with chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis respectively, in the absence of HBsAg. The results of the present study show that hepatitis B virus is the most important etiological factor of chronic liver diseases in India. Most of our patients of chronic liver diseases seems to have contacted HBV infection as young adults and the mode of transmission is likely to be horizontal rather than vertical. The virus replicating markers correlate well with the severity of the liver injury and decreased with the age. DNA-P activity is a more sensitive marker of viral multiplication than HBeAg. Viral multiplication was also found to occur in the absence of the usual HBV markers. Continued viral multiplication in patients with chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis is implicated in continued liver injury and progressive liver disease."
205,0.005,1.0000,"Requirements for the establishment of productive infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in primary monocytes were investigated. In vitro, monocytes rendered susceptible for infection after at least a 2-d culture, but when cultured in the presence of differentiation-inducing agent IL-4, accelerated susceptibility was seen. Complete resistance to HIV-1 infection was observed in monocytes that had been treated for 5 d with rIL-4, and comparable results were obtained with other differentiation inducers such as dexamethasone or 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2vitD3). The inhibition of productive infection was not caused by downregulation of CD4 expression or HIV-1 transcription, nor by intracellular accumulation of virions. Since treatment with rIL-4, dexamethasone, or 1,25(OH)2vitD3 also resulted in complete inhibition of monocyte proliferation, we studied whether establishment of productive infection in monocytes is proliferation dependent. Irradiation or mitomycin-C treatment within 24 h after inoculation prevented productive HIV-1 infection of monocytes, suggesting a proliferation-dependent step early in the virus replication cycle. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed the presence of only incomplete proviral DNA species in non-proliferating monocytes, indicating restriction of viral replication at the level of reverse transcription. Thus, in analogy with HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells, proliferation of monocytes during differentiation into macrophages is a prerequisite for productive infection with HIV."
5669,0.005,1.0000,"The demand for dental treatment by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals is rising. Some professionals are still reluctant to treat these patients, despite the extremely low likelihood of professional transmission, which increases only in patients with a very elevated viral load. The complications rate after dental intervention is very low, even in patients with considerable immunologic deterioration. The dentist should pay special attention to the general clinical situation and immunologic and HIV virologic status of the seropositive patient, and to the presence of hemostasis alterations or of other concomitant diseases. Antiretroviral or any other drug treatments must also be recorded, in order to avoid possible interactions with clinician-prescribed drugs. Tooth extraction is the most common dental treatment and requires no antibiotic therapy except in cases of neutropenia or severe immunosuppression. Other dental treatments do not require special precautions, and the complications index among these patients is similar to that among the uninfected patient population. With this background, there is a need to make the clinician-in-training aware of the importance of regular dental health checkups as part of the health care routine of HIV-infected patients and to familiarize the clinician with their management, while not disregarding the unquestionable requirement to carry out the general and specific prevention measures to be adopted in all cases."
2169,0.005,1.0000,"Maintaining greater than 95% adherence to antiretroviral medication is necessary in order to have the greatest therapeutic impact on HIV infection. Furthermore, evidence suggests that adherence rates of between 70% and 89% are significantly associated with viral rebound and the development of drug resistance. Adherence rates at and above the 95% level are difficult for patients to achieve and maintain. Our aim was to determine if an adherence intervention could improve adherence among patients attending an ambulatory care clinic at a large public hospital. The intervention was delivered by a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals and consisted of education coupled with the provision of devices designed to assist patient memory and adherence. A crucial component of the intervention consisted of the identification of patient specific barriers to adherence and the development of strategies to circumvent these problems. Adherence was assessed using patient self-report over the past 4, 7, and 28 days and by calculation of the Morisky score. The study was conducted as a randomised controlled trial using the stepped wedge design with a total of 68 subjects randomised to receive the intervention over a 20-week period. Adherence before and after the intervention formed the analysis. There was a significant decrease in the number of missed doses over the past 4 (1.9 to 1.0, p < 0.001), 7 (3.0 to 1.8, p < 0.001) and 28 (7.4 to 4.2, p < 0.001) days and a decrease in the Morisky score, indicating an improvement in medication taking behaviour (1.3 to 0.5 p < 0.001)."
3593,0.005,1.0000,"Virus-specific CD8+ T cells play an important role in controlling viral infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, during chronic HIV infection, virus-specific CD8+ T cells undergo functional exhaustion, lose effector functions and fail to control viral infection. HIV-specific CD8 T cells expressing high levels of co-inhibitory molecule programmed death-1 (PD-1) during the chronic infection and are characterized by lower proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic abilities. Although, antiretroviral therapy has resulted in dramatic decline in HIV replication, there is no effective treatment currently available to eradicate viral reservoirs or restore virus-specific T or B-cell functions that may complement ART in order to eliminate the virus. In recent years, studies in mice and non-human primate models of HIV infection demonstrated the functional exhaustion of virus-specific T and B cells could be reversed by blockade of interaction between PD-1 and its cognate ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2). In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of PD-1 pathway in HIV/SIV infection and discuss the beneficial effects of PD-1 blockade during chronic HIV/SIV infection and its potential role as immunotherapy for HIV/AIDS.

2848,0.005,1.0000,"A novel technology combining replication- and integration-defective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vectors with genetically modified dendritic cells was developed in order to induce T-cell immunity. We introduced the vector into dendritic cells as a plasmid DNA using polyethylenimine as the gene delivery system, thereby circumventing the problem of obtaining viral vector expression in the absence of integration. Genetically modified dendritic cells (GMDC) presented viral epitopes efficiently, secreted interleukin 12, and primed both CD4(+) and CD8(+) HIV-specific T cells capable of producing gamma interferon and exerting potent HIV-1-specific cytotoxicity in vitro. In nonhuman primates, subcutaneously injected GMDC migrated into the draining lymph node at an unprecedentedly high rate and expressed the plasmid DNA. The animals presented a vigorous HIV-specific effector cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte (CTL) response as early as 3 weeks after a single immunization, which later developed into a memory CTL response. Interestingly, antibodies did not accompany these CTL responses, indicating that GMDC can induce a pure Th1 type of immune response. Successful induction of a broad and long-lasting HIV-specific cellular immunity is expected to control virus replication in infected individuals."
5309,0.005,1.0000,"The importance of HLA class I-restricted CD8 T-cell responses in the control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is generally accepted. While several studies have shown an association of certain HLA class I alleles with slower disease progression, it is not fully established whether this effect is mediated by HIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses restricted by these alleles. In order to study the influence of the HLA class I alleles on the HIV-specific CD8 T-cell response and on viral control, we have assessed HIV-specific epitope recognition, plasma viral load, and expression of HLA class I alleles in a cohort of HIV-seropositive bar workers. Possession of the HLA class I alleles B5801, B8101, and B0702 was associated with a low median viral load and simultaneously with a broader median recognition of Gag epitopes compared to all other HLA alleles (twofold increase) (P = 0.0035). We further found an inverse linear relationship between the number of Gag epitopes recognized and the plasma viral load (R = -0.36; P = 0.0016). Particularly, recognition of multiple epitopes within two regions of Gag (amino acids [aa] 1 to 75 and aa 248 to 500) was associated with the maintenance of a low steady-state viremia, even years after acute infection."

Dosage individualization based on plasma concentration monitoring might, however, be indicated. This study aimed to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of indinavir in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus to characterize interpatient and intrapatient variability and to build up a Bayesian approach for dosage adaptation. A population analysis was performed with the NONMEM computer program with 569 plasma samples from a cohort of 239 unselected patients receiving indinavir. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption was adapted, and the influences of clinical characteristics on oral clearance (CL) and distribution volume (V) were examined. Predicted average drug exposure and trough and peak concentrations were derived for each patient and correlated with efficacy and toxicity markers. The population estimates of CL were 32.4 liters/h for female and 42.0 liters/h for male patients; oral V was 65.7 liters; and the rate constant of absorption (K(a)) was 1.0 h(-1). CL decreased by 63% with ritonavir intake and was moderately correlated to body weight. Both interpatient variability, best assigned to oral CL (coefficient of variation [CV], 39%) and K(a) (CV, 67%), and intrapatient variability were large (CV, 41%; standard deviation, 670 microg/liter). In conclusion, initial indinavir dosage should be decided according to ritonavir intake and sex, prior to plasma concentration measurements. The high interpatient pharmacokinetic variability represents an argument for therapeutic drug monitoring."
9497,0.005,1.0000,"First generation HIV vaccines may have limited ability to prevent infection. Instead, they may delay the onset of AIDS or reduce the infectiousness of vaccinated individuals who become infected. To assess the population level effects of such a vaccine, we formulate a deterministic model for the spread of HIV in a homosexual population in which the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to treat HIV infection is incorporated. The basic reproduction number R(0) is obtained under this model. We then expand the model to include the potential effects of a prophylactic HIV vaccine. The reproduction number R(f) is derived for a population in which a fraction f of susceptible individuals is vaccinated and continues to benefit from vaccination. We define f(*) as the minimum vaccination fraction for which R(f )< or =1 and describe situations in which it equals the critical vaccination fraction necessary to eliminate disease. When R(0) is large or an HIV vaccine is only partially effective, the critical vaccination fraction may exceed one. HIV vaccination, however, may still reduce the prevalence of disease if the reduction in infectiousness is at least as great as the reduction in the rate of disease progression. In particular, a vaccine that reduces infectiousness during acute infection may have an important public health impact especially if coupled with counseling to reduce risky behavior."

1061,0.005,1.0000,"The association of antiretroviral agents plus interleukin 2 (IL-2) represents an efficient approach to the treatment of HIV+ subjects. While the effects of IL-2 on the immune system have been investigated, little is known concerning its impact on HIV dynamics. Two antiretroviral drugs control HIV viremia, but have minimal effects on the proviral load, a predictor of disease progression and response to therapy. The aim of this study was to define the effect of rIL-2 on HIV proviral copy numbers and its relationship to changes in CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Twelve HIV+ patients with CD4 cell counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3 were treated with six cycles of subcutaneous rIL-2, in combination with zidovudine and didanosine. This regimen resulted in a rapid and durable decrease in proviral load in the peripheral blood, in an increase in CD8+ lymphocytes, and in the emergence of a CD4+CD45RA+ T subset. These results demonstrate that the rationale for IL-2 administration to HIV+ patients may depend not only on its effects on the immune system, but also on the reduction of the number of infected cells, reinforcing the notion that IL-2 can have a favorable impact on the natural history of HIV infection."

To avoid selection during propagation in CD4+ target cells, we transfected 293 cells and used the supernatants from these cells as challenge viruses for tropism studies after titration on human PBMC. Despite differences in the V3 loop of the major variants found in brain and lung compared to lymphoid tissues all recombinant HIV clones obtained showed identical cell tropism and replicative kinetics. After infection of human PBMC these viruses replicated with similar kinetics, with a slow/low-titer, non-syncytium-inducing phenotype. In contrast to the prediction of macrophage tropism, drawn from the V3 loop sequence, none of these viruses infected monocyte-derived macrophages. The challenge of blood dendritic cells by these recombinant viruses in the presence of tumor necrosis factor alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-4 resulted in a productive infection only after adding stimulated CD4+ T lymphocytes. Therefore, the biological properties of the HIV-1 variants derived from nonlymphoid tissue of this patient did not differ from those of HIV-1 variants from lymphoid tissue with respect to tropism for primary cells such as PBMC, macrophages, and blood dendritic cells."
4590,0.005,1.0000,"To be effective, a vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) must induce virus-specific T-cell responses and it must be safe for use in humans. To address these issues, we developed a recombinant vaccinia virus DIs vaccine (rDIsSIVGag), which is nonreplicative in mammalian cells and expresses the full-length gag gene of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Intravenous inoculation of 10(6) PFU of rDIsSIVGag in cynomologus macaques induced significant levels of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) spot-forming cells (SFC) specific for SIV Gag. Antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferative responses were also induced and were temporally associated with the peak of IFN-gamma SFC activity in each macaque. In contrast, macaques immunized with a vector control (rDIsLacZ) showed no significant induction of antigen-specific immune responses. After challenge with a highly pathogenic simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), CD4(+) T lymphocytes were maintained in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues of the immunized macaques. The viral set point in plasma was also reduced in these animals, which may be related to the enhancement of virus-specific intracellular IFN-gamma(+) CD8(+) cell numbers and increased antibody titers after SHIV challenge. These results demonstrate that recombinant DIs has potential for use as an HIV/AIDS vaccine."
7495,0.005,1.0000,"We have developed a murine model to study the involvement of dendritic cells (DC) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) routing from an inoculation site to the lymph nodes (LN). Murine bone marrow-derived DC migrate to the draining LN within 24 h after subcutaneous injection. After incubation of these cells with heat-inactivated (Hi) HIV type 1 (HIV-1), HIV RNA sequences were detected in the draining LN only. Upon injection of DC pulsed with infectious HIV, the virus recovered in the draining LN was still able to productively infect human T cells. After a vaginal challenge with Hi HIV-1, the virus could be detected in the iliac and sacral draining LN at 24 h after injection. After an intravenous challenge, the virus could be detected in peripheral LN as soon as 30 min after injection. The specific depletion of a myeloid-related LN DC population, previously shown to take up blood macromolecules and to translocate them into the LN, prevented HIV transport to LN. Together, our data demonstrate the critical role of DC for HIV routing to LN after either a vaginal or an intravenous challenge, which does not require their infection. Therefore, despite the fact that the mouse is not infectable by HIV, this small animal model might be useful to test preventive strategies against HIV."

We examined the efficiency of transduction and transgene expression in adult bone marrow (BM)- and umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived CD34+ cells induced to differentiate into T cells and monocytes in vitro with an MuLV-based vector encoding the neomycin resistance gene and an intracellular antibody directed against the Tat protein of HIV-1 (sFvtat1-Ckappa). The expression of the marker gene and the effects of antiviral construct on subsequent challenge with monocytotropic and T cell-tropic HIV-1 isolates were monitored in vitro in purified T cells and monocytes generated in culture from the transduced CD34+ cells. Transduction efficiencies of CD34+ cells ranged between 22 and 27%. Differentiation of CD34+ cells into T cells or monocytes was not significantly altered by the transduction process. HIV-1 replication in monocytes and CD4+ T cells derived from CD34+ cells transduced with the intracellular antibody gene was significantly reduced in comparison with the degree of HIV replication seen in monocytes and CD4+ T cells derived from CD34+ cells transduced with the neomycin resistance gene alone. Further, T cells and monocytes derived from CD34+ cells transduced with the intracellular antibody gene were demonstrated to express the sFvtat1-Ckappa transgene by RT-PCR and had a selective growth advantage in cultures that had been challenged with HIV-1. These data demonstrate that sFvtat1-Ckappa inhibits HIV-1 replication in T cells and monocytes developing from CD34+ cells and supports the continuing development of a stem cell gene therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection."

Four cynomolgus monkeys infected for greater than 600 days with a chimeric virus composed of SIVmac 239 expressing the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 HXBc2 env, tat, and rev genes were challenged intravenously with 100 animal infectious doses of the J5 clone of SIVmac 32H, an isolate derived by in vivo passage of SIVmac 251.

The aim of this study was to determine (1) the breadth of the protection after repeated challenges of monkeys with SIV homologous strains of different pathogenicity, (2) the genotypic stability of the live virus vaccine, (3) whether the protection might depend on cellular resistance to superinfection, and (4) whether immunogenic stimuli such as recall antigens could reactivate the replication of the C8 virus. To address these goals, the monkeys were challenged at 40 weeks after C8 infection with 50 MID50 of cloned SIVmac251, BK28 grown on macaque cells. They were protected as indicated by several criteria, including virus isolation, anamnestic serological responses, and viral diagnostic PCR. At 92 weeks after the first challenge, unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from protected monkeys were susceptible to the in vitro infection with SIVmac32H, spl. At 143 weeks after C8 infection, the four protected monkeys were rechallenged with 50 MID50 of the pathogenic SIVmac32H, spl grown on macaque cells. Once again, they were protected. The C8 virus remained genotypically stable, and depletion of CD4(+) cells was not observed during approximately 3 years of follow-up. In contrast, it was found that the infection with SIVmac32H, spl induced CD4(+) cell depletion in three of three control monkeys. Of importance, stimulation with tetanus toxoid, although capable of inducing specific humoral and T cell proliferative responses, failed to induce a detectable reactivation of C8 virus."

This distinction is critical, as effective strategies for blocking cell-free and cell-associated virus transmission may be different. We describe a novel ex vivo model system that utilizes sealed human colonic mucosa explants and demonstrate in both the ex vivo model and in vivo using the rectal challenge model in rhesus monkeys that HIV-1-infected lymphocytes can transmit infection across the mucosa more efficiently than cell-free virus. These findings may have significant implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of mucosal transmission of HIV-1 and for the development of strategies to prevent HIV-1 transmission. "

Aminotransferase levels were normalised and clearance of HCV RNA was obtained in the first month of the therapy. After 19 months of follow-up, he had undetectable levels of HCV RNA so sustained response (clearance of HCV RNA and normalisation of aminotransferases at least six months after cessation of therapy) was achieved.

C. parvum-specific antibodies and specific secretory antibodies were determined by ELISA in saliva and sera from 50 HIV-1-infected patients, 27 healthy adults, and 21 healthy children. Despite lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts, patients with chronic cryptosporidiosis had increased levels of C. parvum-specific antibodies in saliva and serum and higher specific secretory antibody levels in saliva than did controls.

Although the HCW was initially infected with an SI strain, within 75 days of infection the isolate became non-SI and remained so for > or = 635 days. Even though the AIDS patient had a zidovudine-resistant virus, the HCW was infected with a zidovudine-sensitive virus. Plasma RNA levels peaked 20 days after infection, declined rapidly within 2 weeks, and remained stable for the duration of follow-up. Similarly, the HCW's CD4 lymphocyte count remained stable throughout the study.

Envelope sequences corresponding to the first 752 amino acids of HIV-1(HTLV-IIIB) clone BH10 were obtained from clones of cultured virus and sequenced. Three env clones obtained shortly after infection differed among themselves at only seven nucleotide positions, resulting in one amino acid substitution and one frameshift mutation. These envelope sequences were as similar to the envelope sequences of various IIIB clones as the latter were to each other. env divergence increased over the course of infection. However, the overall diversity in env clones obtained two or more years after infection was still comparable to that among IIIB env clones from the original IIIB culture. Multiple clones of partial env gene sequences containing the V3 loop were also obtained directly from uncultured PBMCs by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The env sequences of these clones were generally similar to those of the cultured viruses. Within the V3 region, the earliest isolates retained the sequence of the HXB2 clone from IIIB. Clones obtained later showed a progressive divergence in V3. An A-to-T substitution within the GPGRAF sequence at the tip of the V3 loop was observed within 1 year after infection, and this mutation predominated in all subsequent isolates. Antibodies against the V3 loops of IIIB and divergent 1987 and 1990 LW isolates appeared simultaneously in laboratory worker serum and persisted with no significant differences in titer. Furthermore, neutralization studies with autologous sequential sera suggested selection for the A-to-T change in V3 was not due to V3-directed antibodies. These results demonstrate a surprising homogeneity among env sequences of HIV-1 from an infected laboratory worker, perhaps because the initial infection originated from a relatively homogeneous population of tissue culture-adapted virus."

In the health care setting, blood-borne pathogen transmission occurs predominantly by percutaneous or mucosal exposure of workers to the blood or body fluids of infected patients. Prospective studies of HCWs have estimated that the average risk for HIV transmission after a percutaneous exposure is approximately 0.3%, the risk of HBV transmission is 6 to 30%, and the risk of HCV transmission is approximately 1.8%. To minimize the risk of blood-borne pathogen transmission from HCWs to patients, all HCWs should adhere to standard precautions, including the appropriate use of hand washing, protective barriers, and care in the use and disposal of needles and other sharp instruments. Employers should have in place a system that includes written protocols for prompt reporting, evaluation, counseling, treatment, and follow-up of occupational exposures that may place a worker at risk of blood-borne pathogen infection.

Our study aimed to characterize the factors that are associated with AIDS-defining illnesses (ADIs) amongst people living with HIV (PLHIV) who are poorly adherent or retained in care in order to identify those at highest risk of poor clinical outcomes. We recruited 99 adult PLHIV with a history of poor adherence to ART, poor clinic attendance, or unsuppressed viral load (VL) from the Infectious Disease Program (IDP) of the Grady Health System in Atlanta, Georgia between January and May 2011 to participate in a survey investigating the acceptability of a financial incentive for improving adherence. Clinical outcomes including the number of ADI episodes in the last five years, VLs, and CD4 counts were abstracted from medical records. Associations between survey items and number of ADIs were performed using chi-square analysis. In our study, 36.4% of participants had ≥1 ADI in the last five years. The most common ADIs were Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, recurrent bacterial pneumonia, and esophageal candidiasis.

Only 24% of HIV-infected patients had private insurance. Seventy-two percent of patients with fewer than 200 CD4+ T cells either had no insurance or relied on public assistance for health care. Thus, although 50% of asymptomatic individuals identified by routine voluntary HIV screening in an inner-city sexually transmitted disease clinic may benefit from therapy for their disease, 75% of those qualifying for presently recommended therapy either depend on publicly funded health care or have no means of payment for care."
3643,0.005,1.0000,"In a retrospective study of 648 persons with HIV infection in Cambodia, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to start antiretroviral treatment based on clinical criteria alone or based on a combination of clinical symptoms and the total lymphocyte count. As a reference test, we used the 2003 WHO criteria, including the CD4 count. The 2003 WHO clinical criteria had a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 57%, and an accuracy of 89% to identify patients who need highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In our clinic, with a predominance of patients with advanced disease, the 2003 WHO clinical criteria alone was a good predictor of those needing HAART. A total lymphocyte count as an extra criterion did not improve the accuracy. Nine percent of patients were wrongly identified to be in need of HAART. Among them, almost 50% had a CD4 count of more than 500 cells/muL, and 73% had weight loss of more than 10% as a stage-defining condition. Our data suggest that, in settings with limited access to CD4 count testing, it might be useful to target this test to patients in WHO stage 3 whose staging is based on weight loss alone, to avoid unnecessary treatment."
3847,0.005,1.0000,"A Retroviral Coinfection Clinic was established in 1991 at Charity Hospital Medical Center of Louisiana to study patients dually infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I, HTLV-II). Eight patients were evaluated clinically, and by immunological and virological studies. Multiple neuromuscular diseases were observed, including tropical spastic paraparesis, polymyositis, and polyneuropathies. Only one patient developed AIDS. HIV-1 infected patients with HTLV-I, but not HTLV-II, coinfection have maintained stable CD4 counts, despite the fact that quantitative HIV DNA PCR suggests a relatively high copy number. HTLV-I/II antigens were detected in lymphocyte cultures from four patients, and lymphoblastoid cell lines have been established from two. These results support the contention that upregulated HTLV-I/II virus expression and disease manifestations occur during coinfection with HIV, sometimes in association with normal CD4 counts."

A genetic polymorphism on chromosome 19 (rs12979860) upstream of interferon-λ3 (IFNλ3) is associated with a twofold change in sustained virologic response rate after 48 weeks of treatment with pegylated interferon/ribavirin in HCV genotype 1 (GT1) treatment-naïve patients. We conducted epigenetic analysis on the IFNλ3 promoter to investigate whether DNA methylation is associated with response to HCV therapy. DNA samples from HCV GT1-infected subjects receiving an interferon-free paritaprevir-containing combination regimen (N=540) and from HCV-uninfected, healthy controls (N=124) were analysed for IFNλ3 methylation levels. Methylation was strongly associated with rs12979860 allele status whether adjusting for HCV status (r=65.0%, 95% CI: [60.2%, 69.5%]), or not (r=64.4%), both with P<2.2×10"

An analysis of Ottawa Hospital Viral Hepatitis Clinic (Ottawa, Canada) patients between January 2000 and August 2013 was performed. HCV infection risk factors and HCV treatment outcomes were assessed. Socioeconomic status markers were based on area-level indicators linked to postal codes using administrative databases. Results. 55 (2.8%) Aboriginal and 1923 (97.2%) non-Aboriginal patients were evaluated. Aboriginals were younger (45.6 versus 49.6 years, p < 0.01). The distribution of gender (63.6% versus 68.3% male), HIV coinfection (9.1% versus 8.1%), advanced fibrosis stage (29.2% versus 28.0%), and SVR (56.3% versus 58.9%) was similar between groups. Aboriginals had a higher number of HCV risk factors, (mean 4.2 versus 3.1, p < 0.001) with an odds ratio of 2.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.4-4.4) for having 4+ risk factors. This was not explained after adjustment for income, social deprivation, and poor housing. Aboriginal status was not related to SVR. Aboriginals interrupted therapy more often due to loss to follow-up, poor adherence, and substance abuse (25.0% versus 4.6%). Conclusion. Aboriginal Canadians have higher levels of HCV risk factors, even when adjusting for socioeconomic markers. Despite facing greater barriers to care, SVR rates were comparable with non-Aboriginals. "
3415,0.005,1.0000,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the best choice for curative treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases not suitable for surgical intervention, but efforts should be made to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence. We aimed to investigate the association between nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the risk of HCC recurrence post-RFA. Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2012, we screened 48,807 patients with newly diagnosed HBV-related HCC. We identified 850 patients (200 patients who used NAs for more than 90 days and 650 who never used NA post-RFA) who received RFA as a potentially curative treatment for HCC. Patients in the NA-treated cohort were randomly matched 1:2 with patients in the untreated cohort by age, sex, cirrhosis, and the time period between RFA and initiation of NA therapy. Finally, 133 patients were recruited in the NA-treated group and 266 in the untreated group for analysis. Cumulative incidences of and hazard ratios (HRs) for HCC recurrence were analyzed after adjusting for competing mortality. The HCC recurrence rate of the NA-treated group was significantly lower than that of the untreated group (2-year recurrence rate: 41.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 32.9-50.6 vs. 54.3%; 95% CI: 48.0-60.6; modified log-rank test: P < 0.05). In modified Cox's regression analysis, NA therapy was independently associated with a decreased risk of HCC recurrence (HR, 0.69; 95% CI: 0.50-0.95; P < 0.05). Multivariate stratified analyses verified the association of NA therapy and decreased HCC recurrence in almost all patient subgroups."

Variables associated with initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) were analysed. Primary endpoint was time to failure after at least 6 months of ART and was defined as: VF, first of two consecutive virus loads (VL) >200 copies/mL; treatment discontinuation (TD) for any reason; and treatment failure as confirmed VL >200 copies/mL or TD. A Poisson multivariable analysis was performed to control for confounders. Migrants presented significantly lower CD4 counts and more frequent AIDS events at baseline. When adjusting for baseline confounders, migrants presented a lower likelihood to begin ART (odds ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.95, p 0.012). After initiating ART, the incidence VF rate was 6.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI 4.8-8.5) in migrants and 2.7 in natives (95% CI 2.2-3.3). Multivariable analysis confirmed that migrants had a higher risk of VF (incidence rate ratio 1.90, 95% CI 1.25-2.91, p 0.003) and treatment failure (incidence rate ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33, p 0.031), with no differences for TD. Among migrants, variables associated with VF were age, unemployment and use of a boosted protease inhibitor-based regimen versus nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Despite the use of more potent and safer drugs in the last 10 years, and even in a universal health care setting, migrants living with HIV still present barriers to initiating ART and an increased risk of VF compared to natives."
4932,0.005,1.0000,"The objective was to determine the current use of their general practitioner (GP) by patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and whether such patients would be interested in having 'shared care' between a specialist HIV clinic and their GP. A questionnaire was administered to 203 HIV-positive men attending the HIV outpatient clinic of a central London teaching hospital. The main outcome measures were patient characteristics, numbers of patients registered with a GP, numbers of patients with a GP aware of their diagnosis, contacts with the GP in the last year and level of interest and shared care. Eighty-five per cent of patients were registered with a GP of whom 67% knew of the diagnosis. Those diagnosed for more than 2 years were significantly more likely to have an informed GP. A total of 73% of those registered had visited their GP in the previous year although only 27% had visited for an HIV-related problem. Only 19% had a GP actively involved in their HIV care. In all 51% of the patients indicated an interest in having shared care between the clinic and their GP. A high proportion of HIV patients are registered with and attend a GP although they rarely consult for HIV-related problems. A significant proportion of patients expressed interest in having shared care suggesting that there is the potential for increased GP involvement in the care of patients with HIV infection."
2010,0.005,1.0000,"BACKGROUND In November and December 2012, 6 patients at a hemodialysis clinic were given a diagnosis of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. OBJECTIVE To investigate the outbreak to identify risk factors for transmission. METHODS A case patient was defined as a patient who was HCV-antibody negative on clinic admission but subsequently was found to be HCV-antibody positive from January 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013. Patient charts were reviewed to identify and describe case patients. The hypervariable region 1 of HCV from infected patients was tested to assess viral genetic relatedness. Infection control practices were evaluated via observations. A forensic chemiluminescent agent was used to identify blood contamination on environmental surfaces after cleaning. RESULTS Eighteen case patients were identified at the clinic from January 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013, resulting in an estimated 16.7% attack rate. Analysis of HCV quasispecies identified 4 separate clusters of transmission involving 11 case patients. The case patients and previously infected patients in each cluster were treated in neighboring dialysis stations during the same shift, or at the same dialysis station on 2 consecutive shifts. Lapses in infection control were identified. Visible and invisible blood was identified on multiple surfaces at the clinic. CONCLUSIONS Epidemiologic and laboratory data confirmed transmission of HCV among numerous patients at the dialysis clinic over 6 years. Infection control breaches were likely responsible. This outbreak highlights the importance of rigorous adherence to recommended infection control practices in dialysis settings."
1246,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection rate was examined in a selected cohort of healthy clients of an inner-city alcohol treatment center from 1990 through 1993. These subjects were also participating in a research protocol (n = 258) designed to assess immunity and HIV risk behaviors in inner city alcohol-dependent persons. Healthy alcohol-abusing heterosexual clients (165) had HIV testing conducted in an inner-city ambulatory alcohol treatment center between September 1990 and December 1993. Respondents were 93.9% African-American and 3.6% Hispanic; 72.1% were male. Anonymous HIV-1 antibody testing was conducted retrospectively for an additional 80 subjects who participated in the research protocol during the same interval, but for whom HIV-1 antibody testing was not conducted clinically at the time. HIV infection rate among the clinic-tested subjects (n = 165) was 4.4% for individuals who were exclusively alcohol-dependent, 1.4% for non-injecting drug use (IDU) mixed substance abusers, and 46.8% for clients with a history of IDU. Rates did not differ among cohorts tested in different years. Among non-injecting drug users tested in the clinic, all infected respondents (n = 3) were women (p = 0.03). Among those tested anonymously (n = 80), however, infection rate for exclusively alcohol-dependent persons was 16.7%, non-IDU mixed abusers 11.1%, and injecting drug users 48.3%, with seropositive males as well as females in each group. HIV infection rates for the pooled samples (n = 245) were 8.7% for exclusively alcohol-dependent persons, 5.1% for mixed abusers, and 54.5% for injecting drug users. Among non-injecting drug users, exclusively alcohol-dependent women had a significantly higher (p < 0.01) infection rate (20.0%) than the remaining females and males. Infection rates among exclusively alcohol-dependent males, male and female polysubstance non-IDU abusers, and injecting drug users were comparable with that seen in an earlier screening in the same clinic in 1989, with apparently little diffusion of infection from the IDU population to other substance abusers. An exception seemed to be exclusively alcohol-dependent females, who show substantially elevated rates. Age, housing, and other social differences may help segregated substance-abusing populations in the relatively small Newark metropolitan area, although not protecting exclusively alcohol-dependent females."
648,0.005,1.0000,"Combinations of two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus a third agent represent the current standard for antiretroviral therapy. Stavudine is a nucleoside analogue that demonstrates in vitro activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 within an acceptable therapeutic index in a range of T lymphocyte and haematopoietic precursor cell lines. It is additive or synergistic in vitro with a number of other antiretrovirals including protease inhibitors in two and three way combinations and is active against zidovudine-resistant virus. It exhibits excellent oral bioavailability, with CSF penetration. In clinical use, stavudine exhibits antiretroviral activity as a monotherapy similar to zidovudine, and is of proven clinical benefit in zidovudine-pretreated patients. In combination with didanosine and/or nelfinavir it results in more substantial and durable responses in immunological and virological markers than reported with either drug alone. Comparative trials in zidovudine-experienced patients suggest a similar frequency of adverse events to that observed with zidovudine. Peripheral neuropathy is the most common dose-limiting toxicity with haematological and hepatic function disturbance being infrequent. Reasons for stavudine failure are not established, with no consistent genotypic pattern being associated with changes in stavudine sensitivity in vitro or in vivo. The role of stavudine is as a component of triple therapy regimens both in initial therapy and in patients with prior zidovudine experience."
9409,0.005,1.0000,"Ribavirin was administered orally in escalating doses for 2 or 4 weeks to 15 symptom-free, human immunodeficiency virus seropositive homosexual men with generalized lymphadenopathy. Reverse transcriptase activity was inhibited during therapy when steady-state plasma concentrations were greater than 6 mumol/L. These concentrations were achieved with 1200 or 2400 mg/day for 2 weeks or a loading dose of 2400 mg/day for 3 days followed by 600 mg/day for 4 weeks. Drug accumulation occurred at all doses. The elimination half-life appeared to be approximately 2 weeks. Reversible adverse reactions, principally resulting in central nervous system symptoms and anemia, correlated with dose and duration of therapy. Immunologic enhancement of T-lymphocyte-mediated mitogen-induced responses was observed in the majority of patients who had reduction in reverse transcriptase activity. However, specific T4+ lymphocyte-mediated antigen-induced responses increased to within the normal range in only three patients. Significant enhancement appeared to correlate with the severity of baseline antigen-induced functional impairment. These data indicate that oral ribavirin can be given for at least 1 month with acceptable toxicity at doses that appear to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus replication."

Subcutaneous IL-2 was prescribed thrice weekly (at a dose of 3 x 10(6) IU) for 24 weeks and the patients were followed-up for 32 weeks. IL-2 treatment induced an increase in the CD4+ percentage (P<0.001) and CD4+ cell count (P<0.009). Furthermore. natural killer (NK) cell activity was increased (P<0.001) at week 8 of treatment, whereas lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity showed a transient, nonsignificant increase at week 8 and was reduced (P<0.001) at 32 weeks. However, the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity decreased against HIV antigens, and the proliferative response to Candida, IL-2 and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) declined during the first 8 weeks (P<0.05) and returned to baseline levels after 32 weeks.

7674,0.005,1.0000,"Combined antiretroviral therapies (cART) have had remarkable success in reducing morbidity and mortality among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, mild forms of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), characterized by loss of synapses, remain. cART may maintain an undetectable HIV RNA load but does not eliminate the expression of viral proteins such as trans-activator of transcription (Tat) and the envelope glycoprotein gp120 in the brain. These two viral proteins are known to promote synaptic simplifications by several mechanisms, including alteration of mitochondrial function and dynamics. In this review, we aim to outline the many targets and pathways used by viral proteins to alter mitochondria dynamics, which contribute to HIV-induced neurotoxicity. A better understanding of these pathways is crucial for the development of adjunct therapies for HAND."
1237,0.005,1.0000,"African green monkeys (AGMs) are naturally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) at high prevalence levels and do not progress to AIDS. Sexual transmission is the main transmission route in AGM, while mother-to-infant transmission (MTIT) is negligible. We investigated SIV transmission in wild AGMs to assess whether or not high SIV prevalence is due to differences in mucosal permissivity to SIV (i.e., whether the genetic bottleneck of viral transmission reported in humans and macaques is also observed in AGMs in the wild). We tested 121 sabaeus AGMs (Chlorocebus sabaeus) from the Gambia and found that 53 were SIV infected (44%). By combining serology and viral load quantitation, we identified 4 acutely infected AGMs, in which we assessed the diversity of the quasispecies by single-genome amplification (SGA) and documented that a single virus variant established the infections. We thus show that natural SIV transmission in the wild is associated with a genetic bottleneck similar to that described for mucosal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission in humans. Flow cytometry assessment of the immune cell populations did not identify major differences between infected and uninfected AGM. The expression of the SIV coreceptor CCR5 on CD4+ T cells dramatically increased in adults, being higher in infected than in uninfected infant and juvenile AGMs. Thus, the limited SIV MTIT in natural hosts appears to be due to low target cell availability in newborns and infants, which supports HIV MTIT prevention strategies aimed at limiting the target cells at mucosal sites. Combined, (i) the extremely high prevalence in sexually active AGMs, (ii) the very efficient SIV transmission in the wild, and (iii) the existence of a fraction of multiparous females that remain uninfected in spite of massive exposure to SIV identify wild AGMs as an acceptable model of exposed, uninfected individuals."
2567,0.005,1.0000,"In an attempt to understand the structural reasons for differences in specificity and activity of proteinases from two retroviruses encoded by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and myeloblastosis associated virus (MAV), we mutated five key residues predicted to form part of the enzyme subsites S1, S2 and S3 in the substrate binding cleft of the wild-type MAV proteinase wMAV PR. These were changed to the residues occupying a similar or identical position in the HIV-1 enzyme. The resultant mutated MAV proteinase (mMAV PR) exhibits increased enzymatic activity, altered substrate specificity, a substantially changed pH activity profile and a higher pH stability close to that observed in the HIV-1 PR. This dramatic alteration of MAV PR activity achieved by site-directed mutagenesis suggests that we have identified the amino acid residues contributing substantially to the differences between MAV and HIV-1 proteinases."

With worse outcomes on the waitlist, HIV-infected patients may actually be disproportionately affected by the organ shortage in the United States. One potential solution is the use of HIV-infected deceased donors (HIVDD), recently legalized by the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act. This is the first analysis of patient-specific data from potential HIVDD, retrospectively examining charts of HIV-infected patients dying in care at six HIV clinics in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2014. Our data suggest that there are four to five potential HIVDD dying in Philadelphia annually who might yield two to three kidneys and three to five livers for transplant. Extrapolated nationally, this would approximate 356 potential HIVDD yielding 192 kidneys and 247 livers annually. However, several donor risk indices raise concerns about the quality of kidneys that could be recovered from HIVDD as a result of older donor age and comorbidities. On the other hand, livers from these potential HIVDD are of similar quality to HIV-negative donors dying locally, although there is a high prevalence of positive hepatitis C antibody. "

Initial evaluation of these parameters was conducted in the western countries where accessible ARVs, circulating HIV subtypes and mode of transmission are different from the situation in Nigeria. This study appraised these parameters, and efficacy of generic ARVs. Consenting 106 HIV infected ARV naïve patients were enrolled. CD4 T lymphocyte and plasma HIV RNA levels were determined at interval for 24 months. Ninety eight (92.5%) of the patients who completed the follow up in strict adherence to therapy guideline were included in the analysis. Baseline median CD4 T lymphocyte increased from 114 (Range: 6-330) to highest 357 (Range: 15-1036) cells/ μ L at 18 months of therapy, while baseline median plasma viral RNA declined from 4.6 (Range: 2.6-6.0) Log10 copies/mL to undetectable level within three months of therapy. Significant CD4 T-cell restoration and plasma viral RNA decline in the study population demonstrate efficacy of the generic HAART. The importance of combined use of both parameters for evaluation of immunologic and virologic responses to ART was confirmed. "

To develop a polymerase chain reaction-based assay capable of detecting members of all major phylogenetic SIVcpz and HIV-1 lineages (groups M, N, and O), primer pairs in conserved pol and env regions were designed. Both primer sets amplified </=10 copies of selected group M reference clones (subtypes A-H), proviral DNA or RNA of group N (YBF30), and group O of HIV-1 and also amplified divergent SIVcpz from cultured isolates (SIVcpzGAB1 and SIVcpzANT), uncultured spleen tissue (SIVcpzUS), and plasma (SIVcpzANT and SIVcpzUS). Sequences of the 2 amplicons (445 bp for gp41 and 261 bp for integrase) are of sufficient length for phylogenetic analyses, allowing both group and subtype classifications of the human viruses.

Fourteen participants were interviewed on two occasions. Two focus groups discussions were also conducted. Patients experienced important personal benefits as a result of HAART and the resulting clinical improvement. These benefits included a restoration of hope, self-esteem and personal agency. Patients were also relieved of the great fear which they had about the conditions of their death. The financial and social struggles introduced by AIDS illness continued after the introduction of HAART. The conclusion is that the HAART programs should provide more holistic care to patients to address the persistent family issues identified in this study. "

The entry into vigour of the Royal Decree-Law 12/2012 of 20 April has significantly restricted this right, so that unauthorized or non-resident foreigners may now only receive emergency care, if they are under 18 or pregnant women. Out of an estimated 459,909 illegal immigrants in our country, 2,700 to 4,600 are probably infected with HIV; 1,800 to 3,220 know that they are infected, and 80% of the latter could receive antiretroviral treatment. The Royal Decree-Law is likely to cause many undesirable consequences in this population infected with HIV: increasing mortality, promoting the emergence of opportunistic diseases, increasing hospital admissions, increasing infections in the population (by HIV and other pathogens), or contributing to mother to child transmission of HIV. The expected increase in morbidity and mortality will be a greater cost in patient care, a cost which will be significantly higher in the more immunosuppressed patients. Therefore, the enforcement of the Royal Decree-Law will be much less cost-effective in the short term than was expected, and will negatively affect our country's public health, especially for those patients infected with HIV who will not be covered, thus increasing healthcare medium to long term costs, and moving away from the international health goals that were established."

Greece belongs to the intermediate endemicity countries with a trend of decreasing prevalence of HBV infection during the last decade. However, the recent massive immigration to our country may have led to alterations of HBV epidemiology. In this study, we evaluated the epidemiological features of HBV infection in a sample of 3480 patients followed up during the years 1997-2006. Immigrants mainly from Albania represented the 18.6% of the total study population and 56.6% of children. The majority of the patients had no family history of HBV infection (67.3%) or of acute hepatitis (95.4%), no known source of infection (64.6%), with intrafamilial spread accounting for 16.9% of the HBV transmission in adults and 33.9% in children. HBeAg(-) hepatitis B was the predominant form of hepatitis (92.1%) among the Greek patients in contrast to the immigrants where 16.6% were HBeAg(+). Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed in 8.8% of the total population and 0.9% had hepatocellular carcinoma. A high proportion of children were HBeAg(+) (62%), 55% from immigrant families, 25.2% were infected in the perinatal period and had no evidence of disease complications. In conclusion our results showed (a) a changing pattern in the epidemiology of HBV infection in Greece due to the significant number of HBeAg(+) patients, especially among children and (b) a considerable number of patients although aware of their infection, present with advanced disease."

The presence of these mutations is an emerging problem compromising non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors-based therapies. Furthermore, factors associated with selection of these mutations are still not well defined. The current study aimed to evaluate the frequency and to characterize factors associated with the occurrence of multi-nucleos(t)ide resistance mutations among HIV-1 infected patients failing recommended first-line antiretroviral regimens in Cambodia."
4394,0.005,1.0000,"Serological detection of isolated anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) can occur in various scenarios, but the most clinically relevant situation is occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical relevance of isolated anti-HBc and of OBI with isolated anti-HBc from an unselected hospital population. A total of 14,253 patients referred for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)/anti-HBs testing were classified into either the Health Promotion Center (HPC) group or the patient group. For patients who were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, an anti-HBc test was additionally performed. An HBV DNA real-time PCR test was performed on isolated anti-HBc patients, and their demographic and clinical data were reviewed. The measured prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and OBI in isolated anti-HBc patients was 5.9 % and 4.7 %, respectively. Prevalence was higher in males, elderly people, and the patient group than in females, the younger, and the HPC group, respectively. In most cases, the levels of HBV DNA load were very low (less than 200 IU/mL), and most cases of OBI presented without liver disease or history of HBV infection. The prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and OBI are affected by the methods of detection, subject population, and constituent factors such as sex and age. Although detection of HBV DNA does not always indicate infectivity, highly sensitive standardized HBV DNA tests are needed in clinical settings to exclude the possibility of OBI, especially in the advanced age group."
6790,0.005,1.0000,"There is little information on infections caused by larval cestodes in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in developed countries. Two infections by larval cestodes were found in 714 HIV-infected patients studied from 1998 to 2004 at the Hospital General Universitario de Elche in Spain (Mediterranean Coast). The first patient was a Colombian immigrant diagnosed as having neurocysticercosis, and subsequently found to have HIV infection. The second case was an HIV-infected Spanish patient who developed hydatid disease of the liver, lung and peritoneum. Both patients died. Although infrequent, infections by larval cestodes constitute a cause of disease in HIV-infected patients in developed countries, and might be linked with a more severe presentation."
5815,0.005,1.0000,"Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is a recently discovered hepatitis B virus (HBV) receptor. In the present study, we used TK-NOG mice with a humanized liver to examine the impact of endogenous NTCP expression on HBV infection. Upon inoculation with HBV, these mice exhibited clear viremia in 2 weeks, and serum HBV DNA levels gradually increased. The frequency of HBsAg-positive hepatocytes in the liver was 5.1 ± 0.6% at 2 weeks and increased with increasing HBV DNA levels, reaching 92.9 ± 2.8% at 10 to 12 weeks. In vivo siRNA-mediated NTCP knockdown before and after HBV inoculation significantly suppressed the levels of HBV replication and the frequency of HBsAg-positive hepatocytes at 2 weeks, whereas NTCP knockdown 13 weeks after infection did not affect these parameters. Similar to the humanized mouse livers in the early phase of HBV infection, human liver samples from chronic hepatitis B patients, especially those treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues, contained a considerable number of hepatocytes that were negative for the anti-HBs antibody. In conclusion, NTCP inhibition prevents the spread of HBV-infected hepatocytes in mice with a humanized liver. NTCP-targeted therapy has potential for regulating HBV infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B."

8668,0.005,1.0000,"To compare the seroprevalence of and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) among patients attending a public sexually transmitted disease clinic, the authors conducted both voluntary and blinded seroprevalence surveys between June 1989 and August 1990. For the voluntary survey, every twenty-fifth patient attending the clinic for a new problem was invited to receive anonymous testing for HIV antibody. For the blinded survey, sera obtained for syphilis serologies from 2,297 (86%) of the 2,682 patients attending the clinic for a new problem were tested for HIV antibody after all personal identifiers were removed. Of the 946 eligible patients, 631 (66.7%) agreed to participate in the voluntary survey. Black men were significantly less likely to participate than other men and women (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of HIV antibody was 25% greater in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey (15.2% and 11.4%, respectively, p < 0.05). This difference was due primarily to black homosexual/bisexual men, who had a 12.7-fold greater risk of HIV infection in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey. These results suggest that blinded seroprevalence surveys may provide a better prevalence estimate of HIV infection than voluntary surveys. The greater risk for HIV infection observed among homosexual and bisexual black men, who were tested only in the blinded serosurvey, suggests that efforts to increase voluntary testing for HIV infection in this group should be developed."
4010,0.005,1.0000,"Neurologic complications associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection vary geographically. To understand the pattern of HIV-associated neurologic complications in Mexico, 120 AIDS patients from Mexico City, Mexico, and 500 AIDS patients from Houston, Texas, were studied cross-sectionally and retrospectively. Neurologic, laboratory, imaging, and pathologic examinations identified 40 Mexican patients and 130 U.S. patients with neurologic complications. Whereas AIDS dementia complex was the most common neurologic manifestation in both groups, intracranial tuberculoma was present only in the Mexican population (10%). Primary brain lymphoma was more prevalent in the U.S. population (8.4%). The different findings in the Mexican population likely reflect afflictions common to developing countries--a high prevalence of tuberculosis and a high mortality rate. These conditions preclude complications such as lymphoma, which develop later in the natural course of HIV infection."
3526,0.005,1.0000,"In Brazil, current trends of the AIDS epidemic include an increase in transmission through heterosexual contact, predominantly from men to women, with more cases of AIDS in women and more children contaminated by vertical transmission. There is also a high proportion of cases in poor people or people living in small towns. HIV-infected patients with high levels of immunodeficiency are frequently hospitalized after their first visit to the clinic due to opportunistic infections, characteristic of advanced disease. This study characterized the clinical and laboratory pattern of AIDS in a sample of patients attended for the first time in the AIDS clinic of the Federal University of Bahia Hospital (HUPES) in Salvador, Brazil. We revised medical charts of cases of subjects registered at the outpatient AIDS clinic from January 1997 to December 2003. The demographics, clinical data, and laboratory characteristics were analyzed to determine the degree of immunodeficiency at the time of admission. A total of 377 patients were evaluated (58.6% were male, with a mean sample age of 33.4 years). The most frequent clinical manifestations were asthenia, weight loss, fever, anemia, dermatitis, oral thrush and diarrhea. CDC criteria were not adequate to define the initial cases. After admission to the outpatient clinic, nearly 25% of the patients were hospitalized immediately, indicating delay in the diagnosis. In Bahia, the initial presentation of HIV-infected patients to health care assistance is occurring at a late stage of the disease, when signs and symptoms of immunodeficiency are already established. Efforts are necessary to construct strategies to make an early diagnosis of these patients, improve the quality of care, and guarantee the benefits of antiretroviral therapy, when it is indicated."

Modified directly observed therapy (mDOT) with weekly administration of pegylated interferon might improve adherence and outcomes for patients infected with chronic HCV. The purpose of this study was to compare two treatment protocols and examine predictors of sustained virologic response (SVR). This retrospective review compares HCV treatment outcomes in two outpatient clinics at an urban academic medical center. Gastroenterology fellows provided standard treatment (SC) in one clinic; a nurse practitioner administered weekly pegylated interferon injections weekly in a primary care clinic. All patients received oral ribavirin. Data was extracted from the medical records of all treated patients over a 5-year period. 155 treatment-naïve, chronically infected HCV patients were treated. Ninety-seven patients received mDOT treatment and 58 received standard care. Mean age was 46 years. Genotype 1 represented 59 % of the sample. The mDOT patients were significantly more likely to be younger (44 vs. 50 years), have a history of injection drug use (93.1 vs. 50.0 %), and be HIV-infected (13.5 vs. 2 %) compared to SC patients. The overall SVR rate was 45.2 % and did not differ between the groups in unadjusted analyses (p = 0.95). Genotype was the only predictor of SVR. Patients treated by nurse practitioners trained in HCV care and seen weekly for interferon injections have comparable treatment outcomes to patients treated by specialists. "

Information is lacking regarding the prevalence of cigarette smoking among people living with HIV or about their intentions to quit smoking. A survey was conducted with a sample of patients attending an HIV outpatient clinic at San Francisco General Hospital to assess the prevalence of cigarette smoking and the level of interest in quitting. In total, 228 assessments were completed. Study results revealed a high percentage of smokers among our sample of individuals living with HIV compared to the percentage of smokers found in the general adult population. A total of 123 individuals (54%) reported that they smoked cigarettes. Men were more than twice as likely to have made previous attempts at smoking cessation than were woman. The majority of cigarette smokers (63%) reported that they were currently thinking about quitting. Respondents' preferences for types of smoking cessation methods are discussed, and recommendations are proposed for identifying and treating tobacco dependence in this population."

Several structural investigations have already been reported to reveal the molecular mechanism of the drug resistance. As full length crystal structure for HIV-1 integrase is still unsolved, we herein use the crystal structure of the full length prototype foamy virus (PFV) in complex with virus DNA and inhibitor Elvitegravir as a template to construct the wild type and E92Q/N155H mutant system of HIV-1 integrase. Molecular dynamic simulations was used to revel the binding mode and the drug resistance of the EVG ligand in E92Q/N155H. Several important interactions were discovered between the mutated residues and the residues in the active site of the E92Q/N155H double mutant pattern, and cross correlation and clustering methods were used for detailed analysis. The results from the MD simulation studies will be used to guide the experimental efforts of developing novel inhibitors against drug-resistant HIV integrase mutants. "
7421,0.005,1.0000,"The central nervous system (CNS) is of particular importance in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. First, the CNS may be difficult to access for anti-retroviral treatment and may become a sanctuary for residual viruses. Second, HIV-1 infection may lead to AIDS dementia complex (ADC) culminating in HIV-1 encephalitis. In order to examine the pattern of drug resistance and the role of encephalitis in enhancing viral redistribution to the CNS, we compared pol gene quasispecies of the spleen and brain in two patients with and two patients without HIV-1 encephalitis, who had been treated with zidovudine (AZT). Although a variable degree of AZT resistance was noted in both the spleen and brain of all patients, phylogenetic analysis indicated that quasispecies developed rather independently in the systemic circulation (spleen) and CNS (brain) of patients without HIV-1 encephalitis, while similar pol gene sequences were obtained from the two compartments of patients with HIV-1 encephalitis. env gene V3 region of patients with HIV-1 encephalitis showed distinct quasispecies in the spleen and brain. Our results suggest that HIV-1 redistribution to CNS is more active in cases with encephalitis and that HIV-1 distributed late to CNS grow actively under certain selective pressure exerted on the V3 region of the env gene."
5072,0.005,1.0000,"The Epstein-Barr virus immediate-early gene product BZLF1 transactivates the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR). The BZLF1 gene product caused an 18-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity from an HIV-1 LTR lacZ expression vector, whereas the HIV-1 transactivator tat caused a 44-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity. When cells were transfected with both BZLF1 (pEBV-Z) and tat (pTAT3) expression vectors, as well as HIV-1 LTR lacZ plasmid (pLRON), a 214-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity was observed. This result suggests a synergistic effect of BZLF1 and tat on HIV-1 LTR-directed lacZ gene expression. Analysis of quantitative BZLF1 and tat requirements for maximal HIV-1 LTR activation indicates that BZLF1 does not reduce the amount of tat required for maximal LTR activation, as would be expected if the BZLF1 synergistic effect was due to increased tat gene expression. Thus, coordinate effects of BZLF1 and tat on the HIV-1 LTR or its transcript are probably responsible for synergistic HIV-1 LTR activation."
9783,0.005,1.0000,"The recent identification of the CC-CKR5 beta chemokine receptor as a major cofactor for entry of macrophage-tropic isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) raises the question of whether macrophage tropism is determined by utilization of this chemokine receptor. We observe that in addition to macrophage-tropic isolates of clades A, B, and E, macrophage-tropic isolates of clade F also utilize the CC-CKR5 molecule for entry. However, using single-round replication-competent reporter viruses carrying the envelope genes of T-cell line-tropic or macrophage-tropic phenotypic recombinant and mutant HIV-1 strains in infection of stable cell lines that coexpress the CD4 and chemokine receptors, we were unable to establish a strict correlation between macrophage tropism and utilization of the CC-CKR5 chemokine receptor. This latter finding suggests that a cofactor other than CC-CKR5 serves to determine entry into primary macrophages."
3667,0.005,1.0000,"We reported recently that exposure of human T cells to soluble HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 induced biologically active tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-related cytokine receptor of activated NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL), the primary drive to osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Furthermore, certain anti-HIV protease inhibitors linked clinically to accelerated bone loss in HIV disease blocked the physiological control of RANKL activity by interferon (IFN)-gamma through inhibition of degradation of the RANKL nuclear adapter signalling protein, TNF receptor associated protein 6 (TRAF6). We now report a series of reciprocal interactions among HIV-1, RANKL and IFN-gamma. RANKL augmented HIV replication in acutely and chronically infected cells of T lymphocyte and monocyte lineage, effects which occurred at a transcriptional level in conjunction with activation of NF-kappaB. TNF-alpha and RANKL were markedly synergistic in induction of HIV. Low pharmacological levels of IFN-gamma (0.75-3 ng/ml) suppressed RANKL-driven enhancement of HIV replication, as did L-T6DP-1, a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of TRAF6. In contrast, HIV replication induced by TNF-alpha and phorbol ester were not inhibited, and in some cases augmented, by IFN-gamma. We conclude that a positive feedback loop exists between RANKL production and HIV replication, which may be relevant to both the pathophysiology of HIV-linked osteopenia and control of HIV growth. This pathway appears distinct from those of other cytokine activators of HIV, with respect to its utilization of TRAF6 and its suppression by IFN-gamma. These data raise the possibility that TRAF-specific inhibitory peptides, alone or in conjunction with IFN-gamma, could be used to regulate HIV activation in vivo."
4508,0.005,1.0000,"Viral persistence is associated with hierarchical antiviral CD8 T cell exhaustion with increased programmed death-1 (PD-1) expression. In HCV persistence, HCV-specific CD8 T cells from the liver (the site of viral replication) display increased PD-1 expression and a profound functional impairment that is not reversed by PD-1 blockade alone. Here, we report that the inhibitory receptor cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is preferentially upregulated in PD-1(+) T cells from the liver but not blood of chronically HCV-infected patients. PD-1/CTLA-4 co-expression in intrahepatic T cells was associated with a profound HCV-specific effector dysfunction that was synergistically reversed by combined PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade in vitro, but not by blocking PD-1 or CTLA-4 alone. A similar effect was observed in circulating HCV-specific CD8 T cells with increased PD-1/CTLA-4 co-expression during acute hepatitis C. The functional response to combined blockade was directly associated with CTLA-4 expression, lost with CD28-depletion and CD4-independent (including CD4(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs). We conclude that PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways both contribute to virus-specific T cell exhaustion at the site of viral replication by a redundant mechanism that requires combined PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade to reverse. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of virus-specific T cell dysfunction, and suggest that the synergistic effect by combined inhibitory receptor blockade might have a therapeutic application against chronic viral infection in vivo, provided that it does not induce autoimmunity."

Nevertheless statins up-regulate low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, required for HCV cell entry, and the closely related scavenger receptors SRBI and CD36; moreover they reduce class II major histocompatibility complex expression on antigen presenting cell, modulating T-cell activation. In vivo LDL levels have been identified as prognostic indicator of sustained viral response to IFN in patients with HCV infection, suggesting that lipid-lowering agents might conversely favour HCV entry into the hepatocytes and translate into higher viral replication. We evaluated the effect of fluvastatin on HCV-RNA levels, CD36 expression and T-cell homeostasis in HCV-RNA positive patients. HCV-RNA was measured at baseline and after 4 weeks in 42 HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients, randomized to receive either fluvastatin 80 mg qd or no treatment. CD36 expression and markers of T-cell activation were evaluated by means of flow cytometry. Plasma interleukin (IL)-10, IFN-gamma and IL-7 were measured by ELISA. Serum cholesterol and LDL decreased significantly in the treatment group (P = 0.0001 and 0.01, respectively). Surprisingly a significant increase of HCV-RNA levels was seen after 4 weeks of fluvastatin (P = 0.03). The percentages of naive/activated/apoptotic cells and CD36 expression remained unchanged. Fluvastatin did not inhibit HCV-RNA replication in vivo; conversely we observed a significant increase of HCV-RNA levels. CD36 expression on monocytes were not up-regulated by statins as previously reported in vitro. The correlation between HCV infectivity, oxidized-LDL receptor and statins in HCV infection need further evaluation."
8661,0.005,1.0000,"Candida albicans has been shown to vary in its phenotypic expression with the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Isolates of C. albicans were obtained from 45 patients with HIV infection during the progression of their disease and differentiated using two methods. The first utilized the morphological characteristics of colonies, and the second method utilized a small portion of C. albicans DNA as a probe on Southern-transferred, EcoRI-digested C. albicans genomic DNA. In 67% of the patients a single strain of C. albicans, as determined by the DNA analysis, was isolated from each individual. The phenotypic expression of the genetically identical strains varied considerably over the experimental period with one morphotype being predominant. These results showed that the genotype of C. albicans persisted in the majority of HIV-infected individuals, but that the phenotypical expression of this strain changed. A novel finding in this study was that 18 strains of C. albicans had DNA which did not hybridize to the probe used."
7558,0.005,1.0000,"T cells depend on costimulation by accessory cells for an immune response. Costimulatory macrophage activity involves the expression of B7 molecules whose expression is upregulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and downregulated by interleukin-10 (IL-10). The expression of low-affinity Fc gamma IIIR (CD16), in contrast, is upregulated in the presence of IL-10 and downregulated in the presence of IFN-gamma. In human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, the balance between IFN-gamma and IL-10 expression shifts toward IL-10 predominance. Herein, we compare B7 and CD16 macrophage phenotypes from healthy and from HIV-1-infected patients. Patient macrophages express B7 molecules in lower density than macrophages from healthy donors and are resistant to the upregulation of costimulatory molecule expression. B7 expression can be normalized in patient macrophages by treating them with anti IL-10 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and IFN-gamma together but not by treatment with either anti-IL-10 mAb or IFN-gamma alone. This finding suggests an excess of IL-10 in HIV-1 infection and an IFN-gamma deficiency, consistent with previous cytokine assessments in HIV-1-infected subjects. The upregulation of CD16 expression was readily induced in patient macrophages by treatment with IL-10 and was inhibited by treatment with IFN-gamma. CD16 expression identifies the subset of cytotoxic macrophages that has been shown to destroy CD4T cells, which they target through CD4-reactive immune-complexed HIV-1 envelope molecules."
9433,0.005,1.0000,"Entry of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus into most cells requires the presence of the CD4 protein in combination with one of several recently described co-receptors. CXCR-4 (fusin) was the first identified, and it serves as co-receptor for T-cell-line tropic (T-tropic) HIV-1 isolates. To determine the expression of CXCR-4 in the brain, a major target of HIV pathology, we used immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction with CXCR-4-specific antibodies and probes. We found that CXCR-4 was expressed in several cell types in brain, but notably in neurons and microglia, a finding that was replicated in tissue culture. The study of the expression of CXCR-4 in the brain, which may be one of many chemokine receptors in the central nervous system, may provide further insight into the interactions between brain cells, pathogens, and the immune system, and help understand the pathogenesis of HIV dementia."
7532,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects the central nervous system (CNS) and plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of AIDS dementia. However, mechanisms underlying HIV-1 gene expression in the CNS are poorly understood. The importance of CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP) for HIV-1 expression in cells of the immune system has been recently reported. In this study, we have examined the role and the molecular mechanisms by which proteins of the C/EBP family regulate HIV-1 gene transcription in human brain cells. We found that NF-IL6 acts as a potent activator of the long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven transcription in microglial and oligodendroglioma cells. In contrast, C/EBPgamma inhibits NF-IL6-induced activation. Consistent with previous data, our transient expression results show cell-type-specific NF-IL6-mediated transactivation. In glial cells, full activation needs the presence of the C/EBP binding sites; however, NF-IL6 is still able to function via the minimal -40/+80 region. In microglial cells, C/EBP sites are not essential, since NF-IL6 acts through the -68/+80 LTR region, containing two binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1. Moreover, we show that functional interactions between NF-IL6 and Sp1 lead to synergistic transcriptional activation of the LTR in oligodendroglioma and to mutual repression in microglial cells. We further demonstrate that NF-IL6 physically interacts with the nuclear receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), via its DNA binding domain, in vitro and in cells, which results in mutual transcriptional repression. These findings reveal how the interplay of NF-IL6 and C/EBPgamma, together with Sp1 and COUP-TF, regulates HIV-1 gene transcription in brain cells."

Multiple linear regression analysis identified two independent factors associated with higher HCV viral load, HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection and protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy. Antiretroviral therapy in general was independently associated with lower HCV viral load. This suggests that HCV viral load kinetics could differ according to the choice of HAART regimen."
8501,0.005,1.0000,"We assessed the relationship between atazanavir (ATV)-based antiretroviral treatment (ART) and plasma hepatitis C virus (HCV) viral load in a population of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who received ART based on a protease inhibitor (PI) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) were included. Patients were stratified by ART drug [ATV/rtv, lopinavir (LPV/rtv), efavirenz (EFV), nevirapine (NVP), and other PIs], HCV genotype (1/4 and 2/3), and IL28B genotype (CC and non-CC). The Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-squared test were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Multivariate analysis consisted of a stepwise linear regression analysis. Six hundred and forty-nine HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were included. HCV genotype 1/4 patients who received ATV had higher HCV RNA levels [6.57 (5.9-6.8) log IU/ml] than those who received LPV [6.1 (5.5-6.5) log IU/ml], EFV [6.1 (5.6-6.4) log IU/ml], NVP [5.8 (5.5-5.9) log IU/ml], or other PIs [6.1 (5.7-6.4) log IU/ml] (p=0.014). This association held for the IL28B genotype (CC versus non-CC). The association was not found in patients carrying HCV genotypes 2/3. The linear regression model identified the IL28B genotype and ATV use as independent factors associated with HCV RNA levels. ATV-based therapy may be associated with a higher HCV RNA viral load in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients."
9565,0.005,1.0000,"Neonatal rhesus macaque 95-3 was inoculated with nonpassaged simian-human immunodeficiency virus strain SHIV-vpu(+), which encodes env of the laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strain IIIB and is considered nonpathogenic. CD4(+) T-cell counts dropped to <200 cells/microl within 4.6 years, and monkey 95-3 died with opportunistic infections 5.9 years postinoculation. Transfer of blood from 95-3 to two naive adult macaques resulted in high peak viral loads and rapid, persistent T-cell depletion. Progeny virus evolved in 95-3 despite high SHIV-vpu(+) neutralizing antibody titers and still used CXCR4 but, in contrast to parental SHIV-vpu(+), productively infected macrophages and resisted neutralization. Sequence analysis revealed three new potential glycosylation sites in gp120; another two were lost. Strikingly similar mutations were detected in a laboratory worker who progressed to AIDS after accidental HIV-IIIB infection (T. Beaumont et al., J. Virol. 75:2246-2252, 2001), thus supporting the SHIV-vpu(+)/rhesus macaque system as a relevant model. Similar mutations were also described after rapid passage of chimeric viruses encoding IIIB env in rhesus and pig-tailed macaques (M. Cayabyab et al., J. Virol. 73:976-984, 1999; Z. Q. Liu et al., Virology 260:295-307, 1999; S. V. Narayan et al., Virology 256:54-63, 1999; R. Raghavan et al., Brain Pathol. 7:851-861, 1997; E. B. Stephens et al., Virology 231:313-321, 1997). Thus, HIV-IIIB env evolved similarly in three different species; this selection occurred in chronically infected individuals during disease progression as well as after rapid virus passage. We postulate that evolutionary pressure led to the outgrowth of more aggressive viral variants in all three species."

Three groups of patients were enrolled: group 1, asymptomatic patients (n = 30); group 2, AIDS symptomatic patients without body weight loss or diarrhea (n = 37); and group 3, AIDS symptomatic patients with severe body weight loss and/or diarrhea (n = 33). Clinical and biological data (covariates) were collected. A population approach was performed with three blood samples per patient to estimate the mean population pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance [CL]/oral bioavailability [F], V/F, k(a), and lag time) and the derived ones (k(el), C(max), T(max), and area under the curve [AUC]). The relationships between groups, exposure (i.e., estimated individual post hoc AUCs), and covariates were explored by using multiple linear regressions. A significant increase in median AUCs (165, 349, and 705 ng. h. ml(-1) for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively [P < 0.0001]) was observed. The enhancement in saquinavir exposure could be due to the destruction of the transporters in enterocytes and/or to the enlargement of their tight junctions, allowing a paracellular crossing of saquinavir as the illness spreads. Because of grapefruit juice intake by every patient, no implication of CYP3A4 could be assessed. These results strongly suggest that, despite its low intrinsic oral bioavailability, saquinavir can be considered as a relevant treatment for HIV-1-infected patients with diarrhea and/or wasting syndrome. This must be evaluated in a long-term period."
8830,0.005,1.0000,"In East Africa, bacteremia is more common in hospitalized human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-positive than -negative patients. In 1991, blood cultures and clinical and laboratory data were obtained from 319 patients in Ivory Coast, where both HIV-1 and -2 infections occur. Forty-three bacterial, 10 mycobacterial, and 8 fungal pathogens were isolated from blood of 54 patients (17%). Pathogens isolated significantly (P < or = .05) more frequently from HIV-positive than -negative patients were nonmycobacterial bacteria, particularly Salmonella enteritidis; mycobacteria, particularly Mycobacterium tuberculosis-Mycobacterium bovis; and yeast or fungus. HIV-1 or -2 positivity was associated with a 3-fold increased risk for septicemia (P < .02). HIV-positive patients with fever or with lymphocyte counts < 1000 were more likely to be septicemic than those without these characteristics. Mortality increased significantly with HIV positivity (40% vs. 14%, P < .001) and, among HIV-positive patients, with having pathogens isolated from blood (63% vs. 33%, P < .001)."
4539,0.005,1.0000,"Four cases of pleural cryptococcosis as the form of onset of cryptococcosis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are reported. In two out of the four cases cryptococci were simultaneously isolated in other localizations (blood and meninges). In the two remaining patients the pleura was the only site of the disease, with serum determination of the cryptococci antigen being negative in one. The four patients evolved favourably, with three being exclusively treated with fluconazol. Pleuritis is an infrequent manifestation in cryptococcosis although it may be the form of onset and the only localization of the disease. Only 10 cases have been reported in patients with HIV infection. The present four cases represent 11% of the authors' series of cryptococcosis in AIDS patients. The diagnostic possibility of cryptococcosis should be considered in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection presenting pleural effusion."
9347,0.005,1.0000,"Type and prevalence of zidovudine (ZDV) resistance mutations in HIV-1-infected children in clinically stable condition and on ZDV monotherapy were analyzed to evaluate the effect of switching to didanosine (ddI) monotherapy or to ZDV plus ddI on the pattern of mutations and on the clinical outcome. Monthly clinical and laboratory controls for HIV-1 infection status were performed; at enrollment and every 4 to 6 months after treatment randomization mutant proviral sequences were evaluated in all the children, whereas viral burden was performed only in a small subgroup of patients randomly selected in each of the three treatment groups. ZDV resistance-associated proviral DNA mutations were defined as low-level resistance (LLR) mutations or medium/high-level resistance (MHLR) mutations; clinical outcome was considered as stable or deteriorating. Results showed that at entry into the study the duration of ZDV therapy was significantly correlated with the presence of mutations, and that the level of resistance given by mutations was associated with the severity both of symptoms and immunodeficiency. After randomization to treatment, in patients with mutations that confer LLR a better clinical outcome with ddI monotherapy than with ZDV plus ddI and ZDV alone was observed in the subsequent 6 months, whereas in patients with mutations that confer MHLR no significant difference among the three treatment groups was found. Data showed also that levels of viral burden at the time of changing therapy are related to clinical outcome if measured by plasma viral load. These results suggest that genotypic resistance assays, together with viral load, may prove useful for rational treatment decisions both at the start of therapy and with failure."

Infectious clones with each mutation alone, all five mutations together, and various combinations of mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation Q151-->M conferred partial resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine, whereas a combination of four mutations conferred increased resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine. The positions of residues 75, 77, and 151 in the three-dimensional crystal structure of HIV-1 RT suggest that these residues may affect the ability of the enzyme to discriminate between deoxynucleoside triphosphates and nucleoside analog RT inhibitors. Replication experiments showed that clones with mutation F77-->L but without V75-->I (HIV-1(77), HIV-1(77,151), and HIV-1(77,116,151) had attenuated growth compared with that of the original HIV-1NL4-3 strain and strains containing mutations at both positions 75 and 77 (HIV-1(75,77,151) and HIV-1(75,77,116,15)). Sequence analysis of viral RNA and proviral DNA from several patients indicated that RT mutations developed in a sequential and cumulative pattern over the course of a 2- to 4-year observation period. The present results suggest that drug resistance and viral replicative capacity both may play a role in selection of HIV-1 RT mutations."
2471,0.005,1.0000,"Toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) continues to be a severe health problem despite the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). To identify predictors for development of TE we compared demographic, clinical and diagnostic variables in AIDS patients with TE before (n = 102) or after the introduction (n = 70) of HAART at the Charité University Medicine in Berlin, Germany. Interestingly, patient characteristics did not differ significantly in the pre- and post-HAART groups. Sixty-eight percent of patients had CD4-cell counts of <50/μl. Outcome after treatment with pyrimethamin plus sulfonamides or clindamycin (47% each) did not differ; adverse reactions were more frequent in patients receiving sulfonamides than in those receiving clindamycin (25% vs. 10.5%; p = 0.02). Interestingly, patients in the post HAART group had not received (82.9%) or had not taken HAART adequately (17.1%). Concurrent diagnosis of TE and HIV was significantly more often in the post- compared to the pre-HAART group (49 vs. 26%, respectively; p > 0.001). Thus, despite the introduction of HAART, awareness of opportunistic infections in HIV patients is warranted. High rates of unawareness of HIV infection should make public health efforts focus on early identification of HIV infection and initiation of and compliance with HAART."
1557,0.005,1.0000,"Although most hepatitis B virus (HBV) related chronic liver diseases manifest themselves in adulthood, HBV infection usually begins in infancy or early childhood in hyperendemic areas. The following factors affect the natural course of HBV: 1) host factors: a) initial age of infection: the younger the patient at infection, the more chance the disease will run a chronic course. Immune tolerance to hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and core antigen persists for a period of time in young children. b) the immune status of the host: the usage and tapering of immunosuppressants may induce a severe course with a fatal outcome; 2) maternal carrier status: children of HBeAg seropositive mothers are more immune tolerant to HBV, and thus have lower rates of HBeAg and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion; and 3) viral factors: mutations of the HBV precore, core or core promoter genes are related to fulminant hepatitis B or severe chronic hepatitis B. However, this is a matter of contention. Since July 1984, a nationwide HBV vaccination program has been successfully conducted in Taiwan. In 1994, the HBsAg carrier rate in Taipei city was reduced to < 1% in children younger than 10 years of age. Continuous efforts in immunoprophylaxis will hopefully further reduce the incidence of hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the next generation."
4554,0.005,1.0000,"Analysis of the preS1 gene of hepatitis B virus was used to define two nosocomial outbreaks of HBV infection. In an outbreak in an oncology unit we had previously shown by single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of a 189 bp fragment of the preS1 gene, that 52 children were infected with HBV strains that displayed only 5 different SSCP profiles. Sequencing of a 383 bp fragment encompassing the entire preS1 gene, revealed that isolates with same SSCP profile were identical in sequence across the entire preS1 gene, confirming that those patients with the same SSCP pattern had epidemiologically linked infections. A second outbreak involved 8 liver transplant patients from two different hospitals, 5 of whom were from the same hospital at which the oncology outbreak had occurred. Two of these 5 patients had HBV strains that were identical to strains from the oncology unit and nosocomial transmission probably accounted for the infections in these two, while diversity of both SSCP profiles and sequence data of remaining 6 patients supported the conclusion that they had not been infected from a common source. The donor liver is believed to be the most likely source of infection in these patients. HBV isolates from patients infected in the community were used as a standard for the general degree of preS1 sequence variation of local HBV strains. Phylogenetic analysis and comparison with reference HBV clones revealed that of 27 local HBV strains, genotypes A and D occurred most frequently and were identified in 14 and 12 patients respectively, while genotype C was detected in one patient."

PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector and positive clones were sequenced. The analysis of neighbor-joining tree, N-glycosylation sites, values of ds/dn, and loop were then all performed. The samples were all identified as HIV-1 B and genetic variation existed in HIV-1 gp120 isolated from different tissues. Compared with standard HIV-1B gp120, biological functional sites of HIV-1 gp120 isolated from the patient changed to some extent. In addition, there were differences in some biological functional sites of HIV-1 gp120 between lymphoid and brain. Therefore, genetic diversity and alterations of some biological functional sites of HIV-1 gp120 might be associated with the pathogenesis of ADC."
8723,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus-associated acute liver failure (HBV-ALF) is a rare but life-threatening syndrome that carried a high morbidity and mortality. Our study aimed to explore the possible molecular mechanisms of HBV-ALF by means of bioinformatics analysis. In this study, genes expression microarray datasets of HBV-ALF from Gene Expression Omnibus were collected, and then we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by the limma package in R. After functional enrichment analysis, we constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes online database and weighted genes coexpression network by the WGCNA package in R. Subsequently, we picked out the hub genes among the DEGs. A total of 423 DEGs with 198 upregulated genes and 225 downregulated genes were identified between HBV-ALF and normal samples. The upregulated genes were mainly enriched in immune response, and the downregulated genes were mainly enriched in complement and coagulation cascades. Orosomucoid 1 (ORM1), orosomucoid 2 (ORM2), plasminogen (PLG), and aldehyde oxidase 1 (AOX1) were picked out as the hub genes that with a high degree in both PPI network and weighted genes coexpression network. The weighted genes coexpression network analysis found out 3 of the 5 modules that upregulated genes enriched in were closely related to immune system. The downregulated genes enriched in only one module, and the genes in this module majorly enriched in the complement and coagulation cascades pathway. In conclusion, 4 genes (ORM1, ORM2, PLG, and AOX1) with immune response and the complement and coagulation cascades pathway may take part in the pathogenesis of HBV-ALF, and these candidate genes and pathways could be therapeutic targets for HBV-ALF."

Individuals homozygous for the delta ccr5 allele resist primary macrophage-tropic HIV-1 infection, despite multiple high-risk sexual exposures. This gene deletion is relatively common among Caucasians but uncommon among Africans, Asians, and South Americans. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to determine the frequency of the delta ccr5 allele in a Taiwanese population with diverse health status and social backgrounds. Subjects included 24 HIV-1-infected persons in the northern and southern parts of Taiwan; 131 HIV-1 high-risk, licensed female sex workers in the northern part of the island (21% of whom were aborigines); and 187 unrelated, healthy, HIV-1-negative individuals in southern Taiwan. PCR with primers encompassing the entire CCR5 gene was used to explore possible deletions at regions other than the 32-nucleotide area in the female sex workers. No ccr5 deletions were detected, indicating that they are rare or absent in the Taiwanese population. This finding implies that delta ccr5 is not likely to be part of the defense against the spread of HIV-1-infection in Taiwanese."

In all, 204 chronically HBV-infected patients were recruited in this study. Of the 204 HBV-infected patients, 43 were considered to be inactive HBV carriers based on the sustained normalization of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) together with seropositivity for the antibody to hepatitis B e-antigen (anti-HBe). A total of 161 patients were found to have chronic progressive liver disease, which included cirrhosis. In these HBV-infected patients, the frequencies of AA genotype of IL-18 gene-promoter polymorphisms at position -607 and C allele at position -137 were significantly higher in inactive HBV carriers compared with those in patients with chronic progressive liver disease. These polymorphisms of the IL-18 promoter regions (-607 and -137) could be associated with different outcomes of HBV infection."
5631,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-associated particles were purified from the serum of an experimentally infected chimpanzee by size chromatography and by density centrifugation. Hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) was detected after mild detergent treatment at a column elution volume corresponding to 36-nm particles and banded at a density of 1.25 g/ml. The serum had an estimated titer of 10(9) to 10(10) HDV-associated particles and had only a 10-fold excess of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) not associated with HDAg. Therefore, HDV appears to be much more efficiently packed and secreted than is its helper virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is usually accompanied by a 1,000-fold excess of HBsAg. The protein compositions of the HDAg-containing particles were analyzed by immunoblotting with HDAg-, HBsAg-, and hepatitis B core antigen-specific antisera and monoclonal antibodies to HBV surface gene products. The HBsAg envelope of HDAg contained approximately 95% P24/GP27s, 5% GP33/36s, and 1% P39/GP42s proteins. This protein composition was more similar to that of the 22-nm particles of HBsAg than to that of complete HBV. The significant amount of GP33/36s suggests that the HBsAg component of the HDV-associated particle carries the albumin receptor. Two proteins of 27 and 29 kilodaltons which specifically bound antibody to HDAg but not HBV-specific antibodies were detected in the interior of the 36-nm particle. Since these proteins were structural components of HDAg and were most likely coded for by HDV, they were designated P27d and P29d."

6136,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), use of insulin and statins was associated with reduced cancer risk while co-presence of low LDL cholesterol (LDLC <2.8 mmol/l) plus low triglyceride (TG; <1.7 mmol/l) increased cancer risk. There is experimental evidence showing that insulin insufficiency might promote HCC. In this study, we examined whether this lipid subphenotype and use of insulin or statins might modify the promoting effect of chronic HBV infection (indicated by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen) on HCC. We analyzed data of 1319 T2D patients enrolled into the Hong Kong Diabetes Registry from December 1996 to January 2005 and followed up to 2005. Additive interaction was estimated using relative excess risk due to interaction and attributable proportion due to interaction. During 5782 person-years of follow-up, 1.74% (n=23) of patients developed HCC (incidence, 3.98; 95% confidence interval, 2.36-5.60/1000 person-years). HbA1c ≥7.0% and the lipid phenotype (LDLC <2.8 mmol/l plus TG <1.7 mmol/l) increased the hazard ratios (HRs) of chronic HBV infection for HCC from 3.74 to 74.96 and from 11.01 to 89.82 respectively with significant interactions. Use of insulin or statins decreased the HRs from 37.51 to 5.87 and from 64.94 to 16.99 respectively with significant interactions (all P values <0.05). These findings support our hypothesis that hyperglycemia and co-presence of low LDLC plus low TG might enhance, while insulin or statin usage might attenuate the promoting effect of chronic HBV infection on HCC in T2D."

First, 1,151 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis and 181 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis, well matched for age, sex, and severity of cirrhosis, were reviewed retrospectively. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was higher in HCV-related cirrhosis (23.6%) than in HBV-related cirrhosis (9.4%; odds ratio [OR], 2.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-4.79; P =.0002). The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was associated closely with the Child-Pugh score (OR, 3.83; 95% CI, 2. 38-6.17; P <.0001) and increasing age (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.03; P =.0117). Second, 235 patients with biopsy confirmed chronic HBV or HCV underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. Only 1 of 70 patients with chronic viral hepatitis without cirrhosis was diabetic. However, 31 of 127 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis (24.4%) were diabetic compared with 3 of 38 patients with HBV-related cirrhosis (7.9%, P =.0477). The major variables associated with NIDDM were cirrhosis (OR, 14.39; 95% CI, 1.91-108; P =.0096) and male sex (OR, 4.64; 95% CI, 1. 32-16.18; P =.0161). Fasting insulin levels in 30 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus were elevated significantly, which was consistent with insulin resistance. However, acute insulin responsiveness was reduced in all patients with HCV infection and diabetes suggesting concomitant B-cell dysfunction. This study confirms an association between HCV and NIDDM."

Exenatide lowers postprandial blood glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and increasing satiety. Therapy with exenatide often results in weight loss, which further assists in decreasing insulin resistance. This feature makes the drug an attractive therapeutic option for obese patients. We report the successful off-label use of exenatide in an obese, 40-year-old man with type 1 diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who had gastrointestinal intolerance to pramlintide. The patient had experienced a dramatic weight gain secondary to his antiretroviral drugs. This weight gain led to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes; thus he had characteristics of both types 1 and 2 diabetes, or double diabetes. Before the start of exenatide therapy, he weighed 123 kg, had a body mass index of 42.3 kg/m(2), and had a suboptimal hemoglobin A(1c) value of 8.7%. After 11 months of therapy, the patient lost 24 kg (19.5% of his body weight) and achieved a hemoglobin A(1c) value of 7.3%. His basal insulin requirement was reduced by 25%, and his use of short-acting insulin before breakfast and before dinner was discontinued. In addition, the patient's quality of life substantially improved, as he was able to return to work and exercise after being nearly incapacitated by his weight. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of the use of exenatide in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Given this experience, exenatide may prove to be a useful alternative in selected patients with type 1 diabetes."

The availability of reliable noninvasive tools to measure liver fibrosis has permitted the screening of large patient populations. Cross-sectional study of all consecutive HIV outpatients who underwent examination by transient elastometry (FibroScan) at one HIV reference clinic during 2007. Advanced liver fibrosis (ALF) was defined as hepatic stiffness >9.5 kilopascals, which corresponds to Metavir stages F3-F4 in the liver biopsy. A total of 681 consecutive HIV-infected patients (64% injecting drug users; mean age 43; 78% male; 98% on antiretroviral therapy) had at least one valid FibroScan evaluation. ALF was diagnosed in 215 (32%) of them. In the univariate analysis, ALF was significantly associated with older age, low CD4 counts, chronic hepatitis C, past alcohol abuse, elevated ALT, high triglycerides, low cholesterol, high homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index and exposure to didanosine and/or stavudine. In a multivariate model (OR, 95% CI), chronic hepatitis C (2.83, 1.57-5.08), past alcohol abuse (2.26, 1.37-3.74), exposure to didanosine and/or stavudine (1.85, 1.14-3.01), high HOMA index (1.25, 1.04-1.51), older age (1.09, 1.05-1.14) and elevated ALT (1.04, 1.03-1.06) remained as independently associated with ALF.

Due to relatively frequent adverse effects, d4T gradually has been replaced with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Although the frequency of adverse drug effects with TDF is lower than that with d4T, TDF is known to induce kidney dysfunction, especially in the proximal tubules. It has been reported that renal tubular transporters, including members of the multi-drug resistant (MDR) protein family, are implicated in tenofovir extrusion and may, therefore, confer susceptibility to TDF-induced kidney tubular dysfunction (KTD). We have explored the association between KTD and polymorphisms in genes that encode adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC)-type MDRs."

Furthermore, pretreatment CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio, but not CD4 counts, correlated with the main immunological alterations observed in immunodiscordants, including increased regulatory T-cell (Treg) frequency and T-cell turnover-related markers. Then, in a larger cohort, only baseline CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio was independently associated with immunodiscordance, after adjusting by the viral CXCR4-tropic HIV variants. Our results suggest that the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio could be an accurate biomarker of the subjacent immunological damage triggering immunodiscordance."
4332,0.005,1.0000,"Chronicity in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is maintained by increased type 2 T-helper cell response, possibly because of increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) productions. B7-H1 can negatively regulate T-cell responses via its receptor, programmed death 1. Ligation of B7-H1 to T-cells can result in the preferential secretion of IL-10. In this study, we investigated whether there was an upregulated expression of B7-H1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients chronically infected by HBV and further explored the correlation between B7-H1 expression and serum interleukin 2, interferon-gamma, IL-10, HBeAg, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and viral load. Fifty-five patients with chronic HBV infection and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in the present study. The results showed that in patients with chronic hepatitis B CD14+ monocytes but not CD3+ and CD19+ cells had a significantly increased expression of B7-H1 compared with HCs, which positively correlates with serum IL-10 levels and the presence of HBeAg and negatively correlates with serum ALT levels. In conclusion, chronic HBV patients harbour an increased B7-H1 expression in CD14+ monocytes compared with controls, which may be responsible for the increased serum IL-10 levels. This might be an important way by which HBV evades an adequate immune response, leading to viral persistence and disease chronicity."
6894,0.005,1.0000,"The complexity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) immunopathogenesis has prompted multiple strategic approaches to re-establish normal immune responses. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can control viral replication, but it is unable to restore HIV-specific immunity. Newer approaches for managing HIV infection are focusing on cell-mediated immune responses, including the potential for improved immunologic control over HIV replication. Cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-12, are being evaluated for their ability to enhance cell-mediated immunity, which is thought to be critical for immunologic control. Initial studies with IL-2 have demonstrated an improvement in CD4 cell counts, and large randomized trials are underway to determine the long-term clinical efficacy of IL-2 in combination with antiretroviral therapy, including HAART. Stimulating the immune response against HIV by use of exogenous (therapeutic vaccination) or endogenous (structured treatment interruption) antigens with or without immune adjuvants or cytokines, such as IL-2, is another approach currently being explored."

6437,0.005,1.0000,"Immigration from developing regions to Western countries has resulted in an increased rate of non-B subtypes in the HIV population. However, it is unclear whether these HIV variants remain confined to foreigners or are already spreading among natives. Since many immigrants come from regions in which hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are endemic, HIV-hepatitis coinfection might be more frequent in newly diagnosed HIV persons. Herein, we report changes in the prevalence and distribution of HIV-1 subtypes in Madrid, Spain over the past 10 years as well as the rate of chronic HBV and HCV coinfection in 1854 newly diagnosed HIV-1 individuals. Overall 18.2% carried HIV-1 non-B subtypes, although the prevalence increased over time reaching a peak of 19.4% in the last period (2007-2010). The most common non-B variants were CRF02_AG (37%), G (12%), A (9.9%), and C (7.8%). In native Spaniards the rate of non-B subtypes increased from 1.5% in 2000-2002 to 7.2% in 2003-2006 and to 11.4% in 2007-2010 (p = 0.04). Chronic hepatitis B and C were found, respectively, in 4.2% and 8.3% of the study population. While the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B has remained fairly stable over time across distinct populations, the rate of chronic HCV infection has experienced a significant decline, mainly in native Spaniards as a result of a reduction in intravenous drug use. In summary, the prevalence of HIV-1 non-B subtypes is rising in newly diagnosed HIV-1 individuals in Spain, including the native population. In contrast, the rate of HBV coinfection remains unchanged and the rate of HCV coinfection has declined."
7223,0.005,1.0000,"The emergence of improved antiretroviral therapy has increased the life expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, although there is an increased susceptibility to developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The risk for CVD is purported to be even higher among people with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection because of the increased inflammatory response, which may synergistically impact CVD risk. However, studies comparing CVD outcomes between HIV alone and HIV/HCV individuals have been discordant. Accordingly, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify and quantify the association between HIV/HCV coinfection and the risk for CVD. We searched EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science from inception to December 2016 to identify studies that provided information on HIV/HCV coinfection and CVD, defined as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and stroke. We used a random-effects model to abstract and pool data on the hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD. HRs were adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors including age, sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and LDL cholesterol. Among the 283 articles reviewed, four cohort studies met inclusion criteria with a total of 33 723 participants. The pooled adjusted HRs for the association between HIV/HCV coinfection and CVD were 1.24 (95% CI: 1.07-1.40) compared to HIV monoinfection. The test for heterogeneity was not statistically significant (I"
8856,0.005,1.0000,"We report 2 cases of patients with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) associated with cutaneous disseminated sporotrichosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. The patients received specific treatment for sporotrichosis. However, after 4 and 5 weeks from the beginning of antiretroviral therapy, both patients experienced clinical exacerbation of skin lesions despite increased T CD4+ cells (T cells cluster of differentiation 4 positive) count and decreased viral load. Despite this exacerbation, subsequent mycological examination after systemic corticosteroid administration did not reveal fungal growth. Accordingly, they were diagnosed with IRIS. However, the sudden withdrawal of the corticosteroids resulted in the recurrence of IRIS symptoms. No serious adverse effects could be attributed to prednisone. We recommend corticosteroid treatment for mild-to-moderate cases of IRIS in sporotrichosis and HIV coinfection with close follow-up. "
8193,0.005,1.0000,"We describe a North American human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patient with Strongyloides stercoralis infection of the gastrointestinal tract, who required repeated ""standard"" courses of thiabendazole. Pulmonary infection with numerous roundworms developed, as suspected by bronchoalveolar lavage, and while he was receiving therapy, dissemination occurred. On autopsy, S stercoralis was recovered in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung, and heart. After a literature review, we conclude that HIV-positive patients have a higher risk of dissemination and ""standard"" treatment failure. This may occur without elevation of IgE or eosinophilia. Those patients may require prolonged courses of thiabendazole or alternatively ivermectin therapy."
2564,0.005,1.0000,"The use of gallium scanning in the treatment of patients with AIDS has been well described. In this study, 27 HIV-infected patients (Walter Reed Staging Classification I-V) with normal chest roentgenograms were evaluated to determine the occurrence of thoracic gallium abnormalities in early HIV infection. SPECT was used for gallium scanning. Patients received gallium injection on day 1 and bronchoalveolar lavage on day 2, and scanning was performed on day 3. Twenty-eight scans in 27 patients were performed. Mean nodal SPECT activity was compared with corresponding values for lung parenchyma, bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts, and peripheral blood T4 lymphocyte counts. No relationship between nodal and parenchymal activity and cell counts was observed. Although visual scan interpretation was unaffected, gallium activity was significantly increased in the region of bronchoalveolar lavage compared with uptake in other lung regions. It is concluded that SPECT gallium scanning demonstrates significant gallium avidity in recently lavaged lung areas, although no impact on visual scan interpretation was seen. Further, no correlation was seen between the degree of nodal uptake and the immunologic status of these patients with early HIV infection."
1445,0.005,1.0000,We report Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage cytology and transbronchial lung biopsy in three out of five human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive adult patients presenting with interstitial pneumonitis. One of these patients was serologically positive for HIV at the time of presentation and the remaining two patients were detected to be HIV positive on follow up after the diagnosis had been established. All the three patients were treated with co-trimoxazole. One patient recovered and was discharged; another patient improved with treatment but died after jugular vein cannulation and the third patient succumbed to cryptosporidial diarrhoea. The remaining two patients with non-specific interstitial pneumonitis treated with prednisolone and bronchodilators were recovered and were discharged from the hospital.
1268,0.005,1.0000,"We prospectively evaluated the diagnostic value of blind brushing of the esophagus via nasogastric tube in 66 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (N = 59), or AIDS-related complex (ARC), (N = 7)] complaining of odynophagia and/or dysphagia. Brushings were obtained between 20 and 35 cm from the incisors. Patients then underwent upper endoscopy with directed brushings and biopsies; esophageal lavage was also done in the first 40 patients. Candida esophagitis was defined as an abnormal appearance of the esophageal mucosa, together with microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae in the endoscopic brushings or invasive candidiasis on biopsy. The presence of oral thrush was also recorded. Candida esophagitis was present in 28 (42%) of the 66 patients. Blind brushings diagnosed candidiasis in 27/28 cases and produced five false positives (sensitivity 96%, specificity 87%). Blind brushing of the esophagus was significantly more sensitive than the presence of oral thrush for the diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis (p = 0.02). Oral thrush was found in only 20/28 cases of Candida esophagitis and in eight patients without Candida (sensitivity 71%, specificity 79%). Esophageal lavage yielded Candida in all cases (sensitivity 100%) but had a poor specificity (64%). We conclude that blind brushing of the esophagus is a rapid, safe, and economical way to diagnose Candida esophagitis in patients with AIDS. This procedure can be performed by primary care physicians with minimal loss of sensitivity and specificity as compared to endoscopy."

Among the existing viral causes for hepatic failure, hepatitis B virus (HBV) plays a significant role with devastating implications, especially when combined with other viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Co-infection with hepatitis B virus and HIV leads to increased morbidity and mortality as compared to independent HIV and HBV infections. In this study, we aimed to assess the seroprevalence of HBV and HIV coinfection and associated risk factors among pregnant women in a selected hospital facility around Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."

After a median duration of observation of 25 months, coinfected patients were more likely to develop hepatitis (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69-3.82) and hepatic decompensation (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 9.94; 95% CI, 1.89-52.35).

5629,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment with antiretroviral agents (ARVs) during pregnancy is important to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but their use has been associated with low bone mineral density in adult patients. Currently, there are no data regarding the bone status of HIV-infected women who received ARV during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to evaluate cortical bone status at delivery in a group of HIV-infected women who received ARV during pregnancy and to monitor the changes occurring during the first year postpartum. We studied 33 HIV-infected and 116 HIV-uninfected healthy Caucasian women within 4 days from delivery. Follow-up measurements were performed at 4 and 12 months postpartum in 17 HIV-infected and 55 healthy women. Cortical bone status was evaluated by quantitative ultrasonography at the mid-tibia, and bone measurements were expressed as the speed of sound (SOS). HIV-infected women after delivery had a median SOS of 3,985 (3,567-4,242) m/s, while the median SOS of healthy women was 4,025 (3,643-4,250) m/s. The difference was not significant (t = 0.39, P = 0.69). No significant differences were observed between ARV-exposed and control subjects at 4 and 12 months. Our data suggest that ARV during pregnancy and the first year after delivery does not affect negatively cortical bone status."
595,0.005,1.0000,"Variation in the env (V3 region) and gag (p17 region) genes of genomic RNA of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 was studied in three mother-child pairs. One infant was human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA positive at birth (pair 114), one became positive 6 weeks after birth (pair 127), and one became positive 30 months after birth (pair 564). The first two children were born to seropositive mothers, and the last child was infected by breast-feeding following seroconversion of the mother after delivery. In both V3 and p17gag, intrasample variability was much higher in the maternal samples, including the first seropositive sample of the seroconverted mother, than in the infants' samples. Variability was less in p17gag than in V3, except in the postnatally infected child. In all three cases, infection of the child was established by variants representing a minority of the cell-free virus population in the maternal samples. For the two infants born to seropositive mothers, V3 sequences were more similar to the sequence populations of maternal samples collected during pregnancy than to those of samples collected at delivery or thereafter. However, in pair 114 a V3 variant identical to the child's virus was also detected in the sample collected at delivery. In contrast to the V3 region, p17gag sequences of maternal samples of the first trimester of pregnancy and at delivery had comparable resemblance to the child's sequences in pair 114, while in pair 127, similarity to sequences of the sample collected at delivery was higher than that to sequences of the sample from early in pregnancy. In the last pair, V3 and p17gag sequences from a maternal sample collected 18 months prior to the first RNA-positive sample of the child resembled the infant's sequences as much as the sample collected close to the presumed time of infection. Taken together, the evolutionary characteristics for genomic RNA env and gag genes did not point to a particular time of mother-to-child transmission."
3587,0.005,1.0000,"Quantitative serum antibody to p24 was evaluated as a predictor of risk of vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. HIV-positive mothers, 13 with HIV-infected children and 24 with noninfected children were investigated during pregnancy and at the time of delivery. A statistically significant difference in anti-p24 titers was found between the mothers with infected and those with noninfected children independent of whether antibodies were measured during pregnancy or at the time of delivery. High anti-p24 levels correlated with a low risk of vertical transmission, whereas low anti-p24 titers were associated with an increased risk of vertical transmission. Although the number of CD4+ T-cells was lower and neopterin and beta-2 microglobulin values were higher in the group of mothers with infected children than in the noninfected group, no statistical significance was achieved due to the small sample size."
7221,0.005,1.0000,"Delivery by elective cesarean section (ECS), cesarean section prior to labor and rupture of membranes, is associated with a lower rate of vertical transmission of HIV compared with other modes of delivery. The efficacy of ECS among women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy or among women with low viral loads is unknown. In assessing the possible utility of ECS as an intervention to decrease vertical transmission in the United States and other countries, the potential risks associated with operative delivery as well as other considerations should also be addressed. Although cesarean section delivery is associated with an increased rate of postpartum morbidity compared with vaginal delivery in the general population, operative delivery performed emergently carries a higher risk of complications than scheduled or elective procedures. Analyses of the risk of postpartum morbidity according to mode of delivery among HIV-infected women have been performed in the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the largest database in North America with relevant data, as well as other, smaller databases. These analyses suggest a similar pattern to that observed in the general population. In addition to quantifying the incidence of postpartum morbidity events, it is also important to distinguish between minor and major morbidity. Neonatal morbidity related to ECS is generally due to iatrogenic preterm birth, that is, situations where the gestational age is not accurately assessed prior to delivery. Occupationally acquired HIV infection related to obstetric procedures is a possibility, although risk related to mode of delivery is unknown. The results of economic analyses of ECS compared to vaginal delivery in the US indicate that ECS is a cost-effective intervention in preventing vertical transmission of HIV among women who refrain from breastfeeding. However, more precise estimates of the risk of vertical transmission among women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and of the potential risks of maternal and pediatric adverse events related to receipt of such therapy are needed. In summary, the benefit of ECS must be weighed against potential risks, and issues such as cost-effectiveness also should be taken into consideration."

To evaluate factors associated with an undetectable VL near delivery in HIV-infected pregnant women receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and non-HAART regimens, HIV-infected pregnant women with a detectable VL at entry and having used antiretrovirals for ≥4 weeks before delivery were selected. Multivariate analysis was employed using binary logistic unconditional models; the dependent variable was having a VL <400 copies/mL near delivery. VL suppression was achieved in 403/707 women (57%): 65.4% in the HAART group, but only 26% in the non-HAART group P = 0.001. Duration of HAART was correlated with VL suppression, with maximum benefit seen after ≥12 weeks of therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.72-3.65). CD4+ cell count near delivery (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.06-2.20) and baseline VL (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.58-0.94) were also independently associated with VL suppression. Overall MTCT rate was 1.6%. HAART for ≥12 weeks, baseline VL and CD4 cell count near delivery were independently associated with viral suppression near delivery."
2221,0.005,1.0000,"Sequences from the nef/LTR overlap region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) genome were amplified from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 40 HIV-2-infected individuals in The Gambia, West Africa. Additional sequences from the plasma of three blood donors were also derived. Analysis of HIV-2 U3 LTR transcription factor elements (PuB-1, p-ets, PuB-2, peri-kappa B, and NF-kappa B sites) indicated a relatively high level of conservation in vivo. The region immediately 3' of the nef termination codon, which exhibits clade-dependent specificity, was targeted by PCR to differentiate HIV-2 subtype A from subtype B infections, the two principal clinical HIV-2 subtypes. All clinical samples analyzed (n = 43) from The Gambia were identified as HIV-2 subtype A by a combination of LTR sequence analysis and subtype-specific amplification of subtypes A and B. Differential PCR amplification of the HIV-2 U3 LTR region represents a rapid means of differentiating subtype A from subtype B infections, the two dominant HIV-2 subtypes that are important in human disease."
2407,0.005,1.0000,"The clinical significance of persistent residual viremia in patients on prolonged highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is not clear. Moreover, it remains to be demonstrated whether residual viremia consists of viruses capable of spreading infection in vivo upon termination of therapy. Using residual viral RNAs (vRNAs) isolated from a HAART-treated patient's plasma, we cloned full-length viral genomes and found that most of them could produce infectious, replication-competent HIVs when transfected into TZM-bl cells, suggesting that residual viruses produced in the absence of therapy can initiate fresh cycles of infection and spread in host cells. The data further indicate that residual viremia may pose a major concern with regard to the emergence of drug-resistant HIVs during periods of low adherence to therapy."
2069,0.005,1.0000,"Musculoskeletal manifestations and autoimmune phenomena are recently recognized complications of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patients with HIV infection share several clinical and serologic features with patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome; these similarities may lead to diagnostic confusion. The significance of the presence of different types of autoantibodies in HIV-infected patients is still uncertain and may reflect polyclonal B cell activation. Musculoskeletal complications--particularly arthritis, arthralgia, and myalgia--are common in advanced stages of HIV infection. Clinical characteristics and serologic findings support the premise that most of the musculoskeletal complications (e.g., Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated arthritis and arthralgias) are reactive in nature--either a direct consequence of HIV infection or a result of various opportunistic infections. The possibility of HIV infection should be considered in all patients with conditions suggesting reactive arthritis. Further studies are needed to define the full spectrum and frequency of these musculoskeletal abnormalities."
4301,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of dendritic cells (DCs) plays an important role in HIV-1 transmission and pathogenesis. Here, we studied the susceptibility of ex vivo-isolated CD11c+ myeloid DCs (MDCs) and CD123+ plasmacytoid DCs (PDCs) to HIV-1 infection and the function of these cells early after infection. Both DC subsets were susceptible to CCR5- and CXCR4-using HIV-1 isolates (BaL and IIIB, respectively). However, MDCs were more susceptible to HIV-1(BaL) infection than donor-matched PDCs. In addition, HIV-1(BaL) infected MDCs more efficiently than HIV-1(IIIB), whereas PDCs were equally susceptible to both isolates. While exposure to HIV-1 alone resulted in only weak maturation of DCs, Toll-like receptor 7/8 ligation induced full maturation in both infected and uninfected DCs. Maturation did not increase HIV-1 replication in infected DCs, and infected DCs retained their ability to produce tumor necrosis factor alpha after stimulation. Both HIV-1 isolates induced alpha interferon production exclusively in PDCs, irrespective of productive infection. In conclusion, PDCs and MDCs were susceptible to HIV-1 infection, but neither displayed functional defects as a consequence of infection. The difference in susceptibility of PDCs and MDCs to HIV-1 may have implications for HIV-1 transmission and DC-mediated transfer of HIV-1 to T cells."

To compare the geographic distribution of HBV genotypes in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in Japan between 2005 and 2006 and between 2000 and 2001, with special attention to changes in the proportion of HBV/A, a cohort study was performed to survey changes in genotypes of CHB patients at 16 hospitals throughout Japan. Furthermore, we investigated the clinical characteristics of each genotype and examined the genomic characteristics of HBV/A isolates by molecular evolutionary analyses. Of the 1,271 patients, 3.5%, 14.1%, and 82.3% were infected with HBV/A, -B, and -C, respectively. In comparison with our previous survey during 2000 and 2001, HBV/A was twice as frequent (3.5% versus 1.7%; P = 0.02). The mean age was lower in the patients with HBV/A than in those with HBV/B or -C. Based on phylogenetic analyses of 11 full-length genomes and 29 pre-S2/S region sequences from patients, HBV/A isolates were imported from Europe and the United States, as well as the Philippines and India. They clustered with HBV/A from AHB patients and have spread throughout Japan. HBV/A has been increasing in CHB patients in Japan as a consequence of AHB spreading in the younger generation through promiscuous sexual contacts, aided by a tendency of HBV/A to induce chronic hepatitis. The spread of HBV/A infection in Japan should be prevented by universal vaccination programs."
8390,0.005,1.0000,"Over the previous years, comprehensive studies on antiretroviral drugs resulted in the successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) into clinical practice for treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there is still need for new therapeutic approaches, since HAART cannot eradicate HIV-1 from the infected organism and, unfortunately, can be associated with long-term toxicity and the development of drug resistance. In contrast, novel gene therapy strategies may have the potential to reverse the infection by eradicating HIV-1. For example, expression of long terminal repeat (LTR)-specific recombinase (Tre-recombinase) has been shown to result in chromosomal excision of proviral DNA and, in consequence, in the eradication of HIV-1 from infected cell cultures. However, the delivery of Tre-recombinase currently depends on the genetic manipulation of target cells, a process that is complicating such therapeutic approaches and, thus, might be undesirable in a clinical setting. In this report we demonstrate that E.coli expressed Tre-recombinases, tagged either with the protein transduction domain (PTD) from the HIV-1 Tat trans-activator or the translocation motif (TLM) of the Hepatitis B virus PreS2 protein, were able to translocate efficiently into cells and showed significant recombination activity on HIV-1 LTR sequences. Tre activity was observed using episomal and stable integrated reporter constructs in transfected HeLa cells. Furthermore, the TLM-tagged enzyme was able to excise the full-length proviral DNA from chromosomal integration sites of HIV-1-infected HeLa and CEM-SS cells. The presented data confirm Tre-recombinase activity on integrated HIV-1 and provide the basis for the non-genetic transient application of engineered recombinases, which may be a valuable component of future HIV eradication strategies."
4386,0.005,1.0000,"Implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has deeply changed the landscape of HIV-associated malignancies. Some AIDS-defining tumors, namely Primitive Lymphoma of Central Nervous System, have drastically declined, whereas a steady increase has been observed for non-AIDS-defining tumors, maybe due to longer survival of HIV-infected people. Easier immune restoration, subsequent to availability of a number of drugs targeting HIV at different points, has decreased opportunistic infections which hampered treatment of HIV-associated cancers. As a matter of fact these patients have been assimilated more and more with their negative counterpart, undergoing the same aggressive approach. Consistently, procedures that have been so far precluded to HIV+ subjects, such as transplant of hemopoietic stem cells, either autologous or allogenic, and liver transplant are expected to be performed more and more extensively in this population. Which also would mean a full removal of the stigma which has weighed on it. Hence, it is true-like that malignancies and related problems may in the next future make up a main concern for the HIV specialist. Old and new challenges might be the drug-drug interaction of antiretrovirals or biotherapy-related infections or the debated question of an earlier HAART implementation in the course of HIV disease, with CD4+ cells > 500/μl. In fact, if assimilation of HIV patients with cancer and the general population is a remarkable achieved goal, uniqueness of HIV infection in terms of immune status still makes HIV-associated cancer a unique chapter in the setting of Oncology."
2031,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is more prevalent than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but more public health resources are allocated to HIV than to HCV. Given shared risk factors and epidemiology, we compared accuracy of health beliefs about HIV and HCV in an at-risk community. Between 2002 and 2003, we surveyed a random patient sample at a primary care clinic in New York. The survey was organized as domains of Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation: causes ('sharing needles'), timeline/consequences ('remains in body for life', 'causes cancer') and controllability ('I can avoid this illness', 'medications may cure this illness'). We compared differences in accuracy of beliefs about HIV and HCV and used multivariable linear regression to identify factors associated with relative accuracy of beliefs. One hundred and twenty-two subjects completed the survey (response rate 42%). Mean overall health belief accuracy was 12/15 questions (80%) for HIV vs 9/15 (60%) for HCV (P < 0.001). Belief accuracy was significantly different across all domains. Within the causes domain, 60% accurately believed sharing needles a risk factor for HCV compared to 92% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the timeline/consequences domain, 42% accurately believed HCV results in lifelong infection compared to 89% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the controllability domain, 25% accurately believed that there is a potential cure for HCV. Multivariable linear regression revealed female gender as significantly associated with greater health belief accuracy for HIV. Thus, study participants had significantly less accurate health beliefs about HCV than about HIV. Targeting inaccuracies might improve public health interventions to foster healthier behaviours and better hepatitis C outcomes."

Although the HBV genotype distribution has been determined in some parts of South Central Asia, no survey has been conducted to determine the HBV genotype in Afghanistan. Twelve Afghan patients infected with HBV living in Afghanistan were enrolled in this study. Partial HBsAg and basic core promoter, precore, and core (BCP/preC/C) regions were amplified and subjected for direct sequencing. In parallel, precore G1896A mutation was also determined by an amplification-created restriction site method. Results revealed HBV genotype D (95% bootstrap value), sub-genotype D1 (98% bootstrap value), and subtype ayw2 in all Afghan isolates. Afghan isolates clustered in a separate branch in the D1 sub-genotype called D1', while supported by 82% bootstrap value. The percentage of intra-genotypic distance among Afghan isolates was 1.05% and inter-genotypic distance with the other genotype D was 2.87% and with other genotypes was 7.50%-11.1%. The wild-type, mixed infection, and precore mutant were found in six, two, and four HBV isolates, respectively. The A1762T/G1764A BCP dual mutation was found in one isolate. Three isolates presented single mutation in the BCP dual mutation region, whereas two showed a novel G1764T mutation. In conclusion, this preliminary study revealed HBV genotype D, sub-genotype D1, and subtype ayw2 of HBV among hepatitis B infected patients from Afghanistan.

Residues 79, 94, and 96 were all found to be phosphorylated, as assessed by alanine mutations. Mutation of Ser-79 to Ala abrogated effects of Vpr on cell cycle progression, whereas mutation of Ser-94 and Ser-96 had no effect.

9298,0.005,1.0000,"Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common because of their shared modes of transmission. HIV infection alters the natural history of HBV infection, leading to more severe liver disease, decreased hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, and higher HBV DNA levels. Furthermore, end-stage liver disease has emerged as a common cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected persons receiving HAART. For these reasons, it is important to vaccinate susceptible persons against HBV infection and to diagnose and treat chronic hepatitis B in HIV-infected persons. The treatment plan for chronic hepatitis B needs to be individualized based on the stage of both viral infections and the available options. It is anticipated that we are entering a period of combination therapy for chronic hepatitis B, but the ideal combination needs to be elucidated."

Children born to HBsAg +/HBeAg + mothers (7% of neonates) have an estimated risk of 90% to become HBsAg chronic carriers. A plan for control of Hepatitis B in Taiwan will aim to solve the problem of these children, as a priority. A Hepatitis B vaccine trial has been undertaken in Taiwan since October 1981 in a selected population of children born to HBsAg +/HBeAg + mothers. The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of Hepatitis B vaccine alone or in combination with Hepatitis B immunoglobulin in preventing maternal infant transmission of HBV infection. A three way prophylactic regimen comparison was carried out. Subjects consisted of children born to HBsAg +/HBeAg + mothers.

1319,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had spread unrecognized in the human population as sexually transmitted disease and was finally identified by its disease AIDS in 1981. Even after the isolation of the causative agent in 1983, the burden and death rate of AIDS accelerated worldwide especially in young people despite the confection of new drugs capable to inhibit virus replication since 1997. However, at least in industrialised countries, this trend could be reversed by the introduction of combination therapy strategies. The design of new drugs is on going; besides the inhibition of the three enzymes of HIV for replication and maturation (reverse transcriptase, integrase and protease), further drugs inhibits fusion of viral and cellular membranes and virus maturation. On the other hand, viral diagnostics had been considerably improved since the emergence of HIV. There was a need to identify infected people correctly, to follow up the course of immune reconstitution of patients by measuring viral load and CD4 cells, and to analyse drug escape mutations leading to drug resistance. Both the development of drugs and the refined diagnostics have been transferred to the treatment of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). This progress is not completed; there are beneficial aspects in the response of the scientific community to the HIV burden for the management of other viral diseases. These aspects are described in this contribution. Further aspects as handling a stigmatising disease, education of self-responsiveness within sexual relationships, and ways for confection of a protective vaccine are not covered."
3271,0.005,1.0000,"Columbia University's International Centre for AIDS Care and Treatment Programmes (ICAP) supports the establishment of HIV prevention, care and treatment programmes, in resource-limited countries, through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. In South Africa (SA), ICAP has collaborated with the Eastern Cape Department of Health since 2004, to support HIV treatment and care programmes at public healthcare facilities in rural and urban areas. Adherence, psychosocial and other supportive services have been combined into Wellness Programmes that have been situated within hospital-based Wellness Centres in two rural regions, and integrated within primary healthcare facilities in a third. This paper reviews components of wellness services for people living with HIV/AIDS including: voluntary counselling and testing, disclosure and prevention, ongoing counselling, health literacy and peer education, community- and home-based care, adherence support, and associated comprehensive care continuums. It also describes local context in which the Wellness Programmes were established. Finally it describes processes, successes and challenges, with programme development, and useful indicators monitored, lessons learned and strategies to strengthen and expand such programmes. Insights provided may inform other efforts to create sustainable systems of interdisciplinary care and accessible psychosocial support for HIV-infected persons within public facilities in resource-constrained settings."
8516,0.005,1.0000,"Successful treatment of people infected with HIV requires that patients are retained in HIV care, use combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and ultimately reach and sustain viral suppression.

5055,0.005,1.0000,"In Ukraine, about one-third of identified HIV-positive individuals are not connected to care. We conducted a cross-sectional survey (n = 200) among patients registered at Odessa AIDS centers in October to December 2011. Factors associated with delayed enrollment in HIV care (>3 months since positive HIV test) were evaluated using logistic regression. Among study participants (mean age 35 ± 8.2 years, 47.5% female, 42.5% reported history of injecting drugs), 55% delayed HIV care enrollment. Odds of delayed enrollment were higher for those with lower educational attainment (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-6.76), not feeling ill (aOR: 2.98, 95% CI: 1.50-5.93), or not having time to go to the AIDS center (aOR: 3.89, 95% CI: 1.39-10.89); injection drug use was not associated with delayed enrollment. Programs linking HIV-positive individuals to specialized care should address enrollment barriers and include education on HIV care benefits and case management for direct linkage to care. HIV testing and treatment should be coupled to ensure a continuum of care."
9070,0.005,1.0000,"The persistence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is maintained by the nuclear viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which serves as transcription template for viral mRNAs. Previous studies suggested that cccDNA contains methylation-prone CpG islands, and that the minichromosome structure of cccDNA is epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation. However, the regulatory effect of each CpG island methylation on cccDNA activity remains elusive. In the present study, we analyzed the distribution of CpG methylation within cccDNA in patient samples and investigated the impact of CpG island methylation on cccDNA-driven virus replication. Our study revealed the following observations: 1) Bisulfite sequencing of cccDNA from chronic hepatitis B patients indicated that CpG island I was seldom methylated, 2) CpG island II methylation was correlated to the low level of serum HBV DNA in patients, and in vitro methylation studies confirmed that CpG island II methylation markedly reduced cccDNA transcription and subsequent viral core DNA replication, 3) CpG island III methylation was associated with low serum HBsAg titers, and 4) Furthermore, we found that HBV genotype, HBeAg positivity, and patient age and liver fibrosis stage were also relevant to cccDNA CpG methylation status. Therefore, we clearly demonstrated that the status of cccDNA methylation is connected to the biological behavior of HBV. Taken together, our study provides a complete profile of CpG island methylation within HBV cccDNA and new insights for the function of CpG methylation in regulating HBV cccDNA transcription. "
3899,0.005,1.0000,"In addition to CD4 T lymphocytes, HIV-1 infects tissue macrophages that can actively accumulate infectious virions in vacuolar subcellular structures mostly connected to the plasma membrane and recently termed virus-containing compartments (VCCs). The VCC-associated HIV-1 reservoir of infected macrophages can be either increased or depleted by immunologic and pharmacologic agents, at least in vitro, thus suggesting that these factors (or related molecules) could be effective in curtailing the macrophage-associated HIV-1 reservoir in infected individuals receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Here we review evidence on the pathogenic role of tissue macrophages as long-term viral reservoirs in vivo and upon in vitro infection with a particular emphasis on the immuno-pharmacological modulation of VCCs."
3647,0.005,1.0000,"Effective contact tracing for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection could enhance disease control, especially in populations with low HBV vaccination rates and high prevalence of untreated HCV infection. We evaluated a low-cost approach to HBV/HCV contact tracing in injection drug users (IDUs). Index cases (n=26) were IDUs who seroconverted to HBV and/or HCV during a prospective cohort study in Seattle. Interviewers elicited index cases' recent injection partners and administered recall cues and other techniques to boost recall. Index cases received vouchers for free hepatitis testing, which they were to give to locatable partners. Persons redeeming vouchers also received small monetary incentives. Most (26/40) seroconverters participated in the paid contact interviews. Index cases reported many partners (mean=17), and in the aggregate, index cases indicated they could refer more than one third of their elicited partners for testing. Overall, only 17 persons were ultimately referred and just eight of these were confirmed as partners sought for referral. The supplementary elicitation techniques, and especially the recall cues, increased reporting of injection partners substantially. The injection network constructed from reported partnerships was mostly connected and cyclic. Successful contact tracing in IDUs likely requires active involvement by public health staff to locate and notify exposed injection partners."
6333,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), the persistence of viral reservoirs remains a major barrier to curing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Recently, the shock and kill strategy, by which such reservoirs are eradicated following reactivation of latent HIV-1 by latency-reversing agents (LRAs), has been extensively practiced. It is important to reestablish virus-specific and reliable immune surveillance to eradicate the reactivated virus-harboring cells. In this report, we attempted to reach this goal by using newly developed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell technology. To generate anti-HIV-1 CAR-T cells, we connected the single-chain variable fragment of the broadly neutralizing HIV-1-specific antibody VRC01 to a third-generation CAR moiety as the extracellular and intracellular domains and subsequently transduced this into primary CD8"
8819,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 regulatory protein Vpr has been detected in the serum of HIV-seropositive individuals and in the cerebrospinal fluid of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients suffering from neurological disorders. Therefore, Vpr could play a critical role in the neuronal apoptosis observed postmortem in the brain of patients, often connected to a severe AIDS-related disease termed HIV-associated dementia (HAD). This suggests that the Vpr neurotoxicity already observed in vitro on hippocampal neurons could also occur in other brain structures. In this study the authors have investigated the ability of synthetic Vpr to induce apoptosis in primary cultures of rat cortical and striatal neurons. Moreover, the authors have explored the Vpr minimal proapoptotic region using synthetic Vpr fragments and mutants of the protein. Treatments of both neuronal types with Vpr, its C-terminal domain, Vpr(52-96), or a shorter fragment, Vpr(70-96), led to dose- and time-dependent cell death as determined by flow cytometry after propidium iodide labeling, phase-contrast microscopy, and TUNEL labeling. Taken together, these results support an apoptosis-induced death of these neurons. The (71-82) Vpr peptide, previously shown toxic to isolated mitochondria, was inactive on neurons. Vpr-induced neuronal apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase-3 beginning 3 h after Vpr extracellular addition and peaking 3 h later. Moreover, an hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species was observed. In addition to hippocampal neurons, the extension of the apoptotic property of Vpr to cortical and striatal neurons could account for several signs observed in HAD and is thus consistent with a possible involvement of Vpr in this syndrome."
8380,0.005,1.0000,"The effect of antiretroviral therapy on the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated genital lesions was evaluated in 201 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women who were followed-up for 1-6 years. Gynecologic examinations were performed every 6-12 months. HPV sequences in cervico-vaginal cells, analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and typed by restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis, were repeatedly detected in 126 women; 29 had transient HPV infection. Genital lesions were found in 137 patients; prevalence was comparable in women who were receiving different antiretroviral regimens. Regression of low-grade lesions was more prevalent among patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy than among those receiving other regimens; high-grade lesions regressed in the majority of cases, regardless of antiretroviral therapy. HPV infection persisted in nearly 80% of the cases. In conclusion, our data show that antiretroviral therapy does not prevent the development of HPV-associated lesions and does not eliminate HPV infection; therefore, early and strict gynecologic follow-up of HIV-infected women is warranted."
8806,0.005,1.0000,"This study focused on dietary glycemic index because insulin resistance can be important in the pathogenesis of fat deposition in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We evaluated differences in past dietary glycemic intake between men with HIV who developed fat deposition and those who did not. This was a nested case-control study consisting of 37 cases and 37 controls from the Nutrition for Healthy Living cohort. Food records from 6 to 24 months prior to development of fat deposition in cases were analyzed and compared with controls. Cases were defined as men with a waist-to-hip ratio >0.95 and body mass index (calculated as kg/m(2)) between 23 and 26. Controls were matched by age, race, body mass index, highly active antiretroviral therapy use, and CD4 count. Food records were analyzed using t tests for normally distributed nutrients and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for nutrients with skewed distributions. Glycemic index was calculated for each meal and day. There was no significant difference in glycemic index for meals and day between participants with or without fat deposition. Both groups had a moderate dietary glycemic index intake. This study showed no association between dietary glycemic index and development of fat deposition in HIV. Instead, results of this study depict the potential benefits associated with eating high-quality diets, primarily adequate fiber and protein intake. Diet can be important in preventing development of fat deposition in patients with HIV."
1797,0.005,1.0000,"The new antiviral agent, azidothymidine (AZT; BW A509U), is currently the only successful drug in use for patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The effect of this thymidine analog, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, on the replication of the lymphadenopathy-associated virus strain of the human immunodeficiency virus was evaluated by using susceptible H9 and Jurkat cells. Cells were pretreated with concentrations of drug ranging from 0.5 to 100 microM, infected, and maintained in medium containing drug. Virus production was assayed by reverse transcriptase assays, and virus-specific DNA was analyzed by Southern blots probed with cloned human immunodeficiency virus sequences. At 4 to 8 days postinfection, infected cells without drug reached a peak of reverse transcriptase activity that was sustained. Increasing concentrations of AZT caused increasing delays in virus production; however, replicate cultures at nontoxic levels of the drug (up to 25 microM) eventually produced as much virus as did non-drug-treated infected cells, despite the continued presence of the drug. Levels of intracellular, unintegrated, virus-specific DNA paralleled reverse transcriptase levels. Virus-caused cytopathic effect was likewise delayed in drug-treated cultures. Virus recovered from H9 cultures after 25 microM AZT treatment did not appear resistant to AZT."

The Kaplan-Meier method estimated viral rebound in 42.5% of patients by 24 weeks and in 64.3% by 84 weeks. Risk of viral rebound was independently associated with baseline and changes from baseline CD4 cell count. The achieved CD4 cell count was the most important factor for prediction of viral rebound (relative hazard, 5.4 for an updated CD4 cell count of <20 vs. >500 copies/mL; P=.0001). Baseline virus load was not associated with virus load rebound. Lower baseline CD4 cell counts were associated with increased risk of viral rebound; however, this risk was significantly reduced in persons with low baseline CD4 cell counts who experienced substantial increases in CD4 cell counts during follow-up."
4855,0.005,1.0000,"Data on baseline hepatic function of HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infected patients are limited in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed liver function test (LFT) abnormalities in Nigerian patients with HIV/HBV co-infection to highlight the impact of HIV on HBV-related liver disease in sub-Saharan Africa. A cross-sectional study involving 100 HIV/HBV co-infected patients and 100 age- and sex-matched HBV mono-infected controls. Blood testing for HIV antibodies, CD4+ cell count, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), LFTs, platelet count, fasting blood glucose and lipid profile were carried out. Non-invasive hepatic fibrosis scores (aspartate aminotransferase-platelet ratio index [APRI] and FIB-4) were also calculated. Co-infected patients had deranged liver enzymes more than the controls (77% versus 64%, P = 0.04). The predominant patterns of enzyme derangement in co-infected patients were either predominantly ↑ALP (30% versus 4%, P < 0.0001) or mixed (30% versus 15%, P = 0.01) but predominantly ↑AST/ALT in the controls (25% versus 9%, P = 0.003). Co-infected patients had higher fibrosis scores for both APRI (P = 0.002) and FIB-4 (P = 0.0001). On further analysis, LFT abnormalities and fibrosis scores were only significantly higher in co-infected patients in the immune clearance and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis phases. LFT abnormalities are common in Nigerians with HBV infection and co-infection with HIV negatively impacts on hepatic function."
7572,0.005,1.0000,"Psychiatric disorders are common among people living with HIV in Nigeria. Adherence is necessary to optimise the outcome of antiretroviral therapy. In this study, we aimed to identify associations between antiretroviral adherence, measured by one-week and one-month self-reported missed doses, and psychiatric illness in a cohort previously assessed for psychiatric disorders using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The study participants comprised 151 adults with major depression, anxiety or suicidal symptoms, and 302 matched-control participants. Two controls were randomly selected for each case within the same gender and education level. We compared participants with psychiatric disorders (WPDs) and no psychiatric disorders (NPDs) on selected demographic and clinical variables, in addition to adherence. Participants with one or more missed doses in the preceding month had twice the odds of having a major depressive episode as those with no missed doses during this period (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.03, 4.79). This association remained significant after adjusting for selected risk factors. There was no statistically significant difference between WPD and NPD groups on either one-week or one-month adherence, or on age, marital status, occupational class, HIV viral load at enrolment or current CD4 cell count. Among Nigerian adults with HIV, suboptimal antiretroviral adherence is associated with, and could be a sign of, depression. Routine self-report adherence assessments may potentially be utilised in identifying individuals at risk among this population."
1862,0.005,1.0000,"Two methods are presented for measuring population effectiveness (i.e., reduction of disease in a population in which only some receive treatment) of antiretroviral therapy among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men at risk for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and followed between January 1, 1986, and June 30, 1999, in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Method I, requiring use of a seroincident cohort, estimates relative hazards of AIDS for persons at equal duration of infection. Method II, allowing use of a seroprevalent cohort, estimates relative hazards since the beginning of therapy eras for persons starting at equal levels of prognostic markers of disease stage (CD4 cell count and HIV type 1 RNA). The follow-up interval was divided into four calendar periods to characterize different eras of antiretroviral therapy. For method I, the relative hazards were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93, 2.49), 0.91 (95% CI: 0.66, 1.26), and 0.30 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.51) for the eras of no therapy, dual nucleoside therapy, and potent combination antiretroviral therapy, respectively (monotherapy was the reference era). For method II, the corresponding relative hazards were 1.52 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.38), and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.45).

A competitor DNA was constructed from a conserved region of the HIV-1 gag gene by deleting a sequence of 18 base pairs. We quantitated HIV-1 proviral DNA copy number in clinical samples. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 35 HIV-infected patients with a CD4 count range of 4-728 cell/mm3 were analyzed by this method.

Paired serum and saliva samples were collected from 59 HIV-HCV coinfected patients. HCV RNA was detected by nested-PCR, using primers derived from the 5' non-coding region of HCV, and positive results were quantified using the b-DNA method. HCV RNA was detected in the saliva of 22/59 (37.3%) patients, with a mean level of 1.15 x 10(6) genome equivalents/ml; there was no correlation of salivary positivity with immune status (CD4 cell count), age or HIV risk group, but there was with gender (19/38 [50%] positive results in male, compared to 3/21 [14.3%] in female, P = 0.007). HCV RNA was detected in the serum of 45/59 (76.3%) patients at a higher level (mean of 2.52 x 10(7) genome equivalents/ml) compared to saliva. Positivity was not correlated with age, gender or CD4 + cell count. There was a correlation between qualitative saliva and serum results (P = 0.003), but not between quantifications (P = 0.57). This first study reporting significant amounts of HCV RNA in saliva could have important implications for HCV epidemiology."

This study aimed to determine the relationship between public perception about HIV/AIDS and discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA . The present study was conducted using a descriptive and survey design. Data were collected from 450 patients (236 male and 214 female) in Tehran and Yazd cities. The research instruments were modified HIV-related knowledge/attitude and perception questions about PLWHA, and discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA. The results showed that prevalence of discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA in the studied population was 60.0%. There was a significant negative correlation between citizens' awareness about HIV/AIDS, HIV-related attitudes, negative perception toward people with HIV/AIDS symptoms and their discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA (p < .01). The hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that components of public perception about HIV/AIDS explained for 23.7% of the variance of discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA. Negative public perceptions about HIV/AIDS in Iran associated with discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA and cultural beliefs in Iran tend to stigmatize and discriminate against the LWHA. "

We conducted a cross-sectional national multicenter study among 2,475 patients in 26 randomly selected mental health institutions throughout Brazil. We used Item Response Theory to standardize knowledge scores and multilevel multiple linear regression to determine the effect of individual and treatment setting characteristics on standardized knowledge score. Schizophrenia was the main diagnosis (48%) of participants. Mean knowledge score was 6.78 (range 1-10). Treatment setting characteristics were not associated with knowledge scores. Higher HIV/AIDS knowledge scores were significantly associated with a history of sexually transmitted disease (STD), previous HIV testing and consistent condom use; lower HIV/AIDS knowledge scores were significantly associated with specific sociodemographic, psychiatric, and HIV risk-perception factors. Psychiatric patients in Brazil lag behind the general population with knowledge scores comparable to those of nearly a decade ago. The mental health system in Brazil and elsewhere must consider strategies beyond dispensing information, for preventing HIV/AIDS transmission in the psychiatric population."

Despite better knowledge about mode of transmission and methods of prevention including use of active immunization, it still remains a threat. In this study, a questionnaire survey of Nigerian surgeons was conducted to ascertain their knowledge, and immunization status against HBV infection. Our study showed a 9.3% incidence of clinical HBV infection, poor perception of risk of infection, poor local availability of vaccines, and low uptake where same was available. Reasons cited for non-immunization are lack of awareness, cost, inertia and non-availability of vaccines. Only 10.2% of our respondents always used barrier methods, and 77.7% of our respondents do not check the immune status of their patients after sustaining an intraoperative sharp injury. The overall level of knowledge about HBV infection was deemed poor. We conclude with recommendations on how to improve knowledge about HBV infection and uptake of vaccines."

The aim of this observational study was to characterize the RPV pharmacokinetic profile, to quantify interpatient variability, and to identify potential factors that could influence drug exposure. RPV concentration data were collected from HIV-infected patients as part of routine therapeutic drug monitoring performed in our center (Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology). A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with NONMEM by comparing various structural models. The influence of demographic and clinical covariates, as well as frequent genetic polymorphisms in 5 genes (CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*17, UGT1A1*28, and UGT1A4*2), on RPV elimination was explored. A total of 325 plasma concentration measurements were obtained from 249 HIV-positive patients. Plasma concentrations ranged from 12 to 255 ng/ml. A one-compartment model with zero-order absorption best characterized RPV pharmacokinetics. The average RPV clearance (CL) was 11.7 liters/h, the average volume of distribution was 401 liters, and the mean absorption time was 4 h. The interinterindividual variability (IIV) for CL was estimated to be 33%. None of the available demographic or genetic covariates showed any influence on RPV pharmacokinetics, but 29% of the patients were predicted to present minimal concentrations below the recently identified target cutoff value of 50 ng/ml. The variability in RPV pharmacokinetics appears to be lower than that for most other antiretroviral drugs. However, under the standard regimen of 25 mg daily, a significant number of patients might be underdosed. It remains to be investigated whether the underexposure has an impact on the development of resistance while patients are on maintenance therapy."

Hence, patients with well-controlled HIV infection are no longer prevented from receiving transplants, but treatment must be based on knowledge of pharmacokinetics for the drugs involved. The common approach measuring the cyclosporine level after 2 h or trough level is misleading and it was necessary to determine the area under the curve."
6760,0.005,1.0000,"The objective was to determine whether there is an association between carriage of oral yeasts, malnutrition and HIV-1 infection among Tanzanian children. A case-control study design within a cross-sectional study was used, and the outcome was carriage of oral yeasts. The exposure variables were malnutrition and HIV-1 antibody, and confounders to be adjusted for were age, sex, and breastfeeding. The study was carried out in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, in two maternal and child health (MCH) clinics that offer routine medical checkups to all expectant mothers and children aged between 0 and 5 years in the catchment area. A total of 882 children aged between 18 months and 5 years participated. Smears from the tongue and buccal mucosa were examined for oral yeasts. Malnutrition was categorized according to standards on the MCH chart and World Health Organization/Centers for Disease Control (WHO/CDC) standards as weight-for-height (wasted), weight-for-age (underweight), and height-for-age (stunted). HIV-1 infection was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reactive sera were confirmed by Western Blot. About 27% of the children were slightly or severely malnourished according to standards on the MCH chart. According to WHO/CDC standards, 2.6% were wasted, 16.3% were underweight, and 29.6% were stunted. Fourteen (1.6%) were seropositive for HIV-1 antibody. Hyphal forms and blastospores were much more frequent among children infected with HIV-1 with odds ratios ranging from 3.8 (95% CI: 1.3;11.2) to 6.2 (95% CI: 2.1;18.4) depending on categorization of malnutrition. Malnutrition was a risk factor, too, albeit to a much lesser and insignificant degree. The study supports our previous findings that malnutrition may predispose to carriage of oral yeasts and subsequent infection. However, in this study population HIV infection was clearly the predominant risk factor."
2982,0.005,1.0000,"There is accumulating evidence from clinical trials and cohort studies that highly active antiretroviral combination therapy is effective at halting immunologic and clinical progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Its impact at a population level is less well known because the regimes may be difficult to tolerate and compliance poorer. The authors make use of population data for almost all of the HIV-infected people in Scotland in 1997 who were under clinical care and monitor their response to therapy during the first year when these effective treatments became widely available. More than two thirds of the HIV-positive patients were on some form of antiretroviral therapy during the year. The authors show that all treated groups, even those who were on changing regimes, showed net improvement in immunologic status during the year. For the group of patients on triple or quadruple therapy, there was an average increase of more than 100 CD4 cells/mm(3) over the year, with other treatment groups showing more modest, but significant, increases."

Outcomes in the current management era are unknown. This is a prospective series of liver or kidney transplant recipients with stable HIV disease. Eleven liver and 18 kidney transplant recipients were followed for a median of 3.4 years (IQR [interquartile range] 2.9-4.9). One- and 3-year liver recipients' survival was 91% and 64%, respectively; kidney recipients' survival was 94%. One- and 3-year liver graft survival was 82% and 64%, respectively; kidney graft survival was 83%. Kidney patient and graft survival were similar to the general transplant population, while liver survival was similar to the older population, based on 1999-2004 transplants in the national database. CD4+ T-cell counts and HIV RNA levels were stable; and there were two opportunistic infections (OI). The 1- and 3-year cumulative incidence (95% confidence intervals [CI]) of rejection episodes for kidney recipients was 52% (28-75%) and 70% (48-92%), respectively. Two-thirds of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients, but no patient with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, recurred. Good transplant and HIV-related outcomes among kidney transplant recipients, and reasonable outcomes among liver recipients suggest that transplantation is an option for selected HIV-infected patients cared for at centers with adequate expertise."

This study aimed to determine the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease using the Framingham risk score among HIV-infected patients from three regions of Brazil. This is a pooled analysis of three cohort studies, which enrolled 3,829 individuals, 59% were men, 66% had white skin color, and mean age 39.0 ± 9.9 years. Comparisons among regions showed that there were marked differences in demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, and HIV-related characteristics. Prevalence of Framingham score ≥10 was 4.5% in the Southern, 4.2% in the Midwest, and 3.9% in the Northeast of Brazil. The Framingham score ≥10 was similar between regions for males, patients aged ≥60 years, with obesity, central obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Women were three times more likely to have coronary heart disease in 10 years than men. Hypertension and diabetes increased more than four times the risk of coronary heart disease, followed by central obesity, obesity, and prehypertension. The use of antiretroviral agents and time since HIV diagnosis were not risk factors for coronary artery disease in 10 years. In conclusion, hypertension and diabetes are the strongest independent predictors of 10-year risk of coronary heart disease among HIV-infected population."
2671,0.005,1.0000,"Individuals repeatedly exposed to HIV, but who remain uninfected, form a population enriched for persons likely to have either natural or acquired resistance to the virus. We have studied four such exposed uninfected cohorts, representing 60 individuals, for evidence of protective immunity. This population included participants exposed to HIV through anal or vaginal receptive intercourse on multiple occasions over many years. We observed CD8(+)-cell noncytotoxic inhibition of HIV replication in acutely infected CD4(+) cells in the vast majority of individuals most recently exposed to the virus (within 1 year). The levels of this CD8(+)-cell response were sufficient to inhibit the in vitro infection of the exposed subjects' peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We found no evidence of a significant role for CCR5 Delta32 mutation in this population, nor did CD4(+) cell susceptibility to infection or HIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes correlate with resistance to infection in the individuals tested. Therefore, the observed strong noncytotoxic CD8(+)-cell anti-HIV responses may be an antiviral immune activity contributing to the apparent protection from infection in these exposed uninfected individuals."
6051,0.005,1.0000,"A metabolic syndrome has been described among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy; the syndrome is characterized by fat redistribution, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. We compared the 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk estimates for 91 HIV-infected men and women with fat redistribution with the risk estimates for 273 age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched subjects enrolled in the Framingham Offspring Study. Thirty HIV-infected patients without fat redistribution were also compared with 90 age- and BMI-matched control subjects. The 10-year CHD risk estimate was significantly elevated among HIV-infected patients with fat redistribution, particularly among men; however, when they were matched with control subjects by waist-to-hip ratio, the 10-year CHD risk estimate did not significantly differ between groups. HIV-infected patients without fat redistribution did not have a greater CHD risk estimate than did control subjects. In addition, the CHD risk estimate was greatest in HIV-infected patients who had primary lipoatrophy, compared with those who had either lipohypertrophy or mixed fat redistribution. Therefore, although CHD risk is increased in HIV-infected patients with fat redistribution, the pattern of fat distribution and sex are potential important components in determining the risk in this population."

A total of 389 whites and 135 nonwhites started receiving HAART before 1 April 2001. After 1 year of treatment, 78% of nonwhites and 76% of whites achieved a virus load of <500 HIV RNA copies/mL. No major differences were found between the 2 groups with respect to achievement of a virus load of <500 copies/mL (relative risk [RR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-1.18), risk of clinical progression (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.32-1.24), or response measured by total CD4+ cell count. One year after fulfilling Danish recommendations for initiation of HAART, 91% of nonwhites and 93% of whites had started receiving HAART.

This mutation is also detectable in circulating cell-free DNA from the plasma of HCC patients and healthy subjects in these regions. We have examined the joint effect of plasma 249(ser) and HBV infection in a case-control study design involving 348 control, 98 cirrhotic, and 186 HCC participants from The Gambia, West Africa, an area of high HCC incidence. The 249(ser) mutation was detected in 3.5% of controls, 15.3% of cirrhotics, and 39.8% of HCC cases (adjusted odds ratios (OR): 4.83, (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71-13.7) for cirrhosis and 20.3 (8.19-50.0) for HCC). HBsAg positivity along with plasma 249(ser) was observed in 45/183 (24.6%) HCC cases compared to only one (0.3%) control. Risk for HCC was associated with markers of HBV alone (OR: 10.0, 95% CI: 5.16-19.6), 249(ser) alone (OR: 13.2, 95% CI: 4.99-35.0), and both markers present (OR: 399, 95% CI: 48.6-3270). These results suggest a multiplicative effect on HCC risk resulting from the mutational effect of aflatoxin on TP53, as monitored by detection of plasma 249(ser), with concomitant chronic infection with HBV."
2719,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is known to show significant genetic diversity. There are eight HBV genotypes (A-H) characterized by distinct geographical distribution. Mutations in the HBV genome, in particular precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutations, may be important factors in the pathogenesis of disease. In this study genetic heterogeneity and phylogenetic analysis of HBV isolates from 32 naïve patients with acute HBV infection was investigated. Eleven patients presented with severe infection, while the remaining 21 had self-limiting illness. Only four isolates from patients with severe HBV infection harbored the G1896A stop codon mutation. One isolate (Irish-13), collected from a patient with acute asymptomatic infection, had a G1896A mutation and a 243 bp deletion of the polymerase gene. A triple mutation, T1753C/A1762T/G1764A was identified in only one isolate (Irish-3) associated with severe infection. The latter also had a mutation, A2339G, in the core gene, not previously reported in severe acute infection caused by genotype D. Variations within the S gene were identified in 6 isolates, including Gly145Ala, associated with vaccine immune escape, Asp144Glu, Ser143Leu and Phe134Leu, each associated with failure to detect HBsAg. Phylogenetic analysis was determined using amplicons of the S gene (678 bp) and distal-X/PC region (672 bp). Genotype A was the most common (75%), followed by genotype D (15.6%), and equal proportions of C, E, F, and H. A novel recombinant of genotypes D and E was identified in an isolate originating from West Africa. Genetic heterogeneity of HBV isolates of HBV isolates from patients with acute infection needs further study of its significance."

The virologic differences among HBV genotype, precore and basal core promoter (BCP) mutations were investigated. HBV strains were isolated from 18 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients (nine genotype B and nine genotype C). All had precore and BCP wild-type sequences. After cloning of full-length HBV genome, the effects of viral genotype, precore and BCP mutations singly or additively on the expression of viral DNA and antigens were investigated by mutagenesis and transfection assays in Huh7 cells. Significant findings included the following: (i) expression of intracellular core protein increased when precore or BCP mutation was introduced in genotype C strains; (ii) expression of intracellular surface protein was lower in genotype C precore wild-type strain compared with genotype B; (iii) precore mutation was associated with a lower extracellular expression level of HBV DNA; (iv) secretion of hepatitis B surface antigen in genotype C was lower than that in genotype B; and (v) secretion of HBeAg in genotype B was lower than that in genotype C. No additive effect was observed by combining precore and BCP mutations. Hence, HBV genotype and precore/BCP mutations correlate with intrahepatic expression of viral antigens in vitro."
7469,0.005,1.0000,"Molecular mechanisms related to occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, particularly those based on genotype C infection, have rarely been determined thus far in the ongoing efforts to determine infection mechanisms. Therefore, we aim to elucidate the mutation patterns in the surface open reading frame (S ORF) underlying occult infections of HBV genotype C in the present study. Nested PCRs were applied to 624 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative Korean subjects. Cloning and sequencing of the S ORF gene was applied to 41 occult cases and 40 control chronic carriers. Forty-one (6.6%) of the 624 Korean adults with HBsAg-negative serostatus were found to be positive for DNA according to nested PCR tests. Mutation frequencies in the three regions labeled here as preS1, preS2, and S were significantly higher in the occult subjects compared to the carriers in all cases. A total of two types of deletions, preS1 deletions in the start codon and preS2 deletions as well as nine types of point mutations were significantly implicated in the occult infection cases. Mutations within the ""a"" determinant region in HBsAg were found more frequently in the occult subjects than in the carriers. Mutations leading to premature termination of S ORF were found in 16 occult subjects (39.0%) but only in one subject from among the carriers (2.5%). In conclusion, our data suggest that preS deletions, the premature termination of S ORF, and ""a"" determinant mutations are associated with occult infections of HBV genotype C among a HBsAg-negative population. The novel mutation patterns related to occult infection introduced in the present study can help to broaden our understanding of HBV occult infections."

This work was carried out to evaluate T-helper 1/T-helper 2 (Th1/Th2) cytokine profiles in patients with occult HCV infection versus chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection, also to investigate any association between theses cytokines and liver histological features in both groups. Serum levels of Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IFN-gamma) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) were measured in 35 patients with occult HCV infection compared to 50 patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and 30 healthy controls. We have found that Th1 cytokines were significantly increased in patients with CHC infection than in both occult HCV infection and control groups (p less than 0.001). On the other hand, serum IL-4 levels were higher in occult HCV infection than in CHC and control groups (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, serum IL-10 levels were higher in both patient groups vs control group (pless than 0.001), with no significant difference between CHC and occult HCV groups. Finally, only serum IL-10 levels were significantly higher among patients with high activity (A2-A3) than those with low activity (A0-A1) in both CHC and occult HCV groups (p=0.038, p=0.025, respectively). Patients with occult HCV infection exhibited a distinct immunoregulatory cytokine pattern that is shifted towards the Th2 arm. "

However, the relationship between immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and occult HCV, characterized by the presence of HCV-RNA in liver or in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the absence of serological markers, is unknown. We tested this in 113 anti-HCV-negative patients; 87 with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and 26 controls with hereditary glomerular nephropathies. All patients were serum HCV-RNA negative by conventional real-time PCR. Significantly, occult HCV-RNA (detectable viral RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in serum after ultracentrifugation) was found in 34 of 87 patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis versus 1 of 26 control patients. The serum creatinine levels were significantly higher in patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis with than in those without occult HCV (1.5 versus 1.1 mg/dl, respectively). A multivariate analysis adjusted for gender showed a significantly increased risk of occult HCV in patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis versus the controls (odds ratio of 13.29). Progression to end-stage renal disease tended to be faster in patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and occult HCV than in the negative cases. Thus, occult HCV is strongly associated with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and may have a role in the progression of the disease."

Study subjects were divided into unvaccinated cohorts (born before 1984) and vaccinated cohorts (born after 1984). HBV-DNA positivity was determined by positivity of nested polymerase chain reaction in at least two of three regions (pre-S, S, and pre-core/core genes). OBI frequency was lower in vaccinated than unvaccinated antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc)-negative subjects (0 of 392 [0%] vs. 4 of 218 [1.8%]; P = 0.007), tended to be higher in vaccinated than unvaccinated anti-HBc-positive subjects (16 of 334 [4.8%] vs. 3 of 181 [1.7%]; P = 0.072), and was higher in vaccinated than unvaccinated subjects seropositive for both antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and anti-HBc (13 of 233 [5.6%] vs. 3 of 170 [1.8%]; P = 0.025). By using known anti-HBc seropositivity rate in children in our serosurveys, the estimated OBI frequency per 10(4) HBsAg-negative subjects declined from 160.7 in unvaccinated cohorts to 11.5 in vaccinated cohorts. In vaccinated cohorts, OBI frequency was higher in anti-HBc-positive subjects than in anti-HBc-negative subjects (16 of 334 [4.8%] vs. 0 of 392 [0%]; P < 0.001).

4739,0.005,1.0000,"Development of a microbicide that prevents rectal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a vital component in reducing HIV spread. We recently demonstrated that a formulation of the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) MIV-150 in carrageenan reduced vaginal infection of macaques with simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239 with HIV-1(HxB2) reverse transcriptase (SHIV-RT). Herein, we performed the first testing of MIV-150-carrageenan against rectal infection. Rhesus macaques were treated rectally with MIV-150-carrageenan or methyl cellulose (MC) placebo gel up to 4 h prior to rectal challenge with 10³ or 10(4) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID₅₀) of SHIV-RT. Infection was assessed by measuring plasma virus RNA as well as T and B cell responses. MIV-150-carrageenan protected all animals challenged with 10³ TCID(₅₀ when gel was applied either 30 min or 4 h prior to challenge, while 100% of the MC-treated animals became infected (n = 4 each; P < 0.03). Partial protection (2 of 4 animals) by MIV-150-carrageenan was observed for rectal challenge with 10-fold more virus applied 4 h after the gel. Sequencing of the RT gene from plasma virus RNA isolated at peak viremia confirmed that both of these animals (like infected MC controls) were infected with wild-type virus. Infection correlated with the development of SIV-specific T and B cell responses. MIV-150 was detected in the rectal fluids and tissues 4 h after gel application but was not detected in the blood at any time (0.5 to 24 h). These data are promising for the development of NNRTI-containing gels to prevent rectal HIV transmission."

Here, we describe the presence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and HIV variants in the HIV-infected adult population in El Salvador. Dried blood spots from 119 HIV-infected antiretroviral-naive adults attended in El Salvador were collected in 2011. The TDR was assessed according to the list recommended by the WHO. HIV-1 variants were described using phylogeny. Pol sequences could be amplified in 88 patients (50.6% men), with a mean age of 35 years. Almost all (96.7%) were infected with HIV through sexual practice and 58.7% were recently diagnosed. The mean CD4(+) count was 474 cells/mm(3) and 43.1% and 15.5% of patients showed moderate (<500 CD4 cells) or severe (<200) immune suppression, respectively. HIV-1 viral load was >100 000 copies/mL in 24.7% of patients and <2000 copies/mL in 9.1%. Five samples (5.7%) harboured any TDR mutation: 2.3% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), and 1.4% for protease inhibitor (PI). All showed only one TDR single-class resistance mutation: M184I (two cases) for NRTI, K101E and K103N for NNRTI and L23I for PI. All viruses excepting one (URF_BG) belonged to subtype B. No phylogenetic TDR networks were found. In conclusion, we report a TDR prevalence of 5.7% in El Salvador, lower than in other Central American studies. Periodical studies are essential to monitor and prevent TDR emergence in low-income and middle-income regions. Also, more efforts are needed to promote early diagnosis and prevention of infection in El Salvador."

We have addressed infection factors such as cell purity, source, culture methods, and activation states as well as virus variant and detection methods to conclusively determine the outcome of trophoblast challenge by free virus. Pure (> 99.98%) populations of trophoblasts from 11 different placentas were challenged at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) as high as 6 with five different HIV-1 variants, three of which are non-syncytium-forming, macrophage-tropic isolates from infected infants, with and without coinfection with cytomegalovirus; these preparations were monitored for productive infection for up to 3 weeks after challenge by five different criteria, the most sensitive of which were cocultivation with target cells that can detect virus at an MOI of 10(-7) and HIV DNA PCR that detects 30 virus copies per 10(5) cells. Infection was never detected. However, molecularly cloned T-cell (pNL4-3)- and macrophage (pNLAD8)-tropic provirus plasmids, when transfected into primary trophoblasts, yielded productive infections, indicating that trophoblasts do not suppress late-stage virus replication and assembly. Because of the purity of the trophoblast preparations, the extended length of the infection culture period, the number of trophoblast preparations and virus types examined, the sensitivity of the bioassays and molecular detection assays, and the observations that trophoblasts can support virus replication from provirus, the results of this study strongly argue that free virus cannot infect primary villous trophoblasts."
3130,0.005,1.0000,"A DNA vaccination regime was investigated previously in rhesus macaques using a full-genome human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) plasmid, which, due to mutations in the nucleocapsid (NC) proteins, produced only non-infectious HIV-1 particles (Akahata et al., Virology 275, 116-124, 2000). In that study, four monkeys were injected intramuscularly 14 times with the plasmid. All of them showed immunological responses against HIV-1 and partial protection from challenge with a simian immunodeficiency virus/HIV (SHIV) chimeric virus. To improve this DNA vaccination regime, the plasmid used for vaccination was changed. In the present study, four macaques were injected intramuscularly eight times with a full-genome SHIV plasmid that produces non-infectious SHIV particles. CTL activities were higher than those observed in monkeys vaccinated previously with the HIV-1 plasmid. In all macaques vaccinated, peak plasma virus loads after homologous challenge with SHIV were two to three orders of magnitude lower than those of the naive controls, and virus loads fell below the level of detection at 6 weeks post-challenge. This suggested that the vaccination regime in this study was partially effective and better than the previous regime."

We report here systematic design and characterization of 28 novel TALENs targeting multiple regions of CCR5 gene (CCR5-TALEN) which encodes the co-receptor critical for entry of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). By systemic characterization of these CCR5-TALENs, we have identified one (CCR5-TALEN-515) with higher nuclease activity, specificity, and lower cytotoxicity compared with zinc-finger nuclease (CCR5-ZFN) currently undergoing clinical trials. Sequence analysis of target cell line GHOST-CCR5-CXCR4 and human primary CD4 T cells showed that the double-strand breaks at the TALEN targeted sites resulted in truncated or nonfunctional CCR5 proteins thereby conferring protection against HIV-1 infection in vitro. None of the CCR5-TALENs had detectable levels of off-target nuclease activity against the homologous region in CCR2 although substantial level was identified for CCR5-ZFN in the primary CD4 T cells. Our results suggest that the CCR5-TALENs identified here are highly functional nucleases that produce protective genetic alterations to human CCR5. Application of these TALENs directly to the primary CD4 T cells and CD34 hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of infected individuals could help to create an immune system resistant to HIV-1 infection, recapitulating the success of ""Berlin patient"" and serving as an essential first step towards a ""functional"" cure of AIDS."

During neutrophil activation in response to various agonists, the cytosolic subunits translocate to and associate with the cytochrome b558, a process that results in oxidase activation.

Expression of granzyme B mRNA is altered in HIV-1 infected patients. Significantly fewer HIV patients had detectable granzyme B mRNA levels than controls. The one HIV-infected patient with detectable granzyme B mRNA displayed a much higher level of this mRNA than all healthy controls.

Thirty-one subjects had enteric infections; all but one had AIDS. Alteration in bowel habits was the most common symptom and occurred independently of enteric infections. Abnormal histopathology was present in 69% of cases, and the finding was associated with altered bowel habits. An HIV-associated protein, p24, was detected in 71% of biopsies by ELISA assay. Tissue p24 contents varied with disease stage and were highest in HIV-infected individuals without AIDS (Walter Reed classes 3 and 4). Tissue p24 detection was associated with both altered bowel habits and histologic mucosal abnormalities. Tissue contents of the cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta, were higher in HIV-infected individuals than in controls and their elevations were independent of enteric infection. We conclude that HIV reactivation in the intestinal mucosa may be associated with an inflammatory bowel syndrome in the absence of other enteric pathogens."

6542,0.005,1.0000,"We analyzed immune responses in chronically HIV-infected individuals who took part in a treatment interruption (TI) trial designed for patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy within 6 months of seroconversion. In the 2 subjects who exhibited the best viral control, we detected CD8(+) T-cell responses against 1-2 Gag epitopes during the early weeks of TI and a subsequent increase in the number of epitopes recognized by the later time points. Each of these subjects developed mutations within the epitopes targeted by the highest magnitude responses. In the subject with the worst viral control, we detected responses against 2 Gag epitopes throughout the entire TI and no Gag mutations. The magnitude of these responses increased dramatically with time, greatly exceeding those detected in the virologic controllers. The highest levels of contemporaneous autologous neutralizing antibody activity were detected in the virologic controllers, and a subsequent escape mutation developed within the envelope gene of one controller that abrogated the response. These data suggest that immune escape mutations are a sign of viral control during TI, and that the absence of immune escape mutations in the presence of high levels of viral replication indicates the lack of an effective host immune response."

There was no significant difference in the ages of the African-born and non-African patients in the HIV clinic. African-born patients were more likely to be women compared with non-African patients (p < 0.001). Forty-three percent of the African-born patients presented with AIDS as defined by CD4(+) T cell counts less than 200 cells per milliliter compared to 33% of antiretroviral naïve non-African HIV patients in the clinic (p < 0.001). Most patients were infected through heterosexual contact and only 4% were diagnosed as a result of routine testing. Seven known HIV subtypes and four unique recombinant forms were identified. The most common opportunistic infection was pulmonary tuberculosis. African immigrants with HIV appear to: (1) access care at later stages of HIV disease than other patients in our clinic; (2) are often infected with non-B subtypes; (3) do not routinely get tested for HIV. Increased awareness to this growing trend is needed for health care providers and public health officials to tailor educational programs and prevention efforts for African immigrants in the United States.
4101,0.005,1.0000,"In a retrospective study of 86 patients with AIDS-defining diseases diagnosed from 1997 to June 2000, i.e. following consolidated and large-scale introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and 342 control patients diagnosed with AIDS from 1985 to 1995, i.e. the decade preceding the HAART era, the etiological spectrum and the related level of immunodeficiency of each individual AIDS-defining opportunistic infection were compared. The results show that, despite the progress attained in the management of HIV infection since the introduction of HAART, clinicians facing newly diagnosed cases of AIDS will likely encounter a spectrum of opportunistic diseases and a level of underlying immunodeficiency similar to those observed during the decade preceding the introduction of HAART. Even in recent years, the large majority of patients newly diagnosed with AIDS have not been able to take advantage of HAART prior to diagnosis of their disease."
8017,0.005,1.0000,"A patient who presented with late stage HIV-associated diseases could not be diagnosed by commercial ELISA tests and a Western blot. However, we could amplify proviral DNA of HIV-1. We found a novel GPGGMI motif in the V3 loop, a novel insertion of a proline in the C3 region, and persistent deletion of two amino acids in the vif gene. The patient had been treated with HAART after diagnosis. Forty months after the first amplification of HIV-1 DNA, anti-HIV-1 antibody was confirmed by ELISA and Western blot and, thus, we amplified and sequenced HIV-1 full sequences. Interestingly, the sequence at the TATAA box was TAAAA, although full sequences were not CRF01_AE. The major differences in the level of the HIV-1 gene between the seronegative and seropositive states were changes at the glycosylation site (NXT) next to the inserted proline and many resistance mutations including M184V to antiretroviral drugs occurred. This is the first report on HIV-1 full sequences isolated from seronegative AIDS patients infected with subtype B in Korea."
7874,0.005,1.0000,"The Caribbean has the highest adult HIV prevalence in the world after sub-Saharan Africa (2011). One sub-population in the Dominican Republic is the migratory Batey community primarily comprised of Haitian immigrants with limited access to healthcare and HIV prevalence rates of between 3.0% and 9.0%, compared to 0.7% nationally. This retrospective cohort study describes the cumulative retention from diagnosis to virological suppression for newly-diagnosed HIV-infected adults presenting to the Clínica de Familia and its Batey programme in La Romana, during 2011. Of the patients diagnosed with HIV, 65% entered into care, 59% completed immunologic testing, 53% were eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, 36% initiated ART within three months of eligibility and 27% were retained in care. Seventeen per cent of those retained on ART with a 12-month viral load measure had undetectable viral load. Attrition primarily occurred before ART initiation. The Batey programme had a first step lost-to-follow-up of 88% compared to 20% at the clinic (p < 0.001). This retrospective study details the continuum of care and indicates where structural changes must occur to increase continuity between steps. The manuscript results are important to help implement programmes to enhance engagement and retention in HIV primary care. "
2686,0.005,1.0000,"Background Being the most backward region, The Far Western Development Region has high illiteracy rate, low socioeconomic status and high migration rate contributing the progression of epidemiological status of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) towards generalized form. Objective To study the demographic profile of the HIV positive patients, along with their CD4 status and tuberculosis during diagnosis. Method A retrospective descriptive study carried out from May 2006 to July 2012 in 271 HIV patients registered in HIV clinic of Mahakali Zonal Hospital, Mahendranagar. Result Among 271 patients enrolled, 48.30% (131) were male and 51.7% (140) were females. Thirty seven (13.7%) were less than 15 years and 76.3% (207) were of age 16-45 years. 38.7% were household workers by occupation and 34.50% were involved in agriculture and 3.70%were migrant labour. At the time of presentation, 22.4% (60) were stage I according to WHO staging and 18.5% (50), 58.5 (158) and 0.7% (2) were of stage II, III and IV respectively. Similarly, 33.0% (89) had more than 350 CD4 count at the time of presentation. 20.8% (56) of patients were infected with tuberculosis. Among 236 families, 2 or more members were found to be affected in 24 families. In most of the cases, female were diagnosed first followed by male in the families, where both the couple were infected. Conclusion Most of the HIV infected patients were of productive age group. Majority of patients were uneducated and Tuberculosis was found to be common opportunistic infections associated with HIV infection."
5912,0.005,1.0000,"Prolonged replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in liver tissues of hepatitis B patients has been considered as an important risk factor for the development of malignancy. Few studies on full-length HBV sequencing in association with the replication efficiency of isolates from HCC tissues have been reported. To study the structural and functional genomics of HBV isolates from Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, full-length HBV genomes were amplified from 6 HBV-marker positive HCC tissues and used to transfect HepG2 cells. Five of 6 isolates showed high replicative efficiency. All isolates were of genotype C and ""hot-spots"" mutations were detected in the B cell and T helper (Th) cell epitopes of the envelope and the core region. In addition, the X region of 2 isolates contained a stop-codon mutation that was predicted to result in a truncated X protein. High replicative HBV immune escape mutants that persist in infected hepatocytes could be 1 of the important factors to initiate pathological processes for the development of HCC in Chinese patients."

This study was conducted to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult and adolescent persons newly diagnosed with HIV presenting at a specialized clinic for sexually transmitted infections (STI). A retrospective analysis of the medical records of adult and adolescent patients newly diagnosed with HIV was undertaken over a 12-month period. The results showed that most patients (64%) were between 20 and 39 years old (age range 14-68 years, M:F ratio 1.4:1). Heterosexual practice was admitted to by 77% of patients. At the time of presentation most patients (53%) were asymptomatic while 24% had some symptoms and 21% had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The most common presentation was generalized lymphadenopathy (67%) which was significantly higher than skin rash (27%), oral candidiasis (24%), cough (24%), weight loss (24%) and pallor of mucous membranes (19%, p < 0.001). This study affirms that young people account for the majority of new cases of HIV infection. The heterosexual route was the predominant mode of transmission. Generalized lymphadenopathy was the commonest presenting feature of persons newly diagnosed with HIV infection."
3429,0.005,1.0000,"In a cohort of 128 human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, we found that patients' knowledge of antiretroviral dosing was suboptimal at regimen initiation but improved with time. Poor medication knowledge 8 weeks after regimen initiation was associated with lower adherence and with a lower level of literacy in a multivariate model (P=.03). Because knowledge deficits are common after antiretroviral regimen initiation, clinicians should assess patients' understanding of medication dosing soon after regimen initiation or change."
5487,0.005,1.0000,"Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) receive numerous medications from multiple providers. As a result, it is important that medication usage is properly documented in each patient's medical record. Lack of adequate documentation may confound a provider's assessment of drug efficacy, potentially leading to an increased incidence of drug interactions and adverse effects. The objective of this study was to determine if discrepancies exist between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record by healthcare providers. Data were obtained using structured telephone surveys and medical chart review. Study participants were recruited from the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center AIDS Clinic. Results obtained for 41 patients demonstrated discrepancies between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record ranging from 9 to 92 percent, depending on the class of drug. The largest differences were observed with the ""as-needed"" class of drugs: benzodiazepines (92 percent), morphine (60 percent), and codeine (56 percent). Differences were also noted for scheduled medications: ketoconazole (54 percent), clotrimazole (45 percent), acyclovir (38 percent), zidovudine (15 percent), and pentamidine (9 percent). These observed discrepancies reaffirm the need for accurate exchange of information between provider and patient to promote the most effective, rational, and safe drug therapy. Careful reviews of medication usage at each visit and use of pharmacy-based medication profiles are potential mechanisms to improve documentation of medication usage in HIV-infected patients."

4806,0.005,1.0000,"Medication adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is currently a topic of major importance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome care. HAART has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV infection. Many people with HIV now live active and productive lives, with the disease itself having minimal impact on their lifespan. Unlike treatment for other chronic diseases, achieving the full benefit of HAART requires an extremely high level of adherence to potent antiretroviral combinations that is often difficult to achieve given the high pill burdens, drug interactions and adverse events associated with treatment. In this paper, the present knowledge regarding antiretroviral medication adherence is summarized with a focus on understanding the importance of adherence, the relationship between adherence and treatment response, the challenges and barriers facing patients trying to achieve optimal adherence, reasons for nonadherence, and the current directions and issues relevant to future adherence research."
1793,0.005,1.0000,"Hematologic manifestations in perinatally human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected children have not been widely described in literature. Knowledge of the spontaneous evolution of this disease is essential for achieving optimum care of patients. We analyzed the main hematologic manifestations developed in the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy period of 1217 children, collected from the Italian Register for HIV infection. In 111 patients, the hematologic sign was the first clinical manifestation. Among anemic and neutropenic patients, the fraction of patients in clinical class C was significantly higher than the corresponding fraction in class B (76%, P<0.001 and 74%, P<0.01), and significantly lower in thrombocytopenic patients (42%, P<0.001). The overall progression from class B to C was overlapping to the control group; when separated, however, anemic patients progressed faster (P<0.0001), whereas thrombocytopenic patients had a slower progression, similar to the nonhematologic patients in class A. Anemic patients had a worse prognosis than the control group (P<0.0001), similar to the nonhematologic patients in class C. Finally, the negative prognostic value of anemia was independent from the immunologic condition. Anemia was associated with greater mortality risks. Thrombocytopenia appeared, paradoxically, to be a positive prognostic factor within class B. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification presently defines hematologic patients as a single entity; a finer distinction could improve its relevance for the rational design of prevention and therapy."

Participants rated the program highly on measures of satisfaction, providing evidence of its acceptability. The effectiveness of the program was assessed in comparisons of the intervention (n = 41) and standard care only (n = 40) groups at baseline and 6-week intervals. Program participants showed significant improvement over comparison group participants on measures of HIV/AIDS and treatment-related knowledge and recognition and understanding of HIV terms. Although there were no significant changes in adherence mastery and behaviors during the 6-week follow up period, there were significant changes in program participants' knowledge about medication adherence. Future steps to examine the sustainability of the program in the medical management of patients are planned in addition to determining its long-range relative impact."

In this study, the genotype frequency of two IL28B SNPs (rs129679860 and rs8099917) in a cohort of chronic HCV-monoinfected patients in Brazil was evaluated and the SNP sufficient to predict the treatment response outcome was determined. A total of 66 naïve genotype-1 chronic HCV-infected patients were genotyped and the associated viral kinetics and SVR were assessed. The overall SVR was 38%. Both the viral kinetics and SVR were associated with rs129679860 genotypes (CC = 62% vs. CT = 33% vs. TT = 18%, p = 0.016). However, rs8099917 genotypes were only associated with SVR (TT = 53% vs. TG = 33% vs. GG = 18%; p = 0.032). In this population, the analysis of a single SNP, rs12979860, successfully predicts SVR in the IFN-RBV treatment of HCV."

8624,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of our study was to determine a minimum threshold CD4 count for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation in HIV-infected patients. A schema using longitudinal data from a clinical cohort was designed. The presenting CD4 counts of asymptomatic HIV-infected patients in Hong Kong were evaluated in relation to their progression to AIDS within 1 year of diagnosis of HIV infection. A graph was generated to depict the changes in the percentage of cumulative AIDS diagnoses for every 10 cell/microL increase in presenting CD4 count. Of 181 patients, 24 had developed AIDS within 1 year of diagnosis of HIV infection. Setting the CD4 count threshold at 150 cells/microL gave a good balance between the number of preventable AIDS-defining events and the number of non-AIDS patients initiating HAART. No extra AIDS-defining events occurred when the CD4 count threshold was reduced from 200 to 150 cells/microL, despite the addition of 13 more patients. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, presenting CD4 count was a significant predictor for AIDS occurrence. The relative hazard for AIDS occurrence of patients with presenting CD4 counts <or=150 cells/microL was 27-fold greater. We suggest a CD4 count of 150 cells/microL as the minimum threshold for HAART initiation in a cohort of Chinese HIV-infected patients. At this level, 20.8% of the AIDS-defining events could be prevented. While a cut-off of 200 cells/microL remains a standard for considering HAART initiation, the minimum threshold signifies a critical moment for timely intervention to be introduced."

The ability of long-term HAART to normalize immune dysregulation in severely immunodeficient HIV-infected patients remains unclear.

7069,0.005,1.0000,"Late presentation remains a major concern despite the dramatically improved prognosis realized by ART. We define a first presentation for HIV care during the course of HIV infection as 'late' if an AIDS-defining opportunistic disease is apparent, or if CD4+ T-cells are <200/microl. In the Western world, approximately 10 and 30% of HIV-infected individuals still present with CD4+ T-cells <50 and <200/microl, respectively; estimates are substantially higher for developing countries. Diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic diseases and intense supportive in-hospital care take precedence over ART. Benefits of starting ART without delay, that is, when opportunistic diseases are still active, include faster resolution of opportunistic diseases and a decreased risk of recurrence. The downside of starting ART without delay could include toxicity, drug interactions and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Among asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic individuals presenting late, where ART and primary prophylaxis are initiated, approximately 10-20% will become symptomatic from drug toxicity or undiagnosed opportunistic complications, including IRIS, which require appropriate therapies. In this review we describe late presentation to HIV care, the scale of the problem, the evaluation of a late-presenting patient and challenges associated with initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the setting of acute opportunistic infections and other comorbidities."
8402,0.005,1.0000,"Clinical observations have demonstrated that excessive chronic alcohol use negatively affects human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and contributes to the liver manifestations of the disease, even in HIV mono-infection. HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection is associated with increased progression of HVC liver disease compared to HCV infection alone, and both of these are negatively affected by alcohol use. Recent data suggest that alcohol use and HIV infection have common targets that contribute to progression of liver disease. Both HIV infection and chronic alcohol use are associated with increased gut permeability and elevated plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide; a central activator of inflammatory responses. Both alcoholic liver disease and HIV infection result in non-specific activation of innate immunity, proinflammatory cytokine cascade upregulation, as well as impaired antigen presenting cell and dendritic cell functions. Finally, alcohol, HIV and antiretroviral therapy affect hepatocyte functions, which contributes to liver damage. The common targets of alcohol and HIV infection in liver disease are discussed in this mini-review."

Three patients survived more than 4 years after LT, 2 having sustained virologic responses to anti-HCV treatment. Another has histologic recurrence not responding to treatment. Hepatitis C virus recurrence can be rapid and aggressive after LT in HIV-coinfected patients. Serial biopsies identify recurrence early, allowing for prompt initiation of treatment."

7640,0.005,1.0000,"Dementia was a frequent consequence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in developed countries before antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available and remains a common neurologic complication of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among patients receiving appropriate therapy. The epidemiology of HIV dementia (HIV-D) in Africa remains unclear 20+ years into the AIDS epidemic. Early studies of cognitive impairment in HIV-positive populations in Africa were limited by vaguely defined criteria for cognitive impairment, inadequate assessment tools lacking ecologic validation, and the absence of normative population data. More recent studies have clarified definitions of impairment, utilized more sophisticated measures, and included normative comparisons. Unfortunately, these detailed neuropsychiatric assessments are not feasible for population-based studies or routine clinical implementation. Therefore, the prevalence data available for HIV-D in Africa represents rates found in people presenting to tertiary care centers and are unlikely to reflect HIV-D rates in the general population. As ART becomes available in Africa, future research efforts must provide a better understanding of the epidemiology of HIV-D, the effects of available ART regimens on HIV-D in this population, and the impact of HIV-D on ART adherence. Universally accepted terminology and criteria for HIV-D are needed. Population-based studies will require the development of neuropsychiatric batteries that can be adapted across a range of African environments. Ideally, these measures will be viable for nonphysician care providers to use as screening tools in the first stage of epidemiologic studies. Such screening tools could also serve as clinical indicators of possible HIV-related cognitive impairment facilitate implementation of ART adherence."

Between July 1997 and December 2001, >/=2 PR and RT samples from 718 persons were sequenced at Stanford University Hospital. Thirty-seven persons had highly divergent sequence pairs characterized by a nucleotide distance of >4.5% in PR or >3.0% in RT. In 16 of 37 sequence pairs, divergence resulted from the loss of mutations during a treatment interruption or from the gain of mutations with reinstitution of treatment. tat and/or gag sequencing of HIV-1 from cryopreserved plasma samples could be performed on 15 of the 21 divergent isolate pairs from persons without a treatment interruption. The sequences of these genes, unaffected by selective drug pressure, were monophyletic. Although HIV-1 PR and RT genes from treated persons may become highly divergent, these changes usually are the result of sequence evolution, rather than superinfection."

Plasma samples from 38 individuals classified as newly infected (seroconversion time <12 months) and twenty four individuals with an established infection (seroconversion time ranging from 3 to 10 years) were analyzed for the presence of mutations by Trugene HIV-1 genotyping assay and Virtual phenotype. Results on the newly infected and the chronically infected individuals showed a limited number of relevant mutations associated with substantial resistance to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. In particular, three patients (4.8%) carried viral major mutations (T69D and M41L) associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors, whereas only one showed the presence of M46L, which is correlated with partial resistance to some protease inhibitors. The clinical interpretation based on different approaches to monitor resistance showed that the Virconet interpretation was less grave than Trugene, suggesting that these interpretations need standardization for the currently used sequencing methods and that they may be associated with different outcomes when eventually are used."
3239,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 RNA levels in semen and blood compartments decrease below detection limits during highly active antiretroviral therapy. Despite these therapeutic effects, it is clear that persistent, latent HIV-1 reservoirs are capable of rebounding in the absence of drug treatment or by evolution of escape mutants remain. The current study was designed to examine the presence of latent virus in semen and blood compartments and its evolution following potent combination therapy with indinavir (protease inhibitor) and efavirenz [nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor]. Using an ultrasensitive in situ hybridization assay HIV-1 mRNA was detected in cultured seminal and blood mononuclear cells in all patients up to 1789 days posttherapy. Higher levels of HIV-1 mRNA were consistently detected in seminal mononuclear cells as compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in all time points analyzed posttherapy. Analysis of viral RNA from cultured PBMC before and after therapy displayed no evidence of therapy-induced drug resistance in the viral polymerase gene in the majority of patients. However, distinct envelope populations were detected in these viral RNA populations following therapy, indicating possible selection of quasispecies. The observed ongoing replication and evolution in the PBMC viral envelope sequences likely occurred in the seminal compartment HIV populations, given that the seminal cells showed the ability to express HIV-1 mRNA following cultivation. This together with our previous studies (Gupta P, et al.: J Infect Dis 2000;182:79-87) suggest that the genital and blood compartments likely serve as distinct reservoirs harboring latent HIV-1 during prolonged drug therapy."
8225,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 evolution and the possible emergence of mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral inhibitors have been evaluated in a cohort of sixty-three patients successfully treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The patients under effective HAART were recruited in three different hospitals in Spain, and none of them had been treated (naïve) before entering this study. HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined, and nucleotide sequences of proviral regions encoding protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) were obtained for longitudinal blood samples spanning a mean follow-up period of 88 weeks. Phylogenetic reconstructions and calculations of genetic distances among the different sequences of each patient were performed. All except one of the patients under study showed an early and sustained decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA to levels that were below 200 copies/ml. The plasma viral decline paralleled a significant increase in the CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. Amino acid sequence analyses revealed the occurrence of mutations associated with antiretroviral resistance in nine patients (14.3%) during HAART treatment, that in some cases could be attributed to excess G to A transitions. In six of the nine patients, the mutations conferred resistance to inhibitors administered in the treatment regime, although the mutations did not result in treatment failure. Sequence comparisons revealed viral evolution during the period of treatment in 47.5% of the patients. The results indicate successful suppression of HIV-1 under HAART for extended time periods, indistinguishable for patients in which evidence of virus evolution could or could not be documented."

A prospective study was conducted among HIV-1 infected patients who had negative HBV serologies. Anti-HBs antibody was evaluated one month after completing a 3-injection course of hepatitis B vaccine. Patients who had an anti-HBs antibody level >10 mlU/ml were defined as responders. There were 65 patients with a mean age of 39+/-8.5 years, 68% were females. Fifty-seven (88%) patients had received antiretroviral therapy for a mean (SD) duration of 26.1 (22.3) months and 75% of these had an HIV-1 RNA count <50 copies/ml. The mean (SD) CD4 cell count and percentage at the time of vaccination were 345 (194) cells/mm3 and 16 (7) %, respectively. Thirty patients (46%) were responders. Compared to non-responders, responders had a higher mean CD4 cell count (p = 0.047) and a trend toward a younger age (p = 0.052). On multivariate analysis, younger age (p = 0.049) and higher CD4 cell count (p = 0.048) were predictors for successful response to hepatitis B vaccination. Determination of antibody levels after vaccination in HIV-infected patients is warranted."
3763,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to assess the analytical and clinical relevance of minority variants using a new pyrosequencing (PSQ) assay and to detect minor variants with frequencies below the current 20% clinical setting limit. A PSQ approach for detecting and quantifying mutations was developed for the analysis of 14 codons of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) gene below the limit of conventional sequencing. Ten patients who experienced virological failure (VF) after a first-line regimen of lamivudine, tenofovir, and either efavirenz, nevirapine, or etravirine, as well as 10 controls patients without VF, were included in this retrospective study. Baseline plasma and plasma from the time of VF were assessed using Sanger sequencing and PSQ methods. The analytical sensitivity for the detection of minor sequence variants is 5%. At baseline, no minority variant was detected in 10/10 patient controls using both the Sanger sequencing and PSQ assays, whereas, two patients who failed therapy had baseline non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations that were not detected by the standard genotyping. At the time of VF, standard genotyping detected mutations in four out of the 10 VF patients, whereas, PSQ detected mutations in five out of the 10 VF patients. Clinically, minority mutations at a 10% level of detection can be assessed efficiently by pyrosequencing and used as a suitable predictor of the evolution of viral populations. These traits allow for a better interpretation of data analysis, which can help clinicians in providing a suitable treatment for HIV."

Survival analysis was employed to assess the virological response as time to HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml and immunological response as time to a CD4 cell count increase of ≥ 100/μl from baseline. Predictors of these outcomes were analyzed by multivariate Cox regression models. In 191 treatments with maraviroc, virological response was achieved in 65.4% and the response was modestly influenced by the baseline viral load and concomitant drug activity but not influenced by the type of tropism assay employed. Immunological response was achieved in 58.1%; independent predictors were baseline HIV-1 RNA (per log10 higher: HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05-1.60) and concomitant therapy with enfuvirtide (HR 2.05, 0.96-4.39) but not tropism assay results. Of 17 patients with baseline R5-tropic virus and available tropism results while viremic during follow-up on maraviroc, seven (41%) showed a tropism switch to non-R5 virus. A significant proportion of experienced patients treated with regimens containing maraviroc achieved virological response. The tropism test type used was not associated with immunovirological response and concomitant treatment with enfuvirtide increased the chance of immunological response. More than half of virological failures with maraviroc were not accompanied by tropism switch."
3857,0.005,1.0000,"The evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) env gp120 region was addressed in HIV-1 infected children showing virological failure to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Sequence analysis of the replicating plasma virus at baseline and after one year of therapy documented evolution of gp120 in all subjects but one. Analysis of the host's selective pressure showed that the values of Ka/Ks ratios were higher in the V3 sequence than in the whole C2-V5 region in 4 of 5 children with improvement of thymic output. Moreover, in 2 of the 4 chidren, the V3 evolution paralleled with a reverse shift of the viral phenotype (from CXCR4-tropic to CCR5-tropic). These results suggest that, under ART, the V3 evolution towards less pathogenic viral variants may be driven by the host's increased selective pressure following restoration of thymic function and immune reconstitution."
5572,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection disrupts the intestinal immune system, leading to microbial translocation and systemic immune activation. We investigated the impact of HIV-1 infection on the intestinal microbiome and its association with mucosal T-cell and dendritic cell (DC) frequency and activation, as well as with levels of systemic T-cell activation, inflammation, and microbial translocation. Bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing was performed on colon biopsies and fecal samples from subjects with chronic, untreated HIV-1 infection and uninfected control subjects. Colon biopsies of HIV-1-infected subjects had increased abundances of Proteobacteria and decreased abundances of Firmicutes compared with uninfected donors. Furthermore at the genus level, a significant increase in Prevotella and decrease in Bacteroides was observed in HIV-1-infected subjects, indicating a disruption in the Bacteroidetes bacterial community structure. This HIV-1-associated increase in Prevotella abundance was associated with increased numbers of activated colonic T cells and myeloid DCs. Principal coordinates analysis demonstrated an HIV-1-related change in the microbiome that was associated with increased mucosal cellular immune activation, microbial translocation, and blood T-cell activation. These observations suggest that an important relationship exists between altered mucosal bacterial communities and intestinal inflammation during chronic HIV-1 infection. "
8729,0.005,1.0000,"Activation and expansion of dengue virus-specific T cells and abnormal liver functions in dengue patients have been documented. However, it remains to be determined whether T cells are involved in the pathogenic mechanism of dengue virus infection. In this study, immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice were employed to study dengue virus-induced T cell activation. Mice were inoculated with 10(8) PFU dengue virus serotype 2 strain 16681 by the intravenous route. Dengue viral core RNA was detected by RT-PCR in mouse serum, liver, spleen, and brain at different time points after infection. Splenic T cells were activated as evidenced by their expression of CD69 and O-glycosylated CD43 at as early as day 3 after infection. Splenic T cell expression of O-glycosylated CD43 and IFN-gamma production coordinately peaked at day 5. Coincided with the peak of splenic T cell activation was hepatic lymphocyte infiltration and elevation of liver enzymes. Flow cytometric analysis revealed the infiltrating CD8(+) T cell to CD4(+) T cell ratio was 5/3. After a second inoculation of dengue virus, hepatic T cell infiltration and liver enzyme levels increased sharply. The infiltrating hepatic CD8(+) T cell to CD4(+) T cell ratio increased to 5.8/1. A strong correlation was found between T cell activation and hepatic cellular infiltration in immunocompetent mice infected with dengue virus. The kinetics of liver enzyme elevation also correlated with that of T cell activation. These data suggest a relationship between T cell infiltration and elevation of liver enzymes."
6302,0.005,1.0000,"In order to study the effect of increased CD4 cell counts on the biology of hepatitis C virus (HCV), we analyzed the genetic variability of HCV generated over 8 y in eight human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and HCV co-infected patients. This was a retrospective study in which HIV patients were selected who had profound immune impairment evident over four years and were co-infected with HCV genotype 1 and who then went on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). These patients achieved different degrees of immune reconstitution, measured as increased CD4 cell counts during a 4- to 8-y period, following initiation of HAART. HCV genetic variability was determined by measuring the genetic diversity (Hamming distance, HD), and complexity (number of viral variants) in plasma samples collected at yearly intervals just before and after the initiation of HAART. The parameters were assessed by molecular cloning and sequencing of a 575-bp fragment including the HCV envelope 1 and envelope 2 genes (E1/E2), containing the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1). significantly increased HVR1 genetic diversity was observed in analyzed samples where the patients' CD4 cell counts were > or =100 compared with CD4 cell counts <100. A significant increase in genetic diversity in HVR1 was detected in co-infected patients whose CD4 cell counts increased from <100 to >400 over a period of more than 4 y of HAART therapy. This was in contrast to a minimal increase in HCV genetic diversity of HVR1 occurring in patients whose CD4 cell counts failed to rise much over 200 over 7 y of follow up. Insertion and deletion of HCV genomic fragments in the E1/E2 region was documented in one patient who developed fulminant hepatitis C."

The use of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 in obese patients with type 2 diabetes on HIV retroviral as an alternative to insulin therapy is not documented; we report the case of a 47-year-old treated with exenatide when insulin was discontinued. During the first year of treatment, exenatide, in combination with metformin and repaglinide, led to a weight loss of 14 kg and fat mass and waist circumference were respectively reduced from 31 to 25.5% and from 114 to 103 cm. Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) was used to calculate β-cell secretion which increased from 50 to 78% and insulin sensitivity which increased from 28 to 51%, reflecting a decrease in HbA(1c) by 1.9%.

5832,0.005,1.0000,"In some patients with chronic liver disease induced by hepatitis B virus, viral DNA is known to persist in low concentration in serum after seroconversion to hepatitis B surface antibody-positivity. This phenomenon has, however, not been documented in asymptomatic black African carriers of hepatitis B virus. Using nested amplification by the polymerase chain reaction, we detected low concentrations of hepatitis B virus DNA in the serum of 6 of 23 (26%) healthy black African adults with normal liver function and with hepatitis B virus surface antibody as the only serological marker of the virus. This finding offers one explanation for the earlier observation of integrated hepatitis B virus DNA in hepatocellular carcinomas in black Africans whose serum was positive for surface antibody alone. A number of genetic changes were found in the six isolates that might be responsible for evasion of the immune response and persistence of the virus. Isolated mutations were detected in the ""a"" determinant of the surface gene and in the encapsidation signal. In all five isolates sequenced in the core promoter, mutations were present in the upstream regulatory region. Recombination between genotypes A and D was present in three of the isolates, including both of those in which the entire genome was sequenced. This change in genotype also overlapped the amino end of the polymerase domain and may result in sufficiently low levels of replication to allow viral persistence. Topoisomerase 1 specific trinucleotides were concentrated in the vicinity of the recombination breakpoints."
5489,0.005,1.0000,"In West and West Central Africa, multiple subtypes, circulating recombinant forms (CRF), and high proportions of unique recombinant forms (URF) are documented. The predominance of recombinants strongly suggests that dual infections occur frequently. In the present study, we adapted the multi-region hybridization assay (MHA), previously developed to identify dual infections in geographic regions where few HIV-1 variants circulate, to identify HIV-1 variants and dual infections. We designed clade-specific probes in three genomic regions (gag p17, vpu, nef) to detect eight different variants that are common in this part of Africa (A, B/D, C, F, G, CRF02_AG, CRF06_cpx, CRF22_01A1). The assay was validated with 163 samples representing the corresponding HIV-1 variants. Depending on the genomic regions, the global sensitivity of the assay ranged from 86% to 94%, and the global specificity was between 85% and 96%. The assay was then applied on 156 antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from Cameroon. The MHA assay identified 79%, 85% and 90% of the strains in nef, gag and vpu regions, respectively. The subtype/CRF distribution and the proportion of inter-region recombinants obtained by the new MHA assay were in accordance with known subtype/CRF distribution in Cameroon. Moreover, the MHA assay identified 35 (22.4%) patients as dually infected, from which 20 were reactive in more than one region and/or with concordant multigenomic recombination pattern. Despite the high genetic diversity, we successfully developed an hybridization assay allowing identification of eight common HIV-1 variants circulating in West and West Central Africa. We documented high rates of dual infection in a low-risk population group, illustrating that the global evolution of HIV diversity is driven by dual infections. This assay could become a useful screening tool for the global surveillance and monitoring of inter-subtype/CRF dual infections in West and West Central Africa."

625,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute hepatitis in many parts of the world including Asia, Africa and Latin America. Though self-limiting in normal individuals, it results in ~30% mortality in infected pregnant women. It has also been reported to cause acute and chronic hepatitis in organ transplant patients. Of the seven viral genotypes, genotype-1 virus infects humans and is a major public health concern in South Asian countries. Sporadic cases of genotype-3 and 4 infection in human and animals such as pigs, deer, mongeese have been reported primarily from industrialized countries. Genotype-5, 6 and 7 viruses are known to infect animals such as wild boar and camel, respectively. Genotype-3 and 4 viruses have been successfully propagated in the laboratory in mammalian cell culture. However, genotype-1 virus replicates poorly in mammalian cell culture and no other efficient model exists to study its life cycle. Here, we report that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress promotes genotype-1 HEV replication by inducing cap-independent, internal initiation mediated translation of a novel viral protein (named ORF4). Importantly, ORF4 expression and stimulatory effect of ER stress inducers on viral replication is specific to genotype-1. ORF4 protein sequence is mostly conserved among genotype-1 HEV isolates and ORF4 specific antibodies were detected in genotype-1 HEV patient serum. ORF4 interacted with multiple viral and host proteins and assembled a protein complex consisting of viral helicase, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), X, host eEF1α1 (eukaryotic elongation factor 1 isoform-1) and tubulinβ. In association with eEF1α1, ORF4 stimulated viral RdRp activity. Furthermore, human hepatoma cells that stably express ORF4 or engineered proteasome resistant ORF4 mutant genome permitted enhanced viral replication. These findings reveal a positive role of ER stress in promoting genotype-1 HEV replication and pave the way towards development of an efficient model of the virus. "

The existence of HBV variants with primary antiviral resistance may be important for treatment choice. We studied two patients with chronic HBV infection by sequencing the HBV polymerase gene. They had adefovir- and tenofovir-related mutations in the viral polymerase, although they had never been treated. These mutations were rtV214A/rtN238T in one patient and rtA194T in the other. Thus, mutations in untreated patients deserve cautious surveillance. These data indicate that mutations that can theoretically confer adefovir or tenofovir resistance may emerge in treatment-naive patients."
8462,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the etiological factor for Hepatitis C, which is one of the most important pathogenic factors of chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV infection brings great threat to human health. Host genetic background could impact HCV infection, viral clearance, and treatment. Recently, some genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of HCV patients were performed. The results showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IL28B gene, which encodes protein IFN-lambda3, are associated with viral clearance and treatment effectiveness of HCV patients who were cured by PEG-IFNalpha combined with ribavirin (RBV). IFN-lambda3 interacts with its acceptor, a heterodimer (IFN-lambdaR1 x IL-10R2), and upregulates the IFN-stimulated gene factors (ISGF). IFN-lambda3 plays roles in antiviral, antitumor, and immunoloregulation, and thus it might become a potential drug for Hepatitis C treatment. However, the mechanism of the IL28B gene in HCV infection and treatment is unclear, and further studies are needed to reveal the veils and provide theoretical basis for developing a new antiviral drug in clinic."
4702,0.005,1.0000,"The effect of host cell factors on infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was studied by infecting a monoblastoid cell line (U937) or a T-cell line (MOLT-4) with a highly infective single clone of HIV-1 and comparing the infectivity of the produced viruses to different cell lines. Chronically infected U937 cells consistently produced viruses with minimal infectivity. This phenotypic change was host-dependent as the back-passage of the U937-produced low infective viruses into MOLT-4 cells resulted in regaining their original high infectivity. Southern and Northern blot analyses of the HIV-1 grown in U937 cells did not reveal any genomic difference between it and the virus grown it MOLT-4 cells. The radioimmunoprecipitation analysis of viral proteins showed that the HIV-1-infected U937 cells had a different pattern of envelope glycoproteins and core proteins, which well correlated with the low infectivity of the produced viruses. This experimental system using MOLT-4 and U937 cell lines would be useful to further explore host cell factor(s) which play an important role in the regulation of HIV-1 infectivity."
6447,0.005,1.0000,"Since their introduction, hepatotoxicity has been associated with the use of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protease inhibitors (PIs). However, the complexity of the HIV-infected patient and the combinations of medications used to treat HIV complicate the understanding of the independent effects of PIs in the development of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). I discuss the current understanding of PI-associated hepatotoxicity. Of the PI regimens studied, the greatest risk of DILI has been observed among patients receiving full-dose ritonavir. Similarly, hepatitis B and/or C virus coinfection has been associated with a greater risk of DILI, compared with those with no hepatitis. Although the specific mechanism by which viral hepatitis increases this risk is not known, patients with cirrhosis may have decreased cytochrome P450 activity, leading to increased PI exposure. Clearly, further research is needed to define the interaction of PIs and chronic viral hepatitis in the development of DILI."
6199,0.005,1.0000,"Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission histories are invaluable models for investigating the evolutionary and transmission dynamics of the virus and to assess the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstructions. Here we have characterized an HIV-1 transmission chain consisting of nine infected patients, almost all of whom were treated with antiviral drugs at later stages of infection. Partial pol and env gp41 regions of the HIV genome were directly sequenced from plasma viral RNA for at least one sample from each patient. Phylogenetic analyses in pol using likelihood methods inferred an evolutionary history not fully compatible with the known transmission history. This could be attributed to parallel evolution of drug resistance mutations resulting in the incorrect clustering of multidrug-resistant virus. On the other hand, a fully compatible phylogenetic tree was reconstructed from the env sequences. We were able to identify and quantify the molecular footprint of drug-selective pressure in pol using maximum likelihood inference under different codon substitution models. An increased fixation rate of mutations in the HIV population of the multidrug-resistant patient was demonstrated using molecular clock modeling. We show that molecular evolutionary analyses, guided by a known transmission history, can reveal the presence of confounding factors like natural selection and caution should be taken when accurate descriptions of HIV evolution are required."

Mathematical models describe that the co-occurrence of HIV and HCV among injecting drug users is such under an HCV prevalence of about 35% the probability of an HIV epidemic is low, but above this threshold an, HIV epidemic is to be expected. According to these models, there is a looming probability of an HIV epidemic among injecting drug users in Hungary, especially in Budapest. There are four ways to prevent or delay such an epidemic: 1. substitution treatment programs; 2. legal access to injecting equipment; 3. free and confidential HIV and HCV counseling and rapid testing; and 4. hygienic injecting environment. In order to avoid a predicted HIV epidemic, epidemiological pattern of HCV among injecting drug users in Hungary requires both a comprehensive prevention response and the systematic monitoring of the epidemiological situation.

This is a prospective study of all treatment-naive patients (N=735) recruited from all three public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal and followed up at 6 and 12 months being on ART. Results indicated that despite a decrease in stigma seen in this study (may be due to ART) the level of stigma and discrimination remains high, and stigma reduction interventions are urgently needed in this population. CD4 cell counts significantly increased and HIV symptoms reduced significantly but depression symptoms remained high and even increased after 12 months on treatment. In multivariate analysis lower CD4 cell counts (odds ratio 0.5, 0.3-0.9), severe depression (5.6, 2.5-12.5) and low QoL (0.6, 0.5-0.8) were associated with internalized AIDS stigma.

The structure and function of IN is highly conserved. The human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) IN has been shown to efficiently support 3' processing and strand transfer of HIV-1 DNA substrate in vitro. To determine whether HIV-2 IN protein (IN(2)) could substitute for HIV-1 IN function in vivo, we used HIV-1 Vpr to deliver the IN(2) into IN mutant HIV-1 virions by expression in trans as a Vpr-IN fusion protein. Trans-complementation with IN(2) markedly increased the infectivity of IN-minus HIV-1. Compared with the homologous trans-IN protein, infectivity was increased to a level of 16%. Since IN has been found to play a role in reverse transcription (Wu et al., J. Virol. 73:2126-2135, 1999), cells infected with IN(2)-complemented HIV-1 were analyzed for DNA products of reverse transcription. DNA levels of approximately 18% of that of wild type were detected. The homologous trans-IN protein restored the synthesis of viral cDNA to approximately 86% of that of wild-type virus. By complementing integration-defective HIV-1 IN mutant viruses, which were not impaired in cDNA synthesis, the trans-IN(2) protein was shown to support integration up to a level of 55% compared with that of the homologous trans-IN protein. The delivery of heterologous IN protein into HIV-1 particles in trans offers a novel approach to understand IN protein function in vivo."

Thirty-four percent of participating boards thought risk for HIV-1 infection in missionaries in Africa was greater than it was for the general US population, and 53% considered it greater for overseas medical staff serving in the region than for domestic health care workers. Nevertheless, only 24% of boards had formal AIDS education programs for overseas health care workers, and 19% for nonmedical personnel going abroad. Medical care provision and acquisition were considered high-risk activities; 42% of boards with a known policy acknowledged that disposable injection equipment was routinely reused, 68% indicated that immunizations were provided abroad, and 60% admitted that inoculations were administered by indigenous health care workers. The most frequently cited specific suggestion for decreasing the risk of HIV-1 infection overseas was the implementation of a walking blood bank program.

Up to 40% of HBV-infected patients can progress to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or chronic end-stage liver disease during their lifetime. This, in turn, is responsible for around 650000 deaths annually worldwide. Repeated hepatitis flares may increase the progression of liver fibrosis, making the accurate diagnosis of the stage of liver fibrosis critical in order to make antiviral therapeutic decisions for HBV-infected patients. Liver biopsy remains the ""gold standard"" for diagnosing liver fibrosis. However, this technique has recently been challenged by the development of several novel noninvasive tests to evaluate liver fibrosis, including serum markers, combined models and imaging techniques. In addition, the cost and accessibility of imaging techniques have been suggested as additional limitations for invasive assessment of liver fibrosis in developing countries. Therefore, a noninvasive assessment model has been suggested to evaluate liver fibrosis, specifically in HBV-infected patients, owing to its high applicability, inter-laboratory reproducibility, wide availability for repeated assays and reasonable cost. The current review aims to present the status of knowledge in this new and exciting field, and to highlight the key points in HBV-infected patients for clinicians. "

This study aims at reporting our experience with percutaneous LBx in a cohort of haemophiliacs infected with HCV and describe the spectrum of disease and impact of HIV coinfection. A retrospective review of consecutive patients with haemophilia and HCV who underwent percutaneous LBx was performed. All patients were positive for HCV RNA by commercial assay and received factor concentrate prior to biopsy. A total of 29 male patients (mean age 36, 24 haemophilia A, five haemophilia B, and 44% coinfected with HIV) underwent successful outpatient percutaneous LBx without bleeding complication. Histologic activity index was 6.44 with advanced fibrosis (bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis) in 31%. When patients were stratified by HIV positive (n = 13) vs. HIV negative (n = 16), coinfected patients had higher fibrosis scores and higher proportion advanced fibrosis (54% vs. 12%; P = 0.0167) with no differences in age, demographic or other laboratory parameters. Multivariate logistic regression found that HIV positivity was independently associated with advanced fibrosis (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.17-11.8; P = 0.026). Outpatient percutaneous LBx can be safely performed in patients with haemophilia. Despite similar age, HIV coinfection was an independent predictor of advanced fibrosis. These data support the hypothesis that HIV accelerates fibrosis progression in those coinfected with HCV and highlights the importance of liver histology in this population."

The objective of this study was to estimate the burden of liver disease and evaluate determinants of liver fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity among HIV/HCV coinfected patients receiving ART. We studied 112 randomly selected and 98 referred HCV-infected patients undergoing care in the Johns Hopkins University HIV clinic. Liver disease was characterized clinically and histologically. Of the 210 individuals studied--64% of whom had received ART within 2 years of liver disease assessment--33% had no fibrosis (F0), and 26% had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (> or =F3). The median necroinflammatory activity score was 3 (range, 0-9 of 18). ART was not associated with fibrosis; however, significantly less hepatic necroinflammatory activity was observed among persons who had received highly active antiretroviral therapy longer (P = .02) and more effectively (defined by HIV RNA suppression; P < .01). Twelve percent of individuals had previous ART-associated liver enzyme elevations (grades 3-4), but liver fibrosis was not more severe if the liver enzyme elevation resolved. On the other hand, liver fibrosis was more severe in persons with persistent liver enzyme elevations (grades 1-4). In conclusion, despite widespread exposure to ART and documented instances of ART-related hepatitis, we found no evidence that ART caused serious histological liver disease. Recognition of bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis in some but not most patients underscores the importance of identifying and treating liver disease in HIV/HCV coinfected persons."

Drugs with a low level of potential toxicity, especially those that are not nucleoside analogues, should be evaluated in healthy individuals who are not infected with HIV before trials in HIV-infected patients commence. The guideline also discusses possible clinical and laboratory end points for efficacy and emphasizes the need for careful validation of all laboratory end points used. The approach of the guideline is deliberately general: more specific recommendations would soon become outdated in this field, which is characterized by extremely rapid developments."

7711,0.005,1.0000,"The Early Intervention Program (EIP) is California's publicly funded human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care and treatment program with 30 sites throughout the state. Our objective for this study was to examine the number of days from first HIV-positive result until enrollment into EIP by race/ethnicity, behavioral risk, and other characteristics, with data from clients who enrolled in an EIP site after the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapies. For Model I, logistic regression distinguished clients diagnosed with HIV and enrolled in EIP on the same day (0 days) from those with values of 1+ days; linear regression was then used on the log transformation of days for the majority of clients not diagnosed and enrolled on the same day. For Model II, logistic regression was used to identify client characteristics related to enrollment in EIP over 6 weeks from the date of HIV diagnosis. We found that Latinos were more likely than whites to enroll in EIP on the day they were diagnosed with HIV. For clients not diagnosed and enrolled in EIP on the same day, no differences across racial and ethnic groups were found for days until enrollment in HIV care and treatment. However, clients with a history of injection drug use took longer from the day they were diagnosed with HIV to enroll in EIP. The California EIP represents a model for programs seeking equity in access to HIV care and treatment across racial and ethnic groups. Getting injectors into timely HIV care and treatment represents a challenge."

1679,0.005,1.0000,"The epidemic of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) poses a major ethical question: How can we control the epidemic and the harm that it causes without unjustly discriminating against particular social groups and without unnecessarily infringing on the freedom of individuals? This question pertains to three spheres of public policy in the United States: public health, the delivery of health care, and research. In the public health sphere, vigorous educational efforts will be required, as will modified approaches to intravenous drug use, prostitution, and homosexual and bisexual sexual activity. Carefully targeted, voluntary testing and screening programs should be coupled with counseling and with guarantees of confidentiality and nondiscrimination where these are appropriate. Both health care workers and the health care system have a moral obligation to provide care to people with HIV infection, but heroic self-sacrifice should not be required provided that infection control precautions are observed. Patients with neurological involvement and terminally ill patients will benefit from statutes allowing recognition of advance directives about preferred modes of care or nontreatment. There is a moral imperative to perform intensive research directed toward the understanding, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection and AIDS.

7332,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) remain among the most common disorders in people infected with HIV, even in an era when potent antiretroviral therapy is widely deployed. This review discusses the clinical features of HANDs and the implications for more effective treatment. With the improved survival of individuals treated with antiretrovirals, comorbid conditions are increasingly salient, including particularly coinfection with hepatitis C and the effects of aging. This review attempts to answer why there appears to be a therapeutic gap between the salutary effects of antiretroviral regimens and normalization of neurological function. A second gap is found in the understanding of the pathophysiology of HANDs. This review addresses this and discusses the animal models that have helped to elucidate these mechanisms. Although triggered by productive HIV infection of brain macrophages, aberrant and sustained immune activation appears to play a major role in inducing HANDs, and may explain the often incomplete neurological response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Novel therapies aimed at persistent central nervous system inflammation will be needed to close this gap."

Awareness of HIV-positive status may alter the likelihood for PLWHA smokers to change their smoking habit. In this study, we tested the risk enhancement and risk reduction hypotheses by assessing changes in cigarette smoking behavior among PLWHA after they received the positive results of their HIV tests. Cross-sectional survey data collected from a random sample of 2973 PLWHA in care in Guangxi, China were analyzed. Changes in cigarette smoking after receiving the HIV-positive test results, as well as the current levels of cigarette smoking were measured. Among the total participants, 1529 (51.7%) were self-identified as cigarette smokers, of whom 436 (28.9%) reduced smoking and 286 (19.0%) quit after receiving their HIV-positive test results. Among the quitters, 210 (73.9%) remained abstinent for a median duration of two years. There were also 124 (8.2%) who increased cigarette smoking. Older age, female gender, more education, and receiving antiretroviral therapy were associated with quitting. In conclusion, our study findings support the risk reduction and risk enhancement hypotheses. A large proportion of smoking PLWHA reduced or quit smoking, while a small proportion increased smoking. Findings of this study suggest that the timing when a person receives his or her HIV-positive test result may be an ideal opportunity for care providers to deliver tobacco cessation interventions. Longitudinal studies are indicated to verify the findings of this study and to support smoking cessation intervention among PLWHA in the future. "

After adjustments were made for correlation of intrapatient clonal variation, mixed-model analysis indicated that nucleotide and amino acid variability among patients with different genotypes did not differ significantly. However, within individual patients, clonal variability differed by up to 5.3% and 5.8% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, and genotype 1a had significantly greater nucleotide variability than other genotypes (P = 0.01).

3594,0.005,1.0000,"A hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome was isolated and sequenced from a single Japanese patient with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. The genome (HCV-JT), which was constructed with 23 cDNA clones, consisted of 9436 nucleotides with a long open reading frame which could encode a sequence of 3010 amino acid residues. To study the sequence variation of the HCV genome in an individual, we analyzed another sequence of the HCV genome (HCV-JT') constructed with different cDNA clones derived from the same patient. The nucleotide variation between HCV-JT and -JT' was less than 1%, and was distributed throughout the genome except in the 5' non-coding region, where no variation was observed. The diversity was higher (1.6%) in the putative envelope protein region than in other regions. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of HCV-JT showed homologies of about 91 and 95%, respectively, with those of other Japanese HCV isolates. The nucleotide diversity was high in the gp 70 region (corresponding to the NS 1 region of flaviviruses) and low in the 5' non-coding and p22 (putative core protein) regions. A similar pattern of distribution of nucleotide changes was observed on comparison of HCV-JT with an American isolate HCV-US, where the homologies in nucleotide and amino acid sequences were about 79 and 85%, respectively. Base transversions contributed about 50% of the total base exchanges between the Japanese and American HCV sequences, but only 20% or less of those among Japanese HCV or among American HCV sequences. Thus, the Japanese and American HCVs are genetically distinguishable, supporting our earlier prediction that these two HCVs could be classified as different subtypes."
7168,0.005,1.0000,"The degree of change in the nucleotide sequence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that occurs when it is transmitted sexually from one individual to another or vertically from mother to child is unknown. Previous studies have shown that most cultured HIV-1 isolates from the same individuals differed in the entire envelope gene nucleotide sequence by up to 2%, although most isolates from unrelated individuals differed by 6-22%. To examine diversity among HIV-1 isolates from close contacts, we determined the nucleotide sequences of viruses from a family with a known epidemiologic profile, in which a woman transmitted HIV-1 heterosexually to her partner and vertically to her daughter. Direct DNA sequence analysis of primary HIV-1 isolates amplified by PCR was used to distinguish the major and minor viral sequences, termed quasispecies, to rapidly determine the predominant sequences and their phylogenetic relationships. The nucleotide sequence diversity of a major portion of the HIV-1 envelope gene was 3.7% between isolates from the woman and her heterosexual partner and 8.5% between isolates from this woman and her daughter, who had been infected for a longer period than the partner. The configuration of the phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the daughter's predominant isolate evolved from a progenitor of her mother's current strain. This study provides evidence of a continuous spectrum of sequence diversity between any two isolates ranging from those derived from the same person to those from close contacts and, ultimately, those from unrelated individuals. These data and methods can be applied to epidemiologic investigations of possible HIV-1 transmission between health care workers and their patients."
166,0.005,1.0000,"To determine whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains in the lungs of infected individuals are derived from proviral forms contemporaneously present in the peripheral blood or whether they evolve independently as an autonomous pool of viral quasispecies, HIV-1 envelope V3 domain structures at these sites were analyzed and compared. The V3 loop proviral nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequences from lung bronchoalveolar lavage, where HIV-1 is primarily found in macrophages, were more homogeneous within individuals than those from unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where virus is predominantly in T cells. Comparison between individuals revealed that strains from bronchoalveolar lavage, but not from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, contained V3 domain nucleotide sequences with a great degree of homogeneity in the C-terminal region and a highly conserved, negatively charged amino acid motif. This V3 loop C-terminal structure could be important in the ability of HIV-1 to infect alveolar macrophages. Phylogenetic analyses of V3 domain nucleotide sequences in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage at both sites revealed the strains in lung macrophages to have evolved further from a presumed ancestral species than those in blood monocytes and to differ considerably in the inferred V3 loop amino acid structures. These results show that, as disease progression occurs, viral strains in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells within the lung and blood microenvironments are not in a state of unrestricted bidirectional traffic but, instead, evolve independently."
1685,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be subtyped on the basis of nucleotide sequence variability. Knowledge of circulating HIV-1 genotypes or subtypes allows understanding of the origin and spread of HIV-1 in different geographical regions, and is required for rational vaccine development. A study was undertaken to determine the predominant HIV-1 subtype in Australia. Part of the HIV-1 envelope gene (including the variable domain, V3) was sequenced directly from DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 17 HIV-1 seropositive people in Sydney, Australia. Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequence suggested that all patients (including individual cases acquired in New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Thailand) were infected with HIV-1 subtype B. Octapeptides from the HIV-1 envelope V3 loop tip indicated variation but included a predominance of the most common subtype B octapeptides HIGPGRAF (4 cases), NIGPGRAF (3 cases) and PIGPGRAF (1 case). These data suggest that subtype B is the major HIV-1 strain in Australia (and probably in New Zealand and Papua New Guinea), although the importation of HIV-1 acquired overseas is likely to lead to the detection and dissemination of other subtypes in Australia."

A high rate of p53 mutations at codon 249 has been reported in these tumors. The tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) is a useful animal model for the development of HCC after human hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or AFB1 treatment. Therefore, it was of particular interest to determine whether the p53 gene in tree shrew HCCs associated with HBV infection and/or with exposure to AFB1 is affected in the same manner as in human HCCs. We determined the tree shrew p53 wild-type nucleotide sequences by RT-PCR and automatic DNA-sequencing. Tree shrew wild-type p53 sequence showed 91.7 and 93.4% homologies with human p53 nucleotide and amino acids sequences, respectively, while it showed 77.2 and 73.7% homologies in mice. One HCC and normal liver tissue from AFB1 treated and one HCC from AFB1- and HBV-treated tree shrew showed no change in p53 sequences, while three HCCs from AFB1- and HBV-treated tree shrews showed point mutations in p53 sequences. One HCC showed point mutations at codon 275, which is on the DNA-binding domain of p53 gene, which might be a cause of gain-of-function during the development of HCC. As a result, our finding indicates that tree shrews exposed to AFB1 and/or HBV had neither codon 249 mutations nor significant levels of other mutations in the p53 gene, as is the case with humans."

Definitive diagnosis requires kidney biopsy, which shows collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with associated microcystic tubular dilatation and interstitial inflammation. Podocyte proliferation is a hallmark of HIV-associated nephropathy, although this classic pathology is observed less frequently in antiretroviral-treated patients. The pathogenesis of HIV-associated nephropathy involves direct HIV infection of renal epithelial cells, and the widespread introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy has had a significant impact on the natural history and epidemiology of this unique disease. These observations have established antiretroviral therapy as the cornerstone of treatment for HIV-associated nephropathy in the absence of prospective clinical trials.

HIV alters HCV clinical presentation, epidemiology, virology, and pathogenesis compared with HCV monoinfected individuals. The incidence of chronic and vertical HCV infection is increased, the rate of hepatic fibrosis progression is accelerated, peripheral and intrahepatic HCV RNA levels are increased, and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and cirrhosis develop more rapidly in coinfected individuals. Based on these observations, combined with the increased efficacy of ARV therapy, several societies have recommended the diagnosis and treatment of HCV in coinfected individuals. HCV treatment with nonspecific antivirals, pegylated interferon alpha (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), is more complex in coinfected individuals compared with monoinfected individuals because these regimens appear to have decreased efficacy and the incidence of complications is increased. Although new HCV-specific regimens show early promise in HCV monoinfected individuals, it is likely that these agents will be used in combination with nonspecific therapies and additional studies will be required to evaluate their efficacy in coinfected individuals."

Genotype 3 is found in Egypt and parts of Central Africa. Blood transfusion is a major means of acquisition of HCV infection. While treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin is recommended for patients with chronic HCV, no data were found on their use in Africa. Neither were there any data on definitive management (liver transplantation) for those with end stage disease. Data on HCV infection in Africa are scarce.

Multivariate analysis showed that duration of dialysis was significantly associated with anti-HCV seropositivity [OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.2-1.3; P = 0.024]. No other socio-demographic or clinical characteristics (age, sex, level of education, history of surgery, and number of units of blood transfused) were significantly associated with HBsAg or anti-HCV seropositivity. The results of this study suggest that HBsAg and anti-HCV have low prevalence among hemodialysis patients in Khartoum. Longer duration of dialysis was a risk factor for anti-HCV."

Case series with 1-year follow-up. SETTING. Regional hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS. Consecutive patients who were newly diagnosed to have lymphoma in the hospital between 1 April 2007 and 31 March 2008 were tested for hepatitis B (HB) surface (s) antigen (Ag), anti-HBs antibody (Ab) and anti-HB core (c) Ab. Seropositive occult hepatitis B patients as defined by being negative for HBsAg but positive anti-HBsAb and/or anti-HBcAb without a hepatitis B vaccination history were recruited. Serum HBsAg, anti-HBsAb, anti-HBcAb, hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level, and liver biochemistry were checked at baseline and every 4 weeks during and after chemotherapy until 12 months after the completion of chemotherapy or death. Entecavir was started if patients developed biochemical flare-up of hepatitis B associated with virological rebound. The prevalence and course of hepatitis B virus-related hepatitis, as well as any temporal relationship to viral kinetics and clinical hepatitis, were assessed. RESULTS. Of 47 patients tested, 10 (21%) with lymphoma were seropositive occult hepatitis carriers. Their median baseline hepatitis B virus DNA level was 89 IU/mL (range, <34-807 IU/mL). Virological rebound (as defined by a 10-fold increase in serum hepatitis B virus DNA level from pre-chemotherapy level persisted for 4 weeks) occurred in one of the 10 patients, followed by biochemical reactivation. Whereupon entecavir treatment was started and no liver failure ensued. Regarding the other seropositive occult patients, their serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels fluctuated, but there was no associated biochemical reactivation. CONCLUSION. Detectable baseline serum hepatitis B virus DNA is not uncommon in patients with occult hepatitis B who receive chemotherapy. Transient elevation in serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels does not predict biochemical reactivation, but antiviral treatment might be considered if virological rebound persists."

Until now, the natural course of liver diseases induced by coinfections has not been well documented and the mechanisms of interaction between the two viruses and the human host have not been fully clarified. We report the case of a patient suffering from chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus who developed an acute hepatitis B virus superinfection. Serum hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid became undetectable by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction at diagnosis of acute hepatitis B virus infection. At the same time, there was a striking increase in the serum concentrations of the antibodies against C22 and C33c hepatitis C virus antigens. Four months after clinical resolution of the acute hepatitis, hepatitis B surface antigen was undetectable in serum and three months later antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen appeared. Two years after acute hepatitis B virus infection, the patient has had no relapse of markers for viral replication of hepatitis B virus. Transaminases are within the reference range and hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid is undetectable in both serum and liver tissue. We hypothesize that acute hepatitis B virus infection stimulated a specific humoral response against hepatitis C virus as well as triggering non-specific defense mechanisms which finally eliminated both viruses."
5604,0.005,1.0000,"Patients' deaths due to the organ donor shortage make it imperative that every suitable organ be transplanted. False-positive results of tests for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) result in lost organs. A survey of US organ procurement organizations collected the numbers of donors and ruled-out potential donors who had a positive result on an HIV test from January 1,2006, to October 31, 2008. Sixty-two percent of US organ procurement organizations participated. Of the 12397 donor/nondonor cases, 56 (0.45%) had an initial positive result on an HIV antibody or HIV nucleic acid test, and only 8 (14.3%) of those were confirmed positive. Of the false-positive results, 50% were from HIV antibody tests and 50% were from HIV nucleic acid tests. Organs are a scarce, finite, and perishable resource. Use of HIV antibody testing has produced a remarkably safe track record of avoiding HIV transmission, with 22 years of nonoccurrence between transmissions. Because false positives occur with any test, including the HIV Ab test, adding nucleic acid testing to the standard donor testing panel doubles the number of false-positive HIV test results and thus the number of medically suitable donors lost. The required HIV antibody test is 99.99% effective in preventing transmission of the HIV virus. Adding the HIV nucleic acid test to routine organ donor screening could result in as many as 761 to 1551 unnecessary deaths of patients between HIV transmission events because medically suitable organs are wasted."

61,0.005,1.0000,"Most current evidence suggests that the infection of resting CD4(+) T cells by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is not productive due to partial or complete blocks in the viral life cycle at steps prior to integration of the viral genome into the host cell chromosome. However, stimulation of an infected resting T cell by antigen, cytokines, or microenvironmental factors can overcome these blocks and allow for the production of progeny virions. In this study, we sought to understand the structure and fate of the virus in unstimulated resting CD4(+) T cells. Using a novel linker-mediated PCR assay designed to detect and characterize linear unintegrated forms of the HIV-1 genome, we demonstrate that reverse transcription can proceed to completion following the infection of resting T cells, generating the substrate for the retroviral integration reaction. However, reverse transcription in resting T cells is far slower than in activated T cells, requiring 2 to 3 days to complete. The delay in completing reverse transcription may make the viral DNA genome more susceptible to competing decay processes. To explore the relationship between the formation of the linear viral genome and the stability of the preintegration state, we employed a recombinant HIV-1 virus expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein to measure the rate at which HIV-1 decays in the preintegration state. Our results demonstrate that the preintegration state is labile and decays rapidly (half-life = 1 day) following the entry of HIV-1 into a resting T cell, with significant decay occurring during the slow process of reverse transcription."

However, studies have shown that a substantial number of HIV-infected people do not receive antiretroviral treatments. The current study examined the physical and mental health, substance use, and perceptions of medical care of 163 men and 78 women living with HIV/AIDS. Results of a confidential survey showed that 79 (33%) were not currently treated for HIV. These persons did not differ from those who were treated in chart-abstracted CD4 cell counts, years living with HIV infection, HIV-related symptoms, and HIV-related hospitalizations. Unlike past studies, gender was not found to be a factor in treatment status. However, untreated persons had higher chart-abstracted viral loads and were more likely to be ethnic minorities, have a lower level of education, greater level of depression, and greater pessimistic attitude. They were significantly more likely to have used alcohol, powder cocaine, and crack cocaine in the previous 3 months, were likely to know their own viral load and CD4 count, and held significantly more negative views of their health care and their health care providers. There were no differences between untreated and treated persons in their meeting the year 1999 antiretroviral treatment guidelines that were in effect at the time of data collection. These results suggest that persons who are not receiving antiretroviral medications may be in need of mental health and substance use interventions and may benefit from interventions designed to engage and retain them in medical treatment."

The outcome of OLT depends on the prevention of HBV reinfection and disease relapses. Out of 692 liver transplantations performed at Merkur University Hospital, 30 were done for HBV infection. These patients were treated with HBIG post OLT and lamivudine, entecavir, adefovir, tenofovir prior and post OLT. All patients became HBsAg and HBV DNA negative but four of them became HbsAg positive one year post OLT. The patients survived for 2 months to 7 years post OLT. With the introduction of HBIG immunoprophylaxis and new efficient antiviral treatment, the risk of relapse is only < 10%, and survival is the same as in other indications for OLT. Because of the high cost and long-term treatment, efforts have been made to prevent recurrent HBV disease by using the schedules according to pre- and post-transplant HBV viremia and introducing the new potent antiviral analogue nucleos(t)ides."
6527,0.005,1.0000,"Phase 3 trials of direct acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) excluded patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). After approval, small trials were done in HIV-HCV coinfected patients. The status quo results in delayed access to DAAs for HIV coinfected patients, a group with more rapid progression of liver disease. This article reviews all approved DAAs and compares sustained virological response (SVR) rates in the HIV coinfected with those in the HCV monoinfected treated with the same regimen for the same HCV genotype. SVR rates in HCV genotype 1 to 4 are virtually identical in the HIV co-infected as in the HCV monoinfected, regardless of whether the regimens contain interferon. Because HIV coinfection does not affect SVR rates or toxicity with DAA-containing therapy, excluding HIV coinfected patients from clinical trials of DAA-containing anti-HCV therapy is discriminatory and unnecessary. Rather, HIV coinfection is one of many comorbidities that occur in some patients with HCV infection."
3180,0.005,1.0000,"To determine whether a dramatic decrease in hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels within the first months of lamivudine therapy can predict the emergence of YMDD variants in patients with chronic hepatitis B, quantitative testing was done every 3 months on serum samples from 35 patients who were treated with lamivudine for >1 year. The decline in HBV DNA levels from baseline to month 3 was higher in 22 responders than in 13 nonresponders (mean+/-SD, 4.16+/-1.06 vs. 2.88+/-1.77 log(10) copies; P=.002), whereas no differences were observed in patients with and without YMDD variants at 1 year of therapy. At 3 months, HBV DNA was undetectable in 77% of the responders, whereas, after 1 year, it was undetectable in 23% of nonresponders, 40% of patients with YMDD variants, and 74% of those without variants. Therefore, quantitative HBV DNA testing is very useful in deciding whether to continue therapy, because of the low likelihood of response in patients who remain HBV DNA positive at month 3 of treatment."
8869,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has become widely available in China during the past seven years. However, many patients still initiate treatment at very late stages. To understand the distribution of baseline CD4 and factors associated with late antiretroviral therapy (ART) access, the National Free ART Database was retrospectively reviewed and a total of 49,321 HIV/AIDS patients were identified in this study based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) age ≥18; (2) initiated HAART between 1 July, 2006 and 31 December, 2009; (3) have recorded baseline CD4 cell count. This study showed that although both the median and mean baseline CD4 increased consistently over the study period, there were still about 30% of HIV/AIDS patients accessing ART at a very late stage (CD4 ≤ 50 µl) in 2009. Risk factors for late ART access included being male, single, having a short time interval between HIV diagnosis and treatment, and being infected through heterosexual contact. Being infected through injection drug use and homosexual contact were protective. Transmission route and marriage status showed different effects in a gender stratified analysis. A strengthened HIV testing and screening program is the key to improving the accessibility of ART and populations that are vulnerable to sexual transmission of HIV should be the primary target of the program."
3828,0.005,1.0000,"To identify the risk factors associated with presentation for care with CD4 cell count ≤ 200 cells/mm(3) and death in HIV-infected patients in Lyon, France. Data were analyzed on participants from mid-1992 to December 2006 in the Lyon section of the French Hospital Database on HIV Infection. Patients were stratified into two categories according to CD4 cell count at first presentation for care in University of Lyon hospitals: Group 1 (Gr1) patients with CD4 ≤ 200 cells/mm(3) and Group 2 (Gr2) patients with CD4 >200 cells/mm(3). Multivariate logistic regression assessed the risk factors associated with first presentation for care with CD4 ≤ 200 cells/mm(3). Survival was analyzed according to the Cox regression model. Among 3569 eligible patients (838 females and 2731 males, mean age: 36.3 ± 10.3 years), 1139 (31.9%) were categorized as Gr1. The factors associated with first presentation for care with CD4 ≤ 200 cells/mm(3) were: older age, male gender, route of HIV transmission, migrant populations, geographical areas other than Rhône-Alpes, and access to care in 1992-1997. Overall mortality was higher in Gr1 than in Gr2 (24.4% [278/1139] vs. 4.1% [101/2430]; p<0.001). The risk of death was 5.81 [4.61-7.32] in Gr1 compared to Gr2. In addition to CD4 cell count, age and enrollment periods for care were factors independently related to death. Despite public health efforts in Lyon, one-third of HIV-infected patients reach the health care system with CD4 cell count ≤ 200 cells/mm(3), which was linked with higher mortality."

This scaling up of ART has raised challenges to the Kenyan health system due to emergence of drug resistant viruses among those on treatment and possible onward transmission. To counter this, and come up with an effective treatment strategy, it has become vital to determine baseline mutations associated with drug resistance among the circulating strains of HIV-1 in Kenya."
7551,0.005,1.0000,"Plasma levels of soluble CD27 (sCD27) are elevated in diseases characterized by T cell activation and are used as a marker of immune activation. We assessed the usefulness of determining plasma sCD27 as a marker for monitoring immune activation in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A first cross-sectional examination of 68 HIV-1-infected and 18 normal subjects showed high levels of sCD27 in HIV-1 infection; plasma sCD27 was correlated to HIV-1 viraemia and inversely correlated to CD4+ T cell count. Twenty-six HIV-1-infected patients undergoing HAART were studied at baseline and after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of therapy. Seven additional patients under HAART were analysed at baseline, during and after interruption of therapy. In the total population, HAART induced a significant and progressive reduction, but not a normalization, of plasma levels of sCD27 after 24 months. A full normalization of plasma sCD27 was observed in the virological responders (undetectable HIV-1 RNA at months 18 and 24) and also in patients with moderate immunodeficiency at baseline (CD4+ T cell count >200 cells/mm3). Changes in plasma neopterin paralleled the changes in sCD27 but only baseline sCD27 levels were predictive of a greater increase in CD4+ T cell count during the follow-up. Discontinuation of therapy resulted in a rapid increase of sCD27 plasma levels associated with viraemia rebound and drop in CD4+ T cell count. Our findings suggest that plasma sCD27 may represent an alternative and simple marker to monitor immune activation during potent antiretroviral therapy. HIV-1-induced immune activation can be normalized by HAART in successfully treated patients where the disease is not advanced."
7423,0.005,1.0000,"The primary goal when devising strategies to define the start of therapy in HIV infected individuals is to avoid HIV disease progression and toxicity from antiretroviral therapy (ART). Intermediate goals includes, avoiding resistance by suppressing HIV replication, reducing transmission, limiting spread and diversity of HIV within the body and protecting the immune system from harm. The question of how early or late to start ART and achieve both primary and intermediate goals has dominated HIV research. The distinction between early and late treatment of HIV infection is currently a matter of CD4+ T cells count, a marker of immune status, rather than on viral load, a marker of virus replication. Discussions about respective benefits of early or delayed therapy, as well as the best CD4+ T cell threshold during the course of HIV infection at which ART is initiated remains inconclusive. Guidelines issued by various agencies, provide different initiation recommendations. This can be confusing for clinicians and policy-makers when determining the best time to initiate therapy. Optimizing ART initiation strategies are clearly complex and must be balanced between individual and broader public health needs. This review assesses available data that contributes to the debate on optimal time to initiate therapy in HIV-infected asymptomatic individuals. We also review reports on CD4+ T cell threshold to guide initiation of ART and finally discuss arguments for and against early or late initiation of ART. "
8653,0.005,1.0000,"The evaluation of new cases of HIV infection is relatively common in Spain, where several thousands of patients with new infections are diagnosed each year. Eighty per cent of them have a chronic HIV infection at the first clinical evaluation, which is symptomatic (late presenters) in up to 30% of patients. The initial evaluation of HIV infection is not only directed at determining the clinical, virological (plasma HIV RNA viral load, resistance test and viral tropism) and immunological (CD4+ T-cell cell count) situation of the patients, but must also address the study of their co-infections (hepatitis, tuberculosis) and comorbidities (cardiovascular, hepatic, renal and bone) and the risk of HIV transmission. This is needed in order to decide, whether or not to start antiretroviral treatment, and with which combined antiretroviral treatment to start with, the prophylaxis of opportunistic infections, and the treatment of coinfections and comorbidities. The past and current medical history, the physical examination and laboratory tests will help us decide if the patient is to receive therapeutic intervention. The level of CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes is the best marker to suggest when to start combined antiretroviral treatment, indicating whether or not to start prophylaxis against opportunistic infections (if patients have a CD4+ T-cell count below 200 cells/mm(3)), and in advanced patients should make us suspect the presence of active opportunistic diseases in symptomatic cases. The management of patients with HIV infection must also include appropriate health education on the modes of transmission and prevention of HIV infection, and also to explain its natural history and how it can be modified with proper antiretroviral treatment, as well as to promote a healthy life. No less important is the psychological support, as these patients must learn to live with a chronic infection, which managed properly can ensure a very good long-term prognosis and quality of life."
4399,0.005,1.0000,"The availability of HIV-1 genotype resistance testing (GRT) to clinicians has been insufficiently studied outside randomized clinical trials. The present study evaluated the outcome of salvage antiretroviral therapy (ART) recommended by an expert physician based on GRT in a non-clinical trial setting in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil. A prospective, open, nonrandomized study evaluating easy access to GRT at six Brazilian AIDS Clinics was carried out. This cooperative study analyzed the efficacy of treatment recommended to patients whose salvage ART was guided by GRT with that of treatment with ART based only on previous ART history. A total of 112 patients with ART failure were included in the study, and 77 of them were submitted to GRT. The median CD4 cell count and viral load for these 77 patients at baseline were (mean +/- SD) 252.1 +/- 157.4 cells/microL and 4.60 +/- 0.5 log10 HIV RNA copies/mL, respectively. The access time, i.e., the time elapsed between ordering the GRT and receiving the result was, on average, 71.9 +/- 37.3 days. The study results demonstrated that access to GRT followed by expert recommendations did not improve the time to persistent treatment failure when compared to conventional salvage ART. Access to GRT in this Brazilian community health care setting did not improve the long-term virologic outcomes of HIV-infected patients experiencing treatment failure. This result is probably related to the long time required to implement ART guided by GRT."
5687,0.005,1.0000,"In this AIDS commentary, Dr. Wilfert has reviewed the American experience with vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) since the closing of the 076 trial performed by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group in February 1994. The news generally is good; the rate of transmission from mother to child in nonstudy situations has been reduced when counseling and therapy are offered to pregnant women. As Dr. Wilfert emphasizes, the mechanism of the beneficial effect remains to be elucidated. More important, the resources required to insure that women have access to counseling and care need to be secured. In addition to these issues discussed by Dr. Wilfert, questions that need to be addressed include the efficacy and safety of more-potent antiretroviral agents or combinations in further reducing the risk of transmission, the optimal intervention for women who become pregnant while receiving antiretroviral therapy, the optimal postpartum management for women, and the most-effective treatment strategy for children born to infected women. The newborn child who is infected in spite of treatment of the mother potentially could receive great benefit from aggressive therapy designed to reduce the rate of viral replication and the selection of drug-resistant HIV-1. Finally, inexpensive and user-friendly methods of reducing the rate of vertical transmission in developing countries are urgently needed. Progress in reducing the prevalence of pediatric HIV-1 infection transmitted by mothers, the most common source of this infection in children, has been made, but further research and effort to insure access to care and answers to unsolved problems are necessary."

We present here an analysis of patients recorded in the cohort database between 1st of January 2006 and 31st of December 2008. During that period, 11982 patients were under medical follow-up in Belgium. Sixty-one percent of the patients were male and the median age was 39.8 at the time of first recorded viral load. Among the patients whose nationality or probable mode of transmission was recorded, nearly half (48.0%) were Belgian and 38.3% originated from Sub-Saharan Africa; heterosexual contacts were reported in the majority of cases (56.0%) followed by homosexual contacts (35.3%). A total of 145 deaths were reported. Around three quarters of the patients were on ART. The median CD4 cell count rose from 470 cells/mm3 in 2006 to 501 cells/mm3 in 2008. This cohort enabled us to obtain comprehensive information on the numbers and characteristics of HIV-infected patients currently being followed up in Belgium, and on trends in antiretroviral therapy and biological results. This will serve for planning purposes, evaluation of access to care and as a source of information for further studies."
9541,0.005,1.0000,"Differences in the uptake and time to initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the virological response to HAART, and survival from AIDS by transmission category were analyzed. A multicenter hospital-based cohort of HIV-infected patients attending 10 hospitals in Spain from January 1997 to December 2003 was used. Cross-checks with the National AIDS Registry were performed. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the impact of transmission category on time to HAART initiation, viral suppression (defined by first HIV-1 RNA viral load measurement <500 copies/ml after HAART), and survival from AIDS. Of 4643 patients, 73% were men and 56% were injecting drug users (IDUs). A statistically significant interaction was found between transmission category and previous non-HAART antiretroviral treatment (ART) (p < 0.05). Among ART naive patients, IDUs had a 33% lower risk of initiating HAART compared to men who have sex with men (MSM) [HR 0.67 (95% CI 0.57-0.79)]. No differences by transmission categories were seen among patients with prior non-HAART ART. IDUs had poorer viral load (VL) suppression than MSM [HR 0.86 (95% CI 0.74-0.99)] adjusting by baseline VL, AIDS diagnosis, and prior ART. Mortality from AIDS was two and a half times higher in IDUs than MSM [HR 2.51 (95% CI 1.03-6.1)]. Among patients who access the hospital network, IDUs have a lower uptake of HAART, have worse virological suppression, and have higher mortality after AIDS diagnosis. There is a need to extend the programs in order to enhance access and adherence of IDUs to HAART and consider the treatment of drug addiction as an integral part of the treatment for HIV infection."
8794,0.005,1.0000,"Infections by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) involve interactions of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 with CD4 and then with a coreceptor. R5 isolates of HIV-1 use CCR5 as a coreceptor, whereas X4 isolates use CXCR4. It is not known whether coreceptors merely trigger fusion of the viral and cellular membranes or whether they also influence the energetics of virus adsorption, the placement of the membrane fusion reaction, and the metabolism of adsorbed gp120. Surprisingly, the pathway for metabolism of adsorbed gp120 has not been investigated thoroughly in any cells. To address these issues, we used purified (125)I-gp120s derived from the R5 isolate BaL and from the X4 isolate IIIB as ligands for binding onto human cells that expressed CD4 alone or CD4 with a coreceptor. The gp120 preparations were active in forming ternary complexes with CD4 and the appropriate coreceptor. Moreover, the cellular quantities of CD4 and coreceptors were sufficient for efficient infections by the corresponding HIV-1 isolates. In these conditions, the kinetics and affinities of (125)I-gp120 adsorptions and their subsequent metabolisms were strongly dependent on CD4 but were not significantly influenced by CCR5 or CXCR4. After binding to CD4, the (125)I-gp120s slowly became resistant to extraction from the cell monolayers by pH 3.0 buffer, suggesting that they were endocytosed with half-times of 1-2 h. Within 20-30 min of endocytosis, the (125)I-gp120s were proteolytically degraded to small products that were shed into the media. The weak base chloroquine strongly inhibited (125)I-gp120 proteolysis and caused its intracellular accumulation, suggesting involvement of a low pH organelle. Results supporting these methods and conclusions were obtained by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. We conclude that the energetics, kinetics, and pathways of (125)I-gp120 binding, endocytosis, and proteolysis are determined principally by CD4 rather than by coreceptors in cells that contain sufficient coreceptors for efficient infections. Therefore, the role of coreceptors in HIV-1 infections probably does not include steerage or subcellular localization of adsorbed virus."

Seven patients (6.9%) were HBsAg carriers compared with 54 patients (53.5%) who had no evidence of exposure to HBV infection. Twenty-four patients (23.8%) had anti-HBc alone as a serological marker compared with four patients who were positive for anti-HBs alone and 12 patients (11.9%) who were anti-HBc and anti-HBs-positive. Occult HBV infection (presence of HBV DNA in the absence of HBsAg) is found to be relatively high (28.7%) in HIV-infected Lebanese patients and the overwhelming majority (83.3%) of those who were positive for anti-HBc alone had a detectable HBV DNA in their serum. However, none of our HIV-positive patients with occult HBV infection had abnormal alanine aminotransferase level, which also raises the question as to whether occult HBV plays a role in the aetiology of liver disease in HIV-infected patients. Further, studies on the association between HBV DNA levels and markers of liver function in addition to data on liver biopsy would help in answering this question."
4547,0.005,1.0000,"To examine whether cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection could accelerate progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to AIDS, serological studies were done on 108 HIV-infected haemophiliacs. In the 1.3-9 years from time of first recognised HIV seroconversion, the age-adjusted risk of CDC group IV disease in CMV-seropositive patients was 2.5 times that in CMV-seronegative patients. CMV-seropositive patients were also more likely to have detectable p24 antigenaemia. Survival analysis showed that CMV-seropositive patients were at greater risk of HIV disease than CMV-seronegative patients from about 2 years after HIV seroconversion. Thus CMV infection is associated with a more rapid progression to HIV disease."
7573,0.005,1.0000,"It remains unclear how the detection of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) in the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody (anti-HBs) should be interpreted and whether all patients with this pattern need to be tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA. This study aimed at reassessing the significance of 'anti-HBc alone' in unselected sera referred to the clinical laboratory and determining whether significant HBV viraemia can be found in this setting. Of the 6431 patients tested for HBsAg, total anti-HBc and anti-HBs in a Paris hospital over a 1-year period, 362 (5.6%) had 'anti-HBc alone' (24.8% of anti-HBc-positive patients). Only 11 of the 362 sera (3.0%) were found to be false positive. One patient was in the resolving phase of acute hepatitis B. HBV-DNA was detected in 10 of 362 (2.8%) patients, using a commercial standardized assay (threshold: 350 IU/mL). Viral loads exceeded 10(4) copies/mL in 6 of 10 patients. Mutations in the HBsAg immunodominant region were identified in seven of the viraemic patients. HBsAg was detected in only two cases when retested by one of the latest, multivalent assays. Neither human immunodeficiency virus nor hepatitis C virus serostatus distinguished between patients with and without HBV-DNA. In conclusion, 'anti-HBc alone' should be considered a risk marker for a so-called 'false occult' HBV infection with significant viraemia. Indeed, results in this hospital population indicate that a small proportion of patients with 'anti-HBc alone' have high viral loads, revealing the occurrence of infection with HBV mutants that escape detection even by multivalent HBsAg assays."

During a follow-up of 1185 person-years, 80 (20%) patients developed HCC, with an annual incidence of 6.8%. The annual incidence was 2.0% in patients negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV), 6.6% in patients with HBsAg alone, 7.0% in patients with anti-HCV alone and 13.3% in patients co-infected with HBV and HCV. There was a positive linear trend in the annual incidence of HCC among patients without either marker, patients with single viral infection and patients with dual viral infection (P[for trend] < 0.0001). Cox's proportional hazard model indicated that HCV/HBV co-infection [hazard ratio (HR), 6.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.80-22.80], anti-HCV alone (HR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.07-13.07) and HBsAg alone (HR, 4.06; 95% CI, 1.23-13.34) were independently risk factors of HCC.

3943,0.005,1.0000,"There is evidence that the life expectancy (LE) of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, mortality rates in recent years in HIV-positive individuals appear to have remained higher than would be expected based on rates seen in the general population. A low CD4 count, whether due to late HIV diagnosis, late initiation of cART, or incomplete adherence to cART, remains the dominant predictor of LE, and thus the individual's disease stage at initiation of cART (or thereafter) certainly contributes to these higher mortality rates. However, individuals with HIV also tend to exhibit lifestyles and behaviors that place them at increased risk of mortality, particularly from non-AIDS causes. Thus, although mortality rates among the HIV population may indeed remain slightly higher than those seen in the general population, they may be no higher than those seen in a more appropriately matched control group. Thus, further improvements in LE may now only be possible if some of the other underlying issues (for example, modification of lifestyle or behavioral factors) are tackled."

We conducted a cohort study in 36,950 HCV/HIV-coinfected, 276,901 HCV-monoinfected, 95,827 HIV-monoinfected, and 3,110,904 HCV/HIV-uninfected persons within the U.S. Medicaid populations of California, Florida, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania (1999-2005). Incidence rates of hip fracture were lowest among uninfected persons (1.29 events/1,000 person-years), increased with the presence of either HIV infection (1.95 events/1,000 person-years) or HCV infection (2.69 events/1,000 person-years), and were highest among HCV/HIV-coinfected individuals (3.06 events/1,000 person-years). HCV/HIV coinfection was associated with an increased relative hazard (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval; CI]) of hip fracture, compared to HCV-monoinfected (HR, 1.38; 95% CI: 1.25-1.53), HIV-monoinfected (females: HR, 1.76; 95% CI: 1.44-2.16; males: HR, 1.36; 95% CI: 1.20-1.55), and HCV/HIV-uninfected persons (females: HR, 2.65; 95% CI: 2.21-3.17; males: HR, 2.20; 95% CI: 1.97-2.47). HCV monoinfection was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture, compared to uninfected individuals, and the relative increase was highest in the youngest age groups (females, 18-39 years: HR, 3.56; 95% CI: 2.93-4.32; males, 18-39 years: HR, 2.40; 95% CI: 2.02-2.84)."
8865,0.005,1.0000,"The deleterious effect of HIV on the immune system begins at the time of infection. At seroconversion the virologic and immunologic factors that ultimately will dictate the rate of disease progression are believed to be already in place. The concept developed in this paper implies that, to impact significantly on the progression of disease, anti-HIV therapies should be initiated as early as possible in asymptomatic individuals. Published results have shown that combination drug therapies are potent in reducing HIV-1 RNA load in plasma in asymptomatic individuals, and that some HIV-1 immune-based therapies have a positive impact on immunological markers of disease progression, including HIV-1 cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and CD4 percent. The strategy discussed is to test a combination of antiretroviral therapy with HIV-1 immune-based therapy, such as the inactivated HIV-1 immunogen preparation, in asymptomatic individuals. The goal of this combination approach is to overcome the limitations of each therapy alone. Preliminary data suggest that antiretroviral therapy and the HIV-1 Immunogen can be combined with no noticeable interference and/or added toxicity in a broad range of HIV-1-infected individuals. Combining both therapies may enhance and expand the impact on key surrogate markers of disease progression, although they likely achieve this impact through different mechanisms. Thus, the primary question remains: Can these effects be synergistic?"
7719,0.005,1.0000,"Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) remains a leading cause of death for African-American women from 25 to 34 years of age. Depressive symptoms are commonly associated with the diagnosis of AIDS. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is needed for optimal treatment; however, African-American women who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and who experience depressive symptoms have low and/or inconsistent use of HAART. Additionally, behaviors associated with untreated depressive symptoms increase the chances for HIV transmission. Clinicians, therefore, need to recognize both the individual and the contextual factors that influence those seeking treatment for depressive symptoms. The purpose of this article is to gain a better understanding of the factors that shape treatment seeking for depressive symptoms among HIV-positive African-American women, an important variable in secondary HIV prevention. Multi-contextual underpinnings shape this phenomenon; therefore, Bronfenbrenner's ecological framework was used to organize this literature review. Knowledge gained from this paper can support the promotion of health and can prevent or manage depressive symptoms among this vulnerable group."
646,0.005,1.0000,"During the past two decades, great strides have been made in the design of peptidomimetic drugs for the treatment of viral infections, despite the stigma of poor drug-like properties, low oral absorption, and high clearance associated with such compounds. This Account summarizes the progress made toward overcoming such liabilities and highlights the drug discovery efforts that have focused specifically on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors. The arsenal against the incurable disease AIDS, which is caused by HIV infection, includes peptidomimetic compounds that target the virally encoded aspartic protease enzyme. This enzyme is essential to the production of mature HIV particles and plays a key role in maintaining infectivity. However, because of the rapid genomic evolution of viruses, an inevitable consequence in the treatment of all viral infections is the emergence of resistance to the drugs. Therefore, the incomplete suppression of HIV in treatment-experienced AIDS patients will continue to drive the search for more effective therapeutic agents that exhibit efficacy against the mutants raised by the earlier generation of protease inhibitors. Currently, a number of substrate-based peptidomimetic agents that target the virally encoded HCV NS3/4A protease are in clinical development. Mechanistically, these inhibitors can be generally divided into activated carbonyls that are transition-state mimics or compounds that tap into the feedback mode of enzyme-product inhibition. In the HCV field, there is justified optimism that a number of these compounds will soon reach commercialization as therapeutic agents for the treatment of HCV infections. Structural research has guided the successful design of both HIV and HCV protease inhibitors. X-ray crystallography, NMR, and computational studies have provided valuable insight in to the free-state preorganization of peptidomimetic ligands and their enzyme-bound conformation. Researchers have designed a variety of novel bioisosteric replacements of amino acids and short peptides that contain all of the required pharmacophore moieties and play a key role in inducing conformational changes to the overall molecule. The knowledge gained from these studies will undoubtedly guide the future design of therapeutic agents and further contribute to the success of this field."
4618,0.005,1.0000,"Cultured T-lymphoma cell lines H9 and KE37-1 permanently infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1, strain HTLV-III B) were exposed to phosphatidylcholine (PC) and a PC-containing formulation ""Essentiale"" (PC-E). PC and PC-E, but not triglyceride, were found to inhibit growth of virus-infected cells. Additionally, the membrane lipid composition of infected and uninfected H9 cells was investigated upon exposure to PC. The HIV-1-infected cells showed a 25% increase in membrane triglyceride content and a 15% increase in membrane phospholipid saturated fatty acids. In the presence of PC, there is a further increase in triglyceride content up to 180% compared with uninfected control cells, suggesting a possible cause for the selective growth inhibition of HIV-1-infected cells by PC. The PC-E dose range effective in vitro for inhibition of HIV-1-infected cell growth falls within the range that can be reached in vivo. Formulations containing PC are well tolerated by humans and might be applicable at an early stage of HIV-1 infection to reduce the number of virus-producing cells."
4368,0.005,1.0000,"We previously reported that inhibition of endosomal/lysosomal function can dramatically enhance human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectivity, suggesting that under these conditions productive HIV-1 infection can occur via the endocytic pathway. Here we further examined this effect with bafilomycin A1 (BFLA-1) and show that this enhancement of infectivity extends to all HIV-1 isolates tested regardless of coreceptor usage. However, isolate-specific differences were observed in the magnitude of the effect. This was particularly evident in the case of the weakly infectious HIV-1(SF2), for which we observed the greatest enhancement. Using reciprocal chimeric viruses, we were able to determine that both the disproportionate increase in the infectivity of HIV-1(SF2) in response to BFLA-1 and its weak infectivity in the absence of BFLA-1 mapped to its envelope gene. Further, we found HIV-1(SF2) to have lower fusion activity and to be 12-fold more sensitive to the fusion inhibitor T-20 than HIV-1(NL4-3). Proteasomal inhibitors also enhance HIV-1 infectivity, and we report that the combination of a lysosomal and a proteasomal inhibitor greatly enhanced infectivity of all isolates tested. Again, HIV-1(SF2) was unique in exhibiting a synergistic 400-fold increase in infectivity. We also determined that inhibition of proteasomal function increased the infectivity of HIV-1 pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. The evidence presented here highlights the important role of the lysosomes/proteasomes in the destruction of infectious HIV-1(SF2) and could have implications for the development of novel antiviral agents that might take advantage of these innate defenses."
900,0.005,1.0000,"Protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) phosphorylation is involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation processes that are key factors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) regulation in infected monocytic cells. Short-term exposure of the chronically infected promyelocytic OM10 cell line with the PTK inhibitor genistein induced a dose-dependent increase in p24 antigen production in culture supernatants. This induction persisted in the presence of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor, zidovudine, and was associated with an increased transcription of HIV-1 multiply spliced and unspliced RNAs, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism targeting the integrated provirus. Genistein induced cell differentiation, apoptosis, and a G2 arrest in the OM10 cells. Cell differentiation and apoptosis were not directly involved in the observed increase in HIV-1 replication that was closely linked to genistein-induced G2 arrest. Alleviation of the G2 arrest by pentoxyfylline resulted in a concomitant reduction of HIV-1 to baseline replication. Additionally, by flow cytometry, a significant increase in the number of p24 antigen-expressing cells was observed in cells arrested in G2 compared to those located in G1 or S. Tyrosine kinase inhibition was found not to be essential for enhanced viral replication, which seemed to be related to two other properties of genistein, inhibition of topoisomerase II activity and inhibition of phosphotidylinositol turnover. These findings are consistent with the recent observation that HIV-1 Vpr induces viral replication through preventing proliferation of cells by arresting them in G2 of the cell cycle and strongly suggest that manipulation of the cell cycle plays an important role in HIV-1 pathogenesis."
8538,0.005,1.0000,"Enfuvirtide (ENF) is the first of a new class of antiretrovirals (ARVs) known as the HIV fusion inhibitors. Two phase III studies of ENF, TORO 1 and TORO 2, demonstrated that ENF given in combination with optimized background (OB) therapy significantly improved virological response, increased the time to virological failure, and increased CD4-cell count compared with OB alone among highly treatment-experienced patients. The present study investigated the long-term clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of ENF. Outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness were estimated using a Markov model. Viral suppression and immune reconstitution were determined from the outcomes of the clinical trials. Time to immunological failure, time to AIDS-defining event (ADE), and time to death were estimated based on published mathematical models of disease progression. Costs were based on published estimates of the use and costs of ARVs, cost of managing ADEs, and cost of laboratory and other outpatient services. Cost-effectiveness was calculated as the incremental cost per year of life gained, adjusted for quality of life. The combined effects of an increase in CD4 count and delayed time to virological and immunological failure with ENF + OB were predicted to produce a mean life expectancy of 7.4 years from initiation of therapy, which was 1.8 years (1.5 quality-adjusted lifeyears [QALYs]) greater than the life expectancy associated with OB alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness of ENF + OB was estimated to be Dollars 24,604 per QALY. ENF is projected to increase time to immunological failure, delay onset of new AIDS-defining events, and increase life expectancy by more than 1.5 years among treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients. The cost-effectiveness of ENF is comparable to many existing treatment and prevention management strategies for HIV."
4239,0.005,1.0000,"The progressive loss of immunological memory during aging correlates with a reduced proliferative capacity and shortened telomeres of T cells. Growing evidence suggests that this phenotype is recapitulated during chronic viral infection. The antigenic volume imposed by persistent and latent viruses exposes the immune system to unique challenges that lead to host T-cell exhaustion, characterized by impaired T-cell functions. These dysfunctional memory T cells lack telomerase, the protein capable of extending and stabilizing chromosome ends, imposing constraints on telomere dynamics. A deleterious consequence of this excessive telomere shortening is the premature induction of replicative senescence of viral-specific CD8+ memory T cells. While senescent cells are unable to expand, they can survive for extended periods of time and are more resistant to apoptotic signals. This review takes a closer look at T-cell exhaustion in chronic viruses known to cause human disease: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis B/C/D virus (HBV/HCV/HDV), human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus-1/2(HSV-1/2), and Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV). Current literature linking T-cell exhaustion with critical telomere lengths and immune senescence are discussed. The concept that enduring antigen stimulation leads to T-cell exhaustion that favors telomere attrition and a cell fate marked by enhanced T-cell senescence appears to be a common endpoint to chronic viral infections."
1475,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has considerably improved the prognosis of HIV-infected patients. However, prolonged use of HAART has been related to long-term adverse events that can compromise patient health such as HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is consistent evidence for a central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in these pathologies. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have been described to be mainly responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction in adipose tissue and liver although nonnucleoside transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs) have also showed mitochondrial toxicity, which is a major concern for the selection and the long-term adherence to a particular therapy. Several mechanisms explain these deleterious effects of HAART on mitochondria, and evidence points to other mechanisms beyond the ""Pol- γ hypothesis."" HIV infection has also direct effects on mitochondria. In addition to the negative effects described for HIV itself and/or HAART on mitochondria, HIV-infected patients are more prone to develop a premature aging and, therefore, to present an increased oxidative state that could lead to the development of these metabolic disturbances observed in HIV-infected patients.

Occult infection may impact in several different clinical contexts including the risk of HBV transmission with transfusion or transplantation, and endogenous viral reactivation. The gold standard test for detection of occult infection is the amplification of HBV DNA. However, the serological assay for the long-lasting antibody response to the highly immunogenic HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) represents a qualified candidate as a surrogate for DNA amplification, or for increasing overall sensitivity when assessing the risk of occult hepatitis in peripheral blood. The risk of occult hepatitis associated with anti-HBc seropositivity has been demonstrated extensively, and the presence of antibody response to HBc can be considered a sentinel marker of occult HBV infection."

Occult HBV infection is associated with a risk of HBV transmission through blood transfusion, hemodialysis, and liver transplantation. Furthermore, occult HBV infection contributes to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We recently reported the characteristic molecular features of mutations in the preS/S regions among Korean individuals with occult infections caused by HBV genotype C2; the variants of preS and S related to severe liver diseases among chronically infected patients were also responsible for the majority of HBV occult infections. We also reported that HBsAg variants from occult-infected Korean individuals exhibit lower HBsAg secretion capacity but not reduced HBV DNA levels. In addition, these variants exhibit increased ROS-inducing capacity compared with the wild-type strain, linking HBV occult infections to liver cell damage. Taken together, our previous reports suggest the transmission potential of distinct HBV occult infection-related variants in South Korea. "

Occult HBV infection of hemodialysis (HD) patients is informative in terms of virus transmission, reactivation after kidney transplantation, and the progression of liver disease. However, there is little detailed information about occult HBV infection in the context of virus endemicity. We tried to investigate the seroprevalence and clinical features of occult HBV infection in HD patients in HBV-endemic regions. We enrolled a total of 159 HD patients and 121 apparently healthy subjects at Dankook University Hospital and Jeju National University Hospital in Korea. HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Serum levels of HBV DNA were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The seroprevalence of occult HBV infection was 1.3% in HD patients and 2.5% in the healthy controls. This difference was not significant. The HBV load in all subjects with occult infection was <116 copies/mL, and all were positive for IgG anti-HBc, regardless of the presence of anti-HBs. None of the occult HBV-infected subjects were co-infected with HCV. One of the 2 HD patients with occult HBV infection had no history of blood transfusion. In this HBV-endemic region, the seroprevalence of occult HBV infection in HD patients with a very low viral load was not significantly different from that in apparently healthy subjects. "
8821,0.005,1.0000,"Estimates of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection prevalence varies among different studies depending on the prevalence of HBV infection in the study population and on the sensitivity of the assay used to detect HBV DNA. We investigated the prevalence of occult HBV infection in cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplantation in a Brazilian referral center. Frozen liver samples from 68 adults were analyzed using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay for HBV DNA. The specificity of the amplified HBV sequences was confirmed by direct sequencing of the amplicons. The patient population comprised 49 (72.1%) males and 19 (27.9%) females with a median age of 53 years (range=18-67 years). Occult HBV infection was diagnosed in three (4.4%) patients. The etiologies of the underlying chronic liver disease in these cases were alcohol abuse, HBV infection, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Two of the patients with cryptic HBV infection also presented hepatocellular carcinoma. Markers of previous HBV infection were available in two patients with occult HBV infection and were negative in both. In conclusion, using a sensitive nested polymerase chain reaction assay to detect HBV DNA in frozen liver tissue, we found a low prevalence of occult HBV infection in cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplant, probably due to the low prevalence of HBV infection in our population.

Toxicity of current available drugs and inevitable emergence of multi-drug resistant strains makes things worse. In the present study a series of novel Biginelli-type pyrimidine compounds were evaluated as potential anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 agents using green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter single round HIV-1 infection assay. The rate of infected cells was monitored by flowcytometry. The effect of compounds on the cellular proliferation was considered as the cyotoxicity. The anti-HIV-1 active compounds were selected for HIV-1 replication and syncytium formation assays. The antiretroviral activity of compounds was measured against luciferase reporter A murine leukemia virus (AMLV) virions as the retrovirus control. Compounds 2, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 20, and 21 were the most potent against HIV-1. Compound 8 had the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 100 nmol/l for inhibiting HIV-1 replication and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) was up to 100 μmol/l (therapeutic index (TI) >1000). Results show that the active compounds were able to inhibit the retrovirus control as well. Analysis of structure of the studied compounds proved relationships with their anti-HIV-1 effects. Some of the studied compounds seem to be promising anti-HIV-1 drug candidates.

Through further modification of the lead compounds and structure-activity relationship analysis several new TIBO derivatives that show high potency, selectivity, and specificity against HIV-1 have been obtained. A new TIBO derivative, R86183, inhibits the replication of HIV-1, but not HIV-2, in a variety of CD4+ T-cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes, at a concentration of 0.3 to 30 nM, which is at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than the 50% cytotoxic concentration. Whereas an HIV-1 strain containing the Leu-100-->Ile mutation in the RT gene is about 400-fold less susceptible, R86183 still inhibits the replication of an HIV-1 strain containing the Tyr-181-->Cys RT mutation by 50% at a concentration of 130 nM. R86183 inhibits the poly(C).oligo(dG)12-18-directed HIV-1 RT reaction by 50% at a concentration of 57 nM. The antiviral activity of 22 TIBO derivatives in cell culture correlated well with their activity against HIV-1 RT. No such correlation was found for their cytotoxicity. The combination of R86183 with either zidovudine or didanosine resulted in a synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 (strain IIIB) replication. Combination of R86183 with the protease inhibitor Ro31-8959 was found to be additive.

We aimed to investigate the usefulness of HBcrAg measurement for monitoring chronic hepatitis B disease. HBcrAg levels were measured by a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay in 54 untreated patients and 39 patients treated with either entecavir or lamivudine. The HBcrAg concentration correlated positively with the levels of serum HBV DNA (r = 0.820), intrahepatic total HBV DNA (r = 0.700), and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) (r = 0.664; for all, P values were <0.001). A higher HBcrAg concentration was associated with a greater proportion of hepatitis B core antigen immunostaining. Although the differences were not statistically significant, patients with higher Knodell necroinflammation and fibrosis scores tended to have higher serum HBcrAg concentration levels. In the treated patients, the logarithmic reduction in HBcrAg at week 48 correlated positively with the logarithmic reduction of serum HBV DNA, intrahepatic total HBV DNA, and cccDNA. Of the 31 patients with undetectable serum HBV DNA (<300 copies/ml) at the end of treatment, 20 (65%) still had detectable HBcrAg. A greater reduction in posttreatment HBcrAg concentration was associated with histological improvement and a decrease in hepatitis B core antigen immunostaining. HBcrAg concentrations of <40,000 kU/ml at baseline and <200 kU/ml at week 24 were associated with a higher chance of having undetectable HBV DNA at week 48. In conclusion, serum HBcrAg levels correlated with HBV virological markers and reflected the chronic hepatitis B disease activity in the liver."

Previous preclinical research with monkey models suggested that high concentrations and drug combinations are needed for high efficacy. We evaluated two long-acting reverse transcriptase inhibitors, tenofovir (TFV) and emtricitabine (FTC), by using a twice-weekly repeat challenge macaque model and showed that a preexposure vaginal application of gel with 1% TFV alone or in combination with 5% FTC fully protected macaques from a total of 20 exposures to simian-human immunodeficiency virus SF162p3. FTC and TFV were detected in plasma 30 min after vaginal application, suggesting rapid absorption. FTC was detected more frequently than TFV and showed higher levels, reflecting the fivefold-higher concentration of this drug than of TFV. Two of 12 repeatedly exposed but protected macaques showed limited T-cell priming, which did not induce resistance to infection when macaques were rechallenged. Thus, single drugs with durable antiviral activity can provide highly effective topical prophylaxis and overcome the need for noncoital use or for drug combinations which are more complex and costly to formulate and approve."

Serum IL-10 concentration was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The percentages of CD38(+) CD19(+) , CD86(+) CD19(+) , CD38(+) CD86(+) CD19(+) , and CD95(+) CD19(+) B cells were significantly higher in HBV-MN patients than the HBV-IT and HC. The percentages of CD5(+) CD19(+) , IL-10(+) CD19(+) B cells and serum IL-10 level in HBV-MN patients were significantly higher than the HC, and lower than the HBV-IT. Percentages of CD38(+) CD19(+) , and CD86(+) CD19(+) B cells were reduced after treatment, while the percentages of CD5(+) CD1d(+) CD19(+) , CD5(+) CD1d(+) IL-10(+) CD19(+) , and IL-10(+) CD19(+) B cells were increased. The 24 h urinary protein concentration was positively correlated with the percentage of CD38(+) CD19(+) , and negatively correlated with the percentage of IL-10(+) CD19(+) B cells and serum IL-10 level. Similarly, the value of eGFR was negatively correlated with the percentage of CD38(+) CD19(+) , and positively correlated with the percentage of IL-10(+) CD19(+) B cells and serum IL-10 level. Serum IL-10 level and the percentage of IL-10(+) CD19(+) were negatively correlated with the percentages of CD38(+) CD19(+) , and CD86(+) CD19(+) B cells. These results suggest that CD86(+) CD19(+) , CD38(+) CD86(+) CD19(+) , CD95(+) CD19(+) , and especially CD38(+) CD19(+) and IL-10(+) CD19(+) cells may participate in the pathogenesis of HBV-MN. "

Nelfinavir concentrations did not correlate with total daily dose, dose per kilogram of weight, age, weight, previous protease inhibitor (PI) experience, or CD4(+) cell percentage. In the 25 PI-naive children, the virus load reductions at 24 weeks of treatment with the twice- and thrice-daily regimens were comparable. A significantly higher percentage of children in the twice-daily group had a trough concentration of nelfinavir of less than the inhibitory concentration of 95% (P=.042). The decrease in the virus load at 24 weeks of treatment was not correlated with the trough concentration of nelfinavir. The variability of trough concentrations was extremely high, particularly among recipients of the twice-daily regimen, resulting in a higher number of patients with subinhibitory concentrations of nelfinavir in this group."

Eighteen subjects with HIV-1 infection were enrolled based on the use of RAL-containing regimens and the availability of CSF and matched plasma samples. RAL was measured in 21 CSF and plasma pairs by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and HIV RNA was detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). RAL concentrations were compared to the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) for wild-type HIV-1 (3.2 ng/ml). Volunteers were predominantly middle-aged white men with AIDS and without hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. The median concurrent CD4(+) cell count was 276/μl, and 28% of CD4(+) cell counts were below 200/μl. HIV RNA was detectable in 38% of plasma specimens and 4% of CSF specimens. RAL was present in all CSF specimens, with a median total concentration of 14.5 ng/ml. The median concentration in plasma was 260.9 ng/ml, with a median CSF-to-plasma ratio of 0.058. Concentrations in CSF correlated with those in with plasma (r(2), 0.24; P, 0.02) but not with the postdose sampling time (P, >0.50). RAL concentrations in CSF exceeded the IC(50) for wild-type HIV in all specimens by a median of 4.5-fold. RAL is present in CSF and reaches sufficiently high concentrations to inhibit wild-type HIV in all individuals.

A total of 101 HAART-treated HIV-1 infected patients with < or = 200 HIV-RNA copies/ml were followed prospectively for 24 months. HIV-RNA was investigated 3-monthly and 2B4 expression on CD3- CD16+ NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells, proviral-DNA and plasma soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor (sTNFr)-II were investigated 6-monthly. For comparison, 2B4 expression was investigated in 20 healthy individuals. The concentration of 2B4+ NK cells was initially reduced in HIV-1 infected patients (P < 0.001) but increased to a normal level during the 24 months' follow-up. The concentration of CD3+ CD8+ 2B4+ cells in HIV-1 infected patients was normal and did not change during follow-up. The relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of 2B4 increased on both NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells during follow-up (both P < 0.001). Higher levels of proviral-DNA carrying cells and plasma sTNFrII were associated with reductions in the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells (all P < 0.05). HIV-RNA had no effect on 2B4 expression on NK cells or CD3+ CD8+ cells. These findings demonstrate that the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells normalizes during long-term HAART in HIV-1 infected patients. The finding that proviral-DNA and sTNFrII were associated negatively with the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells suggests that immune activation in HIV-1 infected patients receiving HAART influences the target cell recognition by NK cells."
8578,0.005,1.0000,"A randomized double-blind controlled trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of passive immunotherapy in the treatment of symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This trial included 86 symptomatic patients randomized to receive plasma rich in anti-HIV-1 antibody or standard seronegative plasma. Each patient in both groups received a 300-ml infusion every 14 days over a 1-year period, and every 28 days thereafter, in addition to zidovudine and other conventional prophylactic treatments. Plasma donors were selected among symptomless seropositive individuals with a CD4 lymphocyte count > or = 400 x 10(6) cells per liter, a negative p24 antigen assay, and a high concentration of anti-p24 antibody. The plasmas were heat-inactivated before infusion. During the study period (day 28-day 365) scheduled by the protocol, clinical benefit from passive immunotherapy was observed in delaying the appearance of the first AIDS-defining event (P < 0.009) and reducing the cumulative incidence of such events, which was estimated 3-fold higher in the control group compared to the treatment group. Seven deaths occurred in the treatment group vs. 11 in the control group (P = 0.27). A total of 47 patients died or exhibited new AIDS-defining events, 18 in the treatment group and 29 in the control group (P = 0.009). No clinical benefit was observed after the 1-year period with infusions performed every 4 weeks. These results indicate a favorable effect of passive immunotherapy on the evolution of advanced AIDS."

The indinavir concentration and a number of patient characteristics at baseline were tested as risk factors for virological treatment failure (defined as a viral load above 200 copies/ml after 24 weeks of treatment) in univariate and multivariate analyses; 65 patients were included. Virological treatment failure occurred in 36.9% of the patients. Multivariate analysis showed that a low plasma concentration of indinavir (odds ratio 0.1), a high viral load at baseline (odds ratio 2.6) and pretreatment with another protease inhibitor (odds ratio 10.0) were independent factors related to virological treatment failure. Monitoring of indinavir plasma concentrations may be an important tool for the optimization of triple drug combination therapy."
444,0.005,1.0000,Dimerization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease (HIV-1 PR) monomers is an essential prerequisite for viral proteolytic activity and the subsequent generation of infectious virus particles. Disruption of the dimer interface inhibits this activity as does formation of heterodimers between wild-type and defective monomers. A structure-based approach was used to identify amino acid substitutions at the dimer interface of HIV-1 PR that facilitate preferential association of heterodimers and inhibit self-association of the defective monomers. Expression of the designed PR monomers inhibits activity of wild-type HIV-1 PR and viral infectivity when assayed in an ex vivo model system. These results show that it is possible to design PR monomers as macromolecular inhibitors that may provide an alternative to small molecule inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection.
7198,0.005,1.0000,"The protease (PR) from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is essential for viral replication: this aspartyl protease, active only as a dimer, is responsible for cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors (Gag and Gag-Pol), to release the functional mature proteins. In this work, we have studied the structure-function relationships of the HIV PR by combining a genetic test to detect proteolytic activity in Escherichia coli and a bacterial two-hybrid assay to analyze PR dimerization. We showed that a drug-resistant PR variant isolated from a patient receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy is impaired in its dimerization capability and, as a consequence, is proteolytically inactive. We further showed that the polypeptide regions adjacent to the PR coding sequence in the Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor, and in particular, the transframe polypeptide (TF), located at the N terminus of PR, can facilitate the dimerization of this variant PR and restore its enzymatic activity. We propose that the TF protein could help to compensate for folding and/or dimerization defects in PR arising from certain mutations within the PR coding sequence and might therefore function to buffer genetic variations in PR."

Recombinant SIV and HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus, type 1) proteases were purified from bacterial cell lysates by use of sequential steps of ammonium sulfate precipitation and size-exclusion and ion-exchange chromatography. The amino acid composition, amino-terminal sequence, and molecular weight (monomer) of the recombinant SIV-PR were in accord with that of the 99 amino acid polypeptide predicted from the SIVMac-PR nucleotide sequence. The active form of SIV-PR was shown to be dimeric by gel filtration chromatography. Inhibition by pepstatin A, time-dependent inactivation by 1,2-epoxy-3-(4-nitrophenoxy)propane, and pH rate profiles using oligopeptide substrates demonstrated that SIV-PR behaves as an aspartic protease. Recombinant HIV-1 Pr55gag precursor was processed in vitro by SIV-PR and HIV-1 PR with indistinguishable proteolytic patterns upon NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Oligopeptide substrates for HIV-1 PR were found to be suitable substrates for recombinant SIV-PR with the exception of a peptide containing the site identified for p66/p51 cleavage (Phe*Tyr) within HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Several synthetic peptide analogue inhibitors of HIV-1 PR were also potent inhibitors of SIV-PR, indicating that SIV infection in macaques and rhesus monkeys should be useful models for the preclinical evaluation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) therapeutics targeted towards the virally encoded HIV-1 protease."
5377,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral drug therapy and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) both exert selective pressures on human immunodeficiency virus type 1, which influence viral evolution. Compared to chronically infected, antiretroviral-untreated patients, most chronically infected, treated patients with detectable viremia lack a cellular immune response against the Gag 77-85(SL9) epitope but show a new immunodominant response against an epitope in protease PR 76-84. Hence, mutations induced by antiretroviral therapy likely alter the profile of epitopes presented to T cells and thus the direction of the response. The consequences of dual pressures from treatment and CTL need to be considered in monitoring of drug therapy."
1336,0.005,1.0000,"Combination therapy can successfully suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in patients but selects for drug resistance, requiring subsequent resistance-guided therapeutic changes. This report describes the development and validation of a novel assay that offers a uniform method to measure susceptibility to all clinically approved HIV type 1 (HIV-1) drugs targeting reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR), integrase (IN), and viral entry. It is an assay in which the antiviral effect on infection within a single replication cycle is measured in triply transfected U87.CD4.CXCR4.CCR5 cells, based on homologous recombination between patient-derived amplicons and molecular proviral clones tagged with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene and from which certain viral genomic regions are removed. The deletions stretch from p17 codon 7 to PR codon 98 in pNL4.3-DeltagagPR-EGFP, from PR codons 1 to 99 in pNL4.3-DeltaPR-EGFP, from RT codons 1 to 560 in pNL4.3-DeltaRT-EGFP, from IN codons 1 to 288 in pNL4.3-DeltaIN-EGFP, and from gp120 codon 34 to gp41 codon 237 in pNL4.3-Deltaenv-EGFP. The optimized experimental conditions enable the investigation of patient samples regardless of viral subtype or coreceptor use. The extraction and amplification success rate for a set of clinical samples belonging to a broad range of HIV-1 group M genetic forms (A-J, CRF01-03, CRF05, and CRF12-13) and displaying a viral load range of 200 to >500,000 RNA copies/ml was 97%. The drug susceptibility measurements, based on discrimination between infected and noninfected cells on a single-cell level by flow cytometry, were reproducible, with coefficients of variation for resistance ranging from 7% to 31%, and were consistent with scientific literature in terms of magnitude and specificity."
4844,0.005,1.0000,"A major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 infection is the presence of a pool of long-lived, latently infected CD4+ memory T-cells. The search for treatments to re-activate latent HIV to aid in clearance is hindered by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that lead to transcriptional silencing of viral gene expression in host cells. Here we identify a previously unknown role for RUNX1 in HIV-1 transcriptional latency. The RUNX proteins, in combination with the co-factor CBF-β, are critical transcriptional regulators in T-cells. RUNX1 strongly modulates CD4 expression and contributes to CD4+ T-cell function. We show that RUNX1 can bind DNA sequences within the HIV-1 LTR and that this binding represses transcription. Using patient samples we show a negative correlation between RUNX1 expression and viral load. Furthermore, we find that pharmacologic inhibition of RUNX1 by a small molecule inhibitor, Ro5-3335, synergizes with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) to enhance the activation of latent HIV-1 in both cell lines and PBMCs from patients. Our findings indicate that RUNX1 and CBF-β cooperate in cells to modulate HIV-1 replication, identifying for the first time RUNX1 as a cellular factor involved in HIV-1 latency. This work highlights the therapeutic potential of inhibitors of RUNX1 to re-activate virus and aid in clearance of HIV-1. "
5184,0.005,1.0000,"Suboptimal treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) often results in the rapid selection of drug-resistant virus. Several amino acid substitutions at position 190 of reverse transcriptase (RT) have been associated with reduced susceptibility to the NNRTI, especially nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV). In the present study, the effects of various 190 substitutions observed in viruses obtained from NNRTI-experienced patients were characterized with patient-derived HIV isolates and confirmed with a panel of isogenic viruses. Compared to wild-type HIV, which has a glycine at position 190 (G190), viruses with 190 substitutions (A, C, Q, S, V, E, or T, collectively referred to as G190X substitutions) were markedly less susceptible to NVP and EFV. In contrast, delavirdine (DLV) susceptibility of these G190X viruses increased from 3 to 300-fold (hypersusceptible) or was only slightly decreased. The replication capacity of viruses with certain 190 substitutions (C, Q, V, T, and E) was severely impaired and was correlated with reduced virion-associated RT activity and incomplete protease (PR) processing of the viral p55(gag) polyprotein. These defects were the result of inadequate p160(gagpol) incorporation into virions. Compensatory mutations within RT and PR improved replication capacity, p55(gag) processing, and RT activity, presumably through increased incorporation of p160(gagpol) into virions. We observe an inverse relationship between the degree of NVP and EFV resistance and the impairment of viral replication in viruses with substitutions at 190 in RT. These observations may have important implications for the future design and development of antiretroviral drugs that restrict the outgrowth of resistant variants with high replication capacity."
1116,0.005,1.0000,"Anthropometric data were collected on 89 children born to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women (37 who seroreverted and 52 who were HIV-infected). The main outcomes included birth weight, gestational age, weight, height, arm muscle circumference (AMC), and triceps skinfold thickness (TSF). Gestational age and birth weight were not different between the two groups. The earliest anthropometric evaluation on seroreverted children (age 19 mo) when compared with HIV-infected children (age 21 mo) revealed that weight and weight-for-height percentiles were significantly different (51% vs 33% and 66% vs 48%, respectively). Height and TSF percentiles were not different, although AMC percentiles were lower in infected children (64% vs 43%). In follow-up evaluations, the weight differences between infected and control children did not change. We conclude that HIV does not affect birth weight, but postnatal events result in altered weight gain in HIV-infected children. Lean body mass is lower than in an HIV-negative comparison group at early stages of HIV infection."
588,0.005,1.0000,"Quality of life (QOL) domains that are context specific to people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Swaziland are unknown. This presents a problem when research has to be conducted on QOL of PLWHA who are on ART. As a result, this study was conducted to identify, validate and describe domains necessary to assess QOL of PLWHA, who are on ART in Swaziland. A qualitative, explorative, descriptive, and contextual design was used for this study. The first phase dealt with a review of fifty existing QOL definitions and the identification of the common domains amongst them. Findings from this review revealed that the most common domains of QOL are the physiological, psychological, spiritual and socio-economic domains. The second phase was the validation of the above common domains identified from the examined QOL definitions to make them context specific to PLWHA who are on ART in Swaziland. A workshop was used to validate the domains with expert nurses involved in the care of PLWHA in Swaziland. The experts in ART care were trained on ART and had more than a year's experience of working with PLWHA who are on ART. The validation process revealed that the essential context specific domains to consider when assessing QOL of PLWHA who are on ART are, (1) physiological domain, (2) psychological domain, (3) spiritual domain, (4) socio-economic domain, (5) cognitive domain, and (6) environmental domain. The process of validation of the domains was important as two extra domains were revealed, which were not initially recognised by the researcher during literature review."
7580,0.005,1.0000,"The present study was designed to assess the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among hospital employees, who often contract the infection before the beginning of their employment, and to suggest a prevention strategy. The study population consisted of 2518 subjects working or studying at the two Hadassah University hospitals, on Mount Scopus and at Ein Kerem in Jerusalem. The total prevalence for anti-HBc positivity as an indicator for past or present HBV infection was 17.6%. Several variables, including country of birth, age, and duration of employment significantly affected the rate of anti-HBc positivity. The highest rates for anti-HBc+ were found in personnel of selected departments such as haemodialysis (31.8%), haematology/oncology (28.3%), and the blood bank (24.0%), after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex. Specific occupations in the hospital were associated with an increased rate of anti-HBc positivity. Thus the highest rate of HBV infection (after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex) was shown for housekeepers (32.4%) and departmental secretaries (23.6%), who take care of waste products containing blood, or who transfer vials containing blood to the hospital laboratories. By comparison, anti-HBc was positive in 17.2% of nurses, 15.6% of physicians, and only 7.8% of administrative clerks. Israel is a country of immigration, and anti-HBc rates were four times higher in employees born in countries where HBV is more endemic--for example, in north Africa and Mediterranean countries--than in employees born in western Europe or the United States. However, rate of anti-HBc + increased significantly with age as well as duration of employment in the hospital, irrespective of country of birth. These data indicate that although HBV infection often occurs in Israel before commencement of employment in the hospital, hospital employees are at significant risk for contracting HBV infection during their professional lifetime regardless of where they were born. Moreover, paramedical personnel such as housekeepers and departmental secretaries are in the highest risk group for contracting HBV. Finally, as a result of the high background of anti-HBC positivity in selected ethnic groups, mandatory screening for anti-HBc before employment in medical institutions in Israel is recommended for them, then active vaccination against HBV for employees at risk. Employees who immigrated from western Europe and the United States should be immunised without pre-vaccination screening for HBV."
7648,0.005,1.0000,"A broad Gag-specific CD8(+) T-cell response is associated with effective control of adult human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The association of certain HLA class I molecules, such as HLA-B*57, -B*5801, and -B*8101, with immune control is linked to mutations within Gag epitopes presented by these alleles that allow HIV to evade the immune response but that also reduce viral replicative capacity. Transmission of such viruses containing mutations within Gag epitopes results in lower viral loads in adult recipients. In this study of pediatric infection, we tested the hypothesis that children may tend to progress relatively slowly if either they themselves possess one of the protective HLA-B alleles or the mother possesses one of these alleles, thereby transmitting a low-fitness virus to the child. We analyzed HLA type, CD8(+) T-cell responses, and viral sequence changes for 61 mother-child pairs from Durban, South Africa, who were monitored from birth. Slow progression was significantly associated with the mother or child possessing one of the protective HLA-B alleles, and more significantly so when the protective allele was not shared by mother and child (P = 0.007). Slow progressors tended to make CD8(+) T-cell responses to Gag epitopes presented by the protective HLA-B alleles, in contrast to progressors expressing the same alleles (P = 0.07; Fisher's exact test). Mothers expressing the protective alleles were significantly more likely to transmit escape variants within the Gag epitopes presented by those alleles than mothers not expressing those alleles (75% versus 21%; P = 0.001). Reversion of transmitted escape mutations was observed in all slow-progressing children whose mothers possessed protective HLA-B alleles. These data show that HLA class I alleles influence disease progression in pediatric as well as adult infection, both as a result of the CD8(+) T-cell responses generated in the child and through the transmission of low-fitness viruses by the mother."
9613,0.005,1.0000,"Vertical transmission of Hepatitis B virus HBV can result in a state of chronic HBV infection and its complications. HBV vaccination with or without hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) prevents transmission of overt infection to the babies. However, whether it also prevents occult HBV infection in babies is not known. Consecutive pregnant women of any gestation found to be HBsAg positive were followed till delivery, and their babies were included in the study. Immediately after delivery, babies were randomized to receive either HBIG or placebo in addition to recombinant HBV vaccine (at 0, 6, 10 and 14 weeks). The primary end-point of the study, assessed at 18 weeks of age, was remaining free of any HBV infection (either overt or occult) plus the development of adequate immune response to vaccine. The babies were further followed up for a median of 2 years of age to determine their eventual outcome. Risk factors for HBV transmission and for poor immune response in babies were studied. Of the 283 eligible babies, 259 were included in the trial and randomized to receive either HBIG (n=128) or placebo (n=131) in addition to recombinant HBV vaccine. Of the 222 of 259 (86%) babies who completed 18 weeks of follow-up, only 62/222 (28%) reached primary end-point. Of the remaining, 6/222 (3%) developed overt HBV infection, 142/222 (64%) developed occult HBV infection, and 12/222 (5%) had no HBV infection but had poor immune response. All 6 overt infections occurred in the placebo group (P=0.030), while occult HBV infections were more common in the HBIG group (76/106 [72%] vs. 66/116 [57%]; P=0.025). This may be due to the immune pressure of HBIG. There was no significant difference between the two groups in frequency of babies developing poor immune response or those achieving primary end-point. The final outcome of these babies at 24 months of age was as follows: overt HBV infection 4%, occult HBV infection 42%, no HBV infection but poor immune response 8% and no HBV infection with good immune response 28%. Women who were anti-HBe positive were a low-risk group, and their babies were most likely to remain free of HBV infection (occult or overt) and had good immune response to the vaccine. Maternal HBeAg-positive status and negativity for anti-HBe predicted not only overt but also any infection (both overt and occult) in babies. In addition, high maternal HBV DNA and treatment with vaccine alone were significant factors for overt HBV infection in babies. The current practice of administration of vaccine with HBIG at birth to babies born of HBsAg-positive mothers is not effective in preventing occult HBV infection in babies, which may be up to 40%. Because the most important risk factors for mother-to-baby transmission of HBV infection are the replicative status and high HBV DNA level in mothers; it will be worthwhile investigating the role of antivirals and HBIG administration during pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HBV infection."
6194,0.005,1.0000,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is thought to be involved in the pathogenic and metabolic events associated with HIV-1 infection. We assessed whether carriage of the TNF-α gene promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with lipodystrophy and metabolic derangements in HIV-1-infected patients treated with cART. We also assessed variations in TNF-α receptor plasma levels. The study group comprised 286 HIV-1-infected patients (133 with and 153 without lipodystrophy) and 203 uninfected controls (UC). TNF-α -238G > A, -308G > A, and -863 C > A SNP were assessed using PCR-RFLPs on white cell DNA. Plasma sTNF-α R1 and R2 levels were measured by ELISA. Student's t test, the χ(2) test, Pearson correlations, and the logistic regression test were performed for statistical analysis. The TNF-α -308G > A SNP was significantly associated with lipodystrophy in the univariate analysis (p = 0.04). This association, however, was no longer significant in the multivariate analysis. A meta-analysis of the published literature and our own data, which included 284 patients with lipodystrophy and 338 without lipodystrophy, showed that there was no relationship between the TNF-α -238G > A and -308G > A SNP and lipodystrophy (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). HIV-1-infected patients had greater sTNF-α R2 plasma levels than UC (p = 0.001) whereas sTNF-α R1 and R2 levels were not significantly different in both the HIV-1-infected cohorts, lipodystrophy vs. nonlipodystrophy (p = NS). In our cohort of white Spaniards the TNF-α -238G > A, -308G > A, and -863C > A SNP were not associated with lipodystrophy in HIV-1-infected patients treated with cART. This finding was replicated in a meta-analysis of the published data, which showed no associations between the TNF-α -238G > A and -308G > A SNP and lipodystrophy. In HIV-1-infected patients under cART there is a systemic overproduction of sTNF-α R2, which is unrelated to the presence of lipodystrophy."

To investigate the associations of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10204525, rs2227982 and rs36084323) in PD-1 and a previously well-inquired SNP rs12979860 in IL-28B with the outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Southeast China, a total of 375 healthy controls, 219 spontaneous resolved HCV patients and 600 chronic HCV patients were enrolled in this study. The generation of HCV F protein and PD-1 expression on T cells was determined. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed no association of rs12979860 CC genotype with spontaneous clearance of HCV infection in our subjects. The generation of HCV F protein was significantly related to HCV infection chronicity, but no significant relationship was found between HCV F protein and SNPs in PD-1. The rs10204525 TT genotype was associated with an increased risk of HCV infection chronicity in age ⩽56years subgroup (adjusted OR=0.390, P=3.8×10(-4)). The C allele of rs10204525 played protective roles in females infected with HCV (adjusted OR=0.608, P=0.008). A significant higher percentage of PD-1 expression on T cells was observed in rs10204525 TT genotype when compared to CC genotype (P=0.047). Moreover, a significant genotype-genotype interaction between IL-28B rs12979860 CC and PD-1 rs10204525 TC+CC was found to be associated with higher rates of spontaneous clearance (adjusted OR=0.689, P=0.032). The combined effect of rs12979860 and rs10204525 was of great value in predicting the outcomes of HCV infection. These analyses showed the importance of IL-28B and PD-1 polymorphisms and their interactions in the outcomes of HCV infection in Chinese Han population in Southeast China."

Using a counting-process formulation of the Cox model, we analyzed observation time in these 2 groups for persons who were prescribed antiretroviral therapy but not prophylaxis. The incidences of the infections were low for patients whose CD4(+) count rose above the threshold of risk (PCP, 0.6 cases per 100 person-years [PY]; MAC, 1. 0 cases per 100 PY) and not higher than in persons whose CD4(+) counts had not decreased below these thresholds, which suggests that discontinuation of primary prophylaxis for opportunistic infections may be considered for some patients."
7231,0.005,1.0000,"Recent genome-wide association studies report that the SNP rs8099917, located 8.9 kb upstream of the start codon of IL28B, is associated with both disease chronicity and therapeutic response to pegIFN-α and RBV in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. To determine the effect of rs8099917 variation on the response of HCV to therapy, we genotyped this variant in a cohort of 160 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients in our clinic unit who received combined peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy. The rs8099917 T/G or G/G genotypes were observed in 56 patients (35%). Treatment failure occurred in 80% of G-allele carriers versus 48% of non-carriers (P<0.0001). This result reveals that the G allele was strongly associated with treatment failure in this patient cohort. Importantly, a highly significant association was found between the G-allele and response to therapy in HCV genotype 1-infected patients (P<0.0001) but not in HCV genotype 3-infected patients. Multivariate analysis (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval; P value) indicated that the rs8099917 TT genotype was a strong predictor of treatment success (5.83; 1.26-26.92; P = 0.021), independent of baseline plasma HCV-RNA load less than 500 000 IU/ml (4.85; 1.18-19.95; P = 0.025) and absence of advanced liver fibrosis (5.24; 1.20-22.91; P = 0.025). These results reveal the high prevalence of the rs8099917 G allele in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients as well as its strong association with treatment failure in HCV genotype 1-infected patients. rs8099917 SNP genotyping may be a valid pre-treatment predictor of which patients are likely to respond to treatment in this group of difficult-to-treat HCV/HIV-infected patients."
1956,0.005,1.0000,"Accurate determination of plasma human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels is critical for the effective management of HIV-1 disease. The AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Test, a reverse transcription-PCR-based test for quantification of HIV-1 RNA in plasma, was developed when little sequence information on HIV-1 isolates from outside North America was available. It has since become apparent that many non-subtype B isolates, particularly subtypes A and E, are detected inefficiently by the test. We describe here the AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Test, version 1.5, an upgraded test developed to minimize subtype-related variation. We also developed a panel of HIV-1 standards containing 30 HIV-1 isolates of subtypes A through G. The virus particle concentration of each cultured viral stock was standardized by electron microscopic virus particle counting. We used this panel to determine the performance of the original AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Test and version 1.5 of the test with HIV-1 subtypes A through G. The original test underestimated the concentration of HIV-1 subtype A, E, F, and G RNA by 10-fold or more, whereas version of the 1.5 test yielded equivalent quantification of HIV-1 RNA regardless of the subtype. In light of the increasing intermixing of HIV-1 subtypes worldwide, standardization of PCR-based tests against well-characterized viral isolates representing the full range of HIV-1 diversity will be essential for the continued utility of these important clinical management tools."

DNA samples from this patient were subjected to end-point PCR amplification of the LTR region. Clones were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. All clones were subtype A related, and four presented an insertion, corresponding to an extra NF-kappaB site. This is the first confirmed case report of an HIV-2-infected subject identified in Brazil whose transmission occurred within the country. Furthermore, the NF-kappaB duplication would potentially be associated with an increase in viral cytopathogenicity. This raises concern for the need for permanent monitoring of the spread of HIV-2 in different areas of the world, even considering its lower rate of transmission and pathogenicity when compared to HIV-1."

The participants were 60 female outpatients of the referred service. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews. The women's mean age was 39.8 (standard deviation of 9.1) years; most of the women had a low education level, lived in deprived socioeconomic conditions, and were in a stable relationship. The most frequent form of infection was through a heterosexual relationship; 55% of the women had abandoned treatment, and their main reasons were the imposed therapeutic schemes, the side effects of antiretroviral drugs, coping with the disease, and the perspective of imminent death; 35% did not meet the adherence criteria, considered as taking 95% of the prescribed antiretroviral therapy."
3518,0.005,1.0000,"The surveillance of the epidemic of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United Kingdom is described. Up to 30 September 1987, 1067 cases meeting the World Health Organization/Centers for Disease Control (U.S.A.) definition of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported in the U.K. Of these, 49 were in persons who came to the U.K. for diagnosis and treatment and 1018 were in U.K. residents. There were 7561 laboratory reports of HIV antibody-positive tests in the same period. The main epidemic continued among homosexuals and bisexuals, principally in the four Thames National Health Service (NHS) regions. Laboratory reports of new HIV antibody-positive tests also increased, but the rise was more erratic. For example, a sharp rise in the last quarter of 1986 and the first quarter of 1987 was probably due to a substantial rise in testing which followed the Government publicity campaigns and may not, therefore, necessarily indicate an increasing incidence. AIDS in haemophiliacs increased but new HIV antibody-positive reports declined after the introduction of control measures in 1985. The epidemic increased in intravenous (IV) drug abusers. Although only 32 cases of AIDS were reported, the increase in the number of laboratory reports of HIV antibody-positive tests, particularly in Scotland, suggests that reports of AIDS will increase in this group in the next few years. Heterosexual spread of infection took place but most infections were acquired in sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, five cases of AIDS and at least 16 HIV antibody-positive tests were in persons infected in the U.K. in whom neither they nor their sexual partners had recognised risk factors. Furthermore, it is possible that some of the infections in IV drug abusers were heterosexually acquired. The epidemic of AIDS in the U.K. continues to increase exponentially, new reports of AIDS cases doubling every 10 to 11 months. If this continues there are likely to be about 1700 new cases reported in the 15 months following September 1987, leading to an estimated cumulative total of over 2500 reported cases in U.K. residents by December 1988."
7169,0.005,1.0000,"Five hundred ninety students receiving primary care in a university health service were surveyed anonymously in 1985-86 to study their self-reported sexual behavior and knowledge and attitudes about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Most students (75%) were heterosexual; 3% were homosexual, 3% bisexual, and 15% had never been sexually active. Many students (32%) had greater than or equal to 2 sexual partners in the past year, but only 23% of these had changed their sexual practices because of concern about AIDS. Some students with high-risk sexual behavior were not very knowledgeable: among homosexual or bisexual men, those with greater than or equal to 6 recent sexual partners knew less than others (P less than 0.001). Overall, less knowledgeable students had more personal concerns about AIDS, favored limiting the social activities of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and favored screening for HIV-antibody; these associations between knowledge and attitudes were significant even when controlling for demographic characteristics and sexual behavior with multiple linear regression. The authors conclude that many students receiving primary care reported sexual behavior that could spread HIV, and that less knowledgeable students had particular concerns and attitudes about AIDS."
9035,0.005,1.0000,"The changing pattern of HIV infection in the UK includes an increase in the number of infections acquired as a result of heterosexual contact and Black African individuals represent a sizeable proportion of those affected. In most UK centres for the treatment of HIV infection, clinicians have limited experience in caring for Black African patients, and there is a dearth of information about the recognition and management of mental health problems in this patient group. In this investigation the proportion of Black African individuals looked after in a large centre for the care of HIV infection in London was compared with the proportion of such patients referred for specialist mental health help, the results revealing that Black Africans were almost three times less likely to be referred for specialist mental health care. A case control investigation of those referred to mental health services showed that Black Africans were more likely to be suffering from AIDS at the time of referral, be referred for assessment of possible organic brain disease, and more likely to be found to be suffering from major depression or organic brain disease. Reasons for the lesser likelihood of referral to the mental health service are considered, including the possible failure of staff to recognize psychological morbidity in Black Africans, or reluctance and fear on the part of patients to be referred to services that may be perceived as threatening."
4724,0.005,1.0000,"Knowledge about epidemiological distribution patterns of HIV infection in different geographic regions is relevant to understand the dynamics of the disease in Brazil. This study aims to characterize the epidemiological and clinical profile of HIV-infected patients from Southwestern Goias State, from 2005 to 2015. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect clinical-epidemiological, virological, and immunological data from the medical records of all HIV-infected patients (n=539) who were followed at the regional reference center of Jatai, Goias State, Brazil, from 2005 to 2015. We detected the prevalence of male patients and the heterosexual route of transmission, as well as an expressive number of young women infected with HIV. The HIV infection was more prevalent in reproductive ages (55.3%). Most patients presented clinical manifestations related to HIV infection at the time of diagnosis. Twenty-four patients presented coinfection with hepatitis C virus, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, leprosy or Chagas disease. Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii was the most common opportunistic infection, followed by neurotoxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and neurocryptococcosis. Combined antiretroviral therapy improved CD4+ T-cell counts: the mean CD4+ T-cell counts after treatment was twice as high as those found at the first medical appointment; and highly active antiretroviral therapy promoted viral suppression in a significant number of patients. Considering the increasing distribution of HIV infection to the interior of Brazil, this descriptive study outlines the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of HIV infection in Southwestern Goias and contributes to develop local prevention strategies and public service plans."
5187,0.005,1.0000,"During the past decade, AIDS has become a global health problem with 182,000 cases reported from 152 countries. It is estimated that nearly five to ten million people are infected worldwide with the etiologic agent of AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). With a mean incubation period from time of infection to the development of AIDS of eight to ten years, it is projected that nearly all HIV-1-infected individuals will develop AIDS within the next 15 years. In the United States alone, 104,210 cases of AIDS and more than 61,000 deaths have been reported. Sexual, parenteral, and perinatal transmission routes have remained the major modes of transmission, although the proportion of cases within each risk behavior category has changed. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion of patients with AIDS who have acknowledged either IV drug use or heterosexual contact with other individuals at high risk for HIV infection. Inner-city minority populations are disproportionately represented among AIDS patients, and HIV-seroprevalence studies demonstrate significantly higher rates of infection among blacks and Hispanics compared with whites, even within the same risk category. In 1988, the US Public Health Service estimated that approximately 1.0 to 1.5 million Americans were currently infected with HIV-1 and that by the end of 1992, a cumulative total of 380,000 cases of AIDS will be diagnosed. In 1992, 80,000 cases of AIDS may be diagnosed, with 66,000 deaths occurring during that year alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5296,0.005,1.0000,"In September 2015, the World Health Organization updated their guidelines to recommend antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all people living with HIV. Countries are now in the process of implementing strategies to provide universal HIV treatment. We analyzed the rate of retention and time to ART eligibility (according to 2013 WHO guidelines) among 3,345 adult patients receiving positive HIV test results between February 1, 2003 and March 31, 2013 at the GHESKIO Clinic in Haiti, with WHO stage 1 or 2 disease and initial CD4 cell count >500 cells/mm3. Among the 3,345 patients, 2,423 (72%) were female, the median age was 33 years, 3,089 (92%) lived in Port-au-Prince, and 1,944 (58%) had attended no school or primary school only. The median initial CD4 cell count was 668 cells/mm3 (IQR: 572-834); over the subsequent 2 years, 1,485 patients (44%) were lost to follow-up and 7 (<1%) died pre-ART, 1,041 (31%) were retained in pre-ART care, and 819 (24%) initiated ART. In multivariate analysis, secondary education (aOR 1.27; 95% CI: 1.10-1.47), female gender (aOR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.09-1.50), co-habitation (aOR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.09-1.57), and residence in Port-au-Prince (aOR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.09-1.88) were associated with retention in care. The median time from baseline CD4 count to ART eligibility was 1.7 years. Prior to the implementation of universal treatment, pre-ART attrition was high among patients who did not qualify for ART at presentation. Though implementing WHO recommendations for universal ART will require service expansion, it will likely result in improved retention for those at risk of being lost to follow-up."
8775,0.005,1.0000,"Leptin, adiponectin and IL18 are adipokines related with obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in the general population. Treated HIV-1-infected patients with lipodystrophy may develop insulin resistance and proatherogenic dyslipidemia. We assessed the relationship between plasma adipokine levels, adipokine genetics, lipodystrophy and metabolic disturbances. Plasma leptin, adiponectin and IL18 levels were assessed in 446 individuals: 282 HIV-1-infected patients treated with antiretroviral drugs (132 with lipodystrophy and 150 without) and 164 uninfected controls (UC). The LEP2410A>G, LEPRQ223R, ADIPQ276G>T, ADIPOR2-Intron5A>G and IL18-607C>A polymorphisms were validated by sequencing. Leptin levels were higher in UC than in HIV-1-infected, either with or without lipodystrophy (p<0.001 for both comparisons) and were lower in patients with lipodystrophy compared with those without lipodystrophy (p=0.006). In patients with lipodystrophy, leptin had a positive correlation with insulin and with HOMA-IR. Adiponectin levels were non-significantly different in UC and HIV-1-infected patients. Patients with lipodystrophy had lower adiponectin levels than non-lipodystrophy subjects (p<0.001). In patients with lipodystrophy, adiponectin was negatively correlated with insulin, HOMA-IR and triglycerides. Plasma IL18 levels were higher in HIV-1-infected patients compared with UC (p<0.001), and no differences were found according to the presence of lipodystrophy. In patients with lipodystrophy there was a negative correlation between IL18 levels and LDLc. Genetic analyses indicated no significant associations with lipodystrophy nor with insulin resistance or with lipid abnormalities. In conclusion, HIV-1-infected patients have reduced plasma leptin levels. This reduction is magnified in patients with lipodystrophy whose adiponectin levels were lower than that of non-lipodystrophy subjects. Plasma IL18 levels are increased in infected patients irrespective of the presence of lipodystrophy. The polymorphisms assessed are not associated with lipodystrophy or metabolic disturbances in treated HIV-1-infected patients."

This was a cross-sectional study. Two hundred twenty-seven HIV-infected patients were evaluated during a single outpatient visit to the General Clinical Research Center of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Usual dietary intake and physical activity habits were evaluated; the Mediterranean Diet Score (MedDietScore) was calculated. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, computed tomographic findings, anthropometrics, and data from the study interviews and questionnaires were used for the assessment of body composition using specific criteria. A complete metabolic profile was available for all subjects. In the entire study sample, a weak inverse association was found between insulin resistance, estimated using the homeostasis model assessment, and MedDietScore (standardized beta = -0.15, P = .03). Interaction models revealed that this was largely driven by an inverse association in patients with FR (standardized beta = -0.13, P = .02). Moreover, MedDietScore was positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (standardized beta = 0.15, P = .01) and marginally negatively associated with circulating triglyceride levels (standardized beta = -0.16, P = .13) in this group of patients. Adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern was favorably related to cardiovascular risk factors in HIV-positive patients with FR. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm our data in different populations and to explore the underlying mechanisms."

Herein, we investigated the actions of insulin using ex vivo and in vivo models of HAND. Increased neuroinflammatory gene expression was observed in brains from patients with HIV/AIDS. The insulin receptor was detected on both neurons and glia, but its expression was unaffected by HIV-1 infection. Insulin treatment of HIV-infected primary human microglia suppressed supernatant HIV-1 p24 levels, reduced CXCL10 and IL-6 transcript levels, and induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) expression. Insulin treatment of primary human neurons prevented HIV-1 Vpr-mediated cell process retraction and death. In feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infected cats, daily intranasal insulin treatment (20.0 IU/200 μl for 6 weeks) reduced CXCL10, IL-6, and FIV RNA detection in brain, although PPAR-γ in glia was increased compared with PBS-treated FIV"

We assessed the impact of antiviral treatment on non invasive serological markers of liver fibrosis in HIV-HCV co-infected patients who received 48-weeks of HCV treatment. In HIV-HCV co-infected patients, HCV clearance was associated with a significant reduction in non invasive fibrosis serological markers, which most likely reflect the histological improvement associated with sustained virologic response. We assessed the association between insulin resistance, liver fibrosis, and liver steatosis in HIV-HCV and HCV-infected patients. Insulin resistance was associated with liver fibrosis and steatosis in HCV mono-infected but not in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Significant liver fibrosis was associated with insulin resistance independent of liver steatosis only in HCV mono-infected patients. We also assessed the impact of insulin resistance on the response to HCV therapy in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. A high HOMA-IR level was frequently found in HIV-HCV co-infected patients and was associated with a reduced sustained virologic response rate. Improving insulin sensitivity may be a useful adjunct to HCV therapy in HIV-HCV co-infected patients."

We performed an observational study in which efavirenz was substituted for a PI for 41 patients receiving HAART who had prolonged virus suppression, clinical signs of severe lipoatrophy, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Clinical follow-up was performed for 1 year. Virus suppression was maintained in most of the patients, and a significant increase in CD4(+) lymphocyte count was observed, but no change in lipid profile or insulin resistance was observed. Abdominal fat content did not change, and subcutaneous fat depletion was even more pronounced >1 year after the switch. We conclude that, for PI-treated patients who present with lipoatrophy, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance, substituting efavirenz for PIs can maintain virus suppression and immunologic response to HAART, but it does not improve the lipid profile or resolve insulin resistance or lipoatrophy."

Five subgroups (truck drivers, female-sex-workers, university students, health service providers, and residents along Chad-Cameroon petroleum pipeline) were targeted in 2004. Potential participants were approached at their geographically diverse areas and consented to participate in the study. Anonymous blood samples were collected. 4,011 participants were surveyed (35% students, 25% sex-workers, 20% pipeline residents, 12.5% health service providers, 7.5% truck drivers). HIV prevalence was highest among sex-workers [26.4%, (95% CI, 23.6-29.2)], pipeline residents [19.9% (95% CI, 17.1-22.7)] and truck drivers [16.3% (95% CI, 12.3-20.9)] and lowest among health service providers [5.2% (95% CI, 3.4-7.5)] and university students [3.8% (95% CI, 2.9-5.0)]. Risky sexual behaviours were practiced in all subpopulations. Multivariable analysis shows in female-sex-workers that; older age, residing in the grassland region (Northwest and West Provinces) and inconstant condom use were significantly associated with HIV infection. Despite a moderate HIV prevalence in the general Cameroonian population, some subgroups are at much higher risk for HIV transmission and practicing risky sexual behaviours.

Specimens should be transported to the laboratory in plastic bags labeled with an easily recognized biohazard warning. Placing patients in private rooms is unnecessary unless a patient has an additional illness that requires such an arrangement. Disinfection, sterilization, housekeeping, and waste management must be done according to recommended guidelines. Asymptomatic hospital personnel with HIV antibody can safely engage in direct patient care. Routine HIV serologic screening of personnel or patients is not recommended. Counseling and HIV antibody testing should be offered to pregnant high-risk women.

Therefore, for the first time, the present study was carried out to investigate the molecular epidemiology, phylogeny and population dynamics of HBV based on 146 HBV-infected patients. A 435-bp portion of the HBV S region was sequenced, and the phylogeny was reconstructed, indicating that three genotypes, B, C and D of HBV were distributed in Dianjiang County. The predominant genotype is B (67.12 %), followed by C (32.19 %) and D (0.68 %). Patient demographic information and clinical outcomes were examined by genotypes, and no significant association was found. Population dynamics analysis suggested that both genotype B and C have experienced a tenfold expansion during the last five years for reasons that are unclear. Thus, a thorough molecular epidemiology investigation is strongly recommended in the future. "
35,0.005,1.0000,"Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is suppressed in asymptomatic HIV-1 carriers (ACs). By using an in vitro experimental system, the mechanism of this suppression was investigated. Following in vitro infection of a laboratory HIV-1 strain, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of ACs transiently supported a low level of viral replication, then the virus production rapidly decreased. PCR analysis revealed that HIV-1 proviral DNA integrated in the PBMC of ACs following infection gradually decreased. Such tapering consequences of in vitro HIV-1 infection in the PBMC of ACs were abrogated by depletion of CD8+ T cells from the culture. Furthermore, the viruses subsequently produced by the PBMC of an AC were less able to replicate than the virus produced by CD8+ cell-depleted PBMC of the same donor. These observations suggested that the CD8+ T cell-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication in ACs may involve both cytocidal and cytostatic mechanisms: the former kills the cells producing viruses, and the latter inhibits viral spread by reducing viral infectivity."

Brain imaging revealed bilateral intraparenchymal ring-enhancing lesions and enhancement of the right optic nerve. Serological findings were positive for venereal disease research laboratory test, whereas the cerebrospinal fluid venereal disease research laboratory test was nonreactive. Brain biopsy suggested a diagnosis of syphilitic cerebral gummata, and the patient's improvement with penicillin and dexamethasone further supported this etiology. Syphilitic cerebral gummata have rarely been reported in patients with HIV infection. This patient demonstrates that cerebral gummata should be considered in the differential diagnosis in immunocompromised patients with characteristic brain masses, that HIV and syphilis often coexist with early neurosyphilis appearing more frequently in this patient population and that normal cerebrospinal fluid studies may not represent a true lack of syphilitic activity in HIV patients."
7211,0.005,1.0000,"The general methods used for public health surveillance of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases and of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are no different from those used for other diseases and infections. However, the methods used must be adapted to the unique epidemiology, wide variation in prevalences, and the very long incubation period of HIV infections. In addition, the severity of AIDS and the extreme social and personal implications of identifying HIV-infected persons make surveillance of AIDS cases and HIV infections much more difficult and place paramount importance on issues such as anonymity and confidentiality. Information on the occurrence of AIDS cases is essential for planning and developing the clinical and laboratory facilities needed for treatment and care of patients with the disease. However, surveillance of AIDS cases is of limited value for assessing the magnitude and future trends of the pandemic because the number of such cases detected, diagnosed, and reported reflect HIV infections that were acquired many years previously. In addition, there are significant problems associated with the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of most AIDS case-reporting systems. Routine HIV surveillance systems are being developed worldwide. Such systems must be adapted to the prevailing epidemiological situation; and the sampling methods used in populations where the prevalence of infection is very low must necessarily differ from those where it is moderate to high. Large-scale population serosurveys are very costly, and the results from such surveys may also be of limited accuracy because of serious problems of selection and participation bias.

To investigate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in patients with HIV, we conducted a retrospective observational analysis using the clinical database of a large centre (Institute of Tropical Medicine) in the urban area of Antwerp, Belgium. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease among HIV infected subjects was found to be 3.0%. The development of chronic kidney disease was associated with age above 50 years, lower CD4 cell counts and Caucasian origin.

In India, which has the third largest HIV epidemic in the world, little is understood about the impact of psychosocial conditions on people living with HIV (PLHIV). We aimed to understand the prevalence and correlates of psychosocial conditions among PLHIV entering into HIV care at the Y.R. Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education in Chennai, India. Thirteen questions were added to the standard voluntary counseling and testing questionnaire, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (a depression scale) and questions assessing for CSA and IPV. We fitted logistic regression models, stratified by gender, with psychosocial condition as the outcome of interest and substance use variables and socio-demographic variables as the correlates of interest. Three hundred and eighty-three persons were enrolled into the study; of these, 253 (66%) tested positive for HIV, including 149 men and 104 women, and were included in the models. More than one-quarter (28%) of the men and 19% of the women reported at least one psychosocial condition (probable depression, CSA, or IPV). In adjusted analysis, current alcohol use was associated with greater than two times higher odds of a psychosocial condition (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.24, 95% CI, 1.04-4.85) among men. In conclusion, we estimated the prevalence of probable depression, CSA, and IPV among PLHIV presenting for HIV care in southern India and found that, among male PLHIV, alcohol use was associated with a markedly higher odds of reporting a psychosocial condition. Further study is needed to characterize alcohol use among male PLHIV and the possible deleterious impact of psychosocial conditions and alcohol use on HIV-related outcomes in India."

Hepatitis C surveillance data was adjusted for death, out-migration, under-diagnosis, and undetectable blood RNA, to estimate prevalence in New York City (NYC). The prevalence of hepatitis C infection in adults aged ⩾20 years in NYC is 2·37% (range 1·53-4·90%) or 146 500 cases of hepatitis C. This analysis presents a mechanism for generating prevalence estimates using local surveillance data accounting for biases and difficulty in accessing hard to reach populations. As the cohort of patients with hepatitis C age and require additional medical care, local public health officials will need a method to generate prevalence estimates to allocate resources. This approach can serve as a guideline for generating local estimates using surveillance data that is less resource prohibitive."

There was evidence that faecal contamination of water supplies preceded the outbreak; the epidemic curve suggested that there was a major common source of infection; the disease appeared to have affected 1-2% of the population; 90.3% (214/237) patients for whom information is available were aged 20 years or older; the disease was generally mild and affected pregnant women most severely. 49 patients were admitted to hospital and at least 4/273 died. There were prevalences of 47% (28/60) HBsAg and 69% (37/54) anti-HDV reactors among patients bled 1-43 d after the onset of illness. The main features of the outbreak conformed to published descriptions of water-borne epidemic non-A non-B hepatitis and it is postulated that the disease was most severe in patients with active HBV infection and in those with HDV superinfection, so that such patients were disproportionately represented amongst those seeking medical attention."
2780,0.005,1.0000,"The number of HIV-positive people aged ≥50 years is rising each year. We measured the prevalence of non-infectious illnesses and their risk factors and described healthcare use in this UK population. A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at an outpatient HIV specialist clinic in south east England. Patients age ≥50 years were invited to complete questionnaires measuring demographics, non-infectious illnesses, medication use, lifestyle and healthcare utilisation. The response rate was 67%. Of 299 participants, 84% reported ≥1 comorbid condition and 61% reported ≥2 (multimorbidity). Most commonly reported were high cholesterol, sexual dysfunction, hypertension and depression. In multivariate analyses, age, number of years HIV-positive and duration of antiretroviral therapy remained significant predictors of comorbidity when controlling for lifestyle factors (exercise, smoking and use of recreational drugs and alcohol). Use of non-HIV healthcare services was associated with increasing comorbidity, a longer duration of HIV and recreational drug use. The majority of HIV-patients aged ≥50 years reported multiple comorbidities and this was associated with polypharmacy and increased use of non-HIV services. Further research examining the quality, safety and patient experience of healthcare is needed to inform development of services to optimally meet the needs of older HIV-positive patients."
153,0.005,1.0000,"The method of backcalculation was applied to national surveillance data on the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in order to estimate the cumulative number of adults with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection as of January 1, 1985 and July 1, 1987. A ""plausible range"" of estimates was constructed which reflected both uncertainty about the AIDS incubation distribution and random variation from selection and fitting of flexible models of the HIV-1 infection curve. The authors estimated that, as of 1985, 411,000 to 756,000 persons were infected. The infected population included 266,000 to 492,000 homosexual men, 69,000 to 136,000 intravenous drug users, 24,000 to 49,000 homosexual intravenous drug users, and 11,000 to 26,000 persons infected through heterosexual contact. The estimated prevalence of infection among persons aged 15-55 years was 0.31% in whites, 0.78% in Hispanics, and 0.81% in blacks. An estimated 32,000 to 66,000 women were infected. Compared with white women aged 15-55 years, the prevalence of infection was 5.3-fold higher in Hispanic women and 10.2-fold higher in black women. Plausible estimates for the total number infected by July 1987 ranged from 707,000 to 1,376,000, with the most likely estimate equal to 992,000. Backcalculation provides an assessment of the magnitude of the HIV-1 epidemic that is independent of estimates based on prevalence surveys in special populations. The estimates obtained from both methods are consistent and emphasize the need for vigorous programs to prevent the spread of HIV-1, especially in minority communities."
8857,0.005,1.0000,"Comprehensive care for people seeking assistance in sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics provides access to a group of patients in need of HIV prevention interventions and represents appropriate locations for the implementation of these activities. The goal of this study was to determine the risk factors for HIV infection. A profile of patients seeking care in an STI clinic in Vitória, Brazil; including the motives for this, the risk factors and the prevalence for HIV was carried out. Patients were systematically interviewed regarding demographic information, motivation for seeking assistance, risk exposures, and clinical data. Blood samples were collected to test HIV infection in 562 people enrolled in the study. Prevalence of HIV infection was 6.8 per cent (95 per cent CI 4.7-8.9). Prevention and STI symptoms were the main reasons for seeking care. Variables found to be independently associated with HIV infection were: age (> = 30 years) [OR = 3.24 (95 per cent CI 1.40-7.52)]; seeking medical assistance [OR = 3.88 (95 per cent CI 6.22-40.95)]; and illicit drug use [OR = 14.58 (95 per cent CI 6.11-34.72)]. These results found high prevalence of HIV infection in this population and reinforce the need for ongoing STI prevention activities to further decrease HIV and other STI."
2589,0.005,1.0000,"The phenomenon of post-traumatic stress has been well documented in the literature as a lasting mental health condition associated with exposure to traumatic life events. The diagnosis and experience of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease may be such a trauma. On the other hand, the phenomenon of post-traumatic growth (PTG) has been described, whereby people show positive mental health growth in the face of such trauma. This systematic review was set out to explore post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and PTG in people with HIV to monitor prevalence, measurement and efficacy of interventions to reduce stress and/or promote growth. Standardised review techniques were used to track reports on both PTSD and PTG. A total of 206 papers were retrieved from the PTSD and HIV searches, and 13 from the PTG and HIV searches. After reviewing the papers for inclusion according to adequacy and relevance criteria and to remove duplicates, 33 PTSD papers and three PTG were available for full coding. Prevalence of PTSD in HIV ranged from 5% to 74%, which were much greater than the 7-10% in the general population. Seven studies showed a relation between trauma and PTSD, while six showed a link between PTSD diagnosis and reduced antiretroviral treatment adherence. Women were more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD. Only three intervention reports were identified that fitted our inclusion criteria. All of these reported on psychological interventions for HIV+ individuals with trauma. The interventions utilised HIV education, training in coping techniques and support groups. Only coping interventions were shown to be effective. PTG was under researched but showed a promising avenue of study. There needs to be harmonised measurement and the evidence base would need strengthening in order to build on the understanding of the impact of PTSD and PTG over the course of HIV disease. There is good evidence to associate HIV diagnosis and experiences during the course of illness as traumatic. PTSD has been shown to be prevalent and there seems to be good evidence to incorporate standardised measures to track the course of the disorder. There is extremely limited evidence that interventions may affect the course of symptom experience. The evidence and insight into PTG show promise but is currently inadequate."

The burden of these viral infections in sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria rely on estimates based on small population studies in some select populations. We present the report of a population survey in Nigeria during the period 2010-2012. A total of 5,558 adults participated in the screening exercise. The minimum age recorded was 18 years, while the maximum age was 75 years. The mean ± S.D. was 36.07 ± 8.76 years. The prevalence of hepatitis B (HBsAg) among the adults screened was determined to be 6.7% while that of hepatitis C (HCV) was 0.9%. The peak prevalence for HBsAg carriage was in the third to fourth decade in keeping with childhood acquisition while of HCV antibody was in the sixth to seventh decade. Male gender was significantly associated with HBsAg carriage while we noted a higher prevalence in those within the lower socioeconomic status. Overall our findings suggest that hepatitis B is endemic in Nigeria, much less than previously reported, while the prevalence for HCV is low although reports of pockets of high prevalence exist in select populations (hospital patients including those living with HIV)."
5087,0.005,1.0000,"Live virus vaccines can cause serious adverse reactions when administered to immunocompromised patients. Because children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be immunosuppressed, immunization of these children with live virus vaccines is a potential problem. A retrospective survey was conducted by the New York City Department of Health, with consultation from the Centers for Disease Control, to evaluate the frequency of serious adverse events following receipt of live vaccines among children with HIV infection receiving pediatric care in New York City and New Jersey. Outpatient records of 319 children being cared for by 16 participating physicians were reviewed. Of the 319 charts, 221 (69%) contained vaccination histories. Perinatal transmission of HIV infection was suspected for 208 (94%) of the 221 cases and infection via transfusion for the remaining 13 (6%). Of the 221 for whom immunization histories were available, 180 (81%) had received at least one dose of live oral polio vaccine and 70 (32%) had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. There were 120 children for whom a temporal relationship between immunization and onset of symptoms of immunodeficiency could be seen; 46/120 had received at least one dose of oral polio vaccine and 23/45 had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine after onset of symptoms. Although follow-up of this population has been limited, there were no reports of serious adverse events such as typical or atypical measles, paralytic poliomyelitis, or aseptic meningitis in the month following vaccination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
745,0.005,1.0000,"A wide variety of rheumatic diseases has been documented in the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In this conditions, physicians are refrained from using corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants agents because of the risk of favouring viral replication and the progression of the underlying viral disease. In the present review we have focused our attention on the possible role of cyclosporine A (CsA), anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) alpha agents in the treatment of HIV or HCV infected autoimmune patients. The results drown from the literature and from our personal experience confirm the safety of CsA and anti-TNF alpha agents, in terms of viral load and liver toxicity. A limited experience also suggest that both therapies can be given in combination in rheumatoid arthritis patients without increasing the risk of adverse events."
3112,0.005,1.0000,"After the infusion of HIV-1 virus into a host cell, RNA is reverse transcribed to dsDNA, which persists intracellular to the infected cell in a variety of forms. Numerous in-house assays have been developed for the quantification of the different cellular HIV-1 DNA forms; these implement conventional or real-time PCR methodology. In this review we discuss recent findings about the longitudinal monitoring of cell-associated HIV-1 DNA in naïve and pre-treated patients, as a marker for clinical progression, treatment initiation and long-term success of HAART. These findings underline the importance of monitoring HIV-1 DNA in clinical practice, in addition to HIV-RNA and CD4(+) T Cell counts, for the better assessment of HIV-treatment and disease progression. The lack of a standardized real-time PCR assay is major impediment to more wide-spread HIV-1 DNA monitoring."
8452,0.005,1.0000,"HIV/AIDS causes severe dysfunction of the immune system through CD4+ T cell depletion, leading to dysregulation of both the adaptive and innate immune arms. A primary target for viral infection is the gastrointestinal tract, which is a reservoir of CD4+ T cells. In addition to being a major immune hub, the human gastrointestinal tract harbors trillions of commensal microorganisms, the microbiota, which have recently been shown to play critical roles in health. Alterations in the composition and function of microbiota have been implicated in a variety of 'multi-factorial' disorders, including infectious, autoimmune, metabolic, and neoplastic disorders. It is widely accepted that, in addition to its direct role in altering the gastrointestinal CD4+ T cell compartment, HIV infection is characterized by gut microbiota compositional and functional changes. Herein, we review such alterations and discuss their potential local and systemic effects on the HIV-positive host, as well as potential roles of novel microbiota-targeting treatments in modulating HIV progression and associated adverse systemic manifestations."
2665,0.005,1.0000,"Jet injectors may transmit blood-borne infections, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To evaluate the safety of an anticontaminant disposable device which protects the jet injector apparatus, 22,714 healthy subjects were intradermally inoculated (38,162 inoculations) with a variety of vaccines. All the subjects were systematically followed-up clinically and epidemiologically for 6-18 months after inoculation; blood samples from 1619 subjects, before and 60-75 days after inoculation, were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV. Before vaccination 212 (13.09%) subjects were positive: 204 positive for HBV markers and eight for the HCV marker. None of the subjects were positive for the anti-HIV marker. During the clinico-epidemiological surveillance and the laboratory investigations mentioned above no clinical viral hepatitis B or C case and no seroconversion to positivity for HBV or HCV markers among the susceptible persons in the group were reported. Considering that in similar situations there is a theoretical risk of transmission as high as 1 per 388 to 1 per 3367 injections and that in our case 38,162 inoculations were performed in 22,714 subjects with the same Dermojet protected by the same type of anticontaminant disposable device, no contamination risk being reported, the conclusion can be reached that jet injectors can be safely used in the medical practice if they are protected by the sterile anticontaminant disposable device."
1692,0.005,1.0000,"A variety of antibody response patterns to the latent Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) family have been described in different groups of subjects infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The purpose of this study was to characterize the immune response to two EBNA proteins, EBNA-1 and EBNA-2, in a population of children who were born to mothers infected with HIV and who underwent EBV seroconversion. Serial serum specimens from 33 children (nine were infected with HIV, and 24 were not infected) were evaluated for the presence of antibodies to EBNA-1 and EBNA-2 by anticomplement immunofluorescence. All the EBNA serology profiles observed for children in our study who were not infected with HIV were consistent with those described for immunocompetent hosts with acute EBV infection, i.e., development of antibodies to EBNA-1, often preceded by the appearance of a humoral immune response to EBNA-2. In contrast, following EBV primary infection in HIV-infected children, antibodies to EBNA-2 arose after antibodies to EBNA-1 and tended to persist. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of EBNA-2 serology as a prognostic marker in HIV-infected children."
6067,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with adverse liver outcomes. The clinical impact of previous HBV infection on liver disease in HCV infection is unknown. We aimed at determining any association of previous HBV infection with liver outcomes using antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb) positivity as a marker of exposure. The Scottish Hepatitis C Clinical Database containing data for all patients attending HCV clinics in participating health boards was linked to the HBV diagnostic registry and mortality data from Information Services Division, Scotland. Survival analyses with competing risks were constructed for time from the first appointment to decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related mortality. Records of 8513 chronic HCV patients were included in the analyses (87 HBcAb positive and HBV surface antigen [HBsAg] positive, 1577 HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative, and 6849 HBcAb negative). Multivariate cause-specific proportional hazards models showed previous HBV infection (HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative) significantly increased the risks of decompensated cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01-1.65) and HCC (HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.09-2.49), but not liver-related death (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.80-1.30). This is the largest study to date showing an association between previous HBV infection and certain adverse liver outcomes in HCV infection. Our analyses add significantly to evidence which suggests that HBV infection adversely affects liver health despite apparent clearance. This has important implications for HBV vaccination policy and indications for prioritization of HCV therapy."
6171,0.005,1.0000,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is often atypical, and characteristically relapses after treatment. We treated 10 HIV infected patients (9 men) with parasitologically confirmed VL with liposomal amphotericin B (""AmBisome': L-AMB) at a dose of 4 mg/kg/day on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 17, 24, 31, and 38. Patients were hospitalized for the first 5 days, and were monitored during, and 1 week and 1, 3 and 6 months after, L-AMB therapy. There were no serious adverse events, and L-AMB was well tolerated. 9/10 patients completed therapy, one patient defaulted at day 24. Clinical improvement was seen in all nine patients and the bone marrow aspirate was cleared of visible/culturable parasites in 8/9 patients. During follow-up, one patient defaulted. The seven remaining patients relapsed at 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6 and 7 months. Re-treatment with a variety of antileishmanial drugs was unsatisfactory. The time from first diagnosis of VL to death in six patients was 5-40 months (mean 18.8 months). Only one patient remained alive 26 months after treatment. L-AMB is safe and provides a good initial clinical response. Intermittent dosing enables a short period of hospitalization. However, relapse is probably inevitable."
3316,0.005,1.0000,"This study investigates factors associated with the self-reported use of complementary therapies, types of therapies used, and sources of complementary therapy information among HIV-positive patients attending a public, HIV outpatient clinic in New Orleans. A convenience sample of 287 clients (220 men and 67 women) was given a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Overall, complementary therapy use was 31%. Patients who used complementary therapy were more likely to be white (O.R., 2.5), female (O.R. 3.3), a high school graduate (O.R. 2.9), and to know another complementary therapy user (O.R. 7.8). Age, sexual orientation, CD4 cell count, injection drug use, living with another HIV-infected person, having pain, and HIV support group membership were not associated. Men were more likely than women, and whites were more likely than nonwhites, to use vitamins/minerals, imagery/meditation, and dietary regimens. Nonwhites were more likely than whites, and women more likely than men, to use spiritual healing. Of those using complementary therapy, men were more likely than women, and whites more likely than nonwhites, to get information about complementary therapy from HIV organizations, friends, and homosexual-oriented media. Doctors and nurses were the most frequently cited source of complementary therapy information for women. Frequency, type of therapies used, and source of information about complementary therapy among HIV-infected persons vary by race and gender. Clinicians should be educated about complementary therapies so that they can provide information to their patients and be aware of self-treatment behavior."
3559,0.005,1.0000,"The number of new HIV diagnoses is increasing in the western world and transmission clusters have been recently identified among men having sex with men despite Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy efficacy. The objective of this study was to assess temporal trends, epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics of primary HIV infections. A retrospective analysis of 79 patients presenting primary HIV infections from 2005 to 2012 was performed in Marseille University Hospitals, southeastern France. Clinical, epidemiological and immunovirological data including phylogeny based on the polymerase gene were collected. 65 males and 14 females were enrolled. The main transmission route was homosexual contact (60.8%). Patients were mostly infected with subtype B (73.4%) and CRF02_AG (21.5%) HIV-1 strains. An increase in the annual number of HIV seroconversions among new HIV diagnoses from 5% in 2005 to 11.2% in 2012 (P = 0.06) and of the proportion of CRF02_AG HIV strains among primary HIV infections in 2011-2012 as compared to 2005-2010 (P = 0.055) was observed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four transmission clusters including three transmission clusters among men having sex with men: two large clusters of nine CRF02_AG, six B HIV strains; and one small cluster of three B HIV strains. Clusters involved more frequently men (P = 0.01) belonging to caucasian ethicity (P = 0.05), with a higher HIV RNA load at inclusion (P = 0.03). These data highlight the importance of improving epidemiological surveillance and of implementing suitable prevention strategies to control the spread of HIV transmission among men having sex with men."
132,0.005,1.0000,"Over the past 6 to 7 years an increasing incidence of acute hepatitis C virus (AHCV) has been fuelled by two different changing epidemics: (1) a new resurgence of AHCV amongst intravenous drug users (IVDU); and (2) presumed sexually transmitted AHCV amongst predominantly HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Increasing incidence amongst IVDUs is likely to be a consequence of changing injecting behaviour, possibly related to changes in perception of HIV as well as HCV risk and consequences. Increasing incidence amongst MSM is likely to be a consequence of changing sexual practices, for example number of sexual partners and type of sexual behaviour, as well as increasing availability of recreational drugs associated with sexual risk-taking, and wider availability of casual sexual partners via the internet or sex-on-premises venues. It remains unclear whether the current outbreaks in MSM, predominantly seen in HIV-positive individuals, reflect a predisposition to AHCV secondary to HIV status per se, or whether this reflects differences in behaviour amongst HIV-positive versus HIV-negative MSM, or potentially increased screening (either routine or secondary to abnormal liver function tests) in HIV-positive MSM. The majority of individuals with AHCV are asymptomatic and therefore routine screening of individuals in at-risk groups with abnormal liver function tests should be considered. Previous historical studies suggest that individuals with concomitant HIV infection are far less likely than those without to spontaneously clear HCV. It is currently recommended that such individuals acutely infected with HCV should undergo monitoring of HCV viral load levels to determine whether spontaneous clearance is likely or whether the opportunity for early treatment should be considered."
1328,0.005,1.0000,"Depression and anxiety are common among persons recently diagnosed with HIV infection. We examined whether depression or anxiety was associated with delayed initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among a prospective cohort of Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) who were newly diagnosed with HIV. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used for measuring depression and anxiety, with scores of 0-7, 8-10, and 11-21 representing normal, borderline, and likely, respectively. ART initiation information was extracted from the National ART Database. Cox regression was performed to assess associations between HADS scores and the time to ART initiation. Of 364 eligible participants enrolling in the cohort within a median of 11 days after HIV diagnosis, 62% initiated ART during the 12-month follow-up period. The baseline prevalence for likely/borderline depression was 36%, and likely/borderline anxiety was 42%. In adjusted analyses, compared with a depression score of 0, the likelihood of starting ART was 1.82 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.38-2.41], 3.11 (95% CI: 1.82-5.30), and 2.53 (95% CI: 1.48-4.32) times higher for depression scores of 3, 9, and 13, respectively. A similar pattern was observed for the anxiety score. In contrast to our hypothesis, both depression and anxiety were associated with earlier ART initiation among Chinese MSM with newly diagnosed HIV. We speculate that individuals who are more concerned about their new HIV diagnosis may be more likely to seek HIV care and follow a doctor's advice. The effects of depression or anxiety on ART initiation likely differ in varying subgroups and by symptom severity."
3028,0.005,1.0000,"Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the risk of drug-sensitive HIV transmission but may increase the transmission of drug-resistant HIV. We used a mathematical model to estimate the long-term population-level benefits of ART and determine the scenarios under which earlier ART (treatment at 1 year post-infection, on average) could decrease simultaneously both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence (new infections). We constructed an infection-age-structured mathematical model that tracked the transmission rates over the course of infection and modelled the patients' life expectancy as a function of ART initiation timing. We fitted this model to the annual AIDS incidence and death data directly, and to resistance data and demographic data indirectly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco. Using counterfactual scenarios, we assessed the impact on total and drug-resistant HIV incidence of ART initiation timing, frequency of acquired drug resistance, and second-line drug effectiveness (defined as the combination of resistance monitoring, biomedical drug efficacy and adherence). Earlier ART initiation could decrease the number of both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence when second-line drug effectiveness is sufficiently high (greater than 80%), but increase the proportion of new infections that are drug resistant. Thus, resistance may paradoxically appear to be increasing while actually decreasing."
3844,0.005,1.0000,"In the United States, black men who have sex with men (MSM) account for a disproportionate number of new cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). From 2001 to 2006, the number of HIV/AIDS cases among black MSM aged 13--24 years in 33 states increased 93%. In 2006, more new AIDS cases among black MSM were diagnosed in the South than in all other U.S. census regions combined. In November 2007, the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) reported to CDC an increase in the number of young black MSM who received diagnoses of HIV infection at a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Jackson, Mississippi. MSDH and CDC conducted a survey of 29 young black MSM in the three-county Jackson area who received diagnoses of HIV infection during January 2006--April 2008 to characterize risk behavior and HIV testing behavior. This report summarizes the results of that survey, which found that, during the 12 months before receiving their HIV infection diagnosis, 20 (69%) of the 29 participants had unprotected anal intercourse, but only three (10%) of the 29 thought they were likely or very likely to acquire HIV infection in their lifetimes. Additional investigations are needed to determine whether this sample is illustrative of other groups of black MSM at high risk for HIV infection, especially in the South. Targeted interventions that decrease HIV risk behaviors among black MSM should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to reduce HIV transmission."
7066,0.005,1.0000,"Viral sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a major health problem for women. Over many years the incidence of these infections has increased steadily to epidemic proportions. These infections not only cause short-term morbidity but also have been associated with significant long-term morbidity and mortality. This paper focuses on two of the most common viral STDs-Genital Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection of the female. The steady increase in the incidence of HIV infection and subsequent adult immunodeficiency disease (AIDS) among women requires health care providers to assume an active role in detection and treatment in order to avoid transmission, to protect the health of women with HIV/AIDS, and to reduce the risk of maternal-fetal (vertical) transmission. Because treatment with zidovudine has been shown to reduce vertical transmission, routine offering of HIV testing is currently recommended for all pregnant women. The approach to testing nonpregnant patients, i.e., the choice between selective screening or routine testing, rests with the individual clinician. Testing large numbers of patients within a practice may be facilitated by the availability of an oral antibody testing system. The sensitivity and specificity of the oral test is equivalent to blood testing. Serum and oral specimens are tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and confirmatory Western blot assays specifically designed for use with oral samples. Controversies in diagnosis as well as the most updated treatments for these infections are discussed."
693,0.005,1.0000,"In order to determine the sensitivity and specificity of two rapid human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) assays compared with enzyme immunoassay and Western blot and to assess their potential use for routine screening in an emergency department (ED), we analyzed sera from 492 consecutive ED patients using an identity-unlinked design. Sera were analyzed for HIV-1 by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot and two rapid assays: the Abbott Testpack HIV-1 (Abbott Labs, Inc, Abbott Park, IL) and the HIV-1 Genie, (Genetic Systems, Seattle, WA). Seroprevalence of HIV-1 among 492 samples was 5.1%. Both rapid assays were easy to perform and required approximately 10 minutes per test. Sensitivity and specificity of both rapid assays were 100% and 99.8%, with positive and negative predictive values of 96.2% and 100%, respectively. It was concluded that both rapid assays showed high concordance with standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. Since the ED is often the primary care setting for many patients at risk for HIV-1, the ED may be an optimal site for routine HIV-1 screening. Rapid assay screening may provide the opportunity for timely identification of HIV-1-infected patients, allowing earlier treatment and counseling. However, ethical and practical questions regarding appropriate application of rapid HIV-1 testing in EDs still needs resolution."
1174,0.005,1.0000,"The recognition and precise cleavage of the polypurine tract (PPT) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is an essential step in HIV-1 reverse transcription. The accurate cleavage, and the subsequent removal, of the PPT by the RNase H activity of HIV-1 RT defines the left end of the double-stranded viral DNA genome, the substrate for integration into the host genome. Previous analyses have shown that mutations in the 3'-end (G-tract) of the PPT cause alterations in RNase H cleavage specificity. In particular, mutations at positions 2 and 5 in the G-tract increased the frequency of retention of PPT sequences in the 2-LTR circle junction. To better understand why these mutations affected PPT cleavage in vivo, we analyzed the cleavage of PPT substrates in vitro that contained altered sequences and unusual base substitutions. Our results, herein, confirm that mutations at positions 2 and 5 of the G-tract do significantly alter the cleavage specificity at the PPT/U3 junction, and further suggest that the miscleavages observed in vivo were due to an improper generation of the PPT primer, as opposed to its improper removal. Finally, our results point to the structure of the PPT, rather than the base-specific contacts between the PPT and HIV-1 RT, as the primary determinants of RNase H cleavage specificity at the PPT/U3 junction."

3503,0.005,1.0000,"We have sought to address the problem of the host and tissue specificity of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) by using transgenic mice obtained after injection of head-to-tail dimers of the HBV genome. Viral DNA replication and protein synthesis were obtained in one of nine transgenic mice containing integrated HBV DNA. The RNAs encoding the HBV surface antigen and the core antigen were synthesized in the liver, the kidney, and the heart. In these organs, DNA replicative intermediates similar to those found during normal infection were associated with corelike structures. Large amounts of core polypeptides and capsids were detected in the nuclei in the absence of any pathological effect. These results show that the different steps of HBV multiplication can take place in nonliver nonhuman cells once the problem of entry into the host cell is overcome. In the absence of a small laboratory animal infectable by HBV, such transgenic mice should be helpful for the study of many aspects of viral multiplication."
1829,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with human immunodeficiency virus are known to have an increased risk for development of cutaneous malignant conditions. We present a 55-year-old man with a history of an isolated squamous-cell carcinoma five years prior, who presented with 27 cutaneous lesions, which had developed over the course of the preceding year. This occurred in the context of a new diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The initiation of anti-retroviral therapy and subsequent restoration of CD4 counts was associated with an increase in the number of lesions. Histopathologic examination of representative tumors showed basal-cell carcinomas, which lead to the diagnosis of eruptive basal-cell carcinomas in the setting of HIV-related immunosuppression. The incidence and epidemiology of malignant conditions that are related and non-related to AIDS are reviewed as well as discussion of the current literature regarding presentation, treatment, and prevention of non-melanoma skin cancers in patients with HIV infection."
4405,0.005,1.0000,"Acute HIV infection is rarely recognized as the signs and symptoms are normally unspecific and can persist for days or weeks. The normal HIV course is characterized by a progressive loss of CD4+ cells, which normally leads to severe immunodeficiency after a variable time interval. The mean time from initial infection to development of clinical AIDS is approximately 8-10 years, but it is variable among individuals and depends on a complex interaction between virus and host. Here we describe an extraordinary case of a man who developed Pneumocisits jiroveci pneumonia within one month after sexual exposure to HIV-1, and then presented with 3 consecutive CD4 counts bellow 200 cells/mm³ within 3 months, with no other opportunistic disease. Although antiretroviral therapy (AZT+3TC+ATZ/r) was started, with full adherence of the patient, and genotyping indicating no primary antiretroviral resistance mutations, he required more than six months to have a CD4 restoration to levels above 200 cells/mm³ and 10 months to HIV-RNA to become undetectable."
6396,0.005,1.0000,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play a crucial role in host antiviral immune response through secretion of type I interferon. Interferon alpha (IFNα), a type I IFN, is critical for mounting the initial response to viral pathogens. A consequence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV) infection is a decrease in both pDC number and function, but prolonged pDC activity has been linked with progression from HIV infection to the development of AIDS. Patients with HIV in the United States routinely use cannabinoid-based therapies to combat the side effects of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy. However, cannabinoids, including Δ-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), are well-characterized immunosuppressants. Here, we report that THC suppressed secretion of IFNα by pDC from both healthy and HIV+ donors through a mechanism involving impaired phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 7. These results suggest that THC can suppress pDC function during the early host antiviral response by dampening pDC activation."
9638,0.005,1.0000,"Quantitative assays for viral nucleic acids have been instrumental in monitoring the response of patients to various antiviral therapies. The level of viraemia is predictive of clinical outcome in that a reduced risk of progression to AIDS or death was observed with lower plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA levels. Rebound in viral levels often signals therapeutic failures, some of which are associated with the development of drug resistance. Quantitative plasma assays for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been developed. Over time, modifications to these assays have been required to meet new demands. For example, as antiviral therapies have become more effective, HIV and HCV assays of greater sensitivity are required in order to follow patients for longer periods of time and to fully assess the extent of viral suppression. For HIV-1, a large percentage of patients treated with combination therapies had viral loads that were below the detection limit of the ultrasensitive assay (50 copies/ml). To assess the residual viral burden in this patient population an assay to quantify HIV-1 proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was developed. Studies to date indicate that proviral DNA remains easily detectable despite undetectable plasma RNA and may be useful in monitoring this patient population. To increase assay throughput, a new generation of quantitative assays that will provide real-time detection and a 6 log10 detection range from a single amplification is under development."
8682,0.005,1.0000,"Cellular proteins are essential for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication and may serve as viable new targets for treating infection. Using gene trap insertional mutagenesis, a high-throughput approach based on random inactivation of cellular genes, candidate genes were found that limit virus replication when mutated. Disrupted genes (N=87) conferring resistance to lytic infection with several viruses were queried for an affect on HIV-1 replication by utilizing small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens in TZM-bl cells. Several genes regulating diverse pathways were found to be required for HIV-1 replication, including DHX8, DNAJA1, GTF2E1, GTF2E2, HAP1, KALRN, UBA3, UBE2E3, and VMP1. Candidate genes were independently tested in primary human macrophages, toxicity assays, and/or Tat-dependent β-galactosidase reporter assays. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that several host factors present in this study participate in canonical pathways and functional processes implicated in prior genome-wide studies. However, the genes presented in this study did not share identity with those found previously. Novel antiviral targets identified in this study should open new avenues for mechanistic investigation."
7273,0.005,1.0000,"The use of all potent drugs is associated with toxicities and antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are no exception. Antiretroviral therapy-associated hepatic toxicity is of increasing concern in the management of patients with HIV/AIDS. Liver toxicity has been reported in some HIV-infected patients being treated with drugs from all of these classes of ARV drugs: protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Although the majority of cases involve asymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), severe, and, in a minority of cases, life threatening, liver disease has been reported in patients treated with ARV drugs. The exact causes of elevated plasma levels of AST and ALT are complex and, in many cases, obscure. The combination of viral hepatic disease, drugs that act adversely directly on the liver and drugs that act on other systems of the body which in turn, adversely affect the liver, can result in hepatic toxicity. Such toxicity may be inappropriately attributed solely to the direct effect of a drug. Knowledge of the possible causes of liver toxicity, and ways to avoid it, should reduce the risk of developing hepatotoxicity. The physician's task is to prevent the development of liver toxicity, e.g., by choosing appropriate therapeutic regimens and by careful management of the patient. This involves frequent monitoring of the patient, both clinically and by utilizing liver function tests on a regular basis. If signs and symptoms of liver disease do develop, prompt and expert management is essential. This review discusses the influence of a number of factors on hepatic toxicity including viral hepatitis, insulin resistance and the specific ARV drugs used in the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS."
9517,0.005,1.0000,"To determine whether Korean red ginseng (KRG) has beneficial effects on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients administered highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we analyzed the CD4 T-cell count, viral load, and resistance mutations to HAART in 46 individuals. Thirteen patients harbored resistance mutations at baseline. The study population was divided into two groups: specifically, a group treated with a combination of HAART plus KRG (23 patients) and a group treated with HAART alone (23 patients). The annual increase in CD4 T-cell count in the combination group was significantly higher than that in the group treated with HAART alone (P < 0.05). Overall, 21 patients harbored resistance mutations after 3 years of therapy. Following exclusion of 13 patients displaying baseline resistance mutations, 7.1% of patients (1/14) in the combination group and 42.1% (8/19) in the HAART group were identified with resistance mutations. One patient with baseline resistance mutations in the combination group did not display resistance mutations 3 years after HAART therapy. High-level resistance mutations were significantly lower in the combination group than in the group treated with HAART alone. Five patients showed no improvement in viral copy number (26.3% [5/19]) in the combination group and 9 (45.0% [9/20]) showed no improvement in the HAART-only group. Our data support the clinical utility of KRG intake during HAART therapy."
969,0.005,1.0000,"To reduce unnecessary exposure to treatment, physicians must decide at an early stage whether continuation of treatment has a reasonable chance of success for the individual patient. The objectives of our study were to evaluate the previously described quantitative hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) measurements vs quantitative hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA measurements for prediction of nonresponse and response in interferon (IFN)-alpha treated HBeAg positive chronic HBV patients. Serum HBV DNA and HBeAg levels were assessed at baseline and weeks 8 and 12. For each test (HBV DNA level at baseline, HBV DNA decrease between baseline and weeks 8 and 12, or the combination of these two, as well as HBeAg level at baseline, HBeAg decrease between baseline and weeks 8 and 12, and the combination of these two), we calculated the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity. Monitoring with quantitative HBV DNA levels (area under ROC 0.87) was superior to monitoring with quantitative HBeAg levels (0.76, P < 0.05). Step-wise logistic regression identified HBV DNA at baseline and decrease in HBV DNA from baseline to week 12, as independent predictors of response. The overall test performance of predicting nonresponse (predictive value 100%) was best for log HBV DNA testing at week 12 compared with testing at week 8 due to a better prediction of sustained response (46%vs 38%) and lower misidentification of nonresponse (39%vs 54%). This study showed that quantitative HBV DNA testing at baseline in combination with a decrease between baseline and week 12 has a high predictive value for identifying patients who have virtually no chance of reaching a sustained response with IFN therapy."
8814,0.005,1.0000,"We investigated the circulating cytotoxic CD160+ CD8(high) subset in correlation to antiviral immunity and response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV+ subjects. The study included 45 treatment-naive patients receiving HAART for 18 months, retrospectively defined as good (n=29) and transient (n=16) responders. HIV-specific CD8 T lymphocyte levels were measured by IFNgamma production in response to p17 Gag, in the presence of immobilized anti-CD160 mAb. We report a significantly increased baseline level of CD160+ CD8(high) subset in good therapy responders. CD160+ CD8(high) subset correlates with CD4+ T cell count, immune activation, and viral load. CD160+ CD8(high) lymphocytes contain a high amount of Granzyme B and include virus-specific T lymphocytes in HIV-1+ subjects. Co-stimulation through CD160 molecules enhances IFNgamma production in response to p17 Gag. Therefore, the CD160+ CD8(high) subset may be useful for monitoring of virus-specific cellular immunity and predicting response to antiretroviral therapy in chronic HIV-1 infection."
8844,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires the presence of specific chemokine receptors in addition to CD4 to enter target cells. The chemokine receptor CCR5 is used by the macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1 that predominate during the asymptomatic stages of infection. Here we identify a small tyrosine-rich region of CCR5 proximal to the N-terminal cysteine that is critical for entry of macrophage-tropic and dual-tropic variants of HIV-1. HIV-1 infection of cells expressing CCR5 mutants with changes in this region was substantially reduced compared with the infection of cells bearing wild-type CCR5. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac239) entry was also ablated on a subset of these mutants but enhanced on others. These differences in virus entry were correlated with the relative ability of soluble, monomeric HIV-1 and SIVmac239 gp120 glycoproteins to bind the CCR5 mutants. These results identify a region of CCR5 that is necessary for the physical association of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein with CCR5 and for HIV-1 infection."
3260,0.005,1.0000,"Health professionals caring for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) show poor or negative attitudes because of fear of contagion. Therefore, it is important to know the attitudes of midwives' and nurses' towards people living with HIV/AIDS. The aim of this descriptive and cross-sectional study is to assess the attitudes of Turkish midwives and nurses working at hospitals to people living with HIV/AIDS and to identify factors that affect these attitudes. A group of 46 midwives and 192 nurses working in hospitals were included in the study. Data were collected through AIDS Attitude Scale. Age, professional experience, number of children and marital status influenced the attitudes of the participants towards people living with HIV/AIDS. We concluded that higher level of education appear to positively influence the attitudes of the participants. Education programmes including evidence-based nursing implications might be planned to improve positive attitudes and to prevent stigmatization of people living with HIV/AIDS."

There was substantial clinical benefit during IVIG treatment with marked reduction of febrile and infectious episodes, normalization of physical and psychomotor development, and absence of mortality. The immunologic monitoring revealed some discrete objective improvements. The results of this study favourably compare to previous reports. It is concluded that IVIG should be standard therapy for symptomatic childhood HIV infection."

Laboratory markers were assessed monthly. All patients experienced relief of debilitating fatigue within one month of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. It was concluded that hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an effective adjunctive treatment in the medical management of HIV/AIDS. Laboratory markers, clinical significance, nursing implications, and cost-effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy are discussed."
2147,0.005,1.0000,"Considerable speculation and a recent publication has suggested that much of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in the subset of the UK population represented by women having babies in Metropolitan London is substantially imported from Africa. Other data are supportive of this hypothesis. Ades et al. (1992) concluded that the fraction of HIV seroprevalence, identified in a large London-based study using neonatal blood from the dried blood spots on Guthrie cards, attributable to mothers born in Africa was 92.4% with 95% CI: 82-100%. This is an important observation which requires confirmation. This paper reports on an attempt to do this with closely similar methodology using the Unlinked Anonymous Survey (UAS) of HIV-1 seroprevalence in pregnant women attending antenatal centres, together with data from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) on the country of origins of mothers delivering in 1991 at the 15 London centres included in the UAS. As in Ades' analysis there appeared to be a strong association between centre prevalences and the proportions of women of African origin delivering at those centres. This was consistent with a high fraction of seroprevalence attributable to such women, but it was also clear that the assumptions required for the estimation of the attributable fractions were not fully met. Analyses modified to justify the assumptions produced attributable fraction estimates ranging from 44% to 96% with lower 95% confidence limits 20% or less.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
6336,0.005,1.0000,"Approximately 15-20% of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus will develop severe neurological disease. This may be due in part to virus-induced release of a number of putative neurotoxins. However, there is little information to predict which individuals will progress to dementia or the precise mechanisms that drive pathogenesis. In an effort to identify early markers of neurological disease progression we used an in vitro bioassay with rat cortical neurons to test for the presence of toxins in CSF from 40 HIV-infected humans with mild, minimal or no neurological disease. A subset of HIV-infected individuals was found to have significant toxic activity in CSF indicating that toxic factors may be circulating prior to the development of dementia. The toxicity was concentration dependent and due to a factor with a molecular mass of less than 30 kDa. Only a small proportion of the cell death appeared to be due to apoptosis. Neuronal toxicity was associated with a gradual accumulation of intracellular calcium in a subset of cortical neurons over a period of 1-2 h and in the absence of a significant acute response. Individuals with both high viral burden and high CSF toxicity were significantly more likely to have neurological symptoms. These initial analyses indicate that toxic factors are present in the CSF of HIV-infected patients that could serve as useful markers of neurological disease progression and provide insights into pathogenic mechanisms in vivo."
8780,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of serological markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was investigated in 75 patients with histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis Bs-antigen (HBs-Ag) was found in 30.8% and evidence of present or past infection in 61.5%. In a control group of 115 patients with liver cirrhosis of various etiologies in whom evidence of a coexistent HCC was lacking, the corresponding numbers were significantly lower (16.5% and 41.7% resp., p less than 0.05). Below the age of 65 years, markers of present or past HBV-infection were significantly more frequent than in patients above 65 years of age (p less than 0.025). All patients positive for HBs-Ag had an underlying cirrhosis; in seven cases, HCC was found in a non-cirrhotic liver. Alpha-fetoprotein measurements failed to identify patients with HCC in up to 43.6% of the HBs-Ag negative cases. It is concluded that HBV-infection does represent a cofactor in the malignant transformation of the liver, even in areas of lower incidence. Alpha-fetoprotein measurements need to be complemented by other investigations if early recognition of HCC is to lead to better survival."
5032,0.005,1.0000,"Increasing evidence has suggested that HIV infection severely damages the Vγ2Vδ2 (Vδ2) T cells that play an important role in the first-line host response to infectious disease. However, little is known about Vδ2 T cell-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in HIV disease. We found that although the CD16(+) Vδ2 T cell subset hardly participated in phosphoantigen responses dominated by the CD16(-) Vδ2 T cell subset, the potency of the ADCC function of Vδ2 T cells was correlated with the frequency of the CD16(+) subset. Thus, two distinct and complementary Vδ2 T cell subsets discriminated by CD16 were characterized to explore the respective impacts of HIV-1 infection on them. HIV-1 disease progression was not only associated with the phosphoantigen responsiveness of the CD16(-) Vδ2 subset, but also with the ability of the CD16(+) Vδ2 subset to kill antibody-coated target cells. Furthermore, both of the two Vδ2 functional subsets could be partially restored in HIV-infected patients with antiretroviral therapy. Notably, in the context of an overall HIV-mediated Vδ2 T cell depletion, despite the decline of phosphoantigen-responsive CD16(-) Vδ2 cells, CD16(+) Vδ2 cell-mediated ADCC was not compromised but exhibited a functional switch with dramatic promotion of degranulation in the early phase of HIV infection and chronic infection with slower disease progression. Our study reveals functional characterizations of the two Vδ2 T cell subsets with different activation pathways during HIV-1 infection and provides a rational direction for activating the CD16(+) Vδ2 T cells capable of mediating ADCC as a means to control HIV-1 disease."
31,0.005,1.0000,"HIV replication is suppressed in vitro by a CD8(+) cell noncytotoxic antiviral response (CNAR). This activity directly correlates with an asymptomatic clinical state. The objective of this study was to identify the phenotype of CD8(+) cell subsets having strong CNAR activity. CD8(+) cell subset frequencies and CNAR levels were measured for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected individuals and three groups of HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals: asymptomatic individuals with low-level viremia (vHIV), antiretroviral-drug-treated subjects with undetectable virus levels (TxHIV), and therapy-naïve aviremic elite controllers (EC). CD8(+) cells from the vHIV individuals exhibited the highest HIV-suppressing activity and had elevated frequencies of CD45RA(-) CD27(+) and PD-1(+) (CD279(+)) cells. Functional assessments of CD8(+) cells sorted into distinct subsets established that maximal CNAR activity was mediated by CD45RA(-) CCR7(-) CD27(+) and PD-1(+) CD8(+) cells. T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire profiles of CD8(+) cell subsets having strong CNAR activity exhibited increased perturbations in comparison to those of inactive subsets. Together, these studies suggest that CNAR is driven by HIV replication and that this antiviral activity is associated with oligoclonally expanded activated CD8(+) cells expressing PD-1 and having a transitional memory cell phenotype. The findings better describe the identity of CD8(+) cells showing CNAR and should facilitate the evaluation of this important immune response in studies of HIV pathogenesis, resistance to infection, and vaccine development."
4895,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was studied by means of CD4-expressing human-murine T-cell hybrids, containing a variable amount of human chromosomes. Fusion of the HPRT- murine cell line BW5147 with human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or normal human blood cells resulted in a panel of human-murine T-cell hybrids. For this study, we used four hybrids containing all or several human chromosomes, which all expressed the CD4 antigen, as assessed by different anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (e.g., OKT4A, Leu-3a, and MT151) and, in addition, a variable number of other human T-cell antigens. For infection, HTLV-IIIB-infected H9 cells, pretreated with mitomycin C, and cell-free concentrated supernatants from these cells were used. In cells of inoculated cultures of the CD4+ T-cell hybrids, no viral antigen could be demonstrated. Culture supernatants of inoculated hybrids, except for an initial rise due to the virus inoculum, never showed reverse transcriptase activity above background. Cocultivation of these cell cultures with H9 cells did not result in detectable virus replication. Cocultivation of CD4-expressing hybrid cells with HIV-infected cells did not result in syncytium formation. Moreover, these hybrids were resistent to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-HIV pseudotypes. These findings imply that expression of the CD4 antigen on the cell surface is not sufficient for productive infection with HIV. The infectivity block observed in these hybrids seems to occur at the level of virus penetration, presumably at the stage of membrane fusion events."
2214,0.005,1.0000,"In contrast to CD4+ T cells, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected macrophages typically resist cell death, support viral replication, and consequently, may facilitate HIV-1 transmission. To elucidate how the virus commandeers the macrophage's intracellular machinery for its benefit, we analyzed HIV-1-infected human macrophages for virus-induced gene transcription by using multiple parameters, including cDNA expression arrays. HIV-1 infection induced the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with host defense, signal transduction, apoptosis, and the cell cycle, among which the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A/p21) gene was the most prominent. p21 mRNA and protein expression followed a bimodal pattern which was initially evident during the early stages of infection, and maximum levels occurred concomitant with active HIV-1 replication. Mechanistically, viral protein R (Vpr) independently regulates p21 expression, consistent with the reduced viral replication and lack of p21 upregulation by a Vpr-negative virus. Moreover, the treatment of macrophages with p21 antisense oligonucleotides or small interfering RNAs reduced HIV-1 infection. In addition, the synthetic triterpenoid and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligand, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO), which is known to influence p21 expression, suppressed viral replication. These data implicate p21 as a pivotal macrophage facilitator of the viral life cycle. Moreover, regulators of p21, such as CDDO, may provide an interventional approach to modulate HIV-1 replication."

It has been found that both heat-stressed and chronically human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected lymphomas show an increased expression of heat-shock proteins (HSP). Moreover, murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) against 72,000 MW HSP was able to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) using peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) as effector cells. All target cells used in these experiments were efficiently lysed in the presence of anti-HSP antibody suggesting a role of membrane HSP in the elimination of stressed or infected cells."
1763,0.005,1.0000,"Microinjection of wild-type adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2) DNA and infectious human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA into the nuclei of human epithelioid SW480 cells leads to specific inhibition of HIV-1 replication. Mutational analysis of the AAV genome showed that this negative interference can be assigned to a functional AAV-2 rep gene. Moreover, the p78rep/p68rep proteins are sufficient for the anti-HIV-1 effects. The rep gene also inhibits the expression of a chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) gene driven by the U3/R portion of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) in the absence of tat expression. This suggests that the U3/R portion of HIV-1 contains elements responsible for the AAV-2 rep-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 LTR-driven CAT gene expression and, probably, also of HIV-1 replication. The results add support for the general significance of AAV-2 and specifically the rep gene as tools for down-regulating heterologous gene expression."
91,0.005,1.0000,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1) may be a key component of this process. In the present study, Tregs and conventional T cells (Tconvs) were isolated by magnetic cell sorting of peripheral blood from CHB patients (n=57), individuals with resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections (n=15), and healthy controls (n=29). SATB1 expression was studied by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy, and the correlation of SATB1 expression to the expression of liver inflammation serum markers and the HBV DNA load was assessed. CHB patients showed significantly reduced SATB1 expression in Tregs than healthy controls and individuals with resolved HBV infections. Moreover, SATB1 expression in Tregs was significantly lower than in Tconvs of patients with chronic HBV infection. Serum HBV DNA and liver inflammation markers were inversely correlated to the SATB1 mRNA level in Tregs. Antiviral treatment was accompanied by increased expression of the SATB1 gene in Tregs. Thus, Tregs from CHB patients have reduced levels of SATB1, which is resolved with antiviral therapy. Inhibition of SATB1 expression may impair the hepatic inflammatory response and contribute to HBV persistence."
5765,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and viremic individuals exhibit elevated levels of plasma cytokines. Here we show that most cytokines are not in free form but appear associated with exosomes that are distinct from virions. Purified exosomes were analyzed to determine the levels of 21 cytokines and chemokines and compared with exosome-depleted plasma. Most cytokines were markedly enriched in exosomes from HIV-positive individuals relative to negative controls and to plasma. Moreover, exposure of naive peripheral blood mononuclear cells to exosomes purified from HIV-positive patients induced CD38 expression on naive and central memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, probably contributing to inflammation and viral propagation via bystander cell activation.

1949,0.005,1.0000,"Fas/Fas Ligand (FasL) interactions play a significant role in peripheral T lymphocyte homeostasis and in certain pathological states characterized by T cell depletion. In this study, we demonstrate that antigen-presenting cells such as monocyte-derived human macrophages (MDM) but not monocyte-derived dendritic cells express basal levels of FasL. HIV infection of MDM increases FasL protein expression independent of posttranslational mechanisms, thus highlighting the virus-induced transcriptional upregulation of FasL. The in vitro relevance of these observations is confirmed in human lymphoid tissue. FasL protein expression is constitutive and restricted to tissue macrophages and not dendritic cells. Moreover, a significant increase in macrophage-associated FasL is observed in lymphoid tissue from HIV (+) individuals (P < 0.001), which is further supported by increased levels of FasL mRNA using in situ hybridization. The degree of FasL protein expression in vivo correlates with the degree of tissue apoptosis (r = 0.761, P < 0. 001), which is significantly increased in tissue from HIV-infected patients (P < 0.001). These results identify human tissue macrophages as a relevant source for FasL expression in vitro and in vivo and highlight the potential role of FasL expression in the immunopathogenesis of HIV infection."
6852,0.005,1.0000,"Viral infection may induce the cell-surface expression of PVR (CD155) that, upon recognition by its cognate activating DNAM-1 receptor present on cytotoxic lymphocytes, may promote antiviral immune responses. Here we show that expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpr protein in Jurkat T cells increases cell-surface and total PVR levels. Analysis of mutated Vpr variants indicated that Vpr uses the same protein surfaces, and hence probably the same mechanisms, to upregulate PVR and arrest the cell cycle in the G2 phase. Moreover, we found that PVR upregulation by Vpr relied on the ability of the protein to activate the ATR kinase that triggers the DNA damage response pathway and G2 arrest. Finally, we showed that Vpr contributes to PVR up-modulation in HIV-infected CD4(+) T lymphocytes and inhibits the PVR downregulating activity of the viral Nef protein. "
1315,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat affects cellular gene expression through modulation of the activity of different transcription factors. Here, the role of Tat in the cooperation between nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factors was investigated. Constitutive or transient Tat expression in Jurkat T cells enhanced cooperative NFAT/AP-1- but not AP-1-dependent transcription independent of its ability to transactivate the HIV-1 LTR. The enhancing effect of Tat took place after nuclear translocation of NFAT. Furthermore, transactivation of an NFAT/AP-1 reporter by transfection of NFAT and c-Jun was strongly enhanced by simultaneous Tat transfection. Moreover, intracellular Tat expression increased the binding of NFAT/AP-1 complexes to the interleukin 2 promoter without significantly altering NFAT- and AP-1-independent binding. HIV-1 Tat interacted with NFAT but not c-Jun. These results indicate that Tat interacts with NFAT, affecting its cooperation with AP-1, without altering independent binding of these transcription factors to DNA."

Of these 3 had a history of acute viral hepatitis, 12 were previously at risk to be infected with hepatitis viruses, 7 had neither the disease nor its risk factors, none of them had chronic active hepatitis or hepatic cirrhosis, 7 exhibited clinical signs of pseudolymphoma, 1 had serum monoclonal IgM kappa in the presence of HBV active replication markers (HBsAg IgM, HbcAb IgM). The present and previous data (on association of SS with chronic active hepatitis and hepatic cirrhosis due to HBV) suggest the involvement of the virus in SD etiology."
9239,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of hepatitis virus markers in patients with chronic liver diseases from two countries has been studied: 68 patients (38 alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis, 30 chronic HBsAg-positive hepatitis) from Hungary as well as 109 patients (55 alcoholic liver disease, 45 chronic hepatitis or cryptogenic cirrhosis and 9 hepatoma) from Romania were examined for HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HCV and anti-HDV, using the corresponding Abbott Elisa test systems. In alcoholic liver disease HBsAg occurred in 6/38 patients from Hungary and in 22/55 patients respectively, that is HBV markers occurred with significantly higher frequency in alcoholic patients from Romania (p less than 0.05). In the Hungarian group a total of 36 patients were HBsAg positive and out of them 5 had anti-HDV (13.9%), while out of 21 Romania HBsAg carriers 10 patients had anti-HDV (47.6%). Among 9 hepatoma patients 4 had HBsAg, 6 anti-HBs and 7 anti-HBc and 4 had anti-HCV and 3 had anti-HDV. One patient with hepatoma had both HBsAg and anti-HCV plus anti-HDV as well. Results suggest that the infection with hepatitis viruses in alcoholic liver diseases is more common in Romania than in Hungary, and the prevalence of delta virus infection in HBV carriers is also significantly higher in Romania than in Hungary."
909,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the frequency of the parasitic pathogens in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients in a developing world setting, 295 stool specimens were examined from 166 HIV-positive patients (49% with AIDS) at São José Hospital, Fortaleza, Brazil, from September 1990 to March 1992. Significantly more patients with diarrhea (85%) than without (66%) had AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) (P < .005). Of the potential parasitic causes of diarrhea, only Cryptosporidium parvum and microsporidia were significantly associated with diarrheal disease. Infections with C. parvum, but not microsporidia, were associated with the rainy season (P < .005). Thus, C. parvum and microsporidia are the most common intestinal parasites associated with diarrhea in an HIV-infected population in Brazil and are associated with advanced HIV disease. The association of C. parvum infections with the rainy season suggests that contaminated water may be important in its transmission; however, the source of human microsporidia requires further investigation."
4293,0.005,1.0000,"In order to evaluate the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the etiology of chronic liver diseases, paired sera of 143 patients with biopsy-documented chronic hepatitis were tested for HBsAg and anti-HBs by radioimmunoassay method. HBsAg was detected in 67.3% of patients with a preceding verified eipsode of acute hepatitis, and in 26.7% of patients with a cryptogenic form of chronic hepatitis. HBsAg was not found in any of patients with alcoholic chronic hepatitis and in only two of 18 patients with other forms of chronic liver disease. No significant difference in the incidence of anti-HBs was observed in all groups of patients. According to previous studies our results confirm the higher prevalence of HBV infection in etiology of chronic persistent and aggressive hepatitis and indicate that this prevalence may be observed especially in Middle and South Italy. The presence of HBsAg in the serum of 37.2% of our patients with cirrhosis compared with 9% of reported cases in North Italy suggest that HBV plays an important role in the etiology of cirrhosis of the liver in our area."
2277,0.005,1.0000,"The epidemiology and clinical significance of fluconazole resistance were assessed in a cohort of advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis. Fifty patients were prospectively evaluated using a novel method of detecting fluconazole resistance with chromogenic media containing fluconazole; results were confirmed with macrobroth testing. Resistant yeasts, defined as MICs > or = 8 micrograms/mL, were detected in 16 (32%) of 50 patients: 7 (14%) had resistant Candida albicans, 7 (14%) had resistant non-C. albicans yeast, and 2 (4%) had mixed resistant yeasts. MICs were > or = 32 in 11 of 16 isolates. Previous fluconazole use and severe immunosuppression were risk factors for resistance. However, 5 of 26 patients had resistant isolates with no prior fluconazole use, and all were severely immunosuppressed. Despite the high prevalence of resistance, 48 patients clinically responded to fluconazole. Fluconazole-resistant C. albicans and non-C. albicans yeast infections are common in patients with advanced immunodeficiency, but clinical efficacy of fluconazole remains high."
424,0.005,1.0000,"Genotypic testing using TRUGENE was performed for treatment-naive, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients at baseline and after initiation of protease inhibitor (PI)-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens. The genetic diversity of HIV-1 pol sequences from 92 CRF01_AE and 21 B strains was compared. Subsequently, the impact of polymorphism on resistance to therapy was studied in CRF01_AE-infected (n=29) and subtype B-infected (n=14) patients. At baseline, the differences between CRF01_AE and B strain were mainly observed in the minor mutations L10I/V, M36I and L63P/I/H (P<0.001, chi(2)). In the reverse transcriptase sequence, M41L and T215Y/S were more common in patients infected with subtype B virus (P<0.05, chi(2)). Although all patients treated with PI-based HAART had pre-existing minor mutations, a low prevalence of resistance to PIs was observed (5/43; 11.6%). Moreover, major mutations (D30N and N88D) conferring resistance to PIs were found in patients infected with subtype B strain. In conclusion, polymorphisms at the protease region may not reduce PI susceptibility during treatment. However, this study also revealed the difference in natural mutations among subtypes, which may affect the manifestation of drug resistance."
4680,0.005,1.0000,Combination antiretroviral treatment was initiated in a heterosexual couple newly diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. Multiple genotypic drug resistance testing following early rebound of viral load revealed that the same three-class-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain had been present in both patients since before initiation of treatment.
7394,0.005,1.0000,"In the USA and West Europe, nearly 80% of HIV-1-infected adults, experiencing virologic failure, harbored virus strain resistant to at least one antiretroviral drug. Limited data are available on antiretroviral drug resistance in pediatric HIV infection. The aims of this study were to analyze prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and to identify risk factors associated with resistance in this population. Prevalence of genotypic resistance was estimated retrospectively in treated children who experienced virologic failure (with HIV-1-RNA > 500 copies/ml) followed in Necker hospital between 2001 and 2003. Among 119 children with resistance testing, prevalence of resistance to any drug was 82.4%. Resistance ranged from 76.5% to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), to 48.7% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and 42.9% to protease inhibitor (PI). Resistance to at least one drug of two classes and three classes (triple resistance) was 31.9 and 26.9%, respectively. Resistance was not associated with geographic origin, HIV-1 subtype, and CDC status. In multivariate analysis, resistance to any drug remained associated independently with current low viral load and high lifetime number of past PI. Triple resistance was independently associated with the high lifetime number of past PI and with gender, particularly among children aged 11 years old or more with a prevalence seven times higher in boys than in girls. In conclusion, antiretroviral resistance is common among treated HIV-1-infected children and prevalence was similar with those observed in adult population in the same year period. However, adolescent boys seem to be at greater risk."
2424,0.005,1.0000,"The neurocognitive impact of the clade C viral strain of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has not been determined. The purpose of this study was to examine neurocognitive function in southern India among individuals with the clade C virus with advanced HIV. A battery of cognitive tasks sensitive to the effects of HIV on brain function was translated and administered in Tamil and Telegu, two widely spoken languages in southern India. A sample of 30 treatment-naïve HIV-positive individuals with a median CD4 cell count of 97, and 30 age and education matched healthy controls obtained from the same region of India, were included in the study. Results revealed significant differences on most cognitive tests, with lower performances obtained by the HIV-positive individuals. These results suggest that cognitive difficulties are present among individuals with the clade C virus in India, with as many as 56% of the patients with advanced HIV meeting the criterion for impairment in two cognitive domains. Additional study is needed to determine if clade C HIV infection is more or less prone to cause neurocognitive deficit than the clade B virus. Furthermore, the impact of antiretroviral therapy on neurocognitive dysfunction in clade C virual infection needs to be determined."
8525,0.005,1.0000,"A triterpene derived from betulinic acid (RPR103611) blocks human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and fusion of CD4+ cells with cells expressing HIV-1 envelope proteins (gp120 and gp41), suggesting an effect on virus entry. This compound did not block infection by a subtype D HIV-1 strain (NDK) or cell-cell fusion mediated by the NDK envelope proteins. The genetic basis of drug resistance was therefore addressed by testing envelope chimeras derived from NDK and a drug-sensitive HIV-1 strain (LAI, subtype B). A drug-resistant phenotype was observed for all chimeras bearing the ectodomain of NDK gp41, while the origins of gp120 and of the membrane anchor and cytoplasmic domains of gp41 had no apparent role. The envelope gene of a LAI variant, fully resistant to the antiviral effect of RPR103611, was cloned and sequenced. Its product differed from the parental sequence at two positions in gp41, with changes of arginine 22 to alanine (R22A) and isoleucine 84 to serine (I84S), the gp120 being identical. In the context of LAI gp41, the I84S substitution was sufficient for drug resistance. Therefore, in two different systems, differences in gp41 were associated with sensitivity or resistance to RPR103611. Modifications of gp41 can affect the quaternary structure of gp120 and gp41 and the accessibility of gp120 to antiviral agents such as neutralizing antibodies. However, a direct effect of RPR103611 on a gp41 target must also be envisioned, in agreement with the blocking of apparently late steps of HIV-1 entry. This compound could be a valuable tool for structure-function studies of gp41."
9081,0.005,1.0000,"High level adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is required to achieve and maintain suppression of HIV replication. Although directly observed therapy (DOT) has been suggested as an intervention to improve adherence, there is a paucity of data describing the attitudes and beliefs regarding DOT for ART among HIV-infected individuals. This study was designed to evaluate the acceptability and psychometric properties of a survey instrument for use in assessing barriers and facilitators of adherence to ART DOT in prison. From July 1, 1999 to April 1, 2000, we piloted an interviewer-administered questionnaire to assess health beliefs and attitudes regarding HIV treatment among 65 HIV-infected prison inmates receiving one or more of their antiretrovirals via directly observed therapy (DOT). The first 24 participants were administered the questionnaire to determine the feasibility of surveying prisoners in a correctional setting. There were no adherence data collected on these participants. The remaining 41 participants had their adherence measured in addition to receiving the questionnaire. Thirty-one were included in the final analysis because 10 did not complete the study. Multiple antiretroviral adherence measures (electronic device medication monitoring [eDEM] caps, medication administration records [MARs], and pill counts) were assessed among a subset of the participants (n = 31) and correlated to the instrument response items. The median internal consistency reliability coefficient for the multi-item scales was 0.79. The strongest correlation between inmates' beliefs and their adherence was between ""positive beliefs about protease inhibitors"" and the MAR adherence measure (r = 0.72; p < 0.001). This study provides preliminary support for the psychometric properties of the survey in this correctional setting."
3108,0.005,1.0000,"The study investigated the impact of xerostomia on oral health and quality of life (QoL) among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who were attending for routine HIV monitoring in Australia. This cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey and oral screening (OS) included 100 subjects who were HIV positive. The OS was conducted by a dentist blinded to the subject's survey responses. Xerostomia was determined by asking the subjects a single question. Subjects with xerostomia were found to have increased caries activity and poorer QoL, especially in the psychological dimensions of the oral health impact profile. Age and duration of HIV infection were associated with xerostomia. Early diagnosis of xerostomia and intervention with preventive dental care would potentially reduce caries and improve QoL among patients infected with HIV-1. Ongoing chronic inflammation of salivary glands despite the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapy may play a role in the etiology of xerostomia in patients infected with HIV and requires further study."
6685,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV), the causative agent of hepatitis E, is an important public health problem throughout the world. There is little information available on the autochthonous HEV infection in highland inhabitants (Tibet, average elevation >3000m) of China. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to determine the sero-prevalence of Hepatitis E and association of different risk factors in local people and pigs in Tibet, China. For this purpose, serum samples were collected from 600 local volunteers and 453 Tibetan pigs from July 2014 to August 2015. All the samples were examined for the presence of anti-HEV IgG antibodies by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). While socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics were also obtained through questionnaire. The present survey found a close relationship among the HEV of Tibetan people and pigs. The prevalence of anti-HEV IgG was detected 39.33% (236/600) and 42.38% (192/453) in local people and pigs, respectively. There was a significance association of different age groups, ethnic groups, people having contact with pigs or consuming uncooked meat, and gender of Tibetan pigs. Our findings confirmed the presence of autochthonous HEV among people and pigs in Tibet, China. Therefore, effective measures should be taken to prevent and control HEV infection in Tibet, China."
5850,0.005,1.0000,A survey was conducted in the Casablanca Regional Blood Transfusion Centre from February to May 2002. A questionnaire was given to 1750 blood donors from different groups of society to asses the knowledge of the public about hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency viruses. The responses indicated that the mechanism of HIV transmission was well known to the public: 85% gave correct answers. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses were less well understood: 60% and 54% gave correct answers respectively. Our study suggests that the public needs to be better informed about hepatitis B and C virus transmission.
8240,0.005,1.0000,"A survey of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) regarding human immunodeficiency virus infection was performed on 899 students from 3 government-administered high schools located in the Bangkok Metropolitan area. Initially, all students completed a written questionnaire (pre-test) regarding HIV/AIDS. Following this, they attended a slide lecture presentation given by a specialist physician. The same test questionnaire was then completed by the same students six weeks (post-test) later for comparison of their previous KAP. The subjects composed of male to female ratio equal to that of the median age 15-16 years old. Sixty-seven per cent of the subjects were living with their parents, 16.3 per cent with relatives and 15 per cent with friends. Ninety nine per cent of the subjects had received information on HIV/AIDS before enrollment to this study. The source of knowledge ranged from television (89.1%), teachers (81.6%), pamphlets (80.2%), newspapers (75%), radio (55%), health care workers (53.4%), friends (38.6%) and only 32.5 per cent from their parents. The subjects' knowledge about HIV/AIDS and risk factors in the post-test questionnaire was significantly increased (P < 0.001) from the pre-test status. However, their attitudes to an HIV infected person were not significantly changed in the post-test questionnaire: only the ""attending school"" question showed significantly (P < 0.05) increased numbers of agreement. Similarly, the attitudes and practices to prevent HIV infection were not significantly (P > 0.05) different between pre-test and post-test questionnaires. The result of this study is to recommend regular school-based programs of education to increase awareness of preventive strategies for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases."
6475,0.005,1.0000,"Health care workers are exposed daily to blood borne injury and infection with a high risk of hepatitis B or C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. In the 1980s, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a set of protocols and guidelines known as standard precautions (SP) to prevent accidental transmission of pathogens. The SP should be followed for each intervention or delivery of care in order to protect health care workers from risks associated with contact with blood and other biological liquids. A survey was conducted in a Western Algerian university hospital to assess nurses' adherence to SP practices. A questionnaire was administered to 450 nurses in the hospital workplace setting. A field survey was also conducted in order to take into account the means and support available to the nurses in these hospital departments, namely to determine availability of hand washing and drying facilities. A total of 133 nurses, 81 women and 52 men, participated in the survey. Personal and professional data, hand-washing frequency, glove wearing practices were collected as data. A large majority (95%) of nurses reported washing their hands after removing their gloves, and 69% of them reported washing their hands between two patients. Male nurses wear gloves more often than females (respectively 77% and 53%). Sharp instruments were correctly disposed of in a puncture-resistant container more of the time. Recapping needles has been reported by two-thirds of survey respondents. Lack of liquid soap and alcohol-based washing solution were noted as major deficiencies as well as the lack of means to properly dry hands in many health care wards. Lack of SP adherence is primarily due to the lack of awareness and knowledge as well as insufficient supply of equipment and materials for good hand hygiene maintenance. This study highlights the urgent need to implement a programme to improve SP adherence among nurses and to increase the supply of hand washing and drying materials. Greater adherence to SP practices will also reduce the risk of occupational exposure to blood borne injury and infection."
2873,0.005,1.0000,"The HAART therapy has improved life expectancy enabling long latency conditions caused by the hepatitis viruses that became the leading cause of death in HIV infected patients. In this study a group of 300 patients aged from 18 to 63 years were selected in order to assess the prevalence and consequences of HIV and the hepatitis B (HBV), C (HCV) and D (HDV) viruses coinfections. Study groups were designed for each coinfection. These groups were in turn divided in case groups formed of coinfected participants and control groups consisting of mono-infected participants. This classification was obtained by testing the participants for the presence of specific infection markers using the ELISA technique. As a result, in regard to the HIV/HBV coinfection the study group consisted of 16 coinfected participants and 114 HBV-infected participants resulting in a prevalence of the coinfection of 14%. In the case of the HIV/HDV coinfection the study group consisted of 5 coinfected participants and 45 HDV-infected participants. The prevalence of the HIV/HCV coinfection was 25% out of the 170 HCV-infected participants. The effect of the coinfections on the expression and levels of the infection markers was analyzed in constrast to those encountered in the case of the mono-infection. The observed changes in the expression of the specific hepatitis markers indicate the impact of the coinfection with HIV on the progression of the hepatitis infections. In addition, the inadequate immune response towards the hepatitis viruses in the case of the coinfected participants leads to the development of cirrhosis and end stage liver disease."
9530,0.005,1.0000,"We detected the HBV DNA in peripheral blood monocytes of 70 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 20 healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern transfer hybridization technique, the HLA-DR expression on monocytic membrane and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) content and interleukin 1 (IL 1) activity in their monocytic culture supernatant were also measured respectively by indirect immunofluorescence technique, ELISA, and thymocytic multiplication assay. HBV DNA sequences were detected in monocytes of 42(60%) of the 70 patients. The percentage of monocyte-expressing HLADR and the TNF alpha content in monocyte culture supernatant were significantly elevated in patients with HBV DNA-positive monocytes compared with those patients with HBV-DNA-negative monocytes. The percentage of monocyte-expressing HLA-DA and the level of TNF alpha produced by monocytes correlated markedly with the intensity of HBV DNA-positive signal in monocytes. These data suggested that HBV infection in monocytes might cause a series of functional changes in these cells."

Among these 973 donors, 53 (5.4%, 46 males, 7 females) were found at risk for HIV infection: intravenous drug abuse: 24 cases; heterosexuality with multiple partners: 17 cases; homosexuality: 8 cases; sexual relations with persons at risk: 4 cases. These 53 donors did not recognize their risk behaviour during the medical talk before donation. 25 out of these 53 donors were seen afterwards and one of them, homosexual man, seroconverted for anti-HIV seven months after the anti HIV negative but anti-HBc positive blood donation. We conclude that, in our experience, director surrogate viral hepatitis markers help to identify donors at risk for HIV infection, and, in one case, earlier in the course of demonstrated HIV infection than the enzyme immunoassays currently licensed."

9344,0.005,1.0000,"Nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors, including zidovudine, didanosine, and zalcitabine, remain the cornerstone of therapy against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the cause of AIDS. Although therapeutic regimens have been designed that are effective in slowing the progression of disease, therapy with these agents has not been optimized. Ultimately, therapy is destined to fail in most patients. Decisions regarding when to begin therapy and the course of action to take when failure of therapy occurs are largely in the hands of the patient's physician, and currently must be made without the support of conclusive clinical data. In addition to an understanding of the recommended dosing guidelines, proper management of AIDS therapy requires a fundamental knowledge of the disease process, the pharmacology and limitations of the agents employed against the virus, and close cooperation with the clinical laboratory. Therefore, this article reviews the pharmacology of the three drugs currently approved for treatment of HIV infection, and the current guidelines for their use. The article also reviews the clinical and laboratory management of these agents, including the use of surrogate markers and the potential for pharmacokinetic optimization of therapy."
5982,0.005,1.0000,"Background. Bacterial sepsis is a major cause of illness in human immunodeficiency virus infected patients. There is scarce evidence about sepsis among HIV patients in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the etiologic agents of bacterial sepsis and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns among HIV infected patients. Methods. A cross-sectional study was carried out from March 1 to May 2, 2013. One hundred patients infected with HIV and suspected of having sepsis were included. Sociodemographic data were collected by interview and blood sample was aseptically collected from study participants. All blood cultures were incubated aerobically at 35°C and inspected daily for 7 days. The positive blood cultures were identified following the standard procedures and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion technique. Data was entered by Epi-info version 3.5.1 and analysis was done using SPSS version 20. Results. Of the study participants, 31 (31%) confirmed bacterial sepsis. The major isolates were 13 (13%) Staphylococcus aureus, 8 (8%) coagulates negative staphylococci, and 3 (3%) viridans streptococci. Majority of the isolates, 25 (80.6%), were multidrug resistant to two or more antimicrobial agents. Conclusions. Bacterial sepsis was a major cause of admission for HIV infected patients predominated by Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci species and most of the isolates were multidrug resistant.

3545,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an increasing cause of mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive patients. Concurrent infection with HIV may accelerate the progression from cirrhosis to HCC. Viral hepatitis and alcohol abuse are the main risk factors for HCC in developed countries. Exposure to these risk factors is common among HIV-infected patients. We report the case of a 43-year-old woman affected by HCC, with unusual soft tissue metastases (left masseter muscle) and HIV/HCV coinfection. The usual route of metastatic spread from classic HCC is hematogenous, with the most common extrahepatic site being the lung. Our case, besides the unusual distant metastatic site, showed very rapid clinical progression, as has been commonly observed in HIV-infected patients with HCC. The case series of HCC in HIV-positive individuals published to date does not cumulatively exceed 70 subjects."
2175,0.005,1.0000,"In India, HSV seroprevalence and its coinfection with HIV among female patients with reproductive tract infections (RTI) are sparse. We aim to ascertain the seroprevalence of HSV and its coinfection with HIV and common sexually transmitted infections attending Obstetrics and Gynaecology outpatient department, RIMS. The study included 92 female patients with RTI. Diagnostic serology was done for HSV-1 and HSV-2 using group specific IgM indirect immunoassay using ELISA, HIV by 3 ELISA/Rapid/Simple (E/R/S) test of different biological antigen. Diagnosis of RTI was made on clinical grounds with appropriate laboratory investigations--microscopy, Gram stain smear etc. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed using Nugent's criteria, Syphilis by rapid plasma reagin (RPR) card test and Chlamydia trachomatis by IgG ELISA. Out of 92 sera tested for HSV, 18 (19.6%) were IgM HSV positive and 9 (9.8%) were HIV positive. Co-infection rate of HSV in HIV positive was 16.7%. None of the patients had clinical herpes genitalis, all were subclinical cases. 55.5% of HSV positives belongs to age group 21 to 30 years. Of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgM positives 3 (15%) had HIV, 4 (22.2%) bacterial vaginosis, 2 (11.1%) were RPR positive, 4 (22.2%) Chlamydia trachomatis, 3 (15%) were pregnant. 16 (88.8%) were unemployed, 14 (77.7%) had education level below 10 standard. Our study suggest that every case of RTI, be it an ulcerative or nonulcerative must be thoroughly evaluated by laboratory testing for primary subclinical genital HSV coinfection as this has profound implications on their judicious management and aversion of complications. Early diagnosis and treatment of HSV infection together with prophylaxis for recurrent HSV disease will prevent progression and spread of HIV disease."

4825,0.005,1.0000,"The high incidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in AIDS patients compared with many other immunosuppressive diseases suggests that HIV-1 infection is strictly related to the activation of JC virus (JCV) propagation. In this report, propagation of PML-type JCV in COS-7-derived cell lines stably expressing HIV-1 Tat (COS-tat cells) has been examined. In COS-tat cells, production of viral particles and replication of genomic DNA were markedly increased compared to COS-7 cells, as judged by HA and real-time PCR analyses. These results demonstrate that COS-tat cells provide a useful model system for studying HIV-1 Tat-mediated propagation of PML-type JCV."
4626,0.005,1.0000,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by the JC virus (JCV), a human papovavirus. PML is a relatively rare disease seen predominantly in immunocompromised individuals and is a frequent complication observed in AIDS patients. The significantly higher incidence of PML in AIDS patients than in other immunosuppressive disorders has suggested that the presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the brain may directly or indirectly contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. In the present study we have examined the expression of the JCV genome in both glial and non-glial cells in the presence of HIV-1 regulatory proteins. We find that the HIV-1-encoded trans-regulatory protein tat increases the basal activity of the JCV late promoter, JCVL, in glial cells. In a reciprocal experiment, the JCV early protein, the large tumor antigen, stimulates expression from JCVL and HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter in both glial and non-glial cells. This trans-activation occurs at the level of RNA synthesis, as measured by the rate of transcription, stability of the message, and translation. We conclude that the presence of the HIV-1-encoded tat protein may positively affect the JCV lytic cycle in glial cells by stimulating JCV gene expression. Our results suggest a mechanism for the relatively high incidence of PML in AIDS patients than in other immunosuppressive disorders. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the HIV-1 regulatory protein tat may stimulate other viral and perhaps cellular promoters, in addition to its own."

7858,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the incidence of hepatotoxicity and to investigate whether plasma concentrations of nevirapine, in addition to other risk factors, could predict hepatotoxicity during treatment with nevirapine-containing regimens, we conducted a retrospective analysis with data from 174 individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). During regular visits to the clinic, blood samples were collected for the determination of nevirapine plasma concentrations and clinical chemistry parameters including liver enzymes (LEs) and total bilirubin (TBR). Severe hepatotoxicity was defined as a grade > or =3 elevation in at least one of the tested LEs or TBR levels while on therapy. Analysis of predictive factors was focused on increases in aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) to grade > or =2. Grade > or =3 elevation developed with an incidence of 0.15 per patient year (PY); only 3.4% of the patients developed grade > or =3 values for ASAT and/or ALAT (incidence 0.03 per PY). We found that patients who use a protease inhibitor (PI) in a nevirapine-containing regimen and patients who have chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection are at a higher risk for the development of increases in ASAT and/or ALAT to grade > or =2. In contrast, the plasma concentration of nevirapine does not appear to be a predictive factor in this study population."
6122,0.005,1.0000,"JC virus (JCV) is the etiological agent of an opportunistic brain infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), in AIDS. PML is fatal in approximately 4% of HIV-infected individuals, and although the overall incidence has fallen due to highly aggressive antiretroviral therapy (HAART), this percent has remained steady. It has been shown that the Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) interacts in cells with cellular protein Puralpha. This interaction can stimulate transcription of both HIV-1 and JCV genes. HIV-1, however, infects primarily microglia and astrocytes in the brain, whereas JCV infects primarily oligodendrocytes. Although HIV-1 has been shown capable of infecting oligodendrocytes in vitro (Albright et al., 1996), no instance of viral coinfection of such cells with JCV has been reported. Tat is known to be secreted from cells in which it is made. Here we ask whether such exogenous Tat can influence JCV replication in oligodendrocytes. We find that glial cells infected with either HIV-1 or JCV are in proximity at the outer edge of PML lesions. Exogenous Tat is avidly incorporated into cultured KG-1 oligodendroglioma cells over a 72-h period and is colocalized with endogenous Puralpha both nuclear and juxtanuclear. At concentrations in the medium well below the pM range, Tat stimulates several-fold the replication in vivo of DNA initiated at the JCV origin. These results define a pathway by which a protein made by HIV-1 can directly affect the course of infection by another disease-causing virus."
5891,0.005,1.0000,"Tat is a viral protein secreted from HIV infected cells and extra cellular Tat is suspected to prevent destruction of HIV infected cells from cells of the cellular immunity. The effect of anti retroviral therapy (ART) on Tat secretion has never been investigated. In this study, we tested for antibody reactivity against Tat variants representative of the main HIV subtypes in HIV positive patients receiving ART with undetectable viral loads ( < 40 copies/mL) over the course of one year with a blood sampling every three months. For each of theses five blood sampling, an average of 50 % of patients had Anti-Tat IgG, it turned out that 86% of patients could recognize Tat at least in one blood sampling during the course of the study. Amazingly, anti-Tat IgG appeared and/or disappeared in 66 % of patients. Only 20% had anti-Tat IgG remaining persistently while 14% were consistently without anti Tat IgG in the five blood sampling. No significant correlation was found between anti-Tat IgG and CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell and B cell counts revealing the incapacity of these anti Tat IgG to neutralize extra cellular Tat. Interestingly the absence and then the appearance of anti-Tat IgG in patients suggest the presence of HIV infected cells in the blood that may constitute a significant reservoir of HIV infected cells. As a conclusion antiretroviral therapy does not block the secretion of Tat and may explain why HIV infected cells can survive in spite of an effective ART treatment."
3630,0.005,1.0000,"The AIDS epidemic has become one of the most important public health problems of this century. As the prevalence of HIV infection continues to rise, health care practitioners in all geographic regions can expect greater clinical exposure to patients infected with HIV. We conducted an anonymous survey of all practicing otolaryngologists in Ohio and California to investigate regional differences in attitudes, knowledge, and practices regarding the care of patients infected with HIV. We also examined the data with respect to year of completion of residency training to identify differences in attitudes or practices among otolaryngologists who trained in the era of AIDS (post-1982 graduates) in comparison with their predecessors (pre-1982 graduates). In comparison with Ohio otolaryngologists, California otolaryngologists reported more frequent clinical encounters with HIV-infected patients and displayed significantly better knowledge regarding the otolaryngologic aspects of HIV infection. Californians were more likely to support the right of an HIV-infected physician to maintain an unrestricted practice and would be less likely to disclose their HIV status to their patients and hospital if they were to become infected with HIV. Post-1982 graduates had more frequent encounters with HIV-infected patients than did pre-1982 graduates and demonstrated a better fund of knowledge. Although Californians were more likely than Ohioans to routinely double glove in surgery, the overall double gloving rate was low at 21%. Californians were no more likely than Ohioans to routinely use protective eyewear, water-impervious gowns, or indirect instrument-passing techniques in surgery. No differences were observed in prevalence of protective surgical precautions between pre-1982 and post-1982 graduates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

5232,0.005,1.0000,"India has approximately 5.2 million persons infected with HIV. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is being widely introduced in public clinics, many HIV-infected persons still seek care via the private sector. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2004 at six public and private sites to characterize the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of ART among patients with HIV receiving care in India. Of 1667 persons surveyed, 609 (36%) had heard of ART and 19% of these persons reported that ART could cure HIV. Twenty-four percent reported that they were currently taking ART, with 18% of these patients not actually on ART according to their provider. Major barriers to taking ART were cost (33%), lack of knowledge of ART (41%), and deferral by physician (30%). More than half of all public and private patients had not heard of CD4 (57%) or viral load testing (80%), and even fewer had received these tests (32% and 11%, respectively). Private clinic attendees were almost 4 times more likely to be on ART (35% versus 9%, p < 0.0001), more likely to be male, have a higher education, be partnered, have a higher income, and have had a CD4 or viral load (p < 0.0001). Overall, low levels of ART knowledge and access were observed among HIV infected patients, with access to ART being particularly low among patients attending public clinics. In order to make widespread dissemination of ART effective in India, further educational and programmatic efforts are likely needed to optimize access, treatment awareness, and compliance among patients with HIV."

Among 68 untreated patients, those with higher sCD14 levels had more rapid spontaneous CD4 cell decline during the first 18 months following primary infection. This association persisted after adjustment for age, the CD4 cell count, and HIV viral load at diagnosis. "

5396,0.005,1.0000,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV; formerly, feline T-lymphotropic lentivirus) is a typical lentivirus resembling human and simian immunodeficiency viruses in morphologic features, protein structure, and reverse transcriptase enzyme. It is antigenically dissimilar, however. The virus is tropic for primary and permanent feline T-lymphoblastoid cells and Crandell feline kidney cells. The virus did not grow in other permanent feline non-lymphoblastoid cells that were tested, or in lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells from man, dogs, mice, and sheep. During short-term inoculation studies in cats, the feline immunodeficiency-like syndrome found in nature was not experimentally induced, but a distinct primary phase of infection was observed. Fever and neutropenia were observed 4 to 5 weeks after inoculation; fever lasted several days, and neutropenia persisted from 1 to 9 weeks. Generalized lymphadenopathy that persisted for 2 to 9 months appeared at the same time. Antibodies to FIV appeared 2 weeks after inoculation and then plateaued. Virus was reisolated from the blood of all infected cats within 4 to 5 weeks after inoculation and persisted indefinitely in the face of humoral antibody response. Virus was recovered from blood, plasma, CSF and saliva, but not from colostrum or milk. Contact transmission was achieved slowly in one colony of naturally infected cats, but not between experimentally infected and susceptible specific-pathogen-free cats kept together for periods as long as 4 to 14 months. The infection was transmitted readily, however, by parenteral inoculation with blood, plasma, or infective cell culture fluids. In utero and lactogenic transmission were not observed in kittens born to naturally or experimentally infected queens. Lymphadenopathy observed during the initial stage of FIV infection was ascribed to lymphoid hyperplasia and follicular dysplasia. A myeloproliferative disorder was observed in 1 cat with experimentally induced infection."

Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been disproportionately affected by CA-MRSA, with increased colonization and infection documented. Several factors are likely involved in the increased CA-MRSA burden observed among HIV-infected patients, including immune factors as well as healthcare and community exposures. Proposed community exposures that have been associated with increased CA-MRSA risk include substance abuse, incarceration, geographic area of residence, and social networks. This article explores these associations and reviews the current knowledge of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of CA-MRSA in HIV-infected persons. "
1360,0.005,1.0000,"TNFα has been shown to play a role in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced insulin resistance (IR). Polymorphism of the IL28B gene that encodes IFN-lambda 3 may be associated with IR through modulation of TNFα. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between IL28B rs12979860 genotype, the level of TNFα activation and the degree of IR in patients with chronic hepatitis C. One hundred and thirty-three nondiabetic genotype 1 HCV-infected patients with biopsy proven noncirrhotic hepatitis C were investigated for IR (using HOMA index), IL28B rs12979860 genotype and fasting circulating levels of soluble receptor 1 of TNFα (sTNFR1) and adipokines: leptin, adiponectin and IL-6. The HOMA-IR was positively correlated with serum levels of leptin (r = 0.35, P < 0.0001) and sTNFR1 (r = 0.35, P < 0.0001) but not with IL-6 or adiponectin. IL28B rs12979860 CC genotype was observed in 35% patients. Genotype CC and nongenotype CC patients were similar in terms of HOMA-IR (means 1.6 ± 0.9 vs 1.7 ± 1.4) and had similar circulating levels of sTNFR1 and adipokines. Independent factors associated with IR were ferritin (OR = 1.002, P = 0.02), leptin (OR = 1.06, P = 0.02) and sTNFR1 (OR = 7.9, P = 0.04). This study suggests that in nondiabetic, noncirrhotic, HCV genotype 1-infected patients, there is no relationship between IL28B rs12979860 genotype and HOMA-IR or sTNFR1 level. HCV-related IR may be mediated through TNFα independent of IL28B genotype. "

9916,0.005,1.0000,"Humanized mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic cells have been developed as an experimental animal model for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Myeloablative irradiation is usually performed to augment the engraftment of donor hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in recipient mice; however, some mouse strains are susceptible to irradiation, making longitudinal analysis difficult. We previously attempted to construct humanized NOD/SCID/JAK3(null) (hNOJ) mice, which were not irradiated prior to human HSC transplantation. We found that, over time, many of the reconstituted CD4(+) T cells expanded with an activated effector memory phenotype. Therefore, the present study used hNOJ mice that were irradiated (hNOJ (IR+)) or not (hNOJ (IR-)) prior to human HSC transplantation to examine whether the development and cellularity of the reconstituted CD4(+) T cells were influenced by the degree of chimerism, and whether they affected HIV-1 infectivity. Indeed, hNOJ (IR+) mice showed a greater degree of chimerism than hNOJ (IR-) mice. However, the conversion of CD4(+) T cells to an activated effector memory phenotype, with a high percentage of cells showing Ki-67 expression, occurred in both hNOJ (IR+) and hNOJ (IR-) mice, probably as a result of lymphopenia-induced homeostatic expansion. Furthermore, when hNOJ (IR+) and hNOJ (IR-) mice, which were selected as naïve- and memory CD4(+) T cell subset-rich groups, respectively, were infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 in vivo, virus replication (as assessed by the plasma viral load) was delayed; however, the titer subsequently reached a 1-log higher level in memory-rich hNOJ (IR-) mice than in naïve-rich hNOJ (IR+) mice, indicating that virus infectivity in hNOJ mice was affected by the different status of the reconstituted CD4(+) T cells. Therefore, the hNOJ mouse model should be used selectively, i.e., according to the specific experimental objectives, to gain an appropriate understanding of HIV-1 infection/pathogenesis."

9061,0.005,1.0000,"Evaluation of metabolic factors and elevated γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels as independent predictors of treatment failure in a thoroughly documented cohort of HIV-/HCV-coinfected patients (HIV/HCV). Sixty-four HIV/HCV patients treated with pegylated interferon-α-2a plus ribavirin (PEGIFN + RBV) at the Medical University of Vienna within a prospective trial were included in this study. In addition, 124 patients with HIV/HCV from the AIFA-HIV and AHIVCOS cohorts were included as a validation cohort. Advanced liver fibrosis, GGT elevation, insulin resistance (IR) and low CD4+ nadir were defined as METAVIR F3/F4, GGT levels >1.5× sex-specific upper limit of normal, homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance >2 and CD4+ nadir <350 cells/μL, respectively. HCV-genotype 1/4 (OR26.3; P = 0.006), advanced liver fibrosis (OR20.2; P = 0.009), interleukin 28B rs12979860 non-C/C SNP (OR8.27; P = 0.02) and GGT elevation (OR7.97; P = 0.012) were independent predictors of treatment failure, while both IR (OR3.51; P = 0.106) and low CD4 + nadir (OR2.64; P = 0.263) were not independently associated with treatment failure. A statistically significant correlation between GGT elevation and prior alcohol abuse (r = 0.259; P = 0.039), liver steatosis (r = 0.301; P = 0.034) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (r = -0.256; P = 0.041) was observed. The importance of GGT elevation as an independent predictor of treatment failure was confirmed in a validation cohort (OR2.76; P = 0.026). While GGT elevation emerged as an independent predictor of treatment failure in both the derivation and the validation cohort, no independent associations between metabolic factors and treatment failure were observed. Thus, our findings suggest that GGT elevation is an independent predictor of treatment failure in HIV/HCV that can easily be incorporated into predictive algorithms. "

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of HBV coinfection in a large U.S. population of HCV patients. We used the National Veterans Affairs HCV Clinical Case Registry to identify patients tested for HCV during 1997-2005. Patients were categorized based on HCV exposure (any two +HCV tests or one test with a diagnostic code), HCV infection (+RNA or genotype), HBV exposure (any +HBV test, excluding +HBsAb only), and HBV infection (+HBsAg, HBV DNA, or HBeAg). The prevalence of HBV exposure among patients with HCV exposure and that of HBV infection among patients with HCV infection were determined. Multivariate logistic regression evaluated potential demographic and clinical predictors of HBV coinfection. Among 168,239 patients with HCV exposure, 58,415 patients had HBV exposure for a prevalence of 34.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34.5-35.0). Among 102,971 patients with HCV infection, 1,431 patients had HBV coinfection for a prevalence of 1.4% (95% CI 1.3-1.5).

In the present study, we have determined the effect of prior donor and recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) exposure on the incidence of those viral infections after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The study included 63 patients presented to the BMT unit; 28 of them underwent transplantation and 35 were not transplanted. All serum markers of CMV, HBV, and HCV infections were monitored using ELISA technique, as well as PCR-DNA for CMV, HBV and HCV RT-PCR techniques for HCV. The incidence of active CMV and HCV was 11/28 (39%) and 6/28 (21%) in post-BMT recipients compared to 2/35 (6%) and 2/35 (6%) in the 35 untransplanted patients (P=0.00003 and P=0.05). Whereas active HBV infection was non significantly (P=0.13) higher 3/28 (11%) in the BMT patients in comparison to 1/35 (3%) in untransplanted patients. Ten out of the 19 (53%) of the CMV-seropositive recipients developed CMV reactivation compared to 1/9 (11%) of the CMV-seronegative recipients who developed CMV seroconversion. In addition, 3/8 (38%) of the HBV-seropositive recipients developed HBV reactivation in comparison to 0/20 of the HBV-seronegative recipients. Moreover, 5/13 (39%) of the HCV-seropositive recipients developed HCV reactivation in comparison to 1/16 (6%) of the HCV-seronegative recipients who developed HCV seroconversion. In conclusion, previous exposure to CMV, HBV, and HCV infections in the recipients of BMT patients were found to influence the risk of developing those viral infections."
8979,0.005,1.0000,"In comparison with other Canadian provinces and most Western countries, the province of Manitoba maintains a different vaccination policy for hepatitis B. This policy provides selective antenatal screening for hepatitis B in women and an inoculation program for hepatitis B vaccination for fourth-grade pupils. There has been increasing concern for this policy with regard to its influence on secular trends of acute hepatitis B incidence in Manitoba. This created a need to summarise the epidemiological characteristics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Manitoba and to allocate finances and human resources for future prevention programs. The Cadham Provincial Laboratory in Winnipeg, a Canadian Public Health Laboratory, is responsible for testing all specimens for diagnosis of various common infectious diseases in Manitoba. During the period from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 2003, a total of 285,946 clinical specimens were submitted to this laboratory, which confirmed 310 cases of acute HBV and 7,556 cases of chronic HBV infection. A total of 18,168 individuals were identified as having vaccine-induced immune status. The incidence rate of acute HBV infection has significantly decreased from 6.52/100,000 person-years in 1996 to 0.86/100,000 person-years in 2003. Annual prevalence rates of chronic HBV infection in Manitoba increased slightly from 42.96 cases/100,000 population in 1992 to 71.47 cases/100,000 population in 2003. Incidence rates were generally higher in men than in women at all age groups, with values of 2.65 and 1.65 per 100,000 population, respectively (chi-square=15.768, p value <0.001). The highest incidence rate for both males and females was observed in the age group 30-34 years. The North Eastman and Winnipeg Regional Health Authorities showed significantly higher incidence rates of acute hepatitis B compared with the other nine Regional Health Authorities. Selective hepatitis B vaccination programs for children in Manitoba had achieved the greatest success in the prevention of vertical and horizontal transmission.

Adolescents and adults who attended a community health center between January 1, 1992 and May 31, 1993 and had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or another sexually transmitted disease (STD)--indications for vaccination according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--were identified through chart review. The vaccination rate and missed opportunities were determined. In addition, directors of Boston health centers were surveyed on hepatitis B vaccine at their clinics. Of 178 individuals with HIV or another STD and without serologic evidence of prior exposure to hepatitis B, two (1.1%) received the vaccine. There were 342 missed opportunities. Only two of 14 medical directors said their clinics routinely offered vaccine to individuals with STDs. The medical directors rated financial barriers as more important obstacles to hepatitis B vaccination than nonfinancial barriers. These results indicate that many high-risk adolescents and adults do not receive a preventive intervention that is federally recommended, potentially life saving, and cost effective. Inadequate public funding for vaccine may be a key barrier for this population."

There is no European consensus on the policy for the prevention of this transmission. To help define an appropriate preventive policy, we determined the prevalence of HCV infection among EPP-performing medical personnel in the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The prevalence of HCV infection was studied among 729 EPP-performing health care workers. Serum samples, stored after post-hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination testing in the years 2000-2009, were tested for HCV antibodies. Repeat reactive samples were confirmed by immunoblot assay and the detection of HCV RNA. The average age of the 729 health care workers was 39 years (range 18-66), suggesting a considerable cumulative occupational exposure to the blood. Nevertheless, only one of the 729 workers (0.14%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: <0.01% to 0.85%) was tested and confirmed to be positive for anti-HCV and positive for HCV RNA, which is comparable to the prevalence of HCV among Amsterdam citizens. Against this background, for the protection of personnel and patients, careful follow-up after needlestick injuries may be sufficient. If a zero-risk approach is desirable and costs are less relevant, the recurrent screening of EPP-performing personnel for HCV is superior to the follow-up of reported occupational exposures."

Virus was detected in 86 of 136 samples (63.2%) from 79 study subjects. HIV RNA quantity ranged from undetectable to 227,586 copies/ml. Prevalence and mean viral load were not affected by postnatal ages or maternal vitamin A supplementation. Among study subjects with multiple samples, breast milk viral load did not change at different postnatal ages. Breast milk viral load correlated positively with plasma viral load (r = 0.47; p =.005) and negatively with maternal CD4 count at entry to the study (r = -0.26; p =.02). Mothers of HIV-infected children had a higher proportion of detectable HIV RNA in their breast milk than mothers of uninfected children (p =.03) and higher mean log10 HIV RNA quantities (p =.04). In a multivariate logistic regression model, log10 HIV RNA quantity in breast milk was significantly associated with the risk of mother-child transmission (odds ratio [OR], 2.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-6.51). Thus, prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections and of mastitis and early weaning may be important elements of a public health policy that is relevant to women in developing countries with HIV infection.

Though none of the samples was HBsAg positive, 10 (33.3%) HCV-RNA positive patients were anti-HBc positive, and 12 (40.7%) were anti-HBs positive. We conclude that prevalence of hepatitis C infection is high in HD patients in our region, but not associated with active HBV infection."
5981,0.005,1.0000,"Healthcare workers are at risk of occupationally-acquired viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV). HCV is parenterally transmitted and has been found in every part of the world. This cross-sectional study was conducted to establish the awareness and attitude about HCV infections among 210 full-time and part-time nursing students of the Medical College in Bitola, Macedonia from May to June 2009. For this purpose we used a self-administered questionnaire which consisted of three parts. The first included demographic data, the second included questions about causes of infection, mode of transmission, symptoms, acute and chronic hepatitis, and prevention, and the third questions about students' attitude toward patients with suspect or confirmed HCV infection. Full-time students showed higher HCV awareness (84 %) than part-time students (69 %). 58 % of the full-time and 79 % of the part-time students said they would not avoid professional contact with suspect or HCV infected patients. Our study has shown that even though both groups of students have a sufficient knowledge about HCV to face future challenges, they need further education on the subject. Practical recommendations would help to reduce stigmatising behaviour still further."
311,0.005,1.0000,"Atazanavir is the first once-daily protease inhibitor for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection and should be used only in combination therapy, as part of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. In addition to being the most potent protease inhibitor in vitro, atazanavir has a distinct cross-resistance profile that does not confer resistance to other protease inhibitors. However, resistance to other protease inhibitors often confers clinically relevant resistance to atazanavir. Currently, atazanavir is not a preferred protease inhibitor for initial HAART regimens. In treatment-naive patients, atazanavir can be given as 400 mg/day. However, atazanavir should be pharmacologically boosted with ritonavir in treatment-experienced patients or when coadministered with either tenofovir or efavirenz. Patients who receive atazanavir experience similar rates of adverse events compared with patients receiving comparator regimens. An exception is an increased risk of asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia, which is due to competitive inhibition of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. Although hyperbilirubinemia is a common adverse drug reaction of atazanavir therapy (22-47%), fewer than 2% of patients discontinue atazanavir therapy because of this adverse effect. Common adverse effects reported with atazanavir include infection, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, peripheral neuropathy, and rash. Of significance, fewer abnormalities have been observed in plasma lipid profiles in patients treated with atazanavir compared with other protease inhibitor-containing regimens. As with other protease inhibitors, atazanavir is also a substrate and moderate inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, in particular CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Clinically significant drug interactions include (but are not limited to) antacids, proton pump inhibitors, histamine type 2 receptor antagonists, tenofovir, diltiazem, irinotecan, simvastatin, lovastatin, St. John's wort, and warfarin. We conclude that atazanavir is a distinctively characteristic protease inhibitor owing to its in vitro potency, once-daily dosing, distinct initial resistance pattern, and infrequent association with metabolic abnormalities."
9438,0.005,1.0000,"We have developed a specialized database, HBVdb (http://hbvdb.ibcp.fr), allowing the researchers to investigate the genetic variability of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and viral resistance to treatment. HBV is a major health problem worldwide with more than 350 million individuals being chronically infected. HBV is an enveloped DNA virus that replicates by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. HBV genome is optimized, being circular and encoding four overlapping reading frames. Indeed, each nucleotide of the genome takes part in the coding of at least one protein. However, HBV shows some genome variability leading to at least eight different genotypes and recombinant forms. The main drugs used to treat infected patients are nucleos(t)ides analogs (reverse transcriptase inhibitors). Unfortunately, HBV mutants resistant to these drugs may be selected and be responsible for treatment failure. HBVdb contains a collection of computer-annotated sequences based on manually annotated reference genomes. The database can be accessed through a web interface that allows static and dynamic queries and offers integrated generic sequence analysis tools and specialized analysis tools (e.g. annotation, genotyping, drug resistance profiling)."
9974,0.005,1.0000,"Dendritic cells (DCs) potently stimulate the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to CD4(+) T cells. Immature DCs (iDCs) located in submucosal tissues can capture HIV-1 and migrate to lymphoid tissues, where they become mature DCs (mDCs) for effective antigen presentation. DC maturation promotes HIV-1 transmission; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we have compared monocyte-derived iDCs and mDCs for their efficiencies and mechanisms of HIV-1 transmission. We have found that mDCs significantly facilitate HIV-1 endocytosis and efficiently concentrate HIV-1 at virological synapses, which contributes to mDC-enhanced viral transmission, at least in part. mDCs were more efficient than iDCs in transferring HIV-1 to various types of target cells independently of C-type lectins, which partially accounted for iDC-mediated HIV-1 transmission. Efficient HIV-1 trans-infection mediated by iDCs and mDCs required contact between DCs and target cells. Moreover, rapid HIV-1 degradation occurred in both iDCs and mDCs, which correlated with the lack of HIV-1 retention-mediated long-term viral transmission. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying DC-mediated HIV-1 transmission, suggesting that HIV-1 exploits mDCs to facilitate its dissemination within lymphoid tissues."
995,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 fusion inhibitor T-20 (Enfuvirtide, Fuzeon) has recently been introduced into clinical practice. T-20 in combination with HAART efficiently inhibits HIV-1 replication, however T-20 resistance has been reported and the number of confirmed resistant-associated mutations is growing. In this study we aimed to analyze HIV-1 gp41 transmembrane protein (TM) variability and primary resistance to T-20 in plasma viruses from 10 HIV-1 subtype B infected homosexuals. Nine out of ten were documented seroconverters. Nine individuals (including one long time infected therapy naïve individual) were part of four linked virus infection chains. We also examined TM polymorphism in two AIDS patients under HAART and T-20 therapy. Obtained TM amplicons were examined for minor variants by clonal analysis.Sequences polymorphism of the N-terminal regions of the fusion domain (FD) and the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain were demonstrated in examined seroconverters. Analysis of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain revealed T-20 resistance in cloned sequences from 3/10 individuals. In two individuals these mutations were present as minor viral quasispecies. Transmission of the resistant virus to the sexual partner was traced in virus infection chain.Baseline TM amplicons (population sequence) and clones from two patients under HAART did not contain T-20 resistance associated mutations. After onset of T-20 therapy only resistant viruses were identified in plasma from the patients. As shown by clonal analysis of plasma from one patient, treatment interruption results in viruses reverting to a T-20-sensitive genotype."
5762,0.005,1.0000,"The worldwide implementation of free antiretroviral therapy (ART) raised great hopes among policy makers and health organisations about the positive changes it would bring about in attitudes and behaviours towards HIV and AIDS, as well as for infected people's lives. A change in illness perception was anticipated, leading to the hypothesis of a possible change in disclosure rates, patterns and the choice of significant others to inform. In the era of free treatment availability in the United Republic of Tanzania, we examined reasons for disclosure and non-disclosure among HIV-seropositive women enrolled on ART and their choice of significant others to inform. In so doing, we contribute to the necessary yet neglected debate about the social impact of ART on the lives of infected women. The study, for which an ethnographic cross-sectional pilot approach was chosen, was conducted at the Care and Treatment Center (CTC) at Bombo Regional Hospital (BRH) in Tanga city, Tanzania. Data presented here derive from participant observation, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews conducted with 59 HIV-seropositive women on ART. Interestingly, and despite treatment availability, the choice of significant others to inform, as well as reasons for disclosure and non-disclosure, mirror findings from previous studies conducted before the introduction of free ART. The main reason for non-disclosure was fear of discrimination. The hope for social, economic or health support was the main motivation for disclosure, followed by the need for a 'clinic companion' in order to receive ART, as requested by hospital staff. Nevertheless, healthcare staff were not unanimous in thinking that disclosure is always beneficial, thus the recommended extent of disclosure varied. ART and concomitant factors were raised as an entirely new and significant reason for disclosure by interviewees. Finally, findings confirm that despite ART, disclosure remains a highly stressful event for women. "

Similar percentages of patients in the 3 study arms achieved reduced levels (</=20 copies/mL) of HIV RNA. In the area under the curve minus baseline analyses, a better response was found in the Rtv/Sqv arm than in the Rtv arm. No difference was found when comparing Rtv/Sqv with Idr and Rtv with Idr. Patients in the 3 arms had comparable increases in CD4 cell counts. At 72 weeks of follow-up, there was no statistical difference between arms for the primary study end point (</=20 HIV RNA copies/mL); however, some of the additional analyses indicated an advantage for the Rtv/Sqv arm, especially when compared with the Rtv arm."

2344,0.005,1.0000,"The indinavir dosage regimen currently used for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children is not based on pharmacokinetic data obtained in the target patient population. The purpose of our study was to characterize indinavir pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in HIV-infected children. Eleven children (age range, 9.0 to 13.6 years; weight range, 21.7 to 56.0 kg) receiving indinavir (500 mg/m(2) every 8 h) in combination with lamivudine and stavudine were studied. The correlation of indinavir pharmacokinetic parameters and demographic parameters was evaluated. Also, the pharmacodynamic relationship between parameters of indinavir exposure and parameters of renal toxicity and immunologic recovery was studied. The area under the indinavir concentration-time curve (AUC) and patient body surface area (BSA) showed a significant negative correlation (r = 0.73; P = 0.012). Patients with smaller BSA had excessive indinavir AUC compared to adults. On the other hand, the median minimum drug concentration in plasma (C(min)) was lower than that reported for adults. The maximum indinavir concentration in serum was higher in patients with renal toxicity (5 out of 11 children), but the difference was not statistically significant (15.3 +/- 8.2 versus 9.8 +/- 4.4 mg/liter; P = 0.19). There was a trend toward higher immunologic efficacy in patients with greater indinavir exposure: the time-averaged AUC of the percentage of CD4(+) lymphocytes over the baseline value for patients with indinavir C(min) > 95% inhibitory concentration (IC(95)) was higher than in patients with C(min) < IC(95) (P = 0. 068). Our study suggests that a dose reduction may be appropriate for children with small BSA and that a 6-h dosage regimen may be indicated for a substantial percentage of patients. Due to the low number of patients enrolled in this study, our results should be confirmed by a larger study."

This prospective cohort study aimed to assess the determinants of and the temporal trends in HIV-1 vertical transmission in the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte, Brazil from January 1998 to December 2005. The rate of HIV-1 vertical transmission decreased from 20% in 1998 to 3% in 2005. This decline was associated with increased use of more complex ART regimens during pregnancy. Multivariate analysis restricted to clinical variables demonstrated that non ART, neonatal respiratory distress/sepsis and breastfeeding were independently associated with HIV-1 vertical transmission. When laboratory parameters were included in the model, high maternal viral load and non maternal ART were associated with HIV-1 vertical transmission. The results from this study confirm the impact of ART in the reduction of HIV-1 vertical transmission and indicate the need for improvement in the care and monitoring of mother and infant pairs affected by HIV-1."

The present study was designed to investigate the differential expression patterns of ISG20 in liver biopsy samples from treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B and non-HBV infected controls and to determine the relation between the differential expression and IFN-α treatment outcome (responders vs. non-responders). HBV infection status was determined by measuring levels of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) by chemoluminescence immunoassay and of HBV DNA by real-time quantitative (q)PCR. ISG20 protein and mRNA expressions were assessed by immunohistochemistry and qPCR, respectively. Chronic hepatitis B responders showed significantly higher levels of ISG20 protein and mRNA expressions than either the chronic hepatitis B non-responders or the controls. Moreover, increased expression of ISG20 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm was correlated with positive response to IFN-α treatment. Thus, active transcription and translation of ISG20 may represent a marker to identify chronic hepatitis B patients likely to respond to IFN-α therapy. Prognostic clinical strategies based upon this marker may include genomic screening methods and immunohistochemical staining of liver biopsies."
7958,0.005,1.0000,"We have studied the proliferation and CD40 antigen expression of lymphocytes, and the cytotoxicity to monocytes, of antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the SP II promoter of HBV mRNA (sequence I) and the X gene (sequence II) in patients with chronic hepatitis B. The oligo sequence I stimulated proliferation of both T and, to a lesser extent, B cells. The percentage of cells expressing CD40 in T and B cell co-cultures increased from 4.2% to 13.8% after oligo stimulation in patients, while it increased form 4.7% to 48.6% in healthy controls. The sense sequence (sequence III) of the X gene also enhanced the expression of CD40 antigen in patients with hepatitis B. The proportion of CD40 cells (26%) in a resting B-cell preparation from hepatitis B patients decreased to zero after a 5-day culture with sequence I, but IgG levels in the culture supernatant increased. The cytotoxic properties of monocytes were not influenced by the oligos. These findings indicate that antisense oligos against hepatitis B virus (HBV) have mitogenic effects on the proliferation of human lymphocytes in a non-specific manner and may activate T cells to express CD40 antigen."

From 97 hemodialysis patients tested, 51 were found to have at least one hepatitis B virus specific marker. 18 were HBsAg carriers, 12 of these carriers have to be regarded as infectious as judged from the presence of HBeAg and/or HBV-specific DNA polymerase activity in the serum. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were found in the sera of approximately 20% of the hemodialysis patients with a high prevalence in cases which lacked HBV markers. We conclude from our study that HBsAg-positive hemodialysis patients should be dialyzed in a separate unit and preferably served by personnel which is anti-HBs-positive. The question whether patients in which anti-HBc represents the only HBV marker should be separated is still open and needs further work.

The sensitivity of the method was 0.1 pg HBV-DNA/100 microliters. HBV-DNA could be detected in 62% of cases of HBs-Ag-positive sera with HBe-Ag, in 8.9% with anti-HBe and in 11% of e-marker free sera. In acute hepatitis HBV-DNA was present in 44%, in chronic hepatitis in 71% of HBe-Ag-positive sera. In HBs-Ag-negative sera containing only anti-HBc, HBV-DNA, depending on the anti-HBc-titre, was present in 13-24% of cases. HBV-DNA could not be detected in patients with HBV infections (anti-HBc and anti-HBs positive) in the past or in HBV-marker-negative hepatitis. Follow-up investigations on acute and chronic HBV-infections showed that the disappearance of HBV-DNA generally preceded the disappearance of HBe-antigen by about 2-3 weeks. In chronic hepatitis the time interval can amount to several months or years.

Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is defined in a patient with the presence of HBV-DNA but a lack of HBsAg in the serum and hepatocytes. OBI can be considered as a high potential risk factor for inducing post transfusion hepatitis (PTH), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cirrhosis, and reactivation of the HBV. Recently, several investigations from various regions of the world have reported PTH as well as HCC and cirrhosis among blood recipients with diseases such as thalassemia and other disorders requiring regular hemodialysis. This form of hepatitis also causes complications for individuals that are co-infected with other viruses such as HCV and HIV. Because of its extreme disease potential, OBI can be considered a high risk for PTH, HCC, and cirrhosis. Therefore, an understanding of the prevalence of OBI among blood donors is a critical strategy in most transfusion services.

Worldwide, the majority of cases of chronic HBV infection are in people who contracted the virus during birth. There is a lack of awareness in the United States that immigrants from HBV-endemic countries may be at high risk for chronic HBV. Thus, at-risk individuals may not be screened for HBV. The most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend HBV screening for all people born in Asia, all U.S.-born persons who were unvaccinated as infants and whose parents were born in regions of high HBV endemicity (> or = 8%), and individuals with parenteral risk factors. Screening for HBV starts with HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), HBsAb (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen), and total anti-HBc (total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen) testing.

The study was designed as a retrospective cohort study with a sample consisting of 145 males who underwent tooth extraction. The patients' medical and dental records were reviewed to identify HIV serostatus, to document the frequency and type of postoperative complications, and to collect data on potential confounding variables. Forty-four patients were identified as HIV+. The postoperative complication rate in HIV+ patients was 20.9% and for HIV-negative (HIV-) patients 2.9% (relative risk = 7.0, 95% confidence interval = 2.0-25.0, P = 0.001). Furthermore, as the manifestations of the symptoms of HIV infection became more severe, the postextraction complication rate also increased (P = 0.008). The results of this study suggest that HIV+ patients have an increased risk of postextraction complications and as the level of HIV disease increases, the risk of complications also increases. While the findings of this study are consistent with studies based on case series, prospective cohort studies are required to confirm the findings."

Biomedical and demographic characteristics of the subjects at the start of the study period were evaluated as predictors of CD4(+) T cell loss in univariate and multivariate models. Two-thirds of the 99 subjects meeting the selection criteria were female and 87% were black or Hispanic similar to the REACH cohort as a whole. Higher absolute CD8(+) CD38(+) T cell counts at the start of the assessment period were associated with a greater rate of loss of CD4(+) T cells. HIV-1 RNA viral load was among other potential predictors of HIV-1 disease progression that had no association with the rate of CD4(+) T cell loss in this cohort.

At baseline, HIV prevalence was 25.3%, and HCV prevalence was 54.5%. Seropositive persons with prevalent HIV infection were used to estimate baseline HIV incidence by means of the Calypte HIV-1 BED Incidence EIA (Calypte Biomedical Corporation, Portland, Oregon). Longitudinal HIV and HCV incidence were measured among 865 HIV-negative IDUs and 519 HCV antibody-negative IDUs followed semiannually for 2 years. Participants received pre- and posttest risk reduction counseling at each visit. Estimated HIV incidence at baseline was 2.95 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21, 4.69) by BED assay; observed HIV incidence over 1,262 person-years was 0.48 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.17, 1.03). HCV incidence over 645 person-years was 1.71 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.85, 3.03). Self-reported risk behaviors declined significantly over time, from 100% of participants reporting drug injection at baseline to 11% at 24 months. In this cohort with high HIV and HCV prevalence at enrollment, the authors observed low incidence and declining self-reported risk behavior over time. While no formal intervention was administered, these findings highlight the potential impact of voluntary counseling and testing in a high-risk cohort."

Between May 2013 and July 2014, a cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence and potential risk factors associated with the acquisition of HEV infection by children in China. A total of 1,500 healthy children (range 1-18; 942 and 558 from urban and rural areas, respectively) were recruited to examine for the presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics from the examined children were obtained. The overall seroprevalence of HEV in the examined children was 14.93%. Of these, 174 (11.60%) were positive for only anti-HEV IgG antibodies, 50 (3.33%) were IgM positive and IgG negative, and 44 (2.93%) were positive for both anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies. Age, type of residence area, contact with pigs, and source of drinking water were found to be associated with HEV infection. These findings demonstrated the high prevalence of HEV and the considerable potential for the transmission of HEV infection in children in China."
6529,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this investigation was to determine the impact on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tropism of uncontrolled virus exposure during 2 years of intermittent highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The Istituto Superiore di Sanità-Pulsed Antiretroviral Therapy (ISS-PART) randomized study compared the outcome of 2 years of structured treatment interruptions (STIs) versus standard continuous treatment in first-line HAART responder subjects. The STI schedule consisted of five STIs of 1, 1, 2, 2, and 3 months, respectively, separated by four periods of 3-month therapy. In the present study, coreceptor tropism was assessed in 12 patients of the STI arm at different time points over a period of 2 years. Tropism was determined on DNA and RNA by V3 loop region sequencing. The Geno2pheno algorithm (false-positive rate, FPR: 20%) was used for data interpretation. At baseline, 9/12 subjects (75.0%) had CCR5-tropic viruses in their HIV. Three had a CXCR4-tropic virus. Ten patients maintained the same coreceptor in DNA after 2 years, whereas in two patients, a shift occurred (one R5-X4, one X4-R5). In a patient with an R5 virus at baseline, a transient change to X4 tropism was seen in the rebounding virus during STI. Changes in tropism were not associated with the amplitude and duration of virus exposure during STIs, residual viremia at baseline, or the development of resistance mutations in the RT region. Our preliminary results suggest that viral replication, observed after short periods of treatment interruption, is not enough to drive the evolution of HIV tropism."
2818,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatic steatosis is an emerging cause of morbidity in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced HIV patients. The influence of steatosis on fibrosis is poorly understood. We report two cases of rapid evolution of disseminated macrovacuolar steatofibrosis to cirrhosis. Both patients had no history of alcohol abuse, nor intravenous drug use and were tested negative for HCV (PCR RNA) and had no HBS antigen. Patient 1 had a past history of hypertrygliceridemia, but controlled with dietetic measures for 4 years prior to biopsy. The first hepatic biopsy showed a disseminated macrovacuolar steatosis (>80%). The patient had then cytolysis and an uncontrolled HIV viral load. The second biopsy was performed two years later, and HIV was controlled by a new line of ART. It showed a regression of the steatosis (10%) and a progression of the fibrosis with signs of cirrhosis. Patient 2 had a long history of HIV infection. He also had an uncontrolled dyslipidemia. The first biopsy was realised during a period of uncontrolled HIV infection and elevated liver enzymes. The biopsy showed a major macrovacuolar steatosis (>80%). The second biopsy was realised 6 years after and showed the same steatosis and signs of cirrhosis. The HIV infection was then under control. Observations reported here show a rapid evolution of liver steatosis to cirrhosis in HIV positive / HCV negative patients, despite the control of HIV infection. The implication of HAART remains unclear. In the era of HAART, liver steatosis can rapidly evoluate to cirrhosis without any risk factor except ART."
5453,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and tuberculosis (TB) are overlapping epidemics that cause an immense burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa. This region is home to the majority of the world's co-infected patents, who have higher TB case fatality and recurrence rates than patients with TB alone. A World Health Organization interim policy has been developed to reduce the joint burden of TB-HIV disease, an important component of which is provision of HIV care to co-infected patients. This review focuses on HIV testing of TB patients and, for those who are HIV-positive, the administration of adjunctive cotrimoxazole preventive treatment (CPT) and antiretroviral treatment (ART). HIV testing has moved from a voluntary, client-initiated intervention to one that is provider-initiated and a routine part of the diagnostic work-up. The efficacy and safety of CPT in HIV-infected patients is now well established, and this is an essential part of the package of HIV care. ART scale-up in Africa can substantially improve outcomes in co-infected patients. However, the clinical and programmatic challenges of combining ART with anti-tuberculosis treatment need to be resolved to realise the full potential of this benefit. These include the optimal time to start ART, how best to combine rifampicin-containing regimens with first-line and second-line ART regimens, management of immune reconstitution disease, the role of isoniazid preventive treatment with ART after TB treatment completion, and where and how to provide combined treatment to best suit the patient. Clinical and operational studies in the next few years should help to resolve some of these issues."
5987,0.005,1.0000,"Polymorphisms in CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), the major coreceptor of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), have a major influence on HIV-1 transmission and disease progression. The effects of these polymorphisms may, in part, account for the differential pathogenesis of HIV-1 (immunosuppression) and SIV (natural resistance) in humans and non-human primates, respectively. Thus, understanding the genetic basis underlying species-specific responses to HIV-1 and SIV could reveal new anti-HIV-1 therapeutic strategies for humans. To this end, we compared CCR5 structure/evolution and regulation among humans, apes, Old World Monkeys, and New World Monkeys. The evolution of the CCR5 cis-regulatory region versus the open reading frame as well as among different domains of the open reading frame differed from one another. CCR5 cis-regulatory region sequence variation in humans was substantially higher than anticipated. Based on this variation, CCR5 haplotypes could be organized into seven evolutionarily distinct human haplogroups (HH) that we designated HHA, -B, -C, -D, -E, -F, and -G. HHA haplotypes were defined as ancestral to all other haplotypes by comparison to the CCR5 haplotypes of non-human primates. Different human and non-human primate CCR5 haplotypes were associated with differential transcriptional regulation, and various polymorphisms resulted in modified DNA-nuclear protein interactions, including altered binding of members of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors. We identified novel CCR5 untranslated mRNA sequences that were conserved in human and non-human primates. In some primates, mutations at exon-intron boundaries caused loss of expression of selected CCR5 mRNA isoforms or production of novel mRNA isoforms. Collectively, these findings suggest that the response to HIV-1 and SIV infection in primates may have been driven, in part, by evolution of the elements controlling CCR5 transcription and translation."
744,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-infected children are at high risk of acquiring drug-resistant viruses, which is of particular concern in settings where antiretroviral drug options are limited. We aimed to assess resistance patterns and predict viral drug susceptibility among children with first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure in Uganda. A cross-sectional analysis of children switching ART regimens due to first-line failure was performed at three clinical sites in Uganda. HIV-RNA determination and genotypic resistance testing on all specimens with HIV-RNA >1,000 copies/ml were performed. Major drug resistance mutations were scored using the 2011 International Antiviral Society-USA list. The Stanford algorithm was used to predict drug susceptibility. At the time of switch, 44 genotypic resistance tests were available for 50 children. All children harbored virus with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance [95% confidence interval (CI) 92-100%] and NRTI resistance was present in 98% (95% CI 88-100%). Forty-six percent (95% CI 30-61%) of children harbored ≥2 thymidine analog mutations. M184V was identified as the only NRTI mutation in 27% (95% CI 15-43%). HIV susceptibility to NRTIs, with the exception of tenofovir, was reduced in ≥60% of children. Ugandan children experiencing first-line ART failure in our study harbored high rates of dual-class and accumulated HIV drug resistance. Methods to prevent treatment failure, including adequate pediatric formulations and alternative second-line treatment options, are urgently needed."
9964,0.005,1.0000,"We developed a recombinant virus technique to determine the coreceptor usage of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from plasma samples, the source expected to represent the most actively replicating virus population in infected subjects. This method is not subject to selective bias associated with virus isolation in culture, a step required for conventional tropism determination procedures. The addition of a simple subcloning step allowed semiquantitative evaluation of virus populations with a different coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) usage specificity present in each plasma sample. This procedure detected mixtures of CCR5- and CXCR4-exclusive virus populations as well as dualtropic viral variants, in variable proportions. Sequence analysis of dualtropic clones indicated that changes in the V3 loop are necessary for the use of CXCR4 as a coreceptor, but the overall context of the V1-V3 region is important to preserve the capacity to use CCR5. This convenient technique can greatly assist the study of virus evolution and compartmentalization in infected individuals."

1629,0.005,1.0000,"We sought to determine the prevalence and associated characteristics of hepatitis A, B, C and D viruses and HIV infections in a prison in Durango, Mexico. Sera from 181 inmates were analysed for HAV antibody, hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HCV antibody, HDV antibody, HIV antibody and HCV genotypes. Prevalence of HAV antibody, HBcAb, HBsAg, HCV antibody, HDV antibody and HIV antibody were 99.4, 4.4, 0.0, 10.0, 0.0 and 0.6% respectively. HCV genotype 1a predominated in HCV-infected inmates (62.5%), followed by HCV genotype 1b (25%) and HCV genotype 3 (12.5%). An association between HBV infection and age > 30 years was found. HCV infection was associated with being born in Durango City, history of hepatitis, ear piercing, tattooing, drug abuse history, intravenous drug use and lack of condom use. We concluded that the prevalence of HAV, HBV, HDV and HIV infections in inmates in Durango, Mexico were comparable to those of the Mexican general population and blood donors, but lower than those reported in other prisons around the world. However, HCV infection in inmates was higher than that reported in Mexican blood donors but lower than those reported in other prisons of the world. These results have implications for the optimal planning of preventive and therapeutic measures."
6734,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Gag precursor protein is cleaved by viral protease (PR) within GagPol precursor protein to produce the mature matrix (MA), capsid, nucleocapsid, and p6 domains. This processing is termed maturation and required for HIV infectivity. In order to understand the intracellular sites and mechanisms of HIV maturation, HIV molecular clones in which Gag and GagPol were tagged with FLAG and hemagglutinin epitope sequences at the C-termini, respectively were made. When coexpressed, both Gag and GagPol were incorporated into virus particles. Temporal analysis by confocal microscopy showed that Gag and GagPol were relocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Mature cleaved MA was observed only at sites on the plasma membrane where both Gag and GagPol had accumulated, indicating that Gag processing occurs during Gag/GagPol assembly at the plasma membrane, but not during membrane trafficking. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging suggested that these were the primary sites of GagPol dimerization. In contrast, with overexpression of GagPol alone an absence of particle release was observed, and this was associated with diffuse distribution of mature cleaved MA throughout the cytoplasm. Alteration of the Gag-to-GagPol ratio similarly impaired virus particle release with aberrant distributions of mature MA in the cytoplasm. However, when PR was inactive, it seemed that the Gag-to-GagPol ratio was not critical for virus particle release but virus particles encasing unusually large numbers of GagPol molecules were produced, these particles displaying aberrant virion morphology. Taken together, it was concluded that the Gag-to-GagPol ratio has significant impacts on either intracellular distributions of mature cleaved MA or the morphology of virus particles produced."
295,0.005,1.0000,"The emergence of resistance to lamivudine has been one of the major stumbling blocks to successful treatment and control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. The major mechanism of resistance has been attributed to the alteration in the YMDD motif of the HBV polymerase due to an amino acid change of rtM204 to V/I and an accompanying rtL180M conversion. A novel mutation pattern in a patient having clinical breakthrough under lamivudine therapy was discovered. The mutant had a rtL180C/M204I genotype and was detected after 2 years of therapy with lamivudine. To characterize this novel variant, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a vector construct containing the HBV genome. Transient transfection studies in human hepatoma cells with HBV carrying the new mutant demonstrated that the rtL180C/M204I mutant was resistant to lamivudine up to 10 microM. The resistance profile was comparable to that of the previously reported rtL180 M/M204I-containing virus. These observations were further confirmed by generation of stable cultures transfected with the mutant virus."
2970,0.005,1.0000,"We have constructed a series of retroviral vectors in which the expression of antisense RNA targeted at the full length coding sequence of HIV-1 tat or rev was driven by three different promoters and in the context of double-copy or single-copy vectors. Jurkat cells transduced by these vectors were shown to express the expected tat or rev antisense RNA without alteration in cell proliferation or surface CD4 expression. After challenge with HIV, four patterns of protection were identified, with the degree of protection being determined primarily by the design of the expression system. In those patterns showing long-term complete protection, we could detect no HIV p24 in the culture supernatants or in the cells, and no HIV RNA or HIV proviral DNA (by PCR), during a 23-week follow-up. Experiments designed to rescue any live virus still formed in the culture after 20 weeks' challenge demonstrated that, with some constructs, infectious virus could no longer be isolated, while with other constructs, only a low level of infectious virus was still being formed and providing a continuing virus challenge, although all other markers of infection remained undetectable. Our results demonstrated that antisense RNA expression driven by tRNA promoter in the context of a double-copy vector conferred better long-term protection against HIV infection compared to that driven by HIV LTR or MLV LTR promoters, and that the optimized vectors may be useful in developing a gene therapy against HIV-1 infection and AIDS."
5529,0.005,1.0000,"Previously, it was demonstrated that antibody production against hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (anti-HBs) achieved in hemodialysis patients is suboptimal. Decreased health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and depression is common among hemodialysis patients. This study evaluated whether HRQOL and depressive behavior are associated with antibody response against HBV surface antigen in hemodialysis patients. Depressive symptoms and HRQOL were assessed by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36), respectively. Patients were separated into non-seroconversion (anti-HBs antibody titers <10 IU/L) and seroconversion (anti-HBs antibody titers > or =10 IU/L) groups. Among 188 patients, 37 (19.7%) were diagnosed as nonresponsive to vaccination (anti-HBs antibody titers <10 IU/L). Anti-HBs response is positively associated with Physical Component Summary Score of SF-36 (odds ratio: 1.44; P: 0.009) and albumin (odds ratio: 10.615, P: 0.007), and negatively with BDI score (odds ratio: 0.903, P: 0.007). We concluded that HRQOL and depression is closely related with antibody response following HBV vaccine in hemodialysis patients."
9849,0.005,1.0000,"The case of a young female patient with chronic active hepatitis B, vasculitic purpura, edema, and circulating immune complexes due to mixed cryoglobulinemia is described. Serum transaminases were elevated. Serological assays showed hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) antibodies but no antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) or antibody to hepatitis delta virus (anti-HDV) antibodies. Using hepatitis B virus-polymerase chain reaction (HBV-PCR) and direct sequencing a precore/core (preC/C) mutant unable to synthesize HBeAg was detected in serum. HBV antigens were demonstrated in the circulating immune complexes. Following 1 month of treatment with interferon-alpha 2b3 miu three times weekly, alanine aminotransferases returned to normal levels while cryoglobulins and immune complexes disappeared from serum. In addition, 2 months after the onset of treatment serum HBV-DNA was no longer detectable by PCR. Prior to treatment the analysis of cellular immune reactions of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a major proliferative response to HBcAg, preS1Ag and HBxAg and a minor response to HBeAg and HBsAg. One month after conclusion of treatment a decline in T-cell reactivity against all HBV antigens was observed. During clinical response to the therapy, however, a strong proliferative response of T cells to HBcAg and HBeAg was demonstrated. In conclusion, immune complex disease may complicate chronic hepatitis B in patients expressing HBe-minus HBV mutants. Treatment with interferon-alpha was found to be effective in mixed cryoglobulinemia even in the presence of HBe-minus HBV mutants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7182,0.005,1.0000,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma is recognized as a complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Little is known regarding the influence of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the biology of EBV in this population. To characterize the EBV- and HIV-specific serological responses together with EBV DNA levels in a cohort of HIV-infected adults treated with HAART, a study was conducted to compare EBV and HIV serologies and EBV DNA copy number (DNAemia) over a 12-month period after the commencement of HAART. All patients were seropositive for EBV at baseline. Approximately 50% of patients had detectable EBV DNA at baseline, and 27/30 had detectable EBV DNA at some point over the follow-up period of 1 year. Changes in EBV DNA copy number over time for any individual were unpredictable. Significant increases in the levels of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) and Epstein-Barr early antigen (EA) antibodies were demonstrated in the 17 patients who had a good response to HAART. Of 29 patients with paired samples tested, four-fold or greater increases in titers were detected for EA in 12/29 (41%), for EBNA in 7/29 (24%), for VCA-IgG in 4/29 (14%); four-fold decreases in titers were detected in 2/29 (7%) for EA and 12/29 (41%) for EBNA. A significant decline in the titer of anti-HIV antibodies was also demonstrated. It was concluded that patients with advanced HIV infection who respond to HAART have an increase in their EBV specific antibodies and a decrease in their HIV-specific antibodies. For the cohort overall, there was a transient increase in EBV DNA levels that had declined by 12 months."
2154,0.005,1.0000,"The pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) associated dementia in adults involves neuronal loss from discrete areas of the neocortex and subcortical regions, but the mechanism for neuronal death is poorly understood. Gene-directed cell death resulting in apoptosis is thought to be a normal feature of neuronal development, but little is known about neuronal apoptosis in disease states. We investigated whether HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system is spatially associated with apoptosis of neurons. Using an in situ technique to identify newly cleaved 3'-OH ends of DNA as a marker for apoptosis, we demonstrate the presence of apoptotic neurons in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia of children that had HIV-1 encephalitis with progressive encephalopathy. Furthermore, an association was observed between the localization of apoptotic neurons and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates containing HIV-1 infected macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Apoptotic neurons and p24-positive macrophages were observed infrequently in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia in children with HIV-1 infection without encephalitis or clinical encephalopathy. In nine control (HIV-1 negative) brains, ranging from the first post-natal month of life to 16.5 years of age, infrequent neuronal apoptosis was observed in three cases. These findings suggest that neuronal apoptosis is unlikely to be associated with post-natal development except in early post-natal germinal matrix, and that it may instead represent the end result of specific pathological processes, such as HIV-1 encephalitis."
9602,0.005,1.0000,"Recombinant glycoprotein 120 (rgp120) of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) activates the human complement system in the absence of anti-gp120 antibodies. HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120 can dissociate from the viral envelope either spontaneously or after binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 molecule. As a consequence, gp120 can circulate in the patient's serum and attach to the surface of uninfected CD4+ T cells. Complement activation by cell-bound HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120 with subsequent opsonization may represent a mechanism for the elimination of uninfected CD4+ cells by the reticuloendothelial system, thereby enhancing the progression of HIV disease. In the current study, the complement proteins C4,C3,C5,C9, and properdin were found to bind to a synthetic peptide covering positions 233-251 of the gp120BRU sequence on incubation with normal human serum. Complement activation by the peptide was comparable with that induced by aggregated IgG, complete rgp120, and the previously described complement-activating gp41-peptide 609-623. Activation occurred via the classical pathway and was abrogated in the presence of EDTA, Mg2+/EGTA, or C4-deficient human serum. Peptides partly overlapping the sequence 233-251 activated complement to a lesser extent. The complement-activating capacity of the gp120 sequence 233-251 was not restricted to the HIV-1BRU isolate, because a peptide from the corresponding sequence of the HIV-1MN strain was also capable of activating complement. An additional strong complement-activating site was identified in the gp120 sequence 321-360 of the HIV-1MN strain. These data indicate that distinct sites in gp120 are able to activate human serum complement via the classical pathway in the absence of anti-gp120 and independent of glycosylation."

Sera from 38% (16 of 43) of the patients with AIDS and 35% (43 of 123) of HIV-positive individuals reacted with EBNA2B, versus 25% (21 of 83) of the high-risk patients and 7.5% (5 of 65) of the normal persons. Screening these sera against cell lines that express EBNA2B, EBNA2A, or neither antigen revealed that only a proportion of these sera contained EBNA2B-specific antibodies. Many sera reacted with both antigens. Of the EBNA2B-specific sera, 14% (6 of 43) were from patients with AIDS, 16% (20 of 123) from HIV-positive individuals, 5% (4 of 83) from high-risk individuals, and 4.5% (3 of 65) from normal persons. The presence of antibodies to the EBNA2B in HIV-infected individuals indicates that they may be infected with type B strains of EBV."
2159,0.005,1.0000,"Our previous study demonstrated the anti-apoptosis function of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vpu gene product in normal CD4+ T lymphocytes. In this study, using sequences obtained from the HIV sequence database, we compared vpu sequences from 184 preparations of various subtypes of HIV-1 from diverse geographical regions. Our analysis revealed that CRF01_AE isolates had premature stop codon mutations at the vpu gene at a much higher rate (36%) than other subtypes (0-9%). The premature stop codon mutations in vpu existed mostly at two amino acid residues: the methionine initiation codon and the boundary between the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains. The mutations at the latter site were more often detected in CRF01_AE. The higher mutation rates at vpu in CRF01_AE were confirmed by sequence comparison of polymerase chain reaction products newly obtained directly from the DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but not from the RNA from the plasma, in CRF01_AE- and subtype B-infected individuals. This finding may indicate the possibility that the more abundant population of HIV-1 CRF01_AE is able to induce apoptosis in CD4+ T lymphocytes than the populations of other subtypes."
2518,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment predictors are important tools for the management of therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C virus (HBV, HCV) infection. In chronic hepatitis B, several pretreatment parameters have been identified for prediction of virologic response to interferon alfa-based antiviral therapies or treatment with polymerase inhibitors. In interferon alfa and pegylated interferon alfa-treated patients, low baseline HBV DNA concentrations, HBV genotype A (B), and high baseline ALT levels are significantly associated with treatment response. In patients treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues, low baseline HBV DNA but not viral genotype is positively associated with virologic response. During treatment the best predictor of response is HBV DNA kinetics. Early viral suppression is associated with favourable virologic response and reduced risk for subsequent resistance mutations. For the current standard treatment with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C, infection with HCV genotypes 2 and 3, baseline viral load below 400,000-800,000 IU/ml, Asian and Caucasian ethnicity, younger age, low GGT levels, absence of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, and absence of steatosis in the liver have been identified as independent pretreatment predictors of a sustained virologic response. After initiation of treatment, initial viral decline with undetectable HCV-RNA at week 4 of therapy (RVR) is the best predictor of sustained virologic response independent of HCV genotype."

However, information on the long-term effect of such therapy on serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) level and elimination of HBsAg is not available. ETV therapy was started in 553 nucleos(t)ide-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis B infection (HBeAg positive: 45%) in our hospital. Serum HBsAg levels were measured serially by the Architect assay. The median baseline HBsAg was 2180 IU/mL (0.12-243 000 IU/mL), and median follow-up period was 3.0 years, with 529, 475, 355, 247 and 163 patients followed-up for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively. At year 5, the mean log HBsAg decline from baseline was -0.48 log IU/mL, and the cumulative HBsAg clearance rate was 3.5%. Multivariate analysis identified HBV DNA level at baseline (<3.0 log copies IU/mL, odd ratio = 10.2; 95% confidence interval = 1.87-55.5, P = 0.007) and HBsAg level (<500 IU/mL, odd ratio = 29.4; 95% confidence interval = 2.80-333, P = 0.005) as independent predictors of HBsAg seroclearance.

8633,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) has been suggested as an additional marker of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HBcrAg combines the antigenic reactivity resulting from denatured hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), HBV core antigen and an artificial core-related protein (p22cr). In Asian patients, high levels of HBcrAg have been suggested to be an independent risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma, while low levels could guide safe cessation of treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues. We here studied HBcrAg levels in different phases of HBV infection in a large European cohort predominantly infected with genotypes A and D: HBeAg-positive immune tolerance (n = 30), HBeAg-positive immune clearance (IC) (n = 60), HBeAg-negative hepatitis (ENH) (n = 50), HBeAg-negative inactive/quiescent carrier phase (c) (n = 109) and acute hepatitis B (n = 8). Median HBcrAg levels were high in the immune tolerance and immune clearance phases (8.41 and 8.11 log U/mL, respectively), lower in ENH subjects (4.82 log U/mL) but only 2.00 log U/mL in ENQ subjects. Correlation between HBcrAg and HBV DNA varied among the different phases of HBV infection, while HBcrAg moderately correlated with hepatitis B surface antigen in all phases. ENQ patients had HBcrAg levels <3 log U/mL in 79%, in contrast to only 12% in the ENH group. HBcrAg levels vary significantly during the different phases of HBV infection. HBcrAg may serve as valuable marker for virus replication and reflect the transcriptional activity of intrahepatic cccDNA. In HBeAg-negative patients, HBcrAg may help to distinguish between inactive carriers (ENQ) and those with active disease (ENH)."
8385,0.005,1.0000,"Over 1 million people in the United States are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which may progress to AIDS. The use of antiviral therapy has successfully controlled the rate of viral growth in patients. Antiviral agents improve the quality of life and reduce the potential for spreading HIV; HIV is currently considered a chronic disease provided patients are compliant with their antiviral medications. Tenofovir is a nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor that prevents viral replication and is approved for treatment of HIV and chronic hepatitis B infection. Tenofovir is an antiretroviral drug used alone and in combination with other nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor agents to lower viral load in HIV patients. Tenofovir is administered as a prodrug to increase bioavailability. The prodrug forms of tenofovir are tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, approved in 2001, and tenofovir alafenamide, approved in 2016. Tenofovir is extensively used in controlling HIV, as it is administered once daily, allowing for good compliance. This minireview discusses the impact of food, age, and drug transporters on tenofovir absorption and clearance. The changes in dosing that are needed in the presence of renal impairment, which is a common occurrence with HIV chronic disease progression, will also be discussed. The potential special conditions occurring with fixed-combination doses containing tenofovir will also be reviewed, including the use of cobicistat, a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor. The short review also addresses some newer preparations using niosomes to improve tenofovir absorption and delivery to the target cells."
1231,0.005,1.0000,"We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, dose-escalation trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of single, oral doses of amprenavir (141W94; formerly VX-478), a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 protease, administered as hard gelatin capsules in 12 HIV-infected subjects. The doses of amprenavir evaluated were 150, 300, 600, 900, and 1,200 mg. Amprenavir was rapidly absorbed, with the time to maximum concentration occurring within 1 to 2 h after dosing. On the basis of power model analysis, the increase in the maximum concentration of amprenavir in plasma (Cmax) was less than dose proportional, and the increase in the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-infinity) was greater than dose proportional; mean slopes (with 90% confidence intervals) were 1.25 (1.16 to 1.35) and 0.78 (0.78 to 0.86) for AUC0-infinity and Cmax, respectively. Amprenavir was eliminated slowly, with a terminal-phase half-life of 8 h. A second study was conducted to determine the bioavailability of the hard gelatin capsule relative to that of a subsequently developed soft gelatin capsule. The capsules were bioequivalent in terms of AUC0-infinity but not in terms of Cmax; geometric-least-squares means ratios (with 90% confidence intervals) were 1.03 (0.92 to 1.14) and 1.25 (1.03 to 1. 53) for AUC0-infinity and Cmax, respectively. Administration of soft gelatin capsules of amprenavir with a high-fat breakfast resulted in a 14% decrease in the mean AUC0-infinity (from 9.58 to 8.26 microg. h/ml), which is not likely to be clinically significant. The most common adverse events related to amprenavir were headache, nausea, and hypesthesia. Amprenavir appears to be safe and well tolerated over the dose range of 150 to 1200 mg. On the basis of the present single-dose studies, amprenavir is an HIV protease inhibitor with favorable absorption and clearance pharmacokinetics that are only minimally affected by administration with food."
834,0.005,1.0000,"To study how GB virus C (GBV-C) coinfection affects the response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), 146 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients were tested for GBV-C RNA and antibodies against GBV-C E2 protein, and responses to HAART were evaluated. GBV-C-infected patients exhibited a complete virological response to HAART more often than patients without [correction] GBV-C and had a greater increase in median CD4 cell count and a marginally greater median HIV RNA level decrease. This association was found to be independent of baseline CD4 cell count and plasma HIV RNA, which indicates that an association exists between GBV-C infection and response to HAART."
4229,0.005,1.0000,"Reactivation of hepatitis B is characterized by a sudden increase in hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication in a patient with prior evidence of resolved or inactive HBV infection. Although HBV reactivation can occur spontaneously, it usually occurs after chemotherapy, immunosuppression (organ transplantation) or an alteration in immune function (therapy for autoimmune disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection). The clinical presentation cases can vary, ranging from a subclinical, asymptomatic course to severe acute hepatitis and even death. Although reactivation of HBV is mainly found in HBsAg-positive patients, it can be observed in serologically recovered anti-hepatitis B core antibody (HBc)-positive, HBsAg-negative patients. Serum HBV DNA typically increases during immune suppression, followed by a disease flare and HBV DNA clearance following immune restoration after immune suppression is stopped. In organ transplant recipients, without immune reconstitution, high HBV DNA levels can lead to fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis related to the direct cytopathic effect of HBV. Several randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown that reactivation can be prevented by lamivudine prophylaxis. Screening for HBsAg and anti-HBc should be performed before beginning immunosuppressive treatment and routine prophylaxis is recommended in HBsAg-positive patients. The optimal duration of prophylaxis remains to be determined. In anti-HBc-positive patients with or without anti-hepatitis B surface antigen, alanine transaminase and HBV DNA levels should be closely monitored and antiviral therapy should be started when HBV reactivation is confirmed. The use of new more potent nucleos(t)ides analogues with lower resistance rates would seem to be logical; however, experience with these drugs in the prophylaxis and treatment of severe HBV reactivation is limited."
3203,0.005,1.0000,"In patients coinfected and treated for both HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV), administration of ribavirin (RBV) may result in altered intracellular drug levels of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors through inhibition of inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase. Drug interactions between tenofovir and RBV were studied in vitro in order to provide insights into the safety of co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) and RBV in HCV/HIV-1-coinfected patients. In accordance with previous in vitro studies, strongly increased anti-HIV activity was observed when RBV was combined with didanosine (ddl). In contrast, low-level anti-HIV antagonism was observed when RBV was combined with either tenofovir or abacavir. Significantly stronger anti-HIV antagonism was observed when RBV was combined with either zidovudine, stavudine, emtricitabine or lamivudine. Thus, although tenofovir and ddl are both adenosine analogues, their in vitro interactions with RBV are markedly different. These results suggest a low potential for increased toxicity upon co-administration of tenofovir DF with RBV in patients."
8063,0.005,1.0000,"A quantitative rapid assay to detect resistant clinical human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains remains an important medical goal. A system incorporating a quantitative RNA.RNA hybridization assay that measures the amount of intracellular HIV-1-specific RNA has been employed to detect the level of inhibition by nucleoside analogues in sensitive and resistant HIV-1 strains. The RNA.RNA hybridization assay readily distinguished previously published zidovudine (ZDV; 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine)-resistant isolates from ZDV-sensitive isolates of HIV-1. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ZDV for HTLV-IIIB and sensitive clinical HIV-1 isolates is between 0.01 and 0.04 microM. HIV-1 strains from three patients on long-term ZDV therapy displayed a greater than 20-fold increase in the ZDV IC50 compared to sensitive strains. The drug sensitivity system was confirmed by showing that mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase gene from a ZDV-resistant isolate resulted in four amino acid changes (Leu-125----Trp, Ile-142----Val, Thr-215----Tyr, and Pro-294----Thr) including one change (Thr-215----Tyr) that has been previously reported to be associated with resistance. One clinical HIV strain with high-level ZDV resistance displayed a 5-fold increase in 2',3'-dideoxyinosine IC50 compared to that of HTLV-IIIB. A drug sensitivity assay employing RNA.RNA hybridization may be useful for extensive screening of HIV isolates from patients enrolled in clinical trials and permit the correlation of in vitro resistance with clinical outcome."
7162,0.005,1.0000,"Entecavir (ETV) is a potent nucleoside analogue against hepatitis B virus (HBV), and the emergence of drug resistance is rare in nucleoside-naive patients because development of ETV resistance (ETVr) requires at least three amino acid substitutions in HBV reverse transcriptase. We observed a case of genotypic ETVr with viral and biochemical breakthrough during ETV treatment of nucleoside-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A 57-years-old HBeAg-positive man received ETV 0.5 mg/day for 145 weeks. HBV DNA was 7.7 log10 copies/ml at baseline, decreased to below 2 at week 48, declined to a nadir of 0 (negative) at week 72, and rebounded to 2.2 log10 copies/ ml at week 90 and remained this level until 109 weeks and increased to 6.8 log10 copies/ml at week 145. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level increased to 440 IU/L at week 145. The ETVr-related substitution (rtS202P) and lamivudine resistance-related substitutions (rtL180M+rtM204V) were detected by DNA sequencing analysis at week 145. The patient discontinued ETV therapy at week 145, and then received 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Afterwards, HBV DNA level dropped to below 2.6 log10 copies/ml and ALT level was normalized after 19 weeks of TDF dosing. The three substitutions associated with ETV and lamivudine resistance developed after complete viral suppression in a nucleoside-naive CHB patient during ETV treatment. In spite of the extremely rare chance of viral mutation during ETV treatment, nucleoside-naive patients should be carefully monitored for resistance even if complete suppression is present."
7591,0.005,1.0000,"It has been reported that breast-feeding is responsible for approximately 40% of the HIV transmissions from HIV-positive mothers to children. Human breast milk, however, is known to contain numerous biologically active components which protect breast-fed infants against bacteria, viruses, and toxins. The purpose of this study was to purify and characterize breast milk mucin and to determine its anti-HIV-1 activity in an HIV inhibition assay. Sepharose CL-4B column chromatography and caesium chloride isopycnic density gradient purification were used to isolate and purify the mucin. Following Western blotting and amino acid analysis, an HIV-1 inhibition assay was carried out to determine the anti-HIV-1 activity of crude breast milk and purified milk mucin (MUC1) by incubating them with HIV-1 prior to infection of the human T lymphoblastoid cell line (CEM SS cells). SDS-PAGE analysis of the mucin, together with its amino acid composition and Western blotting, suggested that this purified mucin from human breast milk was MUC1. The HIV inhibition assay revealed that while the purified milk mucin (MUC1) inhibited the HIV-1 activity by approximately 97%, there was no inhibition of the HIV-1 activity by crude breast milk. Although the reason for this is not clear, it is likely that because the MUC1 in crude milk is enclosed by fat globules, there may not be any physical contact between the mucin and the virus in the crude breast milk. Thus, there is a need to free the mucin from the fat globules for it to be effective against the virus."

2588,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resistance development was evaluated in vitro by using combinations of the drugs tenofovir and emtricitabine or abacavir and lamivudine, as well as by using the compounds individually. Emtricitabine- and lamivudine-resistant HIV-1 isolates with the M184I or M184V mutation in reverse transcriptase were readily selected in the cultures with emtricitabine alone, lamivudine alone, and the two drug combinations and conferred high-level resistance to emtricitabine and lamivudine. Tenofovir-resistant HIV-1 isolates with the K65R mutation occurred in both the culture with tenofovir alone and the culture with the combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir. The S68N and S68K mutations were also observed in the tenofovir cultures, with no detectable impact on resistance, suggesting a possible compensatory role in viral fitness. At low concentrations of emtricitabine and tenofovir, the M184I mutation appeared first, followed by the K65R mutation, in a subset of viruses. At intermediate concentrations of emtricitabine and tenofovir, viruses harboring the K65R mutation or a novel K65N and K70R double mutation grew before they gave rise to mutants with K65R and M184V/I double mutations at higher emtricitabine concentrations. Abacavir resistance was characterized by the accumulation of the M184V, Y115F, and K65R mutations in the abacavir culture, while the M184V and L74V mutations were selected in combination with lamivudine. In the presence of the abacavir resistance mutations, viral growth was strong even in the presence of high concentrations of abacavir. In contrast, viral growth was markedly impaired in the cultures with high tenofovir concentrations, even in the presence of K65R. In conclusion, these studies show that HIV-1 mutants with a K65R and M184V genotype are generated under maximum selection pressure from the combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine."
501,0.005,1.0000,"Renal dysfunction is an increasingly recognized non-AIDS-defining comorbidity among HIV-infected persons. The role of HIV-related factors in renal dysfunction remains unclear. We performed a cross-sectional study at two military clinics with open access to care to determine the impact of HIV factors, including antiretroviral therapy, on renal function. Renal dysfunction was defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). We evaluated 717 HIV patients with a median age of 41 years; 92% were male, 49% Caucasian, and 38% African American; median CD4 count was 515 cells/mm(3) and 73% were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Twenty-two patients (3%) had renal dysfunction. Factors associated with renal dysfunction in the multivariate logistic analyses included older age (odds ratio [OR] 2.0 per 10 year increase, p = 0.006), lower CD4 nadir (OR 0.6 per 100 cell change, p = 0.02), and duration of tenofovir use (OR 1.5 per year use, p = 0.01). Among persons initiating tenofovir (n = 241), 50% experienced a reduction in GFR (median -10.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 95% CI, -8.9 to -13.3) within 2 years. Among tenofovir users, factors associated with a reduction in GFR included female gender (p < 0.001), African American ethnicity (p = 0.003), and lower CD4 nadir (p = 0.002). In summary, renal dysfunction was relatively uncommon among our HIV-infected patients, perhaps due to their young age, lack of comorbidities, or as a result of our definition that did not include proteinuria. Renal dysfunction was associated with duration of tenofovir use. Factors associated with renal loss among tenofovir users included female gender, African American ethnicity, and CD4 nadir <200 cells/mm(3). Consideration for more frequent monitoring of kidney function among these select HIV patients may be warranted."
1162,0.005,1.0000,"A new inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been isolated and purified to homogeneity from the seeds and fruits of the Momordica charantia. This compound, MAP 30 (Momordica Anti-HIV Protein), is a basic protein of about 30 kDa. It exhibits dose-dependent inhibition of cell-free HIV-1 infection and replication as measured by: (i) quantitative focal syncytium formation on CEM-ss monolayers; (ii) viral core protein p24 expression; and (iii) viral-associated reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in HIV-1 infected H9 cells. The doses required for 50% inhibition (ID50) in these assays were 0.83, 0.22 and 0.33 nM, respectively. No cytotoxic or cytostatic effects were found under the assay conditions. These data suggest that MAP 30 may be a useful therapeutic agent in the treatment of HIV-1 infections. The sequence of the N-terminal 44 amino acids of MAP 30 has been determined."
3080,0.005,1.0000,"Although HIV-1 can be successfully eradicated from the circulating blood of HIV-1-infected individuals using anti-retroviral therapy (ART), HIV-1 virions emerge immediately after the interruption of ART. This study was aimed to investigate the origin of the emerged HIV-1. After obtaining informed consent, blood samples from nine HIV-1-infected individuals and endoscopic ileum samples from five of the individuals were obtained. Purified peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs)and ileum cells were analyzed by flow-cytometry, and the V3 loop sequences of the HIV-1 envelope protein were determined. By comparing the V3 loop sequences of the samples, we confirmed that the provirus hidden in the CD4(+) PBMCs was not the source of the HIV-1 that emerged after the interruption of ART. Although free virus and HIV-1-p24 antigen (p24)-positive cells were not seen in the blood of patients receiving ART, proviral DNA and p24 could be detected in the ileum from the same patient. Among the HIV-1-infected CD4(+) cells in the ileum samples, Vα24(+) natural killer T (NKT) cells were the major p24-positive cells. These results suggest that the innate NKTcells in the mucosal compartment are the most likely candidates for the origin of the HIV-1 that emerged after ART was interrupted."
6132,0.005,1.0000,"As lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for pregnant women is implemented, it is important to understand the attitudes and norms affecting women's postpartum ART adherence. This is a qualitative cross-sectional study of HIV-positive postpartum women (n = 112) enrolled in a 2-year observational prospective cohort in Rwanda. Informed by the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), we conducted in-depth interviews with women whose children were 0-6, 7-12, 13-18, or 21-24 months of age to describe factors contributing to adherence and changes over time. Positive ART attitudes reported by women included mothers' health promotion, prevention of infant HIV infection, higher CD4 count, and improved physical appearance. Negative attitudes were few, but included side effects and the lifelong nature of treatment. Learning from people living with HIV (PLHIV) was identified as a norm facilitating adherence; ART adherence was inhibited by fear of disclosure or stigmatization in communities and clinics. Poor adherence behaviors were common immediately after HIV diagnosis, not necessarily during prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). Women with older children, most of whom stopped breastfeeding by 13-18 months, reported more barriers and missed doses than women with younger children. The TRA was useful in identifying the collective influence of attitudes, norms, and intentions on behavior. Findings suggest that HIV-positive women are vulnerable to poor adherence following HIV diagnosis and around the time of breastfeeding cessation. Lifelong treatment adherence can be supported through PLHIV exemplifying long-term ART use, fewer and less stigmatizing clinic visits, and counseling messages highlighting the benefits of drugs on appearance and illness prevention and incorporating biological feedback."
8226,0.005,1.0000,"Although HIV positive patients' adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is relatively high in African nations, as compared with industrialized nations, few studies have explored why. In the research presented here we aimed to understand the dynamics of good adherence to ART among patients receiving free ART and HIV-related services from a clinic in Arusha, Tanzania. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 6 health care providers and 36 patients at a health care center in Arusha in 2006. Interviews were conducted in Swahili using interview guides informed by social cognitive theory. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed in Kiswahili, translated into English and coded for themes and patterns with ATLAS.ti. Of the 36 patients interviewed (mean time on ART 9.8 months; range 1-23 months), 32 reported perfect adherence in the previous month. Self-reported adherence was high despite economic hardship, depression, low rates of HIV disclosure and high perceived HIV-associated stigma. Five factors emerged to explain excellent adherence in the face of such barriers. First, all respondents experienced substantial improvements in their health after starting ART; this supported their confidence in the medication and motivated them to adhere. Second, their perceived need to be able to meet their family responsibilities motivated respondents to stay healthy. Third, respondents developed specific strategies to remember to take pills, particularly routinizing pill-taking by linking it with daily activities or events. Fourth, material and emotional support received from others facilitated adherence. Finally, respondents trusted the advice and instructions of their health care providers, who regularly emphasized adherence. The facilitating factors identified were consistent with the constructs of social cognitive theory and highlighted the importance of interventions that address multiple levels of influence on adherence."
5214,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the attitudes of cancer patients towards the medical interview and to determine their psychosocial satisfaction subsequent to the dialogue. The answers given by patients with curable cancer were compared to those given by cancer patients whose treatment intent was palliative and to the replies of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a nonmalignant but also incurable state. The subject population comprised a total of 139 patients. Patients had to complete a questionnaire with a total of 34 items. The answers to the questions were rated on a 5-point scale with response options ranging from 1 to 5 or consisting of true-false statements. Cancer patients, palliative and curative, and HIV-positive patients considered their physicians to be honest (x = 4.34, x = 4.58, and x = 4.30, respectively; p = 0.104), and they emphasized that he/she took enough time answering their questions (x = 4.00, x = 4.30 and x = 4391, respectively; p = 0.12). Cancer patients treated with potentially curable disease were more frequently afraid of being informed about additional diagnostic examinations and about the disclosure of results as compared to cancer patients on palliative care (p < 0.05 for both questions). Patients with HIV-infection considered themselves less informed about the treatment they received as compared to curative cancer patients (x = 3.73 and x = 4.28, respectively; p < 0.046). Only 8.0% of the tumor patients on palliative care, but 63.6% of the HIV-positive patients realized that their medication was given with the objective to relieve symptoms (p < 0.001). When asked about additional goals of treatment, 48% of the palliative cancer patients and 15.1% of the HIV-positive patients checked ""cure"" (p < 0.002). In conclusion, particularly patients with curable cancer were afraid of information they might receive during the medical interview. Cancer patients considered themselves better informed compared to patients with HIV-infection. This is in significant contrast with the actual, measurable knowledge about their disease in the latter group. It is indeed surprising that only a small minority of incurable cancer patients realized that the goal of the medical care they received was relief of symptoms, the principle objective of palliation."
4172,0.005,1.0000,"Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is believed to be associated with reduced hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity and risk factors such as alcohol abuse and medication with oral contraceptives and certain other drugs. Recently it has been suggested that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may also be associated with PCT. We have therefore reviewed the prevalence of HCV infection in a series of patients with PCT in the Lothian region of Scotland. We identified 12 patients with PCT, all of whom had abnormal liver function tests. Liver histology revealed chronic active hepatitis in six patients, micronodular cirrhosis in four patients, hepatocellular carcinoma in one patient and normal findings in one HIV positive patient. Out of 12 patients tested, 11 were positive for anti-HCV antibodies by second generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA 2), and by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA 2); positive serology was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In a second group of 14 patients with chronic HCV infection matched for age and sex with the PCT patients, all had normal urinary uroporphyrin excretion. We have thus confirmed in Scotland early reports from Spain and Italy that PCT is strongly associated with HCV infection. This could explain the development of inflammatory changes in the liver and progression of liver disease in patients with PCT. Porphyrin metabolism, however, appears normal in patients with chronic HCV infection without PCT."
4253,0.005,1.0000,"Neurodevelopmental delay has been documented in up to 97.5% of HIV-infected children in Soweto who were not yet on antiretroviral treatment (ART). With growing numbers of children in South Africa being successfully treated with ART, the effects of ART on neurocognitive functioning in children require investigation. The objective of this study was to determine the extent of neurodevelopmental delay in stable HIV-infected preschool children (aged five to six years) receiving ART and compare it to an apparently healthy (unconfirmed HIV-status) group of preschool children. Thirty HIV-infected preschool children (virologically and immunologically stable on ART for more than one year) were conveniently sampled from 350 eligible children on ART at the Harriet Shezi Children's Clinic in Soweto, Johannesburg. The comparison group comprised 30 well-nourished preschool children attending the Lilian Ngoyi Primary Health Care Clinic in Soweto for routine immunizations. Each child was assessed using the Griffiths Mental Development Scales-Extended Revised Version (GMDS-ER), at a single point in time. The overall developmental z-scores on GMDS-ER were <-2 (indicating severe delay) in 27 (90%) children in the HIV-infected group compared to 23 (76%) in the comparison group (p = 0.166). Mental handicap (overall GQ < 70) was evident in 46.7% of children in the HIV-infected group compared to 10% in the comparison group (p = 0.002). There was a 7.88-fold increased likelihood of severe delay in the HIV infected group. The HIV-infected group and comparison group had significantly different (p = 0.001) mean overall GQ scores of 70 (95% CI: 66.0-74.0) and 78 (95% CI: 75.6-80.5), respectively, with lower mean scores in the HIV-infected group in all individual domains. Early initiation of ART in HIV-infected infants may improve cognitive functioning among this group; however, intervention strategies which optimize early cognitive development for all children in the area need to be urgently considered."
8086,0.005,1.0000,"In recent years, increasing numbers of patients infected with HIV-1 non-B subtypes have been treated with modern antiretroviral regimens. Therefore, a better knowledge of HIV drug resistance in non-B strains is crucial. Thus, we compared the mutational pathways involved in drug resistance among the most common non-B subtypes in Italy (F, C, and CRF02_AG) and the B subtype. In total, 2234 pol sequences from 1231 virologically failing patients from Central Italy were analyzed. The prevalence of resistance mutations in protease and reverse transcriptase between non-B and B subtypes has been evaluated. Among patients treated with nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and with thymidine analogues (TA) experience, TAMs1 M41L and L210W were less prevalent in CRF02_AG, while TAMs2 T215F and K219E were more prevalent in the F subtype. In NRTI-treated patients having experience with abacavir, didanosine, tenofovir, or stavudine the K65R mutation was mostly prevalent in the C subtype. In non-NRTI (NNRTI)-treated patients infected by the C subtype the prevalence of K103N was lower than in patients infected with other subtypes, while the prevalence of Y181C and Y188L was higher compared to subtype B. The prevalence of Y181C was higher also in subtype F as compared to subtype B. In patients treated with protease inhibitors, L89V was predominantly found in CRF02_AG, while the TPV resistance mutation T74P was predominantly found in the C subtype. Some differences in the genotypic drug resistance have been found among patients infected with B, C, F, and CRF02_AG subtypes in relationship to treatment. These results may be useful for the therapeutic management of individuals infected with HIV-1 non-B strains."

3843,0.005,1.0000,"Pulmonary hypertension is an important cause of dyspnoea in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) patients. The effect highly active antiretroviral therapy on pulmonary artery pressure has been an area of controversy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of antiretroviral therapy on pulmonary hypertension in HIV patients. This prospective cohort study was performed in a peripheral medical college of West Bengal with 88 patients from October 2008 to September 2011. By echocardiography, pulmonary artery pressure was recorded before initiation of antiretroviral therapy. After one year of antiretroviral therapy repeat echocardiography was done and pulmonary artery pressure was evaluated. The values were analysed. The present study showed that highly active antiretroviral therapy improves pulmonary artery pressure in HIV/AIDS patients if instituted at early stages (WHO classes I and II). However, at more advanced stages of pulmonary artery hypertension, it does not have any significant effect on reduction of the same. The present study documents that early detection of pulmonary artery hypertension in HIV/AIDS patients is essential and prompt institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy should be considered in them even when those patients do not fulfill the conventional criteria for initiation of this treatment."
5927,0.005,1.0000,"Early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) improves health outcomes and prevents HIV transmission. Before 2010, HIV testing was available to inmates in the California state prison system upon request. In 2010, the California Correctional Health Care Services (CCHCS) integrated HIV opt-out screening into the health assessment for inmates entering California state prisons. Under this system, a medical care provider informs the inmate that an HIV test is routinely done, along with screening for sexually transmitted, communicable, and vaccine-preventable diseases, unless the inmate specifically declines the test. During 2012-2013, CCHCS, the California Department of Public Health, and CDC evaluated HIV screening, rates of new diagnoses, linkage to and retention in care, ART response, and post-release linkage to care among California prison inmates. All prison inmates are processed through one of eight specialized reception center facilities, where they undergo a comprehensive evaluation of their medical needs, mental health, and custody requirements for placement in one of 35 state prisons. Among 17,436 inmates who entered a reception center during April-September 2012, 77% were screened for HIV infection; 135 (1%) tested positive, including 10 (0.1%) with newly diagnosed infections. Among the 135 HIV-positive patient-inmates, 134 (99%) were linked to care within 90 days of diagnosis, including 122 (91%) who initiated ART. Among 83 who initiated ART and remained incarcerated through July 2013, 81 (98%) continued ART; 71 (88%) achieved viral suppression (<200 HIV RNA copies/mL). Thirty-nine patient-inmates were released on ART; 12 of 14 who were linked to care within 30 days of release were virally suppressed at that time. Only one of nine persons with a viral load test conducted between 91 days and 1 year post-release had viral suppression. Although high rates of viral suppression were achieved in prison, continuity of care in the community remains a challenge. An infrastructure for post-release linkage to care is needed to help ensure sustained HIV disease control."

Few effective linkage-to-the-community programs are currently available for prisoners infected with HIV. As a result, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is seldom continued after release, and virological and immunological outcomes worsen. Poor HIV treatment outcomes result from a myriad of obstacles that released prisoners face upon reentering the community, including homelessness, lack of medical insurance, relapse to drug and alcohol use, and mental illness. This article will focus on 5 distinct factors that contribute significantly to treatment outcomes for released prisoners infected with HIV and have profound individual and public health implications: (1) adaptation of case management services to facilitate linkage to care; (2) continuity of cART; (3) treatment of substance use disorders; (4) continuity of mental illness treatment; and (5) reducing HIV-associated risk-taking behaviors as part of secondary prevention."

6658,0.005,1.0000,"The public sector scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa commenced in 2004. We aimed to describe the hospital-level disease burden and factors contributing to morbidity and mortality among hospitalized HIV-positive patients in the era of widespread ART availability. Between June 2012 and October 2013, unselected patients admitted to medical wards at a public sector district hospital in Cape Town were enrolled in this cross-sectional study with prospective follow-up. HIV testing was systematically offered and HIV-infected patients were systematically screened for TB. The spectrum of admission diagnoses among HIV-positive patients was documented, vital status at 90 and 180 days ascertained and factors independently associated with death determined. Among 1018 medical admissions, HIV status was ascertained in 99.5%: 60.1% (n = 609) were HIV-positive and 96.1% (n = 585) were enrolled. Of these, 84.4% were aware of their HIV-positive status before admission. ART status was naive in 35.7%, current in 45.0%, and interrupted in 19.3%. The most frequent primary clinical diagnoses were newly diagnosed TB (n = 196, 33.5%), other bacterial infection (n = 100, 17.1%), and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illnesses other than TB (n = 64, 10.9%). By 90 days follow-up, 175 (29.9%) required readmission and 78 (13.3%) died. Commonest causes of death were TB (37.2%) and other AIDS-defining illnesses (24.4%). Independent predictors of mortality were AIDS-defining illnesses other than TB, low hemoglobin, and impaired renal function. HIV still accounts for nearly two-thirds of medical admissions in this South African hospital and is associated with high mortality. Strategies to improve linkage to care, ART adherence/retention and TB prevention are key to reducing HIV-related hospitalizations in this setting."
5322,0.005,1.0000,"An estimated 3.2 million persons in the United States have chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Most new HCV transmissions occur among persons who inject drugs, often within the first few years of their injection drug use. During 2003-2012, reports of HCV infection increased from 15 to 54 cases per 100,000 among persons aged <30 years in Wisconsin, and 58% of persons in this age group with acute HCV infection reported injecting drugs (Wisconsin Division of Public Health, unpublished data, 2013). To increase detection of HCV infection, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health (WDPH) piloted a program during October 2012-October 2013 that offered rapid HCV testing to clients of four agencies providing outreach testing for HCV and human immunodeficiency virus infection, syringe exchange, counseling, and other harm reduction services to persons with drug dependence. During that period, 1,255 persons were tested using a rapid HCV test, and 246 (20%) of the results were positive. Most (72%) of the infections had not been reported to WDPH. A blood specimen for further testing was collected from 192 (78%) participants with positive HCV test results; among these participants, 183 were tested for HCV RNA using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and these results were positive for 128 (70%) participants, indicating active infection. Use of the rapid HCV test detected previously unreported HCV infections and raised awareness of HCV. Persons identified with active HCV infection should be referred to medical care and counseled on ways to prevent HCV transmission to others. "

9732,0.005,1.0000,"A decade has passed since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as standard of care for HIV/AIDS patients. The success of HAART is largely dependent on almost 100% adherence to it. In this study our primary aim was to understand from patients' own perspectives and experiences what resulted in them having 100% adherence to HAART. Thus, we purposefully recruited for in-depth interviews 10 participants (7 men and 3 women) with 100% adherence to HAART (>/=6 months previous to the interviews). All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by using Giorgi's phenomenological analysis approach. The following issues emerged from the analysis: readiness to go on HAART; HAART viewed as a life-line; maintenance of 100% adherence related with willingness to live longer and healthier; optimal ongoing patient-physician relationship, better coping and/or lack of perceived side effects; and improvements in clinical condition as well as in CD4 T-cells count and viral load reinforced the motivation to continue 100% adherence. The study findings should be helpful for health professionals caring for HIV-infected individuals on HAART."
6733,0.005,1.0000,"Evidence-based strategies to improve the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination coverage rates might help to reduce the burden caused by co-infection with HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this study, the aim was to evaluate the vaccination coverage and immunity against HBV among HIV-infected individuals in South Brazil, and identify factors that are associated with compliance patterns and antibody reactivity. Three hundred HIV-infected men and women were included in this survey. The patients answered a standardized questionnaire, and vaccination cards were checked in order to assess hepatitis B vaccine status. A blood sample was collected for quantitative determination of antibody to hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBs). Participants were also evaluated for their CD4 cell count and HIV viral load. The overall vaccination coverage of HBV vaccination found in this study (57.4%) was lower than that was previously reported in South Brazil. Anti-HBs levels >10IU/L were observed in 47.0% of the studied population. A significant inequality in the coverage rates and antibody reactivity was found in favor of patients with better economic status. In conclusion, the results indicate the need for improvement in the HBV vaccination coverage among HIV carriers, in particular focusing on low-income individuals. "
7979,0.005,1.0000,"The significance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes for the heterogeneity of chronic HBV infection and severity of liver disease is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and virologic characteristics of HBV genotypes in China and possible association with the diversity of liver disease. The study includes 1096 chronic HBV carriers from nine provinces in China. We collected clinical and laboratory data and analysed the HBV strains in sera by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and nucleotide sequencing techniques. The most common HBV genotypes were B (41%) and C (53%), while genotypes A and D were also found. A North-South divide was identified in genotype B and C distribution - genotype C was predominant in northern China, while genotype B was more prevalent in southern provinces. Patients with genotype B were younger than those with genotype C, and had a lower prevalence of HBeAg - 65%vs 72%, respectively (P = 0.03). However, the severity of liver disease did not differ significantly between patients infected with genotype B or C - neither when comparing liver function tests (1024 patients), nor hepatic inflammation and fibrosis (264 patients). Amongst 47 patients with genotype D (by PCR-RFLP), 37 (79%) were infected with a new subtype (designated Dc), having a recombination fragment from genotype C precore/core region. This is the first large-scale HBV genotype study from China and convincing documentation of the North-to-South gradient of genotypes C vs B in this country. HBV DNA recombination over the surface and precore/core genes increases the diversity of HBV strains and may have diagnostic and clinical implications."
9485,0.005,1.0000,"CD4 + lymphocyte counts are routinely ordered during the early phases of antiretroviral therapy and for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections in HIV-positive patients. Flow cytometry is the standard methodology for CD4 counts in Brazilian reference laboratories. However, these laboratories are located in large cities, frequently distant from patients, thus limiting patient access and delaying results. We compared a point-of-care test with flow cytometry determination of CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts in HIV patients. We analysed 107 consecutive samples by both methods. Overall, the point-of-care test performed well, with excellent agreement between it and the standard method. Test results were concordant for patients with CD4(+) T lymphocyte values above and below 200 cells/mm (3). The performance characteristics obtained were sensitivity 94% (95% CI 89.5-98.5%), specificity 93% (95% CI 88.2-97.8%), positive predictive value 86% (95% CI 79.4-92.6%), and negative predictive value 97% (95% CI 94-100%). The high sensitivity and specificity of the point-of-care test methodology suggest its utility as an alternative method for rapid measurement of CD4(+) T lymphocytes in patients with limited access to reference laboratories, enabling prompt therapeutic intervention for patients at risk of progression to AIDS.

9237,0.005,1.0000,"Immunoglobulin assays that are sensitive and specific for detecting human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection are especially important in developing countries where PCR and viral culture may not be readily available. Immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is elevated in HIV-1 infection, is the only antibody that does not cross the placenta, making it potentially valuable for viral detection in both children and adults. This study developed an assay for detection of HIV specific IgE antibodies in adults. A total of 170 serum samples from 170 adults (116 HIV positive and 54 HIV negative) were analyzed. Serum or plasma samples were treated by using the protein G affinity method. The HIV status was determined by using two IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and one Western blot evaluation. The IgE enzyme immunoassay test for HIV-1 correctly identified the HIV status in 98.8% of the samples (168 of 170). One false-positive and one false-negative test occurred with the IgE ELISA, as well as with the IgG ELISA test but were correctly identified by the IgE test. Analysis of the data demonstrated a high specificity (99%) and sensitivity (99%) of the IgE test, with 95% confidence intervals. The IgE assay appears to be sensitive and specific, suggesting that IgE-specific antibodies offer an effective method to detect HIV-1 infection in adults."

668,0.005,1.0000,"Human papilloma virus (HPV) causes focal infections of epithelial layers in skin and mucosa. HIV-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) appear to be at increased risk of developing HPV-induced oral warts. To identify the mechanisms that allow long-term infection of oral epithelial cells in these patients, we used a combination of laser-dissection microscopy (LDM) and highly sensitive and quantitative, non-biased, two-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR to study pathogen-induced alterations of specific tissue subcompartments. Expression of 166 genes was compared in three distinct epithelial and subepithelial compartments isolated from biopsies of normal mucosa from HIV-infected and non-infected patients and of HPV32-induced oral warts from HIV-infected patients. In contrast to the underlying HIV infection and/or HAART, which did not significantly elaborate tissue substructure-specific effects, changes in oral warts were strongly tissue substructure-specific. HPV 32 seems to establish infection by selectively enhancing epithelial cell growth and differentiation in the stratum spinosum and to evade the immune system by actively suppressing inflammatory responses in adjacent underlying tissues. With this highly sensitive and quantitative method tissue-specific expression of hundreds of genes can be studied simultaneously in a few cells. Because of its large dynamic measurement range it could also become a method of choice to confirm and better quantify results obtained by microarray analysis."
56,0.005,1.0000,"A biological method was developed for quantifying and cloning of infectious virions of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Virus preparations were mixed with permissive cells for binding, and the cells were cast in an agarose gel. After incubation for 9 days viral particles released from infected cells propagating from each initially infected cell were transferred on nylon membrane and subjected to hybridization using a radioactive HIV-1 DNA probe. Infectious centers of HIV-1 were detected as hybridization spots on autoradiographs regardless of cytopathic effects or syncytium formation. Three different CD4+ cell lines (MT-4, MOLT-4 and U937) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were used as recipient cells. Infectious virions were recovered from a portion of agarose gel corresponding to each hybridization spot. This assay is suitable for quantifying infectious HIV-1 virions with different cell tropisms and for investigating the relationship between the phenotype and genotype of HIV-1 at a clonal level."
1506,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy has increased the survival of patients with HIV/AIDS, thus necessitating health promotion practice with immunization. Vaccines are critical components for protecting people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The purpose of study was to analyze the vaccination status of PLWHA in outpatient care in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil. Cross-sectional study performed from June 2014 to June 2015. The screening was done with patients in antiretroviral therapy, 420 patients underwent screening, but only 99 met the inclusion criteria. Data were collected for interviews using forms to characterize sociodemographic, clinical and vaccination situations. Only 14 patients had complete vaccination schedules. The most used vaccines were hepatitis B, influenza vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal. There was no difference between men and women regarding the proportion of PLWHA with full vaccination schedule or between sex, skin color, marital status, sexual orientation, religion or occupational status. There was no difference between having or not having a complete vaccination schedule and age, years of education, family income or number of hospitalizations. CD4+ T-cells count of patients with incomplete immunization was lower than patients with complete immunization. Health education strategies can be done individually or in groups to explain the importance of vaccination and to remind about doses to be administered. Most patients did not have proper adherence to vaccination schedules, especially due to lack of guidance. Results implied that education in health is important for vaccination adhesion, knowledge of adverse events and continuation of schemes. "

The faith-based organisation, Gospel Health and Development Services, provides a home-based care programme for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) residing in Plateau State, Nigeria. This paper assesses the challenges that PLWHA in the programme faced while maintaining their health and livelihoods. The frustrations that volunteers endured in performing their work are also described, as well as the benefits and weaknesses of the programme from the perspective of PLWHA and their volunteer caregivers. Focus groups and interviews were done with 30 PLWHA and 22 volunteers to learn about their experiences with the home-based care programme and possible areas for its improvement. From these discussions three major challenges facing PLWHA emerged: discrimination towards PLWHA; the lack of money, food, and transport to health-care centres; and the desire for closer antiretroviral drug access."

Yet, there is limited knowledge of the forces that act as barriers to health-seeking behaviors among these women. In the analysis of this focus group study of 46 women with HIV, eight distinct categories of perceived barriers to care were identified. These were: Lack of knowledge on the part of health care providers, fear of negative treatment, insensitivity of health care providers, fear by providers, lack of patient education, lack of confidentiality, lack of honesty, and blaming the victim. The women's descriptions of their experiences with health care providers are presented and discussed in the context of the potential impact of such behaviors on women's willingness to accept or continue treatment for HIV infection."
748,0.005,1.0000,"Because many patients with acute hepatitis B lack detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), a radioimmunoassay for IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) was developed and evaluated as a diagnostic test. IgM anti-HBc was detected in each of 47 patients with acute hepatitis and transient HBsAg (geometric mean titer, greater than or equal to 1:191,000), but also in five of 12 HBsAg carriers (geometric mean titer, 1:459) and one of 46 healthy individuals positive for anti-HBc. However, it was not present in one patient during the first six months of a persistent infection. Of 255 patients with acute hepatitis and HBsAg and/or anti-HBc, 210 were HBsAg-positive whereas 230 had IgM anti-HBc. The latter was the only specific marker in 12.3% of all cases of acute hepatitis B. Thus, IgM anti-HBc is a valuable marker for the diagnosis of acute infection with hepatitis B virus."
2632,0.005,1.0000,"It has been estimated that there are more than 60 million Hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers in the World Health Organisation's Western Pacific region (WHO-WPR), where liver cancer is among the top three causes of cancer death. WHO and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention report the prevalence of HCV in the South Pacific islands (countries within the WHO-WPR) to be high (5-10% and >2% respectively). However, since HCV is not tested for in many of these countries, there is sparse data available to support this assertion. We screened ∼2000 apparently healthy individuals from Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Kiribati and found a sero-prevalence of 2.0%, 0.1% and 0%, respectively. All sero-positive samples tested negative for HCV RNA. Curious as to why all the sero-positive individuals were negative for HCV-RNA, we also screened them for the HCV protective IL28B SNP markers rs12979860 and rs8099917. All antibody-positive participants bar one had HCV protective haplotypes. Our results suggest that HCV is present in these Pacific island countries, albeit at a prevalence lower than previous estimates. As none of our participants had undergone antiviral treatment, and therefore must have cleared infection naturally, we hypothesise that genotypes 1 and/or 4 are circulating in South Pacific Island people and that these peoples are genetically predisposed to be more likely to spontaneous resolve HCV infection than to become chronic carriers.

219,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the incidence of clinically significant adverse events after long-term, fixed-dose, generic highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use among HIV-infected individuals in South India, we examined the experiences of 3154 HIV-infected individuals who received a minimum of 3 months of generic HAART between February 1996 and December 2006 at a tertiary HIV care referral center in South India. The most common regimens were 3TC + d4T + nevirapine (NVP) (54.8%), zidovudine (AZT) + 3TC + NVP (14.5%), 3TC + d4T + efavirenz (EFV) (20.1%), and AZT + 3TC + EFV (5.4%). The most common adverse events and median CD4 at time of event were rash (15.2%; CD4, 285 cells/microL) and peripheral neuropathy (9.0% and 348 cells/microL). Clinically significant anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dL) was observed in 5.4% of patients (CD4, 165 cells/microL) and hepatitis (clinical jaundice with alanine aminotransferase > 5 times upper limits of normal) in 3.5% of patients (CD4, 260 cells/microL). Women were significantly more likely to experience lactic acidosis, while men were significantly more likely to experience immune reconstitution syndrome (p < 0.05). Among the patients with 1 year of follow-up, NVP therapy was significantly associated with developing rash and d4T therapy with developing peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.05). Anemia and hepatitis often occur within 12 weeks of initiating generic HAART. Frequent and early monitoring for these toxicities is warranted in developing countries where generic HAART is increasingly available."
9865,0.005,1.0000,"Data on invasive cervical cancer (ICC) incidence in HIV-positive women and the effect of cervical cancer screening in sub-Saharan Africa are scarce. We estimated i) ICC incidence rates in women (≥18 years) who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the Themba Lethu Clinic (TLC) in Johannesburg, South Africa, between 2004 and 2011 and ii) the effect of a Pap-based screening program. We included 10,640 women; median age at ART initiation: 35 years [interquartile range (IQR) 30-42], median CD4 count at ART initiation: 113 cells/µL (IQR 46-184). During 27,257 person-years (pys), 138 women were diagnosed with ICC; overall incidence rate: 506/100,000 pys [95% confidence interval (CI) 428-598]. The ICC incidence rate was highest (615/100,000 pys) in women who initiated ART before cervical cancer screening became available in 04/2005 and was lowest (260/100,000 pys) in women who initiated ART from 01/2009 onward when the cervical cancer screening program and access to treatment of cervical lesions was expanded [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.42, 95% CI 0.20-0.87]. Advanced HIV/AIDS stage (4 versus 1, aHR 1.95, 95% CI 1.17-3.24) and middle age at ART initiation (36-45 versus 18-25 years, aHR 2.51, 95% CI 1.07-5.88) were risk factors for ICC. The ICC incidence rate substantially decreased with the implementation of a Pap-based screening program and improved access to treatment of cervical lesions. However, the risk of developing ICC after ART initiation remained high. To inform and improve ICC prevention and care for HIV-positive women in sub-Saharan Africa, implementation and monitoring of cervical cancer screening programs are essential."

Enteritis, bronchitis, urinary tract infections, and soft-tissue infections were also significantly associated with HIV infection. Cryptococcosis caused 44% of deaths among HIV-positive patients. Trauma was the main hazard for HIV-negative men, causing 42% of admissions and 60% of deaths. A broad range of infectious conditions is significantly associated with HIV infection in South African miners.

Targeted, affordable and evidence-based strategies to reach these populations are essential. Against this backdrop, a pilot project and situational assessment aimed at determining the context of psychological care and HIV treatment services in South Africa was undertaken. The situational analysis consisted of individual interviews, a patient survey, and a retrospective medical record data review. Training and mentorship were conducted from 2011 to 2013 by the Foundation for Professional Development (FPD) in five anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinics in the Tshwane-Metsweding area. Data were both descriptively and inferentially analysed. Outcomes indicate that the general structure of HIV services is well organised and well run in the sampled clinics. However, mental healthcare and HIV services need to be integrated further. There is also a need to develop and pilot-test appropriate materials and models for the delivery of mental healthcare within the parameters of affordability, acceptability and availability further, and to advocate the advancement of mental health and HIV treatment and policy integration."

However, HIV-viral hepatitis coinfections in countries endemic for these infections make management more difficult. To determine the extent of these coinfections in Gabon, we investigated markers of hepatitis B, C, and E viruses in 762 adults infected with HIV-1 by ELISA. We used real-time PCR to quantify plasma HBV DNA (HBV VL) and amplified HCV and HEV RNA by nested RT-PCR and PCR.The seroprevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection was 9.3 %. Among patients with isolated HBcAc profiles, the prevalence of occult hepatitis B infection was 26.7 %, for a real prevalence (detectable CV-HBV) of 17.3 % of the total population. HCV seroprevalence was 8.8 %. Of the 67 HIV-positive patients, 76.1 % had replicative profiles (detectable HCV RNA), that is, 6.7 % of the total population. For hepatitis E, seroprevalence was 3.5 %. No case of chronic HEV infection was found. In conclusion, this study highlights a high rate of HIV-Hepatitis B, C and E coinfections in Gabon. In addition, we show the interest of looking for chronic infections (replicative profiles) in HIV-infected patients in Gabon. The establishment of technical platforms for this type of research, accessible to middle-income countries, is necessary."
9472,0.005,1.0000,"Mycobacterial infection remains as a frequent complication associated to HIV infection. Although the widespread use of HAART has intensely decreased incidence of disseminated Mycobacterium avium (MAC) infection, it does not seem that it has affected tuberculosis occurrence so intensely. In spite of the intense search of new methods of rapid diagnosis, in the clinical practice the diagnosis of the mycobacterial illnesses continues based on culture, although the appearance of new media has allowed to shorten the time of growth. The combination of isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF) and pirazinamide (PZ) (with ethambutol [ETB] when primary resistance to INH is higher than 4%), remains as the elective treatment for tuberculosis in HIV infected patients. Due to the interaction between RIF and some antiretovirals drugs, such as proteasa inhibitors, a change in the usual regimens could be necessary. Combinations without RIF or antiretroviral therapy with drugs not interacting with RIF (nucleosides, ritonavir or nevirapin) have been suggested. The emergence of strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to the antituberculosis drugs, the lack of adherence to treatment, and the frequency of adverse events hinders even more the control of the tuberculosis and they demand a narrow follow up of these patients. The treatment of the disseminated infection by MAC has improved in the last years with the generalization of the combinations including macrolides as claritromicin or azitromicin with ETB. The doubt persists about what combination is more effective, although like in other opportunists infections associated with a severe immunodeficiency, using antiretrovirals combinations that enhance the immune system could be a fundamental therapeutic approach."
1831,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatocyte-specific DNA virus whose gene expression and replication are closely associated with hepatic metabolic processes. Thus, a potential anti-viral strategy is to target the host metabolic factors necessary for HBV gene expression and replication. Recent studies revealed that fatty acid translocase CD36 is involved in the replication, assembly, storage, and secretion of certain viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, the relationship between CD36 and the HBV life cycle remains unclear. Here, we showed, for the first time, that increased CD36 expression enhances HBV replication in HepG2.2.15 cells. To understand the underlying molecular basis, we performed genome-wide sequencing of the mRNA from HepG2.2.15-CD36 overexpression (CD36OE) cells and HepG2.2.15-vector cells using RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq) technology to analyze the differential transcriptomic profile. Our results identified 141 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to CD36 overexpression, including 79 upregulated genes and 62 downregulated genes. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that some of the DEGs were involved in various metabolic processes and the HBV life cycle. The reliability of the RNA-Seq data was confirmed by qPCR analysis. Our findings provide clues to build a link between CD36, host metabolism and the HBV life cycle and identified areas that require further investigation."
3142,0.005,1.0000,"The development of high-grade B-cell lymphoma in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) patients is a relatively late manifestation induced by Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV) infection and is considered to be an AIDS-defining condition. Multiple, ongoing molecular and cytogenetic aberrations appear necessary for the development of AIDS-related lymphoma. Studying a panel of human B-cell lines derived from patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and AIDS-associated Burkitt's lymphoma (AIDS-BL) we had described constitutive expression and secretion of large amounts of Interleukin-16 (IL-16), Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-1beta (MIP-1beta), Interleukin-12 (IL-12), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), and Interleukin-7 (IL-7). Some of these cytokines like IL-16, MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha and Regulated upon activation normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES) are shown to have inhibitory effect on HIV replication. Interestingly, we identified a novel transcription factor family, Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-1alpha Nuclear Protein (MNP), which is suggested as a potential target for anti-retroviral therapy based on the implication of its role and involvement as a key regulator of MIP-1alpha. It is apparent, that HIV induces the production of a cascade of cytokines and cytokine receptors. Some of these molecules serve to increase the infection and replication of HIV per se, and some others serve to induce a state of B-cell growth, activation, and differentiation. This review attempts to delineate the complex mechanisms of viral, B-cell, oncogene, cytokine/cytokine receptor and transcription factor interactions that are involved in AIDS associated lymphomagenesis. Unfolding the relationship between cytokines and the underlying mechanisms of the disease will not only help in understanding the pathophysiology but also will facilitate focusing on the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."
8737,0.005,1.0000,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected cats enter a clinically asymptomatic phase during chronic infection. Despite the lack of overt clinical disease, the asymptomatic phase is characterized by persistent immunologic impairment. In the peripheral blood obtained from cats experimentally infected with FIV-C for approximately 5 years, we identified a persistent inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio. We cloned and sequenced the FIV-C long terminal repeat containing the viral promoter from cells infected with the inoculating virus and from in vivo-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4 T cells isolated at multiple time points throughout the asymptomatic phase. Relative to the inoculating virus, viral sequences amplified from cells isolated from all of the infected animals demonstrated multiple single nucleotide mutations and a short deletion within the viral U3, R and U5 regions. A transcriptionally inactivating proviral mutation in the U3 promoter AP-1 site was identified at multiple time points from all of the infected animals but not within cell-associated viral RNA. In contrast, no mutations were identified within the sequence of the viral dUTPase gene amplified from PBMC isolated at approximately 5 years post-infection relative to the inoculating sequence. The possible implications of these mutations to viral pathogenesis are discussed. "

2466,0.005,1.0000,"Our work aimed to examine the potential influence of variants in interleukin/interleukin receptors genes on high-risk (HR-HPV) HPV clearance. Clearance of genital HR-HPV infection was evaluated for 134 HIV-1 seropositive African-American female adolescents from the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) cohort. Genotyping targeted 225 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the exons, 5' untranslated region (UTR) and 3' UTR sequences of 27 immune-related candidate genes encoding interleukin family of cytokines. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the association of type-specific HPV clearance adjusting for time-varying CD4+ T-cell count and low-risk (LR-HPV) HPV co-infections. HR-HPV clearance rates were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with five SNPs (rs228942, rs419598, rs315950, rs7737000, and rs9292618) mapped to coding and regulatory regions in three genes (IL2RB, IL1RN, and IL7R). These data suggest that the analyzed genetic variants in interleukin family of cytokines modulate HR-HPV clearance in HIV-1 seropositive African-Americans that warrants replication."
6670,0.005,1.0000,"Drug allergy is the most common and significant allergic manifestation of HIV3 infection. Initially described in patients treated with SMX-TMP for PCP, allergy is now known to involve a multitude of drugs. The pathogenesis of, and risk factors for, allergy in HIV infection are poorly understood, although there is evidence suggesting that allergy is more common with advancing immunodeficiency. HIV-negative subjects with sulfonamide allergy may have drug-specific antibodies and drug metabolite-induced lymphocyte cytotoxicity, abnormalities that could partly explain the allergic mechanisms and which may have future diagnostic potential; these abnormalities have not been described in HIV-infected subjects. Therapy includes avoidance, suppressive agents such as corticosteroids, and desensitization, although the appropriate role for each is not entirely clear. Serum IgE levels have been shown to rise with progressive disease; those patients with higher levels may have a worse prognosis. The mechanisms of this rise are multifactorial, probably a combination of altered T-lymphocyte regulation of IgE synthesis and of production of specific IgE directed against microbial antigens."
2948,0.005,1.0000,"HIV/HCV coinfected patients tend to develop hepatitis C (HCV)-associated liver disorders. Because the chemokine receptor CXCR3 participates in lymphocyte trafficking during hepatic inflammation, it may participate in the escalated liver disorders of coinfected patients. However, to date, the relative frequency and density of receptor on lymphocytes has not been established. This study compared the CXCR3(+) phenotype under various in vitro conditions between lymphocytes from healthy and coinfected individuals. Peripheral lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagluttinin for 0-7 d and phenotypes were determined by flow cytometry. Secreted cytokines were measured in culture supernatants by ELISA. Phenotypic differences were observed between groups. CD4(+)CXCR3(+) frequency between groups was equivalent before and during early activation, but increased only among non-infected individuals during late activation (p<0.001). In contrast, CD8(+)CXCR3(+) frequency was consistently greater (p<0.05) among HIV/HCV patients throughout activation. Among those who were non-infected, CD8(+)CXCR3(+) frequency increased (p=0.002) during late activation. However, CD8(+)CXCR3(+) frequency among HIV/HCV patients increased within 24 h of activation (p=0.008), and was nearly universal by late activation (p<0.001). Both groups elaborated Th-1 cytokine profiles; however, coinfected patients released more inflammatory cytokines (p<0.01) than non-infected individuals. In summary, we demonstrated that CD8(+) lymphocytes from HIV/HCV-infected patients expressed more CXCR3 and showed greater upregulatory ability upon activation. The atypical CXCR3 expression and enhanced Th-1 cytokine elaboration among coinfected patients could potentially stimulate increased lymphocyte migration during hepatic inflammation."
4340,0.005,1.0000,"Women in developing countries often present for medical care with advanced cervical cancer, although this condition is preventable through regular screening and early treatment. This study sought to identify the prevalence and risk factors for cervical dyskaryosis among women in Zimbabwe with and without HIV. In a cross-sectional study, 200 consenting women were screened for cervical dyskaryosis and sexually transmitted infections (STI). The relationship between various risk factors for cervical dyskaryosis was examined. The overall prevalence of cervical dyskaryosis was high (19%), and significantly higher among HIV-infected women at 30% compared with 13% among seronegative women, with a peak at a younger age among seropositive women. Use of intravaginal herbs, practising intravaginal cleansing, being single, a history of three or more lifetime sexual partners and a history of previous STI were associated with cervical dysplasia. The high frequency of cervical abnormality lends weight to the demand for implementation of regular screening programmes and health education."
9648,0.005,1.0000,"Cigarette smoking among people living with HIV/AIDS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but findings regarding the association between cigarette smoking and HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts have been inconsistent. This study characterized the prevalence of cigarette smoking among HIV-infected Russian women and examined the association between smoking frequency and quantity and HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. HIV-infected Russian women (N = 250; M age = 30.0) in St. Petersburg, Russia, completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview survey assessing cigarette use, antiretroviral medication adherence, and provided blood samples assayed for HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. The majority (60.4%) reported cigarette smoking in the past month; 49.0% of recent smokers were classified as moderate or heavy smokers, defined as smoking ≥10 cigarettes daily. Viral load status did not differ between infrequent smokers and regular smokers. However, moderate/heavy smokers (relative to light smokers) were more likely to have a detectable viral load (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.1). There were no significant differences in CD4+ lymphocyte counts by smoking frequency or quantity of cigarettes smoked. Results highlight the need for additional research to examine the association between cigarette smoking and virologic suppression and markers of HIV disease progression. Adverse health consequences of cigarette smoking coupled with a potential link between heavy smoking and poor virologic suppression highlight the need for assessment of cigarette use and provision of evidence-based smoking-cessation interventions within HIV medical care."
7338,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is associated with variable rates of disease progression, influenced by the quality of CD8 T-lymphocyte response, which is determined by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) I alleles. Some individuals progress slowly and maintain viral control, while at the opposite end of the spectrum some individuals endure a faster progression with rapid CD4 decline. We sought to determine the role of HLA-B allele frequency on rapid HIV disease progression. It was hypothesized that rapid progression is associated with the presence of high allele frequency of HLA-B35 and HLA-B homozygocity."
2728,0.005,1.0000,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are part of the cellular immune response to human persistent virus infections. Measurements of the frequency and specificity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CTL and their variation with time may indicate their relative importance in modulating the progression of HIV-1 infection. We have used limiting dilution analysis (LDA) to derive quantitative estimates of the frequency of HIV-1-specific CTL precursors in a cross-sectional study of 23 patients at different clinical stages of HIV-1 infection and to compare these with the frequency of CTL precursors specific for another persistent virus (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]) in the same patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated in vitro with autologous HIV-1-infected lymphoblasts and assayed for cytotoxicity in 51Cr release assays against autologous and MHC-mismatched lymphoblastoid B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the three HIV-1 structural gene products. The frequency of MHC-restricted precursors was high in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (env-specific CTL precursors up to 73/10(6) PBMC; gag-specific CTL precursors up to 488/10(6) PBMC), although the relative frequency against the different structural gene products varied from patient to patient. The HIV-1-specific CTL precursor frequency was reduced in patients who had more severe (< 400/microliters) CD4+ lymphocyte depletion, while in the majority of such patients the frequency of CTL precursors against EBV was maintained at levels observed in healthy controls. Direct CTL activity in unstimulated PBMC was observed in three of nine patients but no correlation was found between the presence of an activated CTL response and the magnitude of the CTL response detected after stimulation in LDA. Thus, CTL precursors were detected against all three HIV-1 structural gene products in patients with CD4+ lymphocyte counts > 400/microliters, at frequencies that are high compared with those reported for other persistent viruses. A CTL response directed against multiple protein antigens of HIV-1 may protect the patient against epitope variation. The fact that the EBV-specific CTL precursor frequencies were maintained in advanced HIV-1 infection suggests that there may be selective impairment of the HIV-1-specific CTL response associated with disease progression."
3852,0.005,1.0000,"Prevalence and clinical features of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related thrombocytopenia have been investigated among a random population of 657 anti-HIV-positive individuals. A platelet count below 100 X 10(9)/liter was detected in 72 patients (10.9%). Compared with anti-HIV-positive controls with normal platelets, a significantly higher prevalence of males (p less than 0.02) and of intravenous drug abusers (p less than 0.02) as well as a higher frequency of patients with advanced HIV-related disease (p less than 0.001) were detected among thrombocytopenic patients. Those patients whose thrombocytopenia was associated with neutropenia and/or anemia (14 cases, 2.1%) clearly differed from patients with isolated thrombocytopenia (IT) (58 cases, 8.8%) since they belonged to the more advanced groups of the CDC classification of HIV-related disorders, had lower CD4-positive lymphocyte counts, a higher frequency of cutaneous anergy, and less persistent thrombocytopenia. In the cohort of patients with persistent IT (47 cases), no single epidemiological or clinical data proved to correlate with the severity of thrombocytopenia. They did not differ significantly from anti-HIV-positive controls in their distribution among CDC groups, but the total lymphocyte and the CD4-positive lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in IT patients belonging to CDC group II (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.02, respectively) and III (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.005, respectively) compared with CDC group-matched controls; after a median followup of one year, the two cohorts showed similar rates of progression to CDC Group IV."
8428,0.005,1.0000,"As Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is scaled up in low- and middle-income countries, it is important to understand Quality of Life (QOL) correlates including disease severity and person characteristics and to determine the extent of between-country differences among those with HIV. QOL and medical data were collected from 1,563 of the 1,571 participants at entry into a randomized clinical trial of ART conducted in the U.S. (n = 203) and 8 resource-limited countries (n = 1,360) in the Caribbean, South America, Asia, and Africa. Participants were interviewed prior to initiation of ART using a modified version of the ACTG SF-21, a health-related QOL measure including 8 subscales: general health perception, physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, pain, mental health, and energy/fatigue. Other measures included demographics, CD4+ lymphocyte count, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load. Higher quality of life in each of the 8 QOL subscales was associated with higher CD4+ lymphocyte category. General health perception, physical functioning, role functioning, and energy/fatigue varied by plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load categories. Each QOL subscale included significant variation by country. Only the social functioning subscale varied by sex, with men having greater impairments than women, and only the physical functioning subscale varied by age category. This was the first large-scale international ART trial to conduct a standardized assessment of QOL in diverse international settings, thus demonstrating that implementation of the behavioral assessment was feasible. QOL indicators at study entry varied with disease severity, demographics, and country. The relationship of these measures to treatment outcomes can and should be examined in clinical trials of ART in resource-limited settings using similar methodologies."

242,0.005,1.0000,"To assess the epidemiology of infection with the delta agent associated with hepatitis B virus, sera from 1314 carriers of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 687 patients with hepatitis B collected in 1978-1981 from different regions of Italy were tested for delta antigen and antibody to the antigen (anti-delta), and the characteristics of delta-positive patients were analyzed. Anti-delta was found in each center participating in the study, indicating that delta infection has spread throughout Italy. Its prevalence was higher in carriers in southern Italy and in those with chronic hepatitis. In northern Italy, delta infection predominated among southern emigrants in industrial towns but also among parenteral drug addicts with hepatitis B virus infection. The prevalence of delta markers was variable and generally low in acute hepatitis B, suggesting that in Italy self-limited forms of delta infection occur sporadically or by limited outbreaks. Delta infection appears to be endemic in southern Italy but a new epidemiologic event in northern Italy, where it was probably introduced by southern emigrants and is presently exceeding its ethnic confinement to spread selectively in communities of drug addicts. Presumably, the endemicity of delta is maintained by transmission of this agent from carrier to carrier of the HBsAg."
8613,0.005,1.0000,"Glial inflammation, principally involving astrocytes and microglia, underlies the pathogenesis of a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders, including, most notably, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)-associated dementia. Indeed, for the latter, disease mechanisms are attributed to viral infection and activation of microglia and perivascular macrophages and their resultant neurotoxic activities. Although monocyte-derived macrophages have served as models for microglia, they are limited both qualitatively and quantitatively in their immune responses and susceptibility to viral infection. Thus, the acquisition of primary human microglial cells is critical for laboratory studies of human neurological disease. In this chapter, we provide detailed methods of isolation, cultivation, characterization, HIV-1 infection, and experimental applications of primary human fetal and adult microglial cells, with particular emphasis on studies of HIV-1 neuropathogenesis."
2700,0.005,1.0000,"To evaluate the presence and distribution of central nervous system infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), we used immunohistochemical methods to map the HIV-1 p24 core protein in the brains of 55 autopsied patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In a subset of 40 of these patients who had undergone antemortem neurological evaluation of the AIDS dementia complex (ADC), we analyzed the relation between the severities of the viral infection and clinical dysfunction. Viral antigen was detected in macrophages and cells with morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of microglia as well as multinucleated cells. The distribution of antigen-positive cells preferentially involved certain deep brain structures, especially the globus pallidus, other basal ganglia nuclei, and the central white matter. Overall, the presence and frequency of infected cells were highly correlated with the histological findings of multinucleated-cell encephalitis and in general with the clinical ADC stage. However, infection was often more limited than might be ""anticipated"" from the severity of patients' clinical dysfunction: Only 61% of patients with at least ADC stage 1 had detectable antigen and of these only approximately 30% of the brain sections were antigen positive. These results suggest a pathogenetic model of ADC where virus- or cell-coded toxins amplify the effect of limited brain infection."
8606,0.005,1.0000,"CSF protein and cellular profiles were studied in 28 HIV-infected patients. Twenty of them had neurological complaints, but only 6 patients had objective neurological deficits such as dementia, ocular motility disorders or polyneuropathy. The serum/CSF HIV antibody ratio was on average lowest in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (4 patients) and highest or almost normal in lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS) (11) and asymptomatic seropositivity (ASX) (7), while it varied between these extremes in AIDS-related complex (ARC) (6). However, low values of the ratio were also found in the HIV-infected patients free of neurological symptoms and even in one ASX patient. The CSF IgG index was elevated in all these 4 general stages of HIV infection without any significant differences between them. The CSF/serum albumin ratio was slightly increased in patients with neurological deficits, but this ratio showed no association with any other clinical factor analysed. CSF leucocytes were increased in the early stages of the disease, but later the cellular reaction subsided. HIV was isolated from post mortem brain tissue of two AIDS patients and from the CSF of one of them. The results suggest increased intrathecal virus-specific IgG synthesis, not only in patients with neurological deficits and at advanced stages of infection, but also in neurologically symptom-free subjects and at early infection. The lack of correlation between the increased virus-specific IgG synthesis within the CNS and the presence of neurological symptoms suggests that neurologically ""silent"" areas of brain white matter are often affected in HIV infection."

The incidence of clinically overt toxoplasmosis was about 20% in the 167 hospitalized persons infected with the parasite. In 29% of 68 patients with suspected pneumocystosis, the infection could be verified. In 9% of 219 patients, Cryptosporidium sp. was found. In two persons, an infection with Strongyloides stercoralis was diagnosed. Except these AIDS-associated opportunistic infections, the incidence of parasitic infections in the Austrian HIV-infected population was found to be low, and, except for Entamoeba histolytica, not significantly exceeding the frequency of parasitic infections in non-HIV-infected Austrians. Compared to data on the frequency of opportunistic infections in AIDS-patients in other developed countries, toxoplasmosis as well as infections with Cryptosporidium sp. seem to be more often diagnosed in Austria, whereas pneumocystosis is slightly less frequently found."

Antiretroviral drugs (ARV) have been smuggled into the country and available without prescription since the early 1990s, but are now provided free of cost by the government. We assessed the prevalence of HIV-1, drug resistance, and subtype distributions. Blood specimens were collected from HIV-1-infected participants registered in Sindh Province on dry blood spot (DBS) cards in 2008. Pol, protease, and partial reverse transcriptase regions were sequenced after reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). HIV-1 subtype was assigned by phylogenetic analysis. Primary drug resistance was analyzed by the Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool using the Stanford Surveillance Drug Resistance Mutation (SDRM) major mutation list. Out of 100 blood samples collected, 42 were suitable for testing. Out of 42, 11 were ARV-receiving and 31 ARV-naive patients. Among them, 24 were injection drug users (IDUs), four immigrants, two hijras (male transvestites), two men who have sex with men (MSM), four prisoners, one female sex workers, two spouses of HIV-infected persons, and four from the general population. ARV resistance among naive patients was 2/31 (6.5%) and 36.4% (4/11) among ARV-experienced patients making an overall resistance of 14.2%. HIV-1 subtype A1 was the predominant subtype found in 35/42 (83.3%) followed by CRF35_AD and C, 6.5% each. Subtype D and G were found in one (2.4%) each.

458,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is known to increase the risk of death from severe liver disease and, because HCV status is strongly associated with a history of injecting drug use, the effect of a key disease progression cofactor, infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is of interest. We examined all-cause, liver-related and drug-related mortality and excess risk of death from these causes in a large cohort of HCV-monoinfected and HIV-coinfected persons in Scotland. The study population consisted of 20,163 persons confirmed to be infected with hepatitis C through laboratory testing in Scotland between 1991 and 2005. Records with sufficient identifiers were linked to the General Register Office for Scotland death register to retrieve associated mortality data, and were further linked to a national database of HIV-positive individuals to determine coinfection status. A total of 1715 HCV monoinfected and 305 HIV coinfected persons died of any cause during the follow-up period (mean of 5.4 and 6.4 years, respectively). Significant excess mortality was observed in both HCV monoinfected and HIV coinfected populations from liver-related underlying causes (standardised mortality ratios of 25, 95% CI = 23-27; and 37, 95% CI = 26-52 for the two groups, respectively) and drug-related causes (25, 95% CI = 23-27; 39, 95% CI = 28-53. The risk of death from hepatocellular carcinoma, alcoholic or non-alcoholic liver disease, or from a drug-related cause, was greatly increased compared with the general Scottish population, with the highest standardised mortality ratio observed for hepatocellular carcinoma in the monoinfected group (70, 95% CI = 57-85). This study has revealed considerable excess mortality from liver- and drug-related causes in the Scottish HCV-diagnosed population; these data are crucial to inform on the clinical management, and projected future public health burden, of HCV infection."
2302,0.005,1.0000,"The genetic diversity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains has evolved through mutations such as point mutations, deletions or insertions, and recombination. We identified and characterized a novel type of mutation which is a complex of external insertion, deletion, and internal duplication in sequences from one of six patients with chronic hepatitis B virus genotype E (HBV/E). We provisionally named this mutation a ""replacement mutation""; the core promoter upstream regulatory sequence/basic core promoter was replaced with a part of the S1 promoter covering the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) binding site, followed by a tandem repeat of the HNF1 site. A longitudinal analysis of the HBV population over 6 years showed the clonal change from wild-type HBV/E to replacement-mutant type, resulting in a lower hepatitis B (HB) e antigen titer, a high HBV DNA level in serum, and progression of liver fibrosis. In an in vitro study using a replication model, the replacement-mutant HBV showed higher replication levels than the wild-type HBV/E replicon, probably mediated by altered transcription factor binding. Additionally, this HNF1 site replacement mutation was associated with excessive HB nucleocapsid protein expression in hepatocytes, in both in vivo and in vitro studies. This novel mutation may be specific to HBV genotype E, and its prevalence requires further investigation."

During the first 11 months of the program, testing was offered at 20,843 patient visits and was accepted at 15,181 (73%) of these; 612 (4%) individual clients had results that were positive for HIV. Four hundred thirty-seven (71%) seropositive clients returned for test results, post-test counseling, and further evaluation. Most HIV-infected clients were single, and black men accounted for 75% of seropositive individuals. HIV-infected women tended to be younger than infected men (7% of the female clients were adolescents). Although homosexual activity, intravenous drug use, and sex with a partner at risk were common risk factors for seropositive clients, after two interviews 17% of men and 38% of infected women did not report traditional risk factors for HIV infection. Most clients were asymptomatic or had generalized lymphadenopathy at the time of HIV diagnosis. Health care resources for these individuals were limited; 62% of men and 85% of women either had no health insurance or received public assistance. Routine, voluntary, confidential HIV counseling and testing is a practical, effective means to identify HIV-infected individuals among clients being treated at STD clinics. Identification of these individuals early in the course of infection provides opportunities to implement early follow-up and therapy, to counsel clients to help prevent further spread of infection, and to obtain useful information for projecting future health care needs and policy."
5256,0.005,1.0000,"To assess the prevalence and associated risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in patients attending inner-city clinics for sexually transmitted diseases in Baltimore, we screened 4028 patients anonymously, of whom 209 (5.2 percent) were seropositive for HIV. HIV-seropositivity rates were higher among men (6.3 percent) than women (3.0 percent) (P less than 0.001) and among blacks (5.0 percent) than whites (1.2 percent) (P less than 0.02). Among men, but not women, HIV seroprevalence increased markedly and steadily up to the age of 40. In men, HIV seropositivity was independently associated with increased age, black race, a history of homosexual contact, and the use of parenteral drugs. In women, a history of parenteral drug use or of being a sexual partner of a bisexual man or parenteral drug user were independently predictive of HIV seropositivity. In men, HIV seropositivity was also associated with a history of syphilis or a reactive serologic test for syphilis, and in women, with a history of genital warts. Since these associations were independent of the type and number of reported sexual partners, they raise the possibility that sexually transmitted diseases that disrupt epithelial surfaces may be important in the transmissibility of HIV. In addition, on a self-administered questionnaire, one third of HIV-infected men and one half of infected women did not acknowledge previous high-risk behavior for HIV exposure. These data suggest that patients at clinics for sexually transmitted diseases represent a group at high risk for HIV infection, and that screening, counseling, and intensive education should be offered to all patients attending such clinics."

Seven of eight hypogonadal men (88 percent) had a normal gonadotropin response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone administration. Hypogonadism correlated with lymphocyte depletion and weight loss. Adrenal cortisol reserve, evaluated by adrenocorticotropin stimulation, was normal in 36 of 39 patients (92 percent) with AIDS. Indices of thyroid function were normal with the exception of one ARC man with a low free thyroxine index. In conclusion, hypogonadism is common in men with HIV infection and may be the first or most sensitive endocrine abnormality."
1937,0.005,1.0000,"Lesotho, a small, mountainous country completely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa, has a population of approximately 2 million persons with an estimated gross national income of $1,280 per capita; 73% of the population resides in rural areas (1). Lesotho has a generalized human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic (2). In 2014, the prevalence of HIV infection among persons aged 15-49 years was 24.6%, with an incidence of 1.9 new infections per 100 person-years of exposure (3). As the leading cause of premature death, HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) has contributed to Lesotho's reporting the shortest life expectancy at birth among 195 countries and territories (4). In 2015, antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage among HIV-positive persons in Lesotho was estimated to be 42% (5). In April 2016, Lesotho became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to adopt the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for universal initiation of antiretroviral therapy for all HIV-positive persons, regardless of CD4 count (known as the ""Test and Start"" program or approach), with nationwide implementation occurring in June 2016 (6,7). Before implementation of Test and Start, many persons living with HIV infection in Lesotho were not eligible to initiate treatment until their CD4 count was <500 cells/mm"
1150,0.005,1.0000,"Substantial changes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related sexual behavior have been reported by virtually every survey of homosexual/bisexual men in the last decade. This paper uses a behavior-based simulation to examine how such changes are likely to affect the long-term future of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic among homosexual men. Data from the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project in New York City are used to estimate age-specific patterns of unprotected anogenital contact and behavioral change from 1980 to 1991. Model projections are validated using New York City surveillance data on AIDS incidence from 1981 to 1991. The current levels of unsafe sex reported in the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project are shown to be almost exactly on the epidemic threshold. If this behavior were maintained, HIV prevalence would slowly decline in the population, but with just one additional unsafe sexual partner per year HIV would instead become endemic, with seroprevalence of about 65% in the oldest group and about 25% in the youngest. Transmission dynamics in the youngest group are analyzed in detail. For this group, the assortative age-matching bias in partner selection patterns raises the unsafe behavior threshold slightly in the long run."
5267,0.005,1.0000,"A blinded seroprevalence survey for HIV-1 infection was conducted among individuals entering New York City (NYC) prisons in 1989. Data collected included age group, race/ethnicity, syphilis serologic results and self-admitted drug use. Remnant serum specimens were tested for HIV-1 antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by Western blot. Of 2236 inmates surveyed, 413 (18.5%) were HIV-1 positive. Rates varied by subgroup, and were higher for women than men (25.8 versus 16.1%; odds ratio 1.8; P less than 0.01), for drug users than inmates who denied drug use (25 versus 14%; odds ratio 2.3; P less than 0.01), for intravenous heroin users (43 versus 15% in drug users not using heroin), and for inmates with positive rapid plasma reagin test (RPR) results (34.5 versus 16.1% in RPR-negative inmates). Use of intravenous heroin was most strongly related, by logistic regression, to HIV-1 seropositivity. The results are among the highest found in US inmates, and suggest that there were 12,500 seropositive individuals incarcerated in 1989. This represents approximately 10% of the estimated number of seropositive individuals in NYC. The NYC Correctional System should be viewed as a front-line institution in the fight against AIDS through provision of HIV-related prevention services and clinical care, and drug treatment."
1997,0.005,1.0000,"Clinical trials of antiretroviral drugs can take years to complete because the outcomes measured are progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or death. Trials could be accelerated by the use of end points such as changes in CD4+ lymphocyte counts and plasma levels of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA and beta 2-microglobulin, but there is uncertainty about whether these surrogate measures are valid predictors of disease progression."
8611,0.005,1.0000,"Approximately 50% of late-stage HIV patients develop CXCR4-tropic (X4) virus in addition to CCR5-tropic (R5) virus. X4 emergence occurs with a sharp decline in CD4+ T cell counts and accelerated time to AIDS. Why this phenotypic switch to X4 occurs is not well understood. Previously, we used numerical simulations of a mathematical model to show that across much of parameter space a promising new class of antiretroviral treatments, CCR5 inhibitors, can accelerate X4 emergence and immunodeficiency. Here, we show that mathematical model to be a minimal activation-based HIV model that produces a spontaneous switch to X4 virus at a clinically-representative time point, while also matching in vivo data showing X4 and R5 coexisting and competing to infect memory CD4+ T cells. Our analysis shows that X4 avoids competitive exclusion from an initially fitter R5 virus due to X4v unique ability to productively infect nave CD4+ T cells. We further justify the generalized conditions under which this minimal model holds, implying that a phenotypic switch can even occur when the fraction of activated nave CD4+ T cells increases at a slower rate than the fraction of activated memory CD4+ T cells. We find that it is the ratio of the fractions of activated nave and memory CD4+ T cells that must increase above a threshold to produce a switch. This occurs as the concentration of CD4+ T cells drops beneath a threshold. Thus, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which increases CD4+ T cell counts and decreases cellular activation levels, inhibits X4 viral growth. However, we show here that even in the simplest dual-strain framework, competition between R5 and X4 viruses often results in accelerated X4 emergence in response to CCR5 inhibition, further highlighting the potential danger of anti-CCR5 monotherapy in multi-strain HIV infection."
7041,0.005,1.0000,"Ninety-nine patients at Center for Disease Control (CDC) clinical stage IV were studied. Twelve (12.12%) of these patients turned out to be HIV seronegative. Ten out of the 12 HIV negative patients were immunocompetent whereas the other two had proportional decreases in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes. HIV-1, HIV-2, and dual infection, were detected in 51.5%, 2%, and 22.2% respectively of clinical AIDS patients. The other 12.12% of clinical AIDS patients were indeterminate for HIV antibodies. All HIV positive patients with the exception of two, were immunocompromised with respect to CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte counts. Two healthy spouses and three children of patients who died from the disease were seronegative for HIV antibodies. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibody titres were higher in HIV infected than uninfected blood. Patients with chronic diarrhoea, lymphadenopathy, pneumonia, and tuberculosis, either alone or in combination of two or more of such symptoms, were found to be more likely to be confirmed by serology and immunology as definitive AIDS patients in Ghana. In postmortem studies on 20 patients, pneumonia due to tuberculosis constituted the major cause of death. Toxoplasmosis, cytomegaloviral eosophagitis and enteritis, and cryptococcosis were the major opportunistic infections detected. Programmed cell death (apoptosis) was found by the DNA gel electrophoresis method to be an unlikely major mechanism of accelerated culture induced death of PBMCs from CDC stage IV AIDS patients."
7327,0.005,1.0000,"Nef is a multifunctional protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) required for high viral replication and disease progression. Several findings indicate that the capacity of Nef to downregulate surface CD4 is essential for the protein's pathogenic activity, although the mechanisms that link the two functions are yet unclear. It is believed that, by reducing surface CD4 levels, Nef counteracts the receptor's negative effects on virion infectivity and release. Here, we show that, in 293T cells co-expressing CD4 and HIV-1, the capacity of Nef to enhance the virion incorporation of Env products and release of viral particles was mediated by retention-degradation of neo-synthesized CD4 rather than by accelerated receptor endocytosis. Different results were observed in primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes in which Nef-mediated CD4 downregulation occurs primarily by accelerated internalization. In HIV-infected T cell cultures, Nef was crucial for the removal of surface CD4 at the beginning of the infection, while later on maximal CD4 downregulation was achieved in a Nef-independent manner. Moreover, by means of in vivo selected Nef mutants, we observed that CD4 downregulation is not essential for Nef ability to enhance Env incorporation into virions and increase viral infectivity or replication in CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Notably, Nef expression itself was dispensable for efficient release of HIV-1 particles by T cells. In conclusion, we propose that the CD4 downregulation activity of Nef plays a role before the late productive phases of HIV-1 replication."
3007,0.005,1.0000,"Low vitamin D levels in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV) infected persons are associated with more rapid disease progression and increased risk for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We have previously shown that 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25D3), the active form of vitamin D, inhibits HIV replication in human macrophages through the induction of autophagy. In this study, we report that physiological concentrations of 1,25D3 induce the production of the human cathelicidin microbial peptide (CAMP) and autophagic flux in HIV and M. tuberculosis co-infected human macrophages which inhibits mycobacterial growth and the replication of HIV. Using RNA interference for Beclin-1 and the autophagy-related 5 homologue, combined with the chemical inhibitors of autophagic flux, bafilomycin A₁, an inhibitor of autophagosome-lysosome fusion and subsequent acidification, and SID 26681509 an inhibitor of the lysosome hydrolase cathepsin L, we show that the 1,25D3-mediated inhibition of HIV replication and mycobacterial growth during single infection or dual infection is dependent not only upon the induction of autophagy, but also through phagosomal maturation. Moreover, through the use of RNA interference for CAMP, we demonstrate that cathelicidin is essential for the 1,25D3 induced autophagic flux and inhibition of HIV replication and mycobacterial growth. The present findings provide a biological explanation for the benefits and importance of vitamin D sufficiency in HIV and M. tuberculosis-infected persons, and provide new insights into novel approaches to prevent and treat HIV infection and related opportunistic infections."
2679,0.005,1.0000,"Since expression of both interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2-receptor-alpha (IL-2R-alpha) by lymphocytes is inhibited by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro, we hypothesized that HIV-co-infection among persons with tuberculosis (TB) might impair T-lymphocyte responses to TB via this mechanism. We measured soluble IL-2R-alpha (sIL-2R-alpha), a surrogate marker of T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation, and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor I (sTNF-RI) in sera from West African patients categorized into 4 groups: those with TB alone (TB+ HIV-, n = 55), CD4-matched groups with TB and HIV co-infection (TB+ HIV+, n = 50) or HIV infection alone (TB- HIV+, n = 35), and patients with neither disease (TB- HIV-, n = 35). The median level of sIL-2R-alpha was markedly greater in the TB+ HIV- group (1580 U/mL) compared to the TB- HIV- (670 U/mL; P < 0.001) and TB- HIV+ (880 U/mL; P < 0.01) groups. More importantly, the median concentration of sIL-2R-alpha was much lower in the TB+ HIV+ group (855 U/mL) compared to the TB+ HIV- group (1580 U/mL; P < 0.01) despite similar levels of sTNF-RI. These results suggest that T-lymphocyte activation in TB patients is impaired by HIV co-infection and, furthermore, this suppressive effect was independent of numerical depletion of CD4 lymphocytes. Impairment to IL-2-signalling might contribute to the profound impact that HIV has had on both the incidence and the clinicopathological manifestations of TB."
3,0.005,1.0000,"The inflammatory response mediated by the immune system is the major cause of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated liver injury. Here, we identified CD59, as a novel HBc-interacting protein in hepatocytes by tandem affinity purification (TAP) screening. The expression of CD59 was markedly down-regulated in HBc-transfected HepG2 or HepG2.215 cells, which resulted in an upshift of hepatocyte sensitivity to membrane attack complex (MAC)-induced cell lysis. These results were consistent with the accumulation of MACs in the liver of HBV-infected patients. Additional analyses using laser confocal microscopy, quantitative PCR and flow cytometry revealed that CD59 was specifically translocated to the nucleus upon binding to HBc, which induced the down-regulation of CD59 on both the mRNA and protein levels.

8590,0.005,1.0000,"This study examined the prevalence and characteristics of attempted suicide among a representative sample of French Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. In 2003, a face-to-face survey was conducted among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) selected in a random, stratified sample of French hospital departments. Among solicited individuals, 2,932 agreed to participate and were asked if they had ever AS. Among the respondents, 23% had AS. Female gender, younger age, native French citizenship, reporting household financial difficulties, having been HIV-contaminated through homosexual contact or through injection drug use and suffering from lipodystrophy-related symptoms were all independently associated with AS. HIV-discrimination and the lack of social support from family remained independently associated with AS. Our findings indicate a high level of AS among PLWHA and emphasize the multiple roles of factors associated with living with HIV, together with sociodemographic factors. The results enable the possibility for vulnerable groups to be targeted for specific future interventions in order to prevent attempted suicide."
613,0.005,1.0000,"To identify the principal neutralization determinant (PND) of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), antisera were generated using recombinant gp110 [the SIV analog of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) external envelope glycoprotein, gp120], gp140, several large recombinant and proteolytic envelope fragments, and synthetic peptides of the SIVmac251 isolate. When purified under conditions that retain its native structure, gp110 bound CD4 and elicited antisera that neutralized SIVmac251 with high titer. Native gp110 also completely inhibited neutralizing antibody in sera from SIVmac251-infected macaques. In contrast, denatured gp110 and gp140, large envelope fragments, and synthetic peptides (including peptides analogous to the HIV-1 PND) elicited very low or undetectable neutralizing antibody titers and did not inhibit neutralizing antibody in infected macaque sera. Enzymatically deglycosylated gp110 efficiently absorbed neutralizing antibodies from macaque sera, showing that neutralizing antibodies primarily bind the protein backbone. A 45-kDa protease digest product, mapping to the carboxyl-terminal third of gp110, also completely absorbed neutralizing antibodies from infected macaque sera. These results show that the PND(s) of this SIV isolate depends on the native conformation and that linear peptides corresponding to the V3 loop of SIV envelope, in contrast to that of HIV-1, do not elicit neutralizing antibody. This may affect the usefulness of SIVmac for evaluating HIV-1 envelope vaccine approaches that rely on eliciting neutralizing antibody."
9584,0.005,1.0000,"The immune response to viral glycoproteins is often directed against conformation- and/or glycosylation-dependent structures; synthetic peptides and bacterially expressed proteins are inadequate probes for the mapping of such epitopes. This report describes a retroviral vector system that presents such native epitopes on chimeric glycoproteins in which protein fragments of interest are fused to the C terminus of the N-terminal domain of the murine leukemia virus surface protein, gp70. The system was used to express two disulfide-bonded domains from gp120, the surface protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), that include potent neutralization epitopes. The resulting fusion glycoproteins were synthesized at high levels and were efficiently transported and secreted. A fusion protein containing the HXB2 V1/V2 domain was recognized by an HIVIIIB-infected patient serum as well as by 17 of 36 HIV-1 seropositive hemophiliac, homosexual male and intravenous drug user patient sera. Many of these HIV+ human sera reacted with V1/V2 domains from several HIV-1 clones expressed in fusion glycoproteins, indicating the presence of cross-reactive antibodies against epitopes in the V1/V2 domain. Recognition of gp(1-263):V1/V2HXB2 by the HIVIIIB-infected human patient serum was largely blocked by synthetic peptides matching V1 but not V2 sequences, while recognition of this construct by a broadly cross-reactive hemophiliac patient serum was not blocked by individual V1 or V2 peptides or by mixtures of these peptides. A construct containing the V3 domain of the IIIB strain of HIV-1, gp(1-263):V3HXB2, was recognized by sera from a human and a chimpanzee that had been infected by HIVIIIB but not by sera from hemophiliac patients who had been infected with HIV-1 of MN-like V3 serotype. The reactive sera had significantly higher titers when assayed against gp(1-263):V3HXB2 than when assayed against matching V3 peptides. Immunoprecipitation of this fusion glycoprotein by the human serum was only partially blocked by V3 peptide, indicating that this infected individual produced antibodies against epitopes in V3 that were expressed on the fusion glycoprotein but not by synthetic peptides. These data demonstrated that the chimeric glycoproteins described here effectively present native epitopes present in the V1/V2 and V3 domains of gp120 and provide efficient methods for detection of antibodies directed against native epitopes in these regions and for characterization of such epitopes."
4007,0.005,1.0000,"The specific cellular immune response toward envelope and core proteins of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) was investigated in gibbon apes chronically infected with the HTLV-IIIB isolate. After in vitro stimulation of PBMC from infected and control animals with HIV-1 Ag, DNA synthesis, IL-2R expression and IL-2 release were assayed. Cells from infected gibbon apes demonstrated a group-specific response toward whole virus preparations from three divergent HIV-1 isolates (HTLV-IIIB, HTLV-IIIRF, HTLV-IIIMN). Consistent responses were also detected against purified HIV-1 Ag, i.e., native gp120 envelope glycoprotein, recombinant gp160 glycoprotein, a synthetic peptide (peptide 7) representing a highly conserved region of gp120, and purified native core protein p24. In addition, lymphocytes from infected gibbon apes displayed a specific, MHC-restricted, cytotoxic activity against autologous cells expressing HIV-1 envelope or gag proteins. The specific T cell reactivity toward HIV-1 proteins observed in infected gibbons contrasts with findings in HIV-1 infected humans, and may help to explain the apparent discrepancy in the natural history of the infection between the two species."
9112,0.005,1.0000,Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is a significant cause of paediatric morbidity and mortality especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. It affects the kidney by injuring the glomerular and tubular epithelial cells causing leakage of albumin in urine. Microalbuminuria is known to be an early indicator of kidney injury including HIVAN. The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence and factors associated with microalbuminuria among HIV infected children receiving care and treatment at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC).
3397,0.005,1.0000,"Highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proven remarkably effective for prolonging the life of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, while most HAART agents are safe, many have the potential to cause liver toxicity. Physicians must therefore consider the possibility of drug-induced liver injury in the management of HIV-infected patients, especially those with certain risk factors such as coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), female gender, alcohol abuse, older age, or obesity. Understanding how, when, and why drug-related liver damage occurs is key to managing these patients safely and effectively. Knowledge of HAART-related liver effects will help ensure that patients receive the most benefit with the least toxicity from any given drug regimen. As more information about the mechanisms of drug related liver injury is known, clinicians will be better able to tailor therapies to suit individual situations, resulting in greater patient safety and outcomes."

In addition, the results of HIV-1 DNA PCR on DBS and the HIV-1 RNA PCR from plasma of 70 paired samples were compared. A 100% specificity and a 95% sensitivity for HIV-1 DNA PCR on DBS compared with results for venous blood were observed for the 94 paired samples. The results of the DBS HIV-1 DNA PCR and HIV-1 RNA PCR of 70 corresponding plasma samples correlated perfectly (100%). The DBS HIV-1 DNA PCR method proved reliable for HIV-1 detection."

2324,0.005,1.0000,"To study the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performance in detecting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, we tested 53 HIV-1 seropositive patients and 29 HIV-1 seronegative subjects for four different HIV-1 DNA regions. Fifty-one seropositive patients were found positive by PCR with at least one primer pair, but two were repeatedly negative for all primers. Weekly blood samples from 12 seropositive subjects all detected positive for at least one primer pair, but for three patients an irregular primer detection pattern was found. One additional HIV-1 seropositive sample, found negative for HIV DNA, was also negative for the beta-globin PCR control. The 29 seronegative specimens were HIV-1 DNA negative, as was a HIV-2 seropositive patient. This study demonstrates that PCR is almost as good as serological tests for detecting HIV infections, with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 96% and that resampling the patients may improve detection performance."

Ulcer material was analyzed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) analysis. DNA from herpes simplex virus (HSV), Haemophilus ducreyi, and Treponema pallidum was detected in 158 (52.0%), 72 (23.7%), and 31 (10.2%) of 304 ulcer specimens. Of the 304 subjects, 67 (22%) were HIV-seropositive and 64 (21%) were T. pallidum-seroreactive. Granuloma inguinale was clinically diagnosed in nine (13.4%) of 67 ulcers negative by M-PCR analysis and in 12 (5.1%) of 237 ulcers positive by M-PCR analysis (P = .03). Lymphogranuloma venereum was clinically diagnosed in eight patients. Compared with M-PCR analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of a clinical diagnosis of syphilis, herpes, and chancroid were 67.7%, 53.8%, and 75% and 91.2%, 83.6%, and 75.4%, respectively. Reactive syphilis serology was 74% sensitive and 85% specific compared with M-PCR analysis. Reported contact with a prostitute in the preceding 3 months was associated with chancroid (P = .009), reactive syphilis serology (P = .011), and HIV infection (P = .007). The relatively poor accuracy of clinical and locally available laboratory diagnoses pleads for syndromic management of genital ulcers in Jamaica. Prevention efforts should be intensified."
5278,0.005,1.0000,"We compared the line probe assay (LiPA) to sequence analysis for the detection of mutations conferring resistance to nucleoside inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT). Plasma samples from 40 patients who had received zidovudine, dideoxyinosine, and dideoxycytosine, alone or in combination, and who were enrolled in the ALTIS 2 clinical trial (lamivudine [3TC] plus stavudine) were tested at enrollment and at week 24. RT PCR products from plasma were used for LiPA, and DNA was used for sequence analysis. LiPA gave uninterpretable results for 8.5% of the analyzed codons corresponding to 63 samples, mainly for codons 41, 69, and 70. Several minor discrepancies between the two methods occurred, mainly due to the ability of LiPA to detect mixed populations while sequence analyses detect a single homogeneous population. LiPA is suitable for detecting mixed populations and easy to implement in clinical laboratories and might be useful for epidemiological surveys of primary HIV-1 resistance."

The stool samples were processed by water-ether sedimentation method; they were stained with Uvitex-2B technique for microscopic detection of intestinal microsporidium. A portion of all samples were preserved in 200microl PBS containing 2% PVPP ((Polyvinylpolypyrolidone) for confirmation with PCR. 18/105(17.2%) of the cases were positive for intestinal microsporidial infection by at least one method. 8/105 (7.6%) positive both by microscopy and PCR and 10/105 (9.5%) were positive only by PCR. All microsporidia positive cases were also HIV positive. Based on PCR analysis, 15 Enterocytozoon bieneusi and 3 Encephalitozoon intestinalis were identified. This study has shown that intestinal microsporidiosis is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in advanced AIDS patients and this is mainly attributed to Enterocytozoon bieneusi. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of intestinal microsporidiosis in Ethiopia. It has an important implication for the understanding of the aetiology of diarrhoea in HIV/AIDS patients in the country."
6204,0.005,1.0000,"Several studies had previously demonstrated the high sensitivity and specificity of JCV DNA detection in CSF by PCR. This paper reported the implementation of a simple PCR procedure to detect JCV in the CSF in a cohort of HIV-1 infected patients from Argentina. Years ago, the confirmatory diagnosis of this disease was made by in-situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry techniques on brain biopsies. The PCR procedure described here improves the diagnosis of PML because it is simple and noninvasive, and allows the differential diagnosis of PML from other neurological syndromes associated with AIDS. Many recent studies report a significant benefit of combined antiretroviral therapy on the survival of HIV patients without clear neurological improvements. A negative correlation has been described between the concentration of JCV in the CSF and survival time in HIV-1 infected patients, and the level of immune depression may influence JCV replication. This suggests that a single CSF JCV viral load determination during the course of PML disease progression may be of prognostic value for managing HIV patients."
2776,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of a PCR-based qualitative test for the rapid diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare complex (MAC) bacteremia in patients with AIDS disease. Eleven subjects with newly culture-proven MAC bacteremia had the following tests performed at biweekly intervals during the first 8 weeks of therapy: blood culture, Mycobacterium-specific PCR, and quantitative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral-load testing. Mycobacterium genus-specific biotinylated primers were used to amplify a sequence of approximately 582 nucleotides within the 16S rRNA genes of M. avium and M. intracellulare. Detection of the amplified product was performed with an oligonucleotide probe-coated microwell plate combined with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase-tetramethylbenzidine conjugate-substrate system. While not as sensitive as BACTEC culture, PCR detected 17 of 18 specimens which grew >/=40 organisms/ml (94.4% sensitivity) and 9 of 16 specimens which grew </=40 organisms/ml (56.3% sensitivity). No clear change in HIV viremia occurred in response to successful treatment of patients' MAC bacteremia. Use of the PCR test allowed detection of MAC bacteremia in 1 day, with a sensitivity similar to those of quantitative blood culture techniques, and it may prove useful for rapid screening of suspected cases. HIV viremia was unaffected by 8 weeks of MAC therapy."
1647,0.005,1.0000,"In this study, we sought to characterize the T lymphocyte recovery in vertically HIV-1-infected children who respond to long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A 3-year longitudinal retrospective study was used to perform a cross-sectional study of 32 children rated according to the time course of CD4(+) T cell percentages in response to antiretroviral therapy and CDC clinical classification: (1) long-term asymptomatic (LTA group): 8 children in A1 during the whole follow-up period; (2) responsive to HAART (Rec group): 13 children in C3 before HAART who achieved CD4(+) T cell counts of > 500 cells/mm(3) after 3 years of HAART; and (3) nonresponsive to HAART (Non-Rec group): 11 children in C3 during the whole follow-up period despite 3 years of HAART. We also studied 17 healthy age-matched uninfected children as controls. Lymphoproliferative responses (LPRs) were evaluated by incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine, identification of T cell subsets by three-color flow cytometry, and determination of thymic production of T cells by quantification of T cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECs). Interestingly, the Rec group showed an increase in percentage of CD4(+) T cells and a decrease in viral load, and recovered LPRs to mitogens and recall antigens, with values similar to those of the LTA group. Moreover, the Rec group produced similar percentages and absolute counts of naive (CD45RA(+)CD62L(+)) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and TRECs similar to those of the LTA group. In particular, the Rec group produced similar percentages of CD8(+)CD28(-)CD57(+) and CD8(+)CD28(-)CD57(-) T cell subsets compared with controls. Our data indicate that among children who have already progressed to AIDS and severe immunodeficiency but who respond to HAART, the immune system can recover and resemble those of nonprogressors or even uninfected children, in quantitative as well as in functional terms."

Results showed varied percentages of HIV-1-infected PBMC, ranging from 0.6 to 20%. Patients with more than 500 CD4+ T cells per microliter showed the lowest percentage of HIV-1-infected PBMC (2.1 +/- 1.7), compared with patients with CD4+ T-cell counts of between 200 and 499 per microliter (6.5% +/- 4.1%; P < 0.001) and patients with fewer than 200 CD4+ T cells per microliter (4.9% +/- 4.7%; P < 0.05). The difference in the percentage of HIV-1-infected PBMC between group 2 and group 3 patients may in part reflect the loss of CD4+ T lymphocytes in more advanced stages of the disease. However, the results clearly indicate a striking coincidence between the fall of the CD4+ T-cell count below 400/microliter and the sharp increase in PBMC virus loading and p24 antigenemia. Since the procedure is relatively easy to perform, it could be used to monitor the evolution of HIV-1 infection and may prove a useful adjunct in tailoring therapeutic strategies."
9020,0.005,1.0000,"There is an increase in the cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity in individuals infected with HIV that may be due to inflammatory lipid modulation not captured by traditional lipid measures. The objective of this study was to perform advanced lipoprotein phenotyping inclusive of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol efflux capacity and lipoprotein particle concentration and size in a well-phenotyped group of 118 patients infected with HIV. We used simple and multivariable analyses to determine the associations between advanced lipoprotein parameters and known cardiometabolic risk factors. Participants were on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) and had benign traditional lipid panels [median total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides of 178 mg/dl, 108 mg/dl, 44 mg/dl, and 122.5 mg/dl, respectively]. However, advanced lipoprotein phenotyping demonstrated an elevation of LDL particle number (median of 1,233 nmol/liter) and a decrease in LDL size (median of 20.4 nm), along with a decrease in protective, large HDL particles (median of 3.15 μmol/liter) and reduced HDL cholesterol efflux capacity in comparison to controls of other studies. HDL cholesterol efflux capacity was associated with HDL levels (β=0.395, p<0.001), small LDL particle concentration (β=-0.198, p=0.031), insulin sensitivity by the Matsuda index (β=0.218, p=0.029), and the Framingham Risk Score (β=-0.184, p=0.046). We demonstrate an atherogenic lipoprotein profile by NMR spectroscopy and HDL efflux measurement in a group of HIV-infected patients on stable ART with normal lipid panels."
6383,0.005,1.0000,"A pilot study was carried out in a group of six HIV-infected non-adherent men testing the effects of a behavioural medication management intervention on adherence with antiretroviral drugs. The study was prospective, using a one-group repeated-measures design. Adherence was measured using two self-reports. The intervention was a behaviourally-based programme that lasted for three months and included individualized education about antiretroviral medication and their side effects; positive reinforcement and encouragement; individualized counselling weekly; follow-up calls; and lifestyle assessment and the identification of adherence barriers. Assessments were carried out at recruitment, immediately after the initiation of the intervention, one month, three months and six months later. Results suggested that the intervention enhanced adherence rates from a mean percentage of 80.27 at baseline to a mean of 97.5% at the end of follow-up (six months time point). Similar improvement was observed in the scores of the scale measuring adherence difficulties. Further, CD4+ counts also slightly improved. Interviews with four of the participants at the end of the study highlighted the problems experienced by patients in taking their medication and supported the usefulness of the intervention. Because of the complexity of the factors behind adherence, it is important that patients are supported with individualized medication management programmes."
3489,0.005,1.0000,"To compare frequent measurement with infrequent measurement of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA levels in the management of antiretroviral therapy, we conducted a clinical strategy study of 206 HIV-infected patients who had <500 CD4 cells/mm(3). Patients were randomized (1.5:1) to undergo frequent monitoring (at baseline and every 2 months) or infrequent monitoring (at baseline and twice yearly), with CD4 cell counts determined every 2 months. Patients received unrestricted antiretroviral therapy. In the primary analysis (at month 6), the frequent group had a mean HIV RNA reduction (+/- standard deviation) of 0.93+/-0.79 log(10) copies/mL, versus 0.48+/-0.83 log(10) copies/mL for the infrequent group (P=.0002). A trend (P=.1) toward improved survival was seen in the frequent group. Given this improved virological response, more frequent HIV RNA measurement than is recommended in published guidelines (every 3-4 months) may be appropriate."
4173,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 group O infections remains essentially restricted to central Africa, and particularly Cameroon, although isolated cases have been reported in Western countries. Genomic differences explain why commercial tests used to quantify HIV-1 group M plasma load are unsuitable for HIV-1 group O. This lack of a quantitative tool hinders the clinical management of HIV-O-infected patients. We have therefore developed a real-time PCR assay, based on LightCycler technology, to quantify HIV-1 group O RNA in plasma. The primers were selected in the LTR 3' region. Forty-eight plasma samples containing strains belonging to the different HIV-1 type O clades (O:A, O:B and O:C) were tested. RNA was quantifiable in 40 of these samples. RNA was always detected in samples from untreated patients, except for one patient infected by a highly divergent strain. The kinetics of plasma viral load were also examined in seven patients for whom clinical and immunologic follow-up data were available. HIV-1 group O plasma load was high in the absence of treatment and correlated negatively with the CD4 cell count. Serial samples obtained during treatment allowed us to compare viral load changes with immunologic outcome. Despite the high initial cost of acquiring the required cycling device, the per-sample cost of this real-time quantitative PCR assay for HIV-1 group O is low, making it suitable for use in endemic zones."
3094,0.005,1.0000,"This study prospectively evaluated the effect of treatment of major depression on psychosocial functioning (health-related quality of life (HRQoL)). Previously, we reported on a trial of 75 HIV+ patients who were blindly randomized to receive treatment with drug or placebo (N=25 to each of paroxetine, imipramine, or placebo). Forty-one individuals completed the entire trial (placebo = 14, antidepressant = 27). In this study, we assessed HRQoL using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ) and the Social Adjustment Scale (SAS) at baseline and the end of the trial (12 weeks) using a random effects model to estimate treatment effects. HIV/AIDS patients with a major depressive disorder who completed the clinical trial demonstrated a reduction in depression with response to treatment and a significant improvement in HRQoL with the exception of work and financial functioning. Effective management of depression in HIV/AIDS patients is important, especially with the importance of adherence in current HIV/AIDS antiviral therapy. HRQoL improved in patients regardless of drug or response group and as a function of being in this trial suggesting that medications may not be required to affect HRQoL outcomes and that disease management aspects of care are important."
4158,0.005,1.0000,"Previous studies have implicated CXCL12 in the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection. Proteolysis of CXCL12 generates a neurotoxic molecule, CXCL12(5-67), which engages and activates CXCR3, in addition to exhibiting increased expression in the brains of patients with HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Herein, we investigated CXCR3-mediated neuronal injury, particularly, its contribution to autophagy suppression and the concomitant effects of antiretroviral therapy using human brain samples and models of HIV neuropathogenesis. Neurons in the brains of HAD patients and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected animals, as well as cultured human neurons, expressed CXCR3, which was modulated in a ligand-specific manner. Exposure of human neurons to CXCL12(5-67) caused a reduction in the autophagy-associated molecule LC3 (P<0.05) and neuronal survival (P<0.05), which recapitulated findings in FIV- and HIV-infected brains (P<0.05). Oral didanosine (ddI) treatment of FIV-infected animals reduced neurobehavioral abnormalities in conjunction with diminished plasma viral load (P<0.05). F4/80 transcript abundance and CXCL12(5-67) immunoreactivity were reduced with restored neuronal LC3 expression in the brains of FIV-infected animals after ddI treatment (P<0.05). ddI treatment also prevented microglial activation and depletion of synaptic proteins in the cortex of FIV-infected animals (P<0.05). These findings indicate that the beneficial effects of ddI might be a consequence of a reduced systemic viral burden and concurrent leukocyte activation, leading to diminished neuroinflammation with preservation of neuronal autophagy by regulating CXCR3 activation."
6966,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) expresses two structural forms of the nucleoprotein, the intracellular nucleocapsid (hepatitis core antigen [HBcAg]) and the secreted nonparticulate form (hepatitis e antigen [HBeAg]). The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of HBcAg- and HBeAg-specific genetic immunogens to induce HBc/HBeAg-specific CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell immune responses and the potential to induce liver injury in HBV-transgenic (Tg) mice. Both the HBcAg- and HBeAg-specific plasmids primed comparable immune responses. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were important for priming/effector functions of HBc/HBeAg-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. However, a unique two-step immunization protocol was necessary to elicit maximal CTL priming. Genetic vaccination did not prime CTLs in HBe- or HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice but elicited a weak CTL response in HBcAg-Tg mice. When HBc/HBeAg-specific CTLs were adoptively transferred into HBc-, HBe-, and HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice, the durations of the liver injury and inflammation were significantly greater in HBeAg-Tg recipient mice than in HBcAg-Tg mice. Importantly, liver injury in HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice was similar to the injury observed in HBeAg-Tg mice. Loss of HBeAg synthesis commonly occurs during chronic HBV infection; however, the mechanism of selection of HBeAg-negative variants is unknown. The finding that hepatocytes expressing wild-type HBV (containing both HBcAg and HBeAg) are more susceptible to CTL-mediated clearance than hepatocytes expressing only HBcAg suggest that the HBeAg-negative variant may have a selective advantage over wild-type HBV within the livers of patients with chronic infection during an immune response and may represent a CTL escape mutant."
6319,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatocellular injury in hepatitis B virus infection may be produced by an autoaggressive hepatocytotoxic immune response. To test the hypothesis that acquired suppressor cell defects may participate in such a response, we assessed the functional integrity of 2 suppressor cell populations in patients with type B viral hepatitis. Spontaneous suppression of the 1-way mixed lymphocyte response by radiation-resistant, adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells decreases during the acute phase of disease, returns towards normal with clinical recovery, but remains depressed in patients with chronic hepatitis. The degree of spontaneous suppressor cell dysfunction correlates inversely with at least 1 biochemical parameter of hepatocellular injury (SGPT). The functional integrity of this suppressor cell fluctuates during chronic hepatitis and may reflect currently undefined biologic variables in this disease. Mitogen-induced suppression on lymphocyte activation by radiation resistant, nonadherent suppressor cells is also depressed in acute and chronic hepatitis, but it does not correlate with biochemical evidence of hepatocellular injury on an individual-patient basis. Documentation of these generalized defects of nonspecific suppressor cell function establishes a basis for the possible existence of specific anomalies of immuno-regulation that may permit the expression of normally suppressed auoaggressive hepatocytotoxic immune mechanisms in viral hepatitis."
3610,0.005,1.0000,"Recent findings suggest bidirectional antagonisms between the K65R mutation and thymidine analogue mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected, treatment-experienced patients, yet little is known about HIV-2 in this regard. This study addressed the effects of innate polymorphisms in HIV-2 on emergent resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. Emergent drug resistance profiles in HIV-2 subtypes A (n = 3) and B (n = 1) were compared to those of HIV-1 subtypes B and C. Drug resistance was evaluated with cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and MT2 cells, using selective pressure with tenofovir (TFV), zidovudine (ZDV), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), abacavir (ABC), lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine (FTC), or various dual-drug combinations. Resistance was evaluated using conventional and ultrasensitive sequencing approaches. In agreement with our previous findings, dual-drug combinations of TFV, ddI, ABC, d4T, ZDV, and 3TC preferentially selected for K65R in HIV-1 subtype C isolates. In HIV-1 subtype B, TFV-3TC and ZDV-3TC selected for M184I and D67N, respectively. In contrast, selections with all four HIV-2 cultures favored the development of M184I in dual-drug combinations that included either 3TC or FTC. Since HIV-2 cultures did not develop K65R, an ultrasensitive allele-specific real-time PCR assay was developed to distinguish the presence of 65R from wild-type K65 after 16 cycles with a discriminatory ability of 0.1% against a population of wild-type virus. These results underscore potential differences in emergent drug resistance pathways in HIV-1 and HIV-2 and show that polymorphisms may influence the development of the resistance pathways that are likely to emerge."
9229,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) has greatly reduced the incidence of dementia. The goal of this longitudinal study was to determine if there are ongoing macrostructural brain changes in human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV + ) individuals treated with ART. To quantify brain structure, three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed at baseline and again after 24 months in 39 HIV+ patients on ART and 30 HIV- controls. Longitudinal changes in brain volume were measured using tissue segmentation within regions of interest and deformation morphometry. Measured by tissue segmentation, HIV+ patients on ART had significantly (all P<.05) greater rates of white matter volume loss than HIV- control individuals. Compared with controls, the subgroup of HIV+ individuals on ART with viral suppression also had significantly greater rates of white matter volume loss. Deformation morphometry confirmed these results with more specific spatial localization. Deformation morphometry also detected greater rates of gray matter and white matter loss in the subgroup of HIV+ individuals with detectable viral loads. These results provide evidence of ongoing brain volume loss in HIV+ individuals on stable ART, possibly suggesting ongoing cerebral injury. The presence of continuing injury raises the possibility that HIV+ individuals-even in the presence of viral suppression in the periphery-are at greater risk for future cognitive impairments and dementia and possibly faster cognitive decline. Therefore, HIV+ individuals on ART should be monitored for cognitive decline, and treatments that reduce ongoing neurological injury should be considered."
5217,0.005,1.0000,"Denmark is a country with low prevalence and incidence of blood borne viral infections. Among health care workers (HCWs) vaccination for hepatitis B is only offered to high-risk groups. The aims of this cross sectional survey were to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B, -C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among the staff at a Danish University hospital and to correlate this with risk factors for transmission. Additionally, we wanted to examine the current frequency of blood exposure, reporting habits and hepatitis B vaccination status in the staff. Of 1439 eligible hospital staffs included, 960 (67%) were HCWs. The overall human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-, hepatitis C Virus (HCV)- and hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-prevalence was 0% (0/1439), 0.14% (2/1439) and 1.6% (23/1439), respectively. Twenty-three percent of HCWs were vaccinated against HBV. Age, blood transfusion and stay in endemic areas were associated independently to HBV infection as opposed to job-category, duration of employment, HBV vaccination status and blood exposure. Based on a 4-week recall period, the incidence of percutaneous blood exposure was 1.5/person-year. In conclusion the HIV and hepatitis prevalence was low despite frequent blood exposure and the principal risk factors were unrelated to work. Danish HCWs do not seem to be at increased risk of hepatitis B even though universal HBV vaccination has not been implemented."
365,0.005,1.0000,"Previous studies of risk factors for hepatitis B virus infection among hospital employees have been based on surveys in single institutions or have been analyzed with univariate techniques. From November 1980 through August 1981, the authors performed a multi-institutional seroepidemiologic survey of hospital employees screened for entrance into a hepatitis B vaccine trial who represented groups at high risk for hepatitis B infection. Using a logistic regression model for the analysis of risk factors, the investigators determined the relative odds and 95% confidence intervals for risk of hepatitis B infection to be as follows: race (nonwhite/white: 3.4; 2.4-4.8) (p less than 0.001); history of acute viral hepatitis of an unspecified type (3.6; 2.2-5.9) (p less than 0.001); and employment at hospitals 1 through 5 as compared with hospital 6 (1.8; 1.1-2.9) (p = 0.015). In addition, certain job categories and the duration of employment within some of these categories were associated with increasing risk for hepatitis B infection over time. Laboratory workers (1.4; 1.2-1.7), surgical staff (1.2; 1.1-1.4), and medical staff (1.3; 1.1-1.5) had significant (p less than 0.05) increased risk of prior infection with longer duration of employment. Such time-job interaction was not demonstrable for nursing staff, anesthesiology staff, dental personnel, pathology staff, or ancillary personnel. The logistic regression model also shows that the highest gradient of risk for laboratory workers, surgeons, and medical staff occurs during the first five years of employment. An effective preventive strategy, such as the use of hepatitis B vaccine, should be targeted for these groups at the time of initial employment."
4237,0.005,1.0000,"Health care professionals working with individuals with chronic medical illness, especially those infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), may be at risk for burnout and departure due to various job stresses such as the death of patients and social stigma. Factors that prevent burnout and employee attrition are seldom studied. Two hundred thirteen staff (doctors, nurses and mental health workers) at a representative sample of Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTC) completed instruments to measure Burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory), and perceived job stresses and satisfaction (job tasks, interactions with colleagues and patient care). The staff were surveyed again after two years and their job status determined after 4 years. After 4 years, 35% of the staff had left the field of Hemophilia/HIV care. Univariate tests found that retention was significantly associated with initial job satisfaction, being married and low levels of stress with colleagues. Burnout, as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory, at baseline, was unrelated to job retention over 4 years. An adjusted multiple logistic regression of all significant variables found that colleague support was most related to retention (OR=2.8, CI=1.49,5.1). We conclude that attrition of highly trained staff is a significant issue for patients and HTCs. These data suggest the important role that a well-functioning team can have in buffering the inevitable stresses associated with HIV care. Mental Health professionals have considerable expertise in addressing these issues."
8625,0.005,1.0000,"The purposes of this study were 1) to compare blood donor deferrals resulting from additional, oral questions about human immunodeficiency virus risk behaviors with deferrals resulting from currently used, written screening questions; 2) to examine differences in donor deferral resulting from use of an indirect (IQ) versus direct (DQ) additional oral question format; and 3) to evaluate written survey responses of donors and staff members to the additional questions. The IQ group (n = 3050) were asked if they understood the seven ineligible-donor risk behaviors, and the DQ group (n = 4753) were asked if they had engaged in any of these behaviors. Owing to positive answers or refusal to answer the additional questions, there was an increase in donor deferrals, over the level seen with customary screening. Only 1 percent of donors indicated they would not return if the questions were asked in the future. Embarrassment was indicated by 3 percent of the IQ group and 7 percent of the DQ group; 14 to 15 percent preferred to write their answers rather than give them orally. The staff members generally felt training was adequate (IQ = 92%, DQ = 83%) and were comfortable asking the questions (IQ = 82%, DQ = 78%). Mean screening times were 5.7 minutes before the addition of the oral questions, 7.5 minutes with IQ, and 7.6 minutes with DQ. This study confirms the value of IQ and DQ formats in identifying potentially infectious donors and suggests that the DQ format may be slightly more effective."

Among blood-borne pathogens, HBV can stay alive on environmental surfaces for over a week. The incidence of HBV was extremely high among HD patients. HBV vaccination, screening of blood products and infection control measures lead to significant decrease of HBV among HD patients. The infection control measures include; Medication safety and injection practices, environmental cleaning and disinfection, reuse of dialyzers for same patients, hand hygiene, isolation and barrier precautions, HBV vaccination and routine serology checking, assuring HBV immune status for HD unit staff, transmission based precautions and outbreak management.

5178,0.005,1.0000,"Many persons infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are unknown to the healthcare system because they may be asymptomatic for years, have not been tested for HCV infection, and only seek medical care when they develop liver-related complications. We analyzed data from persons who tested positive for past or current HCV infection during participation in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2001 through 2008. A follow-up survey was conducted 6 months after examination to determine (1) how many participants testing positive for HCV infection were aware of their HCV status before being notified by NHANES, (2) what actions participants took after becoming aware of their first positive test, and (3) participants' knowledge about hepatitis C. Of 30,140 participants tested, 393 (1.3%) had evidence of past or current HCV infection and 170 (43%) could be contacted during the follow-up survey and interviewed. Only 49.7% were aware of their positive HCV infection status before being notified by NHANES, and only 3.7% of these respondents reported that they had first been tested for HCV because they or their doctor thought they were at risk for infection. Overall, 85.4% had heard of hepatitis C; correct responses to questions about hepatitis C were higher among persons 40-59 years of age, white non-Hispanics, and respondents who saw a physician after their first positive HCV test. Eighty percent of respondents indicated they had seen a doctor about their first positive HCV test result."
2445,0.005,1.0000,"The production of alpha- and gamma-interferon (IFN) by peripheral blood cells in vitro and the concentration of serum IFN were studied in patients treated by hemodialysis at the Pelgulinna Tallinn Hospital and compared to controls. Out of 108 patients on hemodialysis, 19.4% were infected with hepatitis B (HBV), and antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV) were detected in 7.4%. During 3.5 years of observation, cases of hepatitis B and C infection among patients and medical staff were rare. The production of alpha- and gamma-IFN in 23 patients with HBV and/or HCV markers on hemodialysis and in 38 patients without markers was similarly decreased in comparison with the controls and the titers of serum IFN were similarly increased. Lack of reliable difference between IFN status of two groups of patients may be explained by the absence of clinical symptoms of hepatitis, confirmed by laboratory findings."
2459,0.005,1.0000,"To evaluate the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure among emergency department workers (EDWs) and their ability to identify HIV-infected patients, a seroprevalence study was performed in March 1991 in the emergency departments (EDs) of six Italian urban hospitals. At each visit, patients aged 18-65 years were asked to undergo fingerstick blood sampling for anonymous, unlinked HIV testing performed on blood adsorbed filter paper collection cards. Demographic characteristics, known or suspected HIV risk factors, and occupational exposures reported by the EDWs during the patient's visit were recorded. On 9,457 consecutive visits, 9,005 samples (95%) were tested and 65 (0.7%) were HIV positive. ED staff failed to identify 59% of HIV-infected patients. The rate of occupational exposures was 0.13/100 visits. As it is impossible to predict the HIV status of patients attending EDs, adherence to universal precautions and the development of safer devices should be utilized to minimize the risk of blood-borne infections in EDWs."
7577,0.005,1.0000,"Adenoviral vectors encoding hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural (NS) proteins induce multispecific, high-magnitude, durable CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses in healthy volunteers. We assessed the capacity of these vaccines to induce functional HCV-specific immune responses and determine T-cell cross-reactivity to endogenous virus in patients with chronic HCV infection. HCV genotype 1-infected patients were vaccinated using heterologous adenoviral vectors (ChAd3-NSmut and Ad6-NSmut) encoding HCV NS proteins in a dose escalation, prime-boost regimen, with and without concomitant pegylated interferon-α/ribavirin therapy. Analysis of immune responses ex vivo used human leukocyte antigen class I pentamers, intracellular cytokine staining, and fine mapping in interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assays. Cross-reactivity of T cells with population and endogenous viral variants was determined following viral sequence analysis. Compared to healthy volunteers, the magnitude of HCV-specific T-cell responses following vaccination was markedly reduced. CD8(+) HCV-specific T-cell responses were detected in 15/24 patients at the highest dose, whereas CD4(+) T-cell responses were rarely detectable. Analysis of the host circulating viral sequence showed that T-cell responses were rarely elicited when there was sequence homology between vaccine immunogen and endogenous virus. In contrast, T cells were induced in the context of genetic mismatch between vaccine immunogen and endogenous virus; however, these commonly failed to recognize circulating epitope variants and had a distinct partially functional phenotype. Vaccination was well tolerated but had no significant effect on HCV viral load."
7829,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic continues to grow at an alarming rate, with a further 5 million new infections in 2003. Some 3.5 million of these were in sub-Saharan Africa, where approximately 70% of the world's HIV-positive population resides. In contrast, the spread of HIV in high-income countries has slowed since its discovery in the 1980s, and in regions such as Western Europe prevalence has decreased. Here, we employ coalescent methods to compare the epidemic growth rates of two subtypes of HIV-1 with differing epidemiological profiles: subtype C, which is dominant in sub-Saharan Africa and associated with heterosexual transmission, and subtype B, the main cause of AIDS in Western Europe and North America, and which was primarily transmitted through homosexual sex and injecting drug use. We show that although both subtypes emerged at approximately the same time ( approximately 1960), they have widely differing patterns of exponential population growth. At its current growth rate the epidemic of subtype C in sub-Saharan Africa is doubling every 2.4 years, which is approximately half the rate observed during the early stages of the subtype B epidemic in Western Europe and North America. However, the subtype C growth rate is still 5-10 times greater than that estimated for the blood-borne hepatitis C virus, supporting the hypothesis that sexual transmission has been primarily responsible for the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa."

We looked for XMRV in 230 patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or hepatitis C infection. XMRV was undetectable in plasma or peripheral blood mononuclear cells by polymerase chain reaction targeting XMRV gag or env. T cell responses to XMRV Gag were undetectable in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by ex vivo gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot assay.

4804,0.005,1.0000,"CCR5 antagonists are a powerful new class of antiretroviral drugs that require a companion assay to evaluate the presence of CXCR4-tropic (non-R5) viruses prior to use in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. In this study, we have developed, characterized, verified, and prevalidated a novel phenotypic test to determine HIV-1 coreceptor tropism (VERITROP) based on a sensitive cell-to-cell fusion assay. A proprietary vector was constructed containing a near-full-length HIV-1 genome with the yeast uracil biosynthesis (URA3) gene replacing the HIV-1 env coding sequence. Patient-derived HIV-1 PCR products were introduced by homologous recombination using an innovative yeast-based cloning strategy. The env-expressing vectors were then used in a cell-to-cell fusion assay to determine the presence of R5 and/or non-R5 HIV-1 variants within the viral population. Results were compared with (i) the original version of Trofile (Monogram Biosciences, San Francisco, CA), (ii) population sequencing, and (iii) 454 pyrosequencing, with the genotypic data analyzed using several bioinformatics tools, i.e., the 11/24/25 rule, Geno2Pheno (2% to 5.75%, 3.5%, or 10% false-positive rate [FPR]), and webPSSM. VERITROP consistently detected minority non-R5 variants from clinical specimens, with an analytical sensitivity of 0.3%, with viral loads of ≥1,000 copies/ml, and from B and non-B subtypes. In a pilot study, a 73.7% (56/76) concordance was observed with the original Trofile assay, with 19 of the 20 discordant results corresponding to non-R5 variants detected using VERITROP and not by the original Trofile assay. The degree of concordance of VERITROP and Trofile with population and deep sequencing results depended on the algorithm used to determine HIV-1 coreceptor tropism. Overall, VERITROP showed better concordance with deep sequencing/Geno2Pheno at a 0.3% detection threshold (67%), whereas Trofile matched better with population sequencing (79%). However, 454 sequencing using Geno2Pheno at a 10% FPR and 0.3% threshold and VERITROP more accurately predicted the success of a maraviroc-based regimen. In conclusion, VERITROP may promote the development of new HIV coreceptor antagonists and aid in the treatment and management of HIV-infected individuals prior to and/or during treatment with this class of drugs."
9939,0.005,1.0000,"In the United States and Western Europe, most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections are caused by subtype B. We analyzed the nucleotide sequence of HIV-1 RNA in plasma samples from 141 children enrolled into PACTG 377, a comparative study of several antiretroviral therapy regimens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two children, both born in the United States, were infected with non-B subtypes that are most commonly found in Africa: one with subtype D and the other with circulating recombinant form CRF02, an A/G recombinant lineage. Viral load assays performed to monitor treatment response underestimated the levels of HIV-1 RNA in the child with the A/G recombinant. These cases demonstrate mother-to-child transmission of non-B subtypes of HIV-1 in the United States. Non-B subtypes should be considered in the management of HIV-1-infected pregnant women and children to optimize strategies to prevent and treat pediatric HIV-1 infection."

We systematically reviewed the published literature on prevalence of HCV infections among IDUs between January 1989 and April 2014. Sixty studies met the inclusion criteria for the review and subsequent analysis. Among the selected studies 26,311 IDUs were assessed for HCV infection of which 16,231 were positive, giving an overall prevalence of 61.7% (95% Confidence Interval [95% CI] 61.1-62.3%). Of the selected studies, 21 were from Asia, 20 from Europe, 13 from Americas, 5 from Australia and one from Africa. Combined regional estimates of HCV prevalence among IDUs showed that Africa has the highest mean prevalence of HCV among IDUs (97.3%, 95% CI 95.5-98.4%), however, this estimate was based only on one study from Mauritius. Europe has the second highest mean prevalence (65.9%, 95% CI 64.9-66.9%) followed by Australia (56.5%, 95% CI 53.8-59.2%). Our review suggests that the prevalence of HCV among IDUs is significantly high. There are very limited data from African nations. More comprehensive understanding of HCV epidemiology among IDUs including the risk behaviours are needed for this high risk group. "
9198,0.005,1.0000,"Glucophosphoisomerase (GPI), a glycolytic enzyme, was recently described to share 90% sequence homology with neuroleukin, a recently discovered growth factor which promotes motor neuron regeneration in vivo, survival of peripheral and central neurons in vitro, and affects B cell immunoglobulin synthesis. Interestingly, neuroleukin activity was described to be antagonized by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (gp120), with which neuroleukin was found to share partial sequence homology. In this study, reduced GPI demonstrated similar activity to neuroleukin in a novel bioassay using human and rat neuroblastoma cell lines. In the presence of reduced GPI, these cells were found to differentiate, in terms of enhanced neurite extension at a reduced proliferation rate. These results demonstrate the existence of a novel growth factor activity of an evolutionary ancient enzyme. The nonreduced commercial form of GPI, probably the dimer, was found to be inactive in this bioassay. Using the neuroblastoma cells model system, we further investigated the significance of the region of homology to HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp120) as the putative binding site of GPI to its receptor on neuronal cells."
7995,0.005,1.0000,"The first use of lentiviral vectors in humans involved transduction of mature T-cells with an human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived env antisense (envAS) vector to protect cells from HIV infection. In that study, only a minority of the patient T-cell population could be gene-modified, raising the question of whether the altered cells could affect replicating HIV populations. We investigated this using humanized NOD/SCID IL-2Rgamma(null) (hNSG) mice reconstituted with approximately 4-11% envAS-modified human T-cells. Mice were challenged with HIV-1(NL4-3), which has an env perfectly complementary to envAS, or with HIV-1(BaL), which has a divergent env. No differences were seen in viral titer between mice that received envAS-modified cells and control mice that did not. Using 454/Roche pyrosequencing, we analyzed the mutational spectrum in HIV populations in serum-from 33 mice we recovered 84,074 total reads comprising 31,290 unique sequence variants. We found enrichment of A-to-G transitions and deletions in envAS-treated mice, paralleling a previous tissue culture study where most target cells contained envAS, even though minority of cells were envAS-modified here. Unexpectedly, this enrichment was only detected after the challenge with HIV-1(BaL), where the viral genome would form an imperfect duplex with envAS, and not HIV-1(NL4-3), where a perfectly matched duplex would form."

We therefore wished to investigate their occurrence together, and establish the degree of cytokine activation present. From a prospective cohort of individuals with HIV-MCD, we investigated the incidence and outcomes of HPS and measured 15 inflammatory cytokines and the plasma HHV-8 viral loads before and during follow-up. Of 44 patients with HIV-MCD with an incidence of 4.3/10,000 patient years, four individuals (9%) were diagnosed with HPS. All are in remission (range 6-28 months) following splenectomy, etoposide and rituximab-based therapy. Plasma HHV-8 levels were raised markedly at presentation (median 3,840,000 copies/ml). Histological samples from spleen, splenic hilar lymph nodes and bone marrow demonstrated increased phagocytosis by histiocytes and presence of HHV-8-infected plasmablasts outside the follicles. Surprisingly, many known inflammatory plasma cytokines were not elevated, although interleukin (IL)-8 and interferon-gamma were increased in all cases and IL-6 levels were raised in three of four patients. HPS in the setting of HIV-MCD is common and treatment can be successful provided the diagnosis is made appropriately. Systemic activation of cytokines was limited, suggesting that immunosuppressive therapy with steroids is not indicated in HHV-8-driven HPS."
3995,0.005,1.0000,"Despite three decades of dramatic treatment breakthroughs in antiretroviral regimens, clinical outcomes for people living with HIV vary greatly. The HIV treatment cascade models the stages of care that people living with HIV go through toward the goal of viral suppression and demonstrates that <30% of those living with HIV/AIDS in the United States have met this goal. Although some research has focused on the ways that patient characteristics and patient-provider relationships contribute to clinical adherence and treatment success, few studies to date have examined the ways that contextual factors of care and the healthcare environment contribute to patient outcomes. Here, we present qualitative findings from a mixed-methods study to describe contextual and healthcare environment factors in a Ryan White Part C clinic that are associated with patients' abilities to achieve viral suppression. We propose a modification of Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization, and its more recent adaptation developed by Ulett et al., to describe the ways that clinic, system, and provider factors merge to create a system of care in which more than 86% of the patient population is virally suppressed."
9389,0.005,1.0000,"From 1 January 1995 through 31 June 1997, 153 cases of coccidioidomycosis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons were identified in Arizona (incidence, 41/1000 persons living with AIDS). A case-control study was conducted to evaluate risk factors for coccidioidomycosis in HIV-infected persons. A case was defined as laboratory-confirmed, incident coccidioidomycosis in a person infected with HIV for > or =3 months, and each case patient had 3 control patients matched by county, age group, sex, HIV/AIDS status, and CD4 lymphocyte count. Multivariable analysis identified black race and a history of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis to be associated with increased risk of coccidioidomycosis; protease inhibitor therapy was associated with a reduced risk. In persons with previous history of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis, having received an azole drug was associated with a reduced risk (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.9; P=.04). Physicians may need to consider azole chemoprophylaxis for HIV-infected persons who live in areas of endemicity, have CD4 cell counts <200/microL, are black, or have a history of thrush."

2541,0.005,1.0000,"Fifty-one patients were selected from 4 leprosaria in eastern Nigeria and were examined for evidence of syphilis. They were screened serologically for treponemal and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Information about their sexual behaviour and demographic data were obtained to determine the factors associated with increased risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STD). They were compared with 115 controls. The results showed that positive treponemal tests were more common in those patients living outside the leprosaria (P < 0.05). Age and sex of the patients living inside the leprosaria were not factors associated with treponemal infections. Leprosy appeared to be a factor for T. pallidum infection when compared with the control group (P < 0.05; OR 476; CI 1.16, 19.5). One leprosy patient and one control subject had positive HIV tests and there was no significant association between leprosy and HIV infection. These findings suggest the possibility of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases amongst the leprosy patient population. The importance with respect to control measures is that leprosy patients living outside leprosaria may constitute a potential reservoir for introducing sexually transmitted diseases into the leprosaria."
5186,0.005,1.0000,"The presented study examined the incidence, risk factors and outcome of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia (NBP) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects. Forty-two cases of NBP were ascertained by a 5-yr prospective surveillance and were matched to 84 controls. NBP incidence was 10.8 per 10,000 hospital patient-days. In particular, the incidence of NBP was 13.9 per 10,000 patient-days in the period 1994-1996 and 5.6 per 10,000 patient-days in the period 1997-1998 (p=0.01). By using regression analysis, predictors for developing NBP were an increasing value of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score (p<0.01) and the presence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related central nervous system (CNS) diseases (p=0.01). The additional hospital stay attributable to NBP was 15 days. The attributable mortality rate was estimated to be 29%. Nosocomial bacterial pneumonia is more common in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection, high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score and central nervous system diseases. Although the incidence of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia, as well of other opportunistic infections, decreased considerably in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, it still represents an important cause of mortality."

3110,0.005,1.0000,"Transgenic technology has been very successful at providing insights into possible processes involved in HIV-induced pathogenesis. The availability of these small animal models for the study of HIV-related syndromes including KS, epidermal proliferative lesions, HIV-associated nephropathy, AIDS-related growth failure and cachexia may well facilitate the development of novel therapies for these complications. Other phenotypes created in mice, such as cataracts and hepatic cancer [59], may not have human analogies but may still provide insight into pathogenesis. Thus, transgenic models have already provided resources to study many manifestations of AIDS and others are likely to be developed. The optimal strategy for designing future transgenic animals, however, is less clear. No transgenic mouse model has been generated to date that will provide an avenue for vaccine development. This advance awaits the further discovery of the host factors that facilitate the virus replicative cycle in humans and a better understanding of these pathways in the mouse. For the development of molecular-based therapy, however, the currently available models may well be adequate to test molecular inhibitors of transcription [7,60,61] and post-transcriptional processing of viral mRNA [62]. Whether single or multigenic constructs under the control of the LTR are better or worse for this purpose is a debatable issue. Transgenic technology may yet make an additional contribution to the development of molecular therapy for AIDS. The best method of demonstrating that a gene therapeutic strategy is safe to administer to patients has not been determined. By introducing potentially therapeutic constructs into mice as transgenes, their safety can be assessed in many different cell types in vivo, analogous to toxicological testing in rodents for systemically administered drugs. Thus, transgenic technology has already provided insights into the pathogenesis of HIV-1. While it has not yet proven its utility for vaccine development, transgenic technology holds the promise of being an active participant in the development of both safe and effective gene therapy approaches for the treatment of AIDS."
7638,0.005,1.0000,"Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) is the most common cause of focal deficits in patients living with HIV/AIDS. Among 257 HIV-infected adult patients seen between January 2006 and December 2010 in a tertiary hospital in Zaria, northern Nigeria, 9 (3.5%) patients had clinical, serological, and brain imaging evidence of TE. All 9 patients had CD4 count of less than 50 cells/mm(3). Of the 9 patients, 7 were antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive, while 2 were cases of ART-induced TE-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. After administering intravenous dexamethasone for cerebral decompression and specific antitoxoplasma therapy, symptoms and signs resolved in 8 patients within 4 to 14 days, but 1 patient died. Our data suggest that even in the ART era in Nigeria, TE remains a fairly common cause of morbidity among HIV-infected patients due to late HIV diagnosis and significant immunosuppression at diagnosis. Early HIV diagnosis, early initiation of highly active ART, and routine prophylaxis against TE are imperative in combating the challenge of HIV/AIDS-related TE in Nigeria. "

It is already the ninth leading cause of death among children 1 to 4 years of age and the seventh in young people between the ages of 15 and 24 years. If current trends continue, AIDS can be expected to move into the top five leading causes of death in the pediatric and adolescent age group in the next 3 or 4 years. To address this problem and also to provide focus for the US Department of Health and Human Services activities dealing with pediatric AIDS, an intradepartmental work group was established as a central health and human services component. This was done to ensure the best possible use of federal resources on behalf of children and adolescents with AIDS. Its recommendations are the basis of this report."
3143,0.005,1.0000,"We report three cases of thrombocytopenic purpura associated with HIV-1 infection. The clinical picture is indistinguishable from classic autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (AITP). All three patients initially responded to treatment with high dose methylprednisolone. One patient had an incomplete remission on low dose prednisone, while another responded to zidovudine treatment. The third patient underwent splenectomy because he showed no response to treatment with low dose prednisone or zidovudine. The pathogenesis of HIV-associated thrombocytopenic purpura (HIV-TP) is still controversial. Two hypotheses are frequently mentioned: non-specific deposition of circulating immune complexes and complement versus specific auto-antibodies against platelets are suggested to be the cause of the increased clearance of platelets. In cases of severe thrombocytopenia, the therapy of first choice is initial high dose methylprednisolone, followed by either low dose prednisone in the presence of a relatively unaffected cellular immunity, or zidovudine, when the cellular immunity is already severely impaired."
7039,0.005,1.0000,"Although perinatal transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is well documented, seroprevalence rates of HIV in populations of women of reproductive age have not yet been reported. To determine the seroprevalence of HIV in childbearing women from a population with a high incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cord blood samples were collected from 602 infants delivered at an inner-city municipal hospital in New York. Demographic and HIV risk factor information was also collected from mothers of these infants. Twelve (2%) of 602 samples (95% confidence interval, 1% to 4%) were positive for HIV on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. In interviews, seven of 12 seropositive women had risk factors as defined by the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta; the remaining five seropositive women had no self-identified risk factors. The HIV seroprevalence rate in our hospital (2.0%) is several times higher than that of many other diseases for which screening is already routine. This serosurvey indicates that HIV infection of inner-city parturients is a significant problem that warrants broadly implemented health strategies. Furthermore, the data also suggest that if risk factor information elicited by physicians is used to initiate HIV antibody counseling and testing of pregnant women, a significant number of seropositive parturients is missed. In areas with significant seroprevalence rates of HIV infection, a broader counseling and testing program may be needed."
4738,0.005,1.0000,"Opportunistic infections such as cryptosporidiosis and cyclosporiasis are commonly encountered in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We investigated the existence of opportunistic protozoans that significantly affect the quality of life in HIV-1 infected patients using conventional and molecular methods. The study group comprised 115 HIV-1 positive patients. In the identification of Cyclospora cayetanensis and Cryptosporidium, the formol-ether precipitation method was used and smears were evaluated in optical microscope by staining modified Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN). The primers and probes used for PCR were Heat shock protein 70 for C. cayetanensis and the oocysts wall protein for Cryptosporidium spp.. Cyclospora and Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were detected in one and two patients, respectively, by staining, whereas we detected C. cayetanensis in three patients out of 115 (2.6%) by PCR, and Cryptosporidium spp. in a further three patients (2.6%). C. cayetensis was detected in patients with CD4 counts of 64 cells/μm, 182 cells/μm and 287 cells/μm, respectively. Cryptosporidium spp. was detected in patients with CD4 counts of 176 cells/μm, 241 cells/μm and 669 cells/μm. As conclusion, PCR method is faster and more sensitive than microscopic methods and to screen intestinal pathogens routinely in patients infected with HIV should not be neglected in developing countries like Turkey."
3282,0.005,1.0000,"A new, multiple-antigen enzyme immunoassay (EIA-2) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies was evaluated in parallel with the previously available c100-3 HCV EIA (EIA-1) in 14,068 volunteer blood donors as well as in 25 cases of transfusion-associated hepatitis C for which recipient and donor samples were available. When compared to EIA-1, the EIA-2 was more sensitive in detecting HCV-infected blood donors. The EIA-2 detected an additional 1 in 1000 EIA-1-negative, surrogate marker-negative donors who were infected with HCV as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The specificity of the EIA-2 was comparable to that of the EIA-1, but the two tests appear to detect different populations of false-positive donors. Recombinant immunoblot assay-indeterminate donors were detected five times more frequently by the EIA-2; PCR demonstrated that 21 percent of these donors were infected with HCV. The greater sensitivity of EIA-2 was also found in 25 transfusion recipients with non-A, non-B hepatitis; however, in 16 percent of these cases of posttransfusion HCV infection, the EIA-2 failed to detect an HCV-seropositive donor. These data indicate that EIA-2 testing will significantly reduce, but probably not eliminate, the risk of transfusion-associated HCV infection; we estimate this residual per-unit risk to be 1 in 2000 to 1 in 6000 units transfused. On a national level, it is projected that the replacement of the anti-HCV EIA-1 with the EIA-2 will initially prevent up to 40 additional cases of transfusion-associated hepatitis C per day."
2258,0.005,1.0000,"Comparative sequence analysis of different isolates of hepatitis G virus (HGV) has demonstrated significant intersubject genetic heterogeneity, but few data on intrasubject genetic evolution have been reported. To further investigate the genetic diversification of the HGV genome, 36 plasma samples from eleven patients chronically infected with HGV serially obtained 2-4 years apart were analysed. We determined the viral nucleotide sequence of the 5' non-coding (NC) and the NS3 regions by directly sequencing the RT-PCR amplified products obtained from the viral RNAs. Intrasubject sequence variation was found to be 1.3-2.4 x 10(-3) base substitutions per genome site per year within the 5' NC region and 1.3-9.4 x 10(-3) base substitutions per genome site per year within the NS3 region. Depending on the genomic region analysed (i.e. 5' NC or NS3 region), pairwise comparisons and phylogenetic reconstructions showed that intersubject genetic distances were 17.5- to 20.8-fold greater than intrasubject ones. Overall, the evolution rate of HGV in the regions analysed is not significantly different from that found in hepatitis C virus."

A common polymorphism, SDF1-3'A, was identified in an evolutionarily conserved segment of the 3' untranslated region of the SDF-1 structural gene transcript. In the homozygous state, SDF1-3'A/3'A delays the onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), according to a genetic association analysis of 2857 patients enrolled in five AIDS cohort studies. The recessive protective effect of SDF1-3'A was increasingly pronounced in individuals infected with HIV-1 for longer periods, was twice as strong as the dominant genetic restriction of AIDS conferred by CCR5 and CCR2 chemokine receptor variants in these populations, and was complementary with these mutations in delaying the onset of AIDS."
6049,0.005,1.0000,"A longitudinal study of 44 haemophilic children, all in a treatment programme with factor concentrates, was undertaken to evaluate the occurrence, characteristics, and evolution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Twenty four children (55%) (group I) showed signs of HBV infection, while 20 (45%) (group II) did not. Age at onset of treatment, number of infusions, and total amount of concentrate received did not show significant differences between the two groups. In group I only four children (16%) had symptomatic acute hepatitis. Chronic liver disease was present in nine patients (38% of infected children). The early age of infection would seem to be an important factor for predicting chronic evolution. Evidence of delta infection in three children with severe liver disease seemed to confirm the high pathogenicity of this agent. Because of the risks associated with chronic HBV infection a careful follow up of patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen is mandatory."
4084,0.005,1.0000,"The rate of progression to disease varies considerably among individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1). Analyses of semiannual blood samples obtained from six infected men showed that a rapid rate of CD4 T cell loss was associated with relative evolutionary stasis of the HIV-1 quasispecies virus population. More moderate rates of CD4 T cell loss correlated with genetic evolution within three of four subjects. Consistent with selection by the immune constraints of these subjects, amino acid changes were apparent within the appropriate epitopes of human leukocyte antigen class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Thus, the evolutionary dynamics exhibited by the HIV-1 quasispecies virus populations under natural selection are compatible with adaptive evolution."
4899,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the process of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution in vivo, a total of 179 HIV-1 V3 sequences derived from cell-free plasma were determined from serial samples in three epidemiologically linked individuals (one infected blood donor and two transfusion recipients) over a maximum period of 8 years. A systematic analysis of pairwise comparisons of intrapatient sequences, both within and between each sample time point, revealed a preponderance and accumulation of nonsynonymous rather than synonymous substitutions in the V3 loop and flanking regions as they diverged over time. This strongly argues for the dominant role that positive selection for amino acid change plays in governing the pattern and process of HIV-1 env V3 evolution in vivo and nullifies hypotheses of purely neutral or mutation-driven evolution or completely chance events. In addition, different rates of evolution of HIV-1 were observed in these three different individuals infected with the same viral strain, suggesting that the degree of positive pressure for HIV-1 amino acid change is host dependent. Finally, the observed similar rate of accumulation in divergence within and between infected individuals suggests that the process of genetic divergence in the HIV epidemic proceeds regardless of host-to-host transmission events, i.e., that transmission does not reset the evolutionary clock."
2620,0.005,1.0000,"Chemokines and their receptors are key factors in the onset and progression of AIDS. Among them, accumulating evidence strongly indicates the involvement of IL-8 and its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, in AIDS-related conditions. Through extensive investigation of genetic variations of the human CXCR1-CXCR2 locus, we identified a haplotype of the CXCR1 gene (CXCR1-Ha) carrying two nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, CXCR1_300 (Met to Arg) in the N terminus extracellular domain and CXCR1_142 (Arg to Cys) in the C terminus intracellular domain. Transfection experiments with CXCR1 cDNAs corresponding to the CXCR1-Ha and the alternative CXCR1-HA haplotype showed reduced expression of CD4 and CXCR4 in CXCR1-Ha cells in human osteosarcoma cells as well as in Jurkat and CEM human T lymphocytes. Furthermore, the efficiency of X4-tropic HIV-1(NL4-3) infection was significantly lower in CXCR1-Ha cells than in CXCR1-HA cells. The results were further confirmed by a series of experiments using six HIV-1 clinical isolates from AIDS patients. A genetic association study was performed by using an HIV-1(+) patient cohort consisting of two subpopulations of AIDS with extreme phenotypes of rapid and slow progression of the disease. The frequency of the CXCR1-Ha allele is markedly less frequent in patients with rapid disease onset than those with slow progression (P = 0.0003). These results provide strong evidence of a protective role of the CXCR1-Ha allele on disease progression in AIDS, probably acting through modulation of CD4 and CXCR4 expression."
7675,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance results from the accumulation of mutations in the viral genes targeted by the drugs. These genetic changes, however, are commonly detected and monitored by techniques that only take into account the dominant population of plasma virus. Because HIV-1-infected patients harbor a complex and diverse mixture of virus populations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence and the evolution of resistance are not fully elucidated. Using techniques that allow the quantification of resistance mutations in minority virus species, we have monitored the evolution of resistance in plasma virus populations from patients failing protease inhibitor treatment. Minority populations with distinct resistance genotypes were detected in all patients throughout the evolution of resistance. The emergence of new dominant genotypes followed two possible mechanisms: (i) emergence of a new mutation in a currently dominant genotype and (ii) emergence of a new genotype derived from a minority virus species. In most cases, these population changes were associated with an increase in resistance at the expense of a reduction in replication capacity. Our findings provide a preliminary indication that minority viral species, which evolve independently of the majority virus population, can eventually become dominant populations, thereby serving as a reservoir of diversity and possibly accelerating the development of drug resistance."
9246,0.005,1.0000,"Most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission in developing countries occurs through heterosexual intercourse or during birth from mother to child. It is critical to characterize the virus of the genital tract variants as a target for the development of an HIV-1 vaccine and microbicidal therapies. We compared the C2V3 env domain genetic diversity of HIV-1 in female genital secretions and in plasma from Ethiopian women seeking care for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Sequences within an individual differed between the plasma and cervicovaginal lavage (CLV) compartments with nucleotide and amino acid median difference values of 8.3 and 4.8%, respectively. Sequence diversity in CVL was greater than in plasma. And the V3 loop positive charge was often more elevated in CVL. These are markers of the differential evolution of the viruses in CVL and peripheral blood indicating that limited evolution at the site of contact is not the limiting factor determining the preferential transmission of macrophage tropic viruses."
1870,0.005,1.0000,"In order to understand the significance of presence of HIV-1 in saliva, we searched for by PCR HIV-1 proviral sequences in the saliva cells of 49 HIV-1 infected patients. Seven out 49 specimens resulted positive, 4 of which were from patients with PGL, 1 with ARC and 2 with AIDS. Four patients had a CD4+ lymphocyte counts < 200/cmm and in 3 patients the CD4+ lymphocyte count ranged from 200 to 400/cmm. Two patients were treated with AZT, 1 with DDI and 4 had no antiretroviral treatment. In conclusion, although HIV-1 proviral sequences have been found in saliva of HIV-1 infected patients, a larger group of patients should be investigated to define more precisely the role of HIV-1 in saliva."
5380,0.005,1.0000,"Although zidovudine (ZDV) is effective in HIV-1-infected patients, the duration of its efficacy may be short when treatment is started in advanced HIV disease. This pilot prospective case-control study was designed to evaluate the combination of ZDV plus didanosine [ddI] compared with ZDV monotherapy as an initial therapeutic strategy. 'Control' patients (ZDV monotherapy) were matched with 'case' patients (ZDV plus ddI combination therapy) according to the presence or absence of AIDS-defining criteria at entry and CD4 cell count. The case patient group consisted of 35 consecutive HIV-1-infected individuals with < or = 300 CD4 cells/mm3, no previous experience of antiretroviral therapy and who accepted treatment with a combination of ZDV plus ddI. The control patient group consisted of 35 consecutive patients with similar characteristics, but who preferred to start treatment with ZDV alone. Control patients received 250 mg ZDV bid and case patients received ZDV at the same dose plus ddI (200 mg bid). Primary study endpoints were virological (serum HIV-1 RNA) and immunological (CD4 cell count) responses. Viral phenotype (syncytium-inducing (SI) or non-syncytium-inducing (NSI)), development of mutations at codons 215, 41 and 74 and clinical progression (new AIDS-defining event or death) were also assessed. Virological and CD4 cell count responses were significantly greater and more sustained in the group treated with ZDV plus ddI than in the control group, with peak responses of -1.2 +/- 0.7 log10 versus -0.3 +/- 0.4 log10 at 1 month (P = 0.0003) and 61 +/- 52 cells/mm3 versus 19 +/- 25 cells/mm3 at 2 months (P = 0.001), respectively. In both groups the percentage of patients developing a mutation at codon 215 was around 80 per cent at 12 months. A mutation at codon 74 was detected in 30 per cent of case patients at 12 months.

We treated 7 patients with diagnosed AIDS who did not respond to eight or more antiretroviral therapies in an open label pilot study with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), ABC, ddI, amprenavir (APV), and ritonavir (RTV), with or without efavirenz (EFV). Therapy was well tolerated despite the patients' advanced disease states. No significant decline in lymphocyte or other blood counts was observed. Median HIV RNA was 5.26 log10 copies/ml at entry, 4.53 log10 copies/ml at 4 weeks, and 5.13 log10 copies/ml at 16 weeks. Median CD4+ count was 34 cells/microl at entry and 39 cells/microl at 16 weeks of therapy. CD4+ counts increased further in five study subjects on extended therapy to 25 weeks (median 27 cells/microl at entry, 66 cells/microl at close), despite loss of virologic suppression in 4 of 5 cases. MPA can induce apoptosis in lymphocytes in vitro. However despite viral rebound, cell surface markers of apoptosis and activation declined in total CD3+ cells and CD3+/CD4+ cells twofold to fourfold in 4 of 5 adherent study subjects at 16 weeks, reaching levels comparable with those found in seronegative donors. Although low-dose MMF appears safe in late-stage HIV disease, this study did not demonstrate virologic efficacy. Higher doses of MMF may be more effective. With careful monitoring of toxicities and pharmacokinetics, MMF deserves further testing in HIV therapy."

To further define treatment responses to new antiretroviral therapy in patients with long-term experience to dual nucleoside analog therapy (zidovudine [ZDV] plus didanosine [ddI] or ZDV plus zalcitabine [ddC]), 325 subjects derived from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 175 trial were randomized to three different combination regimens: (1) continuation of ZDV + ddI or ZDV + ddC (continuation arm), (2) addition of 3TC to ZDV + ddI or ZDV + ddC (addition arm), or (3) a switch to ZDV + 3TC therapy (switch arm). Both the addition and switch arms sustained significantly greater short-term (baseline to week 4) mean CD4+ cell count increases compared with the continuation arm (+36, +28 versus -4 cells/mm3; p = 0.012) and long-term CD4+ cell count responses (baseline to weeks 40/48: +32, +19 versus -9 cells/mm3; p = 0.003). Superior short-term (baseline to week 8) mean decreases in plasma HIV RNA (p < 0.001) were achieved by both the addition and switch arms (0.53 log10 and 0.54 log10 copies/ml, respectively) compared with the continuation arm (0.13 copies/ml) whereas no differences in long-term virologic suppression were observed (p = 0.30). At week 48, no differences were observed in the proportions of subjects who had HIV RNA levels below 500 copies/mL: 18% of subjects in each treatment arm (3-way p = 1.0). Overall, the treatments were well tolerated and only nine subjects (3%) died or developed one or more AIDS-defining events. While this study confirms the intrinsic antiretroviral activity of 3TC, only modest marker changes and limited short-term viral suppression are seen with incremental addition of the drug. The current approach of using 3TC in maximally suppressive regimens is preferred."
6689,0.005,1.0000,"One of the hallmarks of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes which precedes the progression from an asymptomatic state to AIDS. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is one of the mechanisms proposed to mediate this depletion. Infectious and inactivated preparations of HIV-1LAI were compared for their potential to induce apoptosis. Analysis with fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the DNA intercalative compound propidium iodide demonstrated that apoptosis occurred only with infectious HIV-1, implying that cell surface binding and signalling by the virus alone were insufficient to trigger apoptosis. Apoptosis was further confirmed by the presence of characteristic digestion of host cell DNA and morphologically by nuclear condensation observed by transmission electron microscopy. HIV infection of CD4+ T cell lines generated an accumulation of the cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and cells undergoing apoptosis appeared to originate from the pool of cells in the G1 phase. Inhibitors of HIV replication were used to identify the point in the virus replicative cycle at which apoptosis is induced. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ddI, or the HIV protease inhibitor, RO31-8959 (Saquinavir), were added either 2 h before or 6 h after HIV inoculation. Only ddI inhibited HIV-induced apoptosis when added before inoculation; however, neither treatment was effective in preventing HIV-induced apoptosis when applied 6 h after inoculation. These data indicate that apoptosis requires a single round of reverse transcription and the expression of virion proteins, but not the maturation of progeny virions. Two agents which compete with HIV for binding to CD4+ T cells, dextran sulphate and the anti-CD4 MAb Leu3a, were effective at preventing apoptosis when added 6 h after infection, implying that a subsequent gp120-CD4 interaction at the surface of an infected cell was required to complete the apoptotic process."

All except 7 females were injecting drug users. While 34 patients had thrombocytopenia, 3 had severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 20 000/microL). Although prevalence was similar in various stages of HIV infection (18.5%-22.5%), severe thrombocytopenia was in patients with CD4 T cell count < 200 cells/microL. There were no other associated conditions. Mild thrombocytopenia is common in HIV-infected patients in our region."

A 59-year-old man with a 3-year history of liver cirrhosis was introduced to our department because of oliguria, proteinuria and microscopic haematuria. He, with negative serum HBV surface antigen, was not detected HBV DNA in his serum. Renal biopsy was performed and was compatible with a diagnosis of hepatitis B virus-related membranous nephropathy (HBV-MN). The patient was prescribed diuretics and intravenous albumin, and his ascites and oedema remitted gradually. At the same time, entecavir 0.5 mg per day was started. Entecavir treatment was continuing for 3.5 years and finally resulted in complete remission of proteinuria. This suggests that entecavir monotherapy may induce and maintain complete remission of MN associated with OBI."

Serum hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA increased during prednisolone pretherapy and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was increasing after withdrawal of prednisolone. Clearance of HBV-DNA with hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion and ALT normalization occurred within 2 months after starting lamivudine therapy. If this dramatic response to lamivudine therapy after corticosteroid priming is confirmed by further studies, the regimens used in this particular case might become a powerful therapeutic tool for chronic HBV infection."

We report a 28-year-old woman who presented with Candida oesophagitis with underlying chronic hepatitis C. The patient presented with anorexia and weakness and was noted to have raised serum transaminases. Upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed Candida oesophagitis involving the whole oesophagus. Oesophageal biopsy demonstrated changes consistent with Candida oesophagitis. Serology was positive for hepatitis C antibodies, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyped hepatitis C virus (HCV) as genotype 3. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis with moderately active portal inflammation. A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test was non-reactive for types 1 and 2. The development of Candida oesophagitis in a patient with chronic HCV infection demands prompt consideration of general debility and immunosuppression as effects of HCV that led to an occurrence of opportunistic infection. Evaluation of this case provides insight into various mechanisms of immune suppression associated with HCV infection."
8419,0.005,1.0000,"We present a case report of a Japanese patient who showed prolonged infection after acute hepatitis B with genotype H. The patient was a 60-year-old man who underwent an annual health care check every year for several years and was never pointed out to have any liver damage, and markers for hepatitis B and C were negative. He was found to be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at his health care check in December 2005. After one month, he had an elevated aminotransferase level with hepatitis B e antigen and a high level of serum HBV DNA. He was diagnosed as having acute hepatitis B. On HBV genotype, he had genotype H by the direct sequence method, and he was given a 100 mg of lamivudine daily. However, his acute hepatitis tended to go toward prolonged infection. After two months, he was treated with interferon daily for 28 days. He had negative HBsAg in August 2006. Genotype H, the newest type of hepatitis B, could be the type which shows a poor response to lamivudine. The present paper is the first report, describing the clinical course of acute hepatitis B with genotype H from onset to remission."

Treatment commenced with a daily dose of 6 MU IFN alpha-2b for 2 weeks, which was changed to three times weekly thereafter. After 2 weeks, HCV RNA in the serum was undetectable and there was a concomitant reduction in proteinuria. Treatment with IFN alpha-2b was discontinued because of severe headache and fever. Five weeks after the discontinuation of IFN alpha-2b, the patient experienced the sudden onset of visual loss due to retinal hemorrhage. Subsequently, proteinuria and renal function progressively deteriorated though HCV RNA was undetectable. This case exemplifies the need for careful monitoring of renal function and retinal lesions not only in patients receiving IFN but also in those following the discontinuation of IFN treatment."

The prevalence of autoimmune diseases, associated with or occurring in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, has been increasing. We describe a 58-year-old man with an undiagnosed HIV infection, which presented as chronic cervical lymphadenopathy with an elevated serum IgG4 and a very high IgE. Histologically, lymph nodes showed expanded sinusoids and burnt-out germinal centers with increased plasmacytic infiltration and collagen fiber deposition. The absolute number of IgG4+ plasma cells and the IgG4+/IgG+ plasma cell ratio was increased. The lymph nodes were enlarged and clinically the patient improved after steroid treatment. Nine months later, he was diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, following presentation with a cavitary left lung lesion. Immunohistochemical studies on the previously resected lymph node revealed complete absence of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and increased CD8+ T-lymphocytes. The pathologic findings met the criteria of both HIV infection and IgG4-related lymphadenopathy. Our case demonstrates that further investigations for underlying HIV infection in a case of IgG4-RD are critical, especially when extremely elevated IgE is concomitantly present."

Clinical studies have been performed to determine the efficacy of different specimens and diagnostic systems for the provision of clinically useful information. Our approach has been to provide medical care on an outpatient basis using less invasive diagnostic systems that do not require direct physician participation. Direct laboratory examination of a single specimen submitted to microbiology often yielded presumptive or final diagnoses that were directly communicated to the physician. The evolution of PCP diagnosis in AIDS patients is described. Our current procedure of examining mucolysed, concentrated induced sputum stained with a rapid Giemsatype stain, Diff-Quik (Baxter/Scientific Products, McGaw, IL), has a sensitivity for P carinii detection of 74% to 77%. We have found that the use of commercially available immunofluorescence staining diminishes screening time and increases the sensitivity of P carinii detection in mucolysed concentrated induced sputum. We also describe the appearance of bacterial, fungal, and parasitic agents seen on direct examination and the usefulness of antigen detection, serology, and various microbiologic culture systems for diagnosing infections caused by these organisms."
8192,0.005,1.0000,"In a prospective cohort study of 265 laboratory and affiliated workers, one individual with no recognized risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was HIV-1 seropositive at the time of entry into the study. Molecular analyses of two HIV-1 isolates derived in two independent laboratories from a blood sample from this worker showed that the isolates were indistinguishable from a genotypic form of HIV-1 present in the H9/HTLV-IIIB cell line. Exposure to this strain of virus most probably occurred during work with concentrated virus or culture fluids from virus-producing cell lines under standard Biosafety Level 3 containment. Although no specific incident leading to this infection has been identified, undetected skin contact with virus culture supernatant might have occurred. This worker was the only one found to be positive among the subgroup of 99 workers who shared a work environment involving exposure to concentrated virus. The incidence rate of 0.48 per 100 person-years exposure indicates that prolonged laboratory exposure to concentrated virus is associated with some risk of HIV-1 infection, which is comparable to the risk for health care workers experiencing a needle stick exposure. While none of the ten workers with parenteral exposure to HIV-1 in this cohort became infected, a worker in another laboratory did seroconvert following an injury with a potentially contaminated needle. Strict Biosafety Level 3 containment and practices should be followed when working with concentrated HIV-1 preparations, and further refinement of the procedures may be necessary."
240,0.005,1.0000,"The genetic heterogeneity and transcription activity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) LTR region and tat gene have been examined. Comparison involved the relevant genomic regions of viruses isolated from twenty long-term survivors and from ten typical progressors. No significant differences were observed in mutation frequencies among the two groups, although there was a significant higher proportion of synonymous substitutions in the tat gene of viruses from typical progressors. Four LTR sequences showed an insertion of 20-31 residues at the junction between the LTR Nef-coding and the LTR noncoding region. Neither these insertions nor other genetic changes found in these sequences affected the LTR transcription function, as measured in transient expression assays using transfection of both established cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes with plasmid DNA. The results did not allow the association of structural or functional alterations in LTR or tat with a degree of disease progression. The results reinforce the concepts of complexity of HIV-1 evolution in infected individuals, and the multifactorial nature of progression to AIDS."
9617,0.005,1.0000,"Unintegrated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA are viral DNA products formed naturally during HIV replication. While the integrated proviral DNA form is transcriptionally active and results in productive infection, unintegrated DNA is also capable of expression of viral RNA and proteins. Previously, we showed that HIV Vpr enhances expression from integrase-defective HIV. Here we show that Vpr activation of expression is partially dependent upon the presence of a transcriptionally active HIV promoter and results in increased transcription of unspliced gag and spliced nef viral RNA. While Tat is detectable during infection with integrase-defective HIV, Tat levels are not affected by the presence of Vpr. Mutation studies reveal that Tat is dispensable for the Vpr-mediated enhancement of expression from unintegrated DNA. We find that virion-associated Vpr is sufficient for Nef expression from unintegrated viral DNA, resulting in the efficient downregulation of CD4 from the surface of infected cells. These results provide a mechanism by which Nef expression from unintegrated HIV type 1 DNA expression occurs."
6037,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often causes latent infection. Transactivation by some DNA viruses has been implicated in inducing HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis. The transactivator (IE-2) gene of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) can enhance HIV-2 as well as HIV-1 gene expression in vitro. This inducer can act in concert with the HIV-2 tat gene and T-cell activation in enhancing gene expression in human CD4+ lymphocytes. While the HIV-2 and HIV-1 tat genes and T-cell activators apparently employ independent modes of action, the CMV transactivator in combination with the HIV-2 tat or T-cell activators may employ a gene activation pathway with some common and some distinct components. Both HIV-2 and CMV transactivators enhance HIV-2 gene expression by transcriptional activation involving transcript initiation as well as elongation, with CMV transactivator affecting elongation more than the initiation. A significant proportion of transcripts appear to terminate prematurely in the absence of transactivators. Deletion mutation analysis of the HIV-2 long terminal repeat (LTR) suggests that the element that responds to CMV transactivation in human CD4+ lymphocytes is either a diffuse one or located downstream of the HIV-2 enhancer element."

At the start all the men had persistent core antigenaemia; the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome developed in 6 during the study. The polymerase chain reaction was used to detect mutations at residue 215 of reverse transcriptase, a mutation associated with reduced drug sensitivity. After 2 years 16/18 isolates were mutant. However, after about 6 months of treatment the mutation was detected in only 7 isolates, 4 from individuals who subsequently had AIDS. Limited direct virus sensitivity data correlated with the genetic data. The rate of appearance of the 215 mutation seemed to correlate with CD4 counts and viral virulence."
9359,0.005,1.0000,"The G-->A mutation of nucleotide (nt) 1896 in the precore region of hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevents production of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) by creating a TAG stop codon. This mutation is often found in anti-HBe-positive patients with productive HBV infection and has been associated with severe chronic and fulminant hepatitis in some geographic areas. Emergence of the TAG mutation during HBe seroconversion was studied as was its relationship with nt 1858, which forms a base pair with nt 1896 in the pregenomic RNA loop. A TAG mutant evolved in 18 (72%) of 25 patients with a T-1858 strain but in only 1 (8%) of 13 with a C-1858 strain. Viremia with C-1858 strains was, despite their limited ability to develop the TAG mutation, as persistent as with T-1858 strains. Generally, T-1858-infected patients in whom a TAG mutant did not emerge were HBV DNA-negative by polymerase chain reaction on follow-up, whereas patients who developed the TAG mutation had prolonged viremia."
246,0.005,1.0000,"The outcome of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is variable, influenced by host and viral factors. From 1982 through 2004, 301 patients with acute HBV infection entered a multi-center cross-sectional study in Japan. Patients with fulminant hepatitis (n = 40) were older (44.7 +/- 16.3 vs. 36.0 +/- 14.3 years, P < .0017), less predominantly male (43% vs. 71%, P = .0005), less positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (23% vs. 60%, P < .0001), less infected with subgenotype Ae (0% vs. 13%, P < .05), and more frequently with Bj (30% vs. 4%, P < .0001) than those with acute self-limited hepatitis (n = 261). Precore (G1896A) and core-promoter (A1762T/G1764A) mutations were more frequent in patients with fulminant than acute self-limited hepatitis (53% vs. 9% and 50% vs. 17%, P < .0001 for both). HBV infection persisted in only three (1%) patients, and they represented 2 of the 23 infected with Ae and 1 of the 187 with the other subgenotypes (9% vs. 0.5%, P = .032); none of them received antiviral therapy. In multivariate analysis, age 34 years or older, Bj, HBeAg-negative, total bilirubin 10.0 mg/dL or greater, and G1896A mutation were independently associated with the fulminant outcome. In in vitro transfection experiments, the replication of Bj clone was markedly enhanced by introducing either G1896A or A1762T/G1764A mutation. In conclusion, persistence of HBV was rare (1%) and associated with Ae, whereas fulminant hepatitis was frequent (13%) and associated with Bj and lack of HBeAg as well as high replication due to precore mutation in patients with acute HBV infection."

We studied patterns and accrual of drug resistance mutations in a Cambodian CRF01_AE-infected cohort continuing a virologically failing first-line, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor- (NNRTI-) based, HAART. Between 2005 and 2007, 837 adult HIV-infected patients had regular plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load measurements at Sihanouk Hospital Centre of Hope (SHCH), Cambodia. Drug resistance testing was performed in all patients with HIV-1 RNA >1000 copies/ml after at least 6 months of HAART. Seventy-one patients with a mean age of 34 years, of whom 68% were male, were retrospectively assessed at virological failure. The median duration of antiretroviral therapy was 12.3 (IQR 7.1-18.23) months, the median CD4 cell count was 173 (IQR 118-256) cells/mm(3), and the mean plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 3.9 log (SD 0.72) at failure. NNRTI mutations, M184I/V mutation, thymidine analogue mutations, and K65R were observed in 78.9%, 69%, 20%, and 12.7% of patients, respectively. For 33 patients, genotypic testing was carried out on at least two occasions before the switch to second-line HAART after a median duration of 5.8 (IQR 4.3-6.1) months of virological failure: 54.5% of patients accumulated new mutations with a rate of 1.6 mutations per person-year. Accumulation was seen both for nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and also in patients with low-level viremia. Subtype-specific data on mutation type, rate, and accumulation after HAART failure are urgently needed to optimize treatment strategies in resource-limited settings."
2448,0.005,1.0000,"Previously, our laboratory showed that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) activates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in brain-derived cells with limited HIV-1 gene expression but inhibits HIV-1 in cells fully permissive for replication of both viruses (F. M. Jault, S. A. Spector, and D. H. Spector, J. Virol. 68:959-973, 1994). To investigate these effects further, we developed a model system that uncouples HIV-1 gene expression from long terminal repeat (LTR) activity. Two monoclonal U373-MG astrocytoma/glioblastoma cell lines (LTRIG and LIGHIVDC) were generated, each containing an integrated copy of an LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct and the Escherichia coli lacI gene. LIGHIVDC also has an inducible HIV-1 genome controlled by a Rous sarcoma virus promoter with lac operator sequences. Basal LTR-mediated CAT activity is 65-fold higher in LIGHIVDC than in LTRIG, and this activity is further increased (20-fold) following incubation of LIGHIVDC with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Tat protein can be detected by immunostaining in LIGHIVDC. However, Rev-mediated transport and subsequent translation of the singly spliced and unspliced HIV-1 mRNAs is inefficient. In the absence of Tat, HCMV stimulated CAT activity approximately 20-fold, and this activation required HCMV gene expression but not viral DNA replication. LTR-directed transcription was unaffected by HCMV infection in LIGHIVDC but was inhibited in these cells when they contained increased Tat levels following IPTG induction. These results support the hypothesis that HCMV can induce the HIV-1 LTR when HIV-1 gene expression is minimal and that a threshold level of HIV-1 gene products is necessary for HCMV to inhibit this promoter."

In 70% of the patients with diarrhea, at least one potential enteropathogen was detected. Stool virus was detected by electron microscopy in 17% (44 of 256), adenovirus in 6.6% (17 of 256), and coronavirus in 11.3% (29 of 256) of the patients. Adenovirus and coronavirus were detected more frequently in patients with diarrhea than in patients without diarrhea [adenovirus 10% (13 of 136) vs. 3.3% (4 of 120), p = 0.0129; coronavirus 15% (21 of 136) vs. 6.6% (8 of 120), p = 0.0142]. Sixty-one percent of patients harboring stool virus were coinfected by another enteropathogen. Pathogens other than stool virus were detected more frequently in patients harboring adenovirus (82%) than in patients without stool virus (48%, p < 0.025). Adenovirus and coronavirus are frequently detected in stools of HIV- infected patients and may contribute to diarrhea. Adenovirus infection may facilitate the occurrence of other intestinal pathogens. Due to frequent coinfections, detection of stool viruses reduces the rate of diarrhea of unknown origin only by approximately 5%."

The aims of this study were to investigate the frequency of detection of microsporidia associated with diarrhoea in patients with advanced HIV disease in the north west of England, and to determine the species involved and their prevalence. During the period from April 1992 to the end of December 1995, chronic diarrhoea in 88 patients in the late stage of HIV disease was investigated. Duodenal biopsies, duodenal aspirates or jejunal biopsies were received from 38 patients, and stool samples from 63 patients, as part of the routine investigation of possible causes of diarrhoea in these patients. Biopsies and aspirates were examined by thin-section electron microscopy (EM), and stool samples were examined by epi-fluorescence microscopy after staining with Calcofluor. Putative stool positives were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. CD4-lymphocyte counts were available from all patients who provided samples. Nine out of 63 patients (14.3%) were found to be excreting microsporidial spores on stool examination. The species was confirmed as Enterocytozoon bieneusi. The mean CD4-lymphocyte count for this group was 37 x 10(6)/L (normal range 517-1677 x 10(6)/L). Three out of 38 biopsy specimens (7.9%) were also found to be infected with this microsporidian. The mean CD4-lymphocyte count for this group was 72 x 10(6)/L. Encephalitozoon intestinalis was not found in any samples examined. The prevalence of microsporidial infection in AIDS patients in the north west of England appears to be similar to that of patients in London, but less than that reported in studies from other developed countries."

We conducted a prospective study at the cholera treatment center (CTC) of GHESKIO in Haiti to characterize the coinfection. Adults admitted at the CTC for acute diarrhea were invited to participate in the study. Vital signs, frequency, and volume of stools and/or vomiting were monitored, and single-dose doxycycline was administered. After counseling, participants were screened for HIV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for cholera by culture. Of 729 adults admitted to the CTC, 99 (13.6%) had HIV infection, and 457 (63%) had culture-confirmed cholera. HIV prevalence was three times higher in patients without cholera (23%, 63/272) than in those with culture-confirmed cholera (7.9%, 36/457). HIV prevalence in patients with culture-confirmed cholera (7.9%) was four times higher than the adult prevalence in Port-au-Prince (1.9%). Of the 36 HIV-infected patients with cholera, 25 (69%) had moderate/severe dehydration versus 302/421 (72%) in the HIV negative. Of 30 HIV-infected patients with weekly stool cultures performed after discharge, 29 (97%) were negative at week 1.

The anti-HCV was performed by third generation immunoenzymatic technique, and the HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction. The overall prevalence of hepatitis C virus was 16% (CI: 12.4 - 19.6). Multivariate analysis showed association between virus C infection and age, with significant risk in the group about fifty years old or more (OR=9.75), blood transfusion (OR=4.74) and use of injecting drugs (OR=149.28). The hepatitis C virus infection was detected in 83.7% of intravenous drug users and 22.1% of transfused patients. These data indicate the efficient transmission of the virus through the percutaneous exposition and reaffirm the high risk to hepatitis C among injectable illicit drug user."
6583,0.005,1.0000,"The mortality due to chronic liver disease, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ranks as one of the highest in Korea. The prevalence rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in the general Korean population are approximately 1 and 5%, respectively. Blood transfusion was the strongest risk factor for the transmission of HCV infection. Therefore, the evaluation of risk factors for HCV infection including blood transfusion, intravenous drug user, hemophilia, and hemodialysis, is important. The most prevalent HCV genotype is 1b followed by 2a. The annual incidence of HCC among HCV-related liver cirrhosis has been estimated at 5%, and approximately 12% of HCC is attributable to HCV and 68% to HBV in Korea. HCV infection is more closely associated with HCC in elderly patients than HBV-related HCC. Even though the prevalence of anti-HCV in Korea has been reduced and the risk of HCV transmission through blood transfusion has markedly decreased, public-health programs to prevent de novo infections should be developed. This review describes the HCV prevalence and risk factors among the general population, and the distribution of HCV genotypes as well as the clinical course of HCV in Korea."

There was considerable overlap and transitioning between crack smoking and injecting. Crack users were also significantly more likely to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual than other drug users. In multivariate analysis, HIV infection was independently associated with crack use and with being gay or bisexual. In New York City, HIV prevention for drug users has focused on syringe access, safe injection, and drug user treatment, but further progress in HIV control will require strategies to address sexual health among people who use drugs. The study's limitations are noted."
2472,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of human T-cell leukaemia virus-I and -II infection was studied in a cohort of 346 intravenous and nonintravenous drug users in Amsterdam. Three participants (0.86%) had antibodies to HTLV-I by two commercially available HTLV-I enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Infection in these three subjects was confirmed by radioimmunoprecipitation assay. In the immunoblot study, only two of the three subjects were considered positive, since the serum of the third subject had antibodies to p24 only. By means of the polymerase chain reaction two participants (male intravenous drug users infected with human immunodeficiency virus; HIV) appeared to be infected with HTLV-I and one subject (a male nonintravenous drug user from Surinam) with HTLV-II. It is concluded that HTLV-I and HTLV-II circulate sporadically among drug users in Amsterdam and that risky injecting behaviour, which led to an HIV epidemic among intravenous drug users, has not led so far to an appreciable transmission of the other retroviruses among this group."

Eighty-one percent of participants were men; 59% were African American. Seventy-five percent experienced symptoms consistent with acute retroviral syndrome; although 83% sought medical care for these symptoms, only 15% were appropriately diagnosed at that initial medical visit, suggesting opportunities to diagnose these individuals earlier were missed. Eighty-five percent of the men engaged in sex with men. More than 50% of the participants thought they were infected with HIV by a steady partner.

7734,0.005,1.0000,"Cancers associated with immunosuppression and infections have long been recognized as a major complication of HIV/AIDS. More recently, persons living with HIV are increasingly diagnosed with a wider spectrum of HIV-associated malignancies (HIVAM) as they live longer on combination antiretroviral therapy. This has spurred research to characterize the epidemiology and determine the optimal management of HIVAM with a focus on low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Given background coinfections, environmental exposures, host genetic profiles, antiretroviral therapy usage, and varying capacities for early diagnosis and treatment, one can expect the biology of cancers in HIV-infected persons in LMICs to have a significant impact on chronic HIV care, as is now the case in high-income countries. Thus, new strategies must be developed to effectively prevent, diagnose, and treat HIVAM in LMICs; provide physical/clinical infrastructures; train the cancer and HIV workforce; and expand research capacity-particularly given the challenges posed by the limitations on available transportation and financial resources and the population's general rural concentration. Opportunities exist to extend resources supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria to improve the health-care infrastructure and train the personnel required to prevent and manage cancers in persons living with HIV. These HIV chronic care infrastructures could also serve cancer patients regardless of their HIV status, facilitating long-term care and treatment for persons who do not live near cancer centers, so that they receive the same degree of care as those receiving chronic HIV care today."

7859,0.005,1.0000,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has set a target of treating 3 million people with antiretroviral treatment (ART) by 2005. In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients could significantly contribute to this target. ART (stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine) was initiated in Thyolo district, Malawi, in April 2003, and all HIV-positive TB patients were considered eligible and offered ART. Despite this, only 44 (13%) of 352 TB patients were eventually started on ART by the end of November 2003. Most TB patients leave hospital after 2 weeks to complete the initial phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment (rifampicin-based) in the community, and ART is offered to HIV-positive TB patients after they have started the continuation phase of treatment (isoniazid/ ethambutol). ART is only offered at hospital, while the majority of TB patients take their continuation phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment from health centres. HIV-positive TB patients therefore find it difficult to access ART. In this paper, we discuss a series of options to increase the uptake of ART among HIV-positive TB patients. The main options are: 1) to hospitalise HIV-positive TB patients with a view to starting ART in the continuation phase in hospital; 2) to decentralise ART delivery so ART can be delivered at health centres; 3) to replace nevirapine with efavirenz so ART can be started earlier in the initial phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Decentralisation of ART from hospitals to health centres would greatly improve ART access."

This study evaluated the application of a BED enzyme immunoassay (EIA) on DBSs to estimate HIV incidence in a population-based study in India. The Calypte HIV-1 BED Incidence EIA was performed on 224 HIV-1-positive DBS samples, after screening 12 617 individuals from a population-based sample in Guntur district in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The number of recently infected HIV cases was identified using this BED assay and was used to estimate the annual HIV incidence rate based on calculations and adjustment formulae suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The updated BED data management software provided by the CDC was used for analyses. Of the 224 HIV-1 antibody-positive DBS samples, 29 (12.95 %) were estimated by the BED HIV-1 assay to have been infected within the past 155 days. After adjusting for age, gender and rural/urban distribution of the population, the annual incidence rate of HIV-1 infection was estimated to be 0.32 % (95 % confidence interval 0.20-0.44 %). This annual incidence was 18.6 % of the HIV prevalence of 1.72 % in this study. Thus, the BED assay revealed a higher incidence of HIV in this study than was expected from the prevalence. Correlation of the BED assay with panel testing and longitudinal incidence data in the Indian population is needed to calibrate it for use in India."
8565,0.005,1.0000,"By restoring the immunological function the modern antiretroviral treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection has considerably lowered the incidence of opportunistic infections. As opposed to the classical manifestations of HIV-induced immunosuppression the incidence and prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) has not noticeably decreased and HAND continues to be relevant in daily clinical practice. At present, HAND occurs in earlier stages of HIV infection, and the clinical course differs from that before the introduction of combination antiretroviral treatment (cART). The predominant clinical manifestation is a subcortical dementia with deficits in the domains attention, concentration and memory. Signs of central motor pathway lesions have become less frequent and less prominent. Prior to the advent of cART the cerebral dysfunction could at least partially be explained by the viral load and by virus-associated histopathological findings. In patients with at least partially successfully treated infections, this relationship no longer exists, but a plethora of poorly understood immunological and probably toxic phenomena are under discussion.This consensus paper summarizes the progress made in the last 12 years in the field of HAND and provides suggestions for the diagnostic and therapeutic management.

The questionnaires were administered to 75 patients at ten AACTG sites in the USA. All patients were taking combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), including at least one protease inhibitor. Eleven per cent of patients reported missing at least one dose the day before the interview, and 17% reported missing at least one dose during the two days prior. The most common reasons for missing medications included 'simply forgot' (66%) and a number of factors often associated with improved health, including being busy (53%), away from home (57%) and changes in routine (51%). Less adherent patients reported lower adherence self-efficacy (p = 0.006) and were less sure of the link between non-adherence and the development of drug resistance (p = 0.009). They were also more likely to consume alcohol, to be employed outside the home for pay and to have enrolled in clinical trials to gain access to drugs (all p < 0.05). Twenty-two per cent of patients taking drugs requiring special instructions were unaware of these instructions. Each questionnaire took approximately ten minutes to complete. Responses to the questionnaires were favourable. These questionnaires have been included in six AACTG clinical trials to date and have been widely disseminated to investigators both in the USA and abroad."
8747,0.005,1.0000,"In a previous paper, we determined that treatment of lymphocytes with nonviable preparations of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) results in an impairment of the phosphatidylinositol/protein kinase C pathway, most likely due to an inhibition of the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate into inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, mediated by phospholipase C. Here we show that one consequence of these changes is a reduced phosphorylation of nuclear matrix-associated DNA topoisomerase II, resulting in an inhibition of the activity of this enzyme. Antibodies to the viral proteins suppressed the inhibitory effects caused by the HIV-1 preparation. Furthermore, the phytohemagglutinin A-caused augmentation of nuclear matrix-associated DNA polymerase alpha and beta activities was found to be abolished by coincubation with the HIV preparation or with the HIV-1 gp120. The phytohemagglutinin A-enhanced matrix association and processivity of DNA polymerase alpha was determined to be reduced if the lymphocytes were in contact with HIV-1 preparation. These results suggest that the reduced proliferative response of lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin A in the presence of disrupted HIV-1 preparation is due to inhibition of at least two, perhaps separate, pathways, one involving protein kinase C resulting in a reduced phosphorylation of DNA topoisomerase II and the other changing the state of matrix association of DNA polymerase alpha and beta."

In this paper, we describe the conceptualisation of the Project HEART adherence intervention, characteristics of the participants, and lessons learned implementing HEART in an inner-city clinic setting. A multi-component intervention, HEART combined enhanced education, reminders, adherence feedback, social support and adherence-focused problem solving in an integrated manner to address common cognitive, motivational, and social barriers to adherence. Unique components of the intervention included use of participant-identified adherence support partners and a standardized adherence barriers assessment to develop and implement individualised adherence plans. Lessons learned regarding the feasibility of using participant-identified support partners were as follows. Few participants eligible for the study had trouble identifying a support partner. Over 90% of support partners attended at least one intervention visit. Support partners were most available and amenable to participate early in the initiation of therapy. Participants' experiences as the 'supported' partner were generally positive. Though many participants faced barriers not easily addressed by this intervention (for example, housing instability), formally integrating support partners into the intervention helped to address many other common adherence barriers. Family and friends are an under-utilised resource in HIV medication adherence. Enlisting the help of support partners is a practical and economical approach to adherence counselling."
6195,0.005,1.0000,"To determine behavioural risk factors associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity among 1104 youth aged 15-24 years we conducted a cross-sectional survey in Moshi rural district in northern Tanzania. Information was obtained about sociodemographic characteristics as well as sexual and reproductive health behaviour. Anonymous blood samples were taken for HIV testing. Positive HIV antibodies were determined and confirmed by two Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA). Of 1104 youth interviewed, 91% (1003) consented for blood specimen taking. Seven out of ten youth volunteered to have had sexual intercourse at least once in their lifetime; 60% reported to consume alcohol and 50% of the sexually experienced females reported to have received a gift for their sexual encounter. The overall HIV seroprevalence was 7.5% (75/1003); females compared to males were twice as likely to be HIV positive, 9.7% and 5% respectively. Behavioural risk factors associated with HIV seropositivity were different in male compared to female youth. Among male subjects, cigarette smoking, ever use of marijuana and having a past history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were significant risk factors associated with increased risk of HIV seropositivity. On the other hand, in females, those with a past or current history of STDs, those who volunteered that they practiced oral sex and subjects with four or more lifetime sexual partners were more likely to be HIV positive than subjects without a history of an STD, those with single sexual partner or had never practiced oral sex. A four fold increased risk of HIV seropositivity was also observed among female subjects with a history of blood transfusion in the previous 10 years compared to having received none, the Odds ratio was 4.1 (95% CI = 1.5, 11.1). The profile of risk behaviour associated with HIV seropositivity calls for an urgent need to target health information and education interventions to bring about a change in behaviour among the youth and hopefully help to reduce the rate of transmission of HIV infection."
4953,0.005,1.0000,"Darunavir boosted by low-dose ritonavir (DRV/r), at a daily dose of 600/100 mg twice a day (bid), has been shown to be superior to alternative highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens for the management of treatment-experienced, HIV-infected adults in the phase IIb POWER trials and the phase III TITAN trial. Economic analyses of different types that have been performed for several countries to investigate the cost effectiveness and budgetary impact of DRV/r 600/100 mg bid for treatment-experienced people living with HIV (PLHIV) based on the clinical data gathered in the POWER and TITAN trials are reviewed for consistency and their value to different decision-makers is assessed. Cost-utility analyses for the USA and several European countries indicate that DRV/r-based HAART is cost effective compared with other standard of care protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens in PLHIV with evidence of PI resistance. For all of these countries, the estimated cost-utility ratio is well below typical benchmark values and these ratios are robust, as demonstrated by one-way sensitivity and variability analyses and multi-way probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Studies using other metrics including the average 1-year drug cost per patient with a plasma HIV-RNA level less than 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks, the incremental drug cost per additional patient with a plasma HIV-RNA level less than 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks, the total (antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral) costs during the first year of treatment, and the total healthcare budget impact during the first 5 years of treatment provided further evidence of the positive economic outcomes with the use of DRV/r in treatment-experienced PLHIV. Different measures of economic outcomes are useful for different types of decision-makers and different types of decisions. In general, the results of these different types of analyses will be consistent with each other. For darunavir, the economic analyses reviewed in this paper demonstrate that the use of DRV/r 600/100 mg bid in the management of HIV-infected, treatment-experienced adults who have failed at least one of the other currently available PIs is cost effective and may be cost saving."

Consequently, increased switching from fixed-dose tablet TDF and emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) to abacavir and lamivudine (ABC/3TC) has occurred. Interestingly, while TDF has a lipid-lowering property, one of the ABC-related side effects is hyperlipidemia. Therefore, such switching could cause lipid elevation. To evaluate the change in lipid levels associated with switching from TDF/FTC to ABC/3TC in virologically-suppressed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Methods This is a retrospective, single-center study. We included the HIV-infected patients whose therapy included a drug switch from TDF/FTC to ABC/3TC between September 2009 and December 2012 at Ryukyu University Hospital. The exclusion criteria were HIV-RNA >40 copies/mL on the switching day, and a documented therapy change to a lipid-lowering agent or any other antiretroviral agents within 3 months before or after switching. We compared the low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) levels before switching to three months after. Results A total of 18 patients met the inclusion criteria. The LDL, HDL, and TC levels significantly increased three months following the switch (p<0.05), with median (interquartile range) values of 17 (7, 32), 6 (2, 13), and 27 (10, 45) mg/dL, respectively.

We evaluated the antiviral efficacy and safety of TDF alone compared to those of TDF plus LAM or telbivudine (LdT) combination in patients harboring HBV variants with genotypic resistance to LAM. This multicenter retrospective study included consecutive patients who had LAM-resistant HBV variants and were treated with TDF alone (monotherapy group) or TDF combined with LAM or LdT (combination therapy group) for at least 6 months. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) for the entire cohort was applied to control for treatment selection bias. Overall, 153 patients (33 in the monotherapy group and 120 in the combination therapy group) were analyzed. The overall probability of achieving complete virologic suppression at month 12 was 91.6%: 88.6% in the monotherapy group and 92.6% in the combination therapy group. Combination therapy was not superior to monotherapy in viral suppression before and after IPTW (P=0.562 and P=0.194, respectively). Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) loss, biochemical response, and virologic breakthrough did not differ between treatment groups. The probabilities of complete virologic suppression were comparable between treatment groups in the subsets according to HBeAg status and HBV DNA levels at baseline. No patient experienced any significant renal dysfunction during the treatment period. In conclusion, TDF monotherapy has antiviral efficacy comparable to that of TDF plus LAM or LdT combination therapy, with a favorable safety profile in CHB patients with LAM-resistant HBV variants."

A total of 641 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative and HBeAg-positive patients (129 with HVL) received 48 weeks of TDF 300 mg (HVL n = 82) or adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) 10 mg (HVL n = 47), followed by open-label TDF for an additional 192 weeks. Patients with confirmed HBV DNA ≥ 400 copies/mL on or after week 72 had the option of adding emtricitabine (FTC). By week 240, 98.3% of HVL and 99.2% of non-HVL patients on treatment achieved HBV DNA <400 copies/mL. Both groups had similar rates of histologic regression between baseline and week 240. Patients with HVL generally took longer to achieve HBV DNA <400 copies/mL than non-HVL patients, but by week 96, the percentages of patients with HBV DNA <400 copies/mL were similar in both groups. Among HVL patients, time to achieving HBV DNA <400 copies/mL was shorter among those initially receiving TDF, compared to ADV.

The combination of ADV or TDF with other nucleoside analogs is a proposed strategy for managing antiviral drug resistance during the treatment of chronic HBV infection. The antiviral effect of oral ADV or TDF, alone or in combination with 3TC or emtricitabine (FTC), against chronic woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection was evaluated in a placebo-controlled study in the woodchuck, an established and predictive model for antiviral therapy. Once-daily treatment for 48 weeks with ADV plus 3TC or TDF plus FTC significantly reduced serum WHV viremia levels from the pretreatment level by 6.2 log(10) and 6.1 log(10) genome equivalents/ml serum, respectively, followed by TDF plus 3TC (5.6 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), ADV alone (4.8 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), ADV plus FTC (one survivor) (4.4 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), TDF alone (2.9 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), 3TC alone (2.7 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), and FTC alone (2.0 log(10) genome equivalents/ml). Individual woodchucks across all treatment groups also demonstrated pronounced declines in serum WHV surface antigen, characteristically accompanied by declines in hepatic WHV replication and the hepatic expression of WHV antigens. Most woodchucks had prompt recrudescence of WHV replication after drug withdrawal, but individual woodchucks across treatment groups had sustained effects. No signs of toxicity were observed for any of the drugs or drug combinations administered. In conclusion, the oral administration of 3TC, FTC, ADV, and TDF alone and in combination was safe and effective in the woodchuck model of HBV infection."

Referral rate for HIV testing was 4.4% (30/684) in 2007, 15.4% (116/751) in 2008, and 30.1% (283/940) in 2009, with a significant upward trend over the period of time (P = .009). The main barriers perceived by health providers were poor knowledge about TB/HIV, lack of communication skills, absence of any target plan for TB patient referral for HIV testing, and fear associated with informing positive test results to the TB patients and the associated stigma. Strategies to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS/TB among TB patients and their providers may improve the current state of low referral and its barriers in Cambodia. "
1500,0.005,1.0000,"Anemia is often a comorbidity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Many cross-sectional studies have been conducted on anemia and HIV, but few, if any, have addressed incidence of anemia prospectively. A longitudinal analysis was conducted in 48,068 nonpregnant HIV-infected adults in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, seen at Management and Development for Health-U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief HIV care and treatment programs between 2004 and 2011. Almost 56% (N = 27,184) of study participants had anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) at the time of enrollment at the clinic. Female gender, low body mass index (BMI), low CD4 T-cell count, high levels of liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase, antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens, and concurrent tuberculosis treatment were all independently significantly associated with an increased risk of anemia. Low BMI and low CD4 T-cell count were independently significantly associated with an increased risk for iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Higher BMI status and ART use were associated with recovery from anemia. Anemia, including IDA, is a comorbidity that is associated with other adverse consequences (e.g., low BMI and CD4 T-cell count) among individuals with HIV infection, including those on ART. Interventions to prevent anemia and its complications need to be examined in the context of future studies. "
2089,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the availability of free or low-cost public sector human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) health-care services, important inequities in utilization exist. This study examined two measures of compliance with HIV medical care: attendance of scheduled outpatient visits and use of the emergency room. Clients of two public HIV outpatient clinics were followed from time of health-care initiation to either death or the end of the study. The association of race, sex, age, and injection drug use (IDU) with these measures were examined in multivariate logistic regression. Models were adjusted for disease staging at time of entry and for length of follow-up time in clinic. Of 1824 clients followed, 15% failed to attend scheduled visits and 18.1% had at least one emergency room visit. Clients who missed visits were more likely to be African American, to have a history of IDU, and to have a CD4 cell count < 500/mm3 or an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infection at entry. They were also more likely to have > or = 12 months of follow-up time in the HIV clinic, but were less likely to have entered into health care from an early intervention clinic. Clients who had at least one emergency room visit were more likely to be African American, female, IDU, and under 22 years of age; these clients were also more likely to have entered with CD4 < 200/mm3 or with an opportunistic infection, and to have > or = 12 months of follow-up in the clinic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
6888,0.005,1.0000,"Migration among persons with HIV/AIDS is common; however, it is not clear how migration relates to antiretroviral adherence, a key determinant of treatment efficacy. Therefore, our objective was to determine the scale of regional migration and its association with adherence patterns over time among HIV-infected individuals in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Participants initiated HAART in August 1996-November 2004, and were followed until November 2005. Adherence was defined as the number of days worth of antiretrovirals dispensed divided by the number of days of follow-up (expressed as a percentage), and considered a binary time-dependent outcome: 'non-adherence' (less than 95%) versus 'adherence' (95% or more). Migration was calculated as the cumulative number of times a patient's residential address changed during the course of treatment, and treated as a time-dependent variable. Non-linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the association between migration and adherence over time. All analyses were adjusted for relevant fixed and time-dependent variables. A total of 2421 participants were followed during the study period. Descriptive analysis demonstrated high stability in adherence over time, with more than 55% of patients moving at least once during the course of their treatment. We observed that those individuals migrating at least 3 times were 1.79 times more likely to be in the 'non-adherence' group than individuals who did not migrate. Our results demonstrate that migration in BC is not homogeneous across subpopulations. These results suggest that proactive strategies are needed to ensure that antiretroviral therapy remains available on a continued basis to highly migrant populations."
2102,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive individuals who adhere to their antiretroviral (ARV) regimens are more likely to achieve suppressed HIV viral load and improved immunologic response; however, for most patients, medication adherence remains a challenge. Prior studies have shown that clinical pharmacists contribute to the management of HIV-infected patients; but due to variability in clinical responsibilities and study limitations, their value has not been fully realized. The objective of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes of an HIV clinical pharmacist's interventions at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, who utilizes medication expertise to provide recommendations for ARV regimen changes. The pharmacist suggests new ARV regimens in order to attain virologic suppression, improve immunologic response, or minimize ARV adverse effects, while aiming to optimize patients' adherence by decreasing pill burden and/or dosing frequency. This retrospective study assessed the effectiveness of the pharmacist's interventions that occurred between 11 September 2006 and 30 September 2008 on pill burden, dosing frequency, and medication adherence. Additionally, CD4+ cell count and HIV viral load pre- and post-intervention were evaluated. Medication adherence was assessed utilizing electronic pharmacy refill records and calculated based on the formula: [(pills dispensed/pills prescribed per day)/days between refills] x 100. From a cohort of 75 patients, mean daily pill quantity and dosing frequency decreased from 7.2 pills/day and 2.0 times/day in the control phase to 5.4 pills/day and 1.5 times/day in the study phase, respectively ( p < 0.001). Medication adherence increased from a mean of 81% in the control phase to 89% in the study phase ( p = 0.003). Clinical outcomes measured by CD4+cell count and CD4% were statistically improved and more individuals achieved undetectable HIV viral loads postintervention ( p < 0.001). In conclusion, HIV clinical pharmacists may play an important role in reducing pill burden and dosing frequency, increasing medication adherence, and improving clinical outcomes."

6085,0.005,1.0000,"Acute HIV-1 infection is often manifested with a high level of viremia. The cell types and tissues/organs that contribute to the virus load are thought to be of central and peripheral lymphoreticular origin. The establishment and permissiveness of organ-based cell culture systems from spleen with laboratory strains or primary isolates of HIV-1 have not been reported. We studied unseparated splenic mononuclear cells (SMCs) and adherent cells derived from human spleen and liver in comparison with blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Unstimulated, SMCs were highly permissive to primary lymphotropic HIV-1 and dual/macrophage-tropic isolates (which are able to replicate in both MDMs and PBMCs). Furthermore, SMCs were found to replicate virus to high titer in a rapid log-phase manner and exhibited a prolonged stationary phase of virus production, unlike PBMCs, which required conventional activation with mitogens and exhibited a much shorter period of virus production. Interestingly, the SMCs maintained themselves as a mixed phenotype of nested lymphocytes with complex and well-differentiated macrophage(s) for extended periods of time. In addition, splenic macrophages readily purified by adherence were highly permissive to a dual/macrophage-tropic primary isolate, HIV-1ADA, intermediate with two laboratory strains, HIVR-1RF and HIV-lHXB3, and least permissive to the lymphotropic primary isolate HIV-1Mr452 and two other laboratory strains, HIV-1CC and HIV-1MN. The replication of HIV-1ADA as measured by extracellular p24 was sustained for up to 7 weeks and similar to the replication patterns observed with adherent hepatic macrophages and blood-derived MDMs. This study demonstrates that exogenous stimulation is not required for infection of these cells; either adherence-isolated and/or mixed lymphoid populations can be studied together, and viable stocks can be readily prepared and cryopreserved. In addition, these cells could be used for isolating new and/or other variants of HIV-1. Thus, the use of the SMC primary in vitro cell culture system for future studies involving HIV-1 is warranted."

A key factor in the effectiveness of ART is good adherence to the prescribed regimen for both individual well-being and public health. Poor adherence can contribute to the emergence of drug resistant strains of the virus and transmission during risky behaviors. Increased access to ART in low-income country settings has contributed to an interest in treatment adherence in resource-poor contexts. This study aims to investigate the proportion of adherence to ART and identify possible factors related to non-adherence to ART among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Lao PDR."
9276,0.005,1.0000,"In addition to their essential role in adaptive immunity, dendritic cells (DCs) participate in innate immunity. In the context of measles virus (MV) or cytomegalovirus infections, they develop cytotoxic functions that may contribute in vivo to the elimination of virus-infected cells, but that also kill infected and noninfected T lymphocytes. Because the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) induces T cell depletion through mechanisms that are still obscure, we investigated its ability to trigger DC cytotoxicity. When incubated with HIV, monocyte-derived DCs induced apoptosis in MDA-231 cells, which are sensitive to MV-induced DC cytotoxicity, and in uninfected as well as HIV-infected H9 CD4+ T cell lines. This apoptosis was inhibited by a mixture of FasL, TRAIL, TNF-alpha, and TWEAK inhibitors. Indeed, HIV infection induced or enhanced sensitivity to TRAIL, TNF-alpha, and TWEAK in H9 cells. Moreover, dendritic cells incubated with HIV-1 BAL or a wildtype HIV-1 isolate induced apoptosis in autologous primary CD4+ T lymphocytes, infected or not with a wild-type HIV-1 isolate. Therefore, induction of DC cytotoxicity by HIV may be relevant to in vivo HIV infection. Induction of cytotoxicity in DCs by HIV might contribute to HIV-associated T cell depletion through induction of apoptosis, especially in the early stages of infection. It may also contribute to elimination of infected cells in vivo, thereby enhancing cross-presentation of HIV by DCs. Therefore this new cytotoxic function of DCs may play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity during HIV infection."
258,0.005,1.0000,"Several members of the seven-transmembrane chemokine receptor family have been shown to serve, with CD4, as coreceptors for entry by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). While coreceptor usage by HIV-1 primary isolates has been studied by several groups, there is only limited information available concerning coreceptor usage by primary HIV-2 isolates. In this study, we have analyzed coreceptor usage of 15 primary HIV-2 isolates, using lymphocytes from a donor with nonfunctional CCR5 (CCR5 -/-; homozygous 32-bp deletion). Based on the infections of PBMCs, seven of these primary isolates had an absolute requirement for CCR5 expression, whereas the remaining eight exhibited a broader coreceptor usage. All CCR5-requiring isolates were non-syncytium inducing, whereas isolates utilizing multiple coreceptors were syncytium inducing. Blocking experiments using known ligands for chemokine receptors provided indirect evidence for additional coreceptor utilization by primary HIV-2 isolates. Analysis of GHOST4 cell lines expressing various chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR4, BONZO, and BOB) further defined specific coreceptor usage of primary HIV-2 isolates. The receptors used included CXCR4, CCR1-5, and the recently described receptors BONZO and BOB. However, the efficiency at which the coreceptors were utilized varied greatly among the various isolates. Analysis of V3 envelope sequences revealed no specific motif that correlated with coreceptor usage. Our data demonstrate that primary HIV-2 isolates are capable of using a broad range of coreceptors for productive infection in vitro. Additionally, our data suggest that expanded coreceptor usage by HIV-2 may correlate with disease progression."
1368,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-infected individuals have an increased risk of malignancy, especially non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. Recently, several workers have noted a raised prevalence of lung cancer in HIV-positive subjects. We describe the diagnosis and clinical course for four HIV-seropositive patients who presented with lung cancer. All of the patients were young and were heavy smokers. They were all on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), although the adherence varied from poor to excellent. The CD4 cell counts of these patients ranged from 200 to 686 cells/microL and their viral loads ranged from undetectable to 29,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. After initial diagnosis of HIV infection between 5 and 13 years previously, they all presented with advanced lung cancer, with a very short clinical course, and all four died within 2-9 months of diagnosis. A comparison of the incidence of lung cancer in patients with HIV infection at our centre with that in the general population suggests that there is an increased prevalence in the HIV-infected patients. We review the literature and discuss whether lung cancer in HIV infection is coincidental or related to the primary disease."

In this study, we systematically evaluated culture conditions that may affect the proliferation and expansion of CTL effector cells and presented a sensitive method for detection of cytotoxicity responses with bulk CTL cultures. We confirmed the sensitivity and specificity of this method by demonstration of vigorous CTL responses in a simian-HIV (SHIV)-infected rhesus macaque. The expansion of epitope-specific CTL effector cells was also measured quantitatively by CTL epitope-major histocompatibility complex tetramer complex staining. In addition, two new T-cell determinants in the SIV gag region are identified. Last, we showed the utility of this method for studying CTL responses in chimpanzee and human subjects."

We demonstrated that circulating CD4+ CD25+ T cells modulate the function and expansion of HBV-specific CD8+ cells ex vivo in all patients, regardless of whether they have chronic or resolved HBV infection. The possible role of CD4+ CD25+ T cells in the pathogenesis of chronic HBV infection is not supported by these data.

5591,0.005,1.0000,"Primary viral infections, including primary HIV infection, trigger intense activation of the immune system, with marked expansion of CD38(+)CD8(+) T cells. Whether this expansion involves only viral-specific cells or includes a degree of bystander activation remains a matter of debate. We therefore examined the activation status of EBV-, CMV-, and influenza virus (FLU)-specific CD8(+) T cells during primary HIV infection, in comparison to HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells. The activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR were strongly expressed on HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells. Surprisingly, CD38 expression was also up-regulated on CD8(+) T cells specific for other viruses, albeit to a lesser extent. Activation marker expression returned to normal or near-normal values after 1 year of highly active antiretroviral therapy. HIV viral load correlated with CD38 expression on HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells but also on EBV-, CMV-, and FLU-specific CD8(+) T cells. In primary HIV infection, EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells also showed increased Ki67 expression and decreased Bcl-2 expression, compared with values observed in HIV-seronegative control subjects. These results show that bystander activation occurs during primary HIV infection, even though HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells express the highest level of activation. The role of this bystander activation in lymphocyte homeostasis and HIV pathogenesis remains to be determined."
1105,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 2 infection is associated with a better clinical outcome, slower rates of CD4 T cell decline, and lower viremia than is HIV-1. This study compares HIV-1 and HIV-2 in regard to the percentages of interleukin (IL)-2-, interferon (IFN)-gamma-, and IL-4-producing cells at the single-cell level, as determined by flow cytometry. At a given degree of CD4 T cell depletion, the frequency of T cells able to produce IL-2 is better preserved in HIV-2 than in HIV-1 infection, particularly within the CD4 T cell subset. As described for HIV-1 immunodeficiency, HIV-2-positive patients exhibit a marked expansion of terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells (CD28(-)CD27(-)IFN-gamma(+)). However, the proportion of CD8 T cells able to simultaneously produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma is higher in HIV-2 disease. Considering the central role of IL-2 as a lymphocyte proliferative and survival factor, these findings provide a possible immunologic basis for the distinct course of HIV-2 immunodeficiency."

In contrast, no HIV-1-specific T cell responses were detected in any of the EU partners ex vivo or following in vitro expansion.

These two vectors, vCP205 encoding HIV-1 gp120 + TM (28 amino acid transmembrane anchor sequence) in addition to Gag/protease and vCP300 encoding gp120 + Gag/protease as well as Nef and Pol CTL determinants, are pancytotropic but replication incompetent in mammalian cells. Bulk peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or enriched CD8+ T cells were stimulated for 10 days with autologous ALVAC-infected PBMCs in the presence of different cytokine combinations (interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-4, IL-7, and IL-12). Activation by ALVAC constructs was highly antigen-specific, because vCP205 elicited only Env and Gag CTL, whereas vCP300 elicited broader reactivities against Env, Gag, Pol, and Nef determinants. The ALVAC activation of CTLp was IL-2 dependent and enhanced by the addition of IL-7, whereas IL-4 and IL-12 failed to augment cytotoxic reactivities elicited by these constructs. The expansion of enriched CD8+ T cells after activation with vCP300 was higher in patients with CD4 counts greater than 400 cells/microL. Two rounds of in vitro stimulation (IVS) with vCP300 resulted in nearly an eightfold expansion of CD8+ lymphocytes over a 25-day period. After the second IVS, an average 3.2-fold increase among the different antigen-specific CTL frequencies was achieved. These studies clearly show that HIV-recombinant ALVAC vectors represent powerful polyvalent antigenic stimuli for activation and expansion of the CD8 lymphocyte response that occurs as a result of HIV infection."
3978,0.005,1.0000,"GB virus C (GBV-C), which is highly prevalent among HIV/AIDS, seemed to slow the HIV disease progression. The HIV/GBV-C co-infected individuals may represent an interesting model for the investigation of the role played by HIV infection and/or the immune system in driving the evolution of the GBV-C viral populations. The present study investigated the prevalence and population dynamics of GB virus C in HIV infected individuals representing 13 geographic regions of Hubei Province of China. Approximately 37% of HIV-1 infected individuals were infected with GBV-C and genotype 3 is appeared to be predominant. Utilizing the 196 complete E2 nucleotide sequence data from 10 HIV/GBV-C infected individuals and employing coalescence based phylogenetic approaches; the present study has investigated the intra-host dynamics of GBV-C. The results revealed patient-specific unique GBV-C viral lineages and each viral lineage showed the evidence of rapid population expansion in respective HIV-1 infected patients, thus suggesting HIV-1 was unlikely to have been inhibiting effect on the GBV-C viral replication. GBV-C in all patients has experienced intense purifying selection, suggesting the GBV-C viral invasion and subsequent expansion within the HIV-1 infected hosts without any modification of the functional epitopes at their membrane protein. The finding of within host GBV-C recombinant sequences indicated recombination was one of the significant forces in the evolution and divergence of GBV-C."
2021,0.005,1.0000,"The effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy on cytokine imbalances associated with HIV-1 infection have not been characterized. Using single cell analysis by flow cytometry, we show that a significant recovery in the frequency of IL-2-producing cells was only observed in patients with a sustained control of viral replication and that the overexpanded CD8 T cell population of CD28- IFN-gamma + cells was not significantly reduced after 1 yr of effective therapy. Moreover, a detrimental role of IL-4 is suggested by the association between an enhanced proportion of IL-4-producing cells within the CD4 and particularly the CD8 subset and viral load rebound. Finally, the kinetics of changes of cell subsets assessed for simultaneous production of different cytokines supports the view that cell reconstitution during highly active antiretroviral therapy is initially due to redistribution of terminally differentiated cells, followed by peripheral expansion of less differentiated ones and a late progressive increase of the proportion of functionally defined naive/memory precursor lymphocytes. These data bring new support for the role of cytokine imbalances in AIDS pathogenesis and may be relevant for the definition of immunointervention targets."

Impaired HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses may underlie the persistently high viral loads observed in infants. We examined the frequency and phenotype of infant HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells in 7 HIV-infected antiretroviral therapy-naïve infants during the first 2 years of life, using class I HLA tetramers and IFN-γ-ELISPOT. The frequency (0.088-3.9% of CD3(+)CD8(+) cells) and phenotype (CD27(+)CD28(-), CD45RA(+/-), CD57(+/-), HLA-DR(+), CD95(+)) of infant HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells were similar to reports in adults undergoing early infection. Unlike adults, at 23-24 months post-infection a high frequency of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells expressed HLA-DR (mean 80%, range 68-85%) and CD95 (mean 88%, range 79-96%), suggesting sustained activation and vulnerability to apoptosis. Despite comparable expansion of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells of a similar phenotype to adults during early infection, infant T cells failed to contain HIV-1 replication, and remained persistently activated and vulnerable to apoptosis during chronic infection."

Mean age was 35.3 and 35.1 years, respectively. 156 individuals with a mean age of 28.3 years, confirmed as HIV-seronegative, served as controls. There were no significant differences in bleeding on probing, pocket formation or attachment loss among the HIV-seronegative individuals, HIV-seropositive and AIDS patients. We applied multiple logistic regression to calculate odds ratios for presence of periodontal conditions adjusting for age, gender and DMFT. Our odds ratios did not reveal any significant associations between bleeding on probing, pocket formation or attachment loss with regard to lymphocyte and CD4+ T-cell counts among the HIV-infected individuals and AIDS patients. When associations were investigated with regard to HIV-serostatus (HIV-seronegative, HIV-seropositive or AIDS), our adjusted odds ratios were insignificant, too. In fact, most odds ratios were close to 1. Thus, our study supports recent views that the presence, extent and severity of periodontal disease among HIV-infected individuals, may be less that hitherto thought."

He remained disease-free for 6 years and he achieved cure without chemotherapy. Although several cases of low-grade lymphoma with complete regression were reported, we could not find any case of stage IV high-grade malignant lymphoma with HAART alone in complete remission for over 5 years from our review of the literature. This unique case shows the importance of HAART in improving survival and achieving cure in HIV-high-grade malignant lymphoma."
7400,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly reduced mortality, and prolonged life expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. Such improvements have led to increasing numbers of HIV-infected patients with end-stage organ disease as potential candidates for transplantation. A HAART regimen usually consists of a combination of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), and/or protease inhibitors (PI). PI are known to strongly inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzyme system that is responsible for the metabolism of immunosuppressive drugs, such as tacrolimus, sirolimus, and cyclosporine. Besides these pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions, potential pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions may also occur with concomitant HAART and antimetabolites, such as mycophenolate mofetil. An approach to immunosuppressive management in HIV-infected organ transplant recipients requires attention to such complexities as unique drug-drug interactions and increased drug-related toxicities."

This paper describes the development of a pilot program in which a combined motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy intervention was used to increase adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and reduce substance use in HIV-infected adults. The main goals of the pilot study were (1) to confirm the ability to recruit HIV-positive substance users taking HAART; (2) to demonstrate the ability to retain participants over the course of an eight-session intervention; and (3) to examine changes in substance use and HAART adherence from pretreatment to posttreatment. Twelve HIV-positive adults with a substance use disorder participated in an 8-week intervention, which consisted of weekly individual sessions with a trained therapist. Results showed that despite the small sample size, there was a significant reduction in substance use from pretreatment to posttreatment. No statistically significant differences were found for changes in HIV medication adherence, but the trends suggest the potential for positive results with a larger sample. Retention for all eight sessions of the treatment was 73.3%. Eighty percent completed the 3-month follow-up assessment. Participants reported high therapeutic alliance reflecting comfort with their therapists and in the treatment. Overall, the pilot demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the treatment. Furthermore, results suggest that this may, in fact, be an effective intervention to reduce substance use and improve HIV medication adherence."
8122,0.005,1.0000,"This research describes major stressors in the lives of women who have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Thirty-one HIV antibody positive (HIV+) women infected primarily through heterosexual contact participated in a two hour semi-structured interview detailing the circumstances, context, and consequences of all stressful life events and difficulties experienced within the preceding six months. Qualitative methods of data analyses were utilized (Miles & Huberman, 1984). HIV-related life events and difficulties were classified into primary and secondary stressors based on the stress process model (Pearlin et al., 1981). Problems arising directly from one's seropositivity were defined as primary stressors. Stressful life events and difficulties occurring in other role areas were defined as secondary stressors. Six categories of HIV-related stressors were identified and quantified. Primary stressors were health-related, and included both gynecological problems (e.g., amenorrhea) and general symptoms of HIV infection (e.g., fatigue). Secondary stressors related to child and family (e.g., future guardianship of children), marital/partner relations (e.g., disclosure of HIV+ status), occupation (e.g., arranging time-off for medical appointments), economic problems (e.g., insurance ""hassles""), and social network events (e.g., death of friends from AIDS). This research indicates that HIV-positive women are exposed to multiple stressors; some may be viewed as unique to women, whereas others may be considered common to both sexes. Identification of stressors has implications for the design of medical and psychiatric interventions for women."
418,0.005,1.0000,"Since there are more than 150 000 Italians (about 25 for every 10,000 inhabitants) infected with HIV, Intensive Care Units (ICU) often come across patients who are HIV positive. The aim of this study was to provide current information on the epidemiology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients admitted to ICU during the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and to review issues related to the administration of antiretroviral therapy relevant to the ICU staff. Overall mortality of critically ill HIV-infected patients in ICUs has decreased in the HAART era, and patients are more often admitted with non-HIV-related illnesses. Use of HAART in the ICU is difficult; however it may be associated with improved outcomes. More HIV-infected patients survive ICU admission and are less likely to be admitted to the ICU for related infections; in most cases, they need critical care for problems unrelated to HIV infection or for conditions related to HAART toxicity. ICU staff need to be familiar with HAART for the following reasons: 1) to recognize life-threatening toxicities unique to these drugs; 2) to avoid drug interactions, which are extremely common and potentially life-threatening; and 3) to avoid enhancing HIV drug resistance, an occurrence that could have devastating consequences for the patient after discharge from the ICU."
7813,0.005,1.0000,"The reported positive rates of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) among Chinese blood donors generally do not include data from pre-donation rapid tests. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of serologic markers for HBsAg and risk factors among blood donors from Chengdu, China. From April 2010 to March 2011, a total of 16,875 blood donors were enrolled. Data from HBsAg tests before and after donations were collected to estimate the prevalence of HBsAg. A case-control study was conducted in 265 unique HBsAg-positive blood donors and 530 seronegative donors between January 2011 and October 2012. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using conditional logistic regression. The population attributable risk (PAR) was estimated. The prevalence of HBsAg was 3.17% (95%CI, 2.91-3.43%). The following risk factors were associated with HBV infection: non-vaccination for HBV (OR = 4.236; 95%CI, 2.72-6.60%), razor sharing (OR = 2.370; 95%CI, 1.46-3.84%), dental treatment (OR = 1.714; 95%CI, 1.21-2.43%), acupuncture (OR = 1.983; 95%CI, 1.20-3.28%), a family history of HBV infection (OR = 2.257; 95%CI, 1.32-3.86%), and endoscopy (OR = 2.17; 95%CI, 1.04-4.51%). The PAR values of the risk factors were 42.77%, 31.78%, 13.68%, 6.18%, 6.09%, and 2.85%, respectively, and the total PAR was 68.78%. The prevalence of HBsAg among Chinese blood donors is still high. HBV vaccinations can provide protection. Blood contact from sharing instruments is still a high risk route of transmission for HBV. Immunization programs and behavioral interventions should be used to prevent blood donation infections and improve blood safety."
2558,0.005,1.0000,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is implicated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related manifestations. Increased PAF synthesis has been recently detected in HIV-infected patients. In this study, we examined in naive HIV-infected patients the in vivo effects of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen, containing tenofovir-DF/emtricitabine/efavirenz, on PAF metabolism. The specific activities of PAF basic biosynthetic enzymes, PAF-cholinephosphotransferase (PAF-CPT) and lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase (lyso-PAF-AT), but also the ones of PAF-basic catabolic enzymes, PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) in leukocytes and platelets, and lipoprotein-associated-phospholipase-A(2) (LpPLA(2)) in plasma, were measured in blood samples of eight asymptomatic naive male HIV-infected patients just before and after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment. CD4 cell counts, viral load, and several biochemical markers were also measured in the same blood samples of these patients. The repeated measures ANOVA and the Pearson r criterion were used to study statistical differences and correlations-partial correlations, while linear mixed models were conducted in order to estimate association(s) between time-dependent changes in these factors. Before treatment, the activities of PAF-CPT in leukocytes and LpPLA(2) in plasma were found to be inversely correlated with CD4 cell counts and positively correlated with the viral load. After 6 months of treatment, the activities of basic PAF-biosynthetic enzymes, PAF-CPT and lyso-PAF-AT, were both reduced in leukocytes. At 6 months, PAF-AH activity was also reduced in these cells, while LpPLA(2) remained stable. The reduction of PAF-CPT occurred even from the first month, while there is a time-dependent correlation between the increase of CD4 and the decrease of both viral load and PAF-CPT of leukocytes during treatment. Apart from its classical antiretroviral activities the tenofovir-DF/emtricitabine/efavirenz regimen also exhibited favorable effects on PAF metabolism and therefore may also display beneficial effects in some HIV-related conditions, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), in which PAF is implicated."
1516,0.005,1.0000,"To achieve global targets for universal treatment set forth by the Joint United Nations Programme on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (UNAIDS), viral load monitoring for HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) must become the standard of care in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) (1). CDC and other U.S. government agencies, as part of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, are supporting multiple countries in sub-Saharan Africa to change from the use of CD4 cell counts for monitoring of clinical response to ART to the use of viral load monitoring, which is the standard of care in developed countries. Viral load monitoring is the preferred method for immunologic monitoring because it enables earlier and more accurate detection of treatment failure before immunologic decline. This report highlights the initial successes and challenges of viral load monitoring in seven countries that have chosen to scale up viral load testing as a national monitoring strategy for patients on ART in response to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Countries initiating viral load scale-up in 2014 observed increases in coverage after scale-up, and countries initiating in 2015 are anticipating similar trends. However, in six of the seven countries, viral load testing coverage in 2015 remained below target levels. Inefficient specimen transport, need for training, delays in procurement and distribution, and limited financial resources to support scale-up hindered progress. Country commitment and effective partnerships are essential to address the financial, operational, technical, and policy challenges of the rising demand for viral load monitoring. "
5568,0.005,1.0000,"Initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with low CD4 counts or AIDS-defining illnesses (ADIs) increases risk of treatment failure and death. We examined factors associated with late initiation among 18- to 29-year-olds within the Canadian Observational Cohort (CANOC) collaboration, a multi-site study of HIV-positive persons who initiated HAART after 2000. Late initiation was defined as beginning HAART with a CD4 count <200 cells/mm(3) and/or having a baseline ADI. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent correlates of late initiation. In total, 1026 individuals (422 from British Columbia, 400 from Ontario, and 204 from Quebec) met our age criteria. At HAART initiation, median age was 27 years (interquartile range, 24, 28 years). A total of 412 individuals (40%) identified as late initiators. Late initiation was associated with female gender, age >25 years at initiation, initiating treatment in earlier years, and having higher baseline viral load. The high number of young adults in our cohort starting HAART late indicates important target populations for specialized services, increased testing, and linkages to care. "
6855,0.005,1.0000,"We reviewed the 22 cases of Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI) infection that occurred among 196 human immunodeficiency virus-infected children seen at the National Cancer Institute Pediatric Branch from December 1986 through April 1991, and an additional 65 charts from children with cultures negative for MAI. All patients with proven MAI were receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, dideoxyinosine, or a combination of zidovudine and dideoxycytidine. All patients had disseminated MAI infection, except one adolescent who had only evidence of localized lymphadenitis. All cases of MAI but one were diagnosed before death. The overall incidence of MAI was 11% in our patients but increased to 24% in patients whose absolute CD4 cell counts were < 100 cells/mm3. Symptoms most commonly associated with MAI infection included recurrent fever (86% of patients), weight loss or failure to thrive (64%), neutropenia (55%), night sweats (32%), and abdominal pain (27%). Children infected with MAI had a mean CD4 percentage of 2% (range, 0% to 7%) and a mean absolute CD4 count of 12 cells/mm3 (range, 0 to 48 cells/mm3), significantly lower than in the remainder of the clinic population or the group of children with cultures negative for MAI. Of 20 patients with MAI infection who were tested, 10 had measurable p24 antigen with a mean value 939 pg/ml (range, 77 to 3270 pg/ml) compared with 19 of 59 patients without MAI infection in whom the mean positive value was 413 pg/ml. There was no difference in survival time between those children with documented MAI infection (median survival time, 45.5 weeks) and those with similarly low CD4 counts and cultures negative for MAI (median survival time, 50.4 weeks). Future improvements in therapeutic options may make screening of pediatric human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with low CD4 counts a reasonable plan."

HIV-HBV coinfected patients who were treatment naïve and initiating HBV-active HAART were recruited as part of a prospective cohort study in Thailand and followed for 48 weeks (n = 24). Production of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in both HBV- and HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells was quantified using intracellular cytokine staining on whole blood. Following HBV-active HAART, the median (interquartile range) log decline from week 0 to week 48 for HBV DNA was 5.8 log (range, 3.4 to 6.7) IU/ml, and for HIV RNA it was 3.1 (range, 2.9 to 3.5) log copies/ml (P < 0.001 for both). The frequency of HIV Gag-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses significantly decreased (IFN-gamma, P < 0.001; TNF-alpha, P = 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant change in the frequency (IFN-gamma, P = 0.21; TNF-alpha, P = 0.61; and IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, P = 0.11) or magnitude (IFN-gamma, P = 0.13; TNF-alpha, P = 0.13; and IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, P = 0.13) of HBV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses over 48 weeks of HBV-active HAART. Of the 14 individuals who were HBV e antigen (HBeAg) positive, 5/14 (36%) lost HBeAg during the 48 weeks of follow-up. HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected in 4/5 (80%) of patients prior to HBeAg loss. Results from this study show no sustained change in the HBV-specific CD8(+) T-cell response following HBV-active HAART. These findings may have implications for the duration of treatment of HBV in HIV-HBV coinfected patients, particularly in HBeAg-positive disease."
7994,0.005,1.0000,"To study the effect of concurrent use of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) on metabolic syndrome (MetS) components conferring increased cardiovascular risk in a sample of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). A retrospective study of participants consecutively recruited at the UCSD HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program examined effects of combined ART and SGAs on body mass index (BMI), nonfasting serum lipids, diabetes mellitus (DM) incidence, and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Metabolic outcome variables and covariates were compared using t-tests, Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests. Linear and logistic multivariable models explored metabolic outcomes for participants taking (SGA+) or not taking (SGA-) concomitant SGAs, after controlling for demographic and HIV disease- and ART-related covariates. Of 2229 HIV-infected participants, 12% (N=258) were treated with SGAs. In multivariable models adjusted for relevant covariates, the SGA+ group had significantly higher mean triglycerides, significantly higher odds of DM, significantly higher MAPs and marginally higher BMI. The use of SGAs in HIV-infected adults taking ART was independently associated with worse indicators of MetS and cardiovascular risk. Aggressive monitoring for the metabolic complications from concurrent SGA and ART is indicated in all patients receiving these medication combinations. "
3550,0.005,1.0000,"Reduced bone mass measurements are often found in HIV-infected youths. Both in vitro and human studies demonstrated a role of antiretroviral treatment in determining bone mass alteration. Nevertheless, the data regarding the responsibility of different antiretroviral drugs on bone health in children and adolescents are highly controversial. The purpose of the current study was to relate antiretroviral treatment to bone mass measurements in a large cohort of HIV-infected children and adolescents. Bone mineral content (BMC) was measured in 86 HIV-infected youths (aged 4.8-22.1 years), and in 194 healthy controls (aged 4.9-21.9 years). Fifteen patients were naive to antiretroviral treatment, 11 were receiving a dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTIs) combination, 32 a protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral treatment, and 28 a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTIs)-based regimen. Comparisons between healthy and HIV-infected children and adolescents have been performed by multiple regression analyses to correct for differences in age, sex, and anthropometric measurements. Patients receiving a PI-based treatment had lumbar spine and whole body BMC values significantly lower than healthy children (P<0.05). BMC measurements of patients on other therapeutic regimens or naive to antiretroviral treatment did not differ significantly from those of healthy children. Among patients receiving a PI-based regimen, those receiving full dose Ritonavir had significantly lower lumbar spine BMC values compared to other patients. Lumbar spine and whole body BMC measurements of patients receiving a Stavudine-containing regimen were lower compared to healthy controls, naive patients, and patients on other antiretroviral regimens. Multivariate analyses showed that patients receiving both Stavudine and full dose Ritonavir had significantly lower BMC values both at the lumbar spine (P=0.0033), and in the whole skeleton (P=0.05). In conclusion, antiretroviral treatment may have a detrimental effect on bone health of HIV-infected youths: the use of Ritonavir full dose alone or in combination with Stavudine is associated to lower bone mass measurements. The use of antiretroviral regimens including these drugs should thus be monitored closely in HIV-infected youths."
8478,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of sociodemographic characteristics, patient perceptions, and patient characteristics including spirituality, self-reported adherence, and highly active antiretroviral therapy. The convenience sample consisted of 120 English-speaking adults (60% male, 35% female, 5% transgendered) with HIV/AIDS from two HIV service agencies in a large metropolitan city in the southeastern United States. The mean self-reported adherence was 83.1% (SD = 15.7%). Adherence was significantly correlated with perceived support and absence of barriers, strong intentions to adhere, perceived effectiveness of the medications, higher levels of perceived general health, fewer years of HIV disease, and fewer years on antiretroviral medications. Existential well-being (e.g., viewing life as positive and having meaning) was a weak significant correlate. Backward regression analysis was conducted to identify a parsimonious model of predictors of adherence. The final model included presence of support and absence of barriers, fewer years of HIV infection, no current alcohol use, perceived severity of HIV, existential well-being, and male gender. This model explained 19.4% of the variance in adherence (observed F[6, 100] = 5.6, p < .0001)."

To minimize the number of horizontal transmissions, we determined the prevalence of HBV genotypes among children in northern Thailand. From a survey of 1,231 schoolchildren in Chiang Mai during 1998 to 2000, 55 (4.5%) were found positive for HBsAg. Fifty-three HBsAg-positive samples were available for this study. These came from 28 girls (52.8%) and 25 boys (47.2%), age 5-16 years, with a mean age of 12.8 (+/-2.6) years. The laboratory method was based on a multiplex-PCR for the detection of 6 HBV genotypes (A-F). Among 53 HBsAg positive cases, 48 (90.6%) were genotype C, followed by 4 cases of genotype B (7.5%), and 1 case (1.9%) with mixed infection with genotypes B and C. The high prevalence of HBV genotype C follow by genotype B is similar to that found among blood donors in northern Thailand and the nationwide epidemiological survey conducted in 2004. Perinatal transmission may play an important role in the spread of the virus in this area, as in other Asian countries, where genotypes C and B are highly prevalent."

In untreated HIV-infected patients, serum levels of CCL19 and CCL21 showed a biphasic pattern during progression; a marked increase was followed by a decline in patients with advanced immunodeficiency. During highly active antiretroviral therapy, a decrease in CCL19/CCL21 levels was restricted to virologic responders. We suggest that dysregulation of CCR7 ligands may play an important role in progression of HIV infection."

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at positions -607(C/A) and -137(C/G) in the promoter region of the interleukin-18 (IL-18) gene and at position +874(T/A) of the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) gene are related to the expression of these cytokines. To examine whether IL-18 and IFN-gamma polymorphisms are associated with LS, these SNPs were genotyped in 88 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients presenting LS, 79 HIV-infected without LS, and 133 healthy controls. The -607A allele, -607AA genotype, and -137G/-607A and -137C/-607A haplotypes in the IL-18 gene were over-represented in HIV patients presenting LS. The -137G/-607C haplotype was associated with protection against LS. These results indicate that the -607(C/A) SNP is associated with LS development in HIV-infected patients."
2639,0.005,1.0000,"Increasing interest has been devoted to the role that monocyte-macrophages play in the pathogenesis of AIDS. The hypothesis of an involvement in AIDS pathogenesis of human/simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV/SIV) Nef also is currently under evaluation by many investigators. The original basis of this hypothesis came from evidence that monkeys infected with a nef-deleted SIV strain failed to develop simian AIDS. Here, we show that treatment of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) with recombinant HIV-1 Nef protein (rNef) induces a strong inhibition of the replication of either macrophage (M-) or dual-tropic HIV-1 strains. Through cytofluorimetric analyses, we detected internalization of FITC-conjugated rNef in MDM as early as 6 h after treatment. Confocal microscope observations demonstrated that the intracellular distribution of internalized rNef was identical to that of endogenously produced Nef. Down-regulation of the CD4 HIV receptor detected upon rNef treatment of MDM suggested that the rNef-induced HIV inhibition occurred at the virus entry step. This deduction was strengthened by the observation that CD4-independent infection was totally insensitive to rNef treatment. The specificity of all observed effects was demonstrated by immunodepletion of rNef. Finally, we showed that the resistance to HIV replication induced by rNef treatment in MDM favours the spread of T-tropic over M-tropic HIV strains in doubly infected CD4(+) lymphocyte-MDM co-cultures. We propose that extracellular Nef contributes to AIDS pathogenesis by inducing resistance to M-tropic HIV replication in MDM, thereby facilitating the switching from M- to T-tropic HIV prevalence that correlates frequently with AIDS progression."

3057,0.005,1.0000,"The woodchuck together with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) is an excellent model to study the pathogenesis of hepadnaviral infections. Chronic WHV infection causes severe liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma in woodchucks. The mechanism of viral clearance is not fully understood, interferons seem to play a major role in down-regulating viral replication prior to elimination of infected hepatocytes. We investigated on the pattern of cytokine and T-cell-marker expression in livers of woodchucks chronically infected with WHV. RNase-protection-assay (RPA) was used to determine mRNA of woodchuck specific genes (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-15, CD3, CD4, CD8). Serial liver biopsies were performed daily or weekly in eight chronic WHV-carrier woodchucks. Cytokine/T-cell-marker expression differed significantly between the time points up to +/-50% within each woodchuck. The different expression patterns of cytokines or T-cell-markers did not correlate to the (weak) fluctuations in the viremia but may explain the observed fluctuations in the WHV/HBV-load in chronically infected individuals. Furthermore, we observed associations between cytokine and T-cell-marker expression. The marginal fluctuations in viremia during the chronic infection may indicate, that, once the chronic hepadnaviral infection is established, cytokines/interferons expressed endogenously (i.e. not vector-borne or injected) play only a minor role."

Among 249 individuals who were HIV-infected and prospectively followed up over a 10-year period (1985 to 1995), 12 having a CD4+ T-cell count greater than 500/microL (LTNP I group) and 9 having a CD4+ T-cell count less than 500 but stable over time (LTNP II group) after at least 10 years of infection without intervention of antiviral therapy, were studied over the entire follow-up period. The plasma HIV RNA copy number and the serum concentrations of p24 antigen, each anti-HIV antibody, neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin, Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA were determined every 18 months over the study period. Cellular and plasma viremias were cross-sectionaly assayed in all 21 patients. Only two patients had strictly no marker of progression over the follow-up period. They were the only ones who had, over the 10-year period, a viral copy number too low to be detected. The other patients had a viral copy number higher than 400/mL at at least one visit and increasing over the follow-up period, and they evidenced one or more markers of virological or immunological deterioration. Cellular viremia was positive in all patients but two, while plasma viremia was negative in all but one. The population of individuals termed as LTNPs is not virologically and immunologically homogeneous. The majority present biological signs of HIV disease progression. A new pattern of true LTNP can be drawn through stringent criteria based on the whole known predictors. This pattern appears to be rare in HIV-positive population."

8165,0.005,1.0000,"Over the last few years, a relative decline of the morbidity and mortality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in industrialised countries has been observed due to the use of a potent combined therapy known as high active antiretroviral therapies (HAARTs). It has led to a decrease of viral load and a quantitative and qualitative improvement of immune function in patients, especially CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, having as a consequence a decrease of infectious complications and a global clinical improvement. Besides the positive effects of HAARTs on immune and metabolic alterations during HIV infection, it has been reported that the commonly used drugs AZT, ddI, and ddC are toxic to hepatocytes. Recent reports continue to point to the mitochondria as targets for toxicity. The prevalence of these symptoms is continued during acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The effects of oxidative stress occurring as a consequence of mitochondrial toxicity may amplify some of the pathophysiological and phenotypic events during infection. Mitochondrial stabilisation and antioxidative strategies are possible new therapeutic aims since the antiretroviral treatment is prolonged with increased longevity from AIDS, which has become a more manageable chronic illness. The aim of the present review article is to summarize the current knowledge about mitochondrial dysfunction during HAART and its consequence for patients with chronic treatment. Oxidative stress may serve as one pathway for cellular damage in AIDS and its treatment. One important future goal is to prevent or attenuate the side effects of HAART so that improved disease management can be achieved."

This substudy evaluated the emergence of nevirapine-resistance mutations at 6 weeks postpartum in a subgroup of participants. Maternal risk factors for the emergence of nevirapine-resistance mutations were evaluated. Mutations associated with nevirapine resistance were detectable at delivery, prior to receipt of study drug, in 5 (2.3%) of 217 women. Fourteen (15%; 95% confidence interval, 8%-23%) of 95 women who received intrapartum nevirapine developed a nevirapine-resistance mutation 6 weeks postpartum. The most common mutation was K103N, which was present in 10 women. The risk for development of a new nevirapine-resistance mutation did not correlate with CD4 cell count or HIV-1 RNA load at delivery or with type of antepartum antiretroviral therapy. The risk of nevirapine resistance should be considered when determining the risks or benefits of intrapartum nevirapine in women receiving antepartum antiretroviral therapy."

From a population-based household survey conducted between September and November 2012 in rural western Kenya, we retrospectively assessed HIV-1 TDR baseline rates, its determinants, and genetic diversity among drug-naïve persons aged 15-59 years with acute HIV-1 infections (AHI) and recent HIV-1 infections (RHI) as determined by nucleic acid amplification test and both Limiting Antigen and BioRad avidity immunoassays, respectively. HIV-1 pol sequences were scored for drug resistance mutations using Stanford HIVdb and WHO 2009 mutation guidelines. HIV-1 subtyping was computed in MEGA6. Eighty seven (93.5%) of the eligible samples were successfully sequenced. Of these, 8 had at least one TDR mutation, resulting in a TDR prevalence of 9.2% (95% CI 4.7-17.1). No TDR was observed among persons with AHI (n = 7). TDR prevalence was 4.6% (95% CI 1.8-11.2) for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 6.9% (95% CI 3.2-14.2) for non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and 1.2% (95% CI 0.2-6.2) for protease inhibitors. Three (3.4% 95% CI 0.8-10.1) persons had dual-class NRTI/NNRTI resistance. Predominant TDR mutations in the reverse transcriptase included K103N/S (4.6%) and M184V (2.3%); only M46I/L (1.1%) occurred in the protease. All the eight persons were predicted to have different grades of resistance to the ARV regimens, ranging from potential low-level to high-level resistance. HIV-1 subtype distribution was heterogeneous: A (57.5%), C (6.9%), D (21.8%), G (2.3%), and circulating recombinant forms (11.5%). Only low CD4 count was associated with TDR (p = 0.0145).

Overall, 28 (11.4%) of the 245 children acquired HCV infection. Transmission occurred in 3 of 80 children (3.7%) whose mothers had HCV infection alone and in 25 of 165 (15.1%; P < .01) whose mothers had concurrent infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The percentage of HIV-1-infected children was similar (22 of 165, 13.3%), but each virus was transmitted independently; only six infants (3.6%) were coinfected with HCV and HIV-1. The risk of HCV transmission was not associated with maternal HIV-1-related symptoms, intravenous drug use, prematurity, low birth weight, or breast-feeding, whereas it was lower with cesarean section than with vaginal delivery (5.6% vs. 13.9%, P = .06). This suggests that transmission occurs mainly around the time of delivery."

Scientific investigations and reports on lipid and glucose disorders among HIV infected communities are inadequate especially in those developing such as Malaysia. This cross-sectional survey was mainly aimed to evaluate the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities and associated risk factors among HIV infected population patients on ARV medication."
475,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to determine the virological response and the possible emergence of drug resistance at 1 and 2 years postpartum in HIV-positive pregnant women enrolled under the Option B approach and meeting the criteria for treatment. In the study, women with baseline CD4(+) <350/mm(3) received a combination of stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine during pregnancy (from week 25 of gestation) and continued it indefinitely after delivery. HIV-RNA was measured at 12 and 24 months postpartum. Drug resistance mutations were assessed in those with HIV-RNA >50 copies/ml. Baseline resistance mutations were assessed in the entire cohort. A total of 107 women were studied. At baseline, resistance mutations were seen in 6.6% of the women. At 12 months, 26.7% of the women had >50 copies/ml and among them 12.9% had virological failure (HIV-RNA >1,000 copies/ml). At 24 months, detectable HIV-RNA was seen in 28.3% of the women and virological failure in 10.1% of the women. Resistance mutations (mainly non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors mutations) were seen in 40% of the women with detectable HIV-RNA. Baseline mutations did not correlate with virological failure or the emergence of resistance at later time points. Virological failure 2 years postpartum and emergence of resistance were rare in this cohort of HIV-infected women. These findings are reassuring in the light of the new strategies for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, recommending life-long antiretroviral therapy administration."
4363,0.005,1.0000,"To determine when the precore mutation at the 83rd nucleotide occurs, leading to the formation of a stop codon in the hepatitis B virus genome in carriers, which would indicate the presence of antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), we investigated this mutation by direct sequencing and subcloning in 22 young hepatitis B antigen (HBeAg) (+) carriers. These subjects were 7-17 years old and were found during a survey for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in three elementary schools, a junior high, and a senior high school. None of these carriers had clinical manifestations, although one-third of them had elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels. All were HBeAg-positive by radioimmunoassay (RIA), and 6 of them had preserved titers of anti-HBe at the same time. Precore mutations were found in 4 subjects (18.2%), with predominance of the wild type. Although 3 of these 4 had preserved titers of HBeAb, the other had no HBeAb titers. In an other 3 subjects with preserved titers of HBeAb, the precore mutation was not detected, even after the subcloning of viral DNA. The remaining 15 subjects with HBeAg showed no precore mutation. Subjects with ALT levels exceeding 100 IU/l were all HBeAg-positive without the mutation. It was clear that the precore mutation itself occurred in the subjects at an early age during the course of infection. However, the chronological relationship between the emergence of the precore mutation and the onset of hepatitis requires further study."
3944,0.005,1.0000,"In recent years the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals has been based on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) comprising a combination of nucleoside analogues or the combination of these agents with protease inhibitors. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of oral lesions in a cohort of 103 HIV-seropositive patients on HAART, to compare these data with the prevalence of lesions prior to HAART and to correlate these finding with the immunologic data. A total of 103 HIV-seropositive patients on HAART were selected. Oral lesions associated with HIV infection and immunological parameters were registered. On re-examination 6 months after the first evaluation, 61/103 patients were available. Comparing the prevalence of oral lesions before and after the onset of HAART, the number of oral lesions was significantly lower (P=0.001). The number of CD4+ cells increased and the viral load decreased significantly after initiation of HAART (P=0.001 and P= 0.0001). On re-examination 6 months later, the prevalence of lesions again decreased significantly (P=0.001). The immunological benefits of HAART may prevent HIV-associated oral lesions in patients with advanced HIV disease. Our results showed that oral manifestations decrease on HAART, but in four patients the immunological effects of therapy did not provide sufficient protection against human papillomavirus (HPV)induced lesions."
4270,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus is a major health problem worldwide. The only established therapy is interferon-alpha, with an efficacy of only 30-40% in highly selected patients. Nucleoside analogues do not show a significant clinical benefit. Molecular therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking gene expression include antisense DNA/RNA and ribozymes acting at the posttranscriptional level and triple helix formation blocking at the transcriptional level. In vitro, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides inhibit viral replication and gene expression in human hepatoma cell lines. In vivo, an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide directed against the 5'-region of the pre-S gene of the duck hepatitis B virus inhibited viral replication and gene expression in ducks. In vitro, ribozymes accurately cleave HBV substrate RNA. Triple helix formation is another very promising molecular approach. Results in hepadnaviral infection are not yet available, however."
2074,0.005,1.0000,"In 1998 it seems reasonable and widely accepted that all human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients willing to be treated may benefit from receiving antiretroviral therapy. Only those with undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA, normal CD4 lymphocyte counts and lack of markers of immunological system activation may be possible exceptions. The rationale supporting the early initiation of antiretroviral therapy are (i) data on viral dynamics; (ii) preliminary data pointing toward a better and a quicker restoration of immune function when treatment is initiated in very early stages (during or within a few weeks or months of acute symptomatic or asymptomatic HIV-1 infection); (iii) the lack of a stable viral load set-point even in patients in the early stages (CD4 > 500 cells/mm3) who have a very low viral load (< 5000 copies/ml); (iv) the relatively high likelihood of clinical progression at mid-term of the approximately 50-75% of patients in very early disease stages (CD4 > 500 cells/mm3) who have a plasma viral load above 5000 to 10,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml; (v) data from the Spanish Earth-1 study, which used a composite endpoint (virological, immunological or clinical progression), demonstrating that even in these very early stages of HIV-1 disease any antiretroviral therapy (double or triple combination) was better than no treatment. Even in early disease stages, a triple combination is needed to achieve a durable and profound virological and immunological response. In addition, the combination of stavudine plus didanosine has several advantages and can be considered one of the best double nucleoside combinations to combine with a protease inhibitor or with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The INCAS study and the preliminary results of the ongoing Spanish SCAN study have demonstrated the possibility of protease inhibitor-sparing combinations for initial antiretroviral treatment, at least in selected patient subsets, such as those with a relatively low baseline viral load. Furthermore, components of these protease inhibitor-sparing combinations such as didanosine or nevirapine are suitable for once daily administration."

The only triphosphate found in cells incubated with 1592U89 was that of the guanine analog (-)-carbovir (CBV). However, the in vivo pharmacokinetic, distribution, and toxicological profiles of 1592U89 were distinct from and improved over those of CBV, probably because CBV itself was not appreciably formed from 1592U89 in cells or animals (<2%). The 5'-triphosphate of CBV was a potent, selective inhibitor of HIV-1 RT, with Ki values for DNA polymerases (alpha, beta, gamma, and epsilon which were 90-, 2,900-, 1,200-, and 1,900-fold greater, respectively, than for RT (Ki, 21 nM). 1592U89 was relatively nontoxic to human bone marrow progenitors erythroid burst-forming unit and granulocyte-macrophage CFU (IC50s, 110 microM) and human leukemic and liver tumor cell lines. 1592U89 had excellent oral bioavailability (105% in the rat) and penetrated the CNS (rat brain and monkey cerebrospinal fluid) as well as AZT. Having demonstrated an excellent preclinical profile, 1592U89 has progressed to clinical evaluation in HIV-infected patients."
6921,0.005,1.0000,"Because pancreatitis has been reported frequently in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection, we sought to determine the incidence of pancreatitis in children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome by reviewing all records of children with AIDS, their serum amylase and lipase levels, and the factors associated with pancreatitis through a case-control analysis. During a 6-year period pancreatitis developed in 9 (17%) of 53 pediatric patients with AIDS. Six children had vertical transmission of infection and three patients had acquired HIV infection through contaminated blood products. Pancreatitis developed at a median age of 5.2 years (range 1.2 to 20 years). All patients had vomiting and abdominal pain. When the patients were first seen, lipase values were elevated more than amylase values (p = 0.028). Amylase and lipase levels declined at comparable rates. In the case-control analysis, pentamidine isethionate was significantly associated with pancreatitis (p = 0.02); the risk was greater in patients who received pentamidine isethionate and had absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/mm3 (p = 0.001). Infections associated with the onset of pancreatitis included cytomegalovirus (4), Cryptosporidium (1), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (3), and Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (1). Coinfection with cytomegalovirus was associated with a protracted course in four children. Ultrasonographic examination demonstrated biliary ductal dilatation 6 months after the onset of pancreatitis in one child. Seven children have died at a mean of 8 months after the initial onset of pancreatitis; the one living child has survived 5 months from the onset of pancreatitis. We conclude that pancreatitis is common in pediatric patients with AIDS and may be related to pentamidine isethionate exposure, especially when absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts are less than 100 cells/mm3. Serum amylase levels do not always accurately predict the onset of pancreatitis; serum lipase levels should be measured in children with symptoms. The onset of pancreatitis in an HIV-infected child is a poor prognostic indicator."

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of occult HBV infection and its clinical and virological features in the community of Solomon Islands. Blood samples were collected from a total of 564 asymptomatic individuals aged over 18 years in the Western province. The samples used in the present study consisted of 200 samples from 108 males and 92 females (mean age, 37.4 years; range, 18-71 years) that were randomly selected among the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative samples from all the participants enrolled in this study. HBV-DNA was detected by real-time PCR in 25 (12.5%) of the 200 HBsAg-negative samples. Most of the HBV-DNA-positive individuals were infected with wild-type HBV, and only 3 strains demonstrated specific amino acid substitutions (P121X, T123N, C138S, P142S and D144E) in the α determinant region. In conclusion, occult HBV infection was documented in 12.5% of individuals that demonstrated serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection in this study. The prevalence of occult infection was also influenced by ethnicity; it was more prevalent in Melanesians than Micronesians. In addition, occult HBV infection demonstrated a weak association with the S-variants."
8454,0.005,1.0000,"Lopinavir (LPV)-ritonavir has demonstrated durable antiviral activity in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected antiretroviral-naïve and protease inhibitor (PI)-experienced patients. However, information on LPV activity against HIV-2 and the patterns of mutations in HIV-2 in response to selection by LPV is limited. The activity of LPV against three strains of HIV-2 was assessed and compared to activity against a reference HIV-1 strain. LPV demonstrated activity similar to that observed against HIV-1 in two HIV-2 strains (HIV-2(MS) and HIV-2(CBL-23)) tested. On the other hand, approximately 10-fold-reduced susceptibility was observed with the third HIV-2 strain, HIV-2(CDC310319). Passage of HIV-2(MS) with increasing concentrations of LPV selected mutations V47A and D17N in the HIV-2 protease gene. The introduction of both 17N and 47A either individually or together into HIV-2(ROD) molecular infectious clones showed that the single V47A substitution in HIV-2 resulted in a substantial reduction in susceptibility to LPV. In contrast, this mutant retained wild-type susceptibility to other PIs and appeared to be hypersusceptible to atazanavir and saquinavir."

We have studied ten subjects who have been asymptomatic with normal and stable CD4+ lymphocyte counts, despite 12 to 16 years of HIV-1 infection, to gain information on the determinants of nonprogression. Multiple methods were used to determine the viral load in their blood. Plasma cultures were uniformly negative for infectious virus. However, particle-associated HIV-1 RNA was detectable in four subjects using a sensitive branched DNA amplification assay. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), infectious HIV-1 was quantified in three subjects using a standard limiting-dilution culture method. Infectious virus was recovered from another subject using a CD8-depleted culture. In contrast, six subjects had no detectable infectious virus in PBMC. All had detectable viral DNA in PBMC by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay, but the copy numbers were low, ranging from 10 to 100 copies per 10(6) PBMC in all but two subjects. Overall, the viral burden in the plasma and PBMC of long-term survivors was orders of magnitude lower than those typically found in progressors. Possible mechanisms for low levels of HIV-1 in vivo were examined experimentally."

Using an immunohistochemical approach, we studied the expression of HBx in 39 explanted livers with HBV-associated disease. Because the data reported previously have been inconsistent, possibly due to the application of different antibodies, we compared results with 5 polyclonal and 6 monoclonal anti-HBx antibodies from five laboratories. Ten of the 11 antibodies reacted with recombinant HBx by Western blotting, but only 1 polyclonal and 2 monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with HBx in tissue, and were thus suitable for immunohistochemistry. Three other polyclonal antibodies reacted with tissue components in addition to HBx. One polyclonal and 4 monoclonal antibodies did not recognize the HBx in the tissue. HBx was demonstrated in 16 of 30 (53.3%) cirrhotic livers and 10 of 18 (58.8%) HCCs by all specific antibodies. The expression of HBx, among three HBV antigens examined, was found to be preferentially maintained in HCC and the surrounding liver parenchyma, including focal or nodular preneoplastic lesions. However, the immunoreactivity was always limited to the cytoplasm of a small number of parenchymal and neoplastic cells. The role of X gene expression in HBV-associated human hepatocarcinogenesis remains to be established."

This study was designed to determine the effect of alcohol dependence on virus replication and CD4 profiles in simian immunodeficiency virus/simian-HIV-infected rhesus macaques. A group of 3 male Indian rhesus macaques was adapted to a self-drinking model of alcohol consumption, whereas another group of 3 macaques was provided a Nutrasweet solution. After 7 weeks of alcohol consumption, the alcohol-dependent animals along with controls were intravenously inoculated with a mixture of SHIV(KU), SHIV(89.6)P, and SIV/17E-Fr. These animals were followed for a period of 24 weeks for complete blood cell counts, CD4 cell profiles, and viral loads in the blood and cerebral compartments. The alcohol and control groups showed comparable peak viral loads in the blood. The plasma viral load in the alcohol group was 31- to 85-fold higher than that in the control group at weeks 18 through 24 after infection, however. The pattern of cerebrospinal fluid viral replication was also comparable during the acute phase; however, the virus continued to replicate in the brain of alcohol-dependent animals, whereas it became undetectable in the controls. The extent of CD4 cell loss in the alcohol group was significantly higher than that in the control animals at week 1 after infection."

In the individual host, the two pathogens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV, potentiate one another, accelerating the deterioration of immunological functions. In high-burden settings, HIV coinfection is the most important risk factor for developing active TB, which increases the susceptibility to primary infection or reinfection and also the risk of TB reactivation for patients with latent TB. M. tuberculosis infection also has a negative impact on the immune response to HIV, accelerating the progression from HIV infection to AIDS. The clinical management of HIV-associated TB includes the integration of effective anti-TB treatment, use of concurrent antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevention of HIV-related comorbidities, management of drug cytotoxicity, and prevention/treatment of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

Five main barriers (forgetfulness, social/physical environment, complexity of the regimens, medication side effects, and inadequate patient knowledge) to adherence and six main facilitators (mechanical devices, ""making a commitment,"" ""routinizing,"" health beliefs, social support, and professional support) emerged from the data.

3644,0.005,1.0000,"Integration of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome into the host chromosome is a vital step in the HIV life cycle. The highly conserved cytosine-adenine (CA) dinucleotide sequence immediately upstream of the cleavage site is crucial for integrase (IN) activity. As this viral enzyme has an important role early in the HIV-1 replication cycle, interference with the IN substrate has become an attractive strategy for therapeutic intervention. We demonstrated that a designed zinc finger protein (ZFP) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) targets the 2-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) circle junctions of HIV-1 DNA with nanomolar affinity. We report now that 2LTRZFP-GFP stably transduced into 293T cells interfered with the expression of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped lentiviral red fluorescent protein (RFP), as shown by the suppression of RFP expression. We also used a third-generation lentiviral vector and pCEP4 expression vector to deliver the 2LTRZFP-GFP transgene into human T-lymphocytic cells, and a stable cell line for long-term expression studies was selected for HIV-1 challenge. HIV-1 integration and replication were inhibited as measured by Alu-gag real-time PCR and p24 antigen assay. In addition, the molecular activity of 2LTRZFP-GFP was evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The results were confirmed by Alu-gag real-time PCR for integration interference. We suggest that the expression of 2LTRZFP-GFP limited viral integration on intracellular immunization, and that it has potential for use in HIV gene therapy in the future."

Therefore, it seems evident that the replicative capacity of the virus is largely related to viral entry. In this study we have used growth competition experiments and TaqMan real-time PCR detection to measure the fitness of subtype B HIV-1 primary isolates and autologous env-recombinant viruses in order to analyze the contribution of wild-type env sequences to overall HIV-1 fitness. A significant correlation was observed between fitness values obtained for wild-type HIV-1 isolates and those for the corresponding env-recombinant viruses (r = 0.93; P = 0.002). Our results suggest that the env gene, which is linked to a myriad of viral characteristics (e.g., entry into the host cell, transmission, coreceptor usage, and tropism), plays a major role in fitness of wild-type HIV-1. In addition, this new recombinant assay may be useful for measuring the contribution of HIV-1 env to fitness in viruses resistant to novel antiretroviral entry inhibitors."

There are only limited studies on HBV genotype distribution in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), all done in the western part showing a vast majority of genotype E. In our study, HBV strains from South Kivu, an eastern province of the DRC, were analyzed. Sequencing of 41 serum samples from HBV infected patients revealed strains of genotype A in 40/41 (97.6%) and genotype E in 1/41 (2.4%). The phylogenetic analysis showed that nearly all genotypes A (38/40) were closely related to A1 subgenotype strains found in Rwanda, Haiti, and Martinique while only two strains attached to the A2 subgenotype cluster were isolated. The remaining genotype E case was linked to the western African E crescent. Only the I169T nucleotide substitution was observed in two genotype A samples. In conclusion, the genotype A seems to be the most predominant genotype in eastern DRC with the majority belonging to the Afro-Asian subgenotype (A1). This contrasts with the western part of DRC where genotype E is predominant. These results support the hypothesis of an East-West genotypic demarcation."

The crude odds ratio for HIV infection was 8.6 (95 % CI 2.2-73). After adjustment for possible confounders in a multivariate regression model, the odds ratio for HIV infection in children with TB was found to be 12.7 (95% CI 2.9-55).

This study was performed to correlate treatment outcome with the resistance patterns in HIV-seropositive patients coinfected with pulmonary TB. Sputum specimens were collected from 1643 HIV-seropositive patients and subjected to microscopy and liquid culture for TB. The smear- and culture-positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were subjected to Genotype MTBDRplus assay version 2.0. The M. tuberculosis culture-positivity rate was 39.44% (648/1643) among the 1643 HIV-seropositive patients and the overall MDR-TB rate was 5.6% (36/648). There were 421 newly diagnosed and 227 previously treated patients, among whom, MDR-TB was associated with 2.9% and 10.57% cases, respectively. The rate of rifampicin monoresistant TB among the cases of MDR-TB was 2.31% (15/648) and the rate of combined rifampicin and isoniazid resistance was 3.24% (21/648). The cure and death rates among the 20 registered cases were 30% (6/20) and 35% (7/20), respectively. Five cases were on treatment and two cases were defaulters among the 20 registered cases. High death rate (13, 36.1%, 95% confidence interval 20.8-53.8) was observed in this study among the patients who had mutations at the 530-533 codons.

5222,0.005,1.0000,"There are limited data on the efficacy of T cell-based assays to detect tuberculosis (TB) antigen-specific responses in immune-deficient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in patients with HIV-1 infection, especially in those with advanced disease (CD4 T cell count < 300 cells/microl). An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, which detects interferon (IFN)-gamma secreted by T cells exposed to TB antigens, was used to assess specific immune responses in a prospective study of 201 HIV-1-infected patients with risk factors for TB infection, attending a single HIV unit. The performance of the ELISPOT assay to detect TB antigen-specific immune responses is independent of CD4 T cell counts in HIV-1 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis does not differ significantly from values obtained in immunocompetent subjects. The negative predictive value of the TB ELISPOT test is 98.2%. A positive predictive value of 86% for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis was found when the combined number of early secretory antigen target-6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein-10 (CFP-10) IFN-gamma spots to CD4 T cell count ratio was > 1.5. TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in HIV patients with low CD4 T cell counts using ELISPOT technology in a routine diagnostic laboratory and is a useful test to exclude TB infection in immune-deficient HIV-1 patients. A combination of TB antigen-specific IFN-gamma responses and CD4 T cell counts has the potential to distinguish active tuberculosis from latent infection."
1047,0.005,1.0000,"In 1995, an outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) occurred among residents of a correctional-facility housing unit for inmates infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We isolated and treated patients who were suspected to have TB. To determine risk factors for in-prison transmission of TB, we conducted a case-control study to compare inmate case patients infected with a distinct outbreak strain of TB with control subjects who resided in the HIV unit. We identified 15 case patients during a 4-month period. Among inmates with a CD4 count of <100 cells/mm(3), case patients were more likely than control subjects to spend >/=20 hours per week in a communal day room (odds ratio, 42; P=.002) and were less likely to have a television in their single-person room (odds ratio, 0.10; P=.003). The communal day room was a likely site of transmission. Successful collaboration between the correctional system and public health departments halted the outbreak."
3086,0.005,1.0000,"To explore demographics, clinical and medication profiles, patients' social support, and perceived health status in HIV/TB coinfected patients in Guangxi, China.We performed a cross-sectional study in the HIV clinic of the Guigang City People's Hospital (N = 150). Health professionals conducted face-to-face interviews and collected data from patients' electronic medical records regarding patients' demographic, clinical, and medication information, as well as their social support and perceived health status. We classified all HIV/AIDS patients into HIV monoinfected and TB coinfected, at a ratio of 2:1.Compared with the HIV monoinfected, patients with HIV/TB coinfection were more likely to be older, male, less educated, unemployed, carrying health insurance, having advanced stage of HIV infection, longer history with HIV, and other opportunistic infections. Patients coinfected with TB were also more likely to hold a negative belief that their HIV treatment could prevent exacerbations, and reported significantly worse emotional/informational support, social interaction, and perceived health status. Better social support and better self-efficacy to the HIV treatment adherence was significantly associated with better perceived health status among patients with HIV and TB coinfection.Having HIV/TB coinfection was associated with poorer perceived general well-being and mental health, particularly in those undergoing TB therapy. Our findings suggest the need for mental health referrals and medication management for coinfected individuals, as well as further efforts and policies to improve coordinated care."
9007,0.005,1.0000,"We hypothesized that rapid presentation may be a general feature of tuberculosis (TB) associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that limits the impact of HIV on the point prevalence of TB. To investigate this, we performed a cross-sectional HIV and TB disease survey with retrospective and prospective follow-up. HIV prevalence among 1,773 systematically recruited miners was 27%. TB incidence was much more strongly HIV associated (incidence rate ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-8.6) than the point prevalence of undiagnosed TB disease (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9-3.3). For smear-positive TB, 7 of 9 (78%) prevalent cases were HIV negative, and point prevalence was nonsignificantly lower in miners who were HIV positive (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1-4.2). The calculated mean duration of smear positivity before diagnosis (point prevalence/incidence) was substantially shorter for HIV-positive than HIV-negative TB patients (0.17 and 1.15 years, respectively; ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.00-0.73). HIV has considerably less impact on the point prevalence of TB disease than on TB incidence, probably because rapid disease progression increases presentation and case-finding rates. The difference in mean duration of smear positivity was particularly marked and, if generalizable, will have major implications for TB control prospects in high HIV prevalence areas."
7023,0.005,1.0000,"At least one-third of the 34 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide are infected with latent tuberculosis (TB). The aim of this study was to determine the rate of HIV infection in TB patients and its determinants in Wuxi City, China. TB patients attending health institutions (12 selected sites) for TB diagnosis and treatment were enrolled in this study. TB diagnosis, treatment and HIV testing were done according to the national guidelines. Blood samples were collected for anonymous HIV testing. Among the TB patients, the HIV prevalence was 13.66% (1493/10,926). Multivariate analysis showed that gender, age, education, marital status, per capita monthly income, patient residence, family size, distance from a health institution, knowledge of HIV-TB co-infection, and knowledge of HIV may be risk factors for HIV-TB co-infection (all: odds ratio > 1, p < 0.05). The prevalence of TB in those with HIV was higher among the study participants. Improving public awareness of HIV-TB co-infection, regularly screening and improving follow-up can reduce the occurrence of HIV-TB co-infection."
1286,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) introduced in association with the luciferase reporter gene into Jurkat T cells was strongly activated by a combination of human neutrophils and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Activation was not observed when normal neutrophils were replaced by neutrophils which lack a respiratory burst, ie, from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), was strongly inhibited by catalase, was potentiated by vanadate, was stimulated by relatively low concentrations of azide, and was inhibited by selective inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC). The PMA affected activation in three ways: (1) by directly activating the LTR in Jurkat LTRluc; (2) by inducing a respiratory burst in neutrophils with the formation of H2O2; and (3) by increasing the sensitivity of Jurkat LTRluc to the activating effect of H2O2. When PMA was replaced by opsonized zymosan as the neutrophil stimulus, activation of the LTR was low unless azide was added. Activation in the presence of azide was not seen when CGD neutrophils were used or when catalase was added, suggesting that azide acts by inhibiting the degradation of H2O2. These findings indicate that activation of the HIV-1 LTR in Jurkat T cells can be induced by H2O2 released by neutrophils, particularly when PKC is concomitantly activated."
6482,0.005,1.0000,"We have studied the effects of human wild-type and mutant p53s on the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV). HeLa cells were cotransfected with a wild-type or mutant p53 expression plasmid and a plasmid containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene under HIV LTR promoter control. As expected, expression of wild-type p53 inhibited promoter function. Expression of a p53 mutated at any one of the four amino acid positions 175, 248, 273, and 281 correlated with a significant increase of the HIV promoter activity. The HIV LTR was also significantly activated in Saos-2 cells that do not express endogenous p53. This finding suggests a gain-of-transactivation function by mutation of the p53 gene. Cotransfection of wild-type and mutant p53-281G expression plasmids indicated that either the wild type or the mutant was dominant in inhibiting or enhancing promoter activity, respectively, when transfected in excess of the other. Transfection experiments showed transactivation even when the Sp1, NF-kappa B, and TATA sites in the LTR were individually mutated. Synthetic minimal promoter constructs containing two Sp1 sites or two NF-kappa B sites or an ATF site are also significantly activated by the mutant p53-281G. Thus, the mutant protein may activate transcription through interaction with either a general transcription factor or a common factor that bridges the basal transcription machinery and the transcription factors Sp1, NF-kappa B, and ATF."
3619,0.005,1.0000,"Transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 long terminal repeat (HIV-2 LTR) responds to T-cell antigen receptor signaling. Agents that stimulate T-cell signaling pathways activated by the antigen receptor, such as phorbol ester, plant lectin, or anti-CD3 antibody treatment, have been shown to increase transcription directed by the HIV-2 LTR. In this study, we examine the activation of the HIV-2 LTR in T cells stimulated with the physiologic ligand of the T-cell receptor, antigenic peptide presented by a major histocompatibility molecule. HIV-2 reporter plasmids were transfected into the antigen-specific T-cell hybridoma, 2B4.11, where they responded to antigen-dependent activation. This antigen-mediated transcriptional activation of the HIV-2 enhancer required the presence of at least four regulatory elements in the HIV-2 enhancer, including two purine boxes, PuB1 and PuB2, an AP-1/CREB-like element (pets), and kappa B. This finding suggests that signals emanating from the antigen receptor act coordinately on a set of transcription factors that bind to conserved HIV-2 regulatory elements. Despite differences in the organization of potentially related enhancer elements in HIV-2 and IL-2, these enhancers exploit a similar signal transduction pathway to induce gene expression in antigen-activated T cells."
2463,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C is found in approximately a third of patients infected with HIV. Therapy of hepatitis C in HIV patients is very important from several view points. First, hepatitis C in the setting of immunosuppression may progress faster, although recent data show that mortality from liver disease was decreased in highly active antiretroviral therapy. HIV/hepatitis C coinfection is associated with more frequent elevation in liver tests (drug-induced liver injury) during highly active antiretroviral therapy, and in some studies, hepatitis C has been associated with lower CD4+ recoveries. The therapeutic standard of care is a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin at a fixed dose, 800 mg/day, although higher ribavirin doses may further improve virologic outcomes. In patients that do not respond virologically, maintenance therapy with peginterferon monotherapy is a potential avenue to stem the advance of liver fibrosis, although controlled data in coinfected patients are needed to issue formal recommendations."

1792,0.005,1.0000,"Interactions between combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and lung cancer treatment are emerging clinical concerns. Among the reasons for that, one can observe the longer survival of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients since introduction of CART and the epidemiologic rising of lung cancer, mainly adenocarcinomas, in this population. In addition, the higher relative risk of lung cancer in HIV-infected patients compared with general population has been recently demonstrated. Patients' demography and disease characteristics differ from the general lung cancer population, although most cases occur in patients with a smoking history: HIV-infected subjects are generally younger and diagnosis frequently made at locally advanced or metastatic stages. The choice of cytotoxic chemotherapy and antiretroviral therapy is essential in the context of lung cancer (1) to minimize potential interactions and life-threatening toxicities particularly through cytochrome P450 interaction, (2) to implement adequate prevention of foreseeable toxicity, and (3) to fully reinforce antineoplastic and antiretroviral efficacy. Pharmacokinetics data and clinical cases pinpoint to potential life-threatening interactions between protease inhibitors/ritonavir and taxanes, vinca alkaloids, as well as the anilinoquinazolines erlotinib and gefitinib and irinotecan. Optimal choice of chemotherapy and CART in HIV-infected patients with lung cancer is an individualized multidisciplinary decision, involving clinical and antiretroviral history, and predicting potential adverse events and interactions."
8266,0.005,1.0000,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important outcome measure among HIV-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), but has not been studied extensively in resource-limited settings. Insight in the predictors or correlates of poor HRQoL may be helpful to identify patients most in need of additional support and to design appropriate interventions. A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2012 and April 2013 in 10 healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Patients who were at least 6 months on cART were randomly selected and individual patient data were retrieved from medical records. HRQoL was measured by the WHOQoL-HIVBREF, depressive-symptoms by the Kessler-6 scale, and stigma by the Kalichman internalized AIDS-related stigma scale. Multivariate linear regression analysis was carried-out to examine associations between HRQoL and the other variables. A total of 664 patients (response-rate 95%) participated in the study. A higher level of depressive-symptoms was most strongly and consistently associated with a lower HRQoL, both in terms of the magnitude of the relationship and in the number of HRQoL domains associated with it. Also, a higher level of HIV-stigma was associated with a lower HRQoL except for the physical domain, while obtaining sufficient nutritious food and job opportunity were associated with a better HRQoL except for the spiritual and social domains, respectively. Demographics, clinical, and treatment characteristics yielded few significant associations with HRQoL. Our study findings suggest that interventions to improve HRQoL should focus on reducing depressive-symptoms and HIV-stigma, and on enhancing food security and job opportunity. "

No large scale U.S. studies have investigated the association between food insecurity and severity of HIV disease or the mechanism of this possible association.

1795,0.005,1.0000,"Wasting and food insecurity are commonly seen in patients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, and supplementary feeding is often offered in conjunction with ART. Evidence for the effectiveness of such supplementary feeding is scant. A randomised, investigator-blinded, controlled clinical trial of two types of supplementary food, corn/soy blended flour and a ready-to-use peanut butter-based lipid paste, in wasted adults in Blantyre, Malawi is described and the results summarised. A historical control group who did not receive supplementary food is described as well. Provision of about half of the daily energy requirement as a supplementary food for 14 weeks resulted in more rapid restoration of a normal BMI; and the energy-dense, ready-to-use paste was associated with more rapid weight gain than the blended flour. Survival was similar among the 3 groups. The strong association between lower BMI and survival indirectly suggests that there may well be clinical benefit from supplementary feeding in this population. No differences were seen in ART adherence or quality of life with more rapid restoration of BMI. Further research is urgently needed concerning the widespread practice of supplementary feeding in HIV/AIDS care to most effectively utilize this intervention."
5387,0.005,1.0000,"We used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a quantitative real-time PCR to determine the distribution of three enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) virulence-related genes in stool samples from hospital patients and school children in the Venda region of South Africa. At least one gene was found in 52 (16.5%) samples, 50 (19.6%) from hospitals and 2 (3%) from schools. The AA probe was found in 36 (69%), the aggR gene was found in 41 (79%), and the aap gene was found in 49 (94%) of all positive samples. EAEC was significantly associated with diarrhea and intestinal inflammation and was significantly higher (chi(2) = 5.360, P = 0.021) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive persons (29.5%) than in HIV-negative persons (13.7%). The presence of EAEC genes was significantly associated with occult blood (chi(2) = 30.543, P < 0.0001) in the stool samples. This study suggests that the clinical presentation of EAEC infection may be directly related to the bacterial load as well as to the genetic characteristics of the strains involved."
2104,0.005,1.0000,"Barriers to retention in HIV care are detrimental to patients' progress along the HIV continuum of care. Previous literature has focused on individual, client-level barriers, and interventions to address them. In contrast, less work has examined the role of system-level barriers on HIV care outcomes. This study seeks to understand how individual and systemic barriers individually are associated with clinic appointment attendance and virologic suppression in HIV-infected patients attending the largest HIV clinic in Miami-Dade, FL. In addition, we examined the synergistic effects of these barriers as potential syndemic factors on these health outcomes. Barriers to clinic attendance were determined in a face-to-face study interview with 444 HIV-infected outpatients (187 regular attenders, 191 irregular attenders, and 66 nonattenders) identified from electronic medical records. Compared with the other attendance groups, nonattenders had higher viral loads, were less likely to be virologically suppressed, had lower CD4 counts, had higher depressive symptoms, life chaos, lower quality of life, and higher rates of food insecurity, and recent drug use. Additionally, nonattenders compared with regular attenders had lower physician relationship ratings, had lower medical information clarity and more often reported transportation as a barrier to clinic attendance. When viewed as a syndemic, compared with patients not reporting any barriers, patients with 3 or more individual-level barriers were more likely to have a detectable viral load (odds ratio = 3.60, 95% CI: 1.71 to 7.61). Our findings suggest that patients presenting to the clinic with multiple barriers should be prioritized for assistance and future interventions to improve retention in care. Interventions should address multiple individual and system-level barriers simultaneously with particular attention to addressing depressive symptoms, organizational skills, relationship with the physician, and HIV-related health education.

4721,0.005,1.0000,"Intestinal microsporidiosis is most commonly associated with persistent diarrhea in advanced AIDS cases. To determine the prevalence and clinical manifestations of this infection in HIV/AIDS patients, a single fresh stool sample and blood were collected from 243 (214 HIV-positive and 29 HIV-negative) diarrheal patients. The presence of intestinal microsporidiosis in the stool was determined by Uvitex-2B staining and a PCR-based detection method. HIV screening was done by using ELISA, and reactive samples were confirmed by Western blotting. The CD4+ cell count was analyzed using FACScan. Out of 243 diarrheal patients, 39 (16.0%) cases were positive for intestinal microsporidial infection by either of the methods used. Of the 39, only 18 cases positive by microscopy were also positive by PCR. Based on PCR and microscopic analyses the microsporidial parasites were identified as Enterocytozoon bieneusi (30), Ecephalitozoon intestinalis (6), and double infections (3). All microsporidia-positive cases were HIV-positive, and 92.3% had diarrhea for over 4 weeks. The diarrhea was watery in 79.5% of the patients. Weight loss >10% was recorded in 37 (94.9%) cases. The CD4+ cell count was <100 cells/mm(3) in 84.4% of subjects, and 59.4% of the patients had a CD4+ cell count of < or =50 cells/mm(3), with a mean of 22.8 cells/mm(3). This study revealed that intestinal microsporidiosis is a common cause of chronic diarrhea and severe weight loss in advanced AIDS patients in Ethiopia. This condition is attributable mainly to E. bieneusi. Thus, early diagnosis of intestinal microsporidiosis in HIV/AIDS patients would certainly be helpful in the understanding and management of diarrheal illness."
5080,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and treatment updates include screening recommendations, fourth-generation testing, preexposure prophylaxis, and a paradigm shift; treatment is prevention. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends routine HIV screening in persons 15 to 65 years of age, regardless of risk. Fourth-generation testing is replacing the Western blot and can identify those with acute HIV infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test; however, there are concerns about reduced sensitivity, possible misinterpretation of results, potential for less effective counseling, and possible cost barriers. Preexposure prophylaxis (effective in select high-risk adult populations) is the combination of safer sex practices and continuous primary care prevention services, plus combination antiretroviral therapy. Concerns for preexposure prophylaxis include the necessity of strict medication adherence, limited use among high-risk populations, and community misconceptions of appropriate use. Evidence supports combination antiretroviral therapy as prevention for acute HIV infection, thus lowering community viral loads. Evidence has increased supporting combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment at any CD4 cell count. Resistance testing should guide therapy in all patients on entry into care. Within two weeks of diagnosis of most opportunistic infections, combination antiretroviral therapy should be started; patients with tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis require special considerations."

In the industrialised world, this has led to an increase in severe illness associated with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and, in the developing world, to doubling of tuberculosis cases in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The interaction with Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs when the CD4 count is relatively high (> 200) and tuberculosis (TB) is now the commonest presenting AIDS defining disease in Africa. In international public health terms the interaction between TB and HIV infection has led to the World Health Organisation declaring TB to be a global emergency. Both TB and HIV are diseases of poverty and the key to the reduction of incidence of both diseases is the improvement of socio-economic conditions. Other control methods are case finding and treatment, chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccination. Finding active (sputum positive) case of tuberculosis and treating them is the function of TB control programmes in all countries, but poor adherence to medication has lead to low cure rates and increasing development of drug resistance.

Housing as a structural intervention for homeless people living with HIV/AIDS has been shown both to be feasible and to improve access to care. However, few studies report the impact of accessing stable housing on residents' viral load counts, even though viral load has been accepted as the best predictor of clinical prognosis for over a decade. The Open Door is a nonprofit agency that utilizes a harm reduction, housing first model of care to improve clinical outcomes for homeless people living with HIV. This article describes the first study that utilizes viral load to assess the effectiveness of a housing first approach. During the study period, we found that 69% of residents of The Open Door achieved undetectable viral loads, which far exceeds adherence rates ranging from 13 to 32% that were found in other studies of similar vulnerable populations. This finding supports the feasibility of this approach and its potential impact on reducing HIV morbidity, mortality, and secondary transmission. Given that the majority of the residents were active substance users during the study period and achieved undetectable viral loads, our findings also substantiate other studies demonstrating that substance users are able to maintain clinical adherence."

5667,0.005,1.0000,"The mechanisms responsible for the persistence of HIV-1 after many years of suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been only partially elucidated. Most of the studies investigating HIV-1 persistence have been performed with blood, although it is well known that germinal centers (GCs) within lymph nodes (LNs) serve as primary sites for HIV-1 replication. We sought to identify the memory CD4 T cell populations in blood and LNs that are responsible for the production of replication-competent and infectious HIV-1, as well as for active and persistent virus transcription in ART-treated (for 1.5-14.0 years), aviremic (<50 HIV RNA copies/ml) HIV-infected individuals. We demonstrate that LN CD4 T cells that express programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1; also known as PD-1), which are composed of about 65% T follicular helper cells as defined by the expression of the cell surface receptors CXCR5 and PD-1, are the major source of replication-competent HIV-1 and of infectious virus, as compared to any other (CXCR5(-)PD-1(-) and CXCR5(+)PD-1(-)) blood or LN memory CD4 T cell populations. LN PD-1(+) cells accounted for 46% and 96% of the total pools of memory CD4 T cells containing inducible replication-competent or infectious virus, respectively. Notably, higher levels of cell-associated HIV-1 RNA were present in LN PD-1(+) cells after long-term (up to 12 years) ART than in other memory CD4 T cell subpopulations. These results indicate that LN PD-1(+) cells are the major CD4 T cell compartment in the blood and LNs for the production of replication-competent and infectious HIV-1, and for active and persistent virus transcription in long-term-ART-treated aviremic individuals. Thus, these cells may represent a major obstacle to finding a functional cure for HIV-1 infection."

6974,0.005,1.0000,"Patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis receive multiple blood transfusions and, thus, are susceptible to infections transmitted through blood and blood products, including infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To determine the prevalence of antibody to HIV among patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis in Baltimore and Boston in 1985, we conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study. Repeatedly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-positive serum samples were tested by Western blot analysis. Among 435 patients in Baltimore, 12 (2.8%) were seropositive by both ELISA and Western blot techniques. Among 90 patients in Boston, three (3.3%) were seropositive. Among 100 frozen serum samples obtained from another Boston hemodialysis population in 1980, only one was seropositive. Many repeatedly ELISA-positive specimens were observed in each of the three groups studied, especially the serum samples that had been stored at -30 degrees C to -70 degrees C for four years. Most were nonspecifically reactive as demonstrated by reactivity with an H9-control ELISA plate. Patients undergoing hemodialysis, many of whom have received frequent transfusions in the past, are at increased risk for prior infection with HIV. Serologic testing for either screening or case-finding purposes must be conducted with great attention to specificity; serum samples frozen for prolonged periods are especially likely to be nonspecifically ELISA positive. These findings have implications concerning case-finding purposes, dialysis procedures, renal transplantation, and seroepidemiologic research."
1191,0.005,1.0000,"Intestinal perforation is an extremely uncommon complication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection. We describe two cases of multiple intestinal perforations secondary to MTB in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presenting at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center over a 2-month period. For each case, this was the first presentation of AIDS. One of the two patients had concurrent pulmonary involvement. One patient died, and the other responded to therapy and was discharged in stable condition. The most striking finding in both cases was the extremely large number of acid-fast bacteria seen transmurally on the pathological specimens. This might be related to impaired T-cell function. The resurgence of MTB infection in North America, in the presence of the AIDS epidemic, may result in an increasing frequency of unusual presentations, such as intestinal perforation. Intestinal perforation due to MTB should be considered in HIV-infected patients presenting with an acute abdomen."

This study aims to analyze the proportions of AIDS-defining illnesses (ADIs) before and after HAART. A retrospective study was carried out on 128 new cases of HIV infected patients who first commenced HAART in 2004 at the national HIV reference center. Before commencement of HAART, 76 clinical episodes of ADIs were recorded in 52 patients. Most common being pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (28.9%), PCP (27.6%) and disseminated and extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (11.8%). During HAART, 8 clinical episodes of ADIs were documented in 7 patients with a median time of onset of 10 weeks after initiation of HAART (range, 4-36 weeks). The median CD4 count at the time of the commencement of HAART for these patients was 11 cells/mm(3). ADIs reported include PCP (2 episodes), disseminated and extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2 episodes), extrapulmonary cryptococcosis (1 episode), esophageal candidiasis (1 episode), recurrent pneumonia (1 episode) and disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis (1 episode). Three (37.5%) of these occurred despite a reduction of viral load by at least 2 log(10) and an increased in the CD4 cell count. In conclusion, ADIs can still present after the initiation of successful HAART especially in those with CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm(3). In Malaysia, ADIs are the major causes of HIV/AIDS associated morbidity and mortality, thus increased awareness on the management of these illnesses is warranted especially in the months following HAART."

Our objective was to compare transient elastography (TE) and other noninvasive serum indexes as alternatives to liver biopsy in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients. The fibrosis stage (METAVIR Score), TE, the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, the Forns fibrosis index, FIB-4 and HGM-2 indexes were assessed in 100 patients between January 2007 and January 2008. The diagnostic values were compared by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs). Using TE, the AUROC (95% CI) of liver stiffness was 0.80 (0.72-0.89) when discriminating between F <or= 1 and F > 2, 0.93 (0.85-1.00) when discriminating between F <or= 2 and F > 3 and 0.99 (0.97-1.00) when discriminating between F <or= 3 and F4. For the diagnosis of F >or= 3, the AUROCs of TE were significantly higher than those obtained with the other four noninvasive indexes. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, three cutoff values were chosen to identify F <or= 1 (<7 kPa), F >or= 3 (>or=11 kPa) and F4 (>or=14 kPa). Using these best cutoff scores, the negative predictive value and positive predictive value were 81.1% and 70.2% for the diagnosis of F <or= 1, 96.3% and 60% for the diagnosis of F >or= 3 and 100% and 57.1% for the diagnosis of F4. Thus, Transient elastography accurately predicted liver fibrosis and outperformed other simple noninvasive indexes in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Our data suggest that TE is a helpful tool for guiding therapeutic decisions in clinical practice."
916,0.005,1.0000,"Multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) were detected in cell lines established from peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with: (a) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS), (b) chronic active hepatitis (CAH), (c) papular acrodermatitis (PA) negative for hepatitis B virus antigens but positive for EBV, and (d) epidermolysis bullosa acquisita positive for EBV. All the cell lines established, including those established from AIDS and LAS patients, were examined for the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies directed against the HIV antigens p17 and p24 and for the presence of reverse transcriptase. All the cell lines were found to be negative for HIV. While the cell lines obtained from AIDS patients still express MGCs after more than two years in culture, their supernatants are negative for reverse transcriptase activity and carry phenotypic markers characteristic of B cells. From the LAS and chronic active hepatitis patients we obtained a monolayer of adherent cells almost completely represented by MGCs that lasted for six and four months, respectively. After this period of time a proliferation process took place. Both the cell lines obtained carry B cell phenotypic markers, but MGCs are still a characteristic only for the LAS-derived cell culture. Non infected patients or normal subjects express MGCs only during the early stage of the cultue. The correlation between the presence of MGCs and a retrovirus infection is discussed in the light of the role of MGCs in the pathogenesis of AIDS."
4829,0.005,1.0000,"We have analyzed the sequences of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients receiving antiretroviral therapy to evaluate the drug resistance-associated mutations. Of 84 HIV-1-infected individuals treated with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 43 (51.2%) have been found to carry amino acid substitutions predicted to acquire drug-resistances. One to 3 mutations at amino acid residues reported to be associated with protease inhibitor-resistance were detected in more than 80% of protease inhibitor-naive patients. However, these pre-existing mutations did not seem to raise a real resistance after the initiation of therapy with protease inhibitors. Phenotypic resistance assay was performed with 6 clinical isolates to compare with genotypic resistance. In most of the cases, phenotype was correlated with genotypic changes, however, two strains which were isolated from patients having no experience of chemotherapy showed a decrease in susceptibility to several drugs without any resistance-related mutations detected in their genes. Taken together, determination of phenotypic resistance is necessary, especially when a newly-infected patients starts antiviral therapy."
1428,0.005,1.0000,"Three human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients presented with disseminated pityriasis versicolor-like skin lesions. Histological examination showed features characteristic of epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). Hybridization studies demonstrated the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 5 (HPV5) DNA in two patients and HPV20 in one. A relative increase in CD8+, CD57+ cells, which are known to inhibit cell-mediated cytolysis, was observed in all patients. HLA-DQB 0301 haplotype, which has been associated with EV, was detected in two patients. The findings suggest that infection with EV-associated HPV types can complicate HIV infection. Both cellular immune defects and a hitherto unknown genetic background might explain the occurrence of EV in HIV-infected patients."
6331,0.005,1.0000,"There are few data on drug resistance-associated mutations in the former Soviet Union since, studies have usually been focused on the env or gag genes for subtype information. This study examines the prevalence and patterns of resistance-associated mutations to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors (RTI, PRI) in 278 HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve subjects from countries of Eastern Europe, and defines characteristic polymorphisms of RT and PR sequences in HIV-1 subtype A viruses. Blood samples were collected between 1997 and 2004. Plasma RNA was used for PR-RT amplification by reverse transcription coupled with nested PCR and sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis was done with neighbor-joining trees and bootscanning. Analysis of drug resistance mutations, with Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database's algorithm, resulted in an overall prevalence of 12.9% resistance to RTI and 3.9% to PRI. The most frequent substitutions in the RT region were at positions 62 and 236. V77I substitution in PR was found in 47.8% of samples. Polymorphisms in subtype A sequences were identified. This is the first study reporting the prevalence and patterns of both PRI and RTI resistance-associated mutations in naïve HIV-1 infected patients from the former Soviet Union. These data underline the importance of genotypic resistance testing of chronically HIV-1-infected patients before initiating treatment, in order to select the most suitable drug regimen."
9244,0.005,1.0000,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is one of the most prevalent viruses infecting laboratory mice. Most natural infections are caused by enterotropic strains. Experiments were done to compare the pathogenesis of enterotropic strain MHV-Y in immunocompetent BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice with that in B and T cell-deficient mice. In situ hybridization was used to identify sites of virus replication, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect viral RNA in feces and blood. MHV-Y caused acute subclinical infections restricted to the gastrointestinal tract in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Viral RNA was detected in small intestine and associated lymphoid tissues of immunocompetent mice for 1 week and in cecum and colon for 2 weeks. Infected B cell-deficient mice developed chronic subclinical infection also restricted to the gastrointestinal tract. Viral RNA was detected in the small intestine, cecum, colon, and feces for 7 to 8 weeks. In contrast, infected T cell-deficient mice developed multisystemic lethal infection. During the first week, viral RNA was restricted to the gastrointestinal tract. However, by 2 weeks, mice developed peritonitis, and viral RNA was detected in mesentery and visceral peritoneum. Three to four weeks after virus inoculation, T cell-deficient mice became moribund and viral RNA was detected in multiple organ systems. These results suggest that B cells promote clearance of MHV-Y from intestinal mucosa and that T cells are required to prevent dissemination of MHV-Y from the gastrointestinal tract and associated lymphoid tissues."
857,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the central nervous system is associated with characteristic virological, clinical, and neuropathological findings in adults and children. Productive infection in the brain and spinal cord occurs in blood-derived macrophages, resident microglia, and multinucleated giant cells. Previous work implicated indirect mechanisms for neurotoxicity by HIV-1 gene products or by factors secreted from HIV-1--infected macrophages. However, this cannot explain the paradox between the small numbers of infected cells and the widespread tissue pathology. Based on recent studies from our laboratories, we suggest that HIV-1--infected macrophages can initiate neurotoxicity, which is then amplified through cell-to-cell interactions with astrocytes. Macrophage-astrocyte interactions produce cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta and arachidonic metabolites that cause astroglial proliferation and neuronal injury. Inevitably, the astrogliosis serves to amplify these cellular processes while brain infection maintains itself in macrophage and microglia and possibly in astrocytes (by restricted infection). These findings, taken together, provide fresh insights into how low numbers of productively infected cells could elicit progressive and devastating neurological impairment during HIV-1 disease, and suggest therapeutic strategies to interrupt the pathological process."
2204,0.005,1.0000,"The interferon-gamma ELISPOT assay was used to assess and compare the magnitude and breadth of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific CD8 T cell responses in treatment-naive subjects during the first year of HIV primary infection and during the chronic phase of infection. Twenty-five subjects tested within a year of exposure to HIV resulting in seroconversion and 20 subjects with chronic infection were screened for HIV peptide-specific activity by stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells with a panel of 5-21 HLA class I-restricted HIV peptides (mean, 11.2 +/- 3.5 HIV peptides). There was a significant correlation between the magnitude and breadth of HIV-specific effector responses and time elapsed from exposure (r=0.63 for magnitude vs. time and r=0.64 for breadth vs. time; P<.02, paired t test). Maximal breadth of the HIV gene product reactivity was achieved within 2 months of exposure for Nef-specific responses and by 4 months of exposure for responses directed to Env, Gag, and reverse transcriptase."
5372,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus infection is a major health problem worldwide. The current study estimated seroprevalence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and evaluated associated factors among volunteer blood donors of the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), Pakistan. Of 1,131 volunteer blood donors enrolled, 46 (4.1%) were positive for anti-HCV antibodies. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that positive donors were more likely to be 27-32 years old or >32 years old, have had 1-2 injections or >2 injections in the past year, or 1-5 intravenous (IV) drips or >5 I/V drips in the past 5 years. Positive donors had a family history of jaundice and were more likely to have been shaved (facial and armpit) by barbers. There was high prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies among blood donors of the NWFP. Public awareness programs should target the identified risk factors to prevent HCV transmission. We highlight the weakness of the health care system for blood donation, as it does not offer any record management for donors."
6055,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes complex metabolic changes in infected CD4(+) T cells that lead to cell cycle arrest and cell death by necrosis. To study the viral functions responsible for deleterious effects on the host cell, we quantitated the course of HIV type 1 infection in tissue cultures by using flow cytometry for a virally encoded marker protein, heat-stable antigen (HSA). We found that HSA appeared on the surface of the target cells in two phases: passive acquisition due to association and fusion of virions with target cells, followed by active protein expression from transcription of the integrated provirus. The latter event was necessary for decreased target cell viability. We developed a general mathematical model of viral dynamics in vitro in terms of three effective time-dependent rates: those of cell proliferation, infection, and death. Using this model we show that the predominant contribution to the depletion of viable target cells results from direct cell death rather than cell cycle blockade. This allows us to derive accurate bounds on the time-dependent death rates of infected cells. We infer that the death rate of HIV-infected cells is 80 times greater than that of uninfected cells and that the elimination of the vpr protein reduces the death rate by half. Our approach provides a general method for estimating time-dependent death rates that can be applied to study the dynamics of other viruses."
2749,0.005,1.0000,"Pneumonia is one of the most frequent complications in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-patients with Pneumocystis carinii as the leading cause. The true prevalence of atypical agents such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, C. trachomatis, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in this population of patients is unknown as the currently used method for diagnosing these agents is measurement of antibody levels. However, this method is of limited value in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients who may have a compromised antibody response. To evaluate the prevalence of Chlamydia spp., Legionella spp. and M. pneumoniae in HIV-infected patients with pulmonary disease, this retrospective study has applied inhibitor-controlled polymerase chain reaction analyses on 103 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids representing 103 episodes of pneumonia in 83 HIV-positive patients. L. pneumophila was detected in 1% of the BAL fluids and M. pneumoniae was found as a coexisting pathogen in 2% of the samples. Chlamydia spp. could not be detected in any of the BAL fluids. By culture and staining methods 106 other microorganisms were detected with P. carinii and Streptococcus pneumoniae as the most frequently occurring. Pneumonia due to Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila or Mycoplasma pneumoniae seems to be rare in Danish human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, but might be considered as a possible cause in cases of treatment failure."
3510,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B (HBV) virus infection is characterized by the overproduction of subviral particles (SVP) over infectious Dane particles (VP). Precise regulation of the ratio between these forms is unknown, but its fluctuation may have a clinical impact. An enrichment method was applied to assess the SVP/VP ratio in chronically infected patients (CHB) and to compare the sensitivity of HBs antigen (HBsAg) and DNA detection methods. Plasmas from 9 genotype A-D CHB patients were fractionated on Nycodenz(®) gradients, and both HBV DNA and HBsAg were quantified in each collected fraction using standardized techniques expressed in IU/mL. Infection of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) was performed with crude or fractionated plasma. Independently of the genotype, all plasmas showed a similar rate-zonal separation profile characterized by a bottom DNA-enriched peak surmounted by HBsAg-enriched fractions. Inoculation of PHH with plasma-derived VP-enriched fractions led to long-lasting production of virus in cell supernatants with a SVP/VP ratio similar to that observed in patient plasmas. In the VP fraction, one IU of HBsAg corresponded to approximately 5 million IU of HBV DNA. Rate-zonal gradient separation directly applied on patient plasma allows a better insight into the distribution of VP in HBeAg-positive CHB carriers. This study highlights the sensitivity difference of the techniques classically used to monitor HBV infection and indicates that VP-associated HBsAg contributes modestly to the overall amount of total circulating HBsAg in CHB. Such a fractionation approach should help to understand the fine regulation of HBsAg production over replication at different stages of CHB. "

For the present study, an improved PCR and immunofluorescence serology method were applied to sera and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 27 neuro-AIDS, 36 MS and 24 non-inflammatory control patients. HHV6 DNA was present in 30-40% of the cellular CSF from all groups. In the acellular CSF, HHV6 could be detected in four of 36 MS, 2 of 27 neuro-AIDS and none of the control patients. HHV6 IgG was present in one of 27 neuro-AIDS, and one of 36 MS patients. HHV6 IgG was present in all patients. There was no correlation between clinical features and HHV6 PCR findings or HHV6 antibodies. The significance of the present documentation of HHV6 DNA in the acellular CSF from a minority of MS and neuro-AIDS patients remains to be determined."
9642,0.005,1.0000,"There is evidence in both simian immunodeficiency virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection that class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes play a pivotal role in controlling infection and, potentially, in protecting by immunization. Progress has been made in designing strategies to elicit these responses with HIV-1 vaccines, but methods to reproducibly quantify them have posed difficulties. An interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay, using peptide pools spanning the HIV-1 genes, was developed and standardized. This method is rapid (2 days), sensitive (threshold of detection, > or =0.005%), quantitative, feasible using cryopreserved cells, and able to define epitope specificities. When this assay was applied to 36 HIV-1-seropositive and 10 HIV-1-seronegative subjects, it proved to be robust (specificity, 100%). When responses in natural infection were compared with vaccine-induced responses, vaccine recipient responses were > or =1 log lower, which confirms the importance of using this sensitive assay as an initial screen in vaccine protocols."
6785,0.005,1.0000,"The effects of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein on cellular gene expression were analysed using a Jurkat cell line that was stably transfected with tat gene in a doxycycline-repressible expression system. Expressed Tat protein (aa 1-101) was proved to present basically a nuclear localisation, and to be fully functional to induce HIV LTR transactivation. Tat expression also resulted in protection from Tunicamycin-induced apoptosis as determined by DNA staining and TUNEL assays. We applied proteomics methods to investigate changes in differential protein expression in the transfected Jurkat-Tat cells. Protein identification was performed using 2-D DIGE followed by MS analysis. We identified the down-regulation of several cytoskeletal proteins such as actin, beta-tubulin, annexin II, as well as gelsolin, cofilin and the Rac/Rho-GDI complex. Down-expression of these proteins could be involved in the survival of long-term reservoirs of HIV-infected CD4+ T cells responsible for continuous viral production. In conclusion, in addition to its role in viral mRNA elongation, the proteomic approach has provided insight into the way that Tat modifies host cell gene expression."
8438,0.005,1.0000,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy era, medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) have become critical issues for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). The purpose of this study was to test explanatory models of how patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction are related to medication adherence and HRQOL for PLWH. A total of 344 PLWH receiving health-care services from a federally funded clinic in the southwest USA completed a survey questionnaire about their perception of interactions with providers, their satisfaction with services, their medication adherence, and their HRQOL. Comparing four latent variable structural equation models of direct and mediated effects of patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction, the findings illustrate that the best model is one in which patient-provider interaction has a direct and positive effect on patient satisfaction, medication adherence, and HRQOL. These findings suggest that quality patient-provider interaction is a critical element of health-care services for PLWH, while patient satisfaction is an outcome measure and not a mediating factor for medication adherence and HRQOL.

3817,0.005,1.0000,"We conducted a survival analysis with competing risks to estimate the mortality rate and predictive factors for immunodeficiency-related death in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) in northeast Brazil. A cohort with 2372 PLWH was enrolled between July 2007 and June 2010 and monitored until 31 December 2012 at two healthcare centres. The event of interest was immunodeficiency-related death, which was defined based on the Coding Causes of Death in HIV Protocol (CoDe). The predictor variables were: sociodemographic characteristics, illicit drugs, tobacco, alcohol, nutritional status, antiretroviral therapy, anaemia and CD4 cell count at baseline; and treatment or chemoprophylaxis for tuberculosis (TB) during follow-up. We used Fine & Gray's model for the survival analyses with competing risks, since we had regarded immunodeficiency-unrelated deaths as a competing event, and we estimated the adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratios (SHRs). In 10 012·6 person-years of observation there were 3·1 deaths/100 person-years (2·3 immunodeficiency-related and 0·8 immunodeficiency-unrelated). TB (SHR 4·01), anaemia (SHR 3·58), CD4 <200 cells/mm3 (SHR 3·33) and being unemployed (SHR 1·56) were risk factors for immunodeficiency-related death. This study discloses a 13% coverage by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in our state and adds that anaemia at baseline or the incidence of TB may increase the specific risk of dying from HIV-immunodeficiency, regardless of HAART and CD4."
5735,0.005,1.0000,"The sensitivities of three immunohistological techniques were compared in this study for detecting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in infected cultured human lymphocytes that had been formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. The techniques included in situ hybridization (ISH) with HIV-1 cDNA; immunocytochemistry with HIV-1 p24 monoclonal antibody (ICC-m); and immunocytochemistry with HIV-1 polyclonal antibody from a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (ICC-p). Procedures were optimized for enzyme digestion and for antibody reaction conditions. HIV-1--infected cells and noninfected control cells were tested. Noninfected controls were uniformally negative by all three methods. Infected cells had the highest positivity rate by the ISH method (p less than or equal to 0.0001), and the ICC-p method was more positive than the ICC-m (p less than or equal to 0.0001). Both the ICC-p and the ICC-m techniques were more positive with the cocultivated cell cultures than the ISH, which was more sensitive with the infected continuous cell line (P less than or equal to 0.0001). The ICC-p method had a lower standard deviation on positive results than either the ICC-m or ISH method. The variability observed with these test procedures, reagents, and specimens suggests that these are important technological parameters in detecting p24, with implications for detecting other HIV-1 markers in infected tissues."

Nucleotide sequences of these isolates were aligned with 55 previously reported full-length genomic sequences. Genetic distances were estimated using the 6-parameter method, and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. Strains isolated from patient A and the recipient pair were clustered within a closer range of evolutionary distances than were strains recovered from the recipient pair and patients B and C. Furthermore, strains from patient A and the recipient were also clustered on the S gene sequences of HBV. These results demonstrated that patient A alone was the source of direct transmission to the recipient. This approach can be used to investigate the transmission route of HBV."
9306,0.005,1.0000,"The treatment costs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients continue to rise as patients survive longer because of advances in antiretroviral therapy and effective chemoprophylaxis. Medication costs per patient increase in proportion to progressive immunodeficiency. We retrospectively studied medication costs for 196 HIV-infected patients with stratification by CD4-lymphocyte count. Medication costs per patient-month were correlated with CD4-lymphocyte count (linear regression, r = -.53, P < 0.01), with higher costs associated with lower CD4 counts. The medication cost for patients with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3 averaged $1043 per month. Medication costs per patient increase with the development of each new opportunistic infection or other AIDS-associated condition. Costs can be expected to increase as new therapeutic agents are introduced, as treatment is initiated at earlier stages of HIV infection, and as more patients survive to the point of severe CD4-lymphocyte depletion."
3838,0.005,1.0000,"Low zinc levels and chronic inflammation are common in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Zinc deficiency may promote systemic inflammation, but research on the role of zinc in inflammation among HIV-positive individuals taking account of anti-retroviral therapy is lacking. We assessed the association between serum zinc and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration in a cohort of HIV-positive individuals. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 311 HIV-positive individuals (177 men and 134 women) aged 18-60 years residing in Kathmandu, Nepal. High-sensitive or regular serum CRP concentrations were measured by the latex agglutination nephelometry or turbidimetric method, and zinc concentrations were measured by the atomic absorption method. Relationships were assessed using multiple linear regression analysis. The geometric means of zinc in men and women were 73.83 and 71.93 ug/dL, respectively, and of CRP were 1.64 and 0.96 mg/L, respectively. Mean serum CRP concentration was significantly decreased with increasing serum zinc concentration across zinc tertiles (P for trend = 0.010), with mean serum CRP concentration in the highest tertile of serum zinc concentration was 44.2 % lower than that in the lowest tertile. The mean serum CRP concentrations in men and women in the highest tertile of serum zinc concentrations were 30 and 35.9 % lower, respectively, than that in the lowest tertile (P for trend = 0.263 and 0.162, respectively). We found a significant inverse relation between log zinc and log CRP concentrations (beta for 1 unit change in log zinc; β = -1.79, p = 0.0003). Serum zinc concentration may be inversely associated with serum CRP concentration in HIV-positive individuals."

Our previous work showed that gp120 expression in this system required a functional RRE in cis and required the rev protein in trans (M.-L. Hammarskjöld, J. Heimer, B. Hammarskjöld, I. Sangwan, L. Albert, and D. Rekosh, J. Virol. 63:1959-1966, 1989). Using pGP120, we first mapped an RRE to a 1,042-base-pair (bp) Sau3a fragment in the env region of HIV-2. Both HIV-1 rev (rev1) and HIV-2 rev (rev2) could work in conjunction with this fragment. Further mapping showed that a 272-bp subfragment within the 1,042-bp region was sufficient as an RRE. Surprisingly, the smaller fragment worked only with the rev1 protein and not with its homologous rev2 protein. In addition, the rev2 protein failed to function together with the RRE from HIV-1. We also utilized this system to examine the ability of the rex genes of human T-cell leukemia virus types I and II to functionally substitute for rev. These experiments showed that complementation by both the rexI and rexII proteins required the presence of an RRE. The rex proteins worked well in conjunction with either the HIV-1 or the HIV-2 RRE (the 1,042-bp as well as the 272-bp fragment)."

Sixty-six patients with CHB were enrolled. Hepatitis markers and hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV-Ab) were tested using micro particle enzyme immunoassay kits. Viral load was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the mutation was analyzed by nested PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Most of CHB patients were HBeAg (-ve). The HBeAg status did not have an influence on the presence or absence of T1762/A1764 mutation. HBV-DNA serum level was not significantly different in patients with core mutation and patients without core mutation in HBeAg (-ve) group, while in HBeAg (+ve) group HBV-DNA serum level was significantly higher in patients with core mutation.

However, the relationship between the mutation sites on HIV Vpr gene and subsequent function changes is still not clear. In this study we investigated such relationship in analyzing the Vpr genes of HIV-1 viruses isolated from 208 HIV-1 infected patients from different regions in China. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nested PCR were used to amplify HIV-1 Vpr gene extracted from plasma of 208 HIV-1 infected patients and 153 isolates displayed the target gene sequences. Biological analysis software analyzed the deduced amino acid sequence, and identified the characteristics of the polymorphism of HIV-1 Vpr gene and its clinical significance. Results show the sequence subtypes as follows: CRF01-AE is 51.63%, subtype C is 24.84%, ubtype B is 17.65%, CRF03-AB is 3.92% and CRF08-BC is 1.31%. This paper revealed for the first time the HIV-1 Vpr gene polymorphism in HIV-1 positive individuals in China.: the subtype CRF01-AE is the main Vpr gene subtype in this region. The mutations in the C-terminal were more obvious than those observed in the N-terminal. It was also discovered that in the 77th position, 84.3% of the 153 amino acid sequences were glutamine (Q), which differ from overseas reports. Our data showed that the mutations 63, 70, 85, 86, 89 and 94 of the Vpr gene were possibly correlated with the clinical manifestations of the HIV-1 infected individuals."
5992,0.005,1.0000,"In HIV-infected patients a low CD4:CD8 ratio can persist despite CD4 recovery with long-term antiretroviral treatment (ART). As CD4:CD8 inversion is considered a marker of immune-senescence, we aimed to assess if it was associated with the chronic inflammation state in aging patients with HIV. A total of 112 patients with a >15 year history of HIV infection and ART were included, 85 of whom were suppressed. All subjects were tested for interleukin (IL)-6, high-sensitivity (hs)-PCR, and D-dimer levels. Complete clinical, therapeutic, and hematochemical data were retrieved. Coreceptor tropism based on HIV-DNA gp120 genotyping was also available within the past 6 months. A progressive increase in the CD4:CD8 ratio over time was observed without reaching a plateau. Based on the CD4:CD8 ratio at the time of testing, patients were classified into group A (normal ratio ≥0.9) and group B (<0.9). A normal ratio was observed in 37% of patients. Variables associated with an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio were older age, nadir CD4, and detectable HIV viremia. No association between HIV subtype, coreceptor tropism, cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfections and CD4:CD8 ratio was observed. Group B patients showed a trend for a higher frequency of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia compared to group A patients, but they did not differ in IL-6, hs-PCR, and D-dimer levels or in frequency of severe non-AIDS-associated events. In conclusion, CD4:CD8 ratio normalization occurs rarely, even after several years of ART. Chronic inflammation in patients aging with HIV does not seem to be directly dependent on the CD4:CD8 ratio. However, the persistent immune dysregulation expressed by a CD4:CD8 inversion might be linked to a higher risk of non-AIDS events, especially metabolic disorders."

The goal of this study was to understand how immune reconstitution through antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV(+) patients affects IL-7 serum levels, expression of the IL-7 receptor (CD127), and T-cell cycling. Immunophenotypic analysis of T cells from 29 HIV(-) controls and 43 untreated HIV(+) patients (30 of whom were followed longitudinally for ≤ 24 months on ART) was performed. Restoration of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was driven by increases in CD127(+) naive and central memory T cells. CD4(+) T-cell subsets were not fully restored after 2 years of ART, whereas serum IL-7 levels normalized by 1 year of ART. Mathematical modeling indicated that changes in serum IL-7 levels could be accounted for by changes in the receptor concentration. These data suggest that T-cell restoration after ART in HIV infection is driven predominantly by CD127(+) cells and that decreases of serum IL-7 can be largely explained by improved CD127-mediated clearance."

HIV co-infection worsens the course of HCV infection, particularly in patients with low CD4-cell count, enhancing the need to cancel HCV replication in HIV-infected patients. We report a case of spontaneous recovery of chronic HCV-infection in a HCV-HIV co-infected hemophiliac with the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy and immune restoration. Retrospective analysis of frozen blood samples showed that a decrease in HCV-RNA in parallel with the increase of CD4 and CD8-cell counts, accompanied by a peak of transaminases. The respective effect of immune restoration and of high doses of ritonavir are discussed."
5113,0.005,1.0000,"This study explores whether MHC genes affect manifestations of opportunistic infections in HIV patients not treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and immunopathologic responses to pre-existing infections in patients who achieved immune reconstitution following HAART (i.e., ""immune restoration diseases"" or IRD). HLA-B27 and B17 were relatively rare in all HIV patients, but no HLA-B alleles significantly affected cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease in patients who had not received HAART. However coexpression of alleles previously defined as the 44.1 ancestral haplotype (HLA-A2, -B44, and -DR4) was more common in the MAC and CMV patients. After HAART, HLA-B44 and (HLA-A2, -B44, -DR4) were found in 66% and 33%, respectively, of patients who experienced an IRD manifested as CMV retinitis and/or encephalomyelitis. This was confirmed by examination of microsatellite alleles, where the C1_2_5 locus in the class I region was most concordant with the 44.1 haplotype in the patients. HLA-B44 was not associated with IRD initiated by Mycobacterium sp, cutaneous VZV or HSV, or HCV infections, suggesting distinct pathologic mechanisms are responsible. CMV retinitis/encephalomyelitis IRD patients had marginally lower pretreatment CD4 T-cell counts, but indices of immune reconstitution were similar in all groups and independent of HLA-B44."
2950,0.005,1.0000,"The effect of coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) on immune restoration in 39 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients during treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) was prospectively evaluated. After 48 weeks of treatment, HCV-coinfected patients had lower increases in CD4% (P = .05), total CD4+ (P = .01), and naïve CD4+ (P = .06) T cells than did single-infected subjects. Higher baseline naïve CD4+ T-cell levels were associated with better CD4+ (P = .05) and naïve CD4+ (P < .001) T-cell recovery. After a 4-year follow up, the differences disappeared (median CD4+ increase: 291 and 306 cells for HCV-positive and HCV-negative patients, respectively, P = .9). No significant differences were seen in memory CD4+ T cells (P = .30), and CD8+ cells expressing CD38 (P = .10) and CD28 (P = .73). These results suggest that, independently of other factors, infection with HCV blunts early CD4+ T-cell recovery in HIV-infected patients treated with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, as good control of viral replication is maintained, satisfactory long-term immune restoration can nonetheless be achieved."
8575,0.005,1.0000,"Programmed cell death-1/programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitory signal pathway has been verified to be involved in the establishment of persistent viral infections. Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 engagement to reinvigorate T cell activity is supposed to be a potential therapeutic scheme. Studies have verified the participation of PD-1/PD-L1 in hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein-regulated immune response. To determine the roles of PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway in HCV F protein-induced immunoreaction in chronic HCV infection, variations in T cells were examined. The results showed that PD-1 expression on CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells was increased with HCV F stimulation in both chronic HCV patients and healthy controls, and could be reduced partly by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking. Additionally, by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking, HCV F-induced inhibition of T cell proliferation and promotion of cellular apoptosis were partly or even totally recovered. Furthermore, levels of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines were elevated in the presence of anti-PD-L1 antibody. All these results indicated that PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway also participates in HCV F protein-induced immunoregulation. PD-1/PD-L1 blocking plays important roles in the restoration of effective functionality of the impaired T cells in chronic HCV patients. "

4197,0.005,1.0000,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections lead to rapid depletion of CD4(+) T cells from gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Although the administration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been shown to increase CD4(+) T-cell levels in the peripheral blood in both SIV and HIV infections, its efficacy in restoring intestinal mucosal CD4(+) T cells has not been well investigated. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of virally induced disruptions in the mucosal immune system, we have evaluated longitudinal changes in viral burden, T-cell subsets, and mucosal gene expression profiles in SIV-infected rhesus macaques in the absence or presence of ART. Our results demonstrate a dramatic suppression of mucosal viral loads and rapid reconstitution of CD4(+) T cells in GALT in animals receiving ART that were not observed in untreated SIV-infected animals. DNA microarray-based gene expression profiling indicated that CD4(+) T-cell restoration in GALT was associated with up regulation of growth factors and genes involved in repair and regeneration of the mucosal epithelium. In contrast, untreated SIV-infected animals increased expression of lymphocyte activation and inflammatory response-associated genes and did not up regulate mucosal growth and repair associated transcription. In conclusion, these data indicate that initiating ART in primary SIV infection may lead to the restoration of the mucosal immune system through reduction of inflammation and promotion of epithelial repair in the intestinal mucosa."

Earlier studies of adults there had shown an intermediate degree of HBV endemicity (hepatitis B surface antigen carrier rate greater than 2%). Persons were selected by systematic cluster sampling in five different geographical areas of Italy. The overall prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was 0.6%. The overall prevalence of at least one marker of HBV was 2.8%; it increased from 1.7% among children 3-5 years of age to 4.5% in teenagers 17-19 years of age (P less than 0.001). The prevalence of any HBV marker was higher in southern then in northern areas (3.5% vs. 1.8%, P less than 0.001). A significant association was found with sociodemographic features. Persons whose fathers had less than 6 years of schooling had a 2.3-fold risk (C.I. 95% = 1.5-3.4) while those belonging to a household of six or more under one roof had a 1.7-fold risk (C.I. 95% = 1.2-2.4) of previous exposure to HBV infection. These findings indicate that, today in Italy, exposure to HBV infection at a young age is very low and suggest a shift towards a low degree of endemicity following improvements in socio-economic conditions, decreased family size and increasing use of disposable syringes during recent years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Many orphans in UNM report symptoms of psychological trauma. The primary study objective was to evaluate a multidisciplinary program integrating HIV prevention with an existing package of mental health services. We randomly selected 120 orphans between ages 15-25 years served by UNM and evaluated sexually-transmitted infections, HIV risk-taking behaviors and knowledge, and mental health at baseline, 5, 9, and 12 months. Increased trauma symptoms at baseline were associated with poorer coping skills and social functioning, and increased psychological distress and HIV risk-taking behavior. Following the 12-month intervention, trauma symptoms declined significantly, with those accessing counseling services showing greatest improvement. Orphans with the highest trauma scores benefited most from the intervention. In this at-risk population, addressing mental health issues in the context of HIV prevention is critical."

4996,0.005,1.0000,"Depression is associated with poor antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS. This relationship may be moderated by an individual's social network characteristics. Our study sought to examine social network correlates of treatment adherence among HIV-positive men recruited from social service agencies throughout Los Angeles County (N = 150) to inform technology-driven social support interventions for this population. We administered egocentric social network and computer-assisted survey interviews focused on demographic characteristics, health history, depressive symptoms, and ART adherence, where adherence was assessed by the number of reasons participants missed taking their medication, if ever. Significant univariate correlates of adherence were included in a multivariable regression analysis, where the moderating effect of having a network member who reminds participants to take their HIV medication on the relationship between depression and adherence was tested. Over 60% of participants reported clinically significant depressive symptoms; this was significantly associated with lower adherence among those without someone in their social network to remind them about taking their HIV medication, even after adjusting for covariates in an ordinary least squares regression (adjusted mean difference b = -1.61, SE = 0.42, p = 0.0003). Having a network member who reminds participants to take their ART medication significantly ameliorated the negative association between depression and treatment adherence, especially for those reporting greater depressive symptoms (p = 0.0394). Additionally, participants demonstrated high rates of technology use to communicate with social network members. In order to achieve the aims of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, innovative interventions addressing mental health to improve ART adherence are needed. Network strategies that leverage technology may be helpful for improving ART adherence among HIV-positive men with comorbid depressive symptoms."

7294,0.005,1.0000,"In 1989 the prevalence of hepatitis B virus markers was studied by radioimmunoassay in a sample of 1,426 healthy children, 3 to 11 years old, attending kindergarten and the primary schools in a large urban area of the Apulia Region in Southern Italy, where the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence among pregnant women is 5.6%. The overall prevalence of any hepatitis B virus marker was 3.4%, increasing from 1.7% in 3- to 5-year-old children to 5% in 10- to 11-year-old children (P less than 0.002). Prevalence was not associated with the father's years of schooling (odds ratio, 1.98; confidence interval, 95% (0.9 to 4.6] or with the family size (odds ratio, 2.96; confidence interval, (0.7 to 11.8]. The overall HBsAg prevalence was 0.8, a rate that was lower than the 5.6% found in pregnant women. The finding of only 12 HBsAg-positive children of the 1,426 tested, despite 80 of them being born to HBsAg-positive carrier mothers (on the basis of the 5.6% HBsAg prevalence among pregnant women), is probably attributable to the low proportion (5%) of hepatitis B e antigen positivity among the HBsAg-positive carrier mothers in the study area. The observed low HBV infection rate in younger age groups, which confirms recent studies in other areas of Italy, appears to be the result of several factors: improved socioeconomic conditions; decreased family size; and increased use of disposable syringes in the last few years."

Among the 403 blood donors, 33 (8.2%), 21 (5.2%), and 27 (6.7%) tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or HBV DNA, HCV RNA, and HDV RNA, respectively. Collectively, 55 donors were viremic for one or more of these viruses, and included 54 first-time donors (18.7%) and 1 repeat donor (0.9%) (P < 0.0001). One discrepant case with HBsAg detectable only at MBC was negative for HBsAg, HBV DNA and anti-HBc in this study. Four donors who were HCV-viremic in this study were negative for anti-HCV by the MBC method. Further efforts to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the currently-used tests are urgently required in Mongolia. Three donors who were positive for anti-HBc and anti-HDV but negative for HBsAg, had both HBV DNA and HDV RNA. This suggests that introduction of a new anti-HDV serological test is useful for not only HDV screening but also HBV screening of anti-HBc-positive, HBsAg negative donors, considering a possibility of viral interference by coexisting HDV."

In Egypt, data about epidemiology, the spectrum of disease, and impact of HDV on HBV infection are rare. To assess the prevalence, clinical and virological characteristics of HDV infection among Egyptian patients with chronic HBV. Adult patients with Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive were evaluated for the presence of HDV using anti HDV-IgG and HDV RNA by RT-PCR. Routine laboratory investigations, genotypes and subtypes for both HBV and HDV, abdominal sonography, and transient elastography (TE) were done. Liver biopsy was performed only in whenever indicated. One hundred and twenty-one treatment-naïve chronic HBV patients were included. Wild HBV genotype-D2 was found in 98.2% and 81.9% were HBeAg negative. Prevalence of HDV was 8.3% by anti-HDV IgG and 9.9% by RT-PCR. Wild HDV genotype-IIb was reported in 83.3%. HDV infection was more common in males, 90.9% of delta patients were HBeAg negative. Compared to the mono-infected HBV, concomitant HBV/HDV infection was not associated with more derangment in ALT nor advanced stage of fibrosis. 66.7% of HDV patients had significantly lower HBV-DNA level compared to the non-delta patients (P < 0.001). HDV is not uncommon in Egypt. HBV genotype-D was associated with HDV genotype-IIb. Delta infection was associated with negative HBeAg status, reduction of HBV replication, but neither influenced the clinical course nor increased significant liver damage risk."

Because of repeated flares, administration of lamivudine was started in March 2002. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA immediately decreased, but the serum level of alanine aminotransferase gradually increased. Drug-induced hepatitis due to lamivudine was excluded. It was suspected that the progression of liver damage was caused by hepatitis delta virus (HDV), because the patient was positive for both anti-HDV antibody and HDV RNA. Co-infection of HDV should be considered a possibility if liver injury is not improved by lamivudine therapy."

Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection existed in all the examined areas without any significant difference regarding HDAg detection rate. A relationship of intrahepatic HDAg to the pathologic type of the liver disease was observed. The HDAg detection rate in chronic liver diseases and severe hepatitis was higher than in other liver diseases. It suggested that HDV infection was associated with the progression and chronicity of the liver disease. Studies on the relationship between HDV infection and HBV replication showed that HBV replication might be suppressed by HDV infection. Both HDV and HBV, however, could replicate in the same hepatocyte simultaneously."
9794,0.005,1.0000,"Viral liver diseases are frequent comorbidities and major contributors to death in HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Although cure of hepatitis C and control of hepatitis B with antivirals avert liver disease progression in most HIV-coinfected patients, the lack of satisfactory treatment for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection remains a major threat for developing cirrhosis and liver cancer in this population. In the European Union (EU) and North America, sexual contact has replaced injection drug use that has been the major transmission route for HDV in HIV-positive persons. PegIFNα is the only approved HDV therapy; however, sustained HDV-RNA clearance is achieved by less than 25%. The recent discovery of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide as the key hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV cell entry receptor has opened the door to a new therapeutic era. Indeed, promising results have been released using Myrcludex-B, a sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide inhibitor. More encouraging are data with new classes of HDV blockers, such as prenylation inhibitors (i.e. lonafarnib) and nucleic acid polymers. At this time, sustained suppression of HDV replication is the primary goal of HDV therapy, as it is associated with normalization of liver enzymes and histological improvement. Of note, the use of specific antivirals for HDV must be given along with anti-HBV agents to prevent HBV rebounds following removal of viral interference. The lack of persistent forms of HDV-RNA could provide a unique opportunity for curing hepatitis delta, even without eliminating HBV circular covalently closed DNA. Ultimately, suppression of HDV replication along with hepatitis B surface antigen clearance once drugs are off would be the best reflect of hepatitis delta cure."

In the mid-eighties, an outbreak of HDV fulminant hepatitis (FH) in the Central African Republic (CAR) killed 88% of patients hospitalized in Bangui. We evaluated infections with HBV and HDV among students and pregnant women, 25 years after the fulminant hepatitis (FH) outbreak to determine (i) the prevalence of HBV and HDV infection in this population, (ii) the clinical risk factors for HBV and/or HDV infections, and (iii) to characterize and compare the strains from the FH outbreak in the 1980s to the 2010 HBV-HDV strains. We performed a cross sectional study with historical comparison on FH-stored samples (n = 179) from 159 patients and dried blood-spots from volunteer students and pregnant women groups (n = 2172). We analyzed risk factors potentially associated with HBV and HDV. Previous HBV infection (presence of anti-HBc) occurred in 345/1290 students (26.7%) and 186/870 pregnant women (21.4%)(p = 0.005), including 110 students (8.8%) and 71 pregnant women (8.2%), who were also HBsAg-positive (p = 0.824). HDV infection occurred more frequently in pregnant women (n = 13; 18.8%) than students (n = 6; 5.4%) (p = 0.010). Infection in childhood was probably the main HBV risk factor. The risk factors for HDV infection were age (p = 0.040), transfusion (p = 0.039), and a tendency for tattooing (p = 0.055) and absence of condom use (p = 0.049). HBV-E and HDV-1 were highly prevalent during both the FH outbreak and the 2010 screening project. For historical samples, due to storage conditions and despite several attempts, we could only obtain partial HDV amplification representing 25% of the full-length genome. The HDV-1 mid-eighties FH-strains did not form a specific clade and were affiliated to two different HDV-1 African subgenotypes, one of which also includes the 2010 HDV-1 strains. In the Central African Republic, these findings indicate a high prevalence of previous and current HBV-E and HDV-1 infections both in the mid-eighties fulminant hepatitis outbreak and among asymptomatic young adults in 2010, and reinforce the need for universal HBV vaccination and the prevention of HDV transmission among HBsAg-positive patients through blood or sexual routes."
8788,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatic iron overload has been described in chronic hepatitis C as a cofactor affecting fibrosis progression. Data in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection are scarce. We investigated hepatic iron deposits and serum iron indices in 205 consecutive patients with hepatitis B and compensated liver disease. Mean age of the patients was 42.4 ± 12.4 years and 72.5% were males. Coinfection with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) was present in 8.8%. At least one of the serum iron indices was elevated in 41.5% of cases. Hepatic iron deposits were detected in 35.1% of patients, most of them being minimal (grade I) (59.7%) or mild (grade II) (27.8%). Variables significantly associated with hepatic iron deposits were male gender (P = 0.001), serum ferritin (P = 0.008), γGT (P = 0.05) and alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.05) levels. By multivariate analysis hepatic iron deposits correlated with serum ferritin [odds ratio (OR) 1.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.4, P = 0.002]. Presence of mild-moderate (grades II and III) hepatic iron deposits could be excluded with high negative predictive value (90%) when serum ferritin was within normal values. A significant correlation between coinfection with HDV and hepatic iron deposits was also found (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.52-11.82, P = 0.003). When compared to monoinfected cases, HDV positive patients had more elevated γGT (P = 0.03), more advanced fibrosis and more severe iron deposits (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, in well-compensated chronic hepatitis B infection, hepatic iron deposits and elevation of serum iron indices are common, especially in male gender and in patients coinfected with HDV. As HBV/HDV liver disease is generally more rapidly progressive than that caused by HBV monoinfection, we speculate that iron overload may be one of the factors contributing to the severity of liver disease."

The features of the illness conformed to a syndrome of HDV infection in young males carrying the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); a latent HBsAg state was documented in many patients by a history of prior exposure to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or by the absence of IgM antibodies to the HB core antigen. Characteristic of the disease were the clinical overture as a severe hepatitis, the lobular involvement by an extensive necroinflammatory reaction, the exuberant expression of intrahepatic hepatitis delta antigen and an atypical HBV profile of inactive infection or accelerated seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe.

These rates remained 17 times greater among AAPI children into the 1990s. Now, although almost 90% of AAPI children born after 1993 receive hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) in time to prevent HBV infection, many born before 1993 do not.

We examined the influence of coinfection with HBV on prevalence of steatosis in chronic hepatitis C in a multi-centre cohort of HBV-HCV subjects, and by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. We centrally and blindly assessed steatosis prevalence and severity in a cohort of HBV-HCV coinfected subjects compared to HCV and HBV monoinfected controls and we performed a systematic review of studies addressing the prevalence of steatosis in HBV-HCV subjects compared to HCV controls. In the clinical cohort, we included 85 HBV-HCV, 69 HBV and 112 HCV subjects from 16 international centres. There was no significant difference in steatosis prevalence between the HBV-HCV and the HCV groups (33% vs 45%, P = .11). In subgroup analysis, lean HBV-HCV subjects with detectable HBV DNA had less steatosis than lean HCV subjects matched for HCV viremia (15% vs 45%, P = .02).

6678,0.005,1.0000,"Although the genetic variability of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in HBV-infected patients has been extensively studied, reports on genotypes, subtypes and mutations in the S region of HBV strains from Chinese blood donors are limited. In this study, 245 blood samples from HBsAg-positive blood donors were collected from five geographically diverse blood centers in China. The S region of HBV was amplified, and the HBV genotype and subtype were determined. The amino acid sequences of the S region were aligned, and mutations related to the failure of immunization and HBsAg detection were determined. Of the 245 samples, 228 (93 %) were genotyped successfully. We found that genotypes B, C, D and A accounted for 58.8 %, 21.9 %, 6.6 % and 3.95 % of the isolates, respectively. The distribution of HBV antigen subtypes was as follows: adw (67.6 %), adr (23.3 %) and ayw (8.7 %). Mutations were present in 39 (17.1 %) of 228 samples in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of the S region. This study demonstrated that HBV genotype/subtype B/adw was the most frequent strain circulating in HBV-infected Chinese blood donors, followed by C/adr. The occurrence of MHR mutants in HBV-infected blood donors and the potential failure to detect some of them in collected units poses a threat to transfusion safety."

3886,0.005,1.0000,"Low-level viremia due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) was demonstrated in the sera of two patients diagnosed previously as having non-B, non-C chronic hepatitis. Both patients had a ""silent"" HBV infection, because they were negative for both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis B core antibody. The TaqMan chemistry polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified the HBV DNA, enabling quantitation of the virus in their sera. Their serum HBV DNA concentrations were low: the amount of each HBV S or X gene amplified showed there were approximately 10(3) copies/ml and HBV DNA was detected occasionally during clinical follow-up. Positive HBsAg staining in liver tissues was demonstrated by an immunoperoxidase technique. Vertical transmission of silent HBV from one patient to her daughter was confirmed. Direct nucleotide sequencing of the amplified HBV X region revealed several mutations, suggesting reduced viral replication. One patient had a T-to-C mutation at the extreme 5'-terminus of the direct repeat 2 region and the other exhibited a coexisting X region with a 155-nucleotide deletion. These findings suggest that HBV replication is suppressed considerably in patients with silent hepatitis B."
7724,0.005,1.0000,"To provide a basis for improved prevention and treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) re-infection after liver transplantation, variations in the S and P genes of HBV under immunosuppression in vitro and their association with patient prognosis were investigated. For the in vitro study, HepG2.2.15 hepatocellular carcinoma cells stably producing HBV particles were treated with the immunosuppressants methylprednisolone (MP) and tacrolimus (FK506) at doses found to be non-toxic by the methylthiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) cell viability assay. MP dose-dependently inhibited HBV DNA expression in HepG2.2.15 cells, while FK506 did not, as determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). By gene sequencing, both MP and FK506 were found to cause variations in HBV S, P, and S/P overlapping regions. MP- but not FK506-induced mutations were common in the glucocorticoid response element of the P region, while both immunosuppressants caused mutations outside the nucleoside analogue resistance sites. For the in vivo study, 14 patients with HBV-related end-stage liver disease re-infected after liver transplantation, and 20 cases without HBV re-infection as controls, were studied. Seventy-five percent of re-infected recipients showed multi-loci amino acid mutations at different sites besides lamivudine (LAM)-resistant loci in the P region, including in the glucocorticoid response element. Fifty percent of re-infected recipients had mutations in the ""a"" determinant region and flanking sequences. Re-infection was associated with negative serum hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG), as measured by a microparticle capture enzyme immunoassay. Nucleotide mutations in the S region caused missense or synonymous mutations, which caused synonymous mutations in the overlapping P region. These results showed that effects of immunosuppressants on HBV genes in vitro were different from those in clinical recipients. Positive HBV DNA and gene mutations pre-transplantation were factors affecting re-infection post-transplantation. Multiple mutations found in the P and S genes suggest that the formation of quasispecies contributes to HBV re-infection after liver transplantation."
4639,0.005,1.0000,"A plasma pool from 12 asymptomatic carriers seropositive for antibody against hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe) contained hepatitis B virus (HBV) with chimpanzee infectious doses of 1-100/mL, and another pool from 12 carriers positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) contained 10(8)/mL doses or more. The HBeAg-positive pool contained 10(6)-fold more HBV DNA than the anti-HBe-positive pool, reflecting the difference in infectivity in chimpanzees. The precore region sequences of HBV DNA in the two plasma pools were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and separate HBV DNA clones were propagated for determining the nucleotide sequence. Of 114 clones from the anti-HBe-positive pool, 113 displayed a point mutation from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 83 in the precore region, which converted codon 28 for tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG), and the remaining clone had a point mutation from adenine to cytosine at the first letter of codon 1 (CTG) to inhibit the translation initiation of the precore region. Precore region defects, in contrast, were observed in only 10 (8%) of 119 clones from the HBeAg-positive pool. These results indicate the infectious capacity of HBV mutants, defective in the precore region and incapable of directing the synthesis and secretion of HBeAg, which prevail in the circulation of hosts after they seroconvert from HBeAg to anti-HBe."
4466,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health issue worldwide. Several factors including core gene variation are responsible for the development of chronicity of HBV infection. The present study was designed to identify the variations in the core region of the HBV genome in a local population of chronic hepatitis B patients (n = 57) using a PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Fifty subjects were found to be positive for the presence of HBV DNA. For the core region genotyping, the Ava II and Msp I restriction enzymes were used. Mutations at nucleotide (nt) 2147 and nt 2362 in the HBV genome in the core region for Ava II (A4 type, 74%) and nt 2331 for Msp I (M1 type, 66%) were observed as the most common pattern. These results are different from those of previously reported studies on other populations and thus appear to be unique to the Pakistani population. This type of characterization of core mutants may be useful for the design of vaccines based on viral epitopes that are effective for the Pakistani population. Moreover, these unique genotypic patterns for the HBV core gene might be some of the main factors responsible for understanding the underlying mechanism by which HBV chronicity is developed in the Pakistani population."

Although laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas (LSCCs) in HIV-positive patients are uncommon, a higher incidence of this malignancy in HIV-positive patients than in the general population has been reported. As a proportion of LSCCs are associated with HPV in the general population, the clinicopathological features of a series of LSCCs developing in HIV-positive patients were evaluated to investigate the possible relationship with HPV infection, and infection with other oncogenic viruses."
5454,0.005,1.0000,"In the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, the incidence of non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADC) has increased and contributes to a growing proportion of mortality in the aging HIV-infected population. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of increased cancer risk are incompletely understood. Potential contributors include oncogenic effects of the HIV virus, immunosuppression, chronic inflammation and immune activation, exposure to HAART, higher rates of oncogenic viral coinfections and traditional cancer risk factors. HIV-infected patients often present with NADC at younger ages with more aggressive or advanced stage disease. However, when standard cancer therapy is given, treatment outcomes appear similar to the non-HIV population. These facts highlight the importance of clinicians' maintaining a high index of suspicion, performing age-appropriate screening, and optimizing cancer therapy. Development of novel strategies for screening, prevention, and treatment of NADC will be required to reverse these epidemiologic trends and improve the survival of HIV-infected patients. "
7524,0.005,1.0000,"Portugal has been the western European country with the highest rate of notified acquired immunodeficiency [corrected] syndrome (AIDS) cases since 1999 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection cases since 2000. Nonetheless, exact information on the magnitude and trends of recently acquired infections is missing. In a cross-sectional study we aimed to determine HIV prevalence, the proportion of recently acquired infections and the incidence among patients attending a Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) clinic and among HIV positive cases tested at the AIDS Reference Laboratory (ARL), by using the Avidity Index (AI) of antibodies to identify recent HIV-1 seroconversions. Demographic and behavioural data were collected. At the STI clinic 253 patients were enrolled, 16 were found to be HIV infected (14 HIV-1, 2 HIV-2) and a prevalence of 6.3% was obtained. Four recent HIV-1 infections were identified and the HIV-1 incidence was 3.3% per year. At the ARL, 332 newly diagnosed cases of HIV-1 infection were studied, 59 (17.8%) were recent infections and an annual incidence of 4.1% was estimated. These findings support STI clinics as key sentinel sites for recently acquired HIV infections and illustrate the viability of testing for recent HIV infections in these settings and reinforce the value of this method in the surveillance for better monitoring current trends of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Portugal."
3008,0.005,1.0000,"In parts of Asia, about 10% of the population have chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and cancer patients who are HBV carriers are frequently complicated by HBV reactivation while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. The condition may result in varying degrees of liver damage, causing disruption in chemotherapy and compromising the patients' prognosis. With the increasing use of chemotherapy paralleling the rise in breast cancer incidence, the occurrence of HBV reactivation is likely to further increase. Recent reports have suggested that the anti-viral agent, lamivudine, may reduce HBV reactivation and its associated morbidity. However, most studies are based on small series of lymphoma patients, while information on the other high risk population, namely breast cancer patients, has been lacking. In this study, we studied the role of lamivudine in preventing HBV reactivation and its associated morbidity in breast cancer patients with chronic HBV infection who were planned for chemotherapy. Two groups were studied. One group consisted of 31 patients who received 'prophylactic lamivudine' prior to and until 8 weeks after discontinuing chemotherapy. The other comprised of 61 historical controls who underwent chemotherapy without prophylactic lamivudine. The outcomes, in terms of the efficacy of lamivudine in reducing the incidence of HBV reactivation, and diminishing morbidity during chemotherapy were compared. The results revealed that in the prophylactic lamivudine group, despite a significantly higher proportion receiving anthracyclines, there was significantly fewer incidences of hepatitis (12.9 vs. 59.0%, p < 0.001), less HBV reactivation (6.5. vs. 31.1%, p=0.008), and less disruption of chemotherapy (16.1% vs. 45.9%, p=0.006). We conclude that prophylactic lamivudine significantly reduces the incidence of HBV reactivation and the overall morbidity of breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy."
9820,0.005,1.0000,"The incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men who have sex with men has increased in recent years and is associated with high-risk sexual behavior. Behavioral interventions that target high-risk behavior associated with HCV transmission and treatment with direct-acting antivirals may prevent further HCV infections. We predicted the effect of behavioral and treatment interventions on HCV incidence and prevalence among HIV-infected men who have sex with men up to 2030 using a HCV transmission model parameterized with data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. We assessed behavioral interventions associated with further increase, stabilization, and decrease in the size of the population with high-risk behavior. Treatment interventions included increase in treatment uptake and use of direct-acting antivirals. If we assumed that without behavioral interventions high-risk behavior spread further according to the trends observed over the last decade and that the treatment practice did not change, HCV incidence converged to 10.7/100 person-years. All assessed behavioral interventions alone resulted in reduced HCV transmissions. Stabilization of high-risk behavior combined with increased treatment uptake and the use of direct-acting antivirals reduced incidence by 77% (from 2.2 in 2015 to 0.5/100 person-years) and prevalence by 81% (from 4.8% in 2015 to 0.9%) over the next 15 years. Increasing treatment uptake was more effective than increasing treatment efficacy to reduce HCV incidence and prevalence. A decrease in high-risk behavior led to a rapid decline in HCV incidence, independent of treatment interventions."

A recent systematic review by Klein et al concluded that further studies are essential to elucidate the link between HIV infection and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). We prospectively evaluated 24 consecutive, active people presenting with an acute DVT; 13 consented to HIV testing, revealing an HIV prevalence of 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-1.04). In a matched healthy control group, the HIV prevalence was 4% (95% CI, 0.039-0.041). The high HIV prevalence in the DVT group that consented to testing was also significantly higher compared to that in the South African population, estimated to be 10% in 2005. Although the study numbers were low, a statistically significant increased prevalence of HIV infection was found in patients with acute DVTs."

1576,0.005,1.0000,"Dentists in the Philippines were surveyed for evidence of past hepatitis A and B virus infections. Of the 234 dentists examined, 201 (85.9 per cent) were found to have been infected by HA virus and 137 (58.5 per cent) had been infected by HB virus. The proportion with evidence of past HB virus infection increased as the years in dental practice increased. This increment with age was not found in the general population of the Philippines. It is considered that the incremental pattern could be attributed to the summation of risk during many years of providing dental treatment. Comparing the proportion of dentists with HBV antibodies (anti-HBs/c) in the Philippines, Japan, USA and Denmark, the Philippine dentists were found to be more frequently infected than dentists in the other countries. However, the increment in the proportion positive for HBV as the years in practice advanced was consistent with that found in Japan. The prevalence of post HA virus infection in Philippine dentists was higher than the proportion for dentists in Japan but in both countries it is probable that dentists are infected at the same rate as the general population."

Other inflammatory disorders may occur in HTLV-I-infected patients, such as sicca syndrome resembling Sjögren's syndrome. The sicca syndrome may be the unique clinical manifestation of HTLV-I infection, but is associated frequently with TSP/HAM, which could suggest that sicca syndrome might be an early event in disease progression to TSP/HAM in some cases. We investigated whether peculiar pX and LTR mutations could be related to sicca syndrome, or might argue the existence of clinical progression to TSP/HAM. pX, especially pX(I), pX(II), and pX(IV) ORFs corresponding to Tax cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes, and LTR regions from Caribbean patients who have sicca syndrome with or without TSP/HAM, ATL patients, and healthy carriers were sequenced. The sequences were aligned and compared with ATK-1 prototype and published sequences. LTR sequences exhibited 1.5-2.4% of divergence with ATK-1. pX-sequenced regions showed a lower homology within p12(I) encoding sequences. Only few mutations were found within functionally important regions, but were not associated specifically with the clinical status. Finally, no mutations that could be related to sicca syndrome or argue the existence of clinical progression to TSP/HAM were found. It would be of interest to study the clinical evolution of HTLV-I-sicca syndrome in patients and to determine HTLV-I sequences from peripheral blood and salivary glands at different stages."

3672,0.005,1.0000,"The effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 on human mononuclear phagocyte effector functions in response to infection with bacteria of the Mycobacterium avium-intracellular complex (MAC) was investigated. The results showed that interaction of HIV-1 or its constituents with CD4 expressed in the monocyte membrane led to substantial impairment of monocyte capacity to restrict the intracellular growth of MAC. This was accompanied by substantially decreased production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha by HIV-1-exposed and MAC-infected monocytes. However, productive HIV-1 infection of monocytes was not required to induce the observed effects. These studies suggest that HIV-1 may interfere with innate mononuclear phagocyte function. This may be of physiologic importance in the late stages of AIDS, when an impaired T cell immunity can no longer provide proper immune-activating signals, and may help to explain the undue susceptibility to MAC infections in these patients."
6953,0.005,1.0000,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a cytokine that plays an important role in the regulation of the immune system. Gene polymorphisms of IL-10 have been associated with the different expression levels of this cytokine. In hepatitis C virus infection, IL-10 appears to interfere with the progression of disease, viral persistence and the response to therapy. This study investigated genetic variability in the IL-10 gene promoter between patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and healthy individuals, associating the frequency of polymorphisms with different aspects of viral infection. This is a case-control study with 260 patients who were infected with HCV and 260 healthy individuals. Genotyping of the polymorphisms was performed using the technique of amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR) for regions of the IL-10 gene promoter (-1082 G/A, -819 C/T, -592 C/A). The frequencies of alleles and genotypes related to polymorphisms in the IL-10 gene promoter showed a higher frequency of the G allele and genotype GG in the -1082 region between the infected group and the control group (p=0.005 and p=0.001, respectively), whereas the AA genotype was significantly more frequent in the control group. The frequencies of the haplotypes GTA and GCC were higher in the group of infected individuals, whereas the haplotype ATA was more frequent in the healthy group (p<0.006). It was also observed that the genotypes GG and AG in the region -1082 were significantly more frequent among patients infected with HCV who were in advanced stages of fibrosis and cirrhosis (p=0.042). No association was observed between polymorphisms of IL-10 and sustained virologic response (SVR). "
1353,0.005,1.0000,"A 29-year-old Ghanaian woman who developed AIDS while being HIV-antibody seronegative was investigated during a collaborative study aimed at the identification of viral causes of a HIV-seronegative AIDS syndrome in West Africa. Plasma was screened with a panel of EIA tests for antibodies to HIV and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Retroviral infection was investigated by detection of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in plasma, viral RNA amplification and quantification, and virus isolation. Positive amplification products were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were carried out. Most EIA tests were unable to demonstrate the presence of anti-HIV anti-bodies, whereas confirmatory assays yielded inconclusive results. Retroviral infection was documented by detection of RT activity, HIV-1-specific genomic amplification and virus isolation. This virus was HIV-1 subtype A with an unusual six amino acid insertion in the gp120 V4 loop and with the nef gene of subtype G. The patient's plasma did not react with either autologous or heterologous viral lysates or HIV-1 peptides, whereas antibodies to other viral antigens were present. In conclusion, the Ghanaian patient exhibited a rare subtype A/G recombinant HIV-1 infection with a near absence of a HIV-specific humoral response. The lack of detectable antibody response might be due to either a highly pathogenic, rapidly fatal, HIV-1 infection preventing the development of the typical humoral immune response or to a host-related dysfunction of the immune system. Direct antigenemia or genomic detection of the virus should be undertaken when clinical or biological data suggests an HIV infection in the absence of serological evidence."

This study investigated the prevalence and pattern of MHR mutations in North China and the clinical correlations of these mutations. The MHRs of 161 HBsAg-positive patients were amplified using nested PCR, and directly sequenced to identify MHR mutations. It was showed that among the 161 patients infected with HBV genotype C in North China, the overall frequency of MHR mutation was 46.6%. Furthermore, MHR mutations were associated with high white blood cell counts (P = 0.025), high bilirubin levels (P = 0.048), and cirrhosis (P = 0.010). The most frequent mutations in patients with both HBsAg-positive and anti-HBs-positive were located in subregion 1 and 3 of MHR, specifically, residue Q101 (29.9%) and I126 (70.6%), which was different from the mutation pattern found in Western Europe and the United States. Taken together, these data indicated important virological and clinical aspects of HBV evolution in terms of the surface gene of genotype C, which might be important for its response to the currently available HBV vaccine."

The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with TDR mutations defined according to the list of the World Health Organization was investigated among 53 therapy-naïve persons with confirmed recent HIV-1 infection diagnosed in Poland, in the years 2008-2010. Proviral DNA was amplified, sequenced, and screened for the TDR mutations in the pol gene fragments coding for the whole protease and the initial 256 residues of the reverse transcriptase. The frequency of sequences with at least one TDR mutation was 11.3%. In four (7.5%) sequences at least one resistance mutation related to reverse transcriptase inhibitors was identified, and in further two (3.8%) sequences one mutation related to protease inhibitors' resistance was present. The moderate rate of TDR highlights the need for a continuous surveillance and resistance testing among treatment-naïve individuals to optimize treatment effects within a country. "
1206,0.005,1.0000,"The HIV-1 genetic variability in Bahia state, Brazil, was investigated. DNA samples from 229 and 213 HIV-1-infected individuals were analyzed using the heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) in gag and env fragments, respectively. One hundred seventy-five samples were characterized in both genes. Thirty-two subtype F and BF recombinant viruses were sequenced and analyzed by phylogenetic methods. The combination of HMA and sequencing results showed that seven different HIV-1 genotypes comprised this sample: 147 (84%) B/B, 4 (2.3%) F/F, 3 (1.7%) B/F, 1 (0.6%) F/B, 1 (0.6%) F/D, 1 (0.6%) BF/F, and 18 (10.3%) BF/B. A significant divergence was observed between these two techniques results (84.4%). This is explained by the low accuracy of the HMA for detecting recombinant viruses. These recombinants were unrelated to CRF12, while two sequences were related to CRF28 and CRF29. Nineteen BF mosaics shared the same gag breakpoint. In conclusion, the use of HMA may be inappropriate in regions where different subtypes are co-circulating. Subtype B is the most common genotype, however, an increased prevalence (13.1%) of different BF variants and a potentially new CRF suggest that recombination is occurring frequently in Bahia. These viruses were associated with women infected heterosexually. Finally, this study identified the presence of an F/D recombinant HIV-1 in Brazil."
6453,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the effectiveness of currently available human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) therapies, a continuing need exists for new drugs to treat HIV-1 infection. We investigated the mechanism by which 3-O-[3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl]-betulinic acid (DSB) inhibits HIV-1 replication. DSB functions at a late stage of the virus life cycle but does not inhibit the HIV-1 protease in vitro or interfere with virus assembly or release. DSB specifically delays the cleavage of Gag between the capsid (CA) and p2, resulting in delayed formation of the mature viral core and reduced HIV-1 infectivity. Replication of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) was resistant to DSB; however, a chimeric SIV carrying CA-p2 sequences from HIV-1 was inhibited by the drug, indicating that susceptibility to DSB maps to the CA-p2 region of the HIV-1 Gag protein. A single point mutation at the CA-p2 cleavage site of HIV-1 conferred strong resistance to DSB, confirming the target of the drug. HIV-1 strains that are resistant to a variety of protease inhibitors were sensitive to DSB. These findings indicate that DSB specifically protects the CA-p2 cleavage site from processing by the viral protease during virion maturation, thereby revealing a novel mechanism for pharmacologic inhibition of HIV-1 replication."

The recognition of the HLA-DQ-restricted epitope by this clone was further defined by using overlapping synthetic peptides. The epitope recognized by this CD4+ CTL clone (amino acids 140 to 148) overlaps with a CD8+ epitope and is highly conserved among all isolates of HIV type 1 that have been sequenced.

The protease inhibitors studied were Ro 31-8959, A-77003, XM323, L-735,524, and VX-478. Resistant variants with two to four mutations within their protease sequence and 9- to 40-fold-decreased susceptibility were selected for all five inhibitors within six to eight passes in cell culture. Passage of a zidovudine-resistant mutant in Ro 31-8959 generated a dual reverse transcriptase- and protease-resistant virus. Variants were cloned directly into a modified pHXB2-D infectious clone for cross-resistance analysis. Although the resistant variants selected possessed different combinations of protease mutations for each inhibitor, many showed cross-resistance to the other inhibitors, and one showed cross-resistance to all five inhibitors. Interestingly, some mutants showed increased susceptibility to some inhibitors. Further HIV passage studies in the combined presence of two protease inhibitors demonstrated that in vitro it was possible to delay significantly selection of mutations producing resistance to one or both inhibitors. These studies indicate that there may be some rationale for combining different protease inhibitors as well as protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors in HIV combination therapy."
2604,0.005,1.0000,"It has become clear that the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome follows continuous replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a decrease in immune capability, most obviously a decline in the number of CD4 lymphocytes. An understanding of key elements in the infectious life cycle of HIV has led to the development of potent antiretroviral drugs selectively targeting unique reverse transcriptase and protease enzymes of the virus. Completed clinical trials have shown that antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection, begun early, reduces viral replication and reverses the decline in CD4 lymphocyte numbers. Recent studies of combination therapies have shown that decreases in plasma HIV viremia to low levels and sustained increases in CD4 cell numbers are associated with longer survival. Potent combination regimens including protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors suppress detectable viral replication and have demonstrated clinical benefits in patients with advanced disease. Progress in antiretroviral therapy and methods to monitor responses to treatment are providing new hope in the treatment of HIV infection."
5999,0.005,1.0000,"A recent addition to the lymphokine network is human IL-10 (hIL-10). This novel lymphokine has striking homology to BCRF1 protein, the product of a previously uncharacterized open-reading frame in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome. To date, IL-10 expression has been described in several T clones induced with anti-CD3 and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), in monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and in murine B-cell lymphomas. We sought to determine whether human B cells express hIL-10 and, if so, its relationship to EBV and to other B-cell lymphokines. We studied 21 EBV-positive B-cell lines derived from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and Burkitt's lymphoma (n = 6), American Burkitt's (n = 3), African Burkitt's (n = 5), and normal lymphoblastoid cell lines (n = 7), in comparison with seven EBV-negative cell lines. All cell lines were activated with the tumor promoters PMA and teleocidin and were studied by Northern blot analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). We demonstrated that EBV-positive cell lines derived from patients with American Burkitt's lymphoma, and especially those from patients with AIDS, constitutively express large quantities of hIL-10 by Northern blot analysis and ELISA (range, 3,101 to 25,915 pg/mL), and that both teleocidin and PMA induce hIL-10 in these cell lines. In contrast, six of seven EBV-negative cell lines did not express hIL-10 even by RT-PCR, and hIL-10 was not triggered by PMA or teleocidin. To assure that the 350 bp amplified by PCR was hIL-10 and not BCRF1, we used PCR primers, which do not amplify a fragment from plasmid templates containing BCRF1. Cloning and sequencing of the 350 bp product also demonstrated that B-cell IL-10 is identical to hIL-10 from the T-cell clone B21. Correlation of hIL-10 with other B-cell lymphokines secreted by these B-cell lines demonstrated that hIL-10 secretor cell lines also constitutively secrete or can be induced to secrete IL-6, although to a much lesser amount. Since both lymphokines influence B-cell growth and differentiation, we suggest that hIL-10 may contribute to the polyclonal B-cell activation and hyperglobulinemia seen in AIDS patients. Finally, several reports support the hypothesis that EBV is an important cofactor in the development of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-related B-cell lymphomas. Detection of large quantities of hIL-10 in B-cell lines derived from AIDS patients, the close association between EBV and hIL-10 shown in this report, and the ability of BCRF1 to capture hIL-10 activities, make hIL-10/BCRF1 an attractive candidate as a factor causing B-cell growth and immortalization in patients with AIDS and B-cell lymphomas."

Urgently needed are both a vaccine to prevent infection with the etiologic retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and safe, effective antiviral agents to treat those individuals already infected. The elucidation of viral replicative mechanisms has allowed the development and testing of several agents active against HIV in vitro. Inhibitors of reverse transcriptase that have demonstrated activity include azidothymidine, phosphonoformate, antimoniotungstate (HPA-23), and suramin. Ribavirin and recombinant interferon alpha-A (IFN-alpha-A) also inhibit HIV replication, although their mechanisms of action are less clear. All of these compounds are undergoing early clinical trials in patients with HIV infection. The identification of immunogenic viral proteins may allow the development of one or more subunit vaccines against HIV. Studies are underway to clone appropriate viral genes and incorporate the expressed proteins into vectors for administration. Laboratory models, e.g., chimpanzees, will be inoculated with candidate vaccines and, if successful, this will be followed by clinical trials for safety and efficacy in appropriate human populations seronegative for HIV. Although important problems, such as virus envelope protein variability, need to be addressed, efforts to develop effective vaccines may well prove successful in the years ahead."

PreS1, and a 27 amino acid active peptide inside preS1 (preS1ap), are supposed to be the molecules that the human hepatitis B virus (HBV) needs to bind specifically to hepatocytes. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the gC:preS1ap fusion molecule was expressed and incorporated into the envelope of the recombinant HSV-1 virus KgBpK(-)gC:preS1ap. Moreover, KgBpK(-)gC:preS1ap recombinant virus gained a specific binding activity to an hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) with a consequent productive infection. In addition, anti-preS1-specific antibodies were shown to neutralize recombinant virus infectivity, and a synthetic preS1ap peptide was able to elute KgBpK(-)gC:preS1ap virus bound on HpeG2 cells. These data provide further evidence that HSV-1 can productively infect cells through a specific binding to a non-HSV-1 receptor. Furthermore, these data strongly support the hypothesis that the HBV preS1ap molecule is an HBV ligand to hepatocytes."

In vivo the inhibition of HCV replication by statins has not been demonstrated. We evaluated in this open-label, randomized controlled study the efficacy of fluvastatin as adjuvant to pegylated-(PEG)-IFN and ribavirin in HIV/HCV genotype 1 co-infected patients."
9711,0.005,1.0000,"Dementia is a common complication of AIDS which is associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of brain macrophages and microglia. Recent studies have shown that astrocytes are also infected in the brain but HIV-1 replication in these cells is restricted. To determine virus specificity of this restriction we tested the expression of 15 HIV-1 molecular clones in primary human fetal astrocytes by infection and DNA transfection. Infection with cell-free viruses was poorly productive and revealed no clone-specific differences. In contrast, transfected cells produced transiently high levels of HIV-1 p24 core antigen, up to 50 nanograms per ml culture supernatant, and nanogram levels of p24 were detected 3-4 weeks after transfection of some viral clones. The average peak expression of HIV-1 in astrocytes varied as a function of viral clone used by a factor of 15 but the differences and the subsequent virus spread did not correlate with the tropism of the viral clones to T cells or macrophages. Functional vif, vpu, and vpr genes were dispensable for virus replication from transfected DNA, but intact nef provided a detectable enhancement of early viral gene expression and promoted maintenance of HIV-1 infection. We conclude that primary astrocytes present no fundamental barriers to moderate expression of different strains of HIV-1 and that the presence of functional Nef is advantageous to virus infection in these cells."
929,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with a lysine-to-arginine substitution at codon 65 (HIV-1(65R)) of reverse transcriptase (RT) can rapidly emerge in patients being treated with specific combinations of nucleoside analog RT inhibitors (NRTIs). A better understanding of the activity of approved and investigational NRTIs against HIV-1(65R) is needed to select optimal therapy for patients infected with this mutant and to devise strategies to prevent its emergence. Therefore, we tested a broad panel of NRTIs that differed by enantiomer, pseudosugar, and base component against HIV-1(65R) to determine how NRTI structure affects activity. Drug susceptibilities of recombinant wild-type (HIV-1(65K)) or mutant HIV-1(65R) were determined using a single-replication-cycle susceptibility assay with P4/R5 cells and/or a multiple-replication-cycle susceptibility assay with MT-2 cells. All D, L, and acyclic NRTIs were significantly less active against HIV-1(65R) than against HIV-1(65K) except for analogs containing a 3'-azido moiety. Pseudosugar structure and base component but not enantiomer influenced NRTI activity against HIV-1(65R). These findings support the inclusion of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine in drug combinations to treat patients having HIV-1(65R) and to prevent its emergence."
7768,0.005,1.0000,"The safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea with didanosine in combination with stavudine in nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-experienced patients was investigated. Entry criteria included HIV-1 infected, NRTI-experienced adults, with CD4(+) counts 50-550 cells/mm(3) and viral loads >or=12,500 copies/mL. Subjects were treated with didanosine 200 mg twice a day (BID), stavudine 40 mg BID, and hydroxyurea 1000 mg daily for 16 weeks. Thirty-one HIV-1 subjects with mean bDNA viral load 1x10(5) log(10) copies/mL and mean CD4(+) T-cell counts of 231 cells/mm(3) were enrolled. A 1.3 log(10) decrease in mean viral load was seen at 12 weeks of therapy. Prior didanosine use resulted in a more rapid response to therapy compared with prior zidovudine use. Side effects consisting of neutropenia, pancreatitis, and peripheral neuropathy occurred in four subjects and resolved upon withdrawal of therapy. This non-randomized study in subjects with a mean CD4(+) T-cell count of 230 cells/mm(3) demonstrates the antiviral activity of hydroxyurea+didanosine and stavudine. Toxicities related to therapy need to be followed closely. The results support the need for a randomized, prospective study to determine the safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea plus didanosine in antiretroviral-experienced patients with CD4(+) cell counts below 300 cells/mm(3)."
5397,0.005,1.0000,"Lipoatrophy (LA)/lipodystrophy and nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-associated syndrome are of central importance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) care. Neither of these conditions has had a clear pathogenesis or biomarker defined for early detection, prevention research, or patient management. I describe the recent development of kinetic biomarkers for LA and mitochondrial toxicity that involve the measurement of biosynthetic fluxes rather than static concentrations of molecules. The turnover of adipose-tissue components (lipids and cells) and tissue mitochondrial DNA is measured by the incorporation of deuterium from heavy water, using mass spectrometry. Preliminary results in animal models and humans, including the effects of NRTIs on mitochondrial DNA synthesis in rats and adipose-tissue lipid kinetics in HIV-associated LA, are reviewed. The results suggest that the kinetics of adipose-tissue components and mitochondrial DNA are measurable in vivo and that these measurements may prove useful as clinical biomarkers in patients with HIV/AIDS."
9646,0.005,1.0000,"In an effort to define immunobiological parameters identifying ""responders"" vs ""non-responders"" to IFN among hepatitis patients, 16 patients with chronic active hepatitis were screened for changes of Natural Killer cell activity (NK). 10/16 patients replicated the hepatitis B virus (HBV-DNA positive) whereas 6/16 replicated the defective B virus associated delta virus (HDV-RNA positive). Patients received 9 MU/3x/weekly/3 months of recombinant IFN alpha A. Mean NK activity of the HBV-DNA patients rose significantly from 29.9 +/- 5.3 to 45 +/- 4.7 during therapy, whereas the 6/16 HDV-RNA positive patients did not show any significant increase of NK activity. Interestingly, individual HDV-RNA positive patients exhibiting boosted NK activity also showed improvement of disease confirmed by clearance of intrahepatic delta antigen at one year. No such a correlation was found amongst the HBV-DNA positive patients. These data indicate that in spite of widespread individual variability, IFN-mediated NK boost may herald delta clearance and help in identifying ""responders"" and ""non-responders"" in IFN trials."
5970,0.005,1.0000,"Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication, but are often associated with mitochondrial toxicity. Although well studied outside of the central nervous system, no investigation has examined the effects of these drugs on brain mitochondria of individuals living with HIV. The authors used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to evaluate NRTI-related changes in brain mitochondria. N-acetylaspartate (NAA; sensitive to alterations in mitochondrial integrity) was measured in frontal lobe white and gray matter of 18 HIV+ individuals taking didanosine and/or stavudine (two NRTIs likely to cause mitochondrial toxicity), 14 HIV+ individuals taking zidovudine and lamivudine, 16 HIV+ individuals not currently taking antiretrovirals, and 17 HIV- controls. The HIV+ groups were comparable on demographic measures, estimates of illness severity, and estimated length of HIV infection. Those taking didanosine and/or stavudine had a significant 11.4% decrease in concentrations of frontal white matter NAA compared to HIV- controls, whereas NAA levels of the other HIV+ groups were intermediate. Group differences in metabolites were not found in frontal gray matter. Lower levels of frontal white matter NAA were associated with longer periods of didanosine and/or stavudine treatment (r = -.41, P = .06). Levels of NAA were not related to length of zidovudine/lamivudine treatment (r = -.04, P = .44). Furthermore, taking more than one of stavudine, didanosine, and abacavir increased the likelihood of having reduced NAA. The results are consistent with previous studies finding HIV-related changes in neuronal integrity. However, because NRTIs can injure mitochondria, we propose that the observed reductions in NAA in individuals taking didanosine and/or stavudine may be the result of depleted brain mitochondria and/or alterations in cellular respiration. Measurement of brain metabolites sensitive to impairments in energy metabolism, including NAA, may aid in early detection of subclinical NRTI-mediated mitochondrial toxicity."
4023,0.005,1.0000,"The number of HIV-infected individuals with prior multiple treatment failures is increasing as time passes by. The success of antiretroviral therapy in these patients is often compromised by the selection of drug-resistant viruses. Despite initial concerns, a rebound in AIDS cases among heavily treatment-experienced patients failing virologically their antiretroviral therapy has not occurred yet. In a multicenter study conducted in Spain, HIV-infected patients were assessed with prior failure to antiretrovirals from the three main drug families who presented during the last semester of the year 2003 with plasma HIV-RNA values above 1,000 copies/ml, despite good treatment adherence. The relationships between CD4+ T cell counts, viral loads and drug-resistant genotypes were examined. A total of 273 patients were identified in 12 centers (78% male, median age: 41 years). The mean viral load was 50,438 copies/ml and the mean CD4+ count was 328 cells/mul. Only 19.5% had less than 200 CD4+ T cells/mul. Most patients (95%) were receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) in their last antiretroviral regimen, while 63% were treated with protease inhibitors (PI) and 27% on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Overall, 97.4% had at least one drug resistance mutation (87.2% for NRTI, 68.5% for NNRTI, and 92.7% for PI). Using the virtual phenotype, resistance to three or more drugs within each class was recognized in 45.8% for NRTI, 40.7% for NNRTI, and 44.7% for PI. Moreover, cross-resistance to compounds from two or three drug families was recognized in 41% and 19.4% of patients, respectively. Nearly half of the patients had plasma HIV-RNA below 10,000 copies/ml and they showed significantly higher CD4 + counts than those with greater viremia (408 versus 259 cells/mul; P < 0.001). Patients with higher plasma viremia had significantly more drug resistance mutations than those with lower viremia. No favorable effect on viral load could be recognized for individual drug resistance mutations known to reduce viral fitness in vitro (i.e., rtM184V, rtL74V, rtK65R, proD30N, or proI50L). In summary, a large proportion of treatment-experienced patients failing their current antiretroviral regimen carry viruses with broad cross-resistant genotypes. Nearly half of the patients with these multi-drug resistant viruses had < 10,000 HIV-RNA copies/ml and 80% have more than 200 CD4 + T cells/mul. Thus, maintaining treatment HIV-infected individuals failing virologically and harboring drug-resistant viruses might ameliorate immunological deterioration until new drugs became available. J. Med.

5491,0.005,1.0000,"Virus load based on levels of functional reverse transcriptase (RT) was measured in plasma from 50 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected persons, in 87 samples from 10 HIV-1 seroconversion panels, and in 100 uninfected persons by use of Amp-RT, an ultrasensitive RT assay. Of the 50 clinical samples, 38 (76%) were Amp-RT positive, while all uninfected controls were negative. Pearson's correlation coefficient of RNA and RT levels was .73 for all samples, .86 for seroconversion samples, and .49 for clinical samples. Calculated ratios of RT activity to virion RNA varied widely during both early and late stages of infection. Mean RT:RNA ratios in 8 seroconversion panels and in 12 (34.3%) of 35 individual clinical samples were significantly lower than the ratio for a reference virus. However, ratios were stable in individual seroconversions over time. These data demonstrate that RT activity can be used to quantitate plasma virus load and provide evidence of different levels of virion-associated RT among HIV-1-infected persons."
6441,0.005,1.0000,"In this pilot study, we address the nature of the re-population of the T-cell compartment in HIV-1+ (Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1), vertically infected children placed on successful regimens of HAART (highly active anti-retroviral therapy) incorporating 2 NRTI and a protease inhibitor. The clonality of the T-cell compartment and the abundance of RTEs (Recent Thymic Emigrants) were determined 2 weeks before and 20 weeks after initiation of HAART in a subgroup of children taking part in the PENTA (Paediatric European Network for the Treatment of AIDS) 5 trial. Analysis of the clonality of the circulating T-cell compartment was assessed using CDR3 spectratyping and analysed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two sample test. This revealed that a high degree of T-cell clonal restriction still exists 5 months into therapy, despite the appearance of previously undetectable T-cell clones within the periphery. We detected no increase in RTE abundance in this 5 month period, as determined by PCR detection of TRECs (T-Cell Receptor Excision Circles). We conclude that the observed re-population of T cells within the periphery of treated children is heavily reliant upon the maintenance/expansion of pre-existing cells during the 5 month period immediately following the initiation of therapy."
