7098,0.03,6.0000,"Only some twenty years has passed since the first discovery of severe immunodeficiency among previously healthy homosexual men through the discovery of the causing virus and till the status today where the knowledge on the HIV virus and the pathogenic mechanisms induced by the virus are extensive, though still incomplete. Furthermore, steadily better treatments have been introduced at a paste that is probably without precedents. These processes have been fuelled by various molecular biological methods. The abilities to quantify viremia and to sequence virus and hence describe the evolution of the virus represent valuable tools for understanding the pathogenic processes. The current thesis describes some of the findings obtained. While it was initially thought that the virological profile mimicked the clinical with an acute infection followed for years by clinical latency and only after on average ten years signs of severe immunodeficiency, this understanding has been revised. There is no virological latency. The viral replication is on going throughout the infection. However, the virological profile does resemble the clinical. Viremia is high shortly after infection; hereafter declines, and stabilises around what has been termed the viral set point. This level of viremia is predictive of the clinical course of the infection. We have shown that the viremic levels, measured both as HIV RNA load and proviral DNA load, early in infection carry significant information about the course of the infection. It is; however, not only early viral loads that carry prognostic information, also viral load during late-stage infection is clinically informative. Viral load measurements have evolved as the major tool for monitoring the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy. HIV RNA has been shown to be a good surrogate marker for the clinical efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. How to use the measurements most optimally has however not been fully delineated. Various methods for describing virological response might yield different results, and it is recommended that the pros and cons of the various methods be investigated. In a cohort of patients who had obtained good virological suppression on antiretroviral therapy followed prospectively for two years we found that only few patients experienced high-grade viremia. Furthermore, baseline HIV DNA differed between the patients with various longitudinal HIV RNA profiles. The patients with the most pronounced HIV RNA suppression had lowest proviral load at baseline, with a clear gradient across the groups. The interplay between proviral load and treatment response deserves further investigations. Resistance can develop against all the available antiretrovirals. The high turnover rate of HIV along with the error-prone reverse transcriptase leads to the possibility of steady accumulation of resistance mutations if the viremic suppression is incomplete. While the interplay between viremia and resistance development is clear-cut for some antiretrovirals i.e. Lamivudine, the pattern is more complex for i.e. Zidovudine. With the availability of assays for resistances testing the knowledge on this issue has been ever evolving. How to use resistance testing in the clinical monitoring of patients remains to be clarified. Resistance testing can aid in the process of choosing salvage therapy for patients experiencing virological failure. Whether resistance testing will be of clinical benefit in other situations remains to be determined. Investigation of the viral sequences and evolution herein has not only been used for resistance analyses, but also for tracing the spread of the infection. HIV-1 exists in many subtypes, with various geographic distributions. Hence subtype analyses have been used to investigate the introduction and spread of the HIV infection into many countries. Phylogenetic analyses have also been used to investigate nosocomial transmission events. We used analyses of env and gag sequences to trace a case of nosocomial infection at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Denmark. The study underlines the importance of steady awareness of the infection control precautions and possible breaks herein. The usefulness of this type of analyses was confirmed. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic various replicative patterns were described. Virus obtained from patients with late-stage infection often had virus that could induce syncytium formation (SI) when cultured, while virus obtained from patients in the early stages of infection did not have this ability. A correlation between the SI ability and the ability to yield high virus titres rapidly as well as the ability to establish infection in certain cell lines was found. Patients infected with SI virus experience more rapid clinical deterioration. We found that patients harbouring SI virus have HIV RNA loads no different from patients harbouring NSI virus. This is in line with the findings of other groups. Though patients harbouring SI virus had a more rapid development of resistance when treated with nucleoside reserve transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI's) monotherapy, this was not the case when treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HAART is today considered the treatment modality of choice; both for established HIV-infection and in cases where post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is given in order to prevent establishment of infection after exposure. In a case of transfusion of HIV-contaminated though HIV antibody negative blood the recipient was treated with HAART. As the risk of infection is close to 100% under these circumstances the fact that the recipient remained uninfected is probably attributable to the prompt initiation and thorough maintenance of PEP. PEP is recommended to health care workers after percutaneous HIV exposure as well as after sexual exposure. Even with NRTI monotherapy PEP has been shown to be efficacious. While the explanation for the dichotomy (SI vs. NSI) was for many years unresolved, it is now known that this is due to the requirements of the virus for different co-receptors for cell entry. SI virus uses mainly CXCR4 while NSI virus uses CCR5. Being heterozygous for a 32 basepair deletion in the gene encoding CCR5 leads to slower disease progression. We have shown that heterozygotes have lower HIV RNA levels in the early years of the infection, possibly explaining the clinical advantage of having the deletion. HIV replicates in activated cells, and there is an intriguing interplay between HIV replication and immune activation. HIV-infected patients have elevated levels of immunoglobulins. HIV induces polygonal immunoglobulin production. We found that patients experiencing good virological suppression of HAART had lower IgA levels than patients with less complete viral suppression. Whether IgA can be used as a marker for imminent viral break-through remains to be determined. The full understanding of the interplay between immune activation and HIV replication awaits further studies. The finding of increased viremia in conjunction with acute bacterial or viral infection led to concerns about the safety of vaccinating HIV-infected patients against influenza and pneumococcal infection. We found no difference in HIV RNA levels measured before and median 42 days after anti-pneumococcal vaccination. This is in line with many other studies showing either no or only transient increases in viremia. In conclusion, the knowledge on HIV virology has expanded tremendously. This has led to significant improvements in treatments in the Western World leading to declines in HIV morbidity and mortality. The ability to quantify viral load and to perform sequence analyses represent valuable tools both for understanding the pathogenic actions of the virus and for the clinical monitoring of HIV-infected patients. The optimal usage of these tools in the clinical setting, however, still remains to be defined. The progresses obtained have unfortunately been restricted to the Western World and the calamities of HIV is spreading and worsening in the Developing World. The progress in the development of a vaccine has been disappointing and it is urgently necessary that the progresses obtained within the fields of prevention and treatment are translated into useful strategies in the parts of the world mostly affected by the HIV pandemic."
8225,0.025,5.0000,"HIV-1 evolution and the possible emergence of mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral inhibitors have been evaluated in a cohort of sixty-three patients successfully treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The patients under effective HAART were recruited in three different hospitals in Spain, and none of them had been treated (na√Øve) before entering this study. HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined, and nucleotide sequences of proviral regions encoding protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) were obtained for longitudinal blood samples spanning a mean follow-up period of 88 weeks. Phylogenetic reconstructions and calculations of genetic distances among the different sequences of each patient were performed. All except one of the patients under study showed an early and sustained decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA to levels that were below 200 copies/ml. The plasma viral decline paralleled a significant increase in the CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. Amino acid sequence analyses revealed the occurrence of mutations associated with antiretroviral resistance in nine patients (14.3%) during HAART treatment, that in some cases could be attributed to excess G to A transitions. In six of the nine patients, the mutations conferred resistance to inhibitors administered in the treatment regime, although the mutations did not result in treatment failure. Sequence comparisons revealed viral evolution during the period of treatment in 47.5% of the patients. The results indicate successful suppression of HIV-1 under HAART for extended time periods, indistinguishable for patients in which evidence of virus evolution could or could not be documented."
5219,0.025,5.0000,"Important progress has been made in recent years in the development and clinical use of drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Nevertheless, when antiretroviral therapy fails to be fully suppressive, new viral variants emerge, thus allowing HIV-1 to escape from drug pressure by accumulating mutations. Between 50% and 70% of treated patients with virological rebound harbour some form of drug-resistant virus; transmitted drug resistance in drug-na√Øve populations has reached 5-20% in areas of the world with access to treatment. The emergence of drug-resistant viruses remains the limiting factor in HIV-1 management, being a major cause of treatment failure, and being associated with clinical progression and death. All international guidelines focus on the importance of tailoring antiretroviral therapy to the individual patient, on the basis onf HIV-1 genetic data, integrated with clinical, laboratory and therapeutic information. The aim of this review is to provide useful information to clinicians and virologists about how and when to use genotypic resistance testing in clinical practice, especially in the management of the first stages of HIV-1 patient care and treatment decisions."
5542,0.025,5.0000,"Introduction of antiretroviral combination therapy has profoundly altered both the course and prognosis of the disease in HIV-infected persons. Indeed, protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral combination therapy dramatically decreased morbidity and mortality and improved quality of life of HIV-infected persons. Recent data, however, have raised concerns that antiretroviral combination therapy is associated with premature manifestation of coronary artery disease. In particular, protease inhibitors have been linked to metabolic changes such as insulin resistance, abnormalities in lipid metabolism and lipodystrophy and increased coronary artery calcification. Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions whether the incidence of myocardial infarction is indeed increased in this patient population. The most substantial database has recently been provided by the D:A:D study group who demonstrated an increased incidence of myocardial infarction in HIV-infected persons on protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-containing therapy in a prospective observational cohort study. Much about the mechanisms involved leading to this finding remain elusive. Surrogate markers such as endothelial function may help to delineate potential mechanisms. Endothelial dysfunction is a key event in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease. It is characterized by decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Furthermore endothelial ""activation"" leading to a pro-inflammatory, proliferative and prothrombotic state of the endothelium occurs. The observed accelerated atherosclerosis could either be caused by the virus infection itself or by a side effect of antiretroviral therapy, protease inhibitors in particular. Experimental studies demonstrate a direct impact of viral components (gp120, TAT) on the endothelium, as they lead to expression of adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM], E-selectin), a prothrombotic state (increase of von Willebrand factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-[PAI-]1, tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA], tissue factor). In addition, soluble adhesion molecules (sE-selectin, ICAM) were found to be increased in HIV-infected persons. Impaired flow-mediated dilation can already be detected in HIV-infected children, independent of antiretroviral therapy. Another study showed a correlation between viral load and flow-mediated dilation, supporting the notion of infection/inflammation as a contributor to endothelial dysfunction. The influence of protease inhibitor therapy on the endothelium was investigated in several studies in vitro and in vivo. In experimental studies certain protease inhibitors downregulated eNOS expression, and induced CD36 scavenger receptor expression. Furthermore, apoptosis, radical oxygen species (ROS), proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelin-1 were found to be increased. There is conflicting evidence about adhesion molecules, as some investigators detected a decrease by therapy, others did not see an effect. In clinical studies all but one investigator found endothelial function to be impaired in HIV-infected persons on protease inhibitor-containing regimens. An important study to underline the hypothesis of a link between protease inhibitor therapy comes from Dub√© et al. showing that in healthy volunteers, indinavir caused impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation after 4 weeks. In a wide variety of clinical conditions lipid-lowering therapy using statins has shown to improve endothelial function as well as hard clinical endpoints. Drug interactions caused by common metabolism of protease inhibitors and most statins by the P450 3A4 pathway limit the use of these drugs it this setting. Pravastatin, which is being metabolized independently of P450 enzymes, was tested in several studies. In one study a trend toward improvement of endothelial function was observed. In an own similar study the authors recently provided evidence of a significant improvement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in 30 HIV-infected persons. These studies support current guidelines of treating protease inhibitor-associated dyslipidemia with statins, preferably pravastatin.. Many questions remain unanswered in the context of antiretroviral therapy and cardiovascular risk. Results gained from research of endothelial function have served to delineate certain potential mechanisms, much work is yet to be done."
2120,0.02,4.0000,"Mutations in the precore region of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been associated with failure of expression of HBV e-antigen (HBeAg), however, the prevalence of these and other mutations in HBV carriers without overt chronic liver disease remains uncertain. Homosexual or bisexual males (n = 65) with chronic HBV infection attending The Middlesex Hospital, London were studied, of whom two had clinical evidence of chronic liver disease. HBV DNA was amplified from 62 of 65 serum samples using nested and double nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Direct sequencing of the PCR products was employed to investigate sequence variation. HBV-DNA from all available HBeAg-negative (n = 9) and selected HBeAg-positive (n = 33) sera were sequenced in the entire precore gene, the 3' terminal portion of the X gene (aa128-154), and the 5' terminus of the core gene (aa18-73). Sequences were highly conserved in all regions studied. Samples from two anti-HBe-seropositive patients contained mutations in the precore region. In one, a single mutation in the first amino acid resulted in a change to leucine, which would prevent translation of this region and therefore HBeAg expression. Wild type sequences were also detected in this sample. In the other sample from a patient with overt chronic liver disease, a mutation of precore amino acid 28 changed a tryptophan residue to a stop codon which would also prevent HBeAg expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7107,0.015,3.0000,"Development of drug resistance is the inevitable consequence of incomplete suppression of virus plasma levels in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy. Resistance mutations previously characterized have been found in B subtype viruses of developed countries. Moreover, mutation profiles for non-B and more divergent B subtype viruses found in developing countries shall be analyzed together with their ex vivo phenotyping in order to establish an exact correlation between the genotyping data and the clinical management counseling for those uncommon virus subtypes. In the present study, we evaluated the mutation profile for individuals infected with B subtype and non-B subtype viruses. Viral DNA fragments corresponding to the RT gene were amplified, sequenced, and subtyped. Phenotyping analysis for reverse transcriptase nucleoside (NRTI) and nonnucleoside inhibitor susceptibility was performed using the recombinant virus assay technology. Brazilian non-B subtypes (subtype F, n = 4, and subtype A, n = 1) isolates showed essentially the same B subtype mutation profile, presenting an NRTI drug resistance with similar MIC50% and MIC90% values for all drugs analyzed regardless of their subtypes. A strong cross-resistance phenotype among AZT, 3TC, and abacavir could be seen in all isolates analyzed. A novel result was that some RT sequences not only revealed the presence of G333D/E mutations but also correlated to the presence of mutation T386I that could abrogate the M184V-surpassing effect of L210W or L210W plus G333D/E. These findings suggest that Brazilian non-B subtype HIV-1 strains use an identical RT drug resistance mutation pattern when compared to B isolates and will contribute to the validation of the genotypic and phenotypic tests in these predominant worldwide-spread viral variants."
9648,0.015,3.0000,"Cigarette smoking among people living with HIV/AIDS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but findings regarding the association between cigarette smoking and HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts have been inconsistent. This study characterized the prevalence of cigarette smoking among HIV-infected Russian women and examined the association between smoking frequency and quantity and HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. HIV-infected Russian women (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ250; M age‚Äâ=‚Äâ30.0) in St.¬†Petersburg, Russia, completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview survey assessing cigarette use, antiretroviral medication adherence, and provided blood samples assayed for HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. The majority (60.4%) reported cigarette smoking in the past month; 49.0% of recent smokers were classified as moderate or heavy smokers, defined as smoking ‚â•10 cigarettes daily. Viral load status did not differ between infrequent smokers and regular smokers. However, moderate/heavy smokers (relative to light smokers) were more likely to have a detectable viral load (AOR‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.1). There were no significant differences in CD4+ lymphocyte counts by smoking frequency or quantity of cigarettes smoked. Results highlight the need for additional research to examine the association between cigarette smoking and virologic suppression and markers of HIV disease progression. Adverse health consequences of cigarette smoking coupled with a potential link between heavy smoking and poor virologic suppression highlight the need for assessment of cigarette use and provision of evidence-based smoking-cessation interventions within HIV medical care."
9242,0.015,3.0000,"Antiretroviral medications are effective at improving the health and increasing the survival of people living with HIV/AIDS. However, studies have shown that a substantial number of HIV-infected people do not receive antiretroviral treatments. The current study examined the physical and mental health, substance use, and perceptions of medical care of 163 men and 78 women living with HIV/AIDS. Results of a confidential survey showed that 79 (33%) were not currently treated for HIV. These persons did not differ from those who were treated in chart-abstracted CD4 cell counts, years living with HIV infection, HIV-related symptoms, and HIV-related hospitalizations. Unlike past studies, gender was not found to be a factor in treatment status. However, untreated persons had higher chart-abstracted viral loads and were more likely to be ethnic minorities, have a lower level of education, greater level of depression, and greater pessimistic attitude. They were significantly more likely to have used alcohol, powder cocaine, and crack cocaine in the previous 3 months, were likely to know their own viral load and CD4 count, and held significantly more negative views of their health care and their health care providers. There were no differences between untreated and treated persons in their meeting the year 1999 antiretroviral treatment guidelines that were in effect at the time of data collection. These results suggest that persons who are not receiving antiretroviral medications may be in need of mental health and substance use interventions and may benefit from interventions designed to engage and retain them in medical treatment."
2722,0.015,3.0000,": To date, the relation between the CD8 antiviral factor (CAF) and clinical indicators of disease progression in HIV-1 infection (CD4 T-cell counts and viral load [VL]) is inconclusive. Particularly, the effect of antiretroviral therapy and immune recovery on CAF production remains unclear. Using a transient transfection assay and a reporter gene activated by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), we analyzed CAF production in CD8 T cells of HIV-1-positive individuals divided into 3 groups: patients on protease inhibitor (PI)-based therapy, patients on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapy, and patients receiving no therapy. We found that within the untreated group, CAF activity inversely correlated with VL and high CAF was associated with lower VLs over a period of 0.5 to 3 years. Furthermore, patients who were drug-naive demonstrated significantly higher CAF than untreated patients who had previously undergone antiretroviral therapy. CAF activity in treated patients was similar to CAF in drug-naive patients and higher than in off-treatment patients. There seemed to be a trend toward higher CAF in patients on NNRTI-based therapy compared with those on PI-based therapy. These results suggest that immune recovery after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) contributes to the normalization of CAF levels in HIV-1-positive individuals. Furthermore, we have distinguished between CD8 T-cell-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication and gene transcription."
6590,0.015,3.0000,"The introduction of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in resource-poor settings is effective in suppressing HIV-1 replication and prolonging life of infected individuals. This has led to a demand for affordable HIV-1 drug resistance assays, since treatment failure due to development of drug resistance is common. This study developed and evaluated an affordable ""in-house"" genotyping assay to monitor HIV-1 drug resistance in Africa, particularly South Africa. An ""in-house"" assay using automated RNA extraction, and subtype C specific PCR and sequencing primers was developed and successfully evaluated 396 patient samples (viral load ranges 1000-1.6 million RNA copies/ml). The ""in-house"" assay was validated by comparing sequence data and drug resistance profiles from 90 patient and 10 external quality control samples to data from the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping kit. The ""in-house"" assay was more efficient, amplifying all 100 samples, compared to 91 samples using Viroseq. The ""in house"" sequences were 99.2% homologous to the ViroSeq sequences, and identical drug resistance mutation profiles were observed in 96 samples. Furthermore, the ""in-house"" assay genotyped 260 of 295 samples from seven African sites, where 47% were non-subtype C. Overall, the newly validated ""in-house"" drug resistance assay is suited for use in Africa as it overcomes the obstacle of subtype diversity."
2968,0.015,3.0000,"Clinical observations suggest that chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in the Canadian Inuit are less often associated with serious adverse outcomes than has been described in other HBV-infected patient populations. The aim of this study was to document the clinical and biochemical features, liver-related morbidity and all-cause mortality in Canadian Inuit with chronic HBV infections. Administrative databases were reviewed for individuals identified as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive during a 1983-85 seroepidemiological survey of viral hepatitis in Baffin Island, Canada. An equal number of age- and gender-matched HBsAg-negative individuals from the same communities served as controls. Baseline HBV viral loads, genotypes and specific mutations were compared in HBsAg-positive survivors and nonsurvivors. A subset of surviving HBsAg-positive carriers were reassessed 25-30 years following their initial diagnosis for evidence of advanced liver disease and changes to their serological/virological findings. One hundred and forty four HBsAg-positive individuals were identified. All were Canadian Inuit. The mean age at diagnosis was 38 ¬± 17 years and 69 (61%) were male. Median follow-up was 23 years (range: 2-28 years). Viral quantitation from stored sera could be performed in 70 infected individuals. The median viral load was 4.3 log 10 IU/ml (range: 2.3-8.8 log 10 IU/ml), and all were genotype B, subgenotype B6. Liver biochemistry, morbidity and all-cause mortality rates were similar in HBsAg-positive carriers and controls. Following multivariate analyses, only age at diagnosis predicted mortality in HBsAg carriers. In a subset of 30 HBsAg-positive survivors who underwent follow-up assessments, clinical, biochemical and radiological examinations of the liver were essentially normal. 23/30 (77%) remained HBsAg positive and 17/19 (90%) HBV-DNA positive. The genotype and prevalence of genomic mutations in this cohort remained largely unchanged, but quantifiable viral loads were significantly lower (P < 0.003). The results of this study suggest that chronic HBV infections in the Canadian Inuit are infrequently associated with serious adverse outcomes. Whether this finding reflects unique features of the host, presence or absence of external factors that influence the course of HBV and/or intrinsic properties of the HBV B6 subgenotype remains to be determined."
9724,0.015,3.0000,"There is limited knowledge about how to treat and interpret results from genotypic resistance assays in HIV-2 infection. Here, genetic variation in HIV-2 pol gene was studied in 20 of 23 known HIV-2 cases in Sweden. Five patients with signs of virological treatment failure were longitudinally studied. Clinical, virological and immunological data were collected and the protease (PR) and first half of the reverse transcriptase (RT) was amplified and directly sequenced from plasma samples. Moderate to extensive genetic evolution was observed in four of the five patients who failed treatment. Some mutations occurred at positions known to confer resistance in HIV-1, but many occurred at other positions in PR and RT. All patients had been treated with zidovudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, but none displayed a mutation at position 215, which is the primary zidovudine resistance site in HIV-1. Instead, a E219D mutation evolved in virus from two patients and a Q151M mutation evolved in two other patients. A M184V mutation indicative of lamivudine resistance was detected in three patients. The virus of one patient who had been treated with ritonavir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir successively acquired nine unusual mutations in the protease gene, most of which are not considered primary or secondary resistance mutations in HIV-1. Our data indicate that the evolutionary pathways that lead to antiretroviral resistance in HIV-2 and HIV-1 exhibit both similarities and differences. Genotypic HIV-2 resistance assays cannot be interpreted using algorithms developed for HIV-1, instead new algorithms specific for HIV-2 have to be developed."
7203,0.015,3.0000,"Injecting drug users (IDUs) are at high risk for infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne pathogens. In the United States, IDUs account for nearly one-third of the cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), either directly or indirectly (heterosexual and perinatal cases of AIDS where the source of infection was an IDU). IDU also account for a substantial proportion of cases of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus infections. The primary mode of transmission of HIV among IDUs is parenteral, through direct needle sharing or multiperson use of syringes. Despite high levels of knowledge about risk, multiperson use of needles and syringes is due primarily to fear of arrest and incarceration for violation of drug paraphernalia laws and ordinances that prohibit manufacture, sale, distribution, or possession of equipment and materials intended to be used with narcotics. It is estimated that in 1997 there were approximately 110 needle exchange programs (NEPs) in North America. In part, because of the ban on the use of Federal funds for the operation of needle exchange, it has been difficult to evaluate the efficacy of these programs. This chapter presents data from the studies that have evaluated the role of NEPs in HIV prevention. Evidence for the efficacy of NEPs comes from three source: (1) studies originally focused on the effectiveness of NEPs in non-HIV blood-borne infections, (2) mathematical modeling of data on needle exchange on HIV seroincidence, and (3) studies that examine the positive and negative impact of NEPs on HIV and AIDS. Case-control studies have provided powerful data on the positive effect of NEPs on reduction of two blood-borne viral infections (HBV and HCV) For example, a case-control study in Tacoma, Washington, showed that a six-fold increase in HBV and a seven-fold increase in HCV infections in IDUs were associated with nonuse of the NEP. The first federally funded study of needle exchange was an evaluation of the New Haven NEP, which is legally operated by the New Haven Health Department. Rather than relying on self-report of reduced risky injection drug use, this study utilized mathematical and statistical modeling, using data from a syringe tracking and testing system. Incidence of HIV infection among needle exchange participants was estimated to have decreased by 33% as a result of the NEP. A series of Government-commissioned reports have reviewed the data on positive and negative outcomes of NEPs. The major reports are from the National Commission on AIDS; the U.S. General Accounting Office; the Centers for Disease Control/University of California; and the National Academy of Sciences. The latter two reports are used in this chapter. The aggregated results support the positive benefit of NEPs and do not support negative outcomes from NEPs. When legal restrictions on both purchase and possession of syringes are removed, IDUs will change their syringe-sharing behaviors in ways that can reduce HIV transmission. NEPs do not result in increased drug use among participants or the recruitment of first-time drug users."
8785,0.015,3.0000,"The emergence of human immunodeficiency virus resistant to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT) in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex has been documented. Isolates from non-AZT-treated persons or those who had received AZT for less than six months showed a narrow range of susceptibility to the drug; on the other hand, isolates from those who had received AZT for six months or more consistently showed reduced susceptibility. Five highly AZT-resistant isolates were also insensitive to other compounds containing a 3'-azido group. No cross-resistance was found to other nucleoside analogues, including 2',3'-dideoxycytidine and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine. That cross-resistance occurred only in compounds containing a 3'-azido group suggests that mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene prohibit the enzyme from using nucleoside triphosphate containing a 3'-azido group. Progressive, stepwise increases in resistance have been associated with the sequential accumulation of specific amino acid changes in the reverse transcriptase gene. It is not yet known whether the resistant phenotype as determined in vitro results in clinical resistance to AZT. The gradual appearance of resistant isolates, the variable course of human immunodeficiency virus infections, and the absence of a consistent pattern of resurgent p24 antigen will make the emergence of AZT resistance difficult to correlate with clinical status or other markers. The combination of AZT with other drugs that do not share cross-resistance is a promising area for investigation to identify regimens that are more active and less likely to induce resistance."
9292,0.015,3.0000,"To investigate the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) among individuals with recent HIV-1 infection between February 2004 and January 2010 in a rural clinical cohort, samples from 72 participants were analyzed. Results from the 72 participants showed no protease inhibitor and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated mutations. One participant (1.4%, 95% CI: 0.04-7.5%) had two nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations (G190E and P225H). HIV-1 subtype frequencies were A 22 (30.6%), D 38 (52.8%), and C 1 (1.4%); 11 (15.3%) were A/D unique recombinant forms. Seven years after the scale up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a rural clinical cohort in Uganda, the prevalence of TDR among recently HIV-1-infected individuals was low at 1.4%. Since our findings from an HIV study cohort may not be generalizable to the general population, routine TDR surveys in specific populations may be necessary to inform policy on the magnitude and prevention strategies of TDR."
6919,0.015,3.0000,"This consensus document has been prepared by a panel consisting of members of the AIDS Study Group (Gesida) and the Spanish Secretariat for the National Plan on AIDS (SPNS) after reviewing the efficacy and safety results of clinical trials, cohort and pharmacokinetic studies published in medical journals, or presented in medical scientific meetings. Gesida has prepared an objective and structured method to prioritise combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) in na√Øve patients. Recommendations strength (A, B, C) and the evidence which supports them (I, II, III) are based on a modification of the Infectious Diseases Society of America criteria. The current antiretroviral treatment (ART) of choice for chronic HIV infection is the combination of three drugs. ART is recommended in patients with symptomatic HIV infection, in pregnancy, in serodiscordant couples with high transmission risk, hepatitis B fulfilling treatment criteria, and HIV nephropathy. Guidelines on ART treatment in patients with concurrent diagnosis of HIV infection and an opportunistic type C infection are included. In asymptomatic patients ART is recommended on the basis of CD4 lymphocyte counts, plasma viral load and patient co-morbidities, as follows: 1) therapy should be started in patients with CD4 counts <350 cells/ŒºL; 2) when CD4 counts are between 350 and 500 cells/ŒºL, therapy will be recommended and only delayed if patient is reluctant to take it, the CD4 are stabilised, and the plasma viral load is low; 3) therapy could be deferred when CD4 counts are above 500 cells/ŒºL, but should be considered in cases of cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C, high cardiovascular risk, plasma viral load >10(5) copies/mL, proportion of CD4 cells <14%, and in people aged >55 years. ART should include 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors nucleoside analogues and a third drug (non-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor or integrase inhibitor). The panel has consensually selected and given priority to using the Gesida score for some drug combinations, some of them co-formulated. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable viral load. Adherence to therapy plays an essential role in maintaining antiviral response. Therapeutic options are limited after ART failures, but an undetectable viral load may be possible nowadays. Adverse events are a fading problem of ART. Guidelines in acute HIV infection, in women, in pregnancy, and to prevent mother-to-child transmission and pre- and post-exposition prophylaxis are commented upon. Management of hepatitis B or C co-infection, other co-morbidities, and the characteristics of ART in HIV-2 infection are included."
4644,0.015,3.0000,"Korea is a low prevalence country for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and has an intermediate tuberculosis (TB) burden. We previously reported that the incidence of TB in HIV-infected patients was 9.6 cases per 100 person-years (P-Y) between 1988 and 1997. The aims of the present study were to measure any change in incidence from the previous study, and to identify risk factors for TB in HIV-infected patients. We reviewed all medical records of HIV-infected patients who were followed-up in one tertiary hospital between 1998 and 2010. Over the total observation period of 5858.33 P-Y, TB developed in 70 patients (1.19 cases per 100 P-Y; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-1.47 cases per 100 P-Y). Based on Poisson regression, one risk factor associated with TB was an initial CD4+ cell count below 200 cells/¬µL (relative risk, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.47-3.73). Mean CD4+ cell counts of pulmonary, extrapulmonary, and both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB were 179.8 cells/¬µL, 138.3 cells/¬µL, and 114.2 cells/¬µL, respectively (P = 0.55). In conclusion, the incidence of TB in HIV-infected patients has decreased since the previous study. An initial CD4+ cell count below 200 cells/¬µL is an independent risk factor for development of TB in HIV-infected patients."
5656,0.015,3.0000,"HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is of increasing public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa with the rollout of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Such data are, however, limited in Kenya, where HIV-1 drug resistance testing is not routinely performed. From a population-based household survey conducted between September and November 2012 in rural western Kenya, we retrospectively assessed HIV-1 TDR baseline rates, its determinants, and genetic diversity among drug-na√Øve persons aged 15-59 years with acute HIV-1 infections (AHI) and recent HIV-1 infections (RHI) as determined by nucleic acid amplification test and both Limiting Antigen and BioRad avidity immunoassays, respectively. HIV-1 pol sequences were scored for drug resistance mutations using Stanford HIVdb and WHO 2009 mutation guidelines. HIV-1 subtyping was computed in MEGA6. Eighty seven (93.5%) of the eligible samples were successfully sequenced. Of these, 8 had at least one TDR mutation, resulting in a TDR prevalence of 9.2% (95% CI 4.7-17.1). No TDR was observed among persons with AHI (n = 7). TDR prevalence was 4.6% (95% CI 1.8-11.2) for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 6.9% (95% CI 3.2-14.2) for non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and 1.2% (95% CI 0.2-6.2) for protease inhibitors. Three (3.4% 95% CI 0.8-10.1) persons had dual-class NRTI/NNRTI resistance. Predominant TDR mutations in the reverse transcriptase included K103N/S (4.6%) and M184V (2.3%); only M46I/L (1.1%) occurred in the protease. All the eight persons were predicted to have different grades of resistance to the ARV regimens, ranging from potential low-level to high-level resistance. HIV-1 subtype distribution was heterogeneous: A (57.5%), C (6.9%), D (21.8%), G (2.3%), and circulating recombinant forms (11.5%). Only low CD4 count was associated with TDR (p = 0.0145). Our findings warrant the need for enhanced HIV-1 TDR monitoring in order to inform on population-based therapeutic guidelines and public health interventions."
5665,0.015,3.0000,"Since the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), solid organ transplantation (SOT) has become a therapeutic option for the HIV-positive population. In contrast with liver and kidney transplantation, only three simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplants (SPKT) have been reported among HIV-infected patients. Herein we have reported the first SPKT in an HIV-infected patient in Spain. The pancreas graft failed at 2 weeks and the patient died at 9 months because of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. The three recipients reported in the literature lived, despite the failure of both the pancreas and kidney grafts in one subject. Despite the poor outcome of our case, HIV-1 infection was controlled after transplantation (stable CD4(+) cells and no AIDS-related events), and the kidney graft functioned with no episodes of rejection. The cART regimen used in the pretransplant period was switched at the time of transplantation to raltegravir and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Raltegravir has no interactions with immunosuppressive drugs. Target plasma levels of tacrolimus were achieved at a dose similar to that used in HIV-negative transplant recipients. The most adequate antiretroviral regimen for HIV-infected SOT recipients has not yet been established; however, one may consider switching protease inhibitors or non-NRTI-based regimens for a raltegravir-based regimen at the time of transplantation."
9923,0.015,3.0000,"The recent expansion of antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage in middle/low-income countries has been associated with increasing prevalence of HIV pre-ART drug resistance (PDR). We assessed PDR prevalence, patterns, and trends in Guatemala. Blood samples from 1,084 ART-naive individuals, enrolled from October 2010 to December 2013 at the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala City, were obtained. PDR was evaluated using the WHO mutation list for transmitted drug resistance (TDR) surveillance. An overall PDR prevalence of 7.3% (95% CI 5.8-9.0%) was observed for the whole study period. TDR to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) was the highest (4.9%, p<0.001), followed by nucleoside RT inhibitors (1.8%) and protease inhibitors (1.0%). No significant trends in PDR prevalence were observed during the study period. However, higher NNRTI PDR levels were found in individuals with >500 and 350-500 CD4(+) T cells/Œºl (7.4% and 8.7%, respectively) compared to individuals with <350 CD4(+) T cells/Œºl (3.7%; p=0.039 and p=0.007, respectively), as well as a tendency of higher levels of NNRTI transmitted drug resistance (DR) in individuals with recent infection determined by HIV incidence tests (9.7%), suggesting increasing trends in time. Clusters of viruses with NNRTI PDR suggesting complex transmission networks were observed. No associations between PDR and demographic variables were found. PDR in Guatemala remains at an intermediate level. Nevertheless, we have shown evidence suggesting increasing trends in NNRTI PDR, which need to be taken into account in national HIV management policies."
4476,0.015,3.0000,"Retroviral genomes with a high frequency of G-->A mutations are thought to originate during reverse transcription (RT). Here we present a case report of an AIDS patient infected with a subtype F variant where extensive G-->A hypermutation (G-->A Hypm) sequences were found in the protease gene. This patient was failing HAART at the time the hypermutation was found. These sequences were basically encountered in the proviral compartment on two occasions and were persistently absent in the plasma viral population. The patient's viral genotype showed several mutations related to antiretroviral drug resistance in RT (T69N, M184V, T215F, K219Q) and protease (M36I, G48V, I54V, T63L, V82A) genes. The drug regimen was changed and the viral load dropped 0.9 Logs and CD4 count increased by 200 cells/ml. The hypermutation was not found any more in a 1-year follow up. The patient's wife was infected with a similar virus strain and G-->A Hypm sequences were also detected in the RT gene. This is the first report of sexual transmitted G-->A Hypermutation in HIV-1 and suggest that this phenomenon can be genetically coded by the viral RT molecule."
9472,0.015,3.0000,"Mycobacterial infection remains as a frequent complication associated to HIV infection. Although the widespread use of HAART has intensely decreased incidence of disseminated Mycobacterium avium (MAC) infection, it does not seem that it has affected tuberculosis occurrence so intensely. In spite of the intense search of new methods of rapid diagnosis, in the clinical practice the diagnosis of the mycobacterial illnesses continues based on culture, although the appearance of new media has allowed to shorten the time of growth. The combination of isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF) and pirazinamide (PZ) (with ethambutol [ETB] when primary resistance to INH is higher than 4%), remains as the elective treatment for tuberculosis in HIV infected patients. Due to the interaction between RIF and some antiretovirals drugs, such as proteasa inhibitors, a change in the usual regimens could be necessary. Combinations without RIF or antiretroviral therapy with drugs not interacting with RIF (nucleosides, ritonavir or nevirapin) have been suggested. The emergence of strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to the antituberculosis drugs, the lack of adherence to treatment, and the frequency of adverse events hinders even more the control of the tuberculosis and they demand a narrow follow up of these patients. The treatment of the disseminated infection by MAC has improved in the last years with the generalization of the combinations including macrolides as claritromicin or azitromicin with ETB. The doubt persists about what combination is more effective, although like in other opportunists infections associated with a severe immunodeficiency, using antiretrovirals combinations that enhance the immune system could be a fundamental therapeutic approach."
9070,0.015,3.0000,"The persistence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is maintained by the nuclear viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which serves as transcription template for viral mRNAs. Previous studies suggested that cccDNA contains methylation-prone CpG islands, and that the minichromosome structure of cccDNA is epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation. However, the regulatory effect of each CpG island methylation on cccDNA activity remains elusive. In the present study, we analyzed the distribution of CpG methylation within cccDNA in patient samples and investigated the impact of CpG island methylation on cccDNA-driven virus replication. Our study revealed the following observations: 1) Bisulfite sequencing of cccDNA from chronic hepatitis B patients indicated that CpG island I was seldom methylated, 2) CpG island II methylation was correlated to the low level of serum HBV DNA in patients, and in vitro methylation studies confirmed that CpG island II methylation markedly reduced cccDNA transcription and subsequent viral core DNA replication, 3) CpG island III methylation was associated with low serum HBsAg titers, and 4) Furthermore, we found that HBV genotype, HBeAg positivity, and patient age and liver fibrosis stage were also relevant to cccDNA CpG methylation status. Therefore, we clearly demonstrated that the status of cccDNA methylation is connected to the biological behavior of HBV. Taken together, our study provides a complete profile of CpG island methylation within HBV cccDNA and new insights for the function of CpG methylation in regulating HBV cccDNA transcription. "
3384,0.015,3.0000,"An unusual hepatitis B virus (HBV) variant, assigned provisionally to genotype I, was recently reported, characterized by an anomalous genotyping pattern and putative recombination; however, the natural history of this unusual strain is unknown. This study analyzed longitudinal sera collected over a 9-year period from a patient infected with this variant to investigate the clinical profile and intrahost viral evolution over time. The patient, who had immigrated to Canada in 1998 from Vietnam, was treated with lamivudine in 2000. Approximately 4-5 years following the withdrawal of lamivudine therapy, a genomic ""shift"" occurred coincident with ALT flares and increasing HBV viral load, resulting in numerous stable nucleotide substitutions within the core coding region, suggesting altered immune control that may provide a selective advantage to the virus. Analysis of quasispecies diversity over time demonstrated further this shift, with two sequence clusters associated with time points either prior to or following relapse observed, including increased diversity among quasispecies prior to relapse. In keeping with the complex nature of genotype I strains, majority population genomes had a mean genetic distance from genotype C of 7.6 +/- 0.1%, although large genomic segments lacked significant homology with any HBV genotype. Further study is needed to understand the evolutionary origin and natural history of infection with this unique HBV variant."
5222,0.015,3.0000,"There are limited data on the efficacy of T cell-based assays to detect tuberculosis (TB) antigen-specific responses in immune-deficient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in patients with HIV-1 infection, especially in those with advanced disease (CD4 T cell count < 300 cells/microl). An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, which detects interferon (IFN)-gamma secreted by T cells exposed to TB antigens, was used to assess specific immune responses in a prospective study of 201 HIV-1-infected patients with risk factors for TB infection, attending a single HIV unit. The performance of the ELISPOT assay to detect TB antigen-specific immune responses is independent of CD4 T cell counts in HIV-1 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis does not differ significantly from values obtained in immunocompetent subjects. The negative predictive value of the TB ELISPOT test is 98.2%. A positive predictive value of 86% for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis was found when the combined number of early secretory antigen target-6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein-10 (CFP-10) IFN-gamma spots to CD4 T cell count ratio was > 1.5. TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in HIV patients with low CD4 T cell counts using ELISPOT technology in a routine diagnostic laboratory and is a useful test to exclude TB infection in immune-deficient HIV-1 patients. A combination of TB antigen-specific IFN-gamma responses and CD4 T cell counts has the potential to distinguish active tuberculosis from latent infection."
9188,0.015,3.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates from Iranian patients around the country were characterized. Eighty-one complete genomes from HBV isolates were sequenced and analyzed. The studied population was grouped into three categories including inactive carriers, patients with chronic hepatitis, and patients with liver cirrhosis. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses revealed that Iranian patients were infected with HBV genotype D and subgenotype D1. The most common subtype was ayw2, followed by ayw3 and ayw4. Several deletions and insertions that had no correlation with disease outcome were observed in the HBV genomes. The most frequent mutation in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was sP120S. Almost half of the patients studied carried precore (PC) mutant variants and one-third of the studied population was infected with variants carrying basal core promoter (BCP) mutations. PC and BCP mutations were observed in older patients, especially in those with chronic liver disease. Sixty-seven patients (82.7%) were HBeAg negative, and the prevalence of precore mutant isolates (G1896A) was higher in this group than in HBeAg-positive patients. Lamivudine drug resistance mutations were detected after 1 year of treatment in about 30% of lamivudine-treated patients. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that HBV subgenotype D1 is the only subgenotype circulating in Iran, and there is no evidence of any exotic genotype in the region. The HBV PC (G1896A) mutation may play an important role in the clinical outcome of the disease by increasing the risk of progressive liver disease among Iranian patients infected with HBV."
3766,0.015,3.0000,"Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) after cytotoxic chemotherapy is a serious problem, and it occurred to 41% of breast cancer patients carrying HBV. Previous studies have demonstrated that lamivudine was effective for HBV flare-up during cytotoxic chemotherapy. We aimed to monitor the HBV status of breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy with preemptive lamivudine over time. Six breast cancer patients carrying hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were monitored during chemotherapy, five in the adjuvant setting and one with metastatic disease. Preemptive lamivudine was given throughout the chemotherapy course. HBsAg, HBV envelope antigen (HBeAg), anti-HBV envelope antibody (HBe Ab), serial serum alanine transaminase (ALT), quantitative HBV viral DNA analysis, and HBV DNA precore promoter and precore sequence were monitored. One patient carried wild type and the other five precore mutant strain of HBV by examination of HBV sequence in precore promoter and precore region. No evident HBV reactivation developed, and all patients tolerated lamivudine well. During the 6-to-8-month follow-up after cessation of cytotoxic therapy and withdrawal of lamivudine, serum ALT remained unchanged, although an increase of HBV DNA levels in four patients was found. No emergence of the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) lamivudine-selective resistant strain was observed in the six patients. Preemptive use of lamivudine can effectively prevent reactivation of HBV in breast cancer patients receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Lamivudine can be discontinued safely without emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV strain or rebound HBV flare-up. The candidate for the use of preemptive lamivudine in HBV carriers who need short-term chemotherapy remained to be investigated"
2117,0.015,3.0000,"We investigated the influence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes on the clinical course of HCV infection in a haemodialysis population. In June 1991, a 4 year prospective follow-up programme was implemented in 184 consecutive haemodialysis patients. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma glutamine transferase (GGT) were performed every 2 months. When HCV antibody (Ab) (by second-generation ELISA) was positive, it was confirmed by RIBA 2 and HCV RNA amplification by PCR. The pattern of nucleotide sequence variability in the 5' non-coding region was categorized according to Simmonds' genotype classification. Risk factors including blood transfusions were evaluated. The levels of hepatic enzymes in HCV Ab-positive patients were retrospectively studied over a mean period of 11.8 years. ALT and GGT levels were assigned a score for every year of infection (0 = normal, 1 = fluctuating 2 = high levels). Fifty-two patients were HCV Ab reactive (30.4%), eight were RIBA undetermined and 44 were RIBA positive; 40 of these were HCV RNA positive (91%). Twelve patients were HCV RNA negative, suggesting that they had recovered from the infection. Four genotypes were identified: 1b [26 patients (65%)], 1a (one patient), 2 [12 patients (30%)] and 3 (one patient). The genotype distribution was not different from that found in patients with chronic hepatitis C and normal renal function of the same geographical area. Genotype 1b accounted for 75% of the cases before 1985 and an equal prevalence of the two major genotypes was observed after 1985. Patients infected with HCV subtype 1 had normal mean ALT levels, but higher levels in the follow-up period (28 +/- 15.6 IU/l) and higher ALT and GGT personal scores in the retrospective study. Genotype 1 patients had higher mean ALT levels after 6 months. HCV RNA-negative patients had lower ALT levels after 24 months. RIBA pattern could differentiate the patients. Patients with genotype 1 received a higher number of transfusions, while only 50% of HCV RNA-negative patients had been transfused. Our data suggest a worse course of HCV infection in haemodialysis patients infected with HCV subtype 1, but the severity of HCV infection can only be assessed by histology. Transaminases are only loosely correlated with severity."
2709,0.015,3.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B affects nearly 10% of HIV-infected patients. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a dynamic disease and coinfection with HIV impacts directly on the outcome of HBV infection, considerably complicating its natural history, diagnosis, and management. The aim of this study was to compare two cohorts of HBV monoinfected and HBV/HIV coinfected Iranian patients undergoing long-term lamivudine therapy from the clinical and virological aspects, as well as the frequency of detected mutations in HBV genome. To this end, HBV Pol/S regions from 72 patients were PCR-amplified and directly sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a 40-times higher risk of coinfection with ayw3 subtype of HBV genotype D rather than ayw2 subtype [P<0.001, odd: 40.66, CI: 95 % (4.69-352.23)]. While no resistance mutation was detected in HBV/HIV coinfected cohort, LAM-resistance mutations (rtM204I/V in YMDD and rtL180M in FLLA polymerase motifs) were identified in 30% (9 out of 30) and 16.66% (5 out of 30) of HBV monoinfected patients (P<0.05). Moreover, several mutations (sP105A, sI110S/L, sS136Y and sP127T/L) with significant differences in the frequency were identified in the S region of both cohorts. Finally, this study found strong correlation between the type of infection (mono or coinfection) and characteristics like patient gender, ALT levels, HBV-DNA levels and HBV subtypes. These results pointed to the importance of determination of HBV variants in the management of patients and suggested that in contrary to HBV monoinfections, LAM may be still an appropriate drug for the treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV coinfected patients; however, further studies to clarify the role of HIV in HBV LAM-resistance mutations are required."
5531,0.015,3.0000,"Effective antiretroviral therapy initially resulted in large decreases in hospitalization rates of HIV-infected patients. The goal of this study was to determine whether these gains were being maintained in 2001. A cross-sectional study of hospital admission characteristics during four time periods was performed. All patients receiving care at the HIV clinics of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (NYPH) in New York City were included. In 1995, 883 outpatients were receiving care for HIV infection at NYPH; this increased to 1990 outpatients by 2001. Demographic and laboratory information was obtained for these outpatients, and diagnoses were recorded for all patients requiring hospitalization on at NYPH during the time periods January 1 through June 30, in 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001. The incidence of hospital admission declined in all four time periods: 1995 (95 per 100 patient-years [pt-yr]), 1997 (48 per 100 pt-yr), 1999 (38 per 100 pt-yr, p < 0.05), and 2001 (25 per 100 pt-yr). The incidence of bacterial pneumonia and opportunistic infections (OIs) decreased in all four time periods. The median hospitalization were CD4(+) cell count for outpatients increased from 231 (1995) to 364 (2001). Important predictors of hospitalization were CD4(+) < 200, and IVDU as an HIV risk factor. Since 1995 and the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, continuing increases in CD4(+) cell counts of outpatients has been reflected in persistent declines in hospitalization rates. Large decreases in OIs and pneumonia have been minimally offset by stable rates of hospital admissions for diagnoses such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and cellulitis."
1917,0.015,3.0000,"HIV-seropositive, active injection-drug users (IDUs), compared with other HIV populations, continue to have low rates of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use, contributing to disparities in their HIV health outcomes. We sought to identify individual-level, interpersonal, and structural factors associated with HAART use among active IDUs to inform comprehensive, contextually tailored intervention to improve the HAART use of IDUs. Prospective data from three semiannual assessments were combined, and logistic general estimating equations were used to identify variables associated with taking HAART 6 months later. Participants were a community sample of HIV-seropositive, active IDUs enrolled in the INSPIRE study, a U.S. multisite (Baltimore, Miami, New York, San Francisco) prevention intervention. The analytic sample included 1,225 observations, and comprised 62% males, 75% active drug users, 75% non-Hispanic blacks, and 55% with a CD4 count <350; 48% reported HAART use. Adjusted analyses indicated that the later HAART use of IDUs was independently predicted by patient-provider engagement, stable housing, medical coverage, and more HIV primary care visits. Significant individual factors included not currently using drugs and a positive attitude about HAART benefits even if using illicit drugs. Those who reported patient-centered interactions with their HIV primary care provider had a 45% greater odds of later HAART use, and those with stable housing had twofold greater odds. These findings suggest that interventions to improve the HIV treatment of IDUs and to reduce their HIV health disparities should be comprehensive, promoting better patient-provider engagement, stable housing, HAART education with regard to illicit drug use, and integration of drug-abuse treatment with HIV primary care."
5189,0.01,2.0000,"Despite the fact that the survival of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has improved worldwide because of the increasingly powerful and highly active antiretroviral therapy, opportunistic infections (OIs) of the central nervous system (CNS) remain a serious burden. HIV-1 is capable of entering the CNS through infected peripheral monocytes, but its effect on OIs of CNS remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of HIV-1 in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with CNS OIs. A total of 24 patients with CNS OIs and 16 non-CNS OIs (control) cases were selected. These AIDS patients were infected with HIV-1 by paid blood donors in China. HIV-1 loads in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were detected using RT-PCR, and the C2-V5 region of HIV-1 envelope gene was amplified from viral quasispecies isolated from CSF using nested PCR. The CSF HIV-1 load of CNS OIs was higher than that of non-CNS OIs, but plasma HIV-1 load of CNS OIs was not higher than that of non-CNS OIs. The nucleotide sequence of C2-V5 region of the HIV-1 quasispecies isolated from the CSF of CNS OIs had a high diversity, and the HIV-1 quasispecies isolated from the CSF of CNS OIs revealed R5 tropism as 11/25 charge rule. These results suggest that high levels of divergent HIV-1 quasispecies in the CNS probably contribute to opportunistic infections. "
572,0.01,2.0000,"Virus variants escaping from host immunity may be implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In this cross-sectional study, the association was evaluated of the frequency of amino acid variation within the immunogenic epitopes of surface gene with different disease stages of chronic HBV infection. The surface gene of HBV encompassing the a determinant (amino acids 124-148) and the putative HLA class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope (amino acids 28- 51) were amplified and directly sequenced in 33 asymptomatic carriers (Group I), 31 patients with chronic hepatitis (Group II), 22 with cirrhosis (Group III), and 36 with hepatocellular carcinoma (Group IV). The amino acid sequences were compared subsequently with the consensus sequences of HBV serotype adw or adr. The frequency of amino acid variation per site per sequence (FEQ) was analyzed by generalized estimating equation with Poisson model after stratification by clinical and virological features. The FEQ was 1.21% overall, and was highest in Group IV patients and in patients above 50 years of age. In contrast, nine Group IV patients aged below 50 years who were infected with serotype adw had an inversely higher FEQ than those above 50; the age effect among hepatocellular carcinoma patients was significantly different from that among non-cancerous patients (P = 0.04). Variation of amino acid clustered within a determinant and CTL epitope for serotype adw but was distributed at random for serotype adr. Mutation hotspots differed between serotypes adw and adr. The FEQ of HBV surface protein is correlated positively with advancing age and severity of liver disease, and certain variants may contribute to the persistence of HBV infection."
2019,0.01,2.0000,"The main goal of the present paper was to analyze the molecular diversity of the principal neutralizing domain (V3 loop) of the HIV 1 gp120 in samples from patients of Argentina. The study was carried out on a total of 30 HIV 1 positive blood samples, obtained during 1991-1992, belonging to 15 intravenous drug users (group A), 5 homosexual men (group B), 8 children born to HIV 1 positive mothers (group C) and 2 AIDS patients (group D). By using extracted DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and from infected cells of the viral isolates in the case of the 2 AIDS patients, the V3 loop region was amplified by means of polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequencing by Sanger methodology was then performed on DNA fragments and nucleotide sequences obtained were translated into the correspondent amino acids. Consensus sequences for each group and a general consensus sequence were established (Table 1). Its alignment with V3 loop amino acid sequences of the major HIV 1 strains isolated worldwide is showed in table 2. Homology analysis between each sequence of the study population and sequence of different HIV 1 isolates showed that most of these samples share high homology with SF2 and BH10 strains. In contrast a low homology was found with JH3 and MN isolated (table 3). The presence of highly conserved amino acid residues as substitutions and insertions was determined in the Argentinian V3 loop sequences giving them a local pattern. The present paper is of great importance for our country, considering that the V3 loop is the main neutralizing domain becoming a major target in the development of HIV 1 vaccine. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the sequencing of the principal neutralizing domain of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 in Latin America."
9849,0.01,2.0000,"The case of a young female patient with chronic active hepatitis B, vasculitic purpura, edema, and circulating immune complexes due to mixed cryoglobulinemia is described. Serum transaminases were elevated. Serological assays showed hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) antibodies but no antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) or antibody to hepatitis delta virus (anti-HDV) antibodies. Using hepatitis B virus-polymerase chain reaction (HBV-PCR) and direct sequencing a precore/core (preC/C) mutant unable to synthesize HBeAg was detected in serum. HBV antigens were demonstrated in the circulating immune complexes. Following 1 month of treatment with interferon-alpha 2b3 miu three times weekly, alanine aminotransferases returned to normal levels while cryoglobulins and immune complexes disappeared from serum. In addition, 2 months after the onset of treatment serum HBV-DNA was no longer detectable by PCR. Prior to treatment the analysis of cellular immune reactions of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a major proliferative response to HBcAg, preS1Ag and HBxAg and a minor response to HBeAg and HBsAg. One month after conclusion of treatment a decline in T-cell reactivity against all HBV antigens was observed. During clinical response to the therapy, however, a strong proliferative response of T cells to HBcAg and HBeAg was demonstrated. In conclusion, immune complex disease may complicate chronic hepatitis B in patients expressing HBe-minus HBV mutants. Treatment with interferon-alpha was found to be effective in mixed cryoglobulinemia even in the presence of HBe-minus HBV mutants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5992,0.01,2.0000,"In HIV-infected patients a low CD4:CD8 ratio can persist despite CD4 recovery with long-term antiretroviral treatment (ART). As CD4:CD8 inversion is considered a marker of immune-senescence, we aimed to assess if it was associated with the chronic inflammation state in aging patients with HIV. A total of 112 patients with a >15 year history of HIV infection and ART were included, 85 of whom were suppressed. All subjects were tested for interleukin (IL)-6, high-sensitivity (hs)-PCR, and D-dimer levels. Complete clinical, therapeutic, and hematochemical data were retrieved. Coreceptor tropism based on HIV-DNA gp120 genotyping was also available within the past 6 months. A progressive increase in the CD4:CD8 ratio over time was observed without reaching a plateau. Based on the CD4:CD8 ratio at the time of testing, patients were classified into group A (normal ratio ‚â•0.9) and group B (<0.9). A normal ratio was observed in 37% of patients. Variables associated with an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio were older age, nadir CD4, and detectable HIV viremia. No association between HIV subtype, coreceptor tropism, cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfections and CD4:CD8 ratio was observed. Group B patients showed a trend for a higher frequency of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia compared to group A patients, but they did not differ in IL-6, hs-PCR, and D-dimer levels or in frequency of severe non-AIDS-associated events. In conclusion, CD4:CD8 ratio normalization occurs rarely, even after several years of ART. Chronic inflammation in patients aging with HIV does not seem to be directly dependent on the CD4:CD8 ratio. However, the persistent immune dysregulation expressed by a CD4:CD8 inversion might be linked to a higher risk of non-AIDS events, especially metabolic disorders."
1165,0.01,2.0000,"Physical function limitations have been associated with poor health outcomes, which have a negative impact on quality of life of older individuals. This study examined the association between depression, viral load, and acculturation with physical function among Latino men living with HIV. A secondary data analysis was performed using a cross-sectional data of 146 Latino immigrant men living with HIV in New York City and Washington, DC. Physical function was measured using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Uncontrolled HIV infection and depression were associated with worse physical function, thus implying the importance of adequate health care to address these conditions. Preserving physical function should start during middle adulthood, particularly among people living with HIV because of their greater risk of developing age-related challenges such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases among others. This study informs future interventions to preserve physical function and achieve the goal of successful aging."
6921,0.01,2.0000,"Because pancreatitis has been reported frequently in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection, we sought to determine the incidence of pancreatitis in children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome by reviewing all records of children with AIDS, their serum amylase and lipase levels, and the factors associated with pancreatitis through a case-control analysis. During a 6-year period pancreatitis developed in 9 (17%) of 53 pediatric patients with AIDS. Six children had vertical transmission of infection and three patients had acquired HIV infection through contaminated blood products. Pancreatitis developed at a median age of 5.2 years (range 1.2 to 20 years). All patients had vomiting and abdominal pain. When the patients were first seen, lipase values were elevated more than amylase values (p = 0.028). Amylase and lipase levels declined at comparable rates. In the case-control analysis, pentamidine isethionate was significantly associated with pancreatitis (p = 0.02); the risk was greater in patients who received pentamidine isethionate and had absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/mm3 (p = 0.001). Infections associated with the onset of pancreatitis included cytomegalovirus (4), Cryptosporidium (1), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (3), and Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (1). Coinfection with cytomegalovirus was associated with a protracted course in four children. Ultrasonographic examination demonstrated biliary ductal dilatation 6 months after the onset of pancreatitis in one child. Seven children have died at a mean of 8 months after the initial onset of pancreatitis; the one living child has survived 5 months from the onset of pancreatitis. We conclude that pancreatitis is common in pediatric patients with AIDS and may be related to pentamidine isethionate exposure, especially when absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts are less than 100 cells/mm3. Serum amylase levels do not always accurately predict the onset of pancreatitis; serum lipase levels should be measured in children with symptoms. The onset of pancreatitis in an HIV-infected child is a poor prognostic indicator."

However, the mortality due to hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease has not been reduced in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, and HCV has recently become the most significant cause of death in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Liver transplantation might be one of the treatments of choice in such cases, but it is very difficult to evaluate the immune status of these patients due to ART, anti-HCV treatment, and HIV-related immunocompromised state."
3793,0.01,2.0000,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are among the major public health challenges in Cameroon. This paper determined the effect of men's sex-related behaviors and HIV knowledge on reported STIs. The data came from the 2012 Cameroon's Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) that were collected from 7191 respondents in 2012. Descriptive and logistic regression methods were used for data analysis. Results showed that majority of the respondents were aware of STIs and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), while 3.96% reported STIs. Also, 49.45% of the men had no wife, while 75.58% and 84.58% noted that condoms and keeping of one partner could be used to prevent HIV transmission, respectively. Wrong impressions that mosquito bites and sharing of food could lead to HIV infection were held by 31.94% and 12.44% of the men, respectively. Among those that reported STIs, 33.33%, 30.18% and 13.33% respectively used condom during sex with most recent partner, second to most recent partner and third to most recent partner, compared to 24.69%, 15.04% and 4.17% among those that did not report STIs. Logistic regression results showed that probability of STI increased significantly (p < 0.05) with condom use with third most recent partners, being married, wrong knowledge that mosquito bites cause HIV and being away for more than one month, while it significantly reduced (p < 0.05) with number of children, knowledge that having one partner prevents STIs. It was concluded that policy initiatives and programmes to enhance right sexual knowledge and behavior among men would go a long way in reducing STI incidence in Cameroon."
6657,0.01,2.0000,"Sub-Saharan Africa is disproportionately burdened by intestinal helminth and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. Recent evidence suggests detrimental immunologic effects from concomitant infection with the two pathogens. Few studies, however, have assessed the prevalence of and predictors for intestinal helminth infection among HIV-1-infected adults in urban African settings where HIV infection rates are highest. We collected and analyzed sociodemographic and parasitologic data from 297 HIV-1-infected adults (mean age = 31.1 years, 69% female) living in Lusaka, Zambia to assess the prevalence and associated predictors of helminth infection. We found at least one type of intestinal helminth in 24.9% of HIV-infected adults. Thirty-nine (52.7%) were infected with Ascaris lumbricoides, and 29 (39.2%) were infected with hookworm. More than 80% were light-intensity infections. A recent visit to a rural area, food shortage, and prior history of helminth infection were significant predictors of current helminth status. The high helminth prevalence and potential for adverse interactions between helminths and HIV suggests that helminth diagnosis and treatment should be part of routine HIV care."
4837,0.01,2.0000,"In the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era, renal dysfunction remains common. The Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV/AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN) (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00146419) is a prospective observational cohort study of HIV-infected adults. At baseline, comprehensive data were collected, including cystatin C and measures of renal function. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with baseline renal dysfunction [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) calculated using the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation] and elevated cystatin C (>1.0 mg/liter) in a cross-sectional analysis. Among 670 subjects with complete data (mean age 41 years, mean CD4 cell count 530 cells/mm(3), 79% prescribed cART), the mean eGFR was 96.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Forty percent of subjects had renal dysfunction; 3.3% had chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Elevated cystatin C was present in 18% of subjects. In multivariate analysis, renal dysfunction was associated with older age, non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, higher body mass index (BMI), hypertension, higher cystatin C levels, and current prescription of ritonavir. Factors associated with elevated cystatin C included hepatitis C coinfection, hypertension, current smoking, older age, current tenofovir use, detectable plasma HIV RNA, and elevated microalbuminuria. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was low in this contemporary HIV cohort. However, mild to moderate renal dysfunction was common despite the widespread use of cART."
8678,0.01,2.0000,"The severe complications of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome represent the final phase of a prolonged course of immune system destruction during the infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Many of these complications can be predicted by measuring the depletion of CD4 positive lymphocytes. The CD4 positive lymphocyte counts are now widely accepted as a surrogate marker to assess the stage of disease and to determine immune response in major clinical trials. Other lymphocyte subsets are candidate surrogate markers for antiretroviral therapy. Our laboratory has utilized flow cytometry to perform lymphocyte subset testing, including CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8 ratio, and others for more than three years on persons with suspected immune deficiency. Results from our laboratory are presented to illustrate the use of these procedures in an urban, predominantly inner city population. The role of flow cytometry in monitoring patients with HIV infection is discussed."
1514,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can evolve by mutations in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) to permit its escape from neutralization by antibodies such as HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs) and from host immune responses. This study investigated the prevalence and pattern of MHR mutations in North China and the clinical correlations of these mutations. The MHRs of 161 HBsAg-positive patients were amplified using nested PCR, and directly sequenced to identify MHR mutations. It was showed that among the 161 patients infected with HBV genotype C in North China, the overall frequency of MHR mutation was 46.6%. Furthermore, MHR mutations were associated with high white blood cell counts (P = 0.025), high bilirubin levels (P = 0.048), and cirrhosis (P = 0.010). The most frequent mutations in patients with both HBsAg-positive and anti-HBs-positive were located in subregion 1 and 3 of MHR, specifically, residue Q101 (29.9%) and I126 (70.6%), which was different from the mutation pattern found in Western Europe and the United States. Taken together, these data indicated important virological and clinical aspects of HBV evolution in terms of the surface gene of genotype C, which might be important for its response to the currently available HBV vaccine."
2728,0.01,2.0000,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are part of the cellular immune response to human persistent virus infections. Measurements of the frequency and specificity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CTL and their variation with time may indicate their relative importance in modulating the progression of HIV-1 infection. We have used limiting dilution analysis (LDA) to derive quantitative estimates of the frequency of HIV-1-specific CTL precursors in a cross-sectional study of 23 patients at different clinical stages of HIV-1 infection and to compare these with the frequency of CTL precursors specific for another persistent virus (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]) in the same patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated in vitro with autologous HIV-1-infected lymphoblasts and assayed for cytotoxicity in 51Cr release assays against autologous and MHC-mismatched lymphoblastoid B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the three HIV-1 structural gene products. The frequency of MHC-restricted precursors was high in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (env-specific CTL precursors up to 73/10(6) PBMC; gag-specific CTL precursors up to 488/10(6) PBMC), although the relative frequency against the different structural gene products varied from patient to patient. The HIV-1-specific CTL precursor frequency was reduced in patients who had more severe (< 400/microliters) CD4+ lymphocyte depletion, while in the majority of such patients the frequency of CTL precursors against EBV was maintained at levels observed in healthy controls. Direct CTL activity in unstimulated PBMC was observed in three of nine patients but no correlation was found between the presence of an activated CTL response and the magnitude of the CTL response detected after stimulation in LDA. Thus, CTL precursors were detected against all three HIV-1 structural gene products in patients with CD4+ lymphocyte counts > 400/microliters, at frequencies that are high compared with those reported for other persistent viruses. A CTL response directed against multiple protein antigens of HIV-1 may protect the patient against epitope variation. The fact that the EBV-specific CTL precursor frequencies were maintained in advanced HIV-1 infection suggests that there may be selective impairment of the HIV-1-specific CTL response associated with disease progression."
8078,0.01,2.0000,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a DNA-binding transcription factor activated by multiple cytokines and interferons. High expression of STAT3 has also been implicated in cancer and lymphoma. Here, we show a case of B cell lymphoma in which a defective human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) integrated upstream of the first STAT3 coding exon. The lymphoma cells with anaplastic large cell morphology formed multiple nodular lesions in the lung of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patient with Kaposi's sarcoma. The provirus had a 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) deletion, but the 3' LTR had stronger promoter activity than the STAT3 promoter in reporter assays. Immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of STAT3 in the nuclei of lymphoma cells. Transfection of STAT3 resulted in transient cell proliferation in primary B cells in vitro. Although this is a very rare case of HIV-1-integrated lymphoma, these data suggest that up-regulation of STAT3 caused by HIV-1 integration resulted in the development of B cell lymphoma in this special case."
6090,0.01,2.0000,"Hematopoietic dysfunction with peripheral cytopenias is a common complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Symptomatic anemia is the most common cytopenia and occurs in the presence and absence of myelosuppressive drug therapy such as zidovudine. Drug-induced neutropenia and immune thrombocytopenia are also frequent and occur in up to 50% of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Attempts to reduce the impact of bone marrow failure have focused on dose reduction of zidovudine, ganciclovir, and chemotherapy, and the use of recombinant hematopoietic hormones such as erythropoietin (EPO) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Despite these maneuvers, approximately 30% of patients with AIDS receiving zidovudine will become transfusion-dependent. This has led to investigations of other cytokines that may increase blood cell formation. The recent identification of decreased number and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors in patients with HIV infection suggests that agents which have activity on progenitor cell pools may have clinical utility. We demonstrate that human stem cell factor (HuSCF) increases burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), colony-forming unit-granulocyte-monocyte (CFU-GM), and CFU-Mix formation in vitro in normal and HIV-infected individuals. HuSCF also decreases the sensitivity of BFU-E to inhibition by zidovudine without altering HIV replication in lymphocytes or monocytes, altering peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) or altering the effectiveness of zidovudine or dideoxyinosine in inhibiting HIV replication in lymphocytes or monocytes. These studies suggest that HuSCF may have clinical utility in HIV infection as an adjunctive treatment for HIV-related cytopenias."
8311,0.01,2.0000,"Since modulation of the glutathione (GSH) level has been implicated in the regulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transcription and expression, we have undertaken an analysis of the effect of sodium valproate (VPA) on HIV-1 replication. VPA, which is an anti-epileptic drug in widespread use in clinical medicine, has been shown to depress the activity of GSH reductase, an enzyme required for maintaining high cellular levels of reduced GSH. The effect of this drug on HIV-1 replication has been studied in primary infected cells, i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocyte/macrophages, in the CEM-SS cell line, and in chronically infected stimulated and non-stimulated U1 cells. We have shown that VPA markedly enhanced viral replication in all infected cells tested. Virus production was induced in U1 cells by VPA treatment and the stimulatory effects of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor were augmented. The LTR-driven gene expression in Jurkat T cells was increased. However, the elevated viral production did not correlate with the effect of VPA on the intracellular GSH level. Thus, VPA stimulated in vitro HIV-1 replication in acutely and chronically infected cells and enhanced LTR-driven gene expression. These effects were observed for concentrations that are reached in the plasma of VPA-treated patients. Therefore, although the clinical significance of these data remains to be demonstrated, these results should be considered in the choice of an anticonvulsant drug in HIV-infected individuals."
4407,0.01,2.0000,"To study the pattern of transmission of HBV in a large urban community, an in-depth prospective study was performed in Hamburg between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002. In total, 524 patients were classified as hepatitis B cases according to the case definition of the Robert Koch Institute, comprising 197 foreign-born and 327 German-born persons. The principal risk factor was parenteral drug use, with 17.7% (n=93/524) of all documented cases of hepatitis B, followed by immigration as refugees (13.9%; n=73). Of all 524 cases, 72 (13.7%) were associated with heterosexual (n=41) or homosexual (n=31) transmission. Household contacts of HBV carriers or of patients with acute infectious disease contributed to 9.0% of the cases (n=47). Medical procedures were most probably the source in 7.4% (n=39), although only 3.2% (n=17) of all patients were health-care workers. In multivariate analysis of household contacts, male-male sexual activity was found to be the greatest risk factor for acquiring an acute HBV infection, followed by asylum-seeking status and the number of contacts. The incidence was 3.5-fold higher among foreign-born persons (16.1 per 100,000) than among German-born individuals (4.5 per 100,000) suggesting that a targeted intervention in this population group is a public-health need. The current national policy of vaccination in defined age groups should be extended to the immunization of all children of foreign-born parents as well as the screening and immunisation of susceptible foreign-born adults."
5786,0.01,2.0000,"Patients with treated HIV-1-infection experience earlier occurrence of aging-associated diseases, raising speculation that HIV-1-infection, or antiretroviral treatment, may accelerate aging. We recently described an age-related co-methylation module comprised of hundreds of CpGs; however, it is unknown whether aging and HIV-1-infection exert negative health effects through similar, or disparate, mechanisms. We investigated whether HIV-1-infection would induce age-associated methylation changes. We evaluated DNA methylation levels at >450,000 CpG sites in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of young (20-35) and older (36-56) adults in two separate groups of participants. Each age group for each data set consisted of 12 HIV-1-infected and 12 age-matched HIV-1-uninfected samples for a total of 96 samples. The effects of age and HIV-1 infection on methylation at each CpG revealed a strong correlation of 0.49, p<1 x 10(-200) and 0.47, p<1 x 10(-200). Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified 17 co-methylation modules; module 3 (ME3) was significantly correlated with age (cor=0.70) and HIV-1 status (cor=0.31). Older HIV-1+ individuals had a greater number of hypermethylated CpGs across ME3 (p=0.015). In a multivariate model, ME3 was significantly associated with age and HIV status (Data set 1: Œ≤age=0.007088, p=2.08 x 10(-9); Œ≤HIV=0.099574, p=0.0011; Data set 2: Œ≤age=0.008762, p=1.27 x 10(-5); Œ≤HIV=0.128649, p=0.0001). Using this model, we estimate that HIV-1 infection accelerates age-related methylation by approximately 13.7 years in data set 1 and 14.7 years in data set 2. The genes related to CpGs in ME3 are enriched for polycomb group target genes known to be involved in cell renewal and aging. The overlap between ME3 and an aging methylation module found in solid tissues is also highly significant (Fisher-exact p=5.6 x 10(-6), odds ratio=1.91). These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection is associated with methylation patterns that are similar to age-associated patterns and suggest that general aging and HIV-1 related aging work through some common cellular and molecular mechanisms. These results are an important first step for finding potential therapeutic targets and novel clinical approaches to mitigate the detrimental effects of both HIV-1-infection and aging."

Analysis of the clinicopathological features revealed that the metastatic axillary lymph node ratio was lower in the case group than the control group, as was the proportion of patients with pathological T stage ‚â•T2. No differences in the expression levels of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, p53, or Ki67 were observed between the case and control groups. These data indicate that the rate of HBV infection is high among female breast cancer patients in China, and that HBsAg-positive breast cancer patients were generally diagnosed at an earlier stage and had fewer lymph node metastases."
8717,0.01,2.0000,"HCV exists within its host as pools of related genetic variants referred to as quasispecies. The hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of the E2 envelope gene is subjected to strong selective pressure from neutralizing antibodies. The genetic complexity of this region is defined as the total number of genetic variants within the quasispecies population. The genetic complexity of the HVR1 region was examined in patients with chronic hepatitis C and its relationship with the epidemiology of HCV infection, and its influence on liver disease and the response to interferon treatment were determined in 114 patients with chronic hepatitis C. The genetic complexity of the HVR1 major variants was measured before treatment by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique, and was compared with epidemiological, clinical, virological and histological features. The patients were treated with 3 megaunits of interferon (IFN) alfa for 3 to 6 months and the response to treatment was assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months. The HVR1 could be studied in 101 of the 114 patients (89%). Genetic complexity was significantly higher in patients infected through blood transfusion than intravenous drug use (mean complexity index: 5.7 +/- 2.3 vs. 4.7 +/- 1.5, respectively; P = 0.04). This relationship was independent of age and the estimated time since infection. No significant relationship was found with other parameters of infection or liver disease. In univariate analysis, the genetic complexity of HVR1 major variants did not affect the rates of ALT normalization at months 3 and 6 of IFN treatment. HVR1 genetic complexity was lower in patients with a sustained virological response than in non-responders (4.0 +/- 1.7 vs. 5.4 +/- 2.0, respectively; P = 0.07). In multivariate analysis of pretreatment parameters associated with a sustained virological response to treatment, three parameters appeared to be independent predictors of such a response: a low viral load (P < 0.04), a low anti-HCV core IgM titer (P = 0.03) and a low genetic complexity of HVR1 major variants (P < 0.04). In conclusion, the HVR1 of HCV has a quasispecies distribution in infected individuals. Its genetic complexity is significantly higher in transfusion recipients than in intravenous drug users, suggesting that the size of the initial inoculum affects the later emergence and development of viral quasispecies. The genetic complexity of HVR1, together with viral load and the anti-HCV IgM titer, are independent predictors of a sustained virological response to IFN alfa in patients with chronic hepatitis."
5001,0.01,2.0000,"In patients with chronic hepatitis C, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA level is an important predictor of treatment response. To explore the relationship of HCV RNA with viral and demographic factors, as well as IL28B genotype, we examined viral levels in an ethnically diverse group of injection drug users (IDUs). Between 1998 and 2000, the Urban Health Study (UHS) recruited IDUs from street settings in San Francisco Bay area neighborhoods. Participants who were positive by HCV enzyme immunoassay were tested for HCV viremia by a branched-chain DNA assay. HCV genotype was determined by sequencing the HCV nonstructural 5B protein region. For a subset of participants, IL28B rs12979860 genotype was determined by Taqman. Among 1,701 participants with HCV viremia, median age was 46 years and median duration of injection drug use was 26 years; 56.0% were African American and 34.0% were of European ancestry (non-Hispanic). Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) prevalence was 13.9%. The overall median HCV RNA level was 6.45 log(10) copies/mL. In unadjusted analyses, higher levels were found with older age, male gender, African-American ancestry, hepatitis B virus infection, HIV-1 infection, and IL28B rs12979860-CC genotype; compared to participants infected with HCV genotype 1, HCV RNA was lower in participants with genotypes 3 or 4.

Recently, it has been suggested that HBV is associated with other human cancers. However, the association between HBV and the risk of onset of hematological malignancies remains controversial. The aim of this large-scale retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the association between HBV infection and hematological malignancies. A retrospective analysis of 86,115 newly admitted patients at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital was performed. A cohort of patients previously exposed to HBV (n = 1,874) and a cohort of individuals without a positive test for anti-hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc; n = 45,118) were compared to assess the risk of hematological malignancies. Anti-HBc was positive in 61.2% cases and 54.3% controls (p = 0.0001). The risk of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and multiple myeloma was higher in the HBV-infected cohort than in the non-HBV-infected cohort. In conclusion, patients infected with HBV have a substantially increased risk of hematological malignancies."
990,0.01,2.0000,"Background/Aims HIV continues to be a major public health threat in the United States, and mathematical modeling has demonstrated that the universal effective use of antiretroviral therapy among all HIV-positive individuals (i.e. the ""test and treat"" approach) has the potential to control HIV. However, to accomplish this, all the steps that define the HIV care continuum must be achieved at high levels, including HIV testing and diagnosis, linkage to and retention in clinical care, antiretroviral medication initiation, and adherence to achieve and maintain viral suppression. The HPTN 065 (Test, Link-to-Care Plus Treat [TLC-Plus]) study was designed to determine the feasibility of the ""test and treat"" approach in the United States. Methods HPTN 065 was conducted in two intervention communities, Bronx, NY, and Washington, DC, along with four non-intervention communities, Chicago, IL; Houston, TX; Miami, FL; and Philadelphia, PA. The study consisted of five components: (1) exploring the feasibility of expanded HIV testing via social mobilization and the universal offer of testing in hospital settings, (2) evaluating the effectiveness of financial incentives to increase linkage to care, (3) evaluating the effectiveness of financial incentives to increase viral suppression, (4) evaluating the effectiveness of a computer-delivered intervention to decrease risk behavior in HIV-positive patients in healthcare settings, and (5) administering provider and patient surveys to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding the use of antiretroviral therapy for prevention and the use of financial incentives to improve health outcomes. The study used observational cohorts, cluster and individual randomization, and made novel use of the existing national HIV surveillance data infrastructure. All components were developed with input from a community advisory board, and pragmatic methods were used to implement and assess the outcomes for each study component. Results A total of 76 sites in Washington, DC, and the Bronx, NY, participated in the study: 37 HIV test sites, including 16 hospitals, and 39 HIV care sites. Between September 2010 and December 2014, all study components were successfully implemented at these sites and resulted in valid outcomes. Our pragmatic approach to the study design, implementation, and the assessment of study outcomes allowed the study to be conducted within established programmatic structures and processes. In addition, it was successfully layered on the ongoing standard of care and existing data infrastructure without disrupting health services. Conclusion The HPTN 065 study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a multi-component ""test and treat"" trial that included a large number of community sites and involved pragmatic approaches to study implementation and evaluation."

3276,0.01,2.0000,"Previous cases of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been reported in the literature. The role of HIV in PH is still debatable. The purpose of this report was to analyze whether HIV plays a direct or indirect role in PH pathogenesis. Between February and November 1997, 56 HIV-infected patients with cardiac symptoms and signs were studied by serial color Doppler echocardiography. In four patients (7.1%), PH not related to other well-known associated conditions, was disclosed. In spite of a low serum HIV RNA viral load and a high-efficacy antiretroviral therapy, including a protease inhibitor in two patients, PH developed and worsened. It could be hypothesized that in some patients with an individual immunogenetic predisposition, a high secretion of cytokines and endothelin-1 stimulated by an unidentified pathogen different from HIV could lead to PH. Antiretroviral therapy seems not to prevent or reduce right ventricle pressure gradient in PH."
48,0.01,2.0000,"The polymerase chain reaction assay, branched DNA assay and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assay quantitate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA levels. Plasma viral load (PVL) testing has become a cornerstone of HIV disease management. Initiation of antiretroviral drug therapy is usually recommended when the PVL is 10,000 to 30,000 copies per mL or when CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts are less than 350 to 500 per mm3 (0.35 to 0.50 x 10(9) per L). PVL levels usually show a 1- to 2-log reduction within four to six weeks after therapy is started. The goal is no detectable virus in 16 to 24 weeks. Periodic monitoring of PVL is important to promptly identify treatment failure. When feasible, the same assay should be used for serial PVL testing in the individual patient. At least two PVL measurements usually should be performed before antiretroviral drug therapy is initiated or changed. PVL testing may be helpful in the rare instance of indeterminate HIV antibody testing, especially in a patient with recent infection."
4393,0.01,2.0000,"We investigated the prevalence of HIV-1-associated transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in Victoria from the time of first availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Drug resistance genotyping was performed on virus present in blood samples collected from individuals with serologically confirmed primary infection, between 1996 and 2007. The significance of any mutations detected was interpreted according to a standardised list of drug resistance mutations. The main outcomes measured were the prevalence by year of TDR to any antiretroviral drug class, the numbers of infected individuals with TDR involving multiple drug classes, and the resistance mutations implicated in all cases. There was an average annual prevalence of TDR of 16%, predominantly associated with nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors and most commonly occurring at codons 41, 103 and 215 in the RT. The prevalence of thymidine-associated mutations remained high throughout the period of study. While mutations known to cause resistance to protease inhibitors were uncommon, they were present in several individuals infected with virus resistant to multiple drug classes. The prevalence of TDR in Victoria is similar to geographical locations outside Australia where HIV-specific drug treatment is widely available. Primary infection with drug resistant HIV is a future treatment issue for the individual patient and for the wider population at risk of infection. At this time TDR shows no sign of waning and our data support recent treatment guidelines recommending baseline testing for TDR before therapy is initiated."

We analyzed data from the N2R study which was an open label, randomized, comparative trial comparing treatment outcomes between 71 TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients receiving efavirenz (EFV)-based and nevirapine (NVP)-based ART; all of whom were receiving RMP-containing anti-TB treatment. Demographic data, liver function test, CD4 cell count, plasma HIV-1 RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody were collected before initiating ART (week 0). Liver enzymes and total bilirubin levels were monitored at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after ART initiation. All patients were followed until TB therapy was completed. Of 142 patients, 8 patients were excluded. Among the remaining 134 patients, the mean+/-SD age was 36.8+/-8.6 years and 67.2% were male. Severe hepatotoxicity (grade 3 or 4) developed in 4 patients (2.9%); 3 patients (4.6%) in the NVP group and 1 patient (1.4%) in the EFV group. Severe hyperbilirubinemia (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 7 patients (5.2%); 5 patients (7.7%) in the NVP group and 2 patients (2.9%) in the EFV group. Grade 1 or 2 hepatotoxicity occurred in 34 patients (31.4%). Hepatitis C virus co-infection (adjusted OR 3.03; 95%CI 1.26-7.29) was an independent risk factor associated with grade 1-4 hepatotoxicity (p=0.013). Monitoring of hepatotoxicity should be considered in TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients who are infected with HCV and receiving NVP."
801,0.01,2.0000,"Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is recognised as an important component of collaborative tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activities to reduce the burden of TB in people living with HIV (PLHIV). However, there has been little in the way of IPT implementation at country level. This failure has resulted in a recent call to arms under the banner title of the 'Three I's' (infection control to prevent nosocomial transmission of TB in health care settings, intensified TB case finding and IPT). In this paper, we review the background of IPT. We then discuss the important challenges of IPT in PLHIV, namely responsibility and accountability for the implementation, identification of latent TB infection, exclusion of active TB and prevention of isoniazid resistance, length of treatment and duration of protective efficacy. We also highlight several research questions that currently remain unanswered. We finally offer practical suggestions about how to scale up IPT in the field, including the need to integrate IPT into a package of care for PLHIV, the setting up of operational projects with the philosophy of 'learning while doing', the development of flow charts for eligibility for IPT, the development and implementation of care prior to antiretroviral treatment, and finally issues around procurement, distribution, monitoring and evaluation. We support the implementation of IPT, but only if it is done in a safe and structured way. There is a definite risk that 'sloppy' IPT will be inefficient and, worse, could lead to the development of multidrug-resistant TB, and this must be avoided at all costs."
3629,0.01,2.0000,"Several studies have shown the importance of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in achieving HIV-1 suppression. However, most have focused on na√Øve patients and do not assess the impact of HAART on viral load (VL). Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of an adherence program in a cohort of multitreated and poorly adherent patients. We performed a cohort study of all adult HIV-1 infected patients with detectable VL who were treatment experienced and poorly adherent to HAART, included in an adherence program since its introduction in 2009 (n=136). The adherence program consisted of a multidisciplinary team with a nurse who specialized in behavioral intervention, counselling on substance abuse, and motivational interviewing, as well as a social worker responsible for referring patients to local healthcare centers. Effectiveness was evaluated as percentage of patients with VL <50 copies/mL at week 48 by modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis. Initially, 76.6% of the patients had an adherence <30% according to the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ). At 48 weeks, 48.1% of the patients had VL <50 copies/mL, and the adherence was >90% in 71% of the patients. In multivariate analysis, a ratio of bottle refill per month >0.9 during the study [odds ratio (OR) 14.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.08-50.08, p<0.001] and being on a b.i.d. regimen (OR 12.5; 95% CI 1.81-86.4, p=0.010) were associated with an undetectable VL. In conclusion, the adherence program was successful in almost half of the patients, despite their long treatment experience and prior poor adherence. This strategy may help to prevent disease progression and the risk of HIV transmission in these patients."
4173,0.01,2.0000,"HIV-1 group O infections remains essentially restricted to central Africa, and particularly Cameroon, although isolated cases have been reported in Western countries. Genomic differences explain why commercial tests used to quantify HIV-1 group M plasma load are unsuitable for HIV-1 group O. This lack of a quantitative tool hinders the clinical management of HIV-O-infected patients. We have therefore developed a real-time PCR assay, based on LightCycler technology, to quantify HIV-1 group O RNA in plasma. The primers were selected in the LTR 3' region. Forty-eight plasma samples containing strains belonging to the different HIV-1 type O clades (O:A, O:B and O:C) were tested. RNA was quantifiable in 40 of these samples. RNA was always detected in samples from untreated patients, except for one patient infected by a highly divergent strain. The kinetics of plasma viral load were also examined in seven patients for whom clinical and immunologic follow-up data were available. HIV-1 group O plasma load was high in the absence of treatment and correlated negatively with the CD4 cell count. Serial samples obtained during treatment allowed us to compare viral load changes with immunologic outcome. Despite the high initial cost of acquiring the required cycling device, the per-sample cost of this real-time quantitative PCR assay for HIV-1 group O is low, making it suitable for use in endemic zones."
8762,0.01,2.0000,"Abstract While the Internet has the potential to educate persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), websites may contain inaccurate information and increase the risk of nonadherence with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The objectives of our study were to determine the extent to which PLWHA engage in Internet health information seeking behavior (IHISB) and to determine whether IHISB is associated with ART adherence. We conducted a survey of adult, English-speaking HIV-infected patients at four HIV outpatient clinic sites in the United States (Baltimore, Maryland; Detroit, Michigan; New York, and Portland, Oregon) between December 2004 and January 2006. We assessed IHISB by asking participants how much information they had received from the Internet since acquiring HIV. The main outcome was patient-reported ART adherence over the past three days. Data were available on IHISB for 433 patients, 334 of whom were on ART therapy. Patients had a mean age of 45 (standard error [SE] 0.45) years and were mostly male (66%), African American (58%), and had attained a high school degree (73%). Most (55%) reported no IHISB, 18% reported some, and 27% reported ""a fair amount"" or ""a great deal."" Patients who reported higher versus lower levels of IHISB were significantly younger, had achieved a higher level of education, and had higher medication self-efficacy. In unadjusted analyses, higher IHISB was associated with ART adherence (odds ratio [OR], 2.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-6.94). This association persisted after adjustment for age, gender, race, education, clinic site, and medication self-efficacy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.76, 95% CI 1.11-6.87). Our findings indicate that IHISB is positively associated with ART adherence even after controlling for potentially confounding variables. Future studies should investigate the ways in which Internet health information may promote medication adherence among PLWHA."
4642,0.01,2.0000,"A nationwide hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination program for neonates was launched in Iran in 1993. Despite the success of this program, concern about its long-term success still remains, because breakthrough infections due to emergence of surface mutants have been reported in immunized children. We aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of HBV and vaccine escape mutants among individuals born after the initiation of the nationwide vaccination program in Iran. This study included 1115 participants younger than 23 years old, with 223 in each age cohort. The presence of HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc was evaluated using an ELISA kit. HBV-DNA levels were measured in anti-HBc and/or HBsAg-positive subjects. PCR products were sequenced and mutations were identified. The overall HBsAg prevalence was 0.27¬†%. Anti-HBs and anti-HBc positive rates were 48¬†% and 0.18¬†%, respectively. Two individuals were positive for anti-HBc, one of whom was also positive for HBsAg, and the other was positive for anti-HBc only. HBV DNA was detected in three out of four anti-HBc-and /or HBsAg-positive subjects. An I195M mutation within the S gene was detected in two of the three HBV-DNA-positive cases. A very low prevalence of HBsAg and isolated anti-HBc were found in this study. The I195M mutation found in the surface gene could have been induced by immune pressure. Although the number of ''vaccine escape'' mutants found in this cohort was low, ongoing surveillance of breakthrough infections and escape mutants is still needed."
8189,0.01,2.0000,"The purpose of this report is to determine the influence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic on medical students' training and career plans through a prospective, anonymous self-administered survey of 10 Likert-scaled (1 strongly agree to 5 strongly disagree) responses to statements assessing attitude toward patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adequacy of knowledge and experience with HIV, and influence of HIV on career choices. The study was done at a major AIDS referral university teaching hospital. The participants were first- through fourth-year medical students in spring 1990. A 72% (of 451 students) response revealed that both surgery and emergency medicine were perceived as high risk of exposure specialties. Students indicated an overall willingness to care for HIV-positive patients (mean, 2.54) and a general adequacy of knowledge and experience (mean 2.54). The AIDS epidemic has had little influence for training, future career, and practice locations (mean, 4.06). Responses differed by class year. The later class years were more willing to care for HIV patients (P < .001) and indicated more knowledge and experience with HIV (P < .001). Influence on career, training and practice location choices were without class trend. In contrast to some studies, this group of medical students had relatively positive attitudes toward patients with HIV and were not particularly influenced by the AIDS epidemic regarding career choices."
285,0.01,2.0000,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) are considered as key players in the global health scene. This study sought to determine the prevalence of TB among HIV-positive attendees of the Directly Observed Treatment of Short Course (DOTS) program at the military hospital in Port Harcourt. The association of HIV prevalence with gender and age as risk factors was also determined. A total of 200 patients aged 15-65¬†years were screened. Re-screening for HIV was done for confirmation. The overall prevalence for anti-TB antibodies amongst HIV-positive individuals was 14.0% (7.5% in males and 6.5% in females) while HIV prevalence following re-screening was 92%. It was observed that based on employment status and level of education, the highest HIV prevalence was seen in unemployed individuals and individuals with no formal education. The result showed that 29.9% of the HIV seropositives were males while 70.1% were females. Sex-related prevalence of HIV-TB coinfection within groups indicated significantly higher co-infection rates (P¬†<¬†0.05) among males (23.1%) than females (9.6%). Age-related prevalence of HIV-TB coinfection within groups showed that co-infection was significantly greater (P¬†<¬†0.05) in ages below 30¬†years (21.2%) than in their counterparts 30¬†years and above (9.6%). This study confirmed the presence of TB co-infections among HIV-positive individuals in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Considering the role of TB in driving the HIV pandemic, it is imperative that HIV-positive patients are screened for TB infection regularly to reduce the scale of active HIV-TB co-infection."
4804,0.01,2.0000,"CCR5 antagonists are a powerful new class of antiretroviral drugs that require a companion assay to evaluate the presence of CXCR4-tropic (non-R5) viruses prior to use in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. In this study, we have developed, characterized, verified, and prevalidated a novel phenotypic test to determine HIV-1 coreceptor tropism (VERITROP) based on a sensitive cell-to-cell fusion assay. A proprietary vector was constructed containing a near-full-length HIV-1 genome with the yeast uracil biosynthesis (URA3) gene replacing the HIV-1 env coding sequence. Patient-derived HIV-1 PCR products were introduced by homologous recombination using an innovative yeast-based cloning strategy. The env-expressing vectors were then used in a cell-to-cell fusion assay to determine the presence of R5 and/or non-R5 HIV-1 variants within the viral population. Results were compared with (i) the original version of Trofile (Monogram Biosciences, San Francisco, CA), (ii) population sequencing, and (iii) 454 pyrosequencing, with the genotypic data analyzed using several bioinformatics tools, i.e., the 11/24/25 rule, Geno2Pheno (2% to 5.75%, 3.5%, or 10% false-positive rate [FPR]), and webPSSM. VERITROP consistently detected minority non-R5 variants from clinical specimens, with an analytical sensitivity of 0.3%, with viral loads of ‚â•1,000 copies/ml, and from B and non-B subtypes. In a pilot study, a 73.7% (56/76) concordance was observed with the original Trofile assay, with 19 of the 20 discordant results corresponding to non-R5 variants detected using VERITROP and not by the original Trofile assay. The degree of concordance of VERITROP and Trofile with population and deep sequencing results depended on the algorithm used to determine HIV-1 coreceptor tropism. Overall, VERITROP showed better concordance with deep sequencing/Geno2Pheno at a 0.3% detection threshold (67%), whereas Trofile matched better with population sequencing (79%). However, 454 sequencing using Geno2Pheno at a 10% FPR and 0.3% threshold and VERITROP more accurately predicted the success of a maraviroc-based regimen. In conclusion, VERITROP may promote the development of new HIV coreceptor antagonists and aid in the treatment and management of HIV-infected individuals prior to and/or during treatment with this class of drugs."
7294,0.01,2.0000,"In 1989 the prevalence of hepatitis B virus markers was studied by radioimmunoassay in a sample of 1,426 healthy children, 3 to 11 years old, attending kindergarten and the primary schools in a large urban area of the Apulia Region in Southern Italy, where the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence among pregnant women is 5.6%. The overall prevalence of any hepatitis B virus marker was 3.4%, increasing from 1.7% in 3- to 5-year-old children to 5% in 10- to 11-year-old children (P less than 0.002). Prevalence was not associated with the father's years of schooling (odds ratio, 1.98; confidence interval, 95% (0.9 to 4.6] or with the family size (odds ratio, 2.96; confidence interval, (0.7 to 11.8]. The overall HBsAg prevalence was 0.8, a rate that was lower than the 5.6% found in pregnant women. The finding of only 12 HBsAg-positive children of the 1,426 tested, despite 80 of them being born to HBsAg-positive carrier mothers (on the basis of the 5.6% HBsAg prevalence among pregnant women), is probably attributable to the low proportion (5%) of hepatitis B e antigen positivity among the HBsAg-positive carrier mothers in the study area. The observed low HBV infection rate in younger age groups, which confirms recent studies in other areas of Italy, appears to be the result of several factors: improved socioeconomic conditions; decreased family size; and increased use of disposable syringes in the last few years."
2451,0.01,2.0000,"The aim of the study is to explore the evolution of genotypic mutations within the reverse transcriptase region in partial virological responders (PVRs) receiving long-term entecavir (ETV) treatment. A total of 32 patients were classified as completely virological responders (CVRs) (n‚Ää=‚Ää12) or PVRs (n‚Ää=‚Ää20). Five partial responders were hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA positive after long-term therapy, which lasted for >3 years. A total of 71 serum samples from these 32 patients were assayed by ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS): 32 samples were from all patients at baseline, and 39 were from PVRs with sequential inter-treatment. Approximately 84,708 sequences were generated per sample. At baseline, the quasispecies heterogeneity did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. The frequencies of substitutions indicating pre-existence of nucleos(t)ide analog resistant (NAr) mutants ranged from 0.10% to 6.70%, which did not statistically differ between groups either. However, the substitutions associated with the NAr mutants were significantly different from those associated with the non-NAr mutants in 13 patients; 6 of these patients were PVRs and the others were CVRs. Five patients were HBV DNA positive after regular ETV monotherapy for >3 years, and 4 of these patients underwent mild NAr substitution fluctuations (<20%). One patient developed virological breakthrough while bearing single, double, and triple (rtL180‚ÄäM, rtM204‚ÄäV, rtS202G) substitutions. In addition to the common substitutions, unknown amino acid substitutions, such as rtL145‚ÄäM/S, rtF151Y/L, rtR153Q, rtI224‚ÄäV, rtN248H, rtS223A, rtS256C, need to be further verified. NAr substitutions are observed at frequencies of 0.10% to 6.7% before therapy. Long-term ETV therapy generally results in virological responses, as long as the proportion of resistance mutations remains at a relatively low level. Genotypic resistance to ETV is detected in all PVRs receiving long-term ETV therapy."
9729,0.01,2.0000,"Molecular evolutionary patterns of 62 HBV full-length genomes obtained from Belgian patients were characterized. Phylogenetic analysis revealed diverse HBV subgenotypes including A2 and A6 (46.8%), D1-D4 (38.8%), E (9.7%), C1 (1.6%), and B2 (1.6%). The study population consisted of patients with different ethnic origin (Caucasian, Turkish, Asian, Arab, and African). One HBV D/C recombinant isolate was identified, which encoded subtype adw2. An HBV subgenotype D4 with an aberrant subtype ayw4 was detected. Although none of the genotypes was associated with a specific disease outcome, several nucleotide substitutions, deletions and insertions were observed within the HBV preS1/S and X genes, particularly among patients with active chronic hepatitis B infection and patients with cirrhosis. Within the immunological domain of the HBsAg gene, the most frequent substitutions were sT125M and sT118A. High rates of precore and basal core promoter mutations were detected in patients infected with genotype D of HBV. Almost half of the patients who received lamivudine therapy for at least 1 year had HBV variants associated with lamivudine drug resistance. In conclusion, the most common HBV genotypes in West Europe (A and D) also prevail in Belgium. The highest degree of genetic diversity was detected in HBV genotype D. In addition, this study reveals the circulation of exotic HBV genotypes B, C, and E in Belgium. J. Med. Virol. 82:379-389, 2010. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
8353,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) variants were selected for resistance to the (+) and (-) enantiomers of a novel nucleoside analogue, 2'-deoxy-3'-oxa-4'-thio-5-fluorocytidine (dOTFC), by use of the infectious molecular clone HIV HXB2D and the human T-cell line MT-4. The dOTFC-resistant variants that were selected were 10-fold less sensitive than wild-type virus, and cloning and sequencing of the complete reverse transcriptase (RT)-coding region identified the mutation M184V. Studies with mutated recombinant HXB2D virus confirmed the importance of the M184V mutation in conferring resistance to (-)dOTFC in MT-4 cells, although no difference in sensitivity was observed in primary cells. The M184V substitution also displayed decreased susceptibility to (+)dOTFC. Selection with (+)dOTFC also produced variants which were 10-fold more resistant than the wild type, and a novel mutation, D67G, was identified following cloning and sequencing of the RT genes. The D67G mutation was introduced into HXB2D by site-directed mutagenesis, and the data obtained confirmed the importance of this mutation in conferring resistance to both (+)dOTFC and (-)dOTFC. Mutated recombinant molecular clone HXB2D-D67G was further selected with (+)dOTFC, and three of six clones sequenced contained both the D67G and M184V mutations, while the other three of the six clones contained only the D67G mutation. Clinical isolates of HIV-1 which are (-) 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine-resistant also displayed resistance to both (+)dOTFC and (-)dOTFC."
7394,0.01,2.0000,"In the USA and West Europe, nearly 80% of HIV-1-infected adults, experiencing virologic failure, harbored virus strain resistant to at least one antiretroviral drug. Limited data are available on antiretroviral drug resistance in pediatric HIV infection. The aims of this study were to analyze prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and to identify risk factors associated with resistance in this population. Prevalence of genotypic resistance was estimated retrospectively in treated children who experienced virologic failure (with HIV-1-RNA > 500 copies/ml) followed in Necker hospital between 2001 and 2003. Among 119 children with resistance testing, prevalence of resistance to any drug was 82.4%. Resistance ranged from 76.5% to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), to 48.7% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and 42.9% to protease inhibitor (PI). Resistance to at least one drug of two classes and three classes (triple resistance) was 31.9 and 26.9%, respectively. Resistance was not associated with geographic origin, HIV-1 subtype, and CDC status. In multivariate analysis, resistance to any drug remained associated independently with current low viral load and high lifetime number of past PI. Triple resistance was independently associated with the high lifetime number of past PI and with gender, particularly among children aged 11 years old or more with a prevalence seven times higher in boys than in girls. In conclusion, antiretroviral resistance is common among treated HIV-1-infected children and prevalence was similar with those observed in adult population in the same year period. However, adolescent boys seem to be at greater risk."
7236,0.01,2.0000,"Tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione (TIBO) derivatives were shown to specifically block human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication through a unique interaction with the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Through further modification of the lead compounds and structure-activity relationship analysis several new TIBO derivatives that show high potency, selectivity, and specificity against HIV-1 have been obtained. A new TIBO derivative, R86183, inhibits the replication of HIV-1, but not HIV-2, in a variety of CD4+ T-cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes, at a concentration of 0.3 to 30 nM, which is at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than the 50% cytotoxic concentration. Whereas an HIV-1 strain containing the Leu-100-->Ile mutation in the RT gene is about 400-fold less susceptible, R86183 still inhibits the replication of an HIV-1 strain containing the Tyr-181-->Cys RT mutation by 50% at a concentration of 130 nM. R86183 inhibits the poly(C).oligo(dG)12-18-directed HIV-1 RT reaction by 50% at a concentration of 57 nM. The antiviral activity of 22 TIBO derivatives in cell culture correlated well with their activity against HIV-1 RT. No such correlation was found for their cytotoxicity. The combination of R86183 with either zidovudine or didanosine resulted in a synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 (strain IIIB) replication. Combination of R86183 with the protease inhibitor Ro31-8959 was found to be additive. Also described is a dilution protocol circumventing overestimation and underestimation of antiviral activity due to adherence to plastic surfaces."

To make associations with epidemiological parameters, clinical-immune status, viral load and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we performed a cross-sectional study in HIV-infected children. Epidemiological parameters (age, sex, family history), clinical and immune status, viral load, and duration of antiretroviral treatment (ART) and HAART, including protease inhibitors, were recorded. Presence of clinical signs of fat redistribution and lipid, glucose and lactic acid levels were evaluated. A total of 56 HIV-infected children, including 30 boys (54%), aged between 21 months and 18 years (mean 9.5 years) were studied. In all, 49 patients (87.5%) were receiving ART (mean duration 4 years) and 43 (77%) were receiving HAART (mean duration 3.6 years). Fat redistribution or lipodystrophy was present in 14 patients (25%); seven had lipohypertrophy (12.5%), two lipoatrophy (3.5%) and five a mixed pattern (8.9%). Fat redistribution was higher in children older than 11 years (50%). Of the lipodystrophic patients, 71.4% presented hypertriglyceridaemia (> 130 mg/dl) and 57% hypercholesterolaemia (> 180 mg/dl). We found significant associations between lipodystrophy and age, ART and HAART duration and hypertriglyceridaemia ( P < 0.001, 0.002, 0.016 and < 0.001, respectively), but no significant association with sex, family history, clinical or immune status and viral load."
7540,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The likelihood of developing CHB is related to the age at which infection is acquired; the risk being lowest in adults and >90% in neonates whose mothers are hepatitis B e antigen positive. Treatment of CHB infection aims to clear HBV DNA and prevent the development of complications. There are currently seven drugs available for the treatment of CHB: five nucleos(t)ide analogues and two interferon-based therapies. Long-term treatment is often required, and the decision to treat is based on clinical assessment including the phase of CHB infection and the presence and extent of liver damage. A safe and effective HBV vaccine has been available since the early 1980s. Vaccination plays a central role in HBV prevention strategies worldwide, and a decline in the incidence and prevalence of HBV infection following the introduction of universal HBV vaccination programmes has been observed in many countries including the USA and parts of South East Asia and Europe. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with HBV vaccine +/- hepatitis B immunoglobulin is highly effective in preventing mother to child transmission and in preventing transmission following sharps injuries, sexual contact and other exposures to infected blood and body fluids. Transmission of HBV in the health care setting has become an increasingly rare event in developed nations. However, it remains a significant risk in developing countries reflecting the higher prevalence of CHB, limited access to HBV vaccination and PEP and a lack of adherence to standard infection control precautions."

We provisionally named this mutation a ""replacement mutation""; the core promoter upstream regulatory sequence/basic core promoter was replaced with a part of the S1 promoter covering the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) binding site, followed by a tandem repeat of the HNF1 site. A longitudinal analysis of the HBV population over 6 years showed the clonal change from wild-type HBV/E to replacement-mutant type, resulting in a lower hepatitis B (HB) e antigen titer, a high HBV DNA level in serum, and progression of liver fibrosis. In an in vitro study using a replication model, the replacement-mutant HBV showed higher replication levels than the wild-type HBV/E replicon, probably mediated by altered transcription factor binding. Additionally, this HNF1 site replacement mutation was associated with excessive HB nucleocapsid protein expression in hepatocytes, in both in vivo and in vitro studies. This novel mutation may be specific to HBV genotype E, and its prevalence requires further investigation."
5669,0.01,2.0000,"The demand for dental treatment by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals is rising. Some professionals are still reluctant to treat these patients, despite the extremely low likelihood of professional transmission, which increases only in patients with a very elevated viral load. The complications rate after dental intervention is very low, even in patients with considerable immunologic deterioration. The dentist should pay special attention to the general clinical situation and immunologic and HIV virologic status of the seropositive patient, and to the presence of hemostasis alterations or of other concomitant diseases. Antiretroviral or any other drug treatments must also be recorded, in order to avoid possible interactions with clinician-prescribed drugs. Tooth extraction is the most common dental treatment and requires no antibiotic therapy except in cases of neutropenia or severe immunosuppression. Other dental treatments do not require special precautions, and the complications index among these patients is similar to that among the uninfected patient population. With this background, there is a need to make the clinician-in-training aware of the importance of regular dental health checkups as part of the health care routine of HIV-infected patients and to familiarize the clinician with their management, while not disregarding the unquestionable requirement to carry out the general and specific prevention measures to be adopted in all cases."
3297,0.01,2.0000,"RT-SHIV is a chimera of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) containing the reverse transcriptase (RT)-encoding region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) within the backbone of SIVmac239. It has been used in a non-human primate model for studies of non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTI) and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We and others have identified several mutations that arise in the ""foreign"" HIV-1 RT of RT-SHIV during in vivo replication. In this study we catalogued amino acid substitutions in the HIV-1 RT and in regions of the SIV backbone with which RT interacts that emerged 30 weeks post-infection from seven RT-SHIV-infected rhesus macaques. The virus set points varied from relatively high virus load, moderate virus load, to undetectable virus load. The G196R substitution in RT was detected from 6 of 7 animals at week 4 post-infection and remained in virus from 4 of 6 animals at week 30. Virus from four high virus load animals showed several common mutations within RT, including L74V or V75L, G196R, L214F, and K275R. The foreign RT from high virus load isolates exhibited as much variation as that of the highly variable envelope surface glycoprotein, and 10-fold higher than that of the native RT of SIVmac239. Isolates from moderate virus load animals showed much less variation in the foreign RT than the high virus load isolates. No variation was found in SIVmac239 genes known to interact with RT. Our results demonstrate substantial adaptation of the foreign HIV-1 RT in RT-SHIV-infected macaques, which most likely reflects selective pressure upon the foreign RT to attain optimal activity within the context of the chimeric RT-SHIV and the rhesus macaque host.

1754,0.01,2.0000,"The Russian federation has been undergoing a concentrated epidemic of HIV-1 with high rates of infection among injecting drug users. Less is known about the relative risk and contribution to the country's HIV epidemic by other at-risk populations including sex workers and men who have sex with men. The goals of this project were to explore demographic characteristics, substance use patterns, and estimate the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and high-risk behaviors among male sex workers (MSW) in Moscow and to assess the feasibility of prospective cohort recruitment and retention among this population. Research design was a longitudinal study of 50 men with a six-month follow-up period. Participants were recruited through venue-based and snowball sampling methods. Results revealed an HIV prevalence at baseline of 16%; one MSW seroconverted during the follow-up period, yielding an incidence estimate of 4.8/100PY (95%CI 0.0-11.2). Twenty-four percentage were diagnosed with at least one STI: 12% had syphilis; 8% had Human Papilloma Virus (HPV); and 4% had Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-2. Three (6%) of the study participants had evidence of previous Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) exposure at baseline. Retention rates were poor with higher retention significantly associated with older men (OR: 13.1, 95% CI 3.3-52.5). This was the first study to evaluate baseline demographics, substance use patterns, and prevalence of infectious disease among MSW in Moscow. Identification and recruitment of this population appears to be feasible, but retention a challenge. While the sample size in the current study was small, the results also suggested that this is a population at considerable high risk for HIV. MSW in Moscow may be an important at-risk population in the Russian HIV epidemic and further research is urgently required to address their needs and explore prevention strategies."
7533,0.01,2.0000,"HIV-positive individuals who use injection drugs (IDU) may have lower rates of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, previous studies of factors associated with adherence to ART among IDU have been limited primarily to samples drawn from clinical settings and in areas with financial barriers to healthcare.We evaluated patterns of ART adherence and rates of plasma HIV RNA response among a Canadian cohort of community-recruited IDU. Using data from a community-recruited cohort of antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected IDU, we investigated ART adherence patterns based on prescription refill compliance and factors associated with time to plasma HIV-1 RNA suppression (<500 copies/mL) using Cox proportional hazards regression in a setting with universal health care, including free ART. Between 1996 and 2008, 267 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected IDU initiated ART and had a median of 51 months (inter-quartile range: 17-95 months) of follow-up. Overall, 81 (30.3%) were ‚â•95% adherent during the first year of HAART and 187 (70.0%) achieved HIV RNA suppression at least once over the study period, for an incidence-density of 34.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.8-39.9) per 100 person-years. The Kaplan-Meier cumulative plasma HIV RNA suppression rates at 12 months after the initiation of ART were 80.8% (95% CI: 71.2-88.7) for adherent and 28.9% (95% CI: 22.8-36.1) for non-adherent participants. While several socio-demographic characteristics and drug-using behaviours were identified as barriers to successful treatment in unadjusted analyses, the factor most strongly associated with time to HIV RNA suppression in multivariate analysis was adherence to ART of at least 95% (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 6.0, 95% CI: 4.2-8.6, p<0.001). These results demonstrate low rates of adherence to ART among a community-recruited cohort of IDU and reinforce the importance of adherence as the key determinant of successful virological response to antiretroviral therapy."
7221,0.01,2.0000,"Delivery by elective cesarean section (ECS), cesarean section prior to labor and rupture of membranes, is associated with a lower rate of vertical transmission of HIV compared with other modes of delivery. The efficacy of ECS among women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy or among women with low viral loads is unknown. In assessing the possible utility of ECS as an intervention to decrease vertical transmission in the United States and other countries, the potential risks associated with operative delivery as well as other considerations should also be addressed. Although cesarean section delivery is associated with an increased rate of postpartum morbidity compared with vaginal delivery in the general population, operative delivery performed emergently carries a higher risk of complications than scheduled or elective procedures. Analyses of the risk of postpartum morbidity according to mode of delivery among HIV-infected women have been performed in the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the largest database in North America with relevant data, as well as other, smaller databases. These analyses suggest a similar pattern to that observed in the general population. In addition to quantifying the incidence of postpartum morbidity events, it is also important to distinguish between minor and major morbidity. Neonatal morbidity related to ECS is generally due to iatrogenic preterm birth, that is, situations where the gestational age is not accurately assessed prior to delivery. Occupationally acquired HIV infection related to obstetric procedures is a possibility, although risk related to mode of delivery is unknown. The results of economic analyses of ECS compared to vaginal delivery in the US indicate that ECS is a cost-effective intervention in preventing vertical transmission of HIV among women who refrain from breastfeeding. However, more precise estimates of the risk of vertical transmission among women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and of the potential risks of maternal and pediatric adverse events related to receipt of such therapy are needed. In summary, the benefit of ECS must be weighed against potential risks, and issues such as cost-effectiveness also should be taken into consideration."
3097,0.01,2.0000,"We have studied 18 participants in phase I/II clinical trials of recombinant gp120 (rgp120) subunit vaccines (MN and SF-2) who became infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) during the course of the trials. Of the 18 individuals, 2 had received a placebo vaccine, 9 had been immunized with MN rgp120, and seven had been immunized with SF-2 rgp120. Thirteen of the 18 infected vaccinees had received three or four immunizations prior to becoming infected. Of these, two were placebo recipients, six had received MN rgp120, and five had received SF-2 rgp120. Only 1 of the 11 rgp120 recipients who had multiple immunizations failed to develop a strong immunoglobulin G antibody response to the immunogen. However, the antibody response to rgp120 was transient, typically having a half-life of 40 to 60 days. No significant neutralizing activity against the infecting strain was detected in any of the infected individuals at any time prior to infection. Antibody titers in subjects infected despite vaccination and in noninfected subjects were not significantly different. Envelope-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses measured after infection were infrequent and weak in the nine vaccinees who were tested. HIV-1 was isolated successfully from all 18 individuals. Sixteen of these strains had a non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) phenotype, while two had a syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype. NSI strains used the CCR5 coreceptor to enter CD4+ cells, while an SI strain from one of the vaccinees also used CXCR4. Viruses isolated from the blood of rgp120 vaccinees were indistinguishable from viruses isolated from control individuals in terms of their inherent sensitivity to neutralization by specific monoclonal antibodies and their replication rates in vitro. Furthermore, genetic sequencing of the env genes of strains infecting the vaccinees did not reveal any features that clearly distinguished these viruses from contemporary clade B viruses circulating in the United States. Thus, despite rigorous genetic analyses, using various breakdowns of the data sets, we could find no evidence that rgp120 vaccination exerted selection pressure on the infecting HIV-1 strains. The viral burdens in the infected rgp120 vaccine recipients were also determined, and they were found to be not significantly different from those in cohorts of placebo-vaccinated and nonvaccinated individuals. In summary, we conclude that vaccination with rgp120 has had,to date, no obvious beneficial or adverse effects on the individuals we have studied."
5673,0.01,2.0000,"Initiation of efavirenz-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is associated with Vitamin D deficiency, but the risk factors including efavirenz pharmacokinetics for cART-induced severe vitamin D deficiency (SVDD) and the impact of anti-tuberculosis (TB) cotreatment are not explored. We investigated the prevalence of SVDD in HIV and TB-HIV coinfected patients and associated risk factors for treatment-induced SVDD.Treatment-na√Øve Ethiopian HIV patients with (n‚Ää=‚Ää102) or without (n‚Ää=‚Ää89) TB co-infection were enrolled prospectively and received efavirenz-based cART. In TB-HIV coinfected patients, rifampicin-based anti-TB treatment was initiated 4 or 8 weeks before starting cART. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D), cholesterol and 4-beta hydroxycholesterol concentrations were measured at baseline, 4, 16, and 48 week of cART. Plasma efavirenz concentrations were determined at 4 and 16 weeks of cART.TB-HIV patients had significantly lower plasma 25 (OH)D3 levels than HIV-only patients at baseline. TB co-infection, low Karnofsky score, high viral load, and high CYP3A activity as measured by plasma 4Œ≤-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratios were significant predictors of low 25 (OH)D3 levels at baseline. In HIV-only patients, initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVVD from 27% at baseline to 76%, 79%, and 43% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively. The median 25 (OH)D3 levels declined from baseline by -40%, -50%, and -14% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively.In TB-HIV patients, previous anti-TB therapy had no influence on 25 (OH)D3 levels, but the initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVDD from 57% at baseline to 70% and 72% at the 4 and 16 weeks of cART, respectively. Median plasma 25 (OH)D3 declined from baseline by -17% and -21% at week 4 and 16 of cART, respectively.Our results indicate low plasma cholesterol, high CYP3A activity, and high plasma efavirenz concentrations as significant predictors of early efavirenz-based cART-induced vitamin D deficiency. Low plasma 25 (OH)D3 level at baseline is associated with TB co-infection and HIV diseases progression. Initiation of efavirenz-based cART is associated with high incidence of SVDD, whereas rifampicin based anti-TB therapy co-treatment has no significant effect. Supplementary vitamin D during cART initiation may be beneficial for HIV patients regardless of TB coinfection. "
325,0.01,2.0000,"The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with tuberculosis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons living in Switzerland, a country with low prevalence of tuberculous infection. We performed a nested case-control study and logistic regression. Cases (n = 239) were patients participating in the Swiss-HIV Cohort study (n = 7,103), diagnosed with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis. The rest of the cohort population was used as control. Patients from industrialized countries had a risk of tuberculosis similar to those from Switzerland (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.7-1.5); whereas the risk among patients from Eastern Europe (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.9-3.7), Brazil (OR 10.6; 95% CI 9.6-11.5), and Africa (OR 3.0; 95% CI 2.4-3.6) was markedly higher. Immune suppression, as indicated by low CD4 + cell count, was an independent risk factor for tuberculosis (OR 7.8; 95% CI 7.3-8.3 for patients with CD4 + < 50 cells.mm-3 compared to those with CD4 + > 500 cells.mm-3). Age, sex and HIV-transmission category did not appear to increase the risk of tuberculosis after adjustment for other patient characteristics. In conclusion, in countries of low prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, to originate from a country with high prevalence of tuberculosis infection and to have advanced immunodeficiency are significant risk factors for tuberculosis. They may be used to complement the tuberculin skin test in targeting patients for preventive chemotherapy."
8390,0.01,2.0000,"Over the previous years, comprehensive studies on antiretroviral drugs resulted in the successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) into clinical practice for treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there is still need for new therapeutic approaches, since HAART cannot eradicate HIV-1 from the infected organism and, unfortunately, can be associated with long-term toxicity and the development of drug resistance. In contrast, novel gene therapy strategies may have the potential to reverse the infection by eradicating HIV-1. For example, expression of long terminal repeat (LTR)-specific recombinase (Tre-recombinase) has been shown to result in chromosomal excision of proviral DNA and, in consequence, in the eradication of HIV-1 from infected cell cultures. However, the delivery of Tre-recombinase currently depends on the genetic manipulation of target cells, a process that is complicating such therapeutic approaches and, thus, might be undesirable in a clinical setting. In this report we demonstrate that E.coli expressed Tre-recombinases, tagged either with the protein transduction domain (PTD) from the HIV-1 Tat trans-activator or the translocation motif (TLM) of the Hepatitis B virus PreS2 protein, were able to translocate efficiently into cells and showed significant recombination activity on HIV-1 LTR sequences. Tre activity was observed using episomal and stable integrated reporter constructs in transfected HeLa cells. Furthermore, the TLM-tagged enzyme was able to excise the full-length proviral DNA from chromosomal integration sites of HIV-1-infected HeLa and CEM-SS cells. The presented data confirm Tre-recombinase activity on integrated HIV-1 and provide the basis for the non-genetic transient application of engineered recombinases, which may be a valuable component of future HIV eradication strategies."
4386,0.01,2.0000,"Implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has deeply changed the landscape of HIV-associated malignancies. Some AIDS-defining tumors, namely Primitive Lymphoma of Central Nervous System, have drastically declined, whereas a steady increase has been observed for non-AIDS-defining tumors, maybe due to longer survival of HIV-infected people. Easier immune restoration, subsequent to availability of a number of drugs targeting HIV at different points, has decreased opportunistic infections which hampered treatment of HIV-associated cancers. As a matter of fact these patients have been assimilated more and more with their negative counterpart, undergoing the same aggressive approach. Consistently, procedures that have been so far precluded to HIV+ subjects, such as transplant of hemopoietic stem cells, either autologous or allogenic, and liver transplant are expected to be performed more and more extensively in this population. Which also would mean a full removal of the stigma which has weighed on it. Hence, it is true-like that malignancies and related problems may in the next future make up a main concern for the HIV specialist. Old and new challenges might be the drug-drug interaction of antiretrovirals or biotherapy-related infections or the debated question of an earlier HAART implementation in the course of HIV disease, with CD4+ cells > 500/Œºl. In fact, if assimilation of HIV patients with cancer and the general population is a remarkable achieved goal, uniqueness of HIV infection in terms of immune status still makes HIV-associated cancer a unique chapter in the setting of Oncology."
7014,0.01,2.0000,"Recently a new field of immunological research and clinical application of vaccines for therapeutic purposes (vaccine therapy) has been developed for treating several chronic viral infections including chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Administration of vaccine containing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for 1 year has resulted in negative HBsAg and development of antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) in some, but not in all, HBV transgenic mouse (HBV-Tg). In order to develop more potent regimen of vaccine therapy for chronic HBV carrier, we prepared a dendritic cell (DC)-based therapeutic vaccine and evaluated their therapeutic potential in HBV-Tg. DCs were isolated from single cell suspensions of murine spleen cells by collagenase digestion, density centrifugation and depletion of lymphocytes. Spleen DCs were cultured with HBsAg (100 microg) for 24 h to produce HBsAg-pulsed DCs. HBV-Tg expressing HBsAg and HBV DNA in the sera were randomly assigned to receive either HBsAg-pulsed DCs (n = 20) or unpulsed DC (n = 20) or vaccine containing HBsAg (n = 39) or complete Freund's adjuvant (n = 20) or left untreated (n = 20). Only two intraperitoneal injections of HBsAg-pulsed DCs resulted in negative HBsAg and production of anti-HBs in the sera in all HBV-Tg (n = 20). However, administration of un-pulsed DCs (n = 20) or vaccine containing HBsAg (n = 39) or only complete Freund's adjuvant did not induce negative HBsAg or production of anti-HBs in any HBV-Tg within 6 months of therapy commencement. Taken together, this study showed that HBsAg-pulsed DCs represent a highly potent therapeutic vaccine for chronic HBV infection and inspire optimism of using this vaccine in clinical conditions. A clinical trial of HBsAg-pulsed DC in patients with chronic hepatitis B is warranted."
1912,0.01,2.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is characterized by the presence of HBV DNA in serum and/or in the liver of patients negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Occult infection may impact in several different clinical contexts including the risk of HBV transmission with transfusion or transplantation, and endogenous viral reactivation. The gold standard test for detection of occult infection is the amplification of HBV DNA. However, the serological assay for the long-lasting antibody response to the highly immunogenic HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) represents a qualified candidate as a surrogate for DNA amplification, or for increasing overall sensitivity when assessing the risk of occult hepatitis in peripheral blood. The risk of occult hepatitis associated with anti-HBc seropositivity has been demonstrated extensively, and the presence of antibody response to HBc can be considered a sentinel marker of occult HBV infection."
6130,0.01,2.0000,"Drug-resistant mutants with a methionine-to-valine substitution at position 184 of reverse transcriptase (M184V) emerged within 5 weeks of initiation of therapy in four newborn macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac251) and treated with lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine [(-)-FTC] (two animals per drug). Thus, this animal model mimics the rapid emergence of M184V mutants of HIV-1 during 3TC therapy of human patients. One animal of each treatment group developed fatal immunodeficiency at 12 weeks of age, which is similar to the rapid disease course seen in most untreated SIVmac251-infected infant macaques. To further evaluate the effect of the M184V mutation on viral fitness and virulence, groups of juvenile macaques were inoculated with the molecular clone SIVmac239 with either the wild-type sequence (group A [n = 5]) or the M184V sequence (SIVmac239-184V; group B [n = 5] and group C [n = 2]). The two SIVmac239-184V-infected animals of group C did not receive any drug treatment, and in both animals the virus population reverted to predominantly wild type (184M) by 8 weeks after inoculation. The other five SIVmac239-184V-infected animals (group B) were treated with (-)-FTC to prevent reversion. Although virus levels 1 week after inoculation were lower in the SIVmac239-184V-infected macaques than in the SIVmac239-infected animals, no significant differences were observed from week 2 onwards. Two animals in each group developed AIDS and were euthanized, while all other animals were clinically stable at 46 weeks of infection. These data demonstrate that the M184V mutation in SIV conferred a slightly reduced fitness but did not affect disease outcome."

RI were documented seroconverters, or people with an HIV avidity index (AI)<0.80. Individuals with advanced infection (CD4 count <200 cells/?L or AIDS-defining illness) or with AI ?0.80 were considered long-standing infections. Overall, we observed 2,563 new HIV diagnoses. The algorithm was applied in 2124/2563 (82.9%). Of these, 355 were RI (16.7%). RI was found independently associated with calendar year (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]= 1.06, 95% confidence intervals [CI]=[CI 1.02-1.11], for every year of increase), HIV-risk category (men having sex with men: aOR=1.44, [CI 1.04-1.98]; injecting drug users: aOR=1.58, [CI 1.03-2.42] vs. heterosexuals), country of origin (foreign-born: vs Italians: aOR=0.46, [CI 0.33-0.62]), and recruitment site (inpatient vs outpatient clinic: aOR=0.49, [CI 0.37-0.66]). By the application of our algorithm we could characterize the pattern of ongoing HIV transmission, identifying groups needing more urgent prevention programs."
4832,0.01,2.0000,"Hydroxyurea (HU) has preferential activity in virus reservoirs not effectively targeted by current antiretroviral drug regimens, but concern for potential toxicity has precluded its routine use. The effect of adjunct HU on T cell proliferative responses and phenotypic markers was examined in a randomized study of 39 chronically HIV-1-infected patients with virological suppression on potent antiretroviral therapy. While patients in the HU arm showed modest declines in the median CD4(+) T cell counts (total, -151 cells/mm(3); naive, -91 cells/mm(3)), no significant differences were noted in the Candida, HIV-1 p24, and HIV-1 gp160 responses between the treatment arms following 24 weeks of therapy. In conclusion, although adjunct HU was associated with modest declines in the CD4(+) T cell counts, there was no significant adverse effect on helper T cell function. Further trials to address the role of HU in HIV-1 treatment may be appropriate after careful selection of HU dose and the adjunct drugs to avoid nonhematological toxicity."
1551,0.01,2.0000,"This exploratory analyses characterizes patterns of lymphocyte recovery in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and investigates their relationship with baseline indices and virologic responses. We modeled kinetics of total CD4+ lymphocytes, as well as naive (CD45RA+ CD62L+), and memory (CD45RA- CD45RO+) subsets in 48 patients treated with AZT/3TC/Ritonavir for 48 weeks in ACTG protocol 315. Cell kinetic indices were estimated by nonlinear regression methods and were correlated with baseline factors and virologic responses. Five different kinetic patterns were identified, including biphasic growth, growth-plateau, growth-depletion, decay-recovery, and biphasic decay. Although overall mean lymphocyte responses showed a biphasic increase in cell number, a careful investigation reveals that only one-third of patients actually followed the biphasic growth pattern in CD4+ cell response, while 44% of 48 patients from this study followed the growth-depletion pattern. CD4+ cell recovery during the first phase and the 48-week study period were negatively correlated with baseline CD4+ cell counts, and positively correlated with baseline viral load. Memory CD4+ cell recovery during the first phase was also negatively correlated with baseline memory CD4+ and total CD4+ cell number, but the recovery rate of memory CD4+ cells during the second phase was positively correlated with baseline CD4+ cell number. Patients with a decay in CD4+ cell count during treatment were more likely to have experienced virological rebound (58%) than patients with nondecay patterns (24%). The rate and magnitude of the absolute increase in total CD4+ and memory CD4+ cell number (but not naive CD4+ cells) during the second phase were lower in patients with viral rebound compared with patients with persistent viral suppression. These results show that the kinetics of lymphocyte reconstitution in response to potent antiretroviral therapy in individual patients vary considerably from the ""classic"" biphasic increase that characterizes the mean or median response pattern. Pattern analysis of lymphocyte kinetics may be useful for testing relationships among factors that modulate the response to treatment."
4123,0.01,2.0000,"To examine the genetic relatedness of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) from different geographic locations, we molecularly cloned the genome of HIV isolated from a Zairian AIDS patient. Restriction mapping of the recombinant clone, designated HIV-Zr6, revealed both common (as observed in other HIV isolates) and unique restriction sites. The DNA clone of HIV-Zr6, shown to give rise to infectious cytopathic virus after transfection of cultured lymphoid cells, was sequenced in several regions. The long terminal repeat (LTR), open reading frame 1 (ORF1), C-terminal envelope (env) gene domain, and ORF2 showed less than 6% difference in nucleotide sequence when compared to other HIV isolates including human T-lymphotropic virus-type III (HTLV-III) clone B10, lymphadenopathy-associated virus-1 (LAV-1), and AIDS-associated retrovirus-2 (ARV-2). About 15% difference in nucleotide sequences was noted in the N-terminal env gene domain. Alignments of env gene sequences revealed conserved, moderately variable, and hypervariable stretches in the predicted amino acid sequences. This model provides a basis for assessing the significance of sequence variation on properties controlled by the viral Env glycoproteins such as cell tropism and immunogenicity."

Many cross-sectional studies have been conducted on anemia and HIV, but few, if any, have addressed incidence of anemia prospectively. A longitudinal analysis was conducted in 48,068 nonpregnant HIV-infected adults in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, seen at Management and Development for Health-U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief HIV care and treatment programs between 2004 and 2011. Almost 56% (N = 27,184) of study participants had anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) at the time of enrollment at the clinic. Female gender, low body mass index (BMI), low CD4 T-cell count, high levels of liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase, antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens, and concurrent tuberculosis treatment were all independently significantly associated with an increased risk of anemia. Low BMI and low CD4 T-cell count were independently significantly associated with an increased risk for iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Higher BMI status and ART use were associated with recovery from anemia. Anemia, including IDA, is a comorbidity that is associated with other adverse consequences (e.g., low BMI and CD4 T-cell count) among individuals with HIV infection, including those on ART. Interventions to prevent anemia and its complications need to be examined in the context of future studies. "

Initial adherence measured as initial coverage ratio (ICR) and long-term adherence measured as thereafter 1-year proportion days covered (PDC) of base agent and complete regimen were estimated for each patient. The patients most likely to exhibit poor adherence were African-American, with lower socioeconomic status, and healthier. The initial coverage ratio of base agent and complete regimen were highly correlated, but the correlations between ICR and thereafter 1-year PDC were low. However, including initial adherence as a predictor in predictive model would substantially increase predictive accuracy of future adherence."

Of the 200 (90.5%) patients with anti-HCV-positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results, 152 (76%) were RIBA reactive, 47 (23.5%) had indeterminate results, and 1 (0.5%) was nonreactive. Of the 180 (90%) patients positive for anti-HCV and HCV RNA, 138 (76.7%) were RIBA reactive and 42 (23.3%) were RIBA indeterminate. The pattern of RIBA reactivity did not correlate with the presence of HCV RNA. Elevated alanine aminotransferase levels were associated neither with the presence of viremia nor with the RIBA pattern. Histological findings consistent with non-A non-B hepatitis correlated with the presence of HCV RNA but not with the RIBA pattern. HCV RNA was detected in 11 of 21 (52.4%) anti-HCV-negative patients. These 11 patients were either immunosuppressed or in the prodromic phase of acute hepatitis C. Circulating HCV RNA can therefore be described as being predictive of virus-induced liver damage in anti-HCV-positive patients and may be useful in the diagnosis of HCV infection in anti-HCV-negative immunosuppressed patients or in those with early acute infection."
6182,0.01,2.0000,"Despite a decade of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity, a few individuals termed as long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs) maintain a stable CD4+ T-cell count for a period of time. The aim of this study was to establish, through the sequential determination of all known predictors of HIV disease, the proportion of such patients having stringent criteria of true long-term nonprogression. Among 249 individuals who were HIV-infected and prospectively followed up over a 10-year period (1985 to 1995), 12 having a CD4+ T-cell count greater than 500/microL (LTNP I group) and 9 having a CD4+ T-cell count less than 500 but stable over time (LTNP II group) after at least 10 years of infection without intervention of antiviral therapy, were studied over the entire follow-up period. The plasma HIV RNA copy number and the serum concentrations of p24 antigen, each anti-HIV antibody, neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin, Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA were determined every 18 months over the study period. Cellular and plasma viremias were cross-sectionaly assayed in all 21 patients. Only two patients had strictly no marker of progression over the follow-up period. They were the only ones who had, over the 10-year period, a viral copy number too low to be detected. The other patients had a viral copy number higher than 400/mL at at least one visit and increasing over the follow-up period, and they evidenced one or more markers of virological or immunological deterioration. Cellular viremia was positive in all patients but two, while plasma viremia was negative in all but one. The population of individuals termed as LTNPs is not virologically and immunologically homogeneous. The majority present biological signs of HIV disease progression. A new pattern of true LTNP can be drawn through stringent criteria based on the whole known predictors. This pattern appears to be rare in HIV-positive population."
2034,0.01,2.0000,"Due to their shared transmission route, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infections can be observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cases and are associated with more severe clinical courses. The detection of HBV DNA despite HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seronegativity is defined as occult HBV infections. According to the current seroepidemiological data, Turkey is classified as an intermediate HBV, low HIV endemic region. Occult HBV infections have previously been reported from Turkey but has not been investigated previously in HIV infected cohorts. The aim of this study was to identify occult HBV infections in HIV-infected persons. Twenty-eight HIV-positive cases followed-up at Hacettepe University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Unit were included in the study after informed consent. For the detection of HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HCV, commercial ELISA tests (Architect System, Abbott Diagnostics, USA) were employed. Absolute CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined via flow cytometry. HIV viral load was calculated via COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA) and the presence of HBV DNA was evaluated via COBAS TaqMan HBV Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA), in addition to a nested PCR assay targeting HBV S gene. The mean age of the study group was 43.2 (range between 27-65) years, 64.3% (18/28) of them were males and the mean duration of HIV infection was 4.2 (2-11) years. Mean CD4+ ve CD8+ T-cell counts were 414 ¬± 267 cells/mm3 and 854 ¬± 293 cells/mm3, respectively. Twenty-six (92.8%) cases were under highly-active anti-retroviral therapy at the time of the study, 88.5% of which included HBV-active drugs (lamivudine or tenofovir). HIV RNA were found negative in 11 (39.3%) patients, of those nine (81.8%) were the cases who treated with HBV-active antiretroviral therapy. HBsAg were negative in all of the 28 patients, while the positivity rates of anti-HBs and anti-HCV were 39.3% (11/28) and 3.6% (1/28), respectively. All samples were negative for HBV DNA via the commercial real-time PCR and in-house nested PCR assays. The absence of occult HBV in the study group may indicate the absence of occult HBV or suppression of viral replication due to the anti-retroviral therapy. In conclusion, further large-scale studies are required to fully understand the impact of occult HBV in HIV-infected patients in Turkey."
283,0.01,2.0000,"To study the relation between general cellular immunity and the course of hepatitis B within a group of chronic hemodialysis patients, T-lymphocyte number and function were investigated in 13 persistently hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg)-positive patients, in 32 HBSAg-negative patients, and in 11 patients who had recovered from hepatitis B and compared with that of 21 age-matched controls. Phytohemagglutinin-induced lymphocyte stimulation in vitro and the number of circulating T-cells in the HBSAg-positive group were significantly decreased as compared with those of the recovered group and the controls. Lymphocyte stimulation by pokeweed mitogen and by an antigen cocktail showed the same tendency, but no significant differences between the HBSAg-positive and the recovered groups. Uremic sera from the three patient groups had similar depressive effects on phytohemagglutinin induced lymphocyte stimulation of controls. Serum immunoglobulin G, (IgG), IgA, and IgM were normal in the three patient groups. It is concluded that chronic hemodialysis patients, who have become persistent HBSAg-carriers, have a significantly decreased T-lymphocyte number and function as compared with hemodialysis patients who are able to eliminat hepatitis B virus (HBV). The difference could not be ascribed to the HBV infection itself. This indicates that T-cells play an important role in the elimination of HBV in hemodialysis patients."
4394,0.01,2.0000,"Serological detection of isolated anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) can occur in various scenarios, but the most clinically relevant situation is occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical relevance of isolated anti-HBc and of OBI with isolated anti-HBc from an unselected hospital population. A total of 14,253 patients referred for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)/anti-HBs testing were classified into either the Health Promotion Center (HPC) group or the patient group. For patients who were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, an anti-HBc test was additionally performed. An HBV DNA real-time PCR test was performed on isolated anti-HBc patients, and their demographic and clinical data were reviewed. The measured prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and OBI in isolated anti-HBc patients was 5.9 % and 4.7 %, respectively. Prevalence was higher in males, elderly people, and the patient group than in females, the younger, and the HPC group, respectively. In most cases, the levels of HBV DNA load were very low (less than 200 IU/mL), and most cases of OBI presented without liver disease or history of HBV infection. The prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and OBI are affected by the methods of detection, subject population, and constituent factors such as sex and age. Although detection of HBV DNA does not always indicate infectivity, highly sensitive standardized HBV DNA tests are needed in clinical settings to exclude the possibility of OBI, especially in the advanced age group."
4489,0.01,2.0000,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with a high incidence of lymphoma. Typically, the lymphomas are B-cell in origin, and although they occur in the setting of HIV-1 infection, historical studies have found no evidence for the presence of HIV-1 within the transformed B-cells. We describe a new class of large cell lymphoma wherein HIV p24 expression within the tumor specimens was found to be extremely high. In the first case, HIV was expressed in the tumor-associated transformed T-cells. In three other cases, HIV was found to be highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages. These tumors exhibited a mixed immunophenotype histologically. Analysis by inverse polymerase chain reaction, using HIV long terminal repeat primers, demonstrated monoclonal HIV integration sites for all four tumors. Direct sequencing of the T-cell lymphoma inverse polymerase chain reaction products identified the HIV integration site within the fur gene, just upstream from the c-fes/fps protooncogene. Using segments of the fur gene as a probe, the other three monoclonal integration sites mapped to the same region. Although the integration and up-regulation of c-fes/fps was localized to the tumor cells within the T-cell lymphoma, the cells containing the monoclonal HIV in the other mixed immunophenotype lymphomas are currently unknown. These observations suggest that HIV may contribute directly to lymphomagenesis and identify a common site of HIV integration within a subset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome lymphoma."
6241,0.01,2.0000,"The recent availability of CCR5 antagonists as anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) therapeutics has highlighted the need to accurately identify CXCR4-using variants in patient samples when use of this new drug class is considered. The Trofile assay (Monogram Biosciences) has become the method that is the most widely used to define tropism in the clinic prior to the use of a CCR5 antagonist. By comparison, the MT-2 assay has been used since early in the HIV epidemic to define tropism in clinical specimens. Given that there are few data from direct comparisons of these two assays, we evaluated the performance of the plasma-based Trofile assay and the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based MT-2 assay for the detection of CXCR4 use in defining the tropism of HIV isolates derived from clinical samples. The various samples used for this comparison were derived from participants of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV infection and AIDS who underwent consecutive MT-2 assay testing of their PBMCs at approximately 3-month intervals. This unique sample set was specifically selected because consecutive MT-2 assays had demonstrated a shift from negative to positive in PBMCs, reflecting the first emergence of CXCR4-using virus in PBMCs above the level of detection of the assay in these individuals. Trofile testing was performed with clonal HIV type 1 (HIV-1) variants (n = 21), MT-2 cell culture-derived cells (n = 20) and supernatants (n = 42), and plasma samples (n = 76). Among the clonal HIV-1 variants and MT-2 cell culture-derived samples, the results of the Trofile and MT-2 assays demonstrated a high degree of concordance (95% to 98%). Among consecutive plasma samples, detection of CXCR4-using virus was at or before the time of first detection by the MT-2 assay in 5/10 patients by the original Trofile assay and in 9/10 patients by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay. Differences in the time to the first detection of CXCR4 use between the MT-2 assay (PBMCs) and the original Trofile assay (plasma) were greatly reduced by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay, suggesting that sensitivity for the detection of minor CXCR4-using variants may be a more important determinant of discordant findings than compartmentalization. The similarities in performance of the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile and MT-2 assays suggest that either may be an appropriate methodology to define tropism in patient specimens."
3124,0.01,2.0000,"The Hepatitis C virus has emerged over the last two decades as the cause of the second greatest viral infection epidemic after the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A significant characteristic of the infection with the Hepatitis C virus is the variable course of its natural history. About 80% of the people who acquire this agent develop a chronic infection, with varying degree of liver damage, including cirrhosis and even hepatocelular carcinoma. However, only a minority progresses towards more severe forms. Several factors associated with the host seem to influence the progression of Hepatitis C into cirrhosis. The most important are alcohol abuse, the age in which the infection is acquired, duration of the infection, overweight, male sex and coinfection with Hepatitis A or B or HIV. Evidence of the role of iron levels in the liver, tobacco or the source of infection are less clear. The factors associated with the agent do not seem to play any role in the progression of the disease. Additional studies with adequate control groups are required to confirm the participation of the above mentioned host factors and to identify others which could influence the natural history of the Hepatitis C infection. A reduction in the ingestion of alcohol, overweight and tobacco consumption could contribute to the treatment of HVC chronic infection, as well as vaccination against Hepatitis A and B."
355,0.01,2.0000,"HIV increases the risk of liver disease as do two common coinfections, hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV). However, whether combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) reverses or exacerbates hepatic fibrosis remains unclear.This was an observational retrospective study. cART-na√Øve HIV-infected subjects without a history of substance abuse (including alcohol) had liver disease stage determined by aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio indices (APRIs) and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) before and 24 and 48 weeks after cART. All the data were retrieved from previously established cohorts. Values before and after cART were compared using Wilcoxon test for paired samples. Regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with moderate-to-severe liver disease.Of the 1105 HIV-infected subjects, 120 were HBV coinfected and 64 were HCV coinfected. About 20% of HIV monoinfected participants had APRI and FIB-4 scores consistent with moderate-to-significant fibrosis compared to ‚àº36% of HIV-HBV coinfected and 67% to 77% of HIV-HCV coinfected participants. In adjusted analyses compared with HIV monoinfection, HBV coinfection was associated with 1.18-fold higher APRI (P‚Ää<‚Ää0.001) and a 1.12-fold higher FIB-4 (P‚Ää=‚Ää0.007) prior to cART; while HCV coinfection was associated with 1.94-fold higher APRI (P‚Ää<‚Ää0.001) and a 1.43-fold higher FIB-4 (P‚Ää<‚Ää0.001). After 48 weeks of cART, both fibrosis scores decreased in all subjects; however, HCV coinfection was still associated with higher fibrosis scores at week 48 compared to HIV monoinfection.cART was associated with improvement in hepatic fibrosis scores in the majority of HIV-hepatitis coinfected and HIV-monoinfected Chinese participants."
9394,0.01,2.0000,"Taken as prescribed, that is, with high adherence, combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has changed HIV infection and disease from being a sure predictor of death to a manageable chronic illness. Adherence, however, is difficult to achieve and maintain. The CAPRISA 058 study was conducted between 2007 and 2009 to test the efficacy of individualized motivational counselling to enhance ART adherence in South Africa. As part of the overall trial, a qualitative sub-study was conducted, including 30 individual interviews and four focus group discussions with patients in the first 9 months of ART initiation. Data were inductively analyzed, using thematic analysis, to identify themes central to ART adherence in this context. Four themes emerged that characterize the participants' experiences and high motivation to adhere to ART. Participants in this study were highly motivated to adhere, as they acknowledged that ART was 'life-giving', in the face of a large amount of morbidity and mortality. They were further supported by techniques of routine remembering, and highlighted the importance of good social support and access to supportive healthcare workers, to their continued success in negotiating their treatment. Participants in the current study told us that their adherence motivation is enhanced by free accessible care, approachable and supportive healthcare workers, broad social acceptance of ART, and past first-hand experiences with AIDS-related co-morbidity and mortality. Programs that include specific attention to these aspects of care will likely be successful in the long term."
540,0.01,2.0000,"Puerto Rico has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS seen for any US state or territory, and antiretroviral therapy has been a mainstay of efforts to mitigate the HIV/AIDS public health burden on the island. We studied the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 mutation and antiretroviral drug resistance in Puerto Rico by monitoring the population frequency of resistance-associated mutations from 2002 to 2011. Whole blood samples from 4,475 patients were analyzed using the TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit and OpenGene DNA Sequencing System in the Immunoretrovirus Research Laboratory at Universidad Central del Caribe. Results show that 64.0% of female and 62.9% of male patients had HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to at least one antiretroviral medication. L63P and M184V were the dominant mutations observed for the protease (PRO) and reverse transcriptase (RT) encoding genes, respectively. Specific resistance mutations, along with their associated drug resistance profiles, can be seen to form temporal clusters that reveal a steadily changing landscape of resistance trends over time. Both women and men showed resistance mutations for an average of 4.8 drugs over the 10-year period, further underscoring the strong selective pressure exerted by antiretrovirals along with the rapid adaptive response of HIV. Nevertheless, both female and male patients showed a precipitous decrease for overall drug resistance, and for PRO mutations in particular, over the entire course of the study, with the most rapid decrease in frequency seen after 2006. The reduced HIV-1 mutation and drug resistance trends that we observed are consistent with previous reports from multi-year studies conducted around the world. Reduced resistance can be attributed to the use of more efficacious antiretroviral drug therapy, including the introduction of multi-drug combination therapies, which limited the ability of the virus to mount rapid adaptive responses to antiretroviral selection pressure."
9884,0.01,2.0000,"The prevalence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among incarcerated individuals in the United States is estimated to be between 12% and 31%. HCV treatment during incarceration is an attractive option because of improved access to health care and directly observed therapy. We compared incarcerated and nonincarcerated HCV-infected patients evaluated for treatment at a single academic center between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2007. During this period, 521 nonincarcerated and 388 incarcerated patients were evaluated for HCV treatment. Three hundred and nineteen (61.2%) nonincarcerated patients and 234 (60.3%) incarcerated patients underwent treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Incarcerated patients were more likely to be male, African-American race, and have a history of alcohol or intravenous drug use. Treated incarcerated patients were less likely to have genotype 1 virus and were less likely to have undergone previous treatment. There was a similar prevalence of coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in both groups. A sustained viral response (SVR) was achieved in 97 (42.9%) incarcerated patients, compared to 115 (38.0%) nonincarcerated patients (P = 0.304). Both groups had a similar proportion of patients that completed a full treatment course. Stepwise logistic regression was conducted, and the final model included full treatment course, non-genotype 1 virus, younger age at treatment start, and negative HIV status. Incarceration status was not a significant predictor when added to this model (P = 0.075)."

Medicaid pharmacy claims data were used for analyses. To examine the association between treatment group and medication adherence, three types of multivariate regressions were employed. In addition, all regressions were conducted for the whole population using data from 1995 to 2001 as well as a subpopulation, which excluded data prior to September 1997. Model covariates included patient characteristics, healthcare utilization, and non-study antiretroviral therapy use. The likelihood of > or =95% adherence among patients on combination therapy was three times greater than patients taking 3TC and ZDV in separate pills. Also, combination therapy patients had on average 1.4 fewer adherence failures per year of follow-up and nearly double the time to adherence failure compared to the separate pills group. Consistency among study results suggests that fixed dose combination therapies such as lamivudine (3TC) 150 mg/ zidovudine (ZDV) 300 mg should be considered when prescribing HIV treatment that includes an appropriate dual nucleoside."

The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with TDR mutations defined according to the list of the World Health Organization was investigated among 53 therapy-na√Øve persons with confirmed recent HIV-1 infection diagnosed in Poland, in the years 2008-2010. Proviral DNA was amplified, sequenced, and screened for the TDR mutations in the pol gene fragments coding for the whole protease and the initial 256 residues of the reverse transcriptase. The frequency of sequences with at least one TDR mutation was 11.3%. In four (7.5%) sequences at least one resistance mutation related to reverse transcriptase inhibitors was identified, and in further two (3.8%) sequences one mutation related to protease inhibitors' resistance was present. The moderate rate of TDR highlights the need for a continuous surveillance and resistance testing among treatment-na√Øve individuals to optimize treatment effects within a country. "
8709,0.01,2.0000,"The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with HIV infection among specific population subgroups and complement the HIV surveillance system in Cameroon. Five subgroups (truck drivers, female-sex-workers, university students, health service providers, and residents along Chad-Cameroon petroleum pipeline) were targeted in 2004. Potential participants were approached at their geographically diverse areas and consented to participate in the study. Anonymous blood samples were collected. 4,011 participants were surveyed (35% students, 25% sex-workers, 20% pipeline residents, 12.5% health service providers, 7.5% truck drivers). HIV prevalence was highest among sex-workers [26.4%, (95% CI, 23.6-29.2)], pipeline residents [19.9% (95% CI, 17.1-22.7)] and truck drivers [16.3% (95% CI, 12.3-20.9)] and lowest among health service providers [5.2% (95% CI, 3.4-7.5)] and university students [3.8% (95% CI, 2.9-5.0)]. Risky sexual behaviours were practiced in all subpopulations. Multivariable analysis shows in female-sex-workers that; older age, residing in the grassland region (Northwest and West Provinces) and inconstant condom use were significantly associated with HIV infection. Despite a moderate HIV prevalence in the general Cameroonian population, some subgroups are at much higher risk for HIV transmission and practicing risky sexual behaviours. There is need for expanded prevention and care programs with emphasis on truck drivers, sex-workers and pipeline residents."
1190,0.01,2.0000,"Physical activity (PA) can improve cardiorespiratory status, strength, body composition and quality of life for patients infected with HIV. Evidence from HIV-uninfected populations also shows that PA is associated with a lower risk of mortality, primarily death due to cardiovascular causes. There is, however, a lack of data on how physically active HIV-infected patients are. In this study, we assessed levels of self-reported PA over time in patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, a large multicentre prospective observational cohort study. We included a total of 10,540 patients who completed at least one report of PA between December 2009 and November 2014 during routine clinical follow-up (scheduled every 6 months). In the first year after December 2009 there was a higher rate of non-response so these data are of a lesser reliability. Over the next four years, the percentage of patients reporting no free-time PA at all declined from 49% to 44%. In contrast, in two ""Sport Switzerland"" surveys of the general population in 2008 and 2014, the percentage of individuals reporting no sports activities at all was considerably lower and relatively stable over time (27% in 2008; 26% in 2014). In our analysis, the percentage of patients reporting sedentary activity at work increased from 23% to 26% over the four years. Subgroup findings suggest differences between women and men and between patients classified by their age, stage of infection and CD4 cell count. Integrating PA counselling into the routine care of HIV-infected patients and promoting PA among this population has the potential to improve the general state of health and quality of life for HIV-infected patients and reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease."
8635,0.01,2.0000,"Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common in resource-limited settings but is frequently not diagnosed. The authors retrospectively tested specimens for HBV in HIV-infected Thai women who had participated in an antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinical study. A substantial proportion (27 of 211; 13%) of HIV-infected women were HBV coinfected. Among HIV/HBV-coinfected women, the authors observed similar rates of antiretroviral-associated liver toxicity (despite nevirapine [NVP] use) and CD4 count reconstitution as observed in HIV-monoinfected women. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening detected the majority (81%) of HBV coinfections, including all 5 HBV-coinfected women who did not suppress HBV despite 48 weeks of lamivudine (3TC)-containing ART and could be used to tailor ART for patients diagnosed with HBV coinfection in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Although HBsAg screening did not diagnose 5 occult HBV coinfections, these women achieved HBV suppression on 3TC-containing ART, suggesting that not detecting occult HBV coinfection would have limited clinical impact.

2509,0.01,2.0000,"CD8+ T lymphocytes of HIV-1-infected individuals can efficiently suppress HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T lymphocytes. To elucidate the molecular events underlying this suppression, we have used the HIV-1 LTR directing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT) in transient transfection assays using human Jurkat T cells. In addition to supernatants of patient CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD4+ > 350/microliters), supernatant of a T cell clone derived by Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-mediated transformation of CD8+ T lymphocytes of a patient demonstrating inhibition of virus replication were examined. Similar levels of inhibition of LTR-mediated gene expression in response to Tat or mitogenic activation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore were observed by supernatants of both sources. The inhibitory effect of CD8+ T lymphocytes was not exclusive to lentiviral LTRs since transcription of both the HTLV-I LTR and RSV LTR in response to mitogen was effectively inhibited. In examination of the influence of CD8+ T cell-derived supernatant on NF kappa B-mediated activation, a dimer of the HIV-1 NF kappa B elements directing CAT was markedly inhibited by supernatants of both patient CD8+ lymphocytes and the HVS-derived CD8+ clone. Thus the inhibitory nature of CD8+ T lymphocytes appears not to be specific to lentiviral promoters and may mediate an inhibitory effect via the NF kappa B element."
3644,0.01,2.0000,"Integration of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome into the host chromosome is a vital step in the HIV life cycle. The highly conserved cytosine-adenine (CA) dinucleotide sequence immediately upstream of the cleavage site is crucial for integrase (IN) activity. As this viral enzyme has an important role early in the HIV-1 replication cycle, interference with the IN substrate has become an attractive strategy for therapeutic intervention. We demonstrated that a designed zinc finger protein (ZFP) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) targets the 2-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) circle junctions of HIV-1 DNA with nanomolar affinity. We report now that 2LTRZFP-GFP stably transduced into 293T cells interfered with the expression of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped lentiviral red fluorescent protein (RFP), as shown by the suppression of RFP expression. We also used a third-generation lentiviral vector and pCEP4 expression vector to deliver the 2LTRZFP-GFP transgene into human T-lymphocytic cells, and a stable cell line for long-term expression studies was selected for HIV-1 challenge. HIV-1 integration and replication were inhibited as measured by Alu-gag real-time PCR and p24 antigen assay. In addition, the molecular activity of 2LTRZFP-GFP was evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The results were confirmed by Alu-gag real-time PCR for integration interference. We suggest that the expression of 2LTRZFP-GFP limited viral integration on intracellular immunization, and that it has potential for use in HIV gene therapy in the future."
4293,0.01,2.0000,"In order to evaluate the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the etiology of chronic liver diseases, paired sera of 143 patients with biopsy-documented chronic hepatitis were tested for HBsAg and anti-HBs by radioimmunoassay method. HBsAg was detected in 67.3% of patients with a preceding verified eipsode of acute hepatitis, and in 26.7% of patients with a cryptogenic form of chronic hepatitis. HBsAg was not found in any of patients with alcoholic chronic hepatitis and in only two of 18 patients with other forms of chronic liver disease. No significant difference in the incidence of anti-HBs was observed in all groups of patients. According to previous studies our results confirm the higher prevalence of HBV infection in etiology of chronic persistent and aggressive hepatitis and indicate that this prevalence may be observed especially in Middle and South Italy. The presence of HBsAg in the serum of 37.2% of our patients with cirrhosis compared with 9% of reported cases in North Italy suggest that HBV plays an important role in the etiology of cirrhosis of the liver in our area."
1387,0.01,2.0000,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lymphocyte P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and genotype in vivo and the expression of lymphocyte receptors critical in the life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), i.e., CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4. Using flow cytometry to quantify each membrane receptor/transporter, we demonstrate a highly significant correlation between P-gp protein expression and the expression of CXCR4 (rho = 0.874; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, confocal microscopy showed colocalized expression of CXCR4 and P-gp in the lymphocyte membrane. This significant relationship was also apparent at the mRNA level by use of reverse transcription-PCR (rho = 0.61; P < 0.005) and was present in both phytohemagglutinin-stimulated and unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Genotypic analysis of the C3435T single-nucleotide polymorphism of P-gp confirmed significantly higher levels of P-gp in C (range, 2.45 to 11.00 relative fluorescence units [RFU])- than in T (range, 0.25 to 5.00 RFU)-homozygous individuals (P = 0.0088; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.7 to 6.3 RFU). An equivalent association between CXCR4 levels and C (range, 12.7 to 44.1 RFU) versus T (range, 3 to 18.9 RFU) genotype was also demonstrated (P = 0.0019; 95% CI, 5.4 to 23.7). Functionally, although these correlates had no impact on HIV-1 production from either X4- or R5-tropic virus, expression correlated significantly with the activity of the HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) saquinavir for both P-gp (rho = 0.75; P = 0.0019) and CXCR4 (rho = 0.71; P = 0.0041). This study defines an association between P-gp (expression and genotype) and CXCR4 that may have implications for the selection of viral tropism and the access of drugs to protease for specific tropic types. The interplay between these two proteins may also influence the viral genotypes which escape effective chemotherapy and which therefore have the opportunity to evolve resistance to PIs."
5787,0.01,2.0000,"HIV subtype-specific data on mutation type, rate, and accumulation following HAART treatment failure are limited. We studied patterns and accrual of drug resistance mutations in a Cambodian CRF01_AE-infected cohort continuing a virologically failing first-line, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor- (NNRTI-) based, HAART. Between 2005 and 2007, 837 adult HIV-infected patients had regular plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load measurements at Sihanouk Hospital Centre of Hope (SHCH), Cambodia. Drug resistance testing was performed in all patients with HIV-1 RNA >1000 copies/ml after at least 6 months of HAART. Seventy-one patients with a mean age of 34 years, of whom 68% were male, were retrospectively assessed at virological failure. The median duration of antiretroviral therapy was 12.3 (IQR 7.1-18.23) months, the median CD4 cell count was 173 (IQR 118-256) cells/mm(3), and the mean plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 3.9 log (SD 0.72) at failure. NNRTI mutations, M184I/V mutation, thymidine analogue mutations, and K65R were observed in 78.9%, 69%, 20%, and 12.7% of patients, respectively. For 33 patients, genotypic testing was carried out on at least two occasions before the switch to second-line HAART after a median duration of 5.8 (IQR 4.3-6.1) months of virological failure: 54.5% of patients accumulated new mutations with a rate of 1.6 mutations per person-year. Accumulation was seen both for nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and also in patients with low-level viremia. Subtype-specific data on mutation type, rate, and accumulation after HAART failure are urgently needed to optimize treatment strategies in resource-limited settings."
4864,0.01,2.0000,"HIV transmitted drug resistance (TDR) can compromise antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited countries like China where ART has been scaled up and thus leads to an important public health concern. The aim of the study was to elucidate the HIV-1 genetic characteristics and TDR in Hangzhou, China. Two-hundred eleven ART-naive, newly diagnosed individuals were enrolled during January and August 2013. Specimens were classified as recent or chronic infections using the BED capture enzyme immunoassay (BED-CEIA). The pol fragment covering the entire protease and the first 300 codons of the reverse transcriptase gene was amplified by RT-PCR and nested PCR. Genotypic drug resistance (DR) and phylogenetic analysis were performed on the 200 obtained sequences. Multiple genotypes were identified, including CRF01_AE (62.0%), CRF07_BC (31.0%), subtype B (2.0%), CRF08_BC (1.5%), CRF55_01B (1.0%), CRF18_cpx (0.5%), and unique recombinant forms (URFs, 2.0%). All the four URFs were found in men who have sex with men, consisting of a recombination of CRF01_AE with subtype B or CRF07_BC. The prevalence of primary DR in newly diagnosed individuals in Hangzhou was low (4.0%). The proportion of DR mutation to protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was 1.5%, 1.5%, and 1.0%, respectively. BED-CEIA revealed that 21.8% (45/211) of the specimens were associated with recent infections. The prevalence of TDR in recent infections was moderate (6.5%). High HIV diversity and relatively high prevalence of TDR in new infections has been found in Hangzhou, indicating an increasing challenge for future HIV prevention and treatment."
3529,0.01,2.0000,"Prior to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-infected patients were usually not considered as transplant candidates because of the poor prognosis of their underlying disease and concerns regarding the potential detrimental effects of immunosuppression on viral load and immune status. However, with the significant HAART-associated improvements in morbidity and mortality, good short-term outcomes after liver and kidney transplantation for patients with HIV infection have been reported. Nevertheless, HIV infection is currently considered a contraindication to lung transplantation in most transplant centers worldwide. The results of a double lung transplant performed in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and end-stage respiratory failure (ESRF) are presented after a 2-year follow-up. Approval of and recommendations for the management of this patient were obtained from the Italian National Center for Transplantation as an extension of the ongoing Italian protocol for liver and kidney transplantation in HIV-infected individuals. The operation was successful and the patient recovered rapidly after surgery. A cautious infectious and immunosuppressive management allowed so far the avoidance of major infectious complications and rejection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of lung transplantation in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient."
3726,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV-DNA) was studied by Southern blot analysis in liver biopsy specimens from 75 HBsAg-positive patients with chronic liver disease living in southern Italy. Twenty-seven of the patients were hepatitis delta virus (HDV) superinfected. Intrahepatic HBV-DNA was detected in 54 (72%) patients, 32 (59%) of them with replicative forms. The presence of replicative forms was directly related to liver HBcAg and inversely related to liver HDAg, as shown by multivariate analysis. However, 14 patients with intrahepatic HBV-DNA non-replicative pattern and about half of HDV-infected patients were liver HBcAg and/or serum HBV-DNA positive, mostly in low amounts. Histological inflammatory activity was strongly related to liver HBcAg expression regardless of HDV superinfection, as confirmed by multivariate analysis. Our results confirm previous studies about the concordance between intrahepatic HBV-DNA replicative pattern and liver HBcAg expression and about inhibition by HDV of high-level HBV replication. However, they suggest that low-level HBV replication may have an important role in causing liver damage also among HDV-infected patients, in a population where the spreading of HBV and HDV is a naturally occurring event."
8094,0.01,2.0000,"There is a high prevalence of substance abuse and psychiatric disorders among HIV-infected individuals. Importantly, drug and alcohol-use disorders are frequently co-morbid with depression, anxiety and severe mental illness. Not only do these disorders increase the risk of contracting HIV, they have also been associated with decreased highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) utilisation, adherence and virological suppression. The literature evaluating the relationship between substance abuse and HIV outcomes has primarily focused on injection drug users, although there has been increasing interest in alcohol, cocaine and marijuana. Similarly, the mental health literature has focused largely on depression, with a lesser focus on severe mental illness or anxiety. To date, there is little literature evaluating the association between co-occurring HIV, substance abuse and mental illness on HAART uptake, adherence and virological suppression. Adherence interventions in these populations have demonstrated mixed efficacy. Both directly observed therapy and pharmacist-assisted interventions appear promising, as do integrated behavioural interventions. However, the current intervention literature has several limitations: few of these studies are randomised, controlled trials; the sample sizes have generally been small; and co-occurring substance abuse and mental illness has not specifically been targeted in these studies. Future studies examining individual substances of abuse, psychiatric disorders and co-occurring substance abuse and psychiatric disorders on HIV outcomes will inform targeted adherence interventions."
5254,0.01,2.0000,"The mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of a man (VH) homozygous for the CCR5Delta32 mutation were investigated, and coreceptors other than CCR5 used by HIV type 1 (HIV-1) isolated from this individual were identified. In contrast to previous reports, this individual's rate of disease progression was not accelerated. Homozygosity for CCR5Delta32 mutation was demonstrated by PCR and DNA sequencing (R. Biti et al., Nat. Med. 3:252-253, 1997). CCR5 surface expression was absent on T lymphocytes and macrophages. HIV was isolated by coculture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from siblings who were homozygous (VM) or wild type (WT) for the CCR5Delta32 mutation. The virus demonstrated dual tropism for infection of MT2 cell line and primary macrophages. Sequencing of the full HIV genome directly from the patient's PBMCs revealed 21 nucleotide insertions in the V1 region of gp120. The VH envelope sequence segregated apart from both the T-cell-line-adapted tropic strains NL4-3 and SF2 and M-tropic strain JRFL or YU2 by phylogenetic tree analysis. VH was shown to utilize predominantly CXCR4 for entry into T lymphocytes and macrophages by HOS.CD4 cell infection assay, direct envelope protein fusion, and inhibition by anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (12G5), SDF-1, and AMD3100. Microsatellite mapping demonstrated the separate inheritance of CXCR4 by both homozygote brothers (VH and VM). Our study demonstrates the ability of certain strains of HIV to readily use CXCR4 for infection or entry into macrophages, which is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of late-stage disease and presumably also HIV transmission."
6125,0.01,2.0000,"Increased coronary heart disease risk in HIV-positive patients using antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been a controversial topic since 1998 when the dyslipidaemic effect of protease inhibitors (PIs) was recognised. Accumulating evidence suggests an association between ART and increased coronary heart disease risk. In 2003, the large, prospective D:A:D (Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs) study reported a 26% relative increase in the rate of myocardial infarction per year of exposure during the first 4-6 years of use. As the HIV-population grows older, infectious disease specialists have to consider unfamiliar areas of internal medicine such as lipid-lowering therapy and smoking cessation. Moreover, the ART regimen itself may be a modifiable risk factor, as there are both class differences and within-class differences in the tendency to increase lipids. Most nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), including the newer agents tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine, have little or no effect on lipid levels or glucose metabolism. One exception is the highly effective NRTI stavudine, which has a dyslipidaemic profile and a negative effect on glucose metabolism. In contrast the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine may increase the 'good cholesterol' high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and thus reduce the total cholesterol : HDL cholesterol index. Most of the PIs have some dyslipidaemic effect, especially ritonavir (alone or in combination with other PIs), fosamprenavir and the novel PI tipranavir. Only atazanavir, and to some extent saquinavir, seem to have little effect on lipid levels and glucose metabolism. Studies on blood pressure in HIV-positive patients have been contradictory. Apart from a recent report from the D:A:D study where lower blood pressure was found in patients receiving NNRTIs, the influence of the individual drugs on blood pressure is unknown. When hypertension is detected in a HIV-positive patient, creatinine clearance (CL(CR)) should be calculated and the urine checked for proteinuria. When CL(CR) is <30 mL/min, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended. Many hypertensive HIV-positive patients have proteinuria and an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist is a better choice than a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel antagonist in these patients. In addition, physicians treating patients with ART should be especially aware of the long list of possible interactions between PIs and anti-hypertensive- and lipid-lowering drugs. This review discusses important clinical aspects of treating middle-aged HIV-positive patients who have an increased risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event."

7090,0.01,2.0000,"Raltegravir, as the first HIV integrase inhibitor, has been used and prospectively monitored since 2010 in our HIV outpatient centre, where over 1,200 patients are monitored. The aim of our report is to perform an interim assessment of the background, the safety profile and the clinical-laboratory monitoring of all patients treated with a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including raltegravir, for at least 12 months. In all, 109 pretreated patients started a raltegravir-containing cART when aged 44.8 plus or minus 19.2 years, with a history of HIV infection lasting 13.4 plus or minus 9.7 years. All subjects were monitored for at least 12 months (mean 17.2 plus or minus 10.3 months). In the vast majority of cases (93 of 109: 85.3%), multiple (3-16) prior cART changes prompted raltegravir introduction in advanced-salvage lines: 72 of 109 (66.1%) patients had even developed a concurrent triple-class resistance to anti-HIV compounds. The most frequent companion antiretroviral agents were: darunavir/ritonavir (75 cases), maraviroc (47 subjects), and etravirine (38 cases). The most common underlying conditions were: AIDS (46 patients), liver cirrhosis (31 cases), AIDS-related or other malignancies (23 cases), and major cardio-cerebro-vascular events (18 cases). A chronic HCV and HBV hepatitis were of concern in 48 and 23 patients, respectively. The adjunct of raltegravir favourably affected all clinical-laboratory markers of HIV disease progression, and those of the broad spectrum of comorbidities, except for two patients who failed the raltegravir-containing cART due to insufficient adherence. Despite the already compromised clinical situation, a minority of subjects experienced mild-transient clinical-laboratory untoward events possibly attributable to raltegravir, such that no patients discontinued raltegravir during the observation period. Only three AIDS-defining conditions became apparent during raltegravir-based cART; chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy cycles were performed as scheduled in patients suffering from cancer; chronic hepatitis B and C progressed to liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocarcinoma in only 2 and 6 patients. Otherwise, treatment with pegylated interferon-ribavirin became feasible in 25 patients of 48 with chronic HCV. During raltegravir-containing cART, neither autoimmune disorders nor novel malignancies were diagnosed. Only mild-transient gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue, dizziness, insomnia and cutaneous rash were reported, although their relationship with the study drug was difficult to assess due to multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. Abnormal liver function testings were observed in 57 patients (52.3%), all suffering from concurrent hepato-biliary disorders. Significant increases in serum lipids and/or lipase levels versus baseline values were never registered: serum lipid levels significantly improved after raltegravir introduction. Our experience with raltegravir underlines its excellent efficacy and safety profile, which exploits a novel mechanism of action, and displays no cross-resistance with any other antiretroviral. A progressively extended prescription in naive patients and early cART lines will allow the therapeutic potential of raltegravir to be exploited. "
334,0.01,2.0000,"In spite of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination, HBV infection remains an important public health problem worldwide. Although the HBV genotype distribution has been determined in some parts of South Central Asia, no survey has been conducted to determine the HBV genotype in Afghanistan. Twelve Afghan patients infected with HBV living in Afghanistan were enrolled in this study. Partial HBsAg and basic core promoter, precore, and core (BCP/preC/C) regions were amplified and subjected for direct sequencing. In parallel, precore G1896A mutation was also determined by an amplification-created restriction site method. Results revealed HBV genotype D (95% bootstrap value), sub-genotype D1 (98% bootstrap value), and subtype ayw2 in all Afghan isolates. Afghan isolates clustered in a separate branch in the D1 sub-genotype called D1', while supported by 82% bootstrap value. The percentage of intra-genotypic distance among Afghan isolates was 1.05% and inter-genotypic distance with the other genotype D was 2.87% and with other genotypes was 7.50%-11.1%. The wild-type, mixed infection, and precore mutant were found in six, two, and four HBV isolates, respectively. The A1762T/G1764A BCP dual mutation was found in one isolate. Three isolates presented single mutation in the BCP dual mutation region, whereas two showed a novel G1764T mutation. In conclusion, this preliminary study revealed HBV genotype D, sub-genotype D1, and subtype ayw2 of HBV among hepatitis B infected patients from Afghanistan. Further investigation should be carried out."
1372,0.01,2.0000,"Acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been increasing through promiscuous sexual contacts, and HBV genotype A (HBV/A) is frequent in patients with acute hepatitis B (AHB) in Japan. To compare the geographic distribution of HBV genotypes in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in Japan between 2005 and 2006 and between 2000 and 2001, with special attention to changes in the proportion of HBV/A, a cohort study was performed to survey changes in genotypes of CHB patients at 16 hospitals throughout Japan. Furthermore, we investigated the clinical characteristics of each genotype and examined the genomic characteristics of HBV/A isolates by molecular evolutionary analyses. Of the 1,271 patients, 3.5%, 14.1%, and 82.3% were infected with HBV/A, -B, and -C, respectively. In comparison with our previous survey during 2000 and 2001, HBV/A was twice as frequent (3.5% versus 1.7%; P = 0.02). The mean age was lower in the patients with HBV/A than in those with HBV/B or -C. Based on phylogenetic analyses of 11 full-length genomes and 29 pre-S2/S region sequences from patients, HBV/A isolates were imported from Europe and the United States, as well as the Philippines and India. They clustered with HBV/A from AHB patients and have spread throughout Japan. HBV/A has been increasing in CHB patients in Japan as a consequence of AHB spreading in the younger generation through promiscuous sexual contacts, aided by a tendency of HBV/A to induce chronic hepatitis. The spread of HBV/A infection in Japan should be prevented by universal vaccination programs."
2526,0.01,2.0000,"Defective hepatitis B virus DNA (dDNA) is reverse-transcribed from spliced hepatitis B virus (HBV) pregenomic messenger RNA (pgRNA) and has been identified in patients with chronic HBV (CH-B). The major 2.2-kb spliced pgRNA encodes a novel HBV gene product, the hepatitis B splice protein (HBSP) via a deletion and frame shift within the polymerase. Although spliced RNA and HBSP expression have been associated with increased HBV DNA levels and liver fibrosis, the role of dDNA in HBV-associated disease is largely undefined. Our aims were to (1) compare the relative proportions of dDNA (% dDNA) in a range of HBV-infected serum samples, including patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV coinfection and HBV-monoinfected persons with differing severities of liver disease, and (2) determine the effect of mutations associated with drug resistance on defective DNA production. Defective DNA was detected in 90% of persons with CH-B. There was no significant difference in the relative abundance of dDNA between the monoinfected and HIV/HBV-coinfected groups. We also found no association between the % dDNA and alanine aminotransferase, hepatitis B e antigen status, HBV DNA levels, fibrosis levels, compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis, genotype, or drug treatment. However, the % dDNA was significantly lower in individuals infected with lamivudine-resistant (LMV-R) HBV compared with wild-type HBV (P < 0.0001), indicating that antiviral drug resistance alters the balance between defective and genomic length DNA in circulation. Experiments in vitro using HBV encoding LMV-R mutations confirmed these results."
9053,0.01,2.0000,"The impact of antiretroviral drug exposure and associated lipodystrophy and/or insulin resistance (IR) on advanced liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is not fully documented. We determined the prevalence of advanced liver fibrosis (defined by hepatic stiffness ‚â•9.5‚ÄÉkPa) and associated factors, focusing on the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy and its major adverse effects (lipodystrophy and IR), in 671 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients included in the ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort. One hundred ninety patients (28.3%) had advanced liver fibrosis. In univariate analysis, advanced liver fibrosis was significantly associated with male sex, higher body mass index, HCV infection through intravenous drug use, a lower absolute CD4 cell count, a longer history of antiretroviral treatment, longer durations of protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and NRTI exposure, lipodystrophy, diabetes, and a high homeostasis model assessment method (HOMA) value. The only antiretroviral drugs associated with advanced liver fibrosis were efavirenz, stavudine and didanosine. In multivariate analysis, male sex (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.5; P‚ÄÉ=‚ÄÉ0.018), HCV infection through intravenous drug use (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6; P‚ÄÉ=‚ÄÉ0.018), lipodystrophy (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.3; P‚ÄÉ= 0.01), median didanosine exposure longer than 5‚ÄÉmonths (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.8; P‚ÄÉ=‚ÄÉ0.04) and a high HOMA value (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2; P‚ÄÉ=‚ÄÉ0.005) remained significantly associated with advanced liver fibrosis. Mitochondrial toxicity and IR thus appear to play a key role in liver damage associated with HIV/HCV-coinfection, and this should be taken into account when selecting and optimizing antiretroviral therapy. Antiretroviral drugs with strong mitochondrial toxicity (e.g. didanosine) or a major effect on glucose metabolism should be avoided."
9205,0.01,2.0000,"This paper examines factors associated with adherence to antiretroviral medications (ARVs) in an HIV-infected population at high risk for non-adherence: individuals living with psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. Data were examined from baseline interviews of a multisite cohort intervention study of 1138 HIV-infected adults with both a psychiatric and substance abuse disorder (based on a structured psychiatric research interview using DSM-IV criteria). The baseline interview documented mental illness and substance use in the past year, mental illness and substance abuse severity, demographics, service utilization in the past three months, general health and HIV-related conditions, self-reported spirituality and self-reported ARV medication use. Among the participants, 62% were prescribed ARVs at baseline (n = 542) and 45% of those on ARVs reported skipping medications in the past three days. Reports of non-adherence were significantly associated with having a detectable viral load (p<.01). The factors associated with non-adherence were current drug and alcohol abuse, increased psychological distress, less attendance at medical appointments, non-adherence to psychiatric medications and lower self-reported spirituality. Increased psychological distress was significantly associated with non-adherence, independent of substance abuse (p<.05). The data suggest that both mental illness and substance use must be addressed in HIV-infected adults living with these co-morbid illnesses to improve adherence to ARVs."

Contact with blood was confirmed as a risk factor for Hepatitis B infection; disposable needle-wash was also identified as a major risk factor. The personnel of the Sterilization Room is also in high risk for the infection. The nurse-aid personnel was also identified as a high risk group. We suggest that the needle wash is a risk factor very easy to remove, and also stopping the rotation of the auxiliary personnel could reduce the incidence of the infection in the personnel at risk."
555,0.01,2.0000,"The KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa is experiencing an explosive outbreak of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C infections. Understanding the genetic diversity of C viruses and the biological consequences of this diversity is important for the design of effective control strategies. We analyzed the protease gene, the first 935 nucleotides of reverse transcriptase, and the C2V5 envelope region of a representative set of 72 treatment-na√Øve patients from KwaZulu-Natal and correlated the results with amino acid signature and resistance patterns. Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple clusters or ""lineages"" of HIV-1 subtype C that segregated with other C viruses from southern Africa. The same pattern was observed for both black and Indian subgroups and for retrospective specimens collected prior to 1990, indicating that multiple sublineages of HIV-1 C have been present in KwaZulu-Natal since the early stages of the epidemic. With the exception of three nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations, no primary resistance mutations were identified. Numerous accessory polymorphisms were present in the protease, but none were located at drug-binding or active sites of the enzyme. One frequent polymorphism, I93L, was located near the protease/reverse transcriptase cleavage site. In the envelope, disruption of the glycosylation motif at the beginning of V3 was associated with the presence of an extra protein kinase C phosphorylation site at codon 11. Many polymorphisms were embedded within cytotoxic T lymphocyte or overlapping cytotoxic T-lymphocyte/T-helper epitopes, as defined for subtype B. This work forms a baseline for future studies aimed at understanding the impact of genetic diversity on vaccine efficacy and on natural susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs."
5186,0.01,2.0000,"The presented study examined the incidence, risk factors and outcome of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia (NBP) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects. Forty-two cases of NBP were ascertained by a 5-yr prospective surveillance and were matched to 84 controls. NBP incidence was 10.8 per 10,000 hospital patient-days. In particular, the incidence of NBP was 13.9 per 10,000 patient-days in the period 1994-1996 and 5.6 per 10,000 patient-days in the period 1997-1998 (p=0.01). By using regression analysis, predictors for developing NBP were an increasing value of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score (p<0.01) and the presence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related central nervous system (CNS) diseases (p=0.01). The additional hospital stay attributable to NBP was 15 days. The attributable mortality rate was estimated to be 29%. Nosocomial bacterial pneumonia is more common in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection, high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score and central nervous system diseases. Although the incidence of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia, as well of other opportunistic infections, decreased considerably in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, it still represents an important cause of mortality."
5773,0.01,2.0000,"Candida dubliniensis is a recently described species of Candida associated with oral candidiasis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Nineteen oral isolates of C. dubliniensis recovered from 10 HIV-positive and 4 HIV-negative individuals and one vaginal isolate from an additional HIV-negative subject were assessed for fluconazole susceptibility by broth microdilution (BMD), hyphal elongation assessment, and Etest. The susceptibilities of these 20 isolates to itraconazole and amphotericin B and of 10 isolates to ketoconazole were also determined by BMD only. Sixteen of the C. dubliniensis isolates were susceptible to fluconazole (MIC range, 0.125 to 1.0 microgram ml-1), and four (recovered from two AIDS patients) were fluconazole resistant (MIC range, 8 to 32 micrograms ml-1). Fluconazole susceptibility data obtained by hyphal elongation assessment correlated well with results obtained by BMD, but the corresponding Etest MIC results were one to four times higher. All of the isolates tested were found to be sensitive to itraconazole, ketoconazole, and amphotericin B. Sequential exposure of two fluconazole-sensitive (MIC, 0.5 microgram ml-1) C. dubliniensis isolates to increasing concentrations of fluconazole in agar medium resulted in the recovery of derivatives which expressed a stable fluconazole-resistant phenotype (BMD-determined MIC range, 16 to 64 micrograms ml-1), even after a minimum of 10 consecutive subcultures on drug-free medium and following prolonged storage at -70 degrees C. The clonal relationship between the parental isolates and their respective fluconazole-resistant derivatives was confirmed by genomic DNA fingerprinting and karyotype analysis. The results of this study demonstrate that C. dubliniensis is inherently susceptible to commonly used antifungal drugs, that fluconazole resistance does occur in clinical isolates, and that stable fluconazole resistance can be readily induced in vitro following exposure to the drug."

The diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection was supported by detection of HCV RNA in the serum. Cryoglobulin screening was done in all patients and the presence of a monoclonal component was investigated when the cryocrit was higher than 1%. Patients with lymphoproliferative disorders were further investigated. Four patients had a B lymphoproliferative disorder, which represents a prevalence of 2.7% in this cohort of patients with hepatitis C virus infection. Mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC), with cryocrit higher than 1%, was found in 16 of 148 patients (11%). It was type III MC in 13 patients and type II MC in 3. All patients who developed a B lymphoproliferative disorder had mixed cryoglobulinemia, with a monoclonal component (type II MC) in two patients and without a monoclonal component (type III MC) in the other two. The incidence of B-lymphoproliferative disorders among this cohort of patients with hepatitis C virus infection seems to be significantly increased. However, the high frequency of asymptomatic, undiagnosed HCV infection among the apparently healthy general population may decrease the true significance of this association. Systematic screening of cryoglobulin production in patients with hepatitis C virus infection might clarify whether the risk of B lymphoproliferative disorders increases when type II or type III mixed cryoglobulinemia is present."

We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult men and women in a peri-urban community of Karachi (Jam Kandah). Households were selected through systematic sampling from within all villages in the study area. All available adults within each household were interviewed about potential HCV risk factors. A blood specimen was collected to test for anti-HCV antibodies by enzyme immunoassay. We used generalized estimating equations while accounting for correlation of responses within villages to identify the factors associated with HCV infection.

A very high prevalence of HCV was found in the study population. Among women, unsafe health care practices, while among men extramarital sex, shaving from a barber and hospitalizations were associated with HCV infection. Efforts are needed to improve the safety of medical procedures to reduce the transmission of HCV in Pakistan [Corrections made in Summary after initial online publication.]."
821,0.01,2.0000,"Recurring outbreaks of acute hepatitis have been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among Peruvian military personnel stationed in the Amazon Basin region of Peru. The role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection was investigated as the possible cause of acute hepatitis among 88 military patients stationed at four different jungle outposts during 1992-1993. Analysis of serum markers indicated that 95% (84/88) had evidence of acute HBV infection; 64% (54/84) were also infected with HDV. Genetic analysis of PCR-amplified HDV and HBV fragments showed exclusively HDV genotype III and HBV genotype F. Furthermore, HDV RNA sequences were similar among patients from the same outpost but different from those at other jungle locations. The data suggested focal sources of HDV infection in the jungle environment of the outposts and, further, confirmed the unique association of HDV genotype III with severe cases of human disease in northern South America."
4934,0.01,2.0000,"Recognition and diagnosis of acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the primary care setting presents an opportunity for patient education and health promotion. Symptoms of acute HIV infection are nonspecific (e.g., fever, malaise, myalgias, rash), making misdiagnosis common. Because a wide range of conditions may produce similar symptoms, the diagnosis of acute HIV infection involves a high index of suspicion, a thorough assessment of HIV exposure risk, and appropriate HIV-related laboratory tests. HIV RNA viral load testing is the most useful diagnostic test for acute HIV infection because HIV antibody testing results are generally negative or indeterminate during acute HIV infection. After the diagnosis of acute HIV infection is confirmed, physicians should discuss effective transmission risk reduction strategies with patients. The decision to initiate antiretroviral therapy should be guided by consultation with an HIV specialist."
5442,0.01,2.0000,"To determine the effect of active tuberculosis on survival and the incidence of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients, we performed a retrospective cohort study at four U.S. medical centers to compare the survival and incidence rate of opportunistic infections in 106 HIV-infected patients with active tuberculosis (cases) with that of 106 HIV-infected patients without tuberculosis (control subjects) but with a similar level of immunosuppression (measured by the absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count) as the cases. Cases and control subjects were similar with regard to age, sex, race, previous opportunistic infection, and use of antiretroviral therapy, but they were more likely than control subjects to have a history of intravenous drug use (49 versus 19%). The mean CD4+ counts were similar for cases and control subjects (154 versus 153 cells/microliters, respectively). The incidence rate of new AIDS-defining opportunistic infections in cases was 4.0 infections per 100 person-months compared with 2.8 infections per 100 person-months in control subjects for an incidence rate ratio (RR) of 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 0.94-2.11). Cases also had a shorter overall survival than did controls subjects (p = 0.001). Active tuberculosis was associated with an increased risk for death (odds ratio = 2.17), even when controlling for age, intravenous drug use, previous opportunistic infection, baseline CD4+ count, and antiretroviral therapy. Although active tuberculosis may be an independent marker of advanced immunosuppression in HIV-infected patients, it may also act as a cofactor to accelerate the clinical course of HIV infection."
7381,0.01,2.0000,"Coinfection of blood-borne hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-positive individuals frequently occurs in inmate population and peculiar viral strains and patterns of virological markers may be observed.Plasma from 69 HIV-1-positive inmates was obtained from 7 clinical centers connected with correctional centers in different towns in Italy. HIV, HBV, and HCV markers were tested by commercial assays. Virus genotyping was carried out by sequencing the protease and reverse transcriptase-encoding region (PR-RT region) for HIV and a region encompassing the NS5B gene for HCV and subsequent phylogenetic analysis.Twelve over 14 HIV-subtyped inmates were infected with HIV-1 subtype B strains. The 2 non-B strains belonged to subtype G and CRF02_AG, in an Italian and a Gambian patient, respectively. Variants carrying the K103N and Y181C resistance mutations to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) were found in 2 out of 9 patients naive for combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) (22.2%). Most HIV-positive patients (92.8%) showed evidence of past or present HBV and/or HCV infection. Prevalence of HBV and HCV was 81.2% for both viruses, whereas prevalence of HBV/HCV coinfection was 69.6%. A significantly higher presence of HCV infection was found in Italians [odds ratio (OR) 11.0; interval 1.7-80.9] and in drug users (OR 27.8; interval 4.9-186.0). HCV subtypes were determined in 42 HCV or HBV/HCV-coinfected individuals. HCV subtypes 1a, 3a, 4d, and 1b were found in 42.9%, 40.5%, 14.3%, and 2.4% of inmates, respectively. Low titers of HBV DNA in HBV DNA positive subjects precluded HBV subtyping.The high prevalence of HBV and HCV coinfections in HIV-infected inmates, as well as the heterogeneity of HIV and HCV subtypes suggest the need to adopt systematic controls in prisons to monitor both the burden and the genetic forms of blood-borne viral infections, in order to apply targeted therapeutic interventions."
1908,0.01,2.0000,"The goal of the study was to improve the methodology of HIV genotyping for analysis of HIV drug resistance and HIV clustering. Using the protocol of Gall et al. (A. Gall, B. Ferns, C. Morris, S. Watson, M. Cotten, M. Robinson, N. Berry, D. Pillay, and P. Kellam, J Clin Microbiol 50:3838-3844, 2012, doi:10.1128/JCM.01516-12), we developed a robust methodology for amplification of two large fragments of viral genome covering about 80% of the unique HIV-1 genome sequence. Importantly, this method can be applied to both viral RNA and proviral DNA amplification templates, allowing genotyping in HIV-infected subjects with suppressed viral loads (e.g., subjects on antiretroviral therapy [ART]). The two amplicons cover critical regions across the HIV-1 genome (including pol and env), allowing analysis of mutations associated with resistance to protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs]), integrase strand transfer inhibitors, and virus entry inhibitors. The two amplicons generated span 7,124 bp, providing substantial sequence length and numbers of informative sites for comprehensive phylogenic analysis and greater refinement of viral linkage analyses in HIV prevention studies. The long-range HIV genotyping from proviral DNA was successful in about 90% of 212 targeted blood specimens collected in a cohort where the majority of patients had suppressed viral loads, including 65% of patients with undetectable levels of HIV-1 RNA loads. The generated amplicons could be sequenced by different methods, such as population Sanger sequencing, single-genome sequencing, or next-generation ultradeep sequencing. The developed method is cost-effective-the cost of the long-range HIV genotyping is under $140 per subject (by Sanger sequencing)-and has the potential to enable the scale up of public health HIV prevention interventions.

149,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has infected an estimated 170 million people worldwide, most of whom are chronically infected (60% to 80%). In Italy, the estimate of anti-HCV antibody (Ab) prevalence, in the general population of Northern Italy, is 3.2%; in Central and Southern Italy, it is 8.4% to 22.4%. Highest prevalence of infection (70% to 90%) is found among intravenous drug users. Our purpose is to monitor HCV infection among drug users treated in a Drug Addiction Centre (Ser.T) in Naples and to gain a better understanding of that relationship with the abused substance(s). Epidemiological data are shown for viral coinfections. Finally, the authors investigate access to specific HCV therapy in an Italian Ser.T. The study analyzed a group of 1753 consecutive subjects treated from 1988 to 2008 in the O.U. Ser.T D.S.31 (Ges√π e Maria Hospital), ASL Napoli 1 Centre. HCV Abs were detected by enzyme immune assay method and confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay III method. During the entire period, we performed real-time polymerase chain reaction at random for 312 patients. The incidence (per year) of HCV infection showed a rapid spread decrease from 49.5% in 2003 to 14.5% in 2008. The overall prevalence of HCV was 48.1%. We tested 312 randomly selected patients for viral replication. Our study showed active viral replication in 201 (64.4%) patients as follows: 97 of 201 (31.1%) resulted infected by genotype (gt) 1; 3 of 201 (1.0%) gt 2; 84 of 201 (26.9%) gt 3; and 4 of 201 (1.3%) gt 4. Coinfection data showed that HCV Ab prevalence was 58.5% (48 of 82) in hepatitis B virus chronically infected patients. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfection resulted in 95.2% (80 of 84) HIV patients. The prevalence of HIV Abs in HCV-infected patients was 8.99% (80 of 889). Analysis of drug abuse showed high prevalence of opiate addicted, multiabusers, and with high-risk factors. Cocaine abuser prevalence was 14.4%, and incidence, during past 4 years of the study, rose to 42.6%. Alcohol abuser prevalence represented 5.8% of patients and incidence rose to 17.7% in final 4 years of the study. In those opiate addicted, HCV infection was 61.0% (805 of 1320). HCV infection in cocaine-addicted patients was 9.5% (24 of 253). In 78 delta-9-tetra-hydro-cannabinol addicted patients, 5.1% of tests were positive (4 of 78). In alcohol abusers, HCV infection was 9.8% (10 of 102). Access to HCV treatment in our cohort from 2000 to 2008 resulted low (15.4%). Enhancing the Ser.Ts efficiency can result in health and financial benefits."
3379,0.01,2.0000,"Antiretroviral treatment nonadherence is complex, implicating more than a patient's ability and motivation to be compliant. The bulk of the research to date focuses on individual level barriers with less emphasis on the many system level factors that potentially impact patients' adherence behaviors. This study examined the effects of system enabling factors in addition to the frequently studied individual predisposing and enabling factors upon nonadherence to treatment. One hundred eighty-two patients from five community-based clinics were interviewed and their medical charts examined. Patients' self-reported nonadherence was correlated with clinicians' assessments of medication and appointment nonadherence. Seven individual predisposing factors (gender, ethnicity, birthplace, years of education, HIV Overview of Problems-Evaluation System [HOPES] psychosocial, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] anxiety, and HADS depression scores) were found to be significantly associated with treatment adherence/nonadherence. Individual enabling factors (hopefulness and access to health care), as well as treatment by clinic staff, a system enabling factor, were significantly associated with adherence/nonadherence. In a multivariate analysis, six factors - age (younger), gender (female), birth outside the United States, level of hopefulness (lower), access to health care (lower), and treatment by clinic staff (poorer) - accounted for 19.3% of the variance in nonadherence. Results of this study indicated that several individual predisposing and enabling factors were potential predictors of treatment nonadherence; however, system enabling factors, e.g., treatment by clinic staff were also associated with treatment nonadherence. Further studies are needed to examine the complex relationships of individual and system related factors in predicting treatment nonadherence."
4948,0.01,2.0000,"This paper assesses the extent of the financial burden due to out-of-pocket payments for health care incurred by people living with HIV (PLHIV) and the effect of this burden on their financial capacity. Data were collected in a cross-sectional survey of 353 PLHIV from three cities in Indonesia (Jakarta, Jogjakarta and Merauke). Respondents in Jakarta were sampled from one hospital and one non-governmental organization working with PLHIV. In Jogjakarta and Merauke, all HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) who came to selected hospitals during the interview period were asked to participate in the survey. The survey collected data on the frequency and extent of payments for HIV-related care, with answers cross-checked against medical records. Results show that PLHIV had different burdens of payments in the different geographical areas. On average, respondents in Jogjakarta spent 68%, and PLHIV on ART in Jakarta spent 96%, of monthly expenditure for HIV-related care, indicating a substantial financial burden for many ART patients. These patients depended on several sources of finance to cover the costs of their care, with donations from their immediate family being the most common method, selling assets and payments from personal income being the second most common method in Jakarta and Jogjakarta, respectively. Most PLHIV in these two areas did not have insurance. In Merauke, there were little observed out-of-pocket payments because the government covers medical costs via the local budget and health insurance for the poor. The results of this study confirm previous findings that providing subsidized ART drugs alone does not ensure financial accessibility to HIV care. Thus, the government of Indonesia at central and local levels should consider covering HIV care additional to providing antiretroviral drugs free of charge. Social health insurance should also be encouraged."
3105,0.01,2.0000,"The emergence of T cell-tropic, syncytium-inducing (T-tropic/SI) HIV-1 variants from the background of macrophage-tropic, non-syncytium-inducing (M-tropic/NSI) strains is associated with disease progression in infected individuals. HIV89.6 is a primary isolate with a transitional phenotype: like M-tropic strains it replicates in primary macrophages and lymphocytes but not in most transformed cells, yet it is also syncytium inducing. We have shown that HIV89.6 can utilize both the M-tropic and T-tropic cofactors CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, in conjunction with CD4 for fusion and entry into otherwise nonpermissive nonhuman cells. To better understand the nature of restricted HIV89.6 infection of transformed cells, we analyzed its interaction with CD4-expressing transformed human HeLaCD4-LTR/beta-Gal cells, which contain the beta-galactosidase gene linked to the HIV-1 LTR. Here we show that HIV89.6 enters these cells and undergoes reverse transcription and integration. Furthermore, HIV89.6 induces LTR-driven beta-galactosidase expression, indicating Tat-dependent trans-activation, in a similar number of cells as the permissive T-tropic/SI isolate HIV(HXB). Acute infection with HIV89.6, however, produces markedly lower levels of p24 antigen and infectious virus per trans-activation-positive cell than HIV(HXB). In contrast, transfection results in high levels of expression for both viruses but HIV89.6 still fails to establish spreading infection. HIV89.6 is also blocked after entry in two other nonpermissive cell lines, SUP-T1 and U937. HIV89.6 arrest in HeLaCD4-LTR/beta-Gal cells at a stage subsequent to entry, reverse transcription, integration, and Tat expression is a novel level at which HIV-1 strain- and cell-specific restrictions define host cell tropism. These studies emphasize that complex patterns of tropism are determined by the interplay of permissive or restricted virus-cell interactions at multiple steps in the replication cycle."
4427,0.01,2.0000,"In recent years, it has become apparent that the lung is an important niche for the proliferation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which may have implications for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The lung itself is a major site for the opportunistic infections associated with the progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), specifically Pneumocystis carinii, Myobacterium tuberculosis and pyogenic bacteria. These cases of active pulmonary complications are direct indicators of enhanced progression to AIDS-defining illness and increased morbidity and mortality. It is therefore essential that the interaction between the lung and HIV is fully understood. Recent research indicates the lung may be a major sanctuary for the virus, with distinct evolution and replication in contrast to other target organs for HIV. In this review, we will discuss the recent findings of HIV infection, evolution, host factors involved in the control of HIV within the lung and the impact this may have on current therapy."
8468,0.01,2.0000,"Recently, a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutant with HBe antigen-negative phenotype has been characterized, in which one TATA box-like motif of the precore/core promoter had degenerated: most frequently by both A-->T and G-->A mutations at positions 1762 and 1764, respectively. The clinical significance of this mutant is as yet unknown. In our present study, the T1762 A1764 mutant was sought in sera from HBV-infected blood donors and chronic liver disease patients by directly sequencing a PCR-amplified region of HBVDNA. Also, because the A1764 mutation generates a Sau3AI cleavage site (GGTC-->GATC), we digested the PCR products with Sau3AI to see if cleavage would occur at this specific site. Our results mostly corroborated the earlier report but we found a higher-than-predicted frequency of HBe antigen-positive blood donors positive for the mutant (22%). The titres of HBe antigen in these mutant-positive sera were slightly decreased compared to the titres in wild-type HBV infection. In addition, these blood donors had relatively high (though within the normal range) serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, suggesting that the T1762 A1764 mutation could be used as a sensitive laboratory marker for insidious hepatitis in these otherwise 'asymptomatic' carriers. The Sau3AI assay, which is much more convenient than sequencing, was shown to be useful for the detection of the T1762 A1764 mutant in an extensive number of clinical samples."
1283,0.01,2.0000,"AIDS is an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome defined by a severe depletion of T cells and over 20 conventional degenerative and neoplastic diseases. In the U.S. and Europe, AIDS correlates to 95% with risk factors, such as about 8 years of promiscuous male homosexuality, intravenous drug use, or hemophilia. Since AIDS also correlates with antibody to a retrovirus, confirmed in about 40% of American cases, it has been hypothesized that this virus causes AIDS by killing T cells. Consequently, the virus was termed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and antibody to HIV became part of the definition of AIDS. The hypothesis that HIV causes AIDS is examined in terms of Koch's postulates and epidemiological, biochemical, genetic, and evolutionary conditions of viral pathology. HIV does not fulfill Koch's postulates: (i) free virus is not detectable in most cases of AIDS; (ii) virus can only be isolated by reactivating virus in vitro from a few latently infected lymphocytes among millions of uninfected ones; (iii) pure HIV does not cause AIDS upon experimental infection of chimpanzees or accidental infection of healthy humans. Further, HIV violates classical conditions of viral pathology. (i) Epidemiological surveys indicate that the annual incidence of AIDS among antibody-positive persons varies from nearly 0 to over 10%, depending critically on nonviral risk factors. (ii) HIV is expressed in less than or equal to 1 of every 10(4) T cells it supposedly kills in AIDS, whereas about 5% of all T cells are regenerated during the 2 days it takes the virus to infect a cell. (iii) If HIV were the cause of AIDS, it would be the first virus to cause a disease only after the onset of antiviral immunity, as detected by a positive ""AIDS test."" (iv) AIDS follows the onset of antiviral immunity only after long and unpredictable asymptomatic intervals averaging 8 years, although HIV replicates within 1 to 2 days and induces immunity within 1 to 2 months. (v) HIV supposedly causes AIDS by killing T cells, although retroviruses can only replicate in viable cells. In fact, infected T cells grown in culture continue to divide. (vi) HIV is isogenic with all other retroviruses and does not express a late, AIDS-specific gene. (vii) If HIV were to cause AIDS, it would have a paradoxical, country-specific pathology, causing over 90% Pneumocystis pneumonia and Kaposi sarcoma in the U.S. but over 90% slim disease, fever, and diarrhea in Africa.(viii) It is highly improbable that within the last few years two viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2) that are only 40% sequence-related would have evolved that could both cause the newly defined syndrome AIDS. Also, viruses are improbable that kill their only natural host with efficiencies of 50-100%, as is claimed for HIVs. It is concluded that HIV is not sufficient for AIDS and that it may not even be necessary for AIDS because its activity is just as low in symptomatic carriers as in asymptomatic carriers. The correlation between antibody to HIV and AIDS does not prove causation, because otherwise indistinguishable diseases are now set apart only on the basis of this antibody. I propose that AIDS is not a contagious syndrome caused by one conventional virus or microbe. No such virus or microbe would require almost a decade to cause primary disease, nor could it cause the diverse collection of AIDS diseases. Neither would its host range be as selective as that of AIDS, nor could it survive if it were as inefficiently transmitted as AIDS. Since AIDS is defined by new combinations of conventional diseases, it may be caused by new combinations of conventional pathogens, including acute viral or microbial infections and chronic drug use and malnutrition. The long and unpredictable intervals between infection with HIV and AIDS would then reflect the thresholds for these pathogenic factors to cause AIDS diseases, instead of an unlikely mechanism of HIV pathogenesis."
5450,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global major health problem. Currently, 10 genotypes (A-J) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are identified based on the nucleic acid sequence heterogeneity, and these genotypes have been shown to have distinct geographic distribution. Reports of the previous studies indicated that the genotype D is the predominant type among hepatitis B patients in different regions of Turkey. However, recent studies indicated that other HBV genotypes are also seen with an increasing rate. Although epidemiological and clinical information on genotype E infection is currently limited, it is known that genotype E infection is common in West and Central Africa. In this report, the first case of HBV genotype E infection in Turkey was presented. A 22-year-old Nigerian male employee who resided in Manisa for five years was admitted to Celal Bayar University Hospital Manisa, Turkey, for his routine check-up. Since HBsAg was found positive, other HBV markers were tested with a repeated serum sample. Laboratory findings were as follows; HBsAg (+), anti-HBs (-), HBeAg (-), anti-HBe (+), anti-HBc (+), anti-HCV (-), anti-HIV (-), ALT: 44 U/L and AST: 45 U/L. HBV-DNA level was detected as 700 IU/ml by real-time PCR (Artus HBV QS RGQ Qiagen, Germany). HBV-DNA isolated from the serum sample of the patient was amplified by PCR and polymerase gene segment of HBV was directly sequenced. UPGMA method was used for phylogenetic analysis and Inno-LIPA HBV genotyping method (Innogenetics, Belgium) was performed to determine multiple HBV genotype infection. On the basis of those methods the genotype of the virus was identified as genotype E. The partial sequences of the HBV polymerase gene were loaded to the international DNA data bank (GenBank) for contribution to the global HBV surveillance. This report emphasized that besides genotype D the other HBV genotypes could be found in Turkey. Since the patient was an inactive HBsAg carrier before his residence in Turkey, this case was regarded as an imported HBV genotype E case. In conclusion, detection of different HBV genotypes, their epidemiology and molecular characteristics are important for both national and global HBV surveillance and better clinical approach. "
57,0.01,2.0000,"We wished to undertake molecular characterization of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene and overlapping surface (S) gene in lamivudine-treated patients with chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sequencing analyses of the HBV RT/S gene of isolates from 25 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with the YMDD mutation and 30 treatment-na√Øve CHB patients were undertaken. In patients with the YMDD mutation, rtM2041 was the major type of mutation (20/25, 80%). rtL80I was present in most of the patients with rtM204I (14/20, 70%). rtL180M coexisted with rtM204V (5/5, 100%). Patients with the YMDD mutation had a significantly higher prevalence of mutation of the RT gene than treatment-na√Øve CHB patients (P < 0.05). Classical primary resistance and secondary/compensatory mutations were detected at only five sites (rtL80, rtV173, rtL180, rtM204, rtM250) in CHB patients with the YMDD mutation. The frequency of nucleos(t)ide analog resistance (NAr) mutation within the RT gene in patients with the YMDD mutation was significantly higher than that in treatment-na√Øve patients (P < 0.05). Amino-acid mutations within the RT gene were also associated with other types of NAr in patients with the YMDD mutation. The rate of amino-acid variants within the S gene region was significantly higher in patients with the YMDD mutation than that in treatment-na√Øve patients (P < 0.05). sM133L and sG145R variants were also present in patients with the YMDD mutation. These observations suggest that CHB patients with the YMDD mutation also have NAr mutations related to other NA drugs, which might lead to cross-resistance in CHB patients. Variants present in the S gene region could cause changes in the antigenicity of HBsAg, which could result in a false-negative diagnosis of HBsAg and immune in escape of the HBV."

Overall, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected in 24 subjects (10%), of whom 22 (92%) had detectable HBV DNA. Surprisingly, HDV RNA was detectable in 20 (83%) of the 24 HBsAg-positive subjects. HCV-associated antibodies were detected in 41 (16%) and HCV RNA was detected in 36 (14%) subjects, none of whom was coinfected with HBV, indicating that HBV/HCV carriers account for one-fourth of this population. Antibodies to HAV and HEV were detected in 249 (100%) and 28 (11%) subjects, respectively. Of 22 HBV DNA-positive subjects, genotype D was detected in 21 subjects and genotype F was detected in 1 subject. All 20 HDV isolates recovered from HDV RNA-positive subjects segregated into genotype I, but these differed by 2.1 to 11.4% from each other in the 522- to 526-nucleotide sequence. Of 36 HCV RNA-positive samples, 35 (97%) were genotype 1b and 1 was genotype 2a. Reflecting an extremely high prevalence of hepatitis virus infections, there were no appreciable differences in the prevalence of hepatitis virus markers between the two studied populations with distinct living place and lifestyle. A nationwide epidemiological survey of hepatitis viruses should be conducted in an effort to prevent de novo infection with hepatitis viruses in Mongolia."

Blood aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cholesterol, triglycerides, and total bilirubin were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (HAART group) or 3 month intervals (control group). Serum HIV RNA level (viral load) was determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) GP73 concentration were determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay kit and western blot, respectively. Significant positive and negative correlations in baseline serum GP73 concentration and HIV viral load (r = 0.39, P < 0.001) and CD4 + T cell count (r = -0.501, P < 0.001) were observed, respectively. In receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.79 (95 % CI 0.66-0.92). The sensitivity and specificity of GP73 for correct identification of patients with ‚â§350 CD4 + T cells/ŒºL were 76.09 and 75.0 %, respectively, with an ROC-derived cut-off of 100.6 ng/mL.

1603,0.01,2.0000,"Lentiviral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) show great promise as gene carriers for future gene therapy. Insertion of a fragment containing the central polypurine tract (cPPT) in HIV-1 vector constructs is known to enhance transduction efficiency drastically, reportedly by facilitating the nuclear import of HIV-1 cDNA through a central DNA flap. We have studied the impact of the cPPT on the kinetics of HIV-1 vector transduction by real-time PCR. The kinetics of total HIV-1 DNA, two-long-terminal-repeat (2-LTR) circles, and, by an Alu-PCR, integrated proviral DNA were monitored. About 6 to 12 h after transduction, the total HIV-1 DNA reached a maximum level, followed by a steep decrease. The 2-LTR circles peaked after 24 to 48 h and were diluted upon cell division. Integration of HIV-1 DNA was first detected at 12 h postinfection. When HIV-1 vectors that contained the cPPT were used, DNA synthesis was similar but a threefold higher amount of 2-LTR circles was detected, confirming the impact on nuclear import. Moreover, a 10-fold increase in the amount of integrated DNA was observed in the presence of the cPPT. Only in the absence of the cPPT was a saturation in 2-LTR circle formation seen at a high multiplicity of infection, suggesting a role for the cPPT in overcoming a barrier to the nuclear import of HIV-1 DNA. A major effect of the central DNA flap on the juxtaposition of both LTRs is unlikely, since transduction with HIV-1 vectors containing ectopic cPPT fragments resulted in increased amounts of 2-LTR circles as well as integrated DNA. Inhibitors of transduction by cPPT-containing HIV vectors were also studied by real-time PCR. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine (AZT) and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor alpha-APA clearly inhibited viral DNA synthesis, whereas integrase inhibitors such as the diketo acid L-708,906 and the pyranodipyrimidine V-165 specifically inhibited integration."

This pre- and postintervention study assessed the impact of pharmacist intervention on improving the use of prophylactic medications for opportunistic infections (OI). Of the 139 patients screened, 42 patients were included in the prospective intervention group. A total of 27 interventions were made on 15 patients, and 24 recommendations (89%) were accepted by providers.

5732,0.01,2.0000,"Vicriviroc (VCV) is a small-molecule CCR5 coreceptor antagonist currently in clinical trials for treatment of R5-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. With this drug in development, identification of resistance mechanisms to VCV is needed to allow optimal outcomes in clinical practice. In this study we further characterized VCV resistance in a lab-adapted, VCV-resistant RU570 virus (RU570-VCV(res)). We show that K305R, R315Q, and K319T amino acid changes in the V3 loop, along with P437S in C4, completely reproduced the resistance phenotype in a chimeric ADA envelope containing the C2-V5 region from RU570 passage control gp120. The K305R amino acid change primarily impacted the degree of resistance, whereas K319T contributed to both resistance and virus infectivity. The P437S mutation in C4 had more influence on the relative degree of virus infectivity, while the R315Q mutation contributed to the virus concentration-dependent phenotypic resistance pattern observed for RU570-VCV(res). RU570-VCV(res) pseudovirus entry with VCV-bound CCR5 was dramatically reduced by Y10A, D11A, Y14A, and Y15A mutations in the N terminus of CCR5, whereas these mutations had less impact on entry in the absence of VCV. Notably, an additional Q315E/I317F substitution in the crown region of the V3 loop enhanced resistance to VCV, resulting in a stronger dependence on the N terminus for viral entry. By fitting the envelope mutations to a molecular model of a recently described docked N-terminal CCR5 peptide consisting of residues 2 to 15 in complex with HIV-1 gp120 CD4, potential new interactions in gp120 with the N terminus of CCR5 were uncovered. The cumulative results of this study suggest that as the RU570 VCV-resistant virus adapted to use the drug-bound receptor, it also developed an increased reliance on the N terminus of CCR5."

Therefore, markers of either active or past HBV infection are present in many HIV-infected patients, particularly in intravenous drug users (IDUs). The aim of this study was to analyze the serological pattern of past HBV infection (presence or absence of anti-HBs) and the course of past HBV infection (changes in anti-HBs status, and HBV reactivation) in two cohorts of IDUs with and without HIV infection."
3962,0.005,1.0000,"Serological markers of hepatitis A, B, and Delta and human immunodeficiency viruses were studied in 25 children receiving cancer chemotherapy. Eighty-eight percent had pre-existing HAV immunity which was unaltered by chemotherapy. HDV infection was observed in 8% while HIV was conspicuous by its absence. Active HBV infection, observed in 76% of the children, was asymptomatic in the majority and was accompanied by a high incidence of HBe antigenaemia (57.9%) and its persistence. Pre-existing anti-HBs failed to prevent HBV infection recurrence, which was, however, transient and self-limiting. Multiple blood transfusions and repeated parenteral exposures appeared to be the possible sources of HBV acquisition. Transmission to close contacts was also observed. The study suggests that although HBV vaccine might not be protective against HBV infection in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy, it may prevent its persistence and thereby help in reducing chronic liver disease-related morbidity and a highly infectious reservoir. Strict HBV screening of blood donors, exclusive use of disposable equipment, and vaccination of close contacts of cancer patients is recommended, particularly in HBV endemic third-world countries."
7683,0.005,1.0000,"The T-cell-mediated immune response plays a crucial role in defense against hepatotropic viruses as well as in the pathogenesis of viral chronic hepatitides. However, very little is known about the role of specific T cells during hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in humans. In this study, the T-cell response to HDV in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers with HDV superinfection was investigated at different levels. Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation in response to a recombinant form of large hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) revealed that 8 of 30 patients studied (27%) specifically responded to HDAg. By employing synthetic peptides spanning the entire HDAg sequence, we found that T-cell recognition was directed against different antigenic determinants, with patient-to-patient variation in the pattern of response to peptides. Interestingly, all responders had signs of inactive HDV-induced disease, while none of the patients with active disease and none of the control subjects showed any significant proliferation. More accurate information about the specific T-cell response was obtained at the clonal level. A panel of HDAg-specific CD4+ T-cell clones from three HDV-infected individuals and fine-specificity analysis revealed that the clones tested individually recognized four epitopes corresponding to amino acids (aa) 26 to 41, 50 to 65, 66 to 81, or 106 to 121 of HDAg sequence. The study of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction revealed that peptides 50 to 65 and 106 to 121 were presented to specific T cells in association with multiple class II molecules. In addition, peptide 26 to 41 was efficiently generated after processing of HDAg through the endogenous processing pathway. Cytokine secretion analysis showed that all the CD4+ T-cell clones assayed were able to produce high levels of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), belonging either to T helper-1 (Th1) or Th0 subsets and that some of them were cytotoxic in a specific assay. This study provides the first evidence that detection of a specific T-cell response to HDAg in the peripheral blood of individuals with hepatitis delta is related to the decrease of HDV-induced disease activity. The HDAg epitopes identified here and particularly those recognized by CD4+ T cells in association with multiple major histocompatibility complex class II molecules may be potentially exploited for the preparation of a vaccine for prophylaxis and therapy of HDV infection."
7089,0.005,1.0000,"Monocytes and macrophages (Mo/Mphi) contribute to the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. A successful hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC)-based gene therapy strategy for HIV-1 disease must protect Mo/Mphi as well as T cells from HIV-1-related pathology. In this report, we demonstrate that RevM10-transduced HSPCs isolated from cytokine-mobilized peripheral blood give rise to Mo/Mphi suppressing replication of Mphi-tropic HIV-1 isolates. A Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based retroviral vector encoding a bicistronic mRNA co-expressing RevM10 and the murine CD8alpha' chain (Lyt2) was used to transduce HSPCs. Following transduction, these cells were expanded and differentiated by short-term culture in methylcellulose containing various cytokines. In vitro differentiated Mo/Mphi were enriched by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for the co-expressed transgene (Lyt2) and myelomonocytic (CD33, CD14) surface markers. HIV-1 replication of two Mphi-tropic isolates (JR-FL, BaL) was inhibited in Mo/Mphi expressing RevM10 and Lyt2 relative to control cells expressing only Lyt2 but no functional RevM10 gene product. Cell proliferation and expression of lineage-specific surface markers was not altered in transduced, in vitro differentiated Mo/Mphi cells. This study supports the feasibility of HSPC-based gene therapy as a future treatment for HIV-1 disease."
3784,0.005,1.0000,"High levels of circulating soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors (sTNF-R) are associated with HIV-1 infection and disease. To understand better this association, we have investigated p55 and p75 TNF-R expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subsets and in the promonocytic cell line U937, with or without HIV infection. Using flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies both to sTNF-R and to PBMC subsets, TNF-R were found to be expressed mostly by monocytes and in decreasing amounts and intensity in the following order: CD14+ cells > CD8+ cells > CD4+ cells. Expression of TNF-R was higher on cells obtained from HIV-infected than from noninfected subjects, and expression of p75 sTNF-R was much higher than that of p55 sTNF-R. Studying the U937 cells revealed that over 80% of the cells expressed both sTNF-R, but with greater fluorescence intensity in the HIV-1 chronically infected cells (U-937-IIIB). Treatment of the cells with PMA caused an accelerated release into the medium of both sTNF-R, with a sharp decline in their cell surface expression. Basal levels of mRNA transcripts for p75 TNF-R were higher in the U-937-IIIB cells than in the uninfected cells, but p55 TNF-R mRNA was expressed only in the HIV-1-infected cells. These findings show that HIV-1 infection is accompanied by predominant elevation of p75 TNF-R surface expression on monocytes and CD8+ lymphocytes, and results in both increased message and expression of these receptors in monocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3213,0.005,1.0000,"A small number of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) remain clinically and immunologically healthy for more than a decade after infection. Recent reports suggest that these individuals may be infected with an attenuated strain of HIV-1; however, a common genetic basis for viral attenuation has not been found in all cases. In the present study, we examined the functional properties of the HIV-1 env genes from six long-term survivors. env clones were generated by PCR amplification of proviral env sequences, followed by cloning of the amplified regions into expression vectors. Eight to ten clones from each subject were screened by transient transfection for expression of the envelope precursor glycoprotein, gp160. Those clones expressing gp160 were then cotransfected with an HIV-1 luciferase reporter vector, pNL4-3Env(-)LUC(+) and evaluated for their ability to mediate infection of phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in single-cycle infectivity assays. Clones expressing gp160 were identified for all six long-term survivors, indicating the presence of proviral env genes with intact open reading frames. For two subjects, D and DH, the encoded envelope glycoproteins yielded high levels of luciferase activity when pseudotyped onto HIV-1 virions and tested in single-cycle infectivity assays. In contrast, envelope glycoproteins cloned from four other long-term survivors were poorly processed and failed to mediate infection. Sequencing of the gp120/41 cleavage site and conserved gp41 cysteine residues of these clones did not reveal any obvious mutations to explain the functional defects. The functional activity of env clones from long-term survivors D and DH was comparable to that seen with several primary HIV-1 env genes cloned from individuals with disease progression and AIDS. These results suggest that the long-term survival of subjects D and DH is not associated with overt functional defects in env; however, functional abnormalities in env may contribute to maintaining a long-term asymptomatic state in the other four cases we studied."
4578,0.005,1.0000,"This study was undertaken to analyze the role of disialoganglioside GD3 in HIV infection and disease progression. We report here the results obtained by both ex vivo and in vitro experiments on (1) surface and cytoplasmic expression and distribution of GD3 in HIV-infected cells, (2) the presence of anti-GD3 antibodies in sera of patients with HIV infection in various stages of the disease, and (3) the association of GD3 expression with HIV-related apoptotic events. GD3 expression was determined by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and lipid-bound sialic acid and by static and flow cytometric analyses in peripheral blood lymphocytes from 22 AIDS patients, 20 anti-HIV Ab(+) asymptomatic subjects, and 25 healthy donors. Results obtained clearly indicated a significantly higher expression of plasma membrane GD3 content in lymphocytes from HIV-infected patients with respect to healthy controls. These HIV-induced perturbations of glycosphingolipid metabolism could be detected in all stages of the disease, including asymptomatic individuals. In addition, a significant percentage of patients showing disease progression displayed in serum samples an increased presence of anti-GD3 antibodies. Interestingly, ex vivo studies of lymphocytes from patients with HIV infection also indicated that GD3 expression is strictly associated with annexin V binding, an early marker of apoptosis. Moreover, cytofluorimetric analysis showed that virtually all anti-p24 Ab-positive cells were also immunolabeled with anti-GD3 antibodies. Accordingly, in vitro studies showed a significant redistribution and increase in GD3 expression in cultured U937 cells chronically infected with HIV-1 with respect to uninfected counterparts. In conclusion, our data clearly indicate that a significant increase in GD3 content in HIV-infected lymphocytes can occur and that this GD3 overexpression is paralleled by the presence of anti-GD3 antibodies in the plasma of patients. This is the first demonstration that disialoganglioside GD3, independent of the therapeutic schedule employed, can be considered as one of the early markers of HIV infection and can contribute to the early events leading to T cell depletion by apoptosis."

9144,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 infection is often complicated by the dysfunction of central nervous system (CNS). Degenerative neuronal changes as well as neuronal loss have been documented in individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) causes similar CNS manifestation and FIV infected cats provide an animal model for human immunodeficiency virus infection in humans. In this study, we examined the brain of FIV-infected cats and controls with immunohistochemical techniques using antibodies to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). We found a significant decrease in expression of MAP-2 and GAD in neurons of infected animals compared to controls. In contrast, the expression of neurofilaments and glial fibrillary acidic protein was rather increased. The changes observed in the brain were similar to those seen in humans undergoing the normal aging process as well as those suffering from neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease and other dementing disorders. These changes in the feline brain give insight into the deleterious effects of FIV on the CNS."
881,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are contagious liver diseases caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV), respectively. In particular, chronic infection with HBV or HCV is a major public health problem throughout Europe. The majority of persons chronically infected (65%-75%) are not aware of their infection status until symptoms of advanced liver disease appear. In addition, the peak in the number of patients suffering from advanced stages of the disease, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, has not yet been reached. In order to reduce the current and future morbidity and mortality associated with chronic HBV or HCV infection, the timely detection of chronically infected persons, with follow-up and case management, is crucial. However, the current screening strategies in Europe and Switzerland have to be considered as inadequate to detect the majority of chronically infected persons. Hence, we emphasise the importance of an alternative approach: the healthcare provider initiated identification of HBV or HCV infection in defined risk groups. This entails determining whether a person is not only at risk of being chronically infected, but also at risk of becoming infected with HBV or HCV and, if necessary, testing for HBV or HCV infection."

The tetrapeptide tip of the V3 loop was invariant for 10 of the 11 seroconverters, and identical to that observed in sequences derived from the 1990-1992 group. However, in the V3 region, sequences from 2 of the 11 subjects demonstrated more than 5 amino acid changes relative to the reference strains.

5454,0.005,1.0000,"In the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, the incidence of non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADC) has increased and contributes to a growing proportion of mortality in the aging HIV-infected population. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of increased cancer risk are incompletely understood. Potential contributors include oncogenic effects of the HIV virus, immunosuppression, chronic inflammation and immune activation, exposure to HAART, higher rates of oncogenic viral coinfections and traditional cancer risk factors. HIV-infected patients often present with NADC at younger ages with more aggressive or advanced stage disease. However, when standard cancer therapy is given, treatment outcomes appear similar to the non-HIV population. These facts highlight the importance of clinicians' maintaining a high index of suspicion, performing age-appropriate screening, and optimizing cancer therapy. Development of novel strategies for screening, prevention, and treatment of NADC will be required to reverse these epidemiologic trends and improve the survival of HIV-infected patients. "

The proportion of patients with a late diagnosis, carried out in full-blown AIDS stage, remains high. Skin and mucous membrane manifestations are not rare in these patients. Objective A demographic, clinical, and laboratorial characterization of patients with de novo HIV infection diagnosis made in the Department of Dermatology and Venereology of a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of adult patients newly diagnosed with HIV infection (reactive immunoassay for antibodies to HIV-1/HIV-2 or HIV p24 antigen) in the Dermatology and Venereology Department of a Portuguese central hospital in the period between January 2005 and December 2013. Results During the study period, 97 new cases were diagnosed, 70 men and 27 women. The median age at diagnosis was 36 years. Of the total, 50 cases were diagnosed with a concomitant sexually transmitted infection (STI), more frequently syphilis and ano-genital HPV infection. The remaining 47 patients were diagnosed with other dermatological conditions such as prurigo nodularis, psoriasis, and Kaposi's sarcoma. The duration of complaints that lead to medical attention ranged from <1 week to 8 years, being significantly lower in patients diagnosed with a concomitant STI ( p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). Basal viral load was also lower in this group of patients ( p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). Of all the new diagnosed cases, 80% of patients are currently retained in care. Conclusion This study grants a descriptive overview of de novo HIV infection diagnoses performed by dermatovenereologists in a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. As in the past, the importance of Dermato-Venereology for HIV infection diagnosis remains present in daily clinical practice."

Urban minority populations in particular are affected by both the HIV/AIDS and chronic disease epidemics. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of and risk factors for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes among HIV-infected adults in the Bronx and describe comorbidity-related treatment outcomes. This was a cross-sectional study of 854 HIV-positive adults receiving care at 11 clinics which provide HIV primary care services; clinics were affiliated with a large urban academic medical center. Data on blood pressure (BP), cholesterol, and glycemic control were collected through standardized chart review of outpatient medical records. We found prevalence rates of 26%, 48%, and 13% for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, respectively. Older age, obesity, family history, and current protease inhibitor use were consistently associated with comorbidity. Diabetes treatment goals were achieved less often than BP and lipid goals, and concurrent diabetes was a significant predictor for BP and lipid control. In conclusion, major cardiovascular-related comorbidities are prevalent among HIV-positive adults in the Bronx, especially older and obese individuals. Differences exist in comorbidity-related treatment outcomes, especially for patients with concurrent diabetes. Because cardiovascular risk is modifiable, effective treatment of related comorbidities may improve morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients."

In addition, 1440 specimens from the patients attending STD clinic of the same hospital and 862 females seeking termination of pregnancy from a near by hospital were included for comparison. It was found that only 3 individuals with high risk behaviours out of 2002 females attending antenatal clinic showed evidence of HIV infection (rate 1.49 per 1000). The corresponding rate for the group of patients attending STD clinic and seeking termination of pregnancy were 3 out of 1440 (rate 2.15 per 1000) and 1 out of 862 (rate 1.16 per 1000) respectively. It was noted that prevalence of HIV infection in the hospital attending population with unspecified risk factor (medical, surgical and antenatal clinics) was not a matter of serious concern.

This paper reported the implementation of a simple PCR procedure to detect JCV in the CSF in a cohort of HIV-1 infected patients from Argentina. Years ago, the confirmatory diagnosis of this disease was made by in-situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry techniques on brain biopsies. The PCR procedure described here improves the diagnosis of PML because it is simple and noninvasive, and allows the differential diagnosis of PML from other neurological syndromes associated with AIDS. Many recent studies report a significant benefit of combined antiretroviral therapy on the survival of HIV patients without clear neurological improvements. A negative correlation has been described between the concentration of JCV in the CSF and survival time in HIV-1 infected patients, and the level of immune depression may influence JCV replication. This suggests that a single CSF JCV viral load determination during the course of PML disease progression may be of prognostic value for managing HIV patients."

6275,0.005,1.0000,"The fear of malevolent use of variola virus by terrorists has led to the implementation of a health care worker vaccination program and to the consideration of vaccination for the general public. However, due to concerns about side effects of the classical smallpox vaccine, especially for immunocompromised individuals, a safer vaccine is urgently needed. We characterized the immunogenicity of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), one of the more promising alternative smallpox vaccines, in a cohort of 10 chronically HIV-1-infected individuals undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Nine subjects received smallpox vaccination as children while one subject was never vaccinated against smallpox. All the subjects had CD4 counts >400 cells/mm(3) and 8 out of 10 had undetectable viral loads. MVA was able to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses in the majority of individuals. Vaccinia-specific antibodies were mainly of the IgG class while T cells specific to vaccinia were predominantly CD8(+). The immune responses were maintained over 1 year. Similar vaccinia specific humoral immune responses were observed when our cohort of HIV-1-infected individuals was compared to smallpox-vaccinated healthy subjects. The observed immune responses suggest that the highly attenuated MVA could be used as a substitute vaccine against smallpox in chronically HIV-1-infected individuals undergoing HAART."

Performances were evaluated for the Murex Ag/Ab, anti-HCV, and HCV RNA in the HIV/HCV and uremia patient groups. In the HCV group, all 102 samples showed concordant positive and negative results for anti-HCV, Murex Ag/Ab, and HCV RNA tests. In the HIV/HCV group, all 100 samples were positive for both anti-HCV and Murex Ag/Ab tests, whereas 88 patients (88%) were HCV RNA positive.

The effect highly active antiretroviral therapy on pulmonary artery pressure has been an area of controversy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of antiretroviral therapy on pulmonary hypertension in HIV patients. This prospective cohort study was performed in a peripheral medical college of West Bengal with 88 patients from October 2008 to September 2011. By echocardiography, pulmonary artery pressure was recorded before initiation of antiretroviral therapy. After one year of antiretroviral therapy repeat echocardiography was done and pulmonary artery pressure was evaluated. The values were analysed. The present study showed that highly active antiretroviral therapy improves pulmonary artery pressure in HIV/AIDS patients if instituted at early stages (WHO classes I and II). However, at more advanced stages of pulmonary artery hypertension, it does not have any significant effect on reduction of the same. The present study documents that early detection of pulmonary artery hypertension in HIV/AIDS patients is essential and prompt institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy should be considered in them even when those patients do not fulfill the conventional criteria for initiation of this treatment."
533,0.005,1.0000,"The HCV (hepatitis C virus) Serotyping 1-6 Assay (Murex Laboratories) was evaluated on 303 French HCV-infected patients. Serological typing results were compared to the genotypes obtained from sequence analyses of the 5' noncoding regions of the virus genome from 46 HCV-infected patients, and assay specificity was found to be high (97.6%). The serological typing assay, run in 257 consecutive HCV-infected patients, yielded an assay sensitivity lower (70.6%) than that previously reported. This finding was attributed mainly to nonreactive sera from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients (P < 0.001) and perhaps reflected cryoglobulin positivity in others. No anti-type 6 reactivity was detected, and the overall serological type distribution values for types 1 to 5 were 67.3, 7.9, 16.4, 6.6, and 0.9%, respectively. A higher prevalence of type 4 was noted among HIV-infected patients (P < 0.001). In addition, serotype 2 was significantly more frequent in cryoglobulinemia positive than in cryoglobulinemia-negative patients (P < 0.05). Although an initial high level (7%) of mixed serological typing reactivities was found, after predilution of serum only two mixed infections could be confirmed (0.9%). It is suggested, therefore, that mixed reactivities have to be interpreted carefully and retested with prediluted serum, particularly when the optical density of the reactivity is > 2.5 or remains > 0.4 after competition with all type-specific peptides. The high specificity and relatively good sensitivity even in immunocompromised patients obtained with this assay indicate that it can be used routinely. Because response to treatment is linked to HCV type, this assay could be used to identify HCV serotype to guide therapeutic decisions."

We therefore studied the prevalence of HDV infection in HBV-infected patients using tests for anti-HDV and HDV ribonucleic acid (RNA)."
9794,0.005,1.0000,"Viral liver diseases are frequent comorbidities and major contributors to death in HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Although cure of hepatitis C and control of hepatitis B with antivirals avert liver disease progression in most HIV-coinfected patients, the lack of satisfactory treatment for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection remains a major threat for developing cirrhosis and liver cancer in this population. In the European Union (EU) and North America, sexual contact has replaced injection drug use that has been the major transmission route for HDV in HIV-positive persons. PegIFNŒ± is the only approved HDV therapy; however, sustained HDV-RNA clearance is achieved by less than 25%. The recent discovery of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide as the key hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV cell entry receptor has opened the door to a new therapeutic era. Indeed, promising results have been released using Myrcludex-B, a sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide inhibitor. More encouraging are data with new classes of HDV blockers, such as prenylation inhibitors (i.e. lonafarnib) and nucleic acid polymers. At this time, sustained suppression of HDV replication is the primary goal of HDV therapy, as it is associated with normalization of liver enzymes and histological improvement. Of note, the use of specific antivirals for HDV must be given along with anti-HBV agents to prevent HBV rebounds following removal of viral interference. The lack of persistent forms of HDV-RNA could provide a unique opportunity for curing hepatitis delta, even without eliminating HBV circular covalently closed DNA. Ultimately, suppression of HDV replication along with hepatitis B surface antigen clearance once drugs are off would be the best reflect of hepatitis delta cure."
1629,0.005,1.0000,"We sought to determine the prevalence and associated characteristics of hepatitis A, B, C and D viruses and HIV infections in a prison in Durango, Mexico. Sera from 181 inmates were analysed for HAV antibody, hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HCV antibody, HDV antibody, HIV antibody and HCV genotypes. Prevalence of HAV antibody, HBcAb, HBsAg, HCV antibody, HDV antibody and HIV antibody were 99.4, 4.4, 0.0, 10.0, 0.0 and 0.6% respectively. HCV genotype 1a predominated in HCV-infected inmates (62.5%), followed by HCV genotype 1b (25%) and HCV genotype 3 (12.5%). An association between HBV infection and age > 30 years was found. HCV infection was associated with being born in Durango City, history of hepatitis, ear piercing, tattooing, drug abuse history, intravenous drug use and lack of condom use. We concluded that the prevalence of HAV, HBV, HDV and HIV infections in inmates in Durango, Mexico were comparable to those of the Mexican general population and blood donors, but lower than those reported in other prisons around the world. However, HCV infection in inmates was higher than that reported in Mexican blood donors but lower than those reported in other prisons of the world. These results have implications for the optimal planning of preventive and therapeutic measures."
7640,0.005,1.0000,"Dementia was a frequent consequence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in developed countries before antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available and remains a common neurologic complication of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among patients receiving appropriate therapy. The epidemiology of HIV dementia (HIV-D) in Africa remains unclear 20+ years into the AIDS epidemic. Early studies of cognitive impairment in HIV-positive populations in Africa were limited by vaguely defined criteria for cognitive impairment, inadequate assessment tools lacking ecologic validation, and the absence of normative population data. More recent studies have clarified definitions of impairment, utilized more sophisticated measures, and included normative comparisons. Unfortunately, these detailed neuropsychiatric assessments are not feasible for population-based studies or routine clinical implementation. Therefore, the prevalence data available for HIV-D in Africa represents rates found in people presenting to tertiary care centers and are unlikely to reflect HIV-D rates in the general population. As ART becomes available in Africa, future research efforts must provide a better understanding of the epidemiology of HIV-D, the effects of available ART regimens on HIV-D in this population, and the impact of HIV-D on ART adherence. Universally accepted terminology and criteria for HIV-D are needed. Population-based studies will require the development of neuropsychiatric batteries that can be adapted across a range of African environments. Ideally, these measures will be viable for nonphysician care providers to use as screening tools in the first stage of epidemiologic studies. Such screening tools could also serve as clinical indicators of possible HIV-related cognitive impairment facilitate implementation of ART adherence."
6602,0.005,1.0000,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in many developing and developed nations, leading to talk of the ""twin epidemics."" The latest projections from the International Diabetes Federation suggest that 190 million people worldwide currently have type 2 diabetes. In addition, > or = 300 million people worldwide have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). These statistics represent an epidemic of major proportions--possibly the largest epidemic in human history--in terms of glucose intolerance and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk because individuals with IGT are at substantially higher risk for diabetes and CVD than are members of the general population. Along with IGT, the metabolic syndrome comprises other major CVD risk factors, including insulin resistance, central obesity, and dyslipidemia; insulin resistance has been implicated as the single most common cause of the syndrome. Although the exact prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is unknown, the syndrome is widespread among adults in developed nations, becoming more prevalent with age. Epidemiologic data suggest that in patients with schizophrenia or affective disorders, both diabetes and obesity are 1.5 to 2.0 times more prevalent than in the general population. Furthermore, because adverse effects of certain therapies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and psychiatric disorders increase the risk for developing diabetes, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome, such therapies should be carefully chosen, particularly considering CVD risk. Appropriate therapy may be determined via screening of patients for levels of fasting blood glucose and lipids, as well as other CVD risk factors, before initiating use of second-generation antipsychotic agents or highly active antiretroviral therapy."
9118,0.005,1.0000,"In 2015, the infection caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV infection) dominated among life-threatening infections in Russians: it was first diagnosed in 98,177 Russians and 15,530 citizens of the Russian Federation died from HIV/AIDS, amounting to 45% of all deaths from infectious diseases in Russia. By the mid-2016, there were a total of 1,062,476 identified HIV-positive Russians, of whom 225,992 people died. The estimated number of HIV-infected patients in Russia approximated to 1% of the population, the highest prevalence of HIV being found in the age group of 30-40 years. The most active and expensive measures against HIV/AIDS in Russia are to examine the population for anti-HIV antibodies (29 million screenings per year) and to use in HIV-positive people antiretroviral therapy that was free of charge to more than 200,000 patients, i.e. nearly 25% of the registered Russians living with the HIV-infected. However, treatment coverage and quality are far from the target indicators that the international experts consider needed to reduce HIV prevalence and mortality. A wider program on HIV/AIDS, which includes a number of preventive measures with proven efficiency, as well as a program of promising researches and developments should be introduced in Russia."
9174,0.005,1.0000,"Interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced cells express the proteasome subunits low molecular weight protein (LMP)2, LMP7, and MECL-1 (multicatalytic endopeptidase complex-like 1), leading to the formation of immunoproteasomes. Although these subunits are thought to optimize MHC class I antigen processing, the extent of their role and the mechanistic aspects involved remain unclear. Herein, we study the proteolytic generation of an human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-Aw68-restricted hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope that is recognized by peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with acute self-limited but not chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV). Immunological data suggest that IFN-gamma-induced rather than uninduced HeLa cells process and present the HBV CTL epitope upon infection with HBcAg-expressing vaccinia viruses. Analyses of 20S proteasome digests of synthetic polypeptides covering the antigenic HBcAg peptide demonstrate that only immunoproteasomes efficiently perform the cleavages needed for the liberation of this HBV CTL epitope. Although the concerted presence of the three immunosubunits appears essential, we find that both catalytically active LMP7 and inactive LMP7 T1A support CTL epitope generation. We conclude that LMP7 influences the structural features of 20S proteasomes, thereby enhancing the activity of the LMP2 and MECL-1 catalytic sites, which provide cleavage specificity. Thus, LMP7 incorporation is of greater functional importance for the generation of an HBV CTL epitope than cleavage specificity."
8821,0.005,1.0000,"Estimates of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection prevalence varies among different studies depending on the prevalence of HBV infection in the study population and on the sensitivity of the assay used to detect HBV DNA. We investigated the prevalence of occult HBV infection in cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplantation in a Brazilian referral center. Frozen liver samples from 68 adults were analyzed using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay for HBV DNA. The specificity of the amplified HBV sequences was confirmed by direct sequencing of the amplicons. The patient population comprised 49 (72.1%) males and 19 (27.9%) females with a median age of 53 years (range=18-67 years). Occult HBV infection was diagnosed in three (4.4%) patients. The etiologies of the underlying chronic liver disease in these cases were alcohol abuse, HBV infection, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Two of the patients with cryptic HBV infection also presented hepatocellular carcinoma. Markers of previous HBV infection were available in two patients with occult HBV infection and were negative in both. In conclusion, using a sensitive nested polymerase chain reaction assay to detect HBV DNA in frozen liver tissue, we found a low prevalence of occult HBV infection in cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplant, probably due to the low prevalence of HBV infection in our population.

397,0.005,1.0000,"Clearance of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) during acute hepatitis is associated with a strong, polyclonal, multispecific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to the viral envelope, nucleocapsid and polymerase proteins that persists for decades after clinical recovery. In contrast, chronically infected patients usually fail to mount a strong CTL response to this virus. In this study we demonstrate that chronically infected patients who experience a spontaneous or interferon-induced remission develop a CTL response to HBV that is similar in strength and specificity to patients who have recovered from acute hepatitis. The results suggest that specific immunotherapeutic enhancement of the CTL response to HBV should be possible in chronically infected patients, and that it could lead to viral clearance in these individuals with resolution of chronic liver disease."
8589,0.005,1.0000,"Immune responses to components of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are assumed to play an essential role not only in the elimination of the virus but also in the pathogenesis of HBV-induced hepatitis. Protective humoral immunity to HBV is mediated by immune responses to HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). It is important to know which HBsAg preparations induce which type of cellular and humoral immune responses under which immunization conditions. We studied in BALB/c mice the humoral (antibody) response and the class I-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response to different preparations of HBsAg particles: recombinant, small protein particles; plasma-derived, mixed particles formed by large, medium, and small surface proteins; and different preparations of recombinant, mixed particles formed by large and small surface proteins. Specific antibody levels appeared in the sera of immunized mice 2 to 3 weeks after immunization and were correlated with the antigen dose used for priming. HBsAg-specific antibody levels were enhanced by boost injections or by adsorbing the antigen to aluminum hydroxide. Injected in particulate form without adjuvants in the dose range of 0.1 to 10 micrograms per mouse, all HBsAg preparations tested efficiently primed specific CD8+ CTL of defined restriction and epitope specificity. Specific CTL reactivity was detectable from 5 days to more than 4 months postimmunization. In the dose range tested, it was independent of the antigen dose used for immunization and not enhanced by repeated boost injections. CTL were not elicited by HBsAg adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide. We have thus defined conditions under which HBsAg induced preferentially either a cellular immune response or a humoral immune response. These findings may be relevant for the interpretation of HBV-associated immunopathologic phenomena."

However, the clinical implications of these proteins remain largely unknown. In this study, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 124,865 patients with chronic CHB infection were analyzed. Viral genotypes were determined by nested polymerase chain reaction. A chemiluminescent assay was applied to measure HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb, and HBcAb in sera. Among 124,865 patients with CHB infection, 324 (0.3%) were concurrently positive for HBsAg and anti-HBs, and 206 (0.2%) were concurrently positive for HBeAg and anti-HBe. The HBeAg+/anti-HBe+ group was composed of younger patients (P < 0.05). Subgenotype B2 was prevalent in HBV patients concurrently positive for HBeAg and anti-HBe, while HBV patients positive for both HBsAg and anti-HBs exhibited the C2 subgenotype. Among 530 concurrent patients, 126 (39%) HBsAg+/anti-HBs+ patients were in the low-replication phase, and 62 (19%) were in the reactivation phase; 87 (42%) HBeAg+/anti-HBe+, and 19 (6%) HBsAg+/anti-HBs+ patients were in the immune clearance phase. In this large-scale analysis, the clinical and viral characteristics of HBV infections with concurrent HBs Ag/antibody or HBe Ag/antibody presentations have been examined, and the results may contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of CHB patients."

The unexpected clinical and laboratory stabilization of our patient paralleled a progressive increase in his peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (range 410-825 cells/mL) and a relatively controlled HIV viraemia (5970-44,000 HIV-RNA copies/mL). Such a recovery of sufficient immune competency after experiencing four episodes of severe AIDS-associated opportunistic infections, without reliable antiretroviral and antimicrobial support raises several questions."
3538,0.005,1.0000,"Small interfering RNA (siRNA) could provide a new therapeutic approach to treating human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. For long-term suppression of HIV-1, emergence of siRNA escape variants must be controlled. Here, we constructed lentiviral vectors encoding short-hairpin RNAs (shRNA) corresponding to conserved target sequences within the integrase (int) and the attachment site (att) genes, both of which are essential for HIV-1 integration. Compared to shRNA targeting of the HIV-1 transcription factor tat (shTat), shRNA against int (shIN) or the U3 region of att (shU3) showed a more potent inhibitory effect on HIV-1 replication in human CD4+ T cells. Infection with a high dose of HIV-1 resulted in the emergence of escape mutants during long-term culture. Of note, limited genetic variation was observed in the viruses resistant to shIN. A combination of shINs against wild-type and escape mutant sequences had a negative effect on their antiviral activities, indicating a potentially detrimental effect when administering multiple shRNA targeting the same region to combat HIV-1 variants. The combination of shIN and shU3 att exhibited the strongest anti-HIV-1 activity, as seen by complete abrogation of viral DNA synthesis and viral integration. In addition, a modified long-hairpin RNA spanning the 50 nucleotides in the shIN target region effectively suppressed wild-type and shIN-resistant mutant HIV-1. These results suggest that targeting of incoming viral RNA before proviral DNA formation occurs through the use of nonoverlapping multiple siRNAs is a potent approach to achieving sustained, efficient suppression of highly mutable viruses, such as HIV-1."
32,0.005,1.0000,"In the absence of a protective vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there is an urgent need for the development of effective topical microbicides to prevent HIV infection. Candidate vaginal microbicides should provide protection against circulating strains, be cheap, stable on storage, safe and easy to use. Here we describe a detailed study of the safety and efficacy of Cyanovirin-N (CV-N) in vitro, and in an ex vivo model of female genital tissue explants. CV-N demonstrated potent activity in the low nanomolar range against laboratory and primary isolates. Activity was related to the affinity of CV-N for binding to whole virions as determined by acoustic resonance. Potent activity was also observed against cell-associated HIV-1, although slightly reduced. CV-N activity in the presence of whole semen was reduced by 7-10-fold, although it remained in the low nanomolar range and was minimally modified by the presence of Candida albicans. Furthermore, CV-N potently inhibited infection of ectocervical explants and virus dissemination by tissue-emigrating cells. In peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) assays, CV-N was shown to have some mitogenic activity following 3 days exposure to compound, and this was associated with a modest increase in expression of gamma interferon, stromal cell-derived factor 1beta and interleukin 4. However, 2 h exposure to CV-N had no effect on cytokine expression in PBMC or tissue explant culture over a 24 h period, suggesting that the potential for inflammation is low. Data presented here indicate that targeting HIV envelope glycoproteins may provide an effective strategy to prevent HIV-1 infection mediated by either cell-free virus or infected cells."

A total of 726 blood samples were collected from two villages of the Car Nicobar Island where mass vaccination was performed in the year 2000. HBV DNA was isolated and the BCP and PC regions were amplified and sequenced directly. The samples positive for HBV DNA were tested for HBsAg, HBeAg and anti-HBe. Among the 211 and 515 samples collected from vaccinated and nonvaccinated persons, 16 and 82 were positive for HBV DNA, respectively. Among the vaccinated individuals, only 1 had a mutation in both the BCP and PC gene. Among the nonvaccinated subjects, 3 (4.5%) had an A1762T mutation, 8 (12.1%) had a G1764A mutation, 11 (16.7%) had a G1896A mutation and 4 (6.1%) had a G1899A mutation. The HBeAg-negative subjects had a significantly higher frequency of BCP and PC mutations than the HBeAg-positive subjects. The prevalence of a PC mutation was higher than that of a BCP mutation. The present study stresses the need for the continuous surveillance of subjects with BCP and PC mutations, as the mutations may contribute to the progression of liver disease."
7469,0.005,1.0000,"Molecular mechanisms related to occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, particularly those based on genotype C infection, have rarely been determined thus far in the ongoing efforts to determine infection mechanisms. Therefore, we aim to elucidate the mutation patterns in the surface open reading frame (S ORF) underlying occult infections of HBV genotype C in the present study. Nested PCRs were applied to 624 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative Korean subjects. Cloning and sequencing of the S ORF gene was applied to 41 occult cases and 40 control chronic carriers. Forty-one (6.6%) of the 624 Korean adults with HBsAg-negative serostatus were found to be positive for DNA according to nested PCR tests. Mutation frequencies in the three regions labeled here as preS1, preS2, and S were significantly higher in the occult subjects compared to the carriers in all cases. A total of two types of deletions, preS1 deletions in the start codon and preS2 deletions as well as nine types of point mutations were significantly implicated in the occult infection cases. Mutations within the ""a"" determinant region in HBsAg were found more frequently in the occult subjects than in the carriers. Mutations leading to premature termination of S ORF were found in 16 occult subjects (39.0%) but only in one subject from among the carriers (2.5%). In conclusion, our data suggest that preS deletions, the premature termination of S ORF, and ""a"" determinant mutations are associated with occult infections of HBV genotype C among a HBsAg-negative population. The novel mutation patterns related to occult infection introduced in the present study can help to broaden our understanding of HBV occult infections."

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and occult HBV (presence of HBV-DNA in the absence of HBsAg) in a rural, South African cohort. The results were compared to various ethnic groups in a Dutch cohort of people infected with HIV. Antiretroviral-na√Øve individuals with HIV from both a rural South African clinic (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ258), and a Dutch University hospital (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ782), were included. Both serological (HBV and HCV) and molecular (occult HBV) assays were performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to define independent predictors of a hepatitis co-infection. HBV and HCV prevalence rates in the South African cohort were exceptionally low (0.4%, 1/242 and 0.8%, 2/242, respectively), compared to those observed in Caucasians (HBV 4.4% and HCV 10.9%) and African immigrants (HBV 8.9% and HCV 4.8%). Conversely, occult HBV was observed in a considerable proportion (10%, 6/60) of South African patients who were anti-HBc-positive but HBsAg-negative. Occult infections were less frequent in Caucasians and Africans in the Dutch cohort (3.2% and 1.4%, respectively). Independent predictors for occult HBV were not identified, but a trend towards more occult HBV at lower CD4 counts was observed. Local HBV/HCV prevalence data are needed to optimize vaccination and antiretroviral treatment strategies. Occult HBV in patients with HIV may be missed regularly when molecular analyses are not available."
1905,0.005,1.0000,"While the elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a common phenomenon at the end of the acute phase of disease, the persistence of HBV is characteristic for chronic hepatitis (CHB). Recent evidence indicates that the elimination of HBV is achieved by FAS/FAS-L induced apoptosis of infected hepatocytes. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that HBV persistence in the hepatocytes of CHB patients is due to the delayed onset of apoptosis caused by altered FAS/FAS-L interactions between lymphocytes and hepatocytes. The expression of FAS, FAS-L, BAX, BCL-2, ICE and PCNA in the liver biopsies of 55 patients (14 HBsAg positive, 20 patients with alcoholic hepatopathy, 21 patients with other hepatopathies) was tested by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis of hepatocytes was evaluated by morphological as well as by TUNEL method. The results were correlated with a grading/staging score and analysed statistically using a one way analysis of variance and the Duncan test. Significantly highernumbers of BAX positive hepatocytes were observed in HBsAg positive patients when compared to control groups. Similarly, both BAX and FAS positive lymphocytes were more frequent in HBsAg positive patients. FAS-L positive lymphocytes and hepatocytes were numerous in all patient groups. Increased numbers of BAX positive hepatocytes in CHB may reflect the increased readiness of these cells to undergo apoptosis. However, the increased numbers of both BAX and FAS positive lymphocytes in CHB suggest that these cells may be particularly sensitive to FAS-L mediated apoptosis potentially resulting in lowered viability of these lymphocytes. This may explain, at least in part, the defective removal of virus-infected cells in chronic hepatitis. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that survival of hepatocytes during CHB may be due to other mechanisms such as defects in apoptosis activation triggered by CD40, defects involving DNase and/or other caspases downstream in the apoptotic cascade within these cells, or to defects in CTL function."
1691,0.005,1.0000,"Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) infections remain major public health issues globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Impairment of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity by HIV and/or TB infections may limit the host's defences against other pathogens, including the diarrheagenic protozoan Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia intestinalis, and Entamoeba histolytica. During September-December 2015 a cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence and molecular diversity of these enteric parasites among HIV- and/or TB-infected patients at a medical reference centre in Chowke district, southern Mozambique. A total of 99 stool specimens were initially screened by direct microscopy and further confirmed and characterised by molecular methods. DNA sequence analyses of the genes encoding the small subunit ribosomal RNA and the 60-kDa glycoprotein were used for the typing and sub-typing of Cryptosporidium isolates, respectively. G. intestinalis-positive isolates by real-time PCR were subsequently typed at the glutamate dehydrogenase locus. Differential diagnosis of E. histolytica/dispar was achieved by real-time PCR. G. intestinalis (8.1%) was the enteric protozoan more frequently detected, followed by Cryptosporidium spp. (7.1%), and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (6.1%). Two HIV-infected (but not TB-infected) patients harbour G. intestinalis and Cryptosporidium spp. co-infections. Two (29%) G. intestinalis isolates were successfully characterised, revealing the presence of known AII and novel BIV genotypes. Four (57%) Cryptosporidium isolates were unmistakeable assigned to C. hominis, identifying two (IbA10G2 and IdA22) sub-types. Cryptosporidium infections were not associated to diarrhoea in HIV-positive patients, probably because improved immune function in the affected individuals due to antiretroviral therapy. G. intestinalis was considered a non-opportunistic pathogen, whereas the presence of E. histolytica could not be confirmed by molecular methods. Based on their common presence in the studied clinical population, we recommend the effective diagnosis and treatment of these enteropathogens for improving the management of HIV and TB patients."
1545,0.005,1.0000,"A combination of antiviral therapies that target different sites in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replicative cycle may be necessary for optimal treatment of HIV-1 infections. We evaluated the interactions of a soluble virus receptor (recombinant soluble CD4 or rsT4) and a reverse transcriptase inhibitor (azidothymidine, AZT) against HIV-1 replication in vitro. A variety of cell types was studied including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a CD4-positive T-cell line, and a CD4-positive human monocyte cell line. The combination of rsT4 and AZT inhibited HIV-1 synergistically over a broad range of drug concentrations and multiplicities of infection in several different HIV-1 replication assays. Drug interactions were evaluated by the median-effect principle and the isobologram technique using a computer analysis. In all of the cell types tested, combinations of rsT4 and AZT were synergistic in vitro, without additive cytotoxicity."
142,0.005,1.0000,"HAART may increase CD4+ T cell counts despite a persistently detectable HIV load. The impact of HAART on apoptosis, which may play a role in the disease process in HIV-infected patients, has not been extensively studied. We performed a study to compare the level of spontaneous T cell apoptosis and anti-retroviral treatments in a cohort of HIV-1-infected patients. Data were obtained from a computerized medical record. Quantification of apoptotic cells was by cytofluorometric technique. From November 1995 to December 1997 we studied T cell apoptosis in 112 HIV-infected patients. Forty patients were classified A, 36 B and 36 C. Thirty patients were naive and 82 received an anti-retroviral treatment, 49 including a protease inhibitor (PI). The median plasma viraemia determined in 63 patients was 3.6 (range 1.3-5.6) log10. The median apoptotic cell count was 22% (range 2-73%) and 12% (range 2-60%) for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. We did not observe any correlation between the HIV viraemia and the level of apoptosis of T cell subsets. Patients with HAART showed a lower percentage of apoptotic CD4+ T cells only: 16% (range 2-61%) versus 25% (range 5-73%) for patients receiving two nucleoside analogues (P = 0.02). This effect was significant in stage A patients and remained observable during the whole course of HIV disease. In conclusion, HAART, without any relation to plasma viraemia, is able to reduce apoptosis of CD4+ T cells."
348,0.005,1.0000,"We describe the identification of the protozoan parasite Enterocytozoon bieneusi in the stool of a patient who was not infected with HIV but who presented with persistent diarrheal disease and severe abdominal complaints. The patient was not infected with HIV but had been noted to have a decreased CD4 cell count since at least 1992 and had had a prior episode of cryptococcal meningitis. The organisms were detected in stool smears with a modified trichrome stain and were identified to the species level by transmission electron microscopy of the stool. The patient responded readily and dramatically to treatment with albendazole, with resolution of symptoms and clearance of the organisms from the stool. Eight or possibly nine other cases of E. bieneusi infection associated with diarrheal disease in individuals who were not infected with HIV were identified in the English-language literature. In two individuals with intact immune function, symptoms were self-limited and diarrheal disease resolved within 2 weeks. The cases summarized herein suggest that E. bieneusi may be more commonly associated with sporadic diarrheal disease than was previously suspected and that the immune system may play a role in the control of this organism within the intestine."
5636,0.005,1.0000,"We investigated the role of the two highly conserved cysteine residues, cysteines 67 and 95, of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease in regulating the activity of that protease during viral maturation. To this end, we generated four HIV-1 molecular clones: the wild type, containing both cysteine residues; a protease mutant in which the cysteine at position 67 was replaced by an alanine (C67A); a C95A protease mutant; and a double mutant (C67A C95A). When immature virions were produced in the presence of an HIV-1 protease inhibitor, KNI-272, and the inhibitor was later removed, limited polyprotein processing was observed for wild-type virion preparations over a 20-h period. Treatment of immature wild-type virions with the reducing agent dithiothreitol considerably improved the rate and extent of Gag processing, suggesting that the protease is, in part, reversibly inactivated by oxidation of the cysteine residues. In support of this, C67A C95A virions processed Gag up to fivefold faster than wild-type virions in the absence of a reducing agent. Furthermore, oxidizing agents, such as H2O2 and diamide, inhibited Gag processing of wild-type virions, and this effect was dependent on the presence of cysteine 95. Electron microscopy revealed that a greater percentage of double-mutant virions than wild-type virions developed a mature-like morphology on removal of the inhibitor. These studies provide evidence that under normal culture conditions the cysteines of the HIV-1 protease are susceptible to oxidation during viral maturation, thus preventing immature virions from undergoing complete processing following their release. This is consistent with the cysteines being involved in the regulation of viral maturation in cells under oxidative stress."

The recent role out of antiretroviral therapies and new antimalarials, such as artemisinin combination therapies, raise additional concerns regarding possible synergistic and antagonistic effects on efficacy and toxicity. Co-trimoxazole, which is used to prevent opportunistic infections, has been shown to have strong antimalarial prophylactic properties, despite its long-term use and increasing antifolate resistance. The administration of efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, with amodiaquine-artesunate has been associated with increased toxicity. Recent in vivo observations have confirmed that protease inhibitors have strong antimalarial properties. Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and artemether-lumefantrine have a synergistic effect in terms of improved malaria treatment outcomes, with no apparent increase in the risk of toxicity. Overall, for the prevention and treatment of malaria in HIV-infected populations, the current standard of care is similar to that in non-HIV-infected populations. The available data show that the wider use of insecticide-treated bed-nets, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy might substantially reduce the morbidity of malaria in HIV-infected patients. These observations show that those accessing care for HIV infection are now, paradoxically, well protected from malaria. These findings therefore highlight the need for confirmatory diagnosis of malaria in HIV-infected individuals receiving these interventions, and the provision of different artemisinin-based combination therapies to treat malaria only when the diagnosis is confirmed."
7686,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the clinical, virologic and immunologic consequences of planned treatment interruptions in chronically HIV-infected patients. One hundred forty-one patients with undetectable viral load for at least 6 months and CD4+ T cells count greater than 500 per microliter were recruited. Their antiretroviral therapy was stopped and clinical, analytic, virologic, and immunologic data were recorded at baseline, during discontinuation, and after restarting treatment. Viral load rebound after discontinuation in 137 (97%) patients, and was similar to prehighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) levels. A rapid decrease in CD4+ T-cell count (median, 240 cells per microliter), was observed in the first 3 months in all patients, with pronounced differences between them. After a median follow-up of 36 months, 45.5% patients were still without therapy. Factors related to a more severe decline were a prior lower CD4+ T nadir (<200 cells per microliter) before starting HAART, a greater increase (>500 cells per microliter) with it, a higher CD4+ T-cell count before interruption (>800 cells per microliter) and a higher viral load rebound after it. The increase in CD4+ T-cell counts after reinitiation was slower than the decline and only 55% of patients have regained the preinterruption levels at 12 months of follow- up. Twelve infectious events were registered. Treatment failure related to drug resistance was observed in two patients. Planned treatment interruptions may be safe in selected patients with previous CD4+ T cell nadir greater than 200 cells per microliter and pre-HAART VL less than 55.000 copies per milliliter, but should be not recommended in patients with the prognostic factors related to a rapid decline described in this study. Furthermore, there is a considerable concern about the development of drug resistance and the possibility of an incomplete immune reconstitution after the treatment interruption in some patients."
623,0.005,1.0000,"Acyclovir triphosphate is a potent inhibitor of hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase, but acyclovir treatment provides no benefit in patients with hepatitis B virus infection. This is due in part to the fact that hepatitis B virus, unlike herpes simplex virus, does not code for a viral thymidine kinase which catalyzes the initial phosphorylation of acyclovir. We synthesized 1-O-octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho (3-P)-acyclovir and found that it was highly active in reducing hepatitis B virus replication in 2.2. 15 cells, while acyclovir was inactive. The greater antiviral activity of 1-O-octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-P-acyclovir appeared to be due to liver cell metabolism of the compound to acyclovir monophosphate (K. Y. Hostetler et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 53:1815-1822, 1997). However, a closely related compound without a hydroxyl group at the sn-2 position of glycerol, 1-O-hexadecylpropanediol-3-P-acyclovir, was more active and selective in 2.2.15 cells in vitro. In this study, we treated woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus with increasing oral doses of 1-O-hexadecylpropanediol-3-P-acyclovir and assessed the response to therapy versus acyclovir or a placebo. At a dosage of 10 mg/kg of body weight twice a day, the test compound significantly inhibited viral replication in vivo, as indicated by a 95% reduction in serum woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA levels and by a 54% reduction in levels of woodchuck hepatitis virus replicative intermediates in the liver. Higher doses were somewhat less effective. In contrast, 20 mg of acyclovir/kg twice daily, a 5. 3-fold-higher molar dosage, had no demonstrable activity against woodchuck hepatitis virus. Oral 1-O-hexadecylpropanediol-3-P-acyclovir appeared to be safe and effective in chronic woodchuck hepatitis virus infection."
518,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of the current study was to determine the efficacy and safety of nevirapine combined with nelfinavir and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in patients previously exposed to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In a prospective, open-label, randomized study, 56 HIV-infected adults who had received HAART, including saquinavir hard gel capsule, ritonavir, or indinavir, were randomly assigned to receive nevirapine in addition to nelfinavir and two NRTIs. The proportion of patients who achieved an undetectable viral load (plasma HIV-RNA <200 copies/ml) at weeks 24 and 36 was significantly higher in the nevirapine group than in the control group (55% and 52% vs. 22% and 22%; p =.015 and p =.047). No differences in CD4 cell count or clinical outcome were observed. In the nevirapine group, 17% of patients discontinued treatment because of rashes. We conclude that the addition of nevirapine, when switching from one protease inhibitor-containing regimen to one containing nelfinavir, has a substantial effect on viral suppression."
9302,0.005,1.0000,"Both HCV and HIV are common in haemophiliacs previously treated with non-viral-inactivated clotting factor concentrates. Because of increased bleeding risks, little data are available on the safety of percutaneous outpatient liver biopsy (LBx) and impact of HIV coinfection in this population. This study aims at reporting our experience with percutaneous LBx in a cohort of haemophiliacs infected with HCV and describe the spectrum of disease and impact of HIV coinfection. A retrospective review of consecutive patients with haemophilia and HCV who underwent percutaneous LBx was performed. All patients were positive for HCV RNA by commercial assay and received factor concentrate prior to biopsy. A total of 29 male patients (mean age 36, 24 haemophilia A, five haemophilia B, and 44% coinfected with HIV) underwent successful outpatient percutaneous LBx without bleeding complication. Histologic activity index was 6.44 with advanced fibrosis (bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis) in 31%. When patients were stratified by HIV positive (n = 13) vs. HIV negative (n = 16), coinfected patients had higher fibrosis scores and higher proportion advanced fibrosis (54% vs. 12%; P = 0.0167) with no differences in age, demographic or other laboratory parameters. Multivariate logistic regression found that HIV positivity was independently associated with advanced fibrosis (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.17-11.8; P = 0.026). Outpatient percutaneous LBx can be safely performed in patients with haemophilia. Despite similar age, HIV coinfection was an independent predictor of advanced fibrosis. These data support the hypothesis that HIV accelerates fibrosis progression in those coinfected with HCV and highlights the importance of liver histology in this population."
3086,0.005,1.0000,"To explore demographics, clinical and medication profiles, patients' social support, and perceived health status in HIV/TB coinfected patients in Guangxi, China.We performed a cross-sectional study in the HIV clinic of the Guigang City People's Hospital (N‚Ää=‚Ää150). Health professionals conducted face-to-face interviews and collected data from patients' electronic medical records regarding patients' demographic, clinical, and medication information, as well as their social support and perceived health status. We classified all HIV/AIDS patients into HIV monoinfected and TB coinfected, at a ratio of 2:1.Compared with the HIV monoinfected, patients with HIV/TB coinfection were more likely to be older, male, less educated, unemployed, carrying health insurance, having advanced stage of HIV infection, longer history with HIV, and other opportunistic infections. Patients coinfected with TB were also more likely to hold a negative belief that their HIV treatment could prevent exacerbations, and reported significantly worse emotional/informational support, social interaction, and perceived health status. Better social support and better self-efficacy to the HIV treatment adherence was significantly associated with better perceived health status among patients with HIV and TB coinfection.Having HIV/TB coinfection was associated with poorer perceived general well-being and mental health, particularly in those undergoing TB therapy. Our findings suggest the need for mental health referrals and medication management for coinfected individuals, as well as further efforts and policies to improve coordinated care."

We aim to ascertain the seroprevalence of HSV and its coinfection with HIV and common sexually transmitted infections attending Obstetrics and Gynaecology outpatient department, RIMS. The study included 92 female patients with RTI. Diagnostic serology was done for HSV-1 and HSV-2 using group specific IgM indirect immunoassay using ELISA, HIV by 3 ELISA/Rapid/Simple (E/R/S) test of different biological antigen. Diagnosis of RTI was made on clinical grounds with appropriate laboratory investigations--microscopy, Gram stain smear etc. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed using Nugent's criteria, Syphilis by rapid plasma reagin (RPR) card test and Chlamydia trachomatis by IgG ELISA. Out of 92 sera tested for HSV, 18 (19.6%) were IgM HSV positive and 9 (9.8%) were HIV positive. Co-infection rate of HSV in HIV positive was 16.7%. None of the patients had clinical herpes genitalis, all were subclinical cases. 55.5% of HSV positives belongs to age group 21 to 30 years. Of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgM positives 3 (15%) had HIV, 4 (22.2%) bacterial vaginosis, 2 (11.1%) were RPR positive, 4 (22.2%) Chlamydia trachomatis, 3 (15%) were pregnant. 16 (88.8%) were unemployed, 14 (77.7%) had education level below 10 standard. Our study suggest that every case of RTI, be it an ulcerative or nonulcerative must be thoroughly evaluated by laboratory testing for primary subclinical genital HSV coinfection as this has profound implications on their judicious management and aversion of complications. Early diagnosis and treatment of HSV infection together with prophylaxis for recurrent HSV disease will prevent progression and spread of HIV disease."
9344,0.005,1.0000,"Nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors, including zidovudine, didanosine, and zalcitabine, remain the cornerstone of therapy against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the cause of AIDS. Although therapeutic regimens have been designed that are effective in slowing the progression of disease, therapy with these agents has not been optimized. Ultimately, therapy is destined to fail in most patients. Decisions regarding when to begin therapy and the course of action to take when failure of therapy occurs are largely in the hands of the patient's physician, and currently must be made without the support of conclusive clinical data. In addition to an understanding of the recommended dosing guidelines, proper management of AIDS therapy requires a fundamental knowledge of the disease process, the pharmacology and limitations of the agents employed against the virus, and close cooperation with the clinical laboratory. Therefore, this article reviews the pharmacology of the three drugs currently approved for treatment of HIV infection, and the current guidelines for their use. The article also reviews the clinical and laboratory management of these agents, including the use of surrogate markers and the potential for pharmacokinetic optimization of therapy."
3238,0.005,1.0000,"Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common worldwide. The current guidelines for the treatment of HIV infection recommend that HIV patients coinfected with HBV receive antiretoroviral therapy (ART) with two nucleoside analogs against HBV. However, an increase in liver enzymes that is usually attributed to HBV immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) sometimes occurs in HBV/HIV-coinfected patients after the commencement of ART. We report a case of HBV/HIV-coinfection in which the chronic hepatitis B was successfully treated using interferon (IFN) therapy followed by ART without the development of IRIS. A Japanese man in thirties was referred to our hospital because of an acute HIV infection two months after the diagnosis of an acute HBV infection, which had progressed to a chronic HBV infection. The laboratory test results were as follows:hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive, HBV DNA level of 8.8 Log copies/mL, HBV genotype A, alanine aminotransferase of 834 IU/L, HIV RNA level of 5 Log copies/mL, and a CD4+ T cell count of 437/microL. The initial treatment was natural IFNalpha therapy for chronic hepatitis B, and HBeAg seroclearance was achieved 20 weeks after the start of therapy. Four months after the end of IFN therapy for 24 weeks, ART including tenofovir and emtricitabine against HBV was commenced. Six months after starting ART, the patient's serum HBV DNA level had decreased and become undetectable and HBsAg seroclearance was achieved without an elevation in liver enzymes. The present case suggests that IFN therapy prior to ART contributes to a successful outcome for chronic hepatitis B patients coinfected with HIV, if the HIV status does not require the immediate start of ART."
3289,0.005,1.0000,"There are sparse epidemiologic data on coinfection of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) in the United States. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of HBV coinfection in a large U.S. population of HCV patients. We used the National Veterans Affairs HCV Clinical Case Registry to identify patients tested for HCV during 1997-2005. Patients were categorized based on HCV exposure (any two +HCV tests or one test with a diagnostic code), HCV infection (+RNA or genotype), HBV exposure (any +HBV test, excluding +HBsAb only), and HBV infection (+HBsAg, HBV DNA, or HBeAg). The prevalence of HBV exposure among patients with HCV exposure and that of HBV infection among patients with HCV infection were determined. Multivariate logistic regression evaluated potential demographic and clinical predictors of HBV coinfection. Among 168,239 patients with HCV exposure, 58,415 patients had HBV exposure for a prevalence of 34.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34.5-35.0). Among 102,971 patients with HCV infection, 1,431 patients had HBV coinfection for a prevalence of 1.4% (95% CI 1.3-1.5). Independent associations with HBV coinfection compared with HCV monoinfection were age ‚â§ 50 years, male sex, positive HIV status, history of hemophilia, sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, history of blood transfusion, cocaine and other drug use; there was decreased risk in patients of Hispanic ethnicity."
5141,0.005,1.0000,"Monitoring hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants periodically during nucleoside analogue treatment is of great clinical significance, particularly in persistently HBV DNA-positive patients. However, few studies have investigated the dynamic changes of HBV YMDD (Tyr-Met-Asp-Asp) and YVDD (Tyr-Val-Asp-Asp) populations in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients whilst undergoing lamivudine (LMV) treatment. In this study, we sought to investigate the dynamic changes of HBV YMDD and YVDD variants by ultrasensitive real-time amplification refractory mutation system quantitative PCR (RT-ARMS-qPCR) and evaluate its significance for changes in the treatment of CHB patients. RT-ARMS-qPCR was established and evaluated with standard recombinant plasmids. Fifteen CHB patients receiving LMV (100 mg daily) were consecutively recruited and followed up for 60 weeks. Serum samples were obtained from each patient at baseline and every 12 weeks. The total HBV DNA, HBV YMDD DNA and YVDD DNA levels were measured using RT-ARMS-qPCR at all given time points after treatment. Routine liver biochemistry parameters, including aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, were also measured every 12 weeks. The linear range of the assay was between 1√ó10(12) and 1√ó10(5) copies ml(-1). The low detection limit was 1√ó10(4) copies ml(-1). After 60 weeks of LMV treatment, nine patients experienced virological breakthrough. The YVDD variant could be detected 12-48 weeks before virological breakthrough. The YVDD variant was detected as the predominant population (range 69.4-100‚Ää%) in patients by the time virological breakthrough appeared. We concluded that RT-ARMS-qPCR was sensitive for the detection and quantification of low levels of HBV mutation. Periodic detection of HBV YM(V)DD every 12 weeks during LMV treatment is helpful for therapeutic decision making. "
1910,0.005,1.0000,"Few empirical studies have evaluated the mediating effects of quality of life (QoL) among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The purposes of this study were to identify the predictors of QoL and to test the mediating effects of social support on depression and QoL among patients enrolled in an HIV case-management program in Taiwan. A cross-sectional, descriptive correlation design collected data from 108 HIV-infected individuals. Individuals were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II, the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support between September 2007 and April 2010. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (including age, gender, and mode of transmission) and clinical information (including CD4 count and time since diagnosis with HIV), the study findings showed that QoL was significantly and positively correlated with both social support and the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and was negatively correlated with depression and time since diagnosis with HIV. The strongest predictors for QoL were depression followed by the initiation of HAART and social support, with an R(2) of 0.40. Social support partially mediated the relationship between depression and QoL. Health professionals should enhance HIV-infected individuals' social support to alleviate the level of depression and further increase the QoL among PLWHA."
2010,0.005,1.0000,"BACKGROUND In November and December 2012, 6 patients at a hemodialysis clinic were given a diagnosis of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. OBJECTIVE To investigate the outbreak to identify risk factors for transmission. METHODS A case patient was defined as a patient who was HCV-antibody negative on clinic admission but subsequently was found to be HCV-antibody positive from January 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013. Patient charts were reviewed to identify and describe case patients. The hypervariable region 1 of HCV from infected patients was tested to assess viral genetic relatedness. Infection control practices were evaluated via observations. A forensic chemiluminescent agent was used to identify blood contamination on environmental surfaces after cleaning. RESULTS Eighteen case patients were identified at the clinic from January 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013, resulting in an estimated 16.7% attack rate. Analysis of HCV quasispecies identified 4 separate clusters of transmission involving 11 case patients. The case patients and previously infected patients in each cluster were treated in neighboring dialysis stations during the same shift, or at the same dialysis station on 2 consecutive shifts. Lapses in infection control were identified. Visible and invisible blood was identified on multiple surfaces at the clinic. CONCLUSIONS Epidemiologic and laboratory data confirmed transmission of HCV among numerous patients at the dialysis clinic over 6 years. Infection control breaches were likely responsible. This outbreak highlights the importance of rigorous adherence to recommended infection control practices in dialysis settings."
3524,0.005,1.0000,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified host genetic variation to be critical for predicting treatment response and spontaneous clearance in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). These important new studies are reviewed and their future clinical implications discussed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the region of the IL28B gene on chromosome 19, coding for the interferon (IFN)-Œª-3 or IL28B gene, are strongly associated with treatment response to pegylated IFN and ribavirin in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. The good response variant is associated with a twofold increase in the rate of cure. Allele frequencies differ between ethnic groups, largely explaining the observed differences in response rates between Caucasians, African Americans and Asians. IL28B polymorphism is also strongly associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV. The biological mechanisms responsible for these genetic associations remain unknown and are the focus of ongoing research. Knowledge of a patient's IL28B genotype is likely to aid in clinical decision making with standard of care regimens. Future studies will investigate the possibility of individualizing treatment duration and novel regimens according to IL28B type."
1306,0.005,1.0000,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a lentivirus associated with AIDS-like illnesses in cats. As such, FIV appears to be a feline analog of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A hallmark of HIV infection is the large degree of viral genetic diversity that can develop within an infected individual and the even greater and continually increasing level of diversity among virus isolates from different individuals. Our goal in this study was to determine patterns of FIV genetic diversity by focusing on a 684-nucleotide region encompassing variable regions V3, V4, and V5 of the FIV env gene in order to establish parallels and distinctions between FIV and HIV type 1 (HIV-1). Our data demonstrate that, like HIV-1, FIV can be separated into distinct envelope sequence subtypes (three are described here). Similar to that found for HIV-1, the pairwise sequence divergence within an FIV subtype ranged from 2.5 to 15.0%, whereas that between subtypes ranged from 17.8 to 26.2%. However, the high number of synonymous nucleotide changes among FIV V3 to V5 env sequences may also include a significant number of back mutations and suggests that the evolutionary distances among FIV subtypes are underestimated. Although only a few subtype B viruses were available for examination, the pattern of diversity between the FIV A and B subtypes was found to be significantly distinct; subtype B sequences had proportionally fewer mutations that changed amino acids, compared with silent changes, suggesting a more advanced state of adaptation to the host. No similar distinction was evident for HIV-1 subtypes. The diversity of FIV genomes within individual infected cats was found to be as high as 3.7% yet twofold lower than that within HIV-1-infected people over a comparable region of the env gene. Despite these differences, significant parallels between patterns of FIV evolution and HIV-1 evolution exist, indicating that a wide array of potentially divergent virus challenges need to be considered in FIV vaccine and pathogenesis studies."

In ongoing efforts to alleviate this crisis, the national government has placed great emphasis on efforts in Henan province where HIV-infected former plasma donors in the 1990s contributed to AIDS becoming a public health crisis. Concomitant with a national initiative focusing the use of pharmacogenetics for the better prediction of treatment response, we studied genetic variants with known pharmacokinetic phenotypes in a set of 298 HAART-treated (highly active antiretroviral therapy) patients infected with HIV from the Henan cohort. We measured the association of response to treatment, assessed as changes in CD4+ T cell counts after antiretroviral therapy, of five polymorphisms in four genes (CYP2B6, ABCB1/MDR1, ABCG2, and ABCC4) in which variation has been suggested to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs commonly employed to treat HIV/AIDS. We show that genotyping for ABCB1 variations (rs1045642 and rs2032582) may help predict HIV treatment response. We found variations in this gene have a significant association with outcome as measured by CD4+ T cell counts in a discovery subset (N= 197; odds ratio (OR) = 1.58; 95% CI 1.02-2.45), these results were confirmed in a validation subset of the cohort (N = 78; OR= 2.81; 95% CI 1.32-5.96). Exploratory analysis suggests that this effect may be specific to NVP (nevirapine) or 3TC (lamivudine) response. This publication represents the first genetic analysis in a continuing effort to study and assist the patients in a very large, unique, and historically significant HIV-AIDS cohort. Genotyping of AIDS patients for ABCB1 variation may help predict outcome and potentially could help guide treatment strategies."
8906,0.005,1.0000,"It has been estimated that, to date, about 48% of all HIV-infected people in the world carry HIV-1 subtype C virus. Therefore, it is of great importance to gain better knowledge about the genetic and biological characteristics of this virus subtype. In the present study, the biological properties of HIV-1 isolates obtained from nine Ethiopian patients with AIDS were studied. DNA sequencing of the V3 loop of gp120 classified the isolates as subtype C. In primary isolation cultures, virus infection was accompanied by syncytium formation and cell lysis. Interestingly, when examining the growth in primary monocyte-macrophage cultures, initial low-level virus replication was followed by a nonproductive state, from which virus could be rescued by cocultivation with Jurkat(tat) cells. Furthermore, none of the isolates replicated in T cell lines (CEM, MT-2, HuT-78, and H9) or in the promonocytic cell line U937 clone 2. All isolates could use CCR5 as coreceptor, whereas no isolates could use CCR2b, CCR3, CCR5, CXCR4, Bonzo/STRL33, or BOB/GPR15. The genotype of the V3 region correlated with the MT-2 negative/non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) phenotype. Comparative studies revealed that the scarcity of CXCR4 usage as well as other phenotypic characteristics of subtype C isolates distinguish this subtype. On the basis of these data, we suggest that in addition, factors other than viral phenotype may govern the pathogenic potential of subtype C isolates."
3498,0.005,1.0000,"Intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in Seattle (n = 213) were studied to identify the prevalence and predominant types of and risk factors for human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection. Detailed questionnaires, serologic screening, and polymerase chain reaction analysis (for a subset) were used. Evidence of HTLV infection was found in 16.5%, of which 89% were HTLV-II. HTLV infection was significantly associated with nonwhite race, older age, more years of intravenous drug use, prior use of heroin, history of gonorrhea, history of any sexually transmitted disease, hepatitis B virus infection, and antibody to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). By stepwise logistic regression analysis, associations persisted with race, age, hepatitis B markers, and HSV-2. Thus, the strong association of HTLV with hepatitis B, a marker for injection behavior, and the independent association with HSV-2 infection, a sexually transmitted pathogen, suggest similarities in the epidemiology of HTLV and human immunodeficiency virus infections in IVDUs."
7747,0.005,1.0000,"An evolving dominance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C (HIV-1C) in the AIDS epidemic has been associated with a high prevalence of HIV-1C infection in the southern African countries and with an expanding epidemic in India and China. Understanding the molecular phylogeny and genetic diversity of HIV-1C viruses may be important for the design and evaluation of an HIV vaccine for ultimate use in the developing world. In this study we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships (i) between 73 non-recombinant HIV-1C near-full-length genome sequences, including 51 isolates from Botswana; (ii) between HIV-1C consensus sequences that represent different geographic subsets; and (iii) between specific isolates and consensus sequences. Based on the phylogenetic analyses of 73 near-full-length genomes, 16 ""lineages"" (a term that is used hereafter for discussion purposes and does not imply taxonomic standing) were identified within HIV-1C. The lineages were supported by high bootstrap values in maximum-parsimony and neighbor-joining analyses and were confirmed by the maximum-likelihood method. The nucleotide diversity between the 73 HIV-1C isolates (mean value of 8.93%; range, 2.9 to 11.7%) was significantly higher than the diversity of the samples to the consensus sequence (mean value of 4.86%; range, 3.3 to 7.2%, P < 0.0001). The translated amino acid distances to the consensus sequence were significantly lower than distances between samples within all HIV-1C proteins. The consensus sequences of HIV-1C proteins accompanied by amino acid frequencies were presented (that of Gag is presented in this work; those of Pol, Vif, Vpr, Tat, Rev, Vpu, Env, and Nef are presented elsewhere [http://www.aids.harvard.edu/lab_research/concensus_sequence.htm]). Additionally, in the promoter region three NF-kappa B sites (GGGRNNYYCC) were identified within the consensus sequences of the entire set or any subset of HIV-1C isolates. This study suggests that the consensus sequence approach could overcome the high genetic diversity of HIV-1C and facilitate an AIDS vaccine design, particularly if the assumption that an HIV-1C antigen with a more extensive match to the circulating viruses is likely to be more efficacious is proven in efficacy trials."

The prevalence of HIV, HBsAg, syphilis, Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) were 17.0%, 7.7%, 11.3%, 18.2% and 13.2%, respectively. In the three different anatomic sites (urethra, rectum and pharynx), the prevalence of rectal CT was the highest (15.5%), whereas NG was most commonly found in the pharynx (8.1%). Low education level, homosexuality, inconsistent condom use and drug use in the previous six months were significantly associated with HIV infection, whereas the former three factors were also associated with HBV infection.Older people (aged‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ40 years) and those who lacked knowledge of STIs, and younger people (aged <30 years) as well as inconsistent condom users were more at risk of syphilis and CT infections, respectively. NG infection was only associated with reported dating venues. Our study revealed a heavy disease burden and multiple risk factors of HIV/STIs among MSM in Kunming. It is necessary to promote regular screening and proactive treatment of HIV/STIs among MSM."

At least one gene was found in 52 (16.5%) samples, 50 (19.6%) from hospitals and 2 (3%) from schools. The AA probe was found in 36 (69%), the aggR gene was found in 41 (79%), and the aap gene was found in 49 (94%) of all positive samples. EAEC was significantly associated with diarrhea and intestinal inflammation and was significantly higher (chi(2) = 5.360, P = 0.021) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive persons (29.5%) than in HIV-negative persons (13.7%). The presence of EAEC genes was significantly associated with occult blood (chi(2) = 30.543, P < 0.0001) in the stool samples. This study suggests that the clinical presentation of EAEC infection may be directly related to the bacterial load as well as to the genetic characteristics of the strains involved."

5173,0.005,1.0000,"We performed a population-based cohort study to assess the impact of nonwhite origin on the outcome of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for a Danish cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. A total of 389 whites and 135 nonwhites started receiving HAART before 1 April 2001. After 1 year of treatment, 78% of nonwhites and 76% of whites achieved a virus load of <500 HIV RNA copies/mL. No major differences were found between the 2 groups with respect to achievement of a virus load of <500 copies/mL (relative risk [RR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-1.18), risk of clinical progression (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.32-1.24), or response measured by total CD4+ cell count. One year after fulfilling Danish recommendations for initiation of HAART, 91% of nonwhites and 93% of whites had started receiving HAART. Race and ethnic origin play no major role in the outcome associated with HAART if access to health care is free."

8892,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-infected patients who are on hemodialysis have a worse prognosis than noninfected patients who are on hemodialysis. Their outcome in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era remains unclear. Outcomes in patients who were enrolled in the French Dialysis in HIV/AIDS (DIVA) cohort were determined in a 2-yr prospective follow-up. All HIV-infected patients who were on hemodialysis in France on January 1, 2002, were included and followed prospectively until January 1, 2004. Patients' survival was examined by Kaplan-Meier method, and mortality risk factors were examined using uni- and multicovariate analyses. Survival was compared with that of 584 hemodialysis patients who did not have HIV or diabetes and were enrolled in the French Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study II (DOPPS II) in the same period (after standardization for the average age, gender, and ethnicity of the DIVA cohort). A total of 27,577 patients were receiving hemodialysis in France at the beginning of the study; 164 (0.59%) were infected with HIV, 72% were male, mean age was 44.8 +/- 10.9 yr, and 65% were black. The 2-yr survival rate was 89 +/- 2% and statistically indistinguishable from the survival of the French cohort extracted from the DOPPS II study. Significant mortality risk factors were low CD4 cell count (hazard ratio [HR] 1.4/100 CD4 cells per mm(3) lower), high viral load (HR 2.5/1 Log per ml), absence of HAART (HR 2.7), and a history of opportunistic infection (HR 3.7), the last two being independent (HR 2.6 and 3.6, respectively). Survival of HIV-infected patients who are hemodialysis has greatly improved. A prospective cohort of paired hemodialysis patients with and without HIV is required to compare better their mortality in the HAART era."
5568,0.005,1.0000,"Initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with low CD4 counts or AIDS-defining illnesses (ADIs) increases risk of treatment failure and death. We examined factors associated with late initiation among 18- to 29-year-olds within the Canadian Observational Cohort (CANOC) collaboration, a multi-site study of HIV-positive persons who initiated HAART after 2000. Late initiation was defined as beginning HAART with a CD4 count <200 cells/mm(3) and/or having a baseline ADI. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent correlates of late initiation. In total, 1026 individuals (422 from British Columbia, 400 from Ontario, and 204 from Quebec) met our age criteria. At HAART initiation, median age was 27 years (interquartile range, 24, 28 years). A total of 412 individuals (40%) identified as late initiators. Late initiation was associated with female gender, age >25 years at initiation, initiating treatment in earlier years, and having higher baseline viral load. The high number of young adults in our cohort starting HAART late indicates important target populations for specialized services, increased testing, and linkages to care. "
5958,0.005,1.0000,"The prognostic role of GB virus type C (GBV-C) viraemia in HIV-infected subjects treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is still undefined. The aim of this analysis is to assess the relationship between GBV-C infection and response to antiretroviral therapy among HIV-infected subjects initiating HAART when antiretroviral-naive. A prospective, observational study of 400 HIV-infected patients with measurements of GBV-C RNA, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies and HCV RNA determined from plasma stored prior to HAART initiation. Time to virological (achieving HIV RNA < or =500 copies/ml) and immunological success (a CD4+ count increase of > or =200 cells/microl), and the time to virological relapse (confirmed HIV RNA >500 copies/ml) were assessed by Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazard regression model. Of the subjects, 117 (29.3%) were GBV-C positive and, overall, 351 (87.8%) patients achieved virological success. After controlling for a number of confounders including HCV RNA, GBV-C viraemic patients experienced a significantly lower risk of HIV rebound than those who were GBV-C negative [relative hazard (RH)=0.56, 95% CI: 0.34-0.93, P=0.03]. Conversely, the probability of achieving initial virological success or CD4+ count response after HAART did not differ between GBV-C-negative and -positive subjects. These results suggest that GBV-C coinfection may play a role in determining the rate of HIV rebound possibly by competing with HIV replication after HIV load has been successfully suppressed by HAART."
8726,0.005,1.0000,"We report the first study on prevalence of antiretroviral drug-associated resistance mutations in Venezuela. Protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding regions were analyzed in DNA samples obtained from 100 HIV-1-infected individuals. Primary resistance mutations to RT inhibitors were identified in 26% of patients treated with these drugs. Transmission of HIV-1-resistant strains was detected in a drug-naive patient (3%). Primary resistance mutations to protease inhibitors (PIs) were present in 9% of the 44 PI-treated patients and in 1 PI-naive individual. Phylogenetic analysis of these samples has resulted in the most extensive survey, to date, of HIV-1 genetic forms circulating in Venezuela. Ninety-nine samples clustered with subtype B, and 1 individual harbored the first B/F recombinant virus reported in Venezuela, with protease clustering with subtype F and RT with subtype B. In addition, this isolate had a new insertion (Glu-34 duplication) in the protease gene."
311,0.005,1.0000,"Atazanavir is the first once-daily protease inhibitor for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection and should be used only in combination therapy, as part of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. In addition to being the most potent protease inhibitor in vitro, atazanavir has a distinct cross-resistance profile that does not confer resistance to other protease inhibitors. However, resistance to other protease inhibitors often confers clinically relevant resistance to atazanavir. Currently, atazanavir is not a preferred protease inhibitor for initial HAART regimens. In treatment-naive patients, atazanavir can be given as 400 mg/day. However, atazanavir should be pharmacologically boosted with ritonavir in treatment-experienced patients or when coadministered with either tenofovir or efavirenz. Patients who receive atazanavir experience similar rates of adverse events compared with patients receiving comparator regimens. An exception is an increased risk of asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia, which is due to competitive inhibition of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. Although hyperbilirubinemia is a common adverse drug reaction of atazanavir therapy (22-47%), fewer than 2% of patients discontinue atazanavir therapy because of this adverse effect. Common adverse effects reported with atazanavir include infection, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, peripheral neuropathy, and rash. Of significance, fewer abnormalities have been observed in plasma lipid profiles in patients treated with atazanavir compared with other protease inhibitor-containing regimens. As with other protease inhibitors, atazanavir is also a substrate and moderate inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, in particular CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Clinically significant drug interactions include (but are not limited to) antacids, proton pump inhibitors, histamine type 2 receptor antagonists, tenofovir, diltiazem, irinotecan, simvastatin, lovastatin, St. John's wort, and warfarin. We conclude that atazanavir is a distinctively characteristic protease inhibitor owing to its in vitro potency, once-daily dosing, distinct initial resistance pattern, and infrequent association with metabolic abnormalities."
8408,0.005,1.0000,"Bone mineral density (BMD) abnormalities are observed frequently among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Risk factors for reduced BMD in the setting of HIV have been previously studied, but detailed antiretroviral treatment history is often not available. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted between 2005 and 2007 among unselected HIV-infected adults attending an ambulatory urban HIV clinic. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans of lumbar spine and femoral neck, full laboratory profile, detailed questionnaire, and antiretroviral history were obtained. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate factors associated with BMD below the expected range for age. Two hundred ninety patients completed the study: 80% Caucasians, 89% males, with median age of 49 yr. Low BMD as assessed by Z-score was present in 19.7% of the patients. By multivariate analysis, only lower body mass index (BMI) was an independent risk factor for low BMD. Cumulative exposure to protease inhibitors, non-nucleosides, and individual nucleoside and nucleotide analogs were not independently associated with low BMD. In conclusion, a 19.7% prevalence of abnormal BMD by DXA scan was identified in an unselected group of HIV-infected adults. Lower BMI was independently associated with low BMD. No correlation was found between abnormal BMD and cumulative exposure to any antiretroviral agents."
1510,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) production continues in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with undetectable (<50 copies/mL) virus loads. Our initial cross-sectional study showed that this viremia is composed of viruses that lack new resistance mutations to the HAART regimen. Here we describe a longitudinal, clonal genotypic analysis of plasma virus loads in treated adults who had undetectable virus loads. We document a continuous production of virus in 8 HIV-1-infected adults who maintained suppression of viremia for up to 15 months. Using analytical approaches for distinguishing selected resistance mutations from nonselected mutations and polymerase chain reaction errors, we detected no evolution of resistance in the reverse-transcriptase and protease genes. Sporadic resistance mutations were detected in some viral clones that were not selected for subsequently. Thus, in some patients, HAART suppresses replication to a level that does not allow the evolution of drug resistance over a time frame of years."
551,0.005,1.0000,"Transmission of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains has been gaining attention and is becoming a growing problem throughout the world. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) among antiretroviral (ARV)-naive HIV-infected pregnant women in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ARV-naive pregnant women were recruited at Hospital Geral de Nova Iguacu (HGNI), Rio de Janeiro, from 2005 to 2008. HIV genotyping was carried out using ViroSeq (Abbott v. 2.0). TDRM were detected using the Calibrated Population Resistance Tool-CPR v. 6.0.The prevalence of mutations associated with resistance in the protease and reverse transcriptase regions of the HIV genome were assessed in samples collected prior to initiation of ARV prophylaxis or treatment. Among 238 eligible specimens that were collected, 197 samples were successfully amplified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Eighty-one percent of women were infected with HIV subtype B, 10% with subtype F1 viruses, 1.0% with subtype C virus, and 8.0% with recombinant forms of the virus. The prevalence of HIV TDRM was 5.6% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 2.0% for nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and 3.0% for protease inhibitors. The overall prevalence of any drug resistance was 10.7%. There were no multiclass resistant strains identified in the analyzed samples. The prevalence of HIV TDRM among the pregnant women in our cohort was moderate. Resistance testing should be encouraged in Rio de Janeiro, among other locations, for all HIV-infected pregnant women prior to prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV."
1398,0.005,1.0000,"Seven AIDS patients who were receiving suppressive therapy for previously diagnosed cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis were offered treatment with protease inhibitors (PIs). Secondary prophylaxis for CMV was discontinued after 3 months of therapy with PIs if patients had >150 CD4 cells/mm3 and a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) load of <200 copies/mL and if they were negative for CMV as determined by qualitative CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ophthalmologic exams were done periodically. After a median follow-up of 9 months (range, 9-12), no new episodes of CMV retinitis were observed. CD4 cell counts were >150 cells/mm3 in all cases, HIV loads were <200 copies/mL, and results for qualitative CMV PCRs remained negative. These observations suggest that for selected patients with healed CMV retinitis who have immunologic and virologic evidence of a clinical response to potent combination antiretroviral therapy, temporary discontinuation of a chronic anti-CMV suppressive therapy may not result in further retinal necrosis. However, the long-term immunologic benefit of PIs and hence the safety of prolonged withdrawal of anti-CMV therapy is unknown."
7560,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to identify parameters among saquinavir pharmacokinetics, patients' demographics or comedications, to be addressed for improved personalized therapy. The presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA at therapy week 48 (principal target parameter), CD4 cell count at week 48, infections and side effects during 48 weeks, indicators of liver toxicity and lipid abnormalities at week 48, and a 12-h saquinavir plasma concentration-versus-time profile were assessed in 56 patients receiving saquinavir-ritonavir (1,000 and 100 mg, respectively) twice daily (44 therapy-na√Øve and 12 antiretrovirally pretreated patients) for association with saquinavir plasma concentrations, demographics, baseline values of target parameters, and coadministered antiretrovirals. Antiretroviral failure was observed in 8 of the 56 patients in whom HIV-1 RNA was detectable at week 48. This therapeutic failure was not associated with individual saquinavir pharmacokinetics. More likely, therapeutic failure was related to incidences interfering with antiretroviral therapy, causing therapy interruptions or incompliance. Weak associations were, however, seen between high maximum saquinavir plasma concentrations and both CD4 counts of > or =200 cells microl(-1) at week 48 (P = 0.014) and constitutional side effects during 48 weeks (P = 0.002). However, patients with high CD4 counts and constitutional side effects were not identical (P = 0.53). Saquinavir therapeutic drug monitoring in patients infected with protease inhibitor-susceptible HIV-1 taking saquinavir-ritonavir (1,000 and 100 mg, respectively) is not demanded for improving the antiretroviral effect. It may be contemplated in cases with constitutional side effects or low CD4 counts with weak immune responses."
4089,0.005,1.0000,"In transient gene expression assays we observed an increase in expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) gene, under the transcriptional control of the HIV-1 LTR (pLTR-CAT), when this plasmid was cotransfected into Vero or MRC-5 cells with a plasmid containing either the HCMV immediate early 1 and 2 (E1, IE2) genes (pRL43a) or just the IE2 gene (pMP18). When the HCMV IE1 gene (pMP12) was cotransfected with pLTR-CAT into Vero cells the level of measurable CAT gene activity was below the level observed when pLTR-CAT was cotransfected with a nonspecific carrier plasmid (pGEM3). The negative influence of the HCMV IE1 gene product on the HIV-1 LTR in Vero cells was also observed when the HIV-1 tat gene (pLTR-TAT) was contransfected into Vero cells with pLTR-CAT and pMP12. However, when the HCMV IE1 gene was cotransfected into rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells with proviral HIV-1 DNA, an increase in viral production, as monitored by measurement of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity, was observed. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, nuclear extracts obtained 15 hr post-HCMV infection (hpi) were found to contain a lower level of interaction with an oligonucleotide which corresponded to the HIV-1 LTR Sp-1 binding motif. Nuclear extracts obtained 40 hpi of MRC-5 cells had a greater level of interaction with, and changed the mobility of, the Sp-1 oligonucleotide relative to the uninfected nuclear extracts. HCMV-infected MRC-5 cell nuclear extracts also contain a factor(s) which interacted with the HIV-1 LTR between nucleotide positions -15 to -2 relative to the HIV-1 mRNA start site."
2883,0.005,1.0000,"Oligonucleotide compounds composed of only deoxyguanosine and deoxythymidine were able to significantly inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type -1 (HIV-1)-induced syncytium formation and virus production (as measured by p24 core antigen expression) in an acute infection assay system. The oligonucleotides did not share any homology with or possess any complementary (antisense) sequence motifs to the HIV-1 genome. The guanosine/thymidine-containing oligonucleotides (GTOs) that showed this anti-HIV activity contained natural phosphodiester (PD) linkages (backbones) between the nucleosides. One of the PD oligonucleotide sequence motifs tested was capable of inhibiting HIV-1-induced syncytium formation and p24 production with a median effective dose in culture (ED50) in the submicromolar range. In addition, oligonucleotides tested were able to significantly suppress HIV-1 p24 levels > or = 7 days after removal of the drug from the infected cell culture medium. The growth inhibition properties (toxicity) of this genre of oligonucleotides was determined to be well above the ED50 values yielding high selective indexes. In vitro results showed that GTOs with PD backbones were potent competitive inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. These same molecules were capable of blocking the interaction between gp120 and CD4. All measured activities of these molecules were increased by factors of 10-500 when the PD backbone was replaced with a PT backbone in a sequence-dependent manner. The enhanced antiviral activity displayed by the sulfur group on the oligonucleotide backbone and the lack of any sequence-specific interactions suggest that a percentage of antiviral activity of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics is due to mechanisms other than those originally postulated for oligonucleotides. The good selective index of GTOs coupled with the prolonged suppression of HIV-1 in culture after removal of oligonucleotides from the infected cell culture make this a class of compounds that warrant investigation as therapeutic agents to be used against HIV-1."
9447,0.005,1.0000,"Enteroparasites are related to gastrointestinal alterations among patients with HIV/AIDS, some causing severe manifestations in the period before the institution of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The prevalence of enteroparasitoses in patients with HIV/AIDS seen at two hospitals in Cear√° , Brazil, was compared in the pre-HAART (Group 1; n = 482) and HAART (Group 2; n = 100) eras. Fecal parasitologic examinations (FPE) were performed using the direct, Lutz, Baermann-Moraes and modified Ziehl-Neelsen methods. The following parasites were detected in Groups 1 and 2, respectively: Strongyloides stercoralis--30.1% and 11% (p<0.0001), Ascaris lumbricoides--15.6% and 2% (p<0.0001), hookworms--3.7% and 2% (p<0.0001), Trichuris trichiura--13.1% and 1% (p<0.0001), Hymenolepis nana--0 and 1% (p = 0.1718), Giardia duodenalis--7.9% and 1% (p = 0.0076), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar--3.3% and 1% (p = 0.3301), Isospora belli--4.8% and 1% (p = 0.0993), Cryptosporidium sp.--8.1% and 0 (p = 0.0007), and non-pathogenic protozoans as well. There was a significant reduction in the prevalence of enteroparasites between the eras (63.9% to 24%; p<0.0001). In the HAART era, the following observations were made: greater frequency of enteroparasites in patients without antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.0575), as in those with AIDS (p = 0.08), and diarrhea (36% of the patients); lack of association with positive FPE (p = 0.626); and non-detection of Cryptosporidium sp. Strongyloides stercoralis showed an elevated prevalence in the two eras and was more frequent in men (32.41%) than women (19.04%) of Group 1 (p = 0.018), a finding suggesting the transmission of the helminth through sodomy. The advent of the HAART modified the profile of opportunistic infections, including parasites, probably due to the reconstitution of cellular immunity and the direct action of HAART on the parasites."
519,0.005,1.0000,"Despite continued progress in the development of novel antiretroviral therapies, it has become increasingly evident that drug-based treatments will not lead to a functional or sterilizing cure for HIV(+) patients. In 2009, an HIV(+) patient was effectively cured of HIV following allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a CCR5(-/-) donor. The utility of this approach, however, is severely limited because of the difficulty in finding matched donors. Hence, we studied the potential of HIV-resistant stem cells in the autologous setting in a nonhuman primate AIDS model and incorporated a fusion inhibitor (mC46) as the means for developing infection-resistant cells. Pigtail macaques underwent identical transplants and Simian-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (SHIV) challenge procedures with the only variation between control and mC46 macaques being the inclusion of a fusion-inhibitor expression cassette. Following SHIV challenge, mC46 macaques, but not control macaques, showed a positive selection of gene-modified CD4(+) T cells in peripheral blood, gastrointestinal tract, and lymph nodes, accounting for >90% of the total CD4(+) T-cell population. mC46 macaques also maintained high frequencies of SHIV-specific, gene-modified CD4(+) T cells, an increase in nonmodified CD4(+) T cells, enhanced cytotoxic T lymphocyte function, and antibody responses. These data suggest that HSC protection may be a potential alternative to conventional antiretroviral therapy in patients with HIV/AIDS. "
9681,0.005,1.0000,"With the rapid progress in the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the observed patterns in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalitis has changed, allowing herpesvirus (HV) infection to be controlled. HAART was first administered to HIV patients in Cuba in 2001. Consequently with the aim of investigate the behavior of the HVs causing neurological disorders in this population in the post-HAART era, the authors perform a clinical evaluation by a multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for simultaneous detection of human HVs--herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The authors studied 241 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) received at the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Laboratory between 2001 and 2005 inclusive. Of the 241 CSF studied, 10.4% resulted positive for HV infections. Of these, 92% of patients were acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) individuals at the C3 stage. CMV (44%), EBV (28%), and dual-HV (16%) infections were the most important agents identified. The principal clinical manifestations were fever, headache, vomiting, and focal abnormalities; the latter being associated with an increased risk of death. A statistically significant result was observed when central nervous system (CNS) disease evolution was compared between patients who were under HAART against those who were not, before they developed encephalitis. It was therefore concluded that it is more likely that HIV individuals receiving HAART have a better recovery of CNS infections than those who are not receiving it."
9482,0.005,1.0000,"In the past few years there has been increasing concern about the transmission of drug-resistant HIV. This study aimed to describe the frequency of primary mutations associated with HIV-1 drug resistance and the prevalence of genetic HIV subtypes in a population of vertically infected children before the initiation of HAART. At the time of genotypic testing, the median age was 6.0 years (IQR 25-75%: 3.8-9.2) and the median age at admission was 3.84 years (IQR 25-75%: 1.23-6.11). Antepartum maternal ARV exposure for PMTCT occurred for three (7.3%) mothers. According to the WHO criteria, primary ARV resistance mutations were detected in four out of 41 (9.8%) children. Subtype B was the most prevalent (63.4%). The relatively high prevalence of primary HIV-1 DRMs in this cohort of perinatally infected children in Brazil supports the local recommendation to perform resistance testing in all newly diagnosed children, regardless of age at diagnosis and antenatal ARV exposure."
8696,0.005,1.0000,"In advanced HIV infection, the homeostatic balance between gastrointestinal indigenous bacteria and gut immunity fails and microbes are able to overcome the intestinal barrier and gain the systemic circulation. Because microbial translocation is not fully controlled by antiviral therapy and is associated with inefficient CD4+ reconstitution, we investigated the profile of translocating bacteria in peripheral blood of 44 HIV-infected patients starting therapy with advanced CD4+ T-lymphopenia and displaying poor CD4+ recovery on virologically suppressive HAART. According to CD4+ reconstitution at 12-months HAART, patients were considered Partial Immunological Responders, PIRs (CD4+‚â•250/¬µl, n‚Ää=‚Ää29) and Immunological non Responders, INRs (CD4+<200/¬µl, n‚Ää=‚Ää15)). We show that PIRs and INRs present similarly elevated plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its ligand sCD14 that were not lowered by virologically suppressive therapy. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing resulted in a highly polymicrobic peripheral blood microbiota both prior and after 12-month HAART. Several differences in bacterial composition were shown between patients' groups, mainly the lack of probiotic Lactobacillaceae both prior and after therapy in INRs. Failure to control microbial translocation on HAART is associated with a polymicrobic flora circulating in peripheral blood that is not substantially modified by therapy."
8607,0.005,1.0000,"A specific 32-nucleotide deletion mutant of the CCR5 gene (Accr5), the coreceptor gene for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), can effectively suppress the transmission and pathogenesis of the virus. Individuals homozygous for the delta ccr5 allele resist primary macrophage-tropic HIV-1 infection, despite multiple high-risk sexual exposures. This gene deletion is relatively common among Caucasians but uncommon among Africans, Asians, and South Americans. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to determine the frequency of the delta ccr5 allele in a Taiwanese population with diverse health status and social backgrounds. Subjects included 24 HIV-1-infected persons in the northern and southern parts of Taiwan; 131 HIV-1 high-risk, licensed female sex workers in the northern part of the island (21% of whom were aborigines); and 187 unrelated, healthy, HIV-1-negative individuals in southern Taiwan. PCR with primers encompassing the entire CCR5 gene was used to explore possible deletions at regions other than the 32-nucleotide area in the female sex workers. No ccr5 deletions were detected, indicating that they are rare or absent in the Taiwanese population. This finding implies that delta ccr5 is not likely to be part of the defense against the spread of HIV-1-infection in Taiwanese."
2606,0.005,1.0000,"To obtain insight into the factors involved in vertical transmission, we compared the sequence diversity, seroreactivity, and biological characteristics of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) derived from a transmitter and nontransmitter mother pair. Forty-two clones from the transmitter and 20 from the nontransmitter, spanning the principal neutralization determinant (PND) of the env gene, were sequenced and analyzed. The intrapatient sequence variation in transmitter and nontransmitter viruses was 12% and 36%, respectively, and the interpatient variation was 38%. In an effort to correlate immune responses to viral genetics, we analyzed the sera from these patients against a number of V3 peptides from known HIV-1 isolates. We observed that (i) both the transmitter and nontransmitter sera demonstrated higher binding to V3 peptides based on SF-2 and MN sequences than to IIIB and Z6 isolates; (ii) the vertical transmission of HIV-1 is correlated with the absence of high maternal antibody responses to the PND; and (iii) the high-affinity binding of the sera to SF-2 and MN V3 peptides correlated with the sequence analysis, indicating that the V3 sequences from both patients are more closely related to ADA, SF-162, and MN than to IIIB or Z6. Biological analysis of the viruses from these patients demonstrate that the transmitters' viruses infect a number of T-cell lines in vitro, whereas the nontransmitter viruses do not infect cell lines or the primary lymphocytes."
2321,0.005,1.0000,"Pediatric HIV-1 infection presents remarkable features that are distinct from those observed in adult infection. In vertically HIV-1-infected children, the viral load declines more slowly, and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response emerges late, only after the sixth month of life. This response generally tends to be narrow and less intense than that seen in adults. While the nuances of immune response at the cellular level during pediatric HIV-1 infection have been addressed, there is a lack of studies focusing on the consequences of this delayed and narrowed immune response at the population level. To better explore these features, we evaluated the selection regimen in gag, pol and env gene fragments of HIV-1 during pediatric infection. We estimated the number of nonsynonymous substitutions (d(N)) and synonymous substitutions (d(S)) codon-by-codon, using the maximum likelihood method and a modified counting method. Notably, both methods indicated a similar intensity of selection (measure by mean d(N)/d(S) ratio) between children and adults. Additionally, sites under positive selection were equally distributed along HIV genes and the location of these sites was analogous between children and adults. Therefore, the selective regimen in HIV during pediatric infection is equally broad and intense likewise the observed in adults. Unexpectedly, our phylogenetic-based analysis enabled us to identify two regions in the env gene of HIV with distinct adaptive functions. The first region, located in the vicinity of V3 loop, contains sites that might increase viral fitness within-host during antibody attack and virus-cell interaction. The second region, restricted to amino acids 334-368 of Gp160, contains sites that might increase viral fitness during interhost transmission at the population level."
8350,0.005,1.0000,"Virologic failure, or the inability to maintain or achieve viral suppression below detectable limits (<50 copies/mL), occurs in some patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, despite being on a potent antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. Current guidelines state that the goal of therapy is to achieve and maintain HIV-1 RNA below detectable levels, with recommendations to switch regimens upon virologic failure based on the adverse consequences of higher degrees of viremia. With the introduction of potent, newer agents, the likelihood of achieving this goal in treatment-experienced patients is growing. Not all patients who experience virologic failure while on therapy suffer from immediate virologic and immunologic decline; some experience persistently low, but detectable, levels of HIV-1 RNA in the range of 50-1000 copies/mL. The threshold at which low-level viremia (LLV) becomes predictive of disease progression varies between studies, although evidence shows that incomplete viral suppression leads to the accumulation of resistance mutations with a concomitant increase in viral replication, reduction in CD4 cell counts, increased risk of virologic progression, and clinical deterioration. Furthermore, with increasing resistance, future treatment options are compromised. Although there are clinical consequences when a patient is maintained on a failing regimen, it may be preferable to delay a switch in therapy if the chance for resuppression is low. With the introduction of new ARVs within existing classes that have shown significant activity against resistant virus, as well as the introduction of two new classes of ARV agents, HIV treatment has entered a new era. The options for constructing regimens active against multidrug-resistant virus have expanded."
6077,0.005,1.0000,"The number of HIV-1-infected patients harboring multidrug-resistant viruses is increasing. Since new antiretroviral drugs with favorable resistance profiles are limited, innovative strategies are urgently needed. Treatment interruptions can lead to a loss in HIV resistance followed by improved response to reinitiated therapy. The authors report the case of a patient with sustained antiretroviral response for 3.5 years after a 7-month treatment interruption. Concomitant with an increase in replication capacity, multidrug-resistant viruses gradually disappeared during treatment interruption. Resistance to protease inhibitors (PI) was completely lost, and resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors was still present when therapy was reinitiated. PI-resistant variants were not detected at four time points after treatment reinitiation. The alignment of the nucleic acid sequences from all different time points suggested that the viruses obtained after treatment reinitiation evolved from less-resistant variants prior to treatment interruption. This was supported by in vitro propagation of the viral plasma population and an individual clone derived from the time point of treatment interruption. This is consistent with a model favoring reversible binding of HIV-1 to reservoirs, as has recently been proposed for follicular dendritic cells. Understanding of this process could help to exploit the reduced fitness of drug-resistant viruses for treatment interruptions."
2155,0.005,1.0000,"Protease inhibitor (PI)-resistant HIV-1 has hardly ever been detected at failed boosted PI-based first-line antiretroviral regimens in clinical trials. However, this phenomenon has not been investigated in clinical practice. To address this gap, data from patients starting a first-line lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/rtv)-based therapy with available baseline HIV-1 RNA load, a viral genotype and follow-up viral load after 3 and 6 months of treatment were extracted from the Italian Antiretroviral Resistance Cohort Analysis (ARCA) observational database. Based on survival analysis, 39 (7.1%) and 43 (7.8%) of the 548 examined patient cases had an HIV-1 RNA >500 and >50 copies/ml, respectively, after 6 months of treatment. Cox proportional hazard models detected baseline HIV-1 RNA (RH 1.79, 95%CI 1.10-2.92 per 1-log(10) increase, P=0.02) and resistance to the nucleoside backbone (RH 1.04, 95%CI 1.02-1.06 per 10-point increase using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm, P<0.001) as independent predictors of HIV-1 RNA at >500 copies/ml, but not at the >50 copies/ml cutoff criteria. Higher baseline viral load, older patient age, heterosexual route of infection and use of tenofovir/emtricitabine were predictors of failure at month 3 using the 50-copy and/or 500-copy threshold. Resistance to LPV/rtv did not occur or increase in any of the available 36 follow-up HIV-1 genotypes. Resistance to the nucleoside backbone (M184V) developed in four cases. Despite the likely differences in patient population and adherence, both the low rate of virological failure and the lack of development of LPV/rtv resistance documented in clinical trials are thus confirmed in clinical practice."
3727,0.005,1.0000,"Genotyping of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) for antiretroviral drug resistance is routinely used both in clinical practice, to guide the selection of options for an individual's antiretroviral therapy, and in epidemiological studies, to estimate levels of antiretroviral drug resistance in a patient population. However, reliance on results of a single test can result in an underestimation of antiretroviral drug resistance. In the present study, we quantified the prevalence of resistance-associated mutations found in recent genotypic tests of 1734 HIV-1-infected, treatment-experienced subjects who had at least 3 genotypic tests (n = 11,404 genotypic tests total; median, 5 tests/subject) and compared it with that of resistance-associated mutations ever detected in these subjects between 1996 and 2004. Single-point analyses underestimated antiretroviral drug resistance, particularly for nucleoside analogues, in both individuals and patient populations. For example, the prevalence of resistance-associated mutation M184V/I was 25.5% in the most recent genotypes and 58.8% in available historical genotypes. Our results suggest that analysis of a combined historical genotype rather than of a cross-sectional genotype may lead to more accurate estimates of antiretroviral drug resistance in individual patients and in patient populations."
1236,0.005,1.0000,"The present study investigated the prevalence of HIV-1 multiple infections in a population composed by 47 patients under HAART failure and enrolled at the National DST/AIDS, Program, Ministry of Health, Brazil.Detection of multiple infections was done using a previously published RFLP assay for the HIV-1 protease gene, which is able of distinguishing between infections caused by a single or multiple HIV-1 subtypes. Samples with multiple infections were cloned, and sequence data submitted to phylogenetic analysis. We were able to identify 17 HIV-1 multiple infections out of 47 samples. Multiple infections were mostly composed by a mixture of recombinant viruses (94%), with only one case in which protease gene pure subtypes B and F were recovered. This is the first study that reports the prevalence of multiple infections and intersubtype recombinants in a population undergoing HAART in Brazil. Based on the data there was a steep increase of multiple infections after the introduction of the combined antiretroviral therapy in Brazil. Cases of multiple infections may be associated with HIV-1 genetic diversity through recombination allowing for the generation of viruses showing a combination of resistance mutations. "
9517,0.005,1.0000,"To determine whether Korean red ginseng (KRG) has beneficial effects on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients administered highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we analyzed the CD4 T-cell count, viral load, and resistance mutations to HAART in 46 individuals. Thirteen patients harbored resistance mutations at baseline. The study population was divided into two groups: specifically, a group treated with a combination of HAART plus KRG (23 patients) and a group treated with HAART alone (23 patients). The annual increase in CD4 T-cell count in the combination group was significantly higher than that in the group treated with HAART alone (P < 0.05). Overall, 21 patients harbored resistance mutations after 3 years of therapy. Following exclusion of 13 patients displaying baseline resistance mutations, 7.1% of patients (1/14) in the combination group and 42.1% (8/19) in the HAART group were identified with resistance mutations. One patient with baseline resistance mutations in the combination group did not display resistance mutations 3 years after HAART therapy. High-level resistance mutations were significantly lower in the combination group than in the group treated with HAART alone. Five patients showed no improvement in viral copy number (26.3% [5/19]) in the combination group and 9 (45.0% [9/20]) showed no improvement in the HAART-only group. Our data support the clinical utility of KRG intake during HAART therapy."
9487,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is one of the most prominent health care challenges world wide. In Western industrialized countries where common access to antiretroviral drugs exists, HIV infection is a well treatable disease in the long-term for most patients. However, given the possible evolution of drug-resistance, the right combination of antiretroviral drugs in first-line therapy is crucial for maintaining long-term success. For each individual patient, the ideal time to start antiretroviral therapy must be carefully selected. The individual risk of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on the one hand, and the risks of long-term toxicity and adherence problems under therapy on the other hand must be taken into account. Each patient should be counseled according to present treatment guidelines on when and how to start HAART, taking into account the surrogate markers CD4-cell count and HIV-RNA as well as clinically apparent HIV-associated disease."
1675,0.005,1.0000,"Neurological disease associated with HIV infection results from either primary replication of the virus or a combination of virus infection and replication of opportunistic pathogens in the CNS. Recent studies indicate that the primary infection is mediated mainly by viruses that utilize CCR5 as the coreceptor; it is not known whether the syndrome can be mediated by viruses that use the CXCR4 coreceptor. The macaque model of the disease using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) has confirmed that CCR5-using viruses such as SIV(mac)251 can cause primary disease in the CNS. In this report we have examined the role of simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)(KU-2), a CXCR4 virus which replicates productively in rhesus macrophages, in causing CNS disease. A survey of archival brain tissues from SHIV(KU-2)-infected rhesus and pig-tailed macaques that succumbed to AIDS showed productive viral replication in the CNS of 10 of 14 rhesus animals. Eight of these 10 had additional infections with opportunistic pathogens. In contrast, 21 of 22 pig-tailed macaques had no evidence of productive viral infection in the brain. In an earlier study we had shown that inoculation of SHIV-infected rhesus macaques with eggs of Schistosoma mansoni, a potent inducer of IL-4, resulted in enhanced replication of the virus in tissue macrophages. In the present study, we compared the replication of the virus in macrophages from normal rhesus and pig-tailed macaques and determined further whether exogenous IL-4 could cause enhancement of virus replication in these cells. These studies showed that the virus replicated productively in rhesus macrophages, and this was enhanced significantly after recombinant macaque IL-4 was added to the medium. IL-4 also caused enhancement of virus production in macrophages isolated from virus-infected animals. In contrast, the virus replicated only minimally in pig-tailed macaque macrophages and supplemental IL-4 had negligible effects. The data thus suggested that failure of pig-tailed macaques to develop encephalitis was due to the innate resistance of macrophages from this species of macaque to support replication of SHIV(KU-2). The ability of the virus to replicate in the brains of rhesus macaques was dependent on coinfection in the brain with opportunistic pathogens which presumably induced both macrophages and IL-4 in the CNS microenvironment. A supportive role for IL-4 in the CNS disease was suggested by the presence of IL-4 RNA in the encephalitic brains of rhesus macaques and reduced levels of this cytokine in the brains from pig-tailed macaques."
2954,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection treated with alpha interferon and subsequent loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) eliminate HDV. HDV RNA was detected in 26 of 28 patients with chronic delta hepatitis using the polymerase chain reaction. Seventeen patients in whom HDV RNA was detected were treated with alpha interferon; in 65%, HDV RNA remained detectable during treatment or reappeared after stopping therapy whereas in three patients HDV RNA remained absent (17.5%). HDV RNA became and remained undetectable in serum and liver of two of these three patients who lost HBsAg from serum and in one patient who was intermittently HBsAg negative during therapy. After loss of HBsAg, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was still detectable in the liver, but not HBV RNA, indicating absent or very low HBV replication. Three patients were lost to follow up (17.5%). Two nontreated patients with chronic HDV infection also lost HBsAg during follow up; HDV RNA also became undetectable in their serum. Thus, HDV replication does not persist after the loss of HBsAg. Clearance of HBsAg may be a useful guide to when therapy can be stopped."
9760,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of serum markers of delta hepatitis was determined prospectively in 82 intravenous drug abusers at various stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Seventeen were HIV negative, 30 were HIV positive without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 35 had been diagnosed as having AIDS. Antihepatitis D virus (HDV) in serum was measured by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and also by solid phase capture radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HDV. HDV antigen and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA were also measured. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBs were determined by using a commercially available RIA. Anti-HDV (RIA) was only detected in serum that contained HBsAg. These anti-HDV (RIA) positive samples also tested positive with the commercial anti-HDV electroimmunoassay. In addition, the commercial anti-HDV ELISA detected anti-HDV in some serum samples that were negative for HBsAg; these anti HDV-positive HBsAg-negative samples were frequently lipemic or contained rheumatoid factor. The prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBs did not differ significantly with the stage of HIV disease. HBsAg was detected in 3 of 13 (23%) HIV-negative, 5 of 29 (17%) HIV-positive, and 4 of 18 (22%) patients with AIDS. IgG and IgM anti-HDV (RIA) was positive in 2 of 3 HIV-negative and 4 of 5 HIV-positive pre-AIDS HBsAg-positive subjects. However, none of 4 AIDS patients had anti-HDV. The difference between AIDS and non-AIDS patients was statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.03). HDV antigen was detected in serum from one AIDS patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8813,0.005,1.0000,"A previous study revealed a high prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA among 249 apparently healthy individuals (mean+/-standard deviation age, 48.4+/-13.9 years; 126 males and 123 females) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. To investigate further the prevalence of HDV infection there, the same serum samples obtained from the cohort were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antibody to HDV (anti-HDV) by a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant hepatitis delta antigen protein expressed in the pupae of silkworm as the antigen probe. Anti-HDV was detected in 42 persons (16.9%), among whom 22 (52.4%) were positive for HBsAg and 20 (47.6%) had detectable HDV RNA. Among 170 persons with anti-HBc in the absence of HBsAg, 20 (11.8%) tested positive for anti-HDV, and 1 of the 20 subjects was positive for HDV RNA. Of note, none of 55 anti-HBc-negative persons had anti-HDV, supporting the specificity of the anti-HDV assay. The optical density (OD) value of anti-HDV was significantly higher among HDV RNA-positive subjects (n=21) than among HDV RNA-negative subjects (n=21) (2.513+/-0.514 vs. 0.836+/-0.550, P<0.0001). The present study confirmed the extremely high prevalence of HDV infection in Mongolia, and identified a person who was positive for both anti-HDV and HDV RNA despite negativity for HBsAg and HBV DNA probably due to viral interference. The anti-HDV assay may be useful for further epidemiological studies on HDV infection in larger cohorts in urban and rural areas of Mongolia, where elucidation of the transmission route of HDV is required urgently."
5716,0.005,1.0000,"It is generally agreed that hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication is reduced by hepatitis delta virus infection (HDV) and augmented by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, the precise nature of the interactions between HBV, HDV and HIV is controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of HIV infection on HBV and HDV replication, and on histological scores during delta virus superinfection in HDV-positive, chronic carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). We studied 38 men and six women, 15 of whom were HIV-positive and all of whom had at least one marker of HDV infection. Serum hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), HBV DNA, HDV RNA, anti-delta antigen antibodies (anti-HD) IgM, anti-HD IgG and hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) were tested for in the serum and liver, respectively; anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies were detected using a second-generation recombinant immunoblot assay. Histological specimens were scored blindly according to Knodell's classification for periportal and intralobular necrosis, portal inflammation and fibrosis. HBV DNA was detected more frequently in the HIV-positive patients than in those who were HIV-negative (25 vs 0%; P = 0.01), while markers of HDV replication (serum anti-HD IgM, serum HDV RNA and liver HDAg) were as frequent in the HIV-positive patients (69%, 40% and 50%, respectively) as in those who were HIV-negative (75%, 52% and 30%, respectively; P > 0.05). By contrast, 31% of the HIV-positive patients were serum HDAg-positive compared to only 6% of the HIV-negative patients (P = 0.001). HDV antigenaemia and anti-HD antibodies usually fluctuated in the HIV-positive patients during follow-up. The mean Knodell score was similar in the HIV-positive (11.5 +/- 3.2) and HIV-negative (10.7 +/- 2) subgroups, as was the mean semi-quantitative index of hepatic necrosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Our results provide evidence that in HDV-positive patients: (1) HIV infection counters the inhibitory effect of HDV superinfection on HBV replication; (2) serum anti-HD IgM. HDV RNA and liver HDAg are not more frequent in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative patients, suggesting that HIV infection has no effect on HDV replication (although the significance of the increased frequency of HD antigenaemia remains unclear); (3) the histological severity of liver disease is not influenced by HIV status."
6356,0.005,1.0000,"In this study, we tested 137 Turkish children with cancer (51 with acute leukemia, 48 with lymphoma, 38 with solid tumors) while they were undergoing chemotherapy, and a control group of 45 for evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The control group included children with other disease who had applied to the outpatient clinic during the study period and had no history of jaundice or transfusion. Sixty-five (47.4%) patients with cancer and 7 (20%) children in the control group were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (p < 0.01). HBV DNA was detected in 59 (43.1%) patients and in 9 (20%) controls (p < 0.01). HCV specific antibody (anti-HCV) was detected in 8 (5.8%) patients and in 1 (2.2%) control (p > 0.05). Eight patients (5.8%) had circulating HCV RNA, but none had in the control group (p = 0.09). Ten (13.9%) of the 72 patients who were negative for HBsAg had circulating HBV DNA, and 7 (5.4%) of the 129 patients who were negative for anti-HCV had circulating HCV RNA. We concluded that HBV and HCV infections are common among Turkish children with cancer. In countries where HBV infection is widespread among the general population as in Turkey, children with cancer are under greater risk for HBV infection."
6990,0.005,1.0000,"Injection drug use (IDU) is one of the most significant risk factors for viral hepatitis (B, D and C) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, there is little information about the risk of infection among non-injection drug users (non-IDUs). The present study was designed to perform several objectives: (a) to evaluate the prevalence of serological markers of hepatitis B, D, C virus and HIV in IDU and non-IDU patients; (b) to compare the prevalence of these markers between both groups; (c) to identify risk factors for HCV and HIV in this population; and (d) to correlate the presence of HCV and liver function. A total of 385 consecutive patients (122 IDUs and 263 non-IDUs), admitted to the Drug Dependency Treatment Unit at the Hospital Insular of Gran Canaria between 1993 to 1994, were included in the study. The serological markers of HBV, HDV, HCV and HIV were determined by ELISA and immunoblot methods. In all cases we also measured syphilis tests (RPR and FTAabs), serum aminotransferases and serum gammaglutamiltranspeptidase. Compared to the non-IDU, the IDU group presents a higher prevalence of antiHBc (55.0% vs. 20.7%, p < 0.0001), antiHCV (87.6% vs. 35.3%, p < 0.0001) and antiHIV (21.8% vs. 2.7%, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in RPR positivity (0.9% vs. 4.9%, p = 0.06). Delta infection was only detected in injection drug users, and the prevalence was low. Using logistic regression, the only risk factors associated with antiHCV positivity were injection drug addiction (OR: 9.2, 95% CI: 4.9-17.0) and antiHBc positivity (OR: 5.5, 95% CI: 3.0-9.9). Similarly, the associated risk factors for HIV were injection drug addiction (OR: 5.9, 95% CI: 2.3-15.0) and antiHBc positivity (OR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.5-9.2). However, no correlation was found between antiHCV positive and antiHIV or between these markers and RPR positivity. Patients positive for antiHCV showed significant elevations in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, when compared with patients negative for antiHCV: 65.0 vs. 39.2 U/l (p < 0.001) and 88.4 vs. 40.3 U/l (p < 0.001), respectively. We conclude that drug users have an elevated prevalence of HCV, HBV and HIV infection, even if drug use is only inhalated. On the other hand, the main risk factors associated with HCV and HIV are injection drug addiction and exposure to hepatitis B virus. Finally, in the study population, liver dysfunction is closely related to HCV infection."
1506,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy has increased the survival of patients with HIV/AIDS, thus necessitating health promotion practice with immunization. Vaccines are critical components for protecting people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The purpose of study was to analyze the vaccination status of PLWHA in outpatient care in Fortaleza, Cear√°, Brazil. Cross-sectional study performed from June 2014 to June 2015. The screening was done with patients in antiretroviral therapy, 420 patients underwent screening, but only 99 met the inclusion criteria. Data were collected for interviews using forms to characterize sociodemographic, clinical and vaccination situations. Only 14 patients had complete vaccination schedules. The most used vaccines were hepatitis B, influenza vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal. There was no difference between men and women regarding the proportion of PLWHA with full vaccination schedule or between sex, skin color, marital status, sexual orientation, religion or occupational status. There was no difference between having or not having a complete vaccination schedule and age, years of education, family income or number of hospitalizations. CD4+ T-cells count of patients with incomplete immunization was lower than patients with complete immunization. Health education strategies can be done individually or in groups to explain the importance of vaccination and to remind about doses to be administered. Most patients did not have proper adherence to vaccination schedules, especially due to lack of guidance. Results implied that education in health is important for vaccination adhesion, knowledge of adverse events and continuation of schemes. "
2732,0.005,1.0000,"In order to assess the adequacy of learning about the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in vocational training for general practice, a postal questionnaire survey was carried out among trainers and their trainees in seven health regions of England and Scotland. A total of 616 trainers (62%) and 538 trainees (58%) responded to the questionnaire asking about their knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding HIV and AIDS. Trainees' principal difficulties with HIV and AIDS resembled those of general practitioners currently in practice. More than 60% of trainees lacked knowledge about HIV and AIDS in babies, 50% would not accept intravenous drug misusers onto their list, only 12% found it easy to discuss sex with homosexual male patients, and only 37% felt able to offer counselling about HIV and AIDS. Trainees who had had a tutorial on HIV and AIDS as part of vocational training were significantly more knowledgeable than the remainder (P less than 0.01). In addition, trainees who found workshops on HIV and AIDS useful were more willing than others to take on drug misusers (P less than 0.05) and more confident in their ability to counsel patients with HIV infection (P less than 0.01). No significant associations were found between the trainers' own knowledge, attitudes and skills regarding HIV and AIDS and those of their trainees. It is concluded that there is a need to improve teaching about HIV and AIDS in vocational training for general practice. All general practitioner trainees should receive a tutorial to update their knowledge about HIV and AIDS, and attend a suitable workshop to challenge unfavourable attitudes and improve confidence in counselling."

The incidence rate in China is escalating obviously. Currently there is lack of large samples and long-term systematic observations of ocular pathological changes in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected and AIDS patients. Diagnostic errors and missed diagnosis still exist in hospitals, even in some advanced hospitals. They delay the therapy of patients, also easily result in hospital acquired infections. It is notable that there is insufficient attention to preoperative test of anti-HIV in some hospitals, especially in outpatient surgeries. Therefore potential iatrogenic infection risks are hidden. Some clinical doctors are afraid of AIDS patients, therefore they are lack of subjective initiative to comprehensively examination and treatment the patients. For the past few years, highly active antiretroviral therapy is widely used, AIDS related morbidity and mortality is significantly reduced, and the prevalence rate of ocular complications decreased from 55% to 95%. But due to the HIV/AIDS patient volume increased year by year, and the survival rate raised, prolonged survival, results in the increase of the absolute number of patients with ocular complications. Therefore it is critical to pay attention to the HIV/AIDS ocular lesions in the diagnosis and treatment of iatrogenic infection. "
1525,0.005,1.0000,"Natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is very rare. The authors encountered a case of NK/T-cell lymphoma in a 36-year-old man who presented with an ulcerative mass on both tonsils. During assessment, HIV positivity was noted. The EBV was detected by EBV-encoded RNA 1 messenger RNA in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction for EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1. On immunohistochemical staining, the infiltrated lymphoid cells of the tonsils demonstrated positvity for CD3, CD56, UCHL1, and granzyme, a finding compatible with NK/T-cell lymphoma. The patient received radiation therapy and chemotherapy, but died as a result of opportunistic infection of invasive aspergillosis after tumor recurrence. An autopsy was done with the consent of the patient's family. To our knowledge, this is the first case in an HIV patient of NK/T-cell lymphoma of the tonsils associated with EBV, confirmed by autopsy. NK/T-cell lymphoma should be considered in the HIV-positive patients with an ulcerating tonsillar mass."
8240,0.005,1.0000,"A survey of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) regarding human immunodeficiency virus infection was performed on 899 students from 3 government-administered high schools located in the Bangkok Metropolitan area. Initially, all students completed a written questionnaire (pre-test) regarding HIV/AIDS. Following this, they attended a slide lecture presentation given by a specialist physician. The same test questionnaire was then completed by the same students six weeks (post-test) later for comparison of their previous KAP. The subjects composed of male to female ratio equal to that of the median age 15-16 years old. Sixty-seven per cent of the subjects were living with their parents, 16.3 per cent with relatives and 15 per cent with friends. Ninety nine per cent of the subjects had received information on HIV/AIDS before enrollment to this study. The source of knowledge ranged from television (89.1%), teachers (81.6%), pamphlets (80.2%), newspapers (75%), radio (55%), health care workers (53.4%), friends (38.6%) and only 32.5 per cent from their parents. The subjects' knowledge about HIV/AIDS and risk factors in the post-test questionnaire was significantly increased (P < 0.001) from the pre-test status. However, their attitudes to an HIV infected person were not significantly changed in the post-test questionnaire: only the ""attending school"" question showed significantly (P < 0.05) increased numbers of agreement. Similarly, the attitudes and practices to prevent HIV infection were not significantly (P > 0.05) different between pre-test and post-test questionnaires. The result of this study is to recommend regular school-based programs of education to increase awareness of preventive strategies for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases."
8720,0.005,1.0000,"One hundred thirty-four homosexual men from a prospective cohort study of AIDS risk from New York City and Washington D.C. and 139 homosexual men from a similar cohort in Copenhagen and Aarhus, Denmark were questioned regarding their sexual practices and knowledge of their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status over the previous 12 months. Seventy percent of Danish men and 63% of U.S. men participated in anal intercourse during the previous 12 months. Knowledge of one's own HIV status by itself did not have any significant effect on participation in anal intercourse, partner number, or condom use. Only 23% of U.S. men and 24% of Danish men always asked potential partners about their HIV status. However, men who did ask were very unlikely to choose a partner of opposite HIV status (p less than 0.006). Danish men were more likely to practice anal intercourse without a condom than were the U.S. men (p less than 0.0001); however, Danes were more likely to be in a concordant monogamous relationship than were the U.S. men (p less than 0.001). Fourteen percent of U.S. men and 21% of Danish men were not aware of their own HIV status and 52% of the U.S. cohort and 31% of the Danes had anal intercourse with a man whose status was unknown to them. Overall, only 32% of American and 53% of Danish homosexual men were practicing completely safe sex. We suggest that education to promote the need for awareness of one's own and one's partner's HIV status should be stressed."

From 1987 to 2004, 1,614 HIV-positive patients were officially reported to the Nicaraguan STI/HIV/AIDS national program. Urban areas along the west-central and eastern part of Nicaragua showed the highest prevalence of AIDS, with a maximum of 54.2/year per 100,000 inhabitants. Most of the infections (91%) were acquired sexually: 65% by heterosexual contacts and 26% by homosexual contacts. The highest rate of infection was found in men aged between 20 to 39 years, with a peak around 35 to 39 years (annual incidence of 125.6 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants), and in women aged 20 to 34 years old, with a peak around 20 to 24 years (annual incidence 46.6 per 100,000 inhabitants). The male to female ratio of infection was 3:1. The death rate was stable until the beginning of 1999, but increased sharply thereafter up to 2004, the year that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced in Nicaragua. In 2005, we observed a further increase in the mortality. However, our data do not represent the magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a whole, due to a lack of systemic surveillance. HIV/AIDS in Nicaragua is in a nascent stage and is concentrated in high-risk populations, such as utility workers, commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, prisoners, street children, housewives and police and military forces. Education of the population is an urgent need to increase HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, change attitudes, and increase safer sex practice in the community."
6538,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been postulated to alter the natural history of cholera, including increased susceptibility to infection, severity of illness, and chronic carriage of Vibrio cholerae Haiti has a generalized HIV epidemic with an adult HIV prevalence of 1.9% and recently suffered a cholera epidemic. We conducted a prospective study at the cholera treatment center (CTC) of GHESKIO in Haiti to characterize the coinfection. Adults admitted at the CTC for acute diarrhea were invited to participate in the study. Vital signs, frequency, and volume of stools and/or vomiting were monitored, and single-dose doxycycline was administered. After counseling, participants were screened for HIV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for cholera by culture. Of 729 adults admitted to the CTC, 99 (13.6%) had HIV infection, and 457 (63%) had culture-confirmed cholera. HIV prevalence was three times higher in patients without cholera (23%, 63/272) than in those with culture-confirmed cholera (7.9%, 36/457). HIV prevalence in patients with culture-confirmed cholera (7.9%) was four times higher than the adult prevalence in Port-au-Prince (1.9%). Of the 36 HIV-infected patients with cholera, 25 (69%) had moderate/severe dehydration versus 302/421 (72%) in the HIV negative. Of 30 HIV-infected patients with weekly stool cultures performed after discharge, 29 (97%) were negative at week 1. Of 50 HIV-negative patients with weekly stool cultures, 49 (98%) were negative at week 1. In countries with endemic HIV infection, clinicians should consider screening patients presenting with suspected cholera for HIV coinfection."
4721,0.005,1.0000,"Intestinal microsporidiosis is most commonly associated with persistent diarrhea in advanced AIDS cases. To determine the prevalence and clinical manifestations of this infection in HIV/AIDS patients, a single fresh stool sample and blood were collected from 243 (214 HIV-positive and 29 HIV-negative) diarrheal patients. The presence of intestinal microsporidiosis in the stool was determined by Uvitex-2B staining and a PCR-based detection method. HIV screening was done by using ELISA, and reactive samples were confirmed by Western blotting. The CD4+ cell count was analyzed using FACScan. Out of 243 diarrheal patients, 39 (16.0%) cases were positive for intestinal microsporidial infection by either of the methods used. Of the 39, only 18 cases positive by microscopy were also positive by PCR. Based on PCR and microscopic analyses the microsporidial parasites were identified as Enterocytozoon bieneusi (30), Ecephalitozoon intestinalis (6), and double infections (3). All microsporidia-positive cases were HIV-positive, and 92.3% had diarrhea for over 4 weeks. The diarrhea was watery in 79.5% of the patients. Weight loss >10% was recorded in 37 (94.9%) cases. The CD4+ cell count was <100 cells/mm(3) in 84.4% of subjects, and 59.4% of the patients had a CD4+ cell count of < or =50 cells/mm(3), with a mean of 22.8 cells/mm(3). This study revealed that intestinal microsporidiosis is a common cause of chronic diarrhea and severe weight loss in advanced AIDS patients in Ethiopia. This condition is attributable mainly to E. bieneusi. Thus, early diagnosis of intestinal microsporidiosis in HIV/AIDS patients would certainly be helpful in the understanding and management of diarrheal illness."
6755,0.005,1.0000,"The study aimed to clarify clinical significance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) rtA181S mutation in Chinese HBV-infected patients. A total of 18 419 patients with chronic HBV infection from Beijing 302 Hospital were investigated. HBV complete reverse transcriptase region of polymerase was screened by direct sequencing, and the results were verified by clonal sequencing. Replication-competent mutant and wild-type HBV genomic amplicons were constructed and transfected into the HepG2 cells and cultured in the presence or absence of serially diluted nucleos(t)ide analogues. Intracellular HBV replicative intermediates were quantitated for calculating the 50% effective concentration of the drug (EC(50)). The rtA181S was detected in 98 patients with 12 kinds of mutational patterns. Genotype C and genotype B HBV infection occupied 91.8% and 8.2% in rtA181S-positive patients, in contrast to 84.6% and 15.4% in rtA181S-negative patients (P < 0.01). All rtA181S-positive patients had received nucleos(t)ide analogues. rtA181S was detected in multiple patients with virologic breakthrough. Phenotypic analysis of patient-derived viral strains showed that rtA181S, rtA181S+N236T, rtN236T and rtA181V strains had 68.5%, 49.9%, 71.4% and 66.2% of natural replication capacity of wild-type strain, and 3.7-fold, 9.8-fold, 7.9-fold and 5.6-fold increased EC(50) to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). The rtA181S strain remained susceptible to lamivudine, entecavir and tenofovir, and ADV susceptibility was restored after the mutation was eliminated through site-directed mutagenesis. Rescue therapy with entecavir or combination therapy was effective in rtA181S-related ADV-refractory patients. The rtA181S mutation confers moderate resistance to ADV. It could be induced by either lamivudine or ADV and contribute ADV treatment failure."
6252,0.005,1.0000,"Cytologic and histologic investigations of the uterine cervix and studies of the lymphocyte functions were performed in human immunodeficiency virus-infected and human immunodeficiency virus antibody-negative women to study possible linkages between human papillomavirus-induced dysplasia and degree of human immunodeficiency virus-induced immunosuppression. Cytologic smears of the uterine cervix of 111 human immunodeficiency virus-infected women were compared with findings in 76 female intravenous drug users negative for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies and in a group of 526 women of the outpatient population of the hospital. Cervical dysplasia-neoplasia (including five cases of invasive carcinoma) was seen in 41% of the human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. In human immunodeficiency virus-negative intravenous drug users dysplasia-neoplasia was seen in 9%, and in the sample from outpatients in 4%, including two cases of invasive carcinoma (p less than 0.01). Cytologic features that were attributable to infection with human papillomavirus were observed in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women four times more often than in the sample from the outpatient population (p less than 0.01). Frequency and severity of dysplasia appear to increase with diminishing numbers of CD4+ helper/inducer T lymphocytes and correlated significantly (p less than 0.01) with a loss of blastogenic response to phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, and tetanus toxoid. These results suggest an increased risk for the development of dysplasia of the uterine cervix in women with human immunodeficiency virus infection, which is related to the degree of immunosuppression."
5815,0.005,1.0000,"Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is a recently discovered hepatitis B virus (HBV) receptor. In the present study, we used TK-NOG mice with a humanized liver to examine the impact of endogenous NTCP expression on HBV infection. Upon inoculation with HBV, these mice exhibited clear viremia in 2 weeks, and serum HBV DNA levels gradually increased. The frequency of HBsAg-positive hepatocytes in the liver was 5.1‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.6% at 2 weeks and increased with increasing HBV DNA levels, reaching 92.9‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ2.8% at 10 to 12 weeks. In vivo siRNA-mediated NTCP knockdown before and after HBV inoculation significantly suppressed the levels of HBV replication and the frequency of HBsAg-positive hepatocytes at 2 weeks, whereas NTCP knockdown 13 weeks after infection did not affect these parameters. Similar to the humanized mouse livers in the early phase of HBV infection, human liver samples from chronic hepatitis B patients, especially those treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues, contained a considerable number of hepatocytes that were negative for the anti-HBs antibody. In conclusion, NTCP inhibition prevents the spread of HBV-infected hepatocytes in mice with a humanized liver. NTCP-targeted therapy has potential for regulating HBV infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B."
376,0.005,1.0000,"The transmission of antiretroviral-resistant HIV-1 strains is associated with suboptimal virological responses to initial antiretroviral therapy. However, certain types of resistance mutations are known to be associated with decreased viral fitness, which confers a lower replication capacity than that of the wild-type virus in the absence of antiretroviral drugs. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between antiretroviral resistance mutations and viral replication in the primary HIV-1 infection (PHI) period. From January 2002 to March 2005, 52 PHI patients were identified in the Republic of Korea. HIV-1 RNA genotyping was performed, and the resistance mutation score was obtained from the HIV Drug Resistance Database of Stanford University. We defined the sum of the average resistance mutation scores (SARMS) for each antiretroviral drug class as a measure of the degree of resistance of any specific strain. The overall mean SARMS was 2.00 +/- 2.74, and the annual mean did not change significantly during the study period. No critical resistance mutation gene was identified in the study group. The SARMS showed a weak negative correlation with the viral load log10 during PHI, but without statistical significance (r = -0.274, p = 0.051). But the mean SARMS of patients with a viral load exceeding 100,000 copies/ml was significantly lower than that of patients with a viral load of less than 100,000 copies/ml (p = 0.03). Evaluation of the potency of antiretroviral resistance revealed a weak negative correlation with viral replication in the PHI period. This could be one reason why the transmission of resistant strains in PHI patients is not increasing significantly despite the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)."
5674,0.005,1.0000,"The objectives of this study were to establish a simple model based on quantitative serum markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection to understand the complex immune response to HBV. Patients samples were obtained from individuals with active HBV infection (alanine transaminase [ALT]-positive, aspartate aminotransferase [AST]-positive and HBsAg-positive), or patients who had recovered from infection (ALT-negative, AST-negative, anti-HBs-positive and either HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBe or anti-HBc positive). HBV quantitative markers, including HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HBe, and anti-HBc, were measured using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Based on cut-off values, anti-HBs levels were converted to a ratio (sample value/cut-off value, RV). Anti-HBe and anti-HBc levels were determined using a competition method, resulting in the use of a ratio (cut-off value/sample value, RV) for determination of anti-HBe and anti-HBc values. The greater RV value in a patient was considered as a trait marker for HBV infection (TMHB) of this patient. Patients with TMHB including HBsAg or HBeAg were defined as TMHB-Ag; and patients with TMHB including anti-HBs, anti-HBe, or anti-HBc TMHB were defined as TMHB-Ab. The percentage of patients determined to be TMHB-Ag was 96.3% in the HBV group. The percentage of patients determined to be TMHB-Ab was 94.7% in recovery group. TMHBs could be used to analyze different status of HBV infection."
5207,0.005,1.0000,"The genetic basis for didanosine (ddl) resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) has previously been shown to be commonly associated with a Leu to Val change at codon 74 in the HIV-1 RT gene. In this study sequential viral isolates were analyzed from five patients with prior zidovudine (AZT) use who received 6 to 16 months of ddl therapy. Following ddl therapy, viral isolates exhibited an increased AZT susceptibility and decreased ddl susceptibility. Sequence and nested PCR analysis of the HIV-1 RT gene revealed that two viral isolates contained the Leu to Val change at codon 74, and three other isolates with reduced susceptibility to ddl each contained changes at codons 65, 70, and 72. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to insert specific mutations in RT gene of proviral clone pNL4-3. Analysis of virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity indicated that the Lys70Arg mutation resulted in an enzyme with 2- to 4-fold decreased susceptibility to ddATP. Statistical analysis of the inhibitory concentration for RT activity between pNL4-3 and mutant Lys70Arg viruses obtained in three independent RT inhibition assays was significant (P = 0.05) by student t test paired analysis. Drug susceptibility assays on the virus with Lys70Arg mutation showed a marginal decrease in susceptibility to ddl (1.5- to 2-fold) and about 4- to 6-fold decrease in susceptibility to AZT. Mutations Lys65Glu and Arg72Ser resulted in an impaired RT with greatly diminished functional RT activity. The AZT-associated Lys70Arg mutation results in an RT enzyme with decreased susceptibility to ddATP."
3436,0.005,1.0000,"The drug resistance profile of treatment-naive HIV-infected individuals living in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was studied. Samples taken from 94 drug-naive individuals with established HIV infection and 13 patients with primary HIV infection were assessed by nucleotide sequencing and LIPA. The prevalence of drug-associated primary mutations in individuals with established infection was very low. In the viral protease region, 1/86 (1.2%) individuals carried the D30N mutation, whereas 1/85 (1.2%) had the M41L mutation in the reverse transcriptase (RT) region. Secondary mutations in both the protease and RT regions were found in almost 90% of the individuals. In individuals with primary infection, primary mutations were detected in 2/13 (15.4%) patients, one of them carrying M461 mutation in the protease while the other patient had a mutation at codon 184 of the RT. In accordance with current drug resistance testing guidelines, the results of this study suggest that susceptibility tests need not be performed at this time prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected people in Argentina. However, the public health implications of this subject warrant follow-up studies that will examine a larger number of drug-naive patients, not only in Buenos Aires but also in other major Argentinian cities and in rural areas."
3820,0.005,1.0000,"Multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains with reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations at codons A62-->V, V75-->I, F77-->L, F116-->Y, and Q151-->M have been reported in patients receiving combination therapy with zidovudine (AZT) and didanosine (ddI). Infectious clones with each mutation alone, all five mutations together, and various combinations of mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation Q151-->M conferred partial resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine, whereas a combination of four mutations conferred increased resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine. The positions of residues 75, 77, and 151 in the three-dimensional crystal structure of HIV-1 RT suggest that these residues may affect the ability of the enzyme to discriminate between deoxynucleoside triphosphates and nucleoside analog RT inhibitors. Replication experiments showed that clones with mutation F77-->L but without V75-->I (HIV-1(77), HIV-1(77,151), and HIV-1(77,116,151) had attenuated growth compared with that of the original HIV-1NL4-3 strain and strains containing mutations at both positions 75 and 77 (HIV-1(75,77,151) and HIV-1(75,77,116,15)). Sequence analysis of viral RNA and proviral DNA from several patients indicated that RT mutations developed in a sequential and cumulative pattern over the course of a 2- to 4-year observation period. The present results suggest that drug resistance and viral replicative capacity both may play a role in selection of HIV-1 RT mutations."
7893,0.005,1.0000,"We have evaluated the use of an ultrasensitive reverse transcriptase (RT) activity assay to monitor plasma viremia in two human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) group O-infected patients treated with stavudine, lamivudine, and indinavir. After a initial decline in RT levels observed at 4 weeks of therapy, RT-based plasma viremia returned to baseline values at 28 or 44 weeks of treatment. The rebound in levels of RT activity was associated with the detection of phenotypic resistance to lamivudine and with the Met184Val mutation. Analysis of RT activity in plasma provides a sequence-independent means of monitoring virus loads in HIV-1 group O-infected patients."
4875,0.005,1.0000,"The methionine-to-valine mutation in codon 184 (M184V) in reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) confers resistance to (-)-2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC; lamivudine) and increased sensitivity to 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (PMPA; tenofovir). We have used the SIV model to evaluate the effect of the M184V mutation on the emergence of resistance to the combination of 3TC plus PMPA. A site-directed mutant of SIVmac239 containing M184V (SIVmac239-184V) was used to select for resistance to both 3TC and PMPA by serial passage in the presence of increasing concentrations of both drugs. Under these selection conditions, the M184V mutation reverted in the majority of the selections. Variants resistant to both drugs were found to have the lysine-to-arginine mutation at codon 65 (K65R), which has previously been associated with resistance to PMPA in both SIV and HIV. Similarly, in rhesus macaques infected with SIVmac239-184V for 46 weeks and treated daily with (-)-2'-deoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine [(-)-FTC], there was no reversion of M184V, but this mutation reverted to 184 M in all three animals within 24 weeks of treatment with (-)-FTC and PMPA. Although the addition of PMPA to the (-)-FTC therapy induced a decrease in virus loads in plasma, these loads eventually returned to pre-PMPA levels in each case. All animals receiving this combination developed the K65R mutation. These results demonstrate that the combination of PMPA with 3TC or (-)-FTC selects for the K65R mutation and against the M184V mutation in SIV RT."

We examined the association of the HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 alleles with the emergence of mutations in the complete protease gene and the first 330 codons of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene of HIV-1, studying their distribution and persistence and their impact on antiviral drug therapy. The clinical data for 179 HIV-infected patients, the results of HLA genotyping, and virus sequences were analyzed using a variety of statistical approaches. We describe new HLA-associated mutations in both viral protease and RT, several of which are associated with HLA-DRB1. The mutations reported are remarkably persistent within our cohort, developing more slowly in a minority of patients. Interestingly, several HLA-associated mutations occur at the same positions as drug resistance mutations in patient viruses, where the viral sequence was acquired before exposure to these drugs. The influence of HLA on thymidine analogue mutation pathways was not observed. We were able to confirm immune-driven selection pressure by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II alleles through the identification of HLA-associated mutations. HLA-B alleles were involved in more associations (68%) than either HLA-A (23%) or HLA-DRB1 (9%). As several of the HLA-associated mutations lie at positions associated with drug resistance, our results indicate possible negative effects of HLA genotypes on the development of HIV-1 drug resistance."
8221,0.005,1.0000,"The RNA genome of the lentivirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is significantly richer in adenine nucleotides than the statistically equal distribution of the four different nucleotides that is expected. This compositional bias may be due to the guanine-to-adenine (G-->A) nucleotide hypermutation of the HIV genome, which has been explained by dCTP pool imbalances during reverse transcription. The adenine nucleotide bias together with the poor fidelity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase markedly enhances the genetic variation of HIV and may be responsible for the rapid emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. We have now attempted to counteract the normal mutational pattern of HIV-1 in response to anti-HIV-1 drugs by altering the endogenous deoxynucleoside triphosphate pool ratios with antimetabolites in virus-infected cell cultures. We showed that administration of these antimetabolic compounds resulted in an altered drug resistance pattern due to the reversal of the predominant mutational flow of HIV (G-->A) to an adenine-to-guanine (A-->G) nucleotide pattern in the intact HIV-1-infected lymphocyte cultures. Forcing the virus to change its inherent nucleotide bias may lead to better control of viral drug resistance development."
3070,0.005,1.0000,"We have previously described the development of a lipopeptide-based vaccine, Theradigm-HBV, capable of inducing CTL responses in humans. This vaccine incorporates the HLA-A2.1-restricted CTL epitope hepatitis B core Ag 18-27, linked to the universal helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitope tetanus toxoid (TT) 830-843. Herein, we report the results of a phase I trial designed to examine the effects of Theradigm-HBV dose and regimen on the magnitude and duration of the memory CTL response. A total of four injections of up to 5 mg/dose were found to be a safe and effective means of generating substantial memory CTL responses. Precursor frequency analysis demonstrated CTL responses of similar magnitude to those previously observed in patients who successfully cleared hepatitis B virus infection and to influenza-specific memory CTL responses induced by natural exposure to influenza virus. Theradigm-HBV induced CTL responses that persisted for more than 9 months after the last injection. HTL responses were associated with significant CTL responses, and sustained HTL activity was necessary for development of persistent memory CTL activity. These results represent the first demonstration of the importance of HTL activity for development of long-lived memory CTL responses in humans. In conclusion, our results show that lipopeptides safely induce specific CTL activity in humans of such magnitude and persistence as to be of potential therapeutic significance."

Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection have reduced numbers of DCs which may be functionally impaired, a defect that may contribute to viral persistence. Autologous DC-based immunotherapy is considered to be a treatment option for chronic HBV infection (CHB). We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of HBV-pulsed DCs in combination with the antiviral drug entecavir in patients with CHB. Eighty patients were divided into four groups: HBV-pulsed DCs only, HBV-pulsed DCs plus entecavir, entecavir only, and an untreated control group. Patients on combination therapy exhibited greater antiviral responses than patients on either monotherapy. The combination of HBV-pulsed DCs and entecavir resulted in the largest reduction in serum viral DNA levels and the highest percentage of virologic response. In addition, combination therapy resulted in viral e antigen (HBeAg) loss and seroconversion. These results suggest that the combination of HBV-pulsed autologous DCs and entecavir could be therapeutically advantageous for patients with CHB. "
6304,0.005,1.0000,"In Italy, although the most recent guidelines stress the importance of screening for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) those subjects considered to be at high risk (e.g., injecting drug users), not all drug users being treated at public drug dependency centres are regularly tested for these infections. The results of the present study show that 7.2%, 13.0%, and 7.4% of injecting drug users seeking treatment at public drug dependency centres are not tested for, respectively, HIV, HBV and HCV infections and while corresponding figures for drug users who do not inject drugs are 20.3%, 25.1% and 16.2%. The failure to undergo testing among injectors was associated with a shorter history of drug use and with drug centres in central or southern Italy; these associations were also found among non-injectors, with the addition of low level of education. The results stress the importance of facilitating access to testing, of providing the drug dependency centres with the necessary resources for taking blood samples at the centres themselves, of making access to (and performance of) testing uniform throughout the country, and of removing obstacles that can lead to the drug user's refusal to undergo testing."
8736,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C, previously termed parenterally transmitted NANB hepatitis, is caused by a single-stranded RNA virus (HCV). Infection with this virus has epidemiologic characteristics similar to hepatitis B, with infection from contaminated blood appearing to be a primary source of disease. Although 80% to 90% of the viral hepatitis associated with blood transfusions used to be the most common mechanism for HCV transmission, parenteral drug abuse has become the major documented risk factor in the United States. Health care workers face occupational hazards for HCV infection primarily through needlestick and other contaminated sharps accidents, although the risks are much lower than those historically documented for HBV. Current universal bloodborne precautions for infection control appear to be effective against occupational cross-infection in patient care settings. Ongoing studies in patients with long-term persistent hepatitis C are investigating the usefulness of prolonged interferon therapy to reduce hepatic damage and HCV chronicity."
2530,0.005,1.0000,"Current therapies for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection do not provide adequate long-term control of viral replication in the majority of patients. Monotherapy with nucleoside analogs, such as lamivudine and famciclovir, is effective for short periods but results in the emergence of drug-resistant HBV in a substantial number of patients within 1 year of therapy. Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) has demonstrated clinical activity against wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV, but it is unclear whether resistance mutations will emerge after long-term therapy with this drug. To determine whether extended treatment with ADV led to the emergence of drug-resistant populations of HBV, we analyzed virus isolated from patients currently enrolled in a long-term open-label study. The reverse transcriptase domain of HBV polymerase was amplified and sequenced from patients that had received a cumulative exposure of up to 60 weeks of ADV. During our analyses, several previously unreported amino acid substitutions were observed in the reverse transcriptase domain of HBV. Importantly, none of the observed mutations occurred in more than 1 patient, nor were they associated with an adefovir-resistant phenotype in vitro. Furthermore, none of the patients from whom these mutant viruses were isolated had evidence of virologic rebound. In conclusion, these results, although based on a limited number of patients, suggest that treatment with ADV does not lead to the emergence of resistant virus after up to 60 weeks of therapy."
9997,0.005,1.0000,"Recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the graft is the major problem for patients with chronic HBV infection undergoing liver transplantation, which could be potentiated by the immunosuppression. In the present study, we used lymphocytes and hepatocytes isolated from patients with chronic HBV infection to investigate in vitro the effects of FK506 with and without methylprednisolone (25 ng/mL) on mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell activation marker expression, and HBV replication in human hepatocytes. Increasing concentrations of FK506 (0.1, 0.5, and 5 ng/mL) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation with a reduction of the stimulation index by 9.2%, 39.0%, and 55.1%, respectively, with no difference between 25 chronic HBV carriers and normal controls. Methylprednisolone alone had no effect but potentiated the inhibitory effect of all three FK506 concentrations, such that the stimulation index was decreased by 20%, 56.2%, and 65.7%, respectively. FK506 (0.5 ng/ mL) reduced both the percentage of interleukin-2 receptor expressing T cells and the cell surface density of this receptor by 7.1% and 8.7% (P < .01), whereas it only reduced the proportion of HLA-DR expressing T cells by 6.8%. FK506 did not change significantly the intracellular HBV DNA or the hepatic expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in short-term culture of human hepatocytes, whereas methylprednisolone increased the percentage of HBsAg-positive hepatocytes in all 5 patients with active viral replication. These results indicate that the effects of FK506 on T-cell activation in chronic HBV carriers are identical to normal subjects, resulting in marked suppression of T-lymphocyte function but only modest reduction in the expression of cell surface activation markers. The drug showed no direct stimulatory effect on viral replication, suggesting that FK506 can be a useful, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent for liver graft recipients with chronic HBV infection."
3156,0.005,1.0000,"Many individuals chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) experience a recrudescence of plasma virus during continuous combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) due either to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses or to poor compliance. In most cases, virologic failure on ART is associated with a coincident decline in CD4(+) T lymphocyte levels. However, a proportion of discordant individuals retain a stable or even increasing CD4(+) T lymphocyte count despite virological failure. In order to address the nature of these different outcomes, we evaluated virologic and immunologic variables in a prospective, single-blinded, nonrandomized cohort of 53 subjects with chronic HIV-1 infection who had been treated with continuous ART and monitored intensively over a period of 19 months. In all individuals with detectable viremia on ART, multiple drug resistance mutations with similar impacts on viral growth kinetics were detected in the pol gene of circulating plasma virus. Further, C2V3 env gene analysis demonstrated sequences indicative of CCR5 coreceptor usage in the majority of those with detectable plasma viremia. In contrast to this homogeneous virologic pattern, comprehensive screening with a range of antigens derived from HIV-1 revealed substantial immunologic differences. Discordant subjects with stable CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts in the presence of recrudescent virus demonstrated potent virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. In contrast, subjects with virologic failure associated with declining CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts had substantially weaker HIV-specific CD4(+) T lymphocyte responses and exhibited a trend towards weaker HIV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. Importantly the CD4(+) response was sustained over periods as long as 11 months, confirming the stability of the phenomenon. These correlative data lead to the testable hypothesis that the consequences of viral recrudescence during continuous ART are modulated by the HIV-specific cellular immune response."

A total of 21,198 patients who had infections refractory to zidovudine or who were intolerant of the drug received didanosine as a buffered powder for oral solution (sachet), with total daily doses of 6.6-10 mg/kg; the median CD4 lymphocyte count was 0.04 x 10(9)/L for this population. At the currently recommended dose (6.6-8.29 mg/[kg.d]), 6-month estimated rates of pancreatitis ranged from 1.2% for patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) and CD4 lymphocyte counts of > or = 0.1 x 10(9)/L to 6.7% for patients with AIDS and CD4 lymphocyte counts of < 0.05 x 10(9)/L. Laboratory toxicities of World Health Organization grades 3 and 4 developed in fewer than 4% of patients entering the study with normal baseline values; the sole exception was leukopenia, which was documented in 8% of these patients. The results of this program demonstrated that patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts of < 0.10 x 10(9)/L or with a diagnosis of AIDS (defined by the 1987 classification system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) were less tolerant of didanosine and significantly more likely to develop adverse clinical reactions and myelosuppression than other patients."
8329,0.005,1.0000,"The duration of HIV infection is usually unknown for most patients entering into HIV care. Data on the frequency at which resistance mutations are detected in these patients are needed to support practical guidance on the use of resistance testing in this clinical situation. Furthermore, little is known about HIV subtype diversity in much of the United States. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence of drug resistance mutations and nonsubtype B strains of HIV among antiretroviral-na√Øve individuals presenting for HIV care in New York State between September 2000 and January 2004. Sequences were obtained using a commercial HIV genotyping assay. Seventeen of 151 subjects (11.3%; 95% confidence interval 7.2%-17.3%) had at least one drug-resistance mutation, including 5 subjects with fewer than 200 CD4(+) T cells, indicative of advanced infection. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor resistance mutations were detected in 6.6%, 5.3%, and 0.7% of subjects, respectively. Subjects from New York City-based clinics were less likely to have resistant virus than subjects from clinics elsewhere in New York State. Nonsubtype B strains of HIV were detected in 9 (6.0%) individuals and were associated with heterosexual contact. Two nonsubtype B strains from this cohort also carried drug-resistance mutations. These data indicate that drug-resistant virus is frequently detected in antiretroviral-na√Øve individuals entering HIV care in New York State. Furthermore, a diverse set of nonsubtype B strains were identified and evidence suggests that nonsubtype B strains, including those carrying drug-resistance mutations, are being transmitted in New York State."
6301,0.005,1.0000,"Most human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals show evidence of infection by only one strain of the virus despite possible frequent contact with multiple strains. The reason(s) for the emergence of a dominant strain of virus in HIV-infected people and the mechanism(s) which prevent other strains from establishing an infection is not known. In the present study, we demonstrate that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals can resist productive infection by HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains. Although the PBMC of these individuals are resistant to superinfection, their CD4+ cells are susceptible to infection. Moreover, two weeks after infection of their PBMC in culture, the superinfecting virus can be recovered from isolated CD4+ cells. When CD8+ cells from asymptomatic individuals are added to the superinfected CD4+ cells, replication of the exogenously introduced virus is inhibited. In contrast, PBMC from individuals who have progressed to disease (Progressors) do not resist superinfection and their CD8+ cells do not showthe antiviral activity which controls productive HIV infection. These findings suggest that CD8+ cells suppressing HIV replication in infected individuals may be critical in preventing the establishment of infection by other strains of HIV by blocking virus replication."
7480,0.005,1.0000,"Individuals presenting consecutively with genital ulcers in Kingston, Jamaica, underwent serological testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, chlamydial infection, and syphilis. Ulcer material was analyzed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) analysis. DNA from herpes simplex virus (HSV), Haemophilus ducreyi, and Treponema pallidum was detected in 158 (52.0%), 72 (23.7%), and 31 (10.2%) of 304 ulcer specimens. Of the 304 subjects, 67 (22%) were HIV-seropositive and 64 (21%) were T. pallidum-seroreactive. Granuloma inguinale was clinically diagnosed in nine (13.4%) of 67 ulcers negative by M-PCR analysis and in 12 (5.1%) of 237 ulcers positive by M-PCR analysis (P = .03). Lymphogranuloma venereum was clinically diagnosed in eight patients. Compared with M-PCR analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of a clinical diagnosis of syphilis, herpes, and chancroid were 67.7%, 53.8%, and 75% and 91.2%, 83.6%, and 75.4%, respectively. Reactive syphilis serology was 74% sensitive and 85% specific compared with M-PCR analysis. Reported contact with a prostitute in the preceding 3 months was associated with chancroid (P = .009), reactive syphilis serology (P = .011), and HIV infection (P = .007). The relatively poor accuracy of clinical and locally available laboratory diagnoses pleads for syndromic management of genital ulcers in Jamaica. Prevention efforts should be intensified."
8385,0.005,1.0000,"Over 1 million people in the United States are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which may progress to AIDS. The use of antiviral therapy has successfully controlled the rate of viral growth in patients. Antiviral agents improve the quality of life and reduce the potential for spreading HIV; HIV is currently considered a chronic disease provided patients are compliant with their antiviral medications. Tenofovir is a nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor that prevents viral replication and is approved for treatment of HIV and chronic hepatitis B infection. Tenofovir is an antiretroviral drug used alone and in combination with other nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor agents to lower viral load in HIV patients. Tenofovir is administered as a prodrug to increase bioavailability. The prodrug forms of tenofovir are tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, approved in 2001, and tenofovir alafenamide, approved in 2016. Tenofovir is extensively used in controlling HIV, as it is administered once daily, allowing for good compliance. This minireview discusses the impact of food, age, and drug transporters on tenofovir absorption and clearance. The changes in dosing that are needed in the presence of renal impairment, which is a common occurrence with HIV chronic disease progression, will also be discussed. The potential special conditions occurring with fixed-combination doses containing tenofovir will also be reviewed, including the use of cobicistat, a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor. The short review also addresses some newer preparations using niosomes to improve tenofovir absorption and delivery to the target cells."
4240,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral treatment is compromised by viral resistance mutations. Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is therefore monitored closely, but follow-up studies of these patients are limited. Virus from 1405 individuals diagnosed with HIV-1 in Denmark between 2001 and 2009 was analyzed for TDR, and molecular-epidemiological links and progression of the infection were described based on data from standardized questionnaires, the prospective Danish HIV Cohort Study, and by phylogenetic analysis. Eighty-five individuals were found to be infected with virus harboring mutations resulting in a prevalence of 6.1%, with no changes over time. The main resistance mutations were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation 215 revertants, as well as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation 103N/S and protease inhibitor (PI) mutations 90M and 85V. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed 12 transmission chains involving 37 TDR individuals. Of these 21 were also documented epidemiologically. The virus included in the transmission chain carried similar resistance mutations to the TDR index case, whereas controls chains from index cases without TDR were generally without resistance mutations. We observed no difference in progression of the infection between individuals infected with TDR and individuals infected with wild-type HIV-1. The prevalence of TDR is low in Denmark and transmission of dual-drug-resistant HIV-1 is infrequent. The TDR isolates were shown to originate from local patients failing therapy."
6934,0.005,1.0000,"Recent findings have indicated that megakaryocytes may be susceptible to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, suggesting a potential role for megakaryocytes as viral reservoirs in HIV-infected patients. We report that the megakaryocytic cell line Dami could be productively infected with the HTLV III-B strain of HIV-1, in 26 different experiments (results of 16 experiments are reported); productive infection lasted up to 30 weeks. Despite a lack of detectable surface expression of the CD4 molecule and very low levels of CD4 mRNA, between 40% and 60% of megakaryocytic cells produced viral proteins after contact with HIV-1. Neither cytopathogenic effects nor syncytial formation was observed. Production of high levels of functional viral particles was indicated by analysis of p24 protein levels, reverse transcriptase activity, ultrastructural studies, and the capacity of supernatants from infected Dami cells to infect the Molt-4 T-lymphocytic cell line. HIV-1 RNA and protein levels in infected Dami cells were enhanced by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and decreased by treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-gamma. Transient transfection of the megakaryocytic cells with various constructs of the HIV-1 promoter (LTR) linked to the luciferase reporter gene suggested that the effect of TNF-alpha was related, as in monocytic and T-cell lines, to transactivation of the enhancer region of the HIV-1 LTR. These findings indicate that signals provided by the immune system may modulate HIV-1 expression in cells of the megakaryocytic lineage."
4233,0.005,1.0000,"In order to assess the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance mutation profiles and evaluate the distribution of the genetic subtypes in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, blood samples from 547 HIV-1 infected patients failing antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, were collected during the years 2002 and 2003 to perform the viral resistance genotyping at the Renageno Laboratory from Rio de Janeiro (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation). Viral resistance genotyping was performed using ViroSeq Genotyping System (Celera Diagnostic-Abbott, US). The HIV-1 subtyping based on polymerase (pol) gene sequences (protease and reverse transcriptase-RT regions) was as follows: subtype B (91.2%), subtype F (4.9%), and B/F viral recombinant forms (3.3%). The subtype C was identified in two patients (0.4%) and the recombinant CRF_02/AG virus was found infecting one patient (0.2%). The HIV-1 genotyping profile associated to the reverse transcriptase inhibitors has shown a high frequency of the M184V mutation followed by the timidine-associated mutations. The K103N mutation was the most prevalent to the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor and the resistance associated to protease inhibitor showed the minor mutations L63P, L10F/R, and A71V as the more prevalent. A large proportion of subtype B was observed in HIV-1 treated patients from Rio de Janeiro. In addition, we have identified the circulation of drug-resistant HIV-1 subtype C and are presenting the first report of the occurrence of an African recombinant CRF_02/AG virus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A clear association between HIV-1 subtypes and protease resistance mutations was observed in this study. The maintenance of resistance genotyping programs for HIV-1 failing patients is important to the management of ARV therapies and to attempt and monitor the HIV-1 subtype prevalence in Brazil."
424,0.005,1.0000,"Genotypic testing using TRUGENE was performed for treatment-naive, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients at baseline and after initiation of protease inhibitor (PI)-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens. The genetic diversity of HIV-1 pol sequences from 92 CRF01_AE and 21 B strains was compared. Subsequently, the impact of polymorphism on resistance to therapy was studied in CRF01_AE-infected (n=29) and subtype B-infected (n=14) patients. At baseline, the differences between CRF01_AE and B strain were mainly observed in the minor mutations L10I/V, M36I and L63P/I/H (P<0.001, chi(2)). In the reverse transcriptase sequence, M41L and T215Y/S were more common in patients infected with subtype B virus (P<0.05, chi(2)). Although all patients treated with PI-based HAART had pre-existing minor mutations, a low prevalence of resistance to PIs was observed (5/43; 11.6%). Moreover, major mutations (D30N and N88D) conferring resistance to PIs were found in patients infected with subtype B strain. In conclusion, polymorphisms at the protease region may not reduce PI susceptibility during treatment. However, this study also revealed the difference in natural mutations among subtypes, which may affect the manifestation of drug resistance."

Participants completed a patient satisfaction survey following the 12 part intervention consisting of seven groups and five individual sessions. A feedback questionnaire was also completed during each group session to gain more insight on participant experiences. Several indicators suggested high levels of satisfaction. First, overall attendance was relatively high. Second, participants rated their subjective experience and group content favorably. No differences in satisfaction ratings emerged between perinatally infected adolescents and those who acquired HIV through risk behaviors. However, differences emerged regarding perceived intervention utility and content-specific preferences. Findings suggest that Adolescent Impact participants were satisfied with the intervention and that a heterogeneous group of HIV-infected youth could be advantageously integrated into the same secondary prevention program."
398,0.005,1.0000,"Unmet needs for services, such as housing and psychiatric treatment, are relatively common among HIV-infected individuals; however, the effects of different types of unmet needs on health-care outcomes are not well understood. This study describes unmet psychosocial needs and their relationship with health-care outcomes among individuals receiving HIV care in the southeastern US (n=526). We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association of seven categories of unmet needs with HIV medication use and adherence. Most participants (84.5%) reported at least one service need in the past year. Nearly half (47%) of participants with service needs reported that at least one need was not met. Participants with one or more unmet needs were less likely to be taking any HIV medications (p = 0.007) and reported poorer medication adherence (p=0.013). The specific unmet needs for benefits (including Social Security, health insurance and prescription coverage) (p = 0.006) and a support group (p=0.040) were associated with being less likely to be taking any HIV medications. Unmet need for mental health-related counseling was associated with poorer medication adherence (p=0.003). Study findings regarding the high level of unmet need and the association of unmet need with poorer outcomes illustrate the importance of interventions to address these needs."
4015,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant worldwide health care problem. Nearly one-third of all patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are coinfected with HCV. Compared with HIV-monoinfected persons, coinfected individuals experience more rapid progression of fibrosis and higher incidence of cirrhosis and death as a result of liver disease. Treatment for HCV infection includes ribavirin (RBV) plus interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) or pegylated IFN, a combination treatment associated with anemia that may require RBV dose reduction or discontinuation. IFN-RBV-associated anemia is more profound among coinfected patients, who have a high prevalence of pretreatment anemia and may also be taking other medications causing anemia. Epoetin alfa administration to HCV-infected patients with IFN-RBV-related anemia can significantly increase hemoglobin levels and maintain significantly higher RBV doses compared with patients treated with RBV dose reduction alone. Higher RBV doses and adherence to HCV therapy have been associated with higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates. Maintenance of RBV dose with epoetin alfa may improve adherence, thereby affecting SVR."
3791,0.005,1.0000,"OBJECTIVE. To serially evaluate the viral kinetics of occult hepatitis B virus infection in lymphoma patients and perform a correlation with clinical outcomes. DESIGN. Case series with 1-year follow-up. SETTING. Regional hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS. Consecutive patients who were newly diagnosed to have lymphoma in the hospital between 1 April 2007 and 31 March 2008 were tested for hepatitis B (HB) surface (s) antigen (Ag), anti-HBs antibody (Ab) and anti-HB core (c) Ab. Seropositive occult hepatitis B patients as defined by being negative for HBsAg but positive anti-HBsAb and/or anti-HBcAb without a hepatitis B vaccination history were recruited. Serum HBsAg, anti-HBsAb, anti-HBcAb, hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level, and liver biochemistry were checked at baseline and every 4 weeks during and after chemotherapy until 12 months after the completion of chemotherapy or death. Entecavir was started if patients developed biochemical flare-up of hepatitis B associated with virological rebound. The prevalence and course of hepatitis B virus-related hepatitis, as well as any temporal relationship to viral kinetics and clinical hepatitis, were assessed. RESULTS. Of 47 patients tested, 10 (21%) with lymphoma were seropositive occult hepatitis carriers. Their median baseline hepatitis B virus DNA level was 89 IU/mL (range, <34-807 IU/mL). Virological rebound (as defined by a 10-fold increase in serum hepatitis B virus DNA level from pre-chemotherapy level persisted for 4 weeks) occurred in one of the 10 patients, followed by biochemical reactivation. Whereupon entecavir treatment was started and no liver failure ensued. Regarding the other seropositive occult patients, their serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels fluctuated, but there was no associated biochemical reactivation. CONCLUSION. Detectable baseline serum hepatitis B virus DNA is not uncommon in patients with occult hepatitis B who receive chemotherapy. Transient elevation in serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels does not predict biochemical reactivation, but antiviral treatment might be considered if virological rebound persists."

Thirty-seven interferon-naive patients underwent liver biopsy. HCV-induced activity (A) and fibrosis (F) were evaluated with METAVIR score. The 37 patients included had HIV plasma loads < 10,000 copies/ml, CD4(+) count > 250/microl. All the patients but two were receiving antiretroviral treatment. Liver tissue and sera were used for measurement of HCV RNA by the Cobas Amplicor HCV Monitor. All patients had serum and liver HCV RNA, and both levels were correlated (r = 0.47; P = 0.003). Intrahepatic HCV load did not depend on age, sex, duration of HCV infection, CD4(+), HCV genotype, or fibrosis. AST levels correlated with intrahepatic HCV load (r = 0.52; P = 0.001). Patients with METAVIR A1/A2 had significantly lower levels of liver HCV-RNA than were found in patients with METAVIR A3 (P = 0.026). Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) including protease inhibitors(PI)-treated patients had significantly lower intrahepatic HCV load (P = 0.04). A weak but significant correlation between serum and liver HCV RNA was found. The amount of hepatic HCV RNA was correlated with AST levels, histological activity, but not with HCV genotype or fibrosis. The immune improvement associated with PI regimens could help reduce HCV load, supporting a protective effect of PI-induced immune restoration."

This multicentre study reports retrospectively the long-term efficacy and safety data with tenofovir DF treatment in nucleosid(t)e-naive, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B patients. Thirty-one patients (11 females, 20 males) received 245 mg tenofovir DF per diem. All patients' initial serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels were over 2,000 IU/ml. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, HBeAg, hepatitis B e antibodies (anti-HBe), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibodies (Anti-HBs), HBV DNA, creatinine and urea levels were evaluated at baseline, and at weeks 12, 24, 48 and 96 during therapy. Thirty-one patients completed 96 weeks of treatment. Mean age was 37.6 ¬± 9.4 years. The initial mean value of ALT was 79 ¬± 39.9 IU/L. At baseline, mean of fibrosis (Ishak) of liver biopsies was 2.3 ¬± 0.7. Two of the patients (5.9%) achieved HBV DNA less than 300 copies at week 12 of treatment and 97.1 % at week 96. HBeAg loss was observed in 6.7% of patients. At week 96, HBsAg loss was not observed in any of the patients. Mean ALT at week 48 was 32.7 U/L, at week 96 32.6 U/L. Renal safety was good.

Thirty-four consecutive patients with HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive/anti-HCV-positive chronic hepatitis were retrospectively enrolled at their first liver biopsy (LB). For all patients, a documented clinical, serological and virological follow-up of at least 3 years (range 3-16 years) after LB and a sample of whole blood for genetic evaluation were available. Of the 24 patients with detectable serum HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA at their first observation, three cleared both HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA, 12 HCV-RNA and five HBV-DNA. Of the seven HBV DNA-positive/HCV RNA-negative patients at enrolment, three cleared HBV-DNA and one remained HBV DNA-positive and became HCV RNA-positive. All three HBV DNA-negative/HCV RNA-positive patients remained unchanged. Compared with the 12 patients with HCV persistence, the 15 patients who cleared HCV were younger, had lower serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HCV load, and histological activity index (HAI) and fibrosis score, more frequently had IL28-B CC variant, had been receiving an interferon-based treatment and less frequently cleared serum HBV-DNA. To investigate the relationship between the IL28-B variants and clearance of HCV, excluding the confounding effect of interferon-based treatment, the Mantel-Haenszel test was used, which indicated an association between HCV clearance and IL28-B variants (p = 0.009). In chronic HBV/HCV coinfection, a long-term follow-up showed a frequent spontaneous or treatment-related clearance of active replication of one or both viruses and identified the IL28-B CC genotype as an independent predictor of HCV clearance."
4606,0.005,1.0000,"Worldwide viral hepatitis is the most common cause of jaundice, chronic liver disease cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. While important advances have been made in prevention of viral hepatitis, therapy of this disease remains unsatisfactory. There are no specific therapies of proven benefit for acute hepatitis, although use of alpha-interferon during the acute phase of hepatitis C may result in a decrease in the rate of chronicity. For chronic viral hepatitis, alpha-interferon has been widely used, but is expensive, poorly tolerated and limited in effectiveness. New antiviral agents and use of combinations of antivirals are now being evaluated and promise to provide a therapy that is effective in the majority of patients. The currently recommended therapy of chronic hepatitis B is a 4- to 6-month course of alpha-interferon in doses of 5-10 million units three times a week; a regimen that results in sustained clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) from serum in approximately one-third and a loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in one-tenth of patients. Long-term follow-up of patients who respond to interferon treatment with clearance of HBeAg indicate that the majority ultimately clear HBsAg as well and have continued remission in the liver disease, although low levels of HBV DNA can commonly be detected in liver tissue. Better therapies of hepatitis B are needed. Recently, several oral 'second-generation' nucleoside analogues have been developed that have potent activity against HBV. The best studied is lamivudine (3-thiacytidine) which results in marked inhibition of HBV DNA levels and improvement in serum aminotransferases and hepatic histology in the majority of patients. When stopped, however, most patients relapse and the shortcomings of long-term therapy have been the development of viral resistance in up to one-quarter of patients within a year and a higher percentage with more prolonged therapy. Future approaches of therapy of promise for hepatitis B are combinations of lamivudine with interferon and other antiviral nucleoside analogues. The currently recommended therapy of chronic hepatitis C is a 12- to 18-month course of alpha interferon in doses of 3 million units three times a week: a regimen that results in sustained clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in approximately 20% of patients. Sustained responses have been associated with marked improvements in hepatic histology and long-term studies indicate that the majority of patients remain free of virus in serum and liver, suggesting a 'cure' of infection. Responses to interferon correlate to some degree with clinical and virological features, including young age, absence of hepatic fibrosis, low levels of HCV RNA in serum and HCV genotypes 2 and 3.

4372,0.005,1.0000,"The routes of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus transmission are quite similar and coexistence of both viruses in one patient is not a rare phenomenon. Until now, the natural course of liver diseases induced by coinfections has not been well documented and the mechanisms of interaction between the two viruses and the human host have not been fully clarified. We report the case of a patient suffering from chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus who developed an acute hepatitis B virus superinfection. Serum hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid became undetectable by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction at diagnosis of acute hepatitis B virus infection. At the same time, there was a striking increase in the serum concentrations of the antibodies against C22 and C33c hepatitis C virus antigens. Four months after clinical resolution of the acute hepatitis, hepatitis B surface antigen was undetectable in serum and three months later antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen appeared. Two years after acute hepatitis B virus infection, the patient has had no relapse of markers for viral replication of hepatitis B virus. Transaminases are within the reference range and hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid is undetectable in both serum and liver tissue. We hypothesize that acute hepatitis B virus infection stimulated a specific humoral response against hepatitis C virus as well as triggering non-specific defense mechanisms which finally eliminated both viruses."

The association of leprosy with HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) was assessed using a seroprevalence study and 191 leprosy outpatients were included. Demographic data and the clinical classification of leprosy were recorded. Evidence of previous HBV infection was present in 53 patients (27.7%, 95% confidence interval: 21.9-34.5) and two (1%) were HBsAg positive. Five (2.6%) had antibodies to HCV. The prevalence of previous exposure to HBV was higher than expected for an adult population in central Brazil. In contrast, the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies was not much higher regarding the age range of participants. HBV markers were associated with a higher number of sex partners and the use of injections without proper sterilisation of the syringes. The number of HBV carriers was small, suggesting that there was no increased likelihood of chronification among these patients."

Common sites of EPTB were pleural cavity 80 (44%), lymph node 31 (17%) and 30 (16.5%) abdomen. Of the 300 TB patients tested for HIV, 175 (58.3%) were HIV-infected and 97 (55.4%) of these were already on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at time of admission. Overall, 104 (26.9%) of the TB patients admitted died. About two thirds of patients who died had PTB. About three quarters (73.1%; N=283) of the patients were discharged home to continue with anti-TB treatment. There was significantly higher proportion of deaths among HIV-infected TB patients (29.1% versus 15.2%) than in the HIV uninfected TB patients (P=0.005). Age was a significant predictor for PTB (OR 0.946, 95% CI 0.917-0.976) while age (OR 1.019, 95% CI 1.002-1.036) and HIV serostatus (OR 2.143, 95% CI 1.313-3.497) were significant risk factors for EPTB. It is concluded that more than half of the patients had PTB and pleural cavity was the most common site of EPTB. TB-HIV co-infected patients had significantly higher mortality than the TB-HIV- uninfected patients. It is recommended to emphasize on the provision of HIV counselling and testing to all TB patients to ensure proper management and timely initiation of ART in TB-HIV co-infected patients in order to improve the outcome and reduce mortality."
5566,0.005,1.0000,"Early studies of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use in clinical practice suggested suboptimal rates of viral suppression. HAART regimens and expertise in the use of HAART have since evolved, and we sought to determine how virologic response to HAART has changed in clinical practice. We compared all patients who started a first HAART regimen from 1996 through 2002 in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected patients in care in Baltimore. There were significant improvements in suppressing HIV RNA to < 400 copies/mL, ranging from 43.8% (1996) to 72.4% (2001-2002) by 6 months and from 60.1% (1996) to 79.9% (2001-2002) by 12 months (both P < 0.01 for trend). There were also significant improvements in CD4 cell response. Over time, there was a significant increase in the use of a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen compared with a single PI as well as an increase in the number of patients who were antiretroviral (ARV) naive. There was also a significant temporal trend from 1996 through 2002 in achieving a suppressed HIV RNA level, adjusting for being ARV naive, specific HAART regimen, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, and demographic factors. This suggests that improved virologic response may also be attributable to other factors such as a greater focus on medication adherence, improved ARV tolerability, and ease of dosing."
1965,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B infection remains a major public health problem worldwide. The hepatitis B virus belongs to the family of hepadnaviruses that replicate their DNA genome via a reverse transcription pathway. The chronicity of infection in infected hepatocytes is maintained by the persistence of the viral covalently closed circular DNA. The main strategies to combat chronic HBV infection rely on the stimulation of the specific antiviral immune response and on the inhibition of viral replication. While the prolonged administration of reverse transcriptase inhibitors is most often associated with a control of viral replication rather than eradication, it may select for resistant mutants. The search for new viral targets is therefore mandatory to design combination strategies to prevent the emergence of resistant mutants and eventually clear viral infection."

We studied these factors and the evolution of HIV-1 resistance in response to LPV/r in a prospective study of patients receiving LPV/r under a temporary authorization in Bordeaux, France. HIV-1 PR and reverse transcriptase sequences were determined at baseline LPV/r for all the patients and at month 3 (M3) and M6 in the absence of response to treatment. pK measurements were determined at M1 and M3. Virological failure (VF) was defined as a plasma viral load >or=400 copies/ml at M3. A multivariate analysis of the predictors of VF, including clinical and biological characteristics and the treatment history of the patients, was performed. The PR gene sequence at M0, including individual mutations or a previously defined LPV mutation score (D. J. Kempf, J. D. Isaacson, M. S. King, S. C. Brun, Y. Xu, K. Real, B. M. Bernstein, A. J. Japour, E. Sun, and R. A. Rode, J. Virol. 75:7262-7269, 2001), and the individual exposure to LPV were also included covariates. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled. Thirty-four percent had a virological response at M3. An LPV mutation score of >5 mutations, the presence of the PR I54V mutation at baseline, a high number of previous PIs, prior therapy with ritonavir or indinavir, absence of coprescription of efavirenz, and a lower exposure to LPV or lower LPV trough concentrations were independently associated with VF on LPV/r. Additional PI resistance mutations, including primary mutation I50V, could be selected in patients failing on LPV/r. Genotypic and pK parameters should be used to optimize the virological response to LPV/r in PI-experienced patients and to avoid further viral evolution."
9291,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection during the clinical latency phase with drugs inhibiting reverse transcriptase (RT) reduces the HIV-1 RNA load and increases the CD4+ T-cell count. Typically, however, the virus evolves mutations in the RT gene that circumvent the drugs. We develop a mathematical model for this situation. The model distinguishes quiescent from activated CD4+ T cells, incorporates the fact that only activated cells can become productively infected by HIV-1, embodies empirical estimates for the drug resistance and the mutation frequency for each of the HIV-1 drug-resistant mutants, and assumes the antiviral immune response to remain constant over the course of the experiments. We analyze clinical data on the evolution of drug-resistant mutants for the RT inhibitors lamivudine and zidovudine. The results show that the evolutionary sequence of the drug-resistant mutants in both data sets is accounted for by our model, given that lamivudine is more effective than zidovudine. Thus, current empirical estimates of the mutation frequencies and the drug resistances of the mutants suffice for explaining the data. We derive a critical treatment level below which the wild-type HIV-1 RNA load can rebound before the first drug-resistant mutant appears. Our zidovudine data confirm this to be the case. Thus, we demonstrate in the model and the data that the rebound of the HIV-1 RNA load in the case of zidovudine is due to the outgrowth of wild-type virus and the first drug-resistant mutant, whereas that in the case of lamivudine can only be due to the drug-resistant mutants. The evolution of drug resistance proceeds slower in the case of zidovudine because (i) zidovudine is not as effective as lamivudine and (ii) the first zidovudine drug-resistant mutant is competing with the rebounding wild-type virus."
1083,0.005,1.0000,"Although therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection has delivered remarkable cure rates, curative therapies for hepatitis B virus (HBV) may only be available in the distant future. The possibility to eliminate or at least stably maintain low levels of HBV replication under the control of a functional anti-host response has stimulated the development of specific immunotherapies for HBV infection. We reviewed the development of T-cell therapy for HBV, highlighting its potential antiviral efficiency but also its potential toxicities in different groups of chronic HBV patients. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are the only two communicable diseases in which there have been increases in related morbidity and mortality over the past 20 years [1]. Both viruses are chronically infecting about 500 million people (HBV ~350 million, HCV ~150 million) and represent the seventh most frequent cause of death worldwide [1]. HBV and HCV are hepatotropic, non-cytopathic viruses able to establish persistent infections that cause different degrees of hepatic inflammation (chronic hepatitis), leading to the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The two viruses are unrelated and virologically different. HCV remains prevalent in North America and Europe, whereas chronic hepatitis B is prevalent in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [1,2]. HCV is an RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, and HBV is a DNA virus of the Hepadnaviridae family and uses reverse transcriptase to synthesize its DNA from a pre-genomic RNA form [3]. HCV is able to activate in the infected host a classical type I interferon (IFN)-mediated innate response [3], whereas HBV generally escapes innate immune recognition and does not activate type I IFN-mediated immunity. Chronic HBV and HCV infections are both characterized by quantitative and functional defects of virus-specific T-cell response [4,5]. The frequency of virus-specific T cells is extremely low, and virus-specific T cells show features of exhaustion in both chronic HBV and HCV patients [6]. However, the quantitative and functional defects are more pronounced in HBV infections, with T cells virtually undetectable in the blood of many chronic HBV patients by ex vivo analysis [7-9]. In addition, while frequency and impact of viral mutations in T cell epitopes are frequently detectable in HCV infections [10], viral mutations affecting CD8 T-cell epitopes are scarcer in chronic HBV patients [6,11,12]. Of extreme practical importance in relation to the potential impact of T-cell therapy for HBV and HCV are the efficacies of currently available treatments. New therapies for HCV have delivered remarkable cure rates, with more than 90% of patients achieving viral clearance with all oral direct-acting antivirals [13]. In contrast, curative therapies for HBV will not be available until the distant future (14). Thus, although it is difficult to see a possible therapeutic advantage of a new T-cell-based therapy in chronic HCV patients, the fact that current therapies for HBV only partially suppress but do not eliminate HBV from the infected host has encouraged research for new and more radical therapies designed to eliminate or at least stably maintain low levels of HBV replication under the control of a functional anti-host response. For these reasons, in this review, we concentrate on the development of T-cell therapy for HBV. T-cell therapy for HCV chronic infection is certainly important for understanding the mechanisms of T-cell antiviral control [15,16], but their use for therapy appears unlikely."
7609,0.005,1.0000,"Opportunistic diseases cause substantial morbidity and mortality to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) leading to immune reconstitution is the most effective treatment of preventing opportunistic diseases. This retrospective study established an epidemiologic profile of opportunistic diseases 10 years after the introduction of HAART. The HIV antiretroviral therapy-naive patients matching inclusion criteria were included. The primary outcome was the prevalence of opportunistic diseases. From January 1, 2002 to September 30, 2010, 654 opportunistic diseases were identified in 458 patients. Pulmonary tuberculosis, herpes zoster, cerebral toxoplasmosis, oral candidiasis, and severe pneumonia accounted for 22.05%, 15.94%, 14.19%, 14.19%, and 9.39%, respectively. Cryptococcal meningitis and pneumocystosis accounted for 0.44% and 0.21%, respectively. The prevalence of opportunistic diseases in Gabon remains high. New guidelines emphasize the importance of initiating antiretroviral therapy early to reconstitute the immune system, and reduce disease risk, and treat the primary opportunistic infection of pulmonary tuberculosis."

Recently, the shock and kill strategy, by which such reservoirs are eradicated following reactivation of latent HIV-1 by latency-reversing agents (LRAs), has been extensively practiced. It is important to reestablish virus-specific and reliable immune surveillance to eradicate the reactivated virus-harboring cells. In this report, we attempted to reach this goal by using newly developed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell technology. To generate anti-HIV-1 CAR-T cells, we connected the single-chain variable fragment of the broadly neutralizing HIV-1-specific antibody VRC01 to a third-generation CAR moiety as the extracellular and intracellular domains and subsequently transduced this into primary CD8"
5365,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a rare B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with poor prognosis. Lymphoma cells are always infected with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) and in most cases coinfected with Epstein-Barr virus. In classic presentation, PEL is characterized by body cavity effusions with or without mass lesions. A variant with only extracavitary localization has also been described. We report on a large single-center series of patients with PEL in the era of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). The main objective was to compare the characteristics and the outcome of patients with classic (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ34) and extracavitary (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ17) variant PEL. At PEL diagnosis, no major difference was observed between the two groups in terms of demographic and HIV characteristics. Extracavitary localizations were exclusively nodal in six patients and involved various organs in 11 patients. Another HHV-8-associated disease was observed in 31 patients, Kaposi sarcoma in 25, and multicentric Castleman disease in 18 patients, without difference between the two groups. Thirty-two patients were treated with CHOP associated with high-dose methotrexate, 13 were treated with CHOP-derived regimen alone, and six patients received low-dose/no chemotherapy. Complete remission was achieved in 21 (62%) and seven (41%) patients of the classic and extracavitary groups, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) was 10.2 months. Despite a higher disease-free survival in the extracavitary group, there was no difference in OS between the two variants. Based on this series, characteristics of classic and extracavitary variants were very close. Although prognosis of PEL remains very severe in cART era, the median survival compares favorably with earlier series."
7955,0.005,1.0000,"The outcome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is related to the set-point plasma virus load (pVL) that emerges after primary HIV-1 infection (PHI). This set-point pVL generally remains stable but eventually increases with progression to disease. However, the events leading to loss of viremic control are poorly understood. Here, we describe an individual who presented with symptomatic PHI and subsequently progressed rapidly, after an initial period of 1 year during which viral replication was well controlled. Escalation of viral replication in this atypical case was preceded by the emergence of escape variants in many epitopes targeted by dominant CD8+ T cell responses and a marked decrease in HIV-1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell frequencies. There were no changes in viral tropism, replication kinetics, or neutralizing antibody titers. These findings demonstrate the temporal relationship between viral escape from CD8+ T cell activity, decrease in HIV-1-specific T cell frequencies, and loss of control of viral replication."

Patients with AIDS or two CD4 counts of < or = 300 who fulfilled specific criteria for zidovudine intolerance or failure were randomized to receive either 500 mg didanosine (ddl) daily or 2.25 mg zalcitabine (ddC) per day. Absolute CD4 counts were recorded at study entry and at as many as four visits. Patients were followed for clinical disease progression and survival. At 2 months, the difference in mean CD4 count from baseline was +15.4 cells/mm3 in the ddI group but -1.3 cells/mm3 in the ddC group. Patients assigned to ddI had a greater chance of a CD4 response at 2 months than those on ddC, yet only those in the ddC group with a response showed significant improvement in progression of disease or survival compared with ddC nonresponders, ddI responders, and ddI nonresponders (p = 0.03). We conclude that a CD4 response does not necessarily correlate with improved outcome and is therefore not a useful surrogate marker in these patients."
7738,0.005,1.0000,"The retroviral primary transcription product is a multifunctional RNA that is utilized as pre-mRNA, mRNA, and genomic RNA. The relationship between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) unspliced transcripts used as mRNA for viral protein synthesis and as virion precursor RNA (vpRNA) for encapsidation remains an important question. We developed a biochemical assay to evaluate the hypothesis that prior utilization as mRNA template for protein synthesis is necessary to generate vpRNA. HIV-1-infected T cells were treated with translation inhibitors under conditions that maintain virus production. Immunoprecipitation of newly synthesized HIV-1 Gag protein revealed that de novo translation is not necessary to sustain assembly, release, or processing of Gag structural protein. Both newly synthesized protein and steady-state Gag are competent for assembly, and the extracellular accumulation of Gag is proportional to the intracellular abundance of Gag. As early as 2 h after transcription, newly synthesized RNA is detectable in cell-free virions and encapsidation is sustained upon inhibition of host cell translation. Results of both [(3)H]uridine incorporation assays and HIV-1-specific RNase protection assays (RPAs) indicate that translation inhibition reduces the absolute amounts of both cytoplasmic and virion-associated RNA. Evaluation of encapsidation efficiency by RPA revealed that the cytoplasmic availability of vpRNA is increased, indicating that HIV-1 unspliced mRNA can be rerouted to function as vpRNA. Our data contrast with results from the HIV-2 and murine leukemia virus systems and indicate that HIV-1 unspliced RNA constitutes a single functional pool that can function interchangeably as mRNA and as vpRNA."

The goal of this study was to compare survival durations of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected IDUs for the period 1987-2004.Methods. Demographic data, drug use characteristics, and biological markers were obtained at the time of admission to a substance abuse treatment program. The outcome of interest was the duration of survival after admission, and the primary exposure was HIV infection. Vital status was ascertained by means of the mortality register by the end of 2004. Three calendar periods, which were defined on the basis of use of specific therapies, were considered: 1987-1991 (the antiretroviral monotherapy era), 1992-1996 (the dual combination therapy era and the era when methadone was introduced in Spain), and 1997-2004 (the era of HAART and of established methadone programs). We used Cox regression methods allowing for late entries to handle the contribution of persons who survived a given period and entered the following period with nonzero time.

8063,0.005,1.0000,"A quantitative rapid assay to detect resistant clinical human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains remains an important medical goal. A system incorporating a quantitative RNA.RNA hybridization assay that measures the amount of intracellular HIV-1-specific RNA has been employed to detect the level of inhibition by nucleoside analogues in sensitive and resistant HIV-1 strains. The RNA.RNA hybridization assay readily distinguished previously published zidovudine (ZDV; 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine)-resistant isolates from ZDV-sensitive isolates of HIV-1. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ZDV for HTLV-IIIB and sensitive clinical HIV-1 isolates is between 0.01 and 0.04 microM. HIV-1 strains from three patients on long-term ZDV therapy displayed a greater than 20-fold increase in the ZDV IC50 compared to sensitive strains. The drug sensitivity system was confirmed by showing that mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase gene from a ZDV-resistant isolate resulted in four amino acid changes (Leu-125----Trp, Ile-142----Val, Thr-215----Tyr, and Pro-294----Thr) including one change (Thr-215----Tyr) that has been previously reported to be associated with resistance. One clinical HIV strain with high-level ZDV resistance displayed a 5-fold increase in 2',3'-dideoxyinosine IC50 compared to that of HTLV-IIIB. A drug sensitivity assay employing RNA.RNA hybridization may be useful for extensive screening of HIV isolates from patients enrolled in clinical trials and permit the correlation of in vitro resistance with clinical outcome."
8160,0.005,1.0000,"The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is a mammalian host restriction factor that inhibits the replication of a variety of RNA viruses, including retroviruses, alphaviruses and filoviruses, through interaction with the ZAP-responsive elements (ZRE) in viral RNA, and recruiting the exosome to degrade RNA substrate. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a pararetrovirus that replicates its genomic DNA via reverse transcription of a viral pregenomic (pg) RNA precursor. Here, we demonstrate that the two isoforms of human ZAP (hZAP-L and -S) inhibit HBV replication in human hepatocyte-derived cells through posttranscriptional down-regulation of viral pgRNA. Mechanistically, the zinc finger motif-containing N-terminus of hZAP is responsible for the reduction of HBV RNA, and the integrity of the four zinc finger motifs is essential for ZAP to bind to HBV RNA and fulfill its antiviral function. The ZRE sequences conferring the susceptibility of viral RNA to ZAP-mediated RNA decay were mapped to the terminal redundant region (nt 1820-1918) of HBV pgRNA. In agreement with its role as a host restriction factor and as an innate immune mediator for HBV infection, ZAP was upregulated in cultured primary human hepatocytes and hepatocyte-derived cells upon IFN-Œ± treatment or IPS-1 activation, and in the livers of hepatitis B patients during immune active phase. Knock down of ZAP expression increased the level of HBV RNA and partially attenuated the antiviral effect elicited by IPS-1 in cell cultures. In summary, we demonstrated that ZAP is an intrinsic host antiviral factor with activity against HBV through down-regulation of viral RNA, and that ZAP plays a role in the innate control of HBV replication. Our findings thus shed light on virus-host interaction, viral pathogenesis, and antiviral approaches. "

305,0.005,1.0000,"Besides mediating the viral entry process, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope protein gp41 can bind to many host cell components and regulate cell functions. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we screened a human bone marrow cDNA library and identified a novel gp41-binding protein, CD74 (the MHC class II-associated invariant chain). Here, we report possible biological effects mediated by interaction between gp41 and CD74. We found that HIV-1 gp41 could bind directly to host CD74 in HIV-1-infected cells, and the peptide 6358 derived from gp41 loop region (aa 597-611) could effectively block the gp41-CD74 interaction. As a result of this binding, recombinant soluble gp41 and gp41 peptide 6358 activated the CD74-mediated ERK/MAPK pathway and significantly enhanced HIV-1 infection in vitro. Conversely, the enhancing effect could be suppressed by the recombinant CD74 extracellular domain. These results reveal a novel mechanism underlying gp41 mediation of HIV-1 infection and replication."

These studies, along with vaccination challenge studies in rhesus macaques, indicate the importance of cellular immune responses against HIV-1. Toward this end, we evaluated anti-HIV-1 cellular immune responses in a cohort of 54 subjects who were chronically infected with HIV-1. By validation of IFN-gamma ELISpot assay, we established a dual cut-off criterion for scoring a positive response. The magnitude and frequency of cellular immune responses were measured against HIV-1 antigens (Gag, Pol, Nef, Rev, and Tat), using synthetic peptides as antigens in ELISpot assay. Here we showed that HIV-1 Gag, Pol, and Nef were frequent targets of T cell responses in these subjects, whereas Tat and Rev were less frequently recognized. We further evaluated the possible association between host cellular immune responses and corresponding plasma viral loads in this cohort. By performing ranking correlation analysis, we demonstrated a positive correlation between host viral loads and ELISpot responses of HIV Gag and Pol in untreated subjects. For the subjects under antiviral regimens, however, we did not find any significant association. Our findings suggest that the high levels of ELISpot responses in chronically infected subjects were reflective of their persistent viral infection."
3741,0.005,1.0000,"Liver cancer ranks sixth in cancer incidence, and is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, which arises from hepatocytes and accounts for approximately 70%-85% of cases. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) frequently causes liver inflammation, hepatic damage and subsequent cirrhosis. Integrated viral DNA is found in 85%-90% of HBV-related HCCs. Its presence in tumors from non-cirrhotic livers of children or young adults further supports the role of viral DNA integration in hepatocarcinogenesis. Integration of subgenomic HBV DNA fragments into different locations within the host DNA is a significant feature of chronic HBV infection. Integration has two potential consequences: (1) the host genome becomes altered (""cis"" effect); and (2) the HBV genome becomes altered (""trans"" effect). The cis effect includes insertional mutagenesis, which can potentially disrupt host gene function or alter host gene regulation. Tumor progression is frequently associated with rearrangement and partial gain or loss of both viral and host sequences. However, the role of integrated HBV DNA in hepatocarcinogenesis remains controversial. Modern technology has provided a new paradigm to further our understanding of disease mechanisms. This review summarizes the role of HBV DNA integration in human carcinogenesis."

However, a SIV-HIV-1 chimera (RT-SHIV), in which the RT from SIVmac239 was replaced with the RT-encoding region from HIV-1, is susceptible to NNRTIs and is infectious to rhesus macaques. We have evaluated the antiviral activity of efavirenz against RT-SHIV and the emergence of efavirenz-resistant mutants in vitro and in vivo. RT-SHIV was susceptible to efavirenz with a mean effective concentration of 5.9 +/- 4.5 nM, and RT-SHIV variants selected with efavirenz in cell culture displayed 600-fold-reduced susceptibility. The efavirenz-resistant mutants of RT-SHIV had mutations in RT similar to those of HIV-1 variants that were selected under similar conditions. Efavirenz monotherapy of RT-SHIV-infected macaques produced a 1.82-log-unit decrease in plasma viral-RNA levels after 1 week. The virus load rebounded within 3 weeks in one treated animal and more slowly in a second animal. Virus isolated from these two animals contained the K103N and Y188C or Y188L mutations.

First, the CNS may be difficult to access for anti-retroviral treatment and may become a sanctuary for residual viruses. Second, HIV-1 infection may lead to AIDS dementia complex (ADC) culminating in HIV-1 encephalitis. In order to examine the pattern of drug resistance and the role of encephalitis in enhancing viral redistribution to the CNS, we compared pol gene quasispecies of the spleen and brain in two patients with and two patients without HIV-1 encephalitis, who had been treated with zidovudine (AZT). Although a variable degree of AZT resistance was noted in both the spleen and brain of all patients, phylogenetic analysis indicated that quasispecies developed rather independently in the systemic circulation (spleen) and CNS (brain) of patients without HIV-1 encephalitis, while similar pol gene sequences were obtained from the two compartments of patients with HIV-1 encephalitis. env gene V3 region of patients with HIV-1 encephalitis showed distinct quasispecies in the spleen and brain.

For example, rampant dental decay is common among children with HIV and requires advanced treatment planning that needs to be closely coordinated with members of the medical team. Maintaining good oral health in combination with medication compliance leads to sustained overall health in HIV-infected children; however, many of the medications these children take have severe adverse effects on their oral health. Furthermore, these medications may interfere with other medications that are prescribed or administered in connection with oral health care. Lastly, the systemic and oral manifestations of HIV and AIDS are different for children than they are for adults; as a result, the prognosis and treatment options for these manifestations vary, depending on the patient's age. This article will address factors that affect the oral health of HIV-infected children and adults, as well as common oral manifestations of HIV and AIDS.

To identify risk factors associated with HCV infections a case-control study was conducted in 305 unique HCV-seropositive blood donors and 610 seronegative donors matched for age and sex. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using logistic regression. The population attributable risk (PAR) to risk factor was estimated according to the Bruzzi's formula. The prevalence of anti-HCV positivity was 0.53% (95% CI: 0.489-0.572%). The final multivariate model included the following independent HCV risk factors: razor sharing (OR=29.16; 95% CI: 12.89-66.00), blood transfusion (OR=20.84; 95% CI: 3.76-115.45), acupuncture (OR=8.01; 95% CI: 3.16-20.30), a history of hospitalization, injections >10 years earlier, a family history of hepatitis B, dental treatment, and ear piercing. The PAR of risk factors are 68.4%, 6.3%, 14.1%, 23.1%, 29.5%, 29.3%, 38.9%, and 27.8%, respectively, and the total PAR is 98.3%. Infection with HCV among blood donors in Chengdu is associated with iatrogenic risk factors and beauty treatment-related risk. Razor sharing is an important risk factor for HCV infection. These results indicate that infection control measures in healthcare settings may reduce the burden of HCV infection and there is a need for development of effective educational programs to improve HCV knowledge among beauty culture professionals, barber cosmetologists, and the general public to avoid risk behaviors."
907,0.005,1.0000,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinicopathologic syndrome that includes a range of disorders associated with fatty liver from steatosis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, defined by the presence of liver fat accumulation exceeding 5% of hepatocytes in the absence of other causes of liver disease such as alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, or any other specific etiology. Half the patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who undergo additional testing for unexplained liver test abnormalities may suffer from NAFLD, which is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. In HIV-infected patients, NAFLD can result from the HIV itself, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and/or lipodystrophy. Evaluation of the liver impact of NAFLD remains mainly based on liver biopsy, but numerous noninvasive procedures are under evaluation. In HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV-) coinfected patients, steatosis seems more frequent and severe by comparison with HCV-monoinfected patients, and is associated with significant liver fibrosis, which may contribute to the more rapid progression of liver disease. First-line treatment of NAFLD is mainly based on the adequate management of the metabolic syndrome, including lifestyle changes. Specific therapeutic approaches are under investigation."
3661,0.005,1.0000,"From 1988 to 1991, 6,882 drug injectors in 15 US cities were interviewed and had serum samples collected. The interviews and samples were analyzed for determination of significant predictors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion in the 10 low seroprevalence cities and the five high seroprevalence cities. The unit of analysis was the period of observation between consecutive paired interviews/blood samples. In Cox proportional hazards regression, significant predictors of seroconversion in the low seroprevalence cities were: not being in drug treatment, injecting in outdoor settings or abandoned buildings, using crack cocaine weekly or more frequently, engaging in woman-to-woman sex, being of non-Latino race/ethnicity, and city seroprevalence. Predictors in high seroprevalence cities were: injecting with potentially infected syringes, not being in drug treatment, and having a sex partner who injected drugs. These findings suggest that HIV may be concentrated in sociobehavioral pockets of infection in low seroprevalence cities. For reducing HIV transmission, these results suggest: 1) in low seroprevalence cities, localized monitoring to detect specific emerging sociobehavioral pockets of infection, and quick implementation of appropriate targeted interventions if necessary; 2) in high seroprevalence cities, relatively more emphasis on locality-wide outreach and syringe-exchange projects to reduce risky behavior; and 3) in both types of cities, considerable expansion of drug treatment programs."
6695,0.005,1.0000,"Canadian Aboriginals are reported to clear Hepatitis C (HCV) more frequently. We tested the association of spontaneous clearance and three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the Interferon-lambda 3 (IFNL3) gene (rs12979860, rs8099917, functional variant rs8103142) and compared the SNP frequencies between HIV-HCV co-infected whites and Aboriginals from the Canadian Co-infection Cohort. HCV treatment-na√Øve individuals with at least two HCV RNA tests were included (n = 538). A spontaneous clearance case was defined as someone with two consecutive HCV RNA-negative tests, at least six months apart. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards adjusted for sex and ethnicity. Advantageous variants and haplotypes were more common in Aboriginals than Caucasians: 57% vs. 46% had the rs12979860 CC genotype, respectively; 58% vs. 48%, rs8103142 TT; 74% vs. 67%, the rs12979860 C allele; and 67% vs. 64% the TCT haplotype with three favourable alleles. The adjusted Hazard Ratios (95% CI) for spontaneous clearance were: rs12979860: 3.80 (2.20, 6.54); rs8099917: 5.14 (2.46, 10.72); and rs8103142: 4.36 (2.49, 7.62). Even after adjusting for rs12979860, Aboriginals and females cleared HCV more often, HR (95% CI) = 1.53 (0.89, 2.61) and 1.42 (0.79, 2.53), respectively. Our results suggest that favourable IFNL3 genotypes are more common among Aboriginals than Caucasians, and may partly explain the higher HCV clearance rates seen among Aboriginals. "
5645,0.005,1.0000,"To examine sex-specific risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 seroconversion among intravenous drug users, the authors conducted a nested case-control study in Baltimore, Maryland, from 1988 to 1992 comparing 146 seroconverters and 539 HIV seronegative controls. Controls were matched on sex, race, date of study entry, and duration of follow-up. Risk factor data were obtained from interviews conducted at the first seroconversion visit for the case and the closest visit for the corresponding seronegative control. Since test results were not available until several weeks after interview, both interviewers and participants were unaware of seroconversion status at the time of interview. When data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression techniques, the variables which were significantly associated with seroconversion among male intravenous drug users included age less than 35 years, a sexually transmitted disease within the past 6 months, lifetime history of syphilis, and current intravenous drug use with an abscess at the injection site. Among women, only a history of three or more sex partners was positively associated with seroconversion and having a biological child under age 18 years was inversely associated with HIV seroconversion. Although the small sample size may have limited the ability to ascertain differences in risks of seroconversion among males and females, these data suggest that sexual transmission contributes to HIV infection among intravenous drug users, especially women."
3842,0.005,1.0000,"The seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii, Dirofilaria immitis (heartworm), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infections was examined using serum or plasma samples from 746 pet cats collected between May and July 2009 from clinics and hospitals located in and around Bangkok, Thailand. The samples were tested for heartworm, FIV, and FeLV using a commercial ELISA. Of the 746 samples, 4.6% (34/746) were positive for heartworm antigen, 24.5% (183/746) had circulating FeLV antigen, and 20.1% (150/746) had antibodies against FIV. In addition, the first 348 submitted samples were tested for T. gondii antibodies using a modified agglutination test (MAT, cut off 1:25); 10.1% (35/348) were seropositive. Of the 348 cats sampled for all four pathogens, 11, 10, and 1 were positive for T. gondii antibodies and FIV antibodies, FeLV antigen, or D. immitis antigen, respectively. Of the 35 T. gondii-seropositive cats, 42.9% (15/35) were co-infected with at least one of the other three pathogens. The presence of antibodies to FIV was significantly associated with both age and gender, while FeLV antigen presence was only associated with age. In the case of FIV, males were twice as likely to be infected as females, and cats over 10 years of age were 13.5 times more likely to be infected than cats less than 1 year of age. FeLV antigen was more common in younger cats, with cats over 10 years of age being 10 times less likely to be FeLV positive than cats under 1 year of age. This is the first survey for these four pathogens affecting feline health in Thailand."
1487,0.005,1.0000,"Epithelioid angiomatosis, hemangioma-like vascular proliferations recently described in AIDS patients, has been associated with the cat scratch disease bacillus. Other vascular lesions present in AIDS patients, in particular Kaposi's sarcoma, have been associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV). We investigated the possibility of viral association with epithelioid angiomatosis by analyzing two such lesions, as well as unrelated concurrent skin lesions, for the presence of viral genetic information. Colorimetric in-situ hybridization was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections using cloned biotinylated probes for CMV, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The only virus demonstrated was EBV, and this was only in the two epithelioid angiomatosis lesions. Hybridization signal for EBV was present in the nuclei of endothelial cells and occasional histiocytes. Bacilli were demonstrated within one of the lesions by silver stain. This is the first report associating EBV with this entity, and the first-time demonstration of EBV genetic information in endothelial cells. Our data suggest that these vascular lesions may represent a nonspecific response to infection by many different agents, and that EBV may be involved in the pathogenesis of some of these lesions."
4972,0.005,1.0000,"The surveillance of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) through case reporting only reflects the epidemiologic features of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) transmission a few years earlier and not the prevalence of HIV seropositivity. HIV infection is not a notifiable condition in Quebec. We were asked by the minist√®re de la Sant√© et des Services sociaux du Qu√©bec to perform a pilot project for the surveillance of HIV seropositivity using a network of sentinel physicians. From May 15, 1988, to Sept. 30, 1989, physicians from four collaborating centres collected data on the serologic status, demographic characteristics and risk factors for 4209 patients who underwent HIV antibody testing. Of the 3899 subjects included in the study 7.9% were HIV positive. Through logistic regression analysis the following variables were found to be significantly associated with HIV seropositivity: presence of HIV-related symptoms (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 36.5), origin from an endemic area (POR 9.1), homosexuality or bisexuality (POR 8.4), intravenous drug use (POR 4.2), male sex (POR 2.8), previous HIV antibody testing (POR 2.5) and previous sexually transmitted disease (POR 1.8). Over the study period we found a large increase in HIV seroprevalence among intravenous drug users (4.2% in 1988 to 19.0% in 1989) (p = 0.02). This increase might reflect a recent change in the epidemiologic pattern of HIV transmission in Quebec. Surveillance of HIV seropositivity through a network of sentinel physicians may be a reasonable alternative to mandatory reporting."
1316,0.005,1.0000,"Project HEART, an acronym for Helping Enhance Adherence to Retroviral Therapy, was a prospective, controlled study to develop, implement, and evaluate a clinic-based behavioural intervention to prevent adherence failure among HIV-infected adults beginning their first highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen (N = 227). In this paper, we describe the conceptualisation of the Project HEART adherence intervention, characteristics of the participants, and lessons learned implementing HEART in an inner-city clinic setting. A multi-component intervention, HEART combined enhanced education, reminders, adherence feedback, social support and adherence-focused problem solving in an integrated manner to address common cognitive, motivational, and social barriers to adherence. Unique components of the intervention included use of participant-identified adherence support partners and a standardized adherence barriers assessment to develop and implement individualised adherence plans. Lessons learned regarding the feasibility of using participant-identified support partners were as follows. Few participants eligible for the study had trouble identifying a support partner. Over 90% of support partners attended at least one intervention visit. Support partners were most available and amenable to participate early in the initiation of therapy. Participants' experiences as the 'supported' partner were generally positive. Though many participants faced barriers not easily addressed by this intervention (for example, housing instability), formally integrating support partners into the intervention helped to address many other common adherence barriers. Family and friends are an under-utilised resource in HIV medication adherence. Enlisting the help of support partners is a practical and economical approach to adherence counselling."
7442,0.005,1.0000,"The events that contribute to the progression to AIDS during the acute phase of a primate lentiviral infection are still poorly understood. In this study, we used pathogenic and nonpathogenic simian models of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques (RMs) and African green monkeys (AGMs), respectively, to investigate the relationship between apoptosis in lymph nodes and the extent of viral replication, immune activation, and disease outcome. Here, we show that, in SIVmac251-infected RMs, a marked increased in lymphocyte apoptosis is evident during primary infection at the level of lymph nodes. Interestingly, the levels of apoptosis correlated with the extent of viral replication and the rate of disease progression to AIDS, with higher apoptosis in RMs of Indian genetic background than in those of Chinese origin. In stark contrast, no changes in the levels of lymphocyte apoptosis were observed during primary infection in the nonpathogenic model of SIVagm-sab infection of AGMs, despite similarly high rates of viral replication. A further and early divergence between SIV-infected RMs and AGMs was observed in terms of the dynamics of T- and B-cell proliferation in lymph nodes, with RMs showing significantly higher levels of cycling cells (Ki67(+)) in the T-cell zones in association with relatively low levels of Ki67(+) in the B-cell zones, whereas AGMs displayed a low frequency of Ki67(+) in the T-cell area but a high proportion of Ki67(+) cells in the B-cell area. As such, this study suggests that species-specific host factors determine an early immune response to SIV that predominantly involves either cellular or humoral immunity in RMs and AGMs, respectively. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypotheses that (i) high levels of T-cell activation and lymphocyte apoptosis are key pathogenic factors during pathogenic SIV infection of RMs and (ii) low T-cell activation and apoptosis are determinants of the AIDS resistance of SIVagm-infected AGMs, despite high levels of SIVagm replication."
5030,0.005,1.0000,"Zoster is uncommon before the age of 50 years in immunologically normal individuals, but it occurs with increased frequency in people who are immunosuppressed. A retrospective review of 300 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, revealed that 8% had prior zoster, a rate that is sevenfold greater than historic controls of the same age. We prospectively examined forty-eight patients, with no known immunodeficiency or signs of AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC), who presented with zoster localized to the thoracic region. Forty-one patients had known risk factors for AIDS and thirty-five had antibody to the AIDS-associated virus (AAV) at the time of presentation. One seropositive subject had no known risk factors. Absolute lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte OKT4/OKT8 ratios, and lymphocyte mitogen responses were all depressed in subjects with antibody to AAV when compared with seronegative individuals. Seven of thirty-three AAV antibody-positive subjects, who could be followed longitudinally, developed AIDS from 1 to 28 months (mean = 13) after zoster. One antibody-negative subject seroconverted to become AAV seropositive 16 months after zoster and developed Kaposi's sarcoma 1 month later. These eight subjects had persistently low lymphocyte OKT4/OKT8 ratios and elevated beta-2 microglobulin. In patients at risk for AIDS, the occurrence of zoster may be one sign that heralds the marked depression of cellular immunity associated with AIDS or ARC."
9982,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env) binding induces proapoptotic signals in CD4(+) T cells without a requirement of infection. Defective virus particles, which represent the majority of HIV-1, usually contain a functional Env and therefore represent a potentially significant cause of such CD4(+)-T-cell loss. We reasoned that an HIV-1 inhibitor that prohibits Env-host cell interactions could block the destructive effects of defective particles. HIV-1 attachment inhibitors (AIs), which potently inhibit Env-CD4 binding and subsequent downstream effects of Env, display low-nanomolar antiapoptotic potency and prevent CD4(+)-T-cell depletion from mixed lymphocyte cultures, also with low-nanomolar potency. Specific Env amino acid changes that confer resistance to AI antientry activity eliminate AI antiapoptotic effects. We observed that CD4(+)-T-cell destruction is specific for CXCR4-utilizing HIV-1 strains and that the fusion blocker enfuvirtide inhibits Env-mediated CD4(+)-T-cell killing but is substantially less potent than AIs. These observations, in conjunction with observed antiapoptotic activities of soluble CD4 and the CXCR4 blocker AMD3100, suggest that this AI activity functions through a mechanism common to AI antientry activity, e.g., prevention of Env conformation changes necessary for specific interactions with cellular factors that facilitate viral entry. Our study suggests that AIs, in addition to having potent antientry activity, could contribute to immune system homeostasis in individuals infected with HIV-1 that can engage CXCR4, thereby mitigating the increased risk of adverse clinical events observed in such individuals on current antiretroviral regimens."
2342,0.005,1.0000,"High levels of serum beta 2-microglobulin have been associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and beta 2-microglobulin has been used with other serological and immunological markers for monitoring disease progression. The usefulness of beta 2-microglobulin as a prognostic marker during human immunodeficiency virus infection has been demonstrated in homosexual men and hemophiliacs; few and contradictory data have been reported in intravenous drug users. We have evaluated a cohort of 160 intravenous drug users (81 seronegative and 79 seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus infection) with normal renal function to assess whether serum beta 2-microglobulin could be used as a serological marker for monitoring infection; 78 healthy subjects were used as controls. Of 79 seropositive drug users, 54 were asymptomatic or had persistent generalized lymphoadenopathy the remaining 25 had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Seropositive patients were tested for CD4+ lymphocyte number, p24 antigen and anti-p24 antibodies. A significant statistical difference was found in mean serum beta 2-microglobulin levels between seronegative and seropositive drug users. Moreover, higher levels of beta 2-microglobulin were observed in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients compared with asymptomatic or patients with persistent lymphadenopathy. A significant relationship was also observed between increased concentration of beta 2-microglobulin and the serological and immunological markers which indicate human immunodeficiency virus disease progression."
5091,0.005,1.0000,"HLA-B*5701 is the host factor most strongly associated with slow HIV-1 disease progression, although risk of progression may vary among patients carrying this allele. The interplay between HIV-1 evolutionary rate variation and risk of progression to AIDS in HLA-B*5701 subjects was studied using longitudinal viral sequences from high-risk progressors (HRPs) and low-risk progressors (LRPs). Posterior distributions of HIV-1 genealogies assuming a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock were used to estimate the absolute rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions for different set of branches. Rates of viral evolution, as well as in vitro viral replication capacity assessed using a novel phenotypic assay, were correlated with various clinical parameters. HIV-1 synonymous substitution rates were significantly lower in LRPs than HRPs, especially for sets of internal branches. The viral population infecting LRPs was also characterized by a slower increase in synonymous divergence over time. This pattern did not correlate to differences in viral fitness, as measured by in vitro replication capacity, nor could be explained by differences among subjects in T cell activation or selection pressure. Interestingly, a significant inverse correlation was found between baseline CD4+ T cell counts and mean HIV-1 synonymous rate (which is proportional to the viral replication rate) along branches representing viral lineages successfully propagating through time up to the last sampled time point. The observed lower replication rate in HLA-B*5701 subjects with higher baseline CD4+ T cell counts provides a potential model to explain differences in risk of disease progression among individuals carrying this allele.

5854,0.005,1.0000,"The rapid evolution of HIV-1 is a major obstacle to viral eradication. Early antiretroviral therapy (ART) during primary HIV-1 infection could limit viral diversity. Eighteen patients recently infected with HIV-1 were selected. Nine initiated ART soon after enrolment and nine remained untreated. Replication-competent (RC) viruses were quantified at baseline and after one year of follow-up. Viral diversity in the C2V5 envelope region was evaluated from plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and cell culture at both time points. The amount of RC virus in the treated group declined (median -5.42 infectious units per million [IUPM]) while it remained stable or increased in the untreated group (median +0.87 IUPM). At one year post infection, we observed a significant increase in diversity for the C2V5 (+0.150%) region, specifically in the hypervariable loops V4 (+0.73%) and V5 (+0.77%), in the untreated group. More importantly, viral diversity did not significantly increase in treated individuals during the first year post infection. Genetic diversity during primary infection remains low through the first year of infection. Early treatment could contribute to a decrease in RC viruses from PBMCs and to limitation of viral diversification in the viral reservoir. These findings may have relevance for the rational design of specific immunotherapeutic strategies."
1817,0.005,1.0000,"The frequency of CCR5-Delta32 allele in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the southern Brazilian population was determined in a cross-sectional study carried out from October 2001 to June 2004. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells of 134 healthy blood donors, 145 HIV-1-exposed seronegative individuals, 152 HIV-1-seropositive asymptomatic individuals, and 478 HIV-1-seropositive individuals with AIDS. A fragment with 225 base-pairs of the CCR5 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The CCR5-Delta32 homozygous deletion was observed in 2 (1.5%) blood donors and in 1 (0.7%) individual HIV-1-exposed seronegative, and was absent among all the HIV-1-seropositive individuals (Fisher's exact test, p=0.0242). The frequency of the homozygous CCR5-Delta32 deletion in the HIV-1-exposed did not differ when compared with that observed in the HIV-1 seronegative blood donors (Fisher's exact test, p=0.6093; OR: 2.18, 95% CI: 0.11-129.6). The wild-type genotype CCR5/CCR5 frequency was higher among the HIV-1-seropositive with AIDS compared to HIV-1 seropositive asymptomatic individuals (Chi-square test, p=0.0263; OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.03-3.97). The absence of the homozygous deletion of CCR5-Delta32 among HIV-1-seropositive individuals underscored that this genotype is an important genetic factor associated with the decreased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. The higher frequency of heterozygosity for the CCR5-Delta32 and the CCR5-Delta32 allele in HIV-1 seropositive asymptomatic compared to HIV-seropositive with AIDS individuals also underscored that this deletion could be associated with the delay of the HIV-1 disease progression in this population. However, the low frequency of CCR5-Delta32 homozygosity observed among HIV-1-exposed seronegative individuals shows that the allele could not explain, by itself, the natural resistance to HIV-1 infection and different mechanisms of protection against HIV-1 infection that must be involved in this population."
4683,0.005,1.0000,"Recombinant and synthetic peptides derived from the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) genome corresponding to portions of the envelope (env) and internal core protein (gag) were examined for their immunoregulatory effects on the natural killer (NK) cell activity of lymphocytes from healthy donors and from patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two recombinant peptides (env-gag and Env 80-DHFR) and three chemically synthesized peptides (env 487-511, env 578-608 and env 647-659) were used. Normal lymphocytes precultured for 24 to 72 hrs. with either env-gag, env 487-511, or env 647-659 at 5 and 50 ng/ml concentrations which significantly stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, produced significant suppression of NK activities. Two control peptides, one derived from the E. coli vector used to clone the HIV env-gag fusion peptide and another, a non-HIV-1 viral antigen (rubeola virus) did not produce any observable effect on NK activity of normal lymphocytes demonstrating the specificity of the reaction. Env-gag peptide also inhibited the NK activities of Percoll-separated, NK-enriched large granular lymphocytes. In target binding assays, lymphocytes precultured with env-gag significantly suppressed the target binding capacity of effector cells and produced significantly lower levels of natural killer cytotoxic factor (NKCF). In kinetic studies, lymphocytes from normal donors preincubated with env-gag for 24 to 72 hrs. produced significant inhibition of their NK activity and an even greater inhibitory effect on NK activities was observed when lymphocytes from AIDS patients were preincubated with HIV peptides. Thus HIV-1 peptides, which we previously demonstrated could regulate B- and T-lymphocyte activities, are also capable of regulating the NK activities of lymphocytes from HIV-1-infected and normal individuals."
5966,0.005,1.0000,"Reports of in vitro resistance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to zidovudine (AZT) have raised concerns about the development of resistance to other dideoxynucleosides in clinical use. To address this, we have developed a screening assay which supports the growth of clinical isolates and have applied this to a series of paired isolates from patients entered into a phase I trial of didanosine (DDI). Thirteen patients (10 with AIDS, 3 with AIDS-related complex) who had been exposed to AZT for a mean of 6.5 months (range, 1 to 13 months) were treated with DDI at 750 mg/day. Paired isolates were obtained pretherapy and after a mean of 58 weeks (range, 21 to 90) of DDI therapy by coculture of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBLs) with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs. Isolates were passaged only one additional time in PBLs and then tested in parallel in a microtiter assay with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs as targets. PBLs were infected with 10(5) 50% tissue culture infectious doses per 10(7) cells and exposed to DDI (1 to 50 microM) or AZT (0.01 to 100 microM), and supernatants were assayed for the HIV p24 antigen at 7 days postinfection. Control AZT-susceptible and resistant isolates were included. The median pre- and posttherapy DDI susceptibilities of the 13 pairs of isolates were 10.0 microM (range, 1 to 25 microM) and 17.5 microM (range, 2.5 to 50 microM), respectively (P = 0.036; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These studies thus indicated that (i) the susceptibility to DDI tends to mildly decrease with drug exposure; (ii) the susceptibility to AZT improves with time off AZT; (iii) baseline susceptibilities to DDI have a wide range, and the CD4 response may correlate with the initial susceptibility; and (iv) a PBL-based microtiter assay is useful for screening clinical isolated for dideoxynucleoside susceptibility profiles."

Sixty-nine nucleoside-na√Øve CHB patients with baseline HBV DNA of 10(8) copies/mL or more were randomized 1:1 to open-label treatment with entecavir 0.5 mg/day or adefovir 10 mg/day for a minimum of 52 weeks. The primary efficacy analysis compared mean reduction in HBV DNA at week 12 adjusted for baseline levels using linear regression. Entecavir was superior to adefovir for mean change from baseline in HBV DNA at week 12 (-6.23 log(10) copies/mL versus -4.42 log(10) copies/mL, respectively; mean difference -1.58 log(10) copies/mL; P < 0.0001). Both drugs demonstrated biphasic viral kinetics, with a first phase of rapid decline lasting 10 days. A significant difference favoring ETV was reached at day 10 (day 10 ETV-ADV difference estimate: -0.66 log(10) copies/mL; 95% CI [-0.30, -0.01]). Early virological response was found to be predictive of subsequent virological response, with those having lower HBV DNA levels at day 10 being more likely to achieve HBV DNA of less than 300 copies/mL at week 48. In addition, there was considerably less variability in the extent of HBV DNA reductions in patients treated with entecavir versus adefovir. Both the mean decrease in serum HBV DNA and the proportion of patients achieving HBV DNA less than 300 copies/mL were greater in entecavir-treated than adefovir-treated patients at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48. At week 48, one (3%) ETV-treated versus 15 (47%) ADV-treated patients had HBV DNA of 10(5) copies/mL or more. Both antivirals were well tolerated."
4980,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis virus B or C (HBV, HCV) transmission are major risks following infusion of coagulation factor concentrates. Thus, several methods have been used to achieve viral inactivation of concentrates prepared from plasma collected from a large number of donors. In this study, 32 patients with haemophilia A or B (n = 31) or von Willebrand's disease (n = 1) were treated between 1987 and 1990 only with factor VIII or IX concentrates inactivated by the solvent-detergent procedure. During this period, none of these cases exhibited elevated liver enzymes (alanine amino transferase), and serological tests for HIV, HBV and HCV infections always remained negative. This suggests that the solvent-detergent procedure of concentrate inactivation is an efficient method to prevent not only HIV or HBV transmission but also HCV infection in haemophiliacs."

To achieve this, it is critical to better understand mechanisms of innate and adaptive immune dysfunction and pathways of liver pathology. Here, we summarise recent advances pertaining to early immune events during acute HBV infection in an unusual cohort of patients sampled in the pre-clinical phase, and describe mechanisms of CD8 T cell attrition that apply to patients with chronic HBV infection. Furthermore, we describe a novel pathway of hepatocyte death mediated by innate natural killer (NK) cells. These pathways together provide novel pathogenic mechanisms for impaired viral control and liver damage during chronic HBV infection."
440,0.005,1.0000,"In this article, we studied the T cell receptor (TCR)beta chain transcript mobilization in peripheral blood lymphocytes harvested from HIV-1-infected patients before and after vaccination with a mixture of six lipopeptides and at the moment and serially after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) interruption. This study was performed by using a combined qualitative and quantitative assessment of Vbeta mRNA alterations at the level of complementary determining region 3 length distribution (CDR3-LD) of the TCR. Whereas healthy individuals displayed both stable CDR3-LD profiles and Vbeta transcript accumulations over time, the four HIV-1-infected patients in a quiescent disease phase under HAART have a highly significantly biased CDR3-LD. In addition, they displayed a significant further increase of alterations of their beta CDR3-LD profile after vaccination and both a more altered CDR3-LD (p < 0.05) and an increased transcript accumulation of some Vbeta families after HAART interruption. These modifications mostly concerned the CD8(+ve) T cells. Such a global approach of TCR alterations may help to follow the immune response of these patients and allow targeting of more complex in vivo studies by identifying the T cells with a selected repertoire."
7173,0.005,1.0000,"Despite a history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination prior to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), most of HIV-infected children do not have protective antibody to HBV infection. The efficacy of an additional booster dose in children with immune recovery on HAART remains unknown. This study was conducted to determine the response rate of HBV antibody after re-vaccination in HIV-infected children with immune recovery on HAART. Sixty-three successfully HAART-treated HIV-infected children with history of prior HBV vaccination received 10microg doses of recombinant HBV vaccine (Government Pharmaceutical Organization-Merieux Biological Product, Bangkok, Thailand) intramuscularly at 0, 2 and 6 months. The vaccine response rates were 17.4, 82.5, and 92.1% at 2, 6 and 7 months after the first dose of vaccine, respectively. Plasma HIV RNA level below the limit of detection at the time of re-vaccination was associated with successful vaccine response. HIV-infected children with immune recovery after HAART are likely to benefit from three-dose HBV re-vaccination."
820,0.005,1.0000,"Mycophenolic acid (MPA) increases the activity of both abacavir (ABC) and didanosine (ddI) in vitro against wild-type and multinucleoside-resistant HIV. We treated 7 patients with diagnosed AIDS who did not respond to eight or more antiretroviral therapies in an open label pilot study with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), ABC, ddI, amprenavir (APV), and ritonavir (RTV), with or without efavirenz (EFV). Therapy was well tolerated despite the patients' advanced disease states. No significant decline in lymphocyte or other blood counts was observed. Median HIV RNA was 5.26 log10 copies/ml at entry, 4.53 log10 copies/ml at 4 weeks, and 5.13 log10 copies/ml at 16 weeks. Median CD4+ count was 34 cells/microl at entry and 39 cells/microl at 16 weeks of therapy. CD4+ counts increased further in five study subjects on extended therapy to 25 weeks (median 27 cells/microl at entry, 66 cells/microl at close), despite loss of virologic suppression in 4 of 5 cases. MPA can induce apoptosis in lymphocytes in vitro. However despite viral rebound, cell surface markers of apoptosis and activation declined in total CD3+ cells and CD3+/CD4+ cells twofold to fourfold in 4 of 5 adherent study subjects at 16 weeks, reaching levels comparable with those found in seronegative donors. Although low-dose MMF appears safe in late-stage HIV disease, this study did not demonstrate virologic efficacy. Higher doses of MMF may be more effective. With careful monitoring of toxicities and pharmacokinetics, MMF deserves further testing in HIV therapy."

1085,0.005,1.0000,"Perinatal or mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains the major risk factor for chronic HBV infection worldwide. In addition to hepatitis B immune globulin and vaccination, oral antiviral therapies in highly viremic mothers can further decrease MTCT of HBV. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the evidence on the efficacy and maternal and fetal safety of antiviral therapy during pregnancy. A protocol was developed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guideline writing committee. We searched multiple databases for controlled studies that enrolled pregnant women with chronic HBV infection treated with antiviral therapy. Outcomes of interest were reduction of MTCT and adverse outcomes to mothers and newborns. Study selection and data extraction were done by pairs of independent reviewers. We included 26 studies that enrolled 3622 pregnant women. Antiviral therapy reduced MTCT, as defined by infant hepatitis B surface antigen seropositivity (risk ratio = 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.4) or infant HBV DNA seropositivity (risk ratio = 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.5) at 6-12 months. No significant differences were found in the congenital malformation rate, prematurity rate, and Apgar scores. Compared to control, lamivudine or telbivudine improved maternal HBV DNA suppression at delivery and during 4-8 weeks' postpartum follow-up. Tenofovir showed improvement in HBV DNA suppression at delivery. No significant differences were found in postpartum hemorrhage, cesarean section, and elevated creatinine kinase rates."
5512,0.005,1.0000,"Non-A, non-B viral hepatitis was transmitted to four colony-born chimpanzees by infusion of three lots of antihemophilic factor (factor VIII) implicated in the transmission of non-A, non-B hepatitis to two human recipients. All four inoculated animals showed histopathological evidence of viral hepatitis, and all demonstrated significant ALT elevations between seven and one-half weeks after inoculation. Acute-phase plasma from one of the infected chimpanzees (no. 771) was shown to induce non-A, non-B hepatitis in two other chimpanzees approximately three weeks after their inoculation. In addition, an acute-phase open liver wedge biopsy obtained from animal no. 771 was processed and examined by immune electron microscopy (IEM) for virus-like particles with convalescent serum from a serologically confirmed case of non-A, non-B hepatitis. Twenty-five to 30 nm (mean = 27 nm) diameter virus-like particles that were either ""full"" or ""empty"" were identified in this liver preparation by IEM. Two additional chimpanzees inoculated with a cesium chloride gradient fraction of an isopycnically banded liver homogenate (animal no. 771) also developed elevated ALT activity two to two and one-half weeks later. Our findings have experimentally verified that commercially produced factor VIII materials can induce non-A, non-B hepatitis in champanzees and that the disease can be subpassaged in these animals by inoculation of either acute-phase plasma or liver. These results also provide evidence for the association of 27 nm-diameter virus-like particles with non-A, non-B viral hepatitis."
9874,0.005,1.0000,"We studied the reliability and validity of the World Health Organization quality of life (WHOQOL) assessment instrument in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. WHOQOL-BREF was used to assess 136 HIV-infected outpatients. The results were analyzed and compared with data from 213 healthy persons. The Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency ranged from 0.74 to 0.85 across domains in HIV-infected patients. The test-retest reliability ranged from 0.64 to 0.79 across domains at average 4-week retest interval. Factor analysis identified four major factors: social, psychological, environment, and physical, consistent with the four domains of the instrument. The scores of all four domains correlated positively with self-evaluated health status and happiness (r range: 0.52-0.60 and 0.55-0.73 across domains, respectively), and correlated negatively with the number and severity of symptoms (r range: -0.40 to -0.47 and -0.41 to -0.52, respectively). The scores of physical, psychological and social domains, but not the environment domain, discriminated between healthy persons and HIV-infected patients (all p < 0.01). We conclude that the WHOQOL-BREF can be a useful quality-of-life instrument in patients with HIV infection."
670,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus infection leads to a high rate of chronicity. Mechanisms of viral clearance and persistence are still poorly understood. In this study, hepatic gene expression analysis was performed to identify any molecular signature associated with the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in chimpanzees. Acutely HCV-infected chimpanzees with self-limited infection or progression to chronicity were studied. Interferon stimulated genes were induced irrespective of the outcome of infection. Early induction of a set of genes associated with cell proliferation and immune activation was associated with subsequent viral clearance. Specifically, two of the genes: interleukin binding factor 3 (ILF3) and cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein (TIA1), associated with robust T-cell response, were highly induced early in chimpanzees with self-limited infection. Up-regulation of genes associated with CD8+ T cell response was evident only during the clearance phase of the acute self-limited infection. The induction of these genes may represent an initial response of cellular injury and proliferation that successfully translates to a ""danger signal"" leading to induction of adaptive immunity to control viral infection. This primary difference in hepatic gene expression between self-limited and chronic infections supports the concept that successful activation of HCV-specific T-cell response is critical in clearance of acute HCV infection."
3140,0.005,1.0000,"The increasing demand for fertility advice among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive women under our care led us to review the incidence of infertility and the ethical problems associated with its management. All HIV-positive women who attended the HIV outpatients clinic from October 1990 to the end of January 1996 were studied. The main outcome measures were: the number of women undergoing infertility investigations before and after HIV diagnosis, their demographic and social details, and the outcome of these investigations. Most of the 183 women studied were in their reproductive years (mean age 32.7 +/- 6.7 years). Nine women had undergone infertility investigations, and/or treatment before HIV diagnosis, three of whom were diagnosed with HIV during routine testing prior to IVF treatment. Six declined further infertility treatment after discovering their HIV status. Eight women have undergone infertility investigations after HIV diagnosis but none have achieved pregnancy to date. Management decisions may have been hampered by ethical uncertainties in several cases. In conclusion therefore, as requests for infertility treatment from HIV-infected women occur and may become more common as the prevalence of HIV infection in women continues to rise, the ethical issues associated with the management of this problem demand urgent attention so that clear guidelines are available to aid treatment decisions."
8444,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C infection is a complex entity associated with sizable morbidity and mortality, with great social and economic consequences that put a heavy potential burden on healthcare systems allover the world. Despite the great improvement of hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy and its high clinical efficacy, major influencing factors are still hindering and diminishing the effectiveness of hepatitis C treatment. This minimizes the quality of life of the infected patients and reduces the outcome of such therapy, particularly in certain groups of patients such as intravenous drug users and patients coinfected with human immune deficiency virus (HIV). A variety of factors were evolved either at patient individual level, healthcare providers, community surrounding levels, or healthcare setting systems. Analyzing and understanding these factors could help to improve HCV interventions and, thus, reduce the burden of such infection. The objectives of this paper were to highlight such factors and outline the holistic approaches that could be used to overcome such factors."
9952,0.005,1.0000,"Cofactors for the clinical expression of infection due to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not well understood. We asked if there was a familial tendency to the development of complications of HIV infection. We examined 35 hemophilic sibships in which at least two brothers with classic hemophilia (factor VIII deficiency) were infected with HIV. Twenty-four (34%) of the 70 patients had serious sequelae of infection, and 46 (66%) were asymptomatic or had only lymph node enlargement. Using Fisher's exact test, we found the concordance among siblings for serious sequelae of HIV infection was greater than would be expected by chance. When analysis was restricted to include only siblings known to be infected for more than two years, this concordance was still present. In the study population, birth order and mean yearly usage of factor VIII concentrate were unrelated to the outcome of HIV infection. The data indicate a familial tendency to serious complications of HIV infection. The factor(s) responsible for this familial tendency are currently under investigation."
5461,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-infected persons entering the criminal justice system (CJS) often experience suboptimal healthcare system engagement and social instability, including homelessness. We evaluated surveys from a multisite study of 743 HIV-infected jail detainees prescribed or eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) to understand correlates of healthcare engagement prior to incarceration, focusing on differences by housing status. Dependent variables of healthcare engagement were: (1) having an HIV provider, (2) taking ART, and (3) being adherent (‚â•95% of prescribed doses) to ART during the week before incarceration. Homeless subjects, compared to their housed counterparts, were significantly less likely to be engaged in healthcare using any measure. Despite Ryan White funding availability, insurance coverage remains insufficient among those entering jails, and having health insurance was the most significant factor correlated with having an HIV provider and taking ART. Individuals interfacing with the CJS, especially those unstably housed, need innovative interventions to facilitate healthcare access and retention. "
7343,0.005,1.0000,"Reducing transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States requires new strategies, including emphasis on prevention of transmission by HIV-infected persons. Through ongoing attention to prevention, risky sexual and needle-sharing behaviors among persons with HIV infection can be reduced and transmission of HIV infection prevented. Medical care providers can substantially affect HIV transmission by screening their HIV-infected patients for risk behaviors; communicating prevention messages; discussing sexual and drug-use behavior; positively reinforcing changes to safer behavior; referring patients for services such as substance abuse treatment; facilitating partner notification, counseling, and testing; and identifying and treating other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). To help incorporate HIV prevention into the medical care of HIV-infected persons, CDC, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America developed these recommendations. The recommendations are general and apply to incorporating HIV prevention into the medical care of all HIV-infected adolescents and adults, regardless of age, sex, or race/ethnicity. They are intended for all persons who provide medical care to HIV-infected persons (e.g., physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, physician assistants); they might also be useful to those who deliver prevention messages (e.g., case managers, social workers, health educators). The recommendations were developed by using an evidence-based approach. For each recommendation, the strength of the recommendation, the quality of available evidence supporting the recommendation, and the outcome for which the recommendation is rated are provided. The recommendations are categorized into three major components: screening for HIV transmission risk behaviors and STDs, providing brief behavioral risk-reduction interventions in the office setting and referring selected patients for additional prevention interventions and other related services, and facilitating notification and counseling of sex and needle-sharing partners of infected persons."

Because of the limited sensitivity of commercial assays, transmitted drug resistance (TDR) may be underestimated; thus, the effect that TDR has on treatment outcome needs to be investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of TDR in HIV-infected patients and to evaluate the significance of TDR with respect to treatment outcome by analyzing plasma viral RNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cell proviral DNA for the presence of drug resistance mutations."
8974,0.005,1.0000,The outcome of infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown to be influenced by genetic host factors.

8561,0.005,1.0000,"In the United States, most reported cases of hepatitis B occur in adults as a result of behavioural, lifestyle, or occupational exposures, but a significant number of children also become infected in well defined settings. Although only 1-3% of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections occur in children under 5 years of age, they account for 20-30% of all chronic infections. A new strategy for HBV prevention in the USA includes integration of HBV vaccine into childhood immunisation schedules. Vaccination strategies that target high risk groups have not been effective. To determine the frequency and severity of community acquired chronic hepatitis C, patients with acute non-A, non-B hepatitis identified in four sentinel counties in the United States were followed prospectively. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was found in 106 (82%) of 130 patients. Ninety three per cent of the HCV positive patients had a risk factor for their infection: 59% parenteral, 6% sexual or household, and 28% low socioeconomic level. Chronic hepatitis developed in 62%, independently of the risk factor for infection. HCV-RNA persisted in most patients, including those with biochemical resolution of their hepatitis. This study suggests that HCV may be a major cause of liver disease and persistent viraemia in the United States."
5240,0.005,1.0000,"Monocytotropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infect mononuclear phagocytes as well as activated T cells, but do not usually infect immature human myeloid cell lines in vitro. The HL-60 promyelocytic/myeloblastic cell line and the promonocytic line, U937, were susceptible to productive infection by monocytotropic HIV-1 isolates (HIV-1JR-FL and HTLV-IIIBa-L) after treatment with retinoic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, dibutyryl cAMP, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Virus production was only detected when these compounds were added before virus infection. Virus replication did not correlate with CD4 receptor expression because undifferentiated HL-60 cells express CD4 and the level of CD4 expression did not increase after differentiation in the presence of retinoic acid, 1,25(OH)2D3, or TPA. A mature monocytic cell line (THP-1) was capable of infection without pretreatment, and treatment with differentiating agents enhanced virus production. A chronically infected cell line (J-HL-60) was isolated after HIV-1JR-FL infection of HL-60 cells treated with retinoic acid. Virus production in this cell line was enhanced more than 10-fold after differentiation in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 or TPA. The majority of virus production by 1,25(OH)2D3-treated J-HL-60 cells was associated with the mature, adherent population. Molecular analysis of a cloned line of J-HL-60 showed integration of a single DNA provirus. These results suggest that cellular factors associated with precursor cell differentiation along the myelomonocytic pathway are required for optimal replication of monocytotropic HIV-1 strains in vitro."
6581,0.005,1.0000,"Vitamin D regulates bone metabolism but has also immunoregulatory properties. In HIV-infected patients bone disorders are increasingly observed. Furthermore, low 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) levels have been associated with low CD4(+) counts, immunological hyperactivity, and AIDS progression rates. Few studies have examined the vitamin D status in HIV-infected patients. This study will specifically focus on the effects of antiretroviral agents on vitamin D status. Furthermore, the effect of vitamin D status on CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART will be evaluated. Among 252 included patients the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<35 nmol/liter from April to September and <25 nmol/liter from October to March) was 29%. Female sex, younger age, dark skin, and NNRTI treatment were significant risk factors in univariate analysis, although in multivariate analyses skin pigmentation remained the only independent risk factor. Median 25(OH)D(3) levels were significantly lower in white NNRTI-treated patients [54.5(27.9-73.8) nmol/liter] compared to white PI-treated patients [77.3 (46.6-100.0) nmol/liter, p = 0.007], while among nonwhites no difference was observed. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients had significantly higher blood PTH levels than patients without treatment. Moreover, NNRTI treatment puts patients at risk of elevated PTH levels (>6.5 pmol/liter). Linear regression analysis showed that vitamin D status did not affect CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART. In conclusion, 29% of the HIV-1-infected patients had vitamin D deficiency, with skin color as an independent risk factor. NNRTI treatment may add more risk for vitamin D deficiency. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients showed higher PTH levels and might therefore be at risk of bone problems. Evaluation of 25(OH)D(3) and PTH levels, especially in NNRTI-treated and dark skinned HIV-1-infected patients, is necessary to detect and treat vitamin D deficiency early."
3986,0.005,1.0000,"An integrated HIV-1 genomic DNA leads to an infected cell becoming either an active or a latent virus-producing cell. Upon appropriate activation, a latently infected cell can result in production of progeny viruses that spread the infection to uninfected cells. The host proteins influence several steps of HIV-1 infection including formation of the preintegration complex (PIC), a key nucleoprotein intermediate essential for integration of reverse transcribed viral DNA into the chromosome. Much effort has gone into the identification of host proteins contributing to the assembly of functional PICs. Experimental approaches included the use of yeast two-hybrid system, co-immunoprecipitation, affinity tagged HIV-1 viral proteins and in vitro reconstitution of salt-stripped PIC activity. Several host proteins identified using these approaches have been shown to affect HIV-1 replication in cells and influence catalytic activities of recombinant IN in vitro. However, the comprehensive identification and characterization of host proteins associated with HIV-1 PICs of infected cells have been hindered in part by the technical limitation in acquiring sufficient amount of catalytically active PICs. To efficiently identify additional host factors associated with PICs in infected cells, we have developed the following novel approach. The catalytically active PICs from HIV-1-infected CD4+ cells were isolated using biotinylated target DNA, and the proteins selectively co-purifying with PICs have been analyzed by mass spectrometry. This technology enabled us to reveal at least 19 host proteins that are associated with HIV-1 PICs, of which 18 proteins have not been described previously with respect to HIV-1 integration. Physiological functions of the identified proteins range from chromatin organization to protein transport. A detailed characterization of these host proteins could provide new insights into the mechanism of HIV-1 integration and uncover new antiviral targets to block HIV-1 integration."
7220,0.005,1.0000,"The development of multidrug-resistant viruses compromises the efficacy of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) therapy and limits treatment options. Therefore, new targets that can be used to develop novel antiviral agents need to be identified. One such target is the interaction between Vpr, one of the accessory gene products of HIV-1 and Importin alpha, which is crucial, not only for the nuclear import of Vpr, but also for HIV-1 replication in macrophages. We have identified a potential parent compound, hematoxylin, which suppresses Vpr-Importin alpha interaction, thereby inhibiting HIV-1 replication in a Vpr-dependent manner. Analysis by real-time PCR demonstrated that hematoxylin specifically inhibited nuclear import step of pre-integration complex. Thus, hematoxylin is a new anti-HIV-1 inhibitor that targets the nuclear import of HIV-1 via the Vpr-Importin alpha interaction, suggesting that a specific inhibitor of the interaction between viral protein and the cellular factor may provide a new strategy for HIV-1 therapy."
1028,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of the audit was to assess the implementation of the protocols developed by Lothian University National Health Service Trust for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) against blood-borne virus infections. Patients at risk of infection after an injury were referred to the Department of Genitourinary Medicine (GUM) Edinburgh Royal Infirmary for assessment. A brief description of the incident, the time of the incident, the time of referral and the decision made was documented. The notes of these patients were reviewed 12 months later for the results of prospective HIV test after each incident. There were 76 referrals to the GUM Department in year 2001. Occupational Health (OH) and the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Departments each made 35 referrals. The latter cases were exposures in community settings. Amongst A&E referrals the time interval between the incident and assessment was significantly longer than for OH referrals (P=0.001). Female health workers reported exposure incidents sooner than their male counterparts (P=0.01). Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV was offered to 22 (29%) of 76 referred individuals, and was accepted by 13 (59%) persons. The course of PEP drugs was discontinued by five (38%) of the 13 individuals after consented post-incident HIV testing of the source patients showed that they were HIV-seronegative. Five of eight individuals completed the course of PEP medication. Only 11 (14%) persons attended for serological testing for blood-borne virus infection three or more months after exposure. None of these 11 persons, one of whom had been given PEP medication, had become infected. Further training and emphasis on the necessity of immediate reporting of occupational incidents and consented post-incident HIV testing of the source patient is needed. The current guidelines appear to work fairly well, but further counselling of those with significant injuries to undertake HIV serological testing after appropriate time interval is required."

The hybridization patterns of HBV DNA were different in the nontumor and tumor parts in 26 (96.3%) of the 27 HBsAg-positive patients. In the nontumor parts, integration of HBV DNA into the host genome was significantly less when compared to the tumor parts (15/27 vs. 25/27, P less than 0.05), whereas free replicative viral forms were significantly more frequent (17/27 vs. 7/27). The integrated HBV DNA in the nontumor parts showed discrete band patterns in the majority of cases (13/15). Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) was significantly associated with the expression of free replicative forms of HBV DNA in the tumor tissues. An integrated HBV DNA sequence was detected in the tumor part of one HBsAg-negative patient, but not in her nontumor counterpart. Our observation that discrete integrated HBV DNAs are present in the nontumor part, representing subclinical clonal expansion that precedes the development of HCC, suggests the risk of future new tumor growth from these cell clones."
9275,0.005,1.0000,"Coumarins and structurally related compounds have been recently shown to present anti-human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) activity. Among them, the dietary furanocoumarin imperatorin is present in citrus fruits, in culinary herbs, and in some medicinal plants. In this study we report that imperatorin inhibits either vesicular stomatitis virus-pseudotyped or gp160-enveloped recombinant HIV-1 infection in several T cell lines and in HeLa cells. These recombinant viruses express luciferase as a marker of viral replication. Imperatorin did not inhibit the reverse transcription nor the integration steps in the viral cell cycle. Using several 5' long terminal repeat-HIV-1 constructs where critical response elements were either deleted or mutated, we found that the transcription factor Sp1 is critical for the inhibitory activity of imperatorin induced by both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and HIV-1 Tat. Moreover in transient transfections imperatorin specifically inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced transcriptional activity of the Gal4-Sp1 fusion protein. Since Sp1 is also implicated in cell cycle progression we further studied the effect of imperatorin on cyclin D1 gene transcription and protein expression and in HeLa cell cycle progression. We found that imperatorin strongly inhibited cyclin D1 expression and arrested the cells at the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. These results highlight the potential of Sp1 transcription factor as a target for natural anti-HIV-1 compounds such as furanocoumarins that might have a potential therapeutic role in the management of AIDS."

HIV vertical transmission occurred from 42 HCV-infected mothers (26.1%) versus 53 HCV-uninfected mothers (16.3%; odds radio [OR], 1.82; P = .01). In a logistic regression model that included maternal drug use, a potential confounder, HCV infection was marginally associated with perinatal HIV transmission (OR, 1.64; P = .05), whereas drug use was not. Women who transmitted HIV had higher levels of HCV RNA (median, 721,254 copies/mL) than those who did not (337,561 copies/mL; P = .01). Maternal HCV infection is associated with increased HIV vertical transmission. Further studies are needed to ascertain if HCV directly affects perinatal HIV transmission or is a marker for another factor, such as maternal drug use."
7866,0.005,1.0000,"We performed a computerized search on sulfadiazine-associated nephrotoxicity reported in human immunodefiency virus (HIV)-infected patients in the international literature. Including an original case report, we summarized 35 acquired immunodefiency syndrome (AIDS) patients from 1987 to 1995 in an analysis comparing their features to historical HIV-negative controls from the 1940s and 1950s. Likely due to a high prevalence of potential risk factors, incidence of sulfadiazine-associated renal impairment was 1.9%-7.5% in AIDS patients and 1%-4% in HIV-negative controls. Its occurrence appeared to be delayed in HIV-infected patients with a median of about 3 weeks of medication compared with about 10 days in HIV-negative subjects. Correspondingly, the cumulative sulfadiazine dose at manifestation doubled in AIDS patients with a median of 84 g versus 40 g in controls. Patients usually presented with flank or lumbar pain, oliguria, and (macro) hematuria. Urinalysis showed typical ""sheaves of wheat"" crystalluria, erythrozyturia, and, less commonly, leukozyturia and proteinuria. Echogenic (mostly peripelvic) densities, renal stones, and hydronephrosis are frequent findings on ultrasound examination, whereas X-ray examination possesses a low diagnostic sensitivity. The principle aim of therapy in these patients is to (re)institute the physicochemical urinary solubility of sulfadiazine and its metabolites. For this purpose, forced rehydration and, most importantly, urine alkalinization proved to be effective measures without an absolute need to withhold the drug. Provided prophylactic and therapeutic recommendations are complied with, outcome of this drug-related side effect is usually excellent, and rare relapses will similarly respond well."

Definition of the natural variation in drug susceptibility in wild-type human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 isolates is necessary to determine the prevalence of innate drug resistance and to assess the capability of the PhenoSense assay to reliably measure subtle reductions in drug susceptibility. The biological cutoffs for each drug, defined by the 99th percentile of the fold change in the 50% inhibitory concentration distributions or the mean fold change plus 2 standard deviations, were lower than those previously reported for other phenotypic assays and lower than the clinically relevant cutoffs previously defined for the PhenoSense assay. The 99th percentile fold change values ranged from 1.2 (tenofovir) to 1.8 (zidovudine) for nucleoside reverse transcriptase RT inhibitors (RTIs), from 3.0 (efavirenz) to 6.2 (delavirdine) for nonnucleoside RTIs, and from 1.6 (lopinavir) to 3.6 (nelfinavir) for protease inhibitors. To evaluate the potential role of intrinsic assay variability in the observed variations in the drug susceptibilities of wild-type isolates, 10 reference viruses with different drug susceptibility patterns were tested 8 to 30 times each. The median coefficients of variation in fold change for the reference viruses ranged from 12 to 18% for all drugs except zidovudine (32%), strongly suggesting that the observed differences in wild-type virus susceptibility to the different drugs is related to intrinsic virus variability rather than assay variability. The low biological cutoffs and assay variability suggest that the PhenoSense HIV assay may assist in defining clinically relevant susceptibility cutoffs for resistance to antiretroviral drugs."
3377,0.005,1.0000,"Osteoporosis is increasingly reported in the aging HIV-positive population, and co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) may further increase the risk of osteoporosis. However, it remains unclear whether HCV-related increased fracture risk is a function of the severity of liver disease. We calculated the time-updated alanine aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) score (an indirect marker of hepatic fibrosis) in all HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Veterans Affairs' Clinical Case Registry between 1984 and 2009. The association between HCV co-infection and incident osteoporotic fracture (defined as closed wrist, vertebral, or hip fracture) was assessed in univariate and multivariate Cox survival models adjusting for traditional risk factors for osteoporosis and APRI score or the presence of cirrhosis. A total of 772 osteoporotic fractures were identified among 56,660 HIV-infected patients (98.1% male; 31.3% HCV co-infected; median age 44.0 years) contributing 305,237 patient-years of follow-up. Fracture rates were significantly higher among HIV/HCV patients than HIV-only patients (2.57 versus 2.07/1000 patient-years, relative risk = 1.24, p < 0.0001). In a Cox multivariable model including age, race, smoking, drug use, body mass index, and antiretroviral therapy, HCV co-infection remained an independent predictor of osteoporotic fractures after controlling for presence of cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR]‚Äâ= 1.32; p <0.001) or APRI score (HR = 1.30; p = 0.003). Among HIV/HCV co-infected patients, cirrhosis strongly predicted osteoporotic fractures (HR = 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-2.44; p = 0.012), but APRI score was a weaker predictor (HR = 1.008; 95% CI 1.002-1.014; p = 0.015). In conclusion, among HIV-infected patients, severity of liver disease partly explains the HCV-associated increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Other determinants of this increased risk remain to be defined."
8040,0.005,1.0000,"Severe pain is a prominent characteristic of many rheumatic conditions occurring in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. These conditions may affect joints or soft tissues. Some painful syndromes, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome-associated arthritis, may be unique to HIV-infected individuals, whereas others, such as Reiter's syndrome, may also occur in patients without HIV infection but appear more severe in infected patients. Joint and soft tissue pain is usually most intense in the lower extremities. The pathogenesis of the pain is not completely understood but may involve subclinical neuropathic disease."
1153,0.005,1.0000,"Current guidelines recommend commencing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected patients when CD4 T-cell counts reach 350 cells/microL. However, late-presenting HIV-infected patients with CD4 T-cell counts<50 cells/microL are still common. The ability of long-term HAART to normalize immune dysregulation in severely immunodeficient HIV-infected patients remains unclear. Here we address indices of immune dysregulation in previously severely immunocompromised HIV-infected patients treated with long-term HAART who had achieved increased CD4 T-cell counts and complete suppression of HIV viraemia."
498,0.005,1.0000,"Diffuse fusiform intracranial aneurysms have been reported in children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for over 2 decades, but have only recently been reported in adults with HIV. Although these aneurysms have important clinical implications, their etiology and optimal therapy are unknown. We present a systematic review of diffuse intracranial fusiform aneurysmal vasculopathy in patients who are HIV-positive. We conducted a comprehensive literature search for relevant case reports and reviews published before February 2009. Patients were included if they had HIV infection and radiographic imaging consistent with fusiform aneurysmal vasculopathy. We identify 11 published adult cases of intracranial fusiform aneurysmal vasculopathy and describe 1 unpublished case from our own institution. Available data regarding clinical presentation, characteristic imaging findings, and treatment of this complex syndrome are reviewed. Adults with HIV-associated intracranial aneurysmal vasculopathy typically are significantly immunosuppressed and present with gross neurologic dysfunction. Characteristic radiographic findings include diffuse cerebral fusiform aneurysms with hemorrhage or infarct. Treatment of any active infection followed by the initiation of antiretroviral therapy and corticosteroids may be a reasonable approach in this complex syndrome."
609,0.005,1.0000,"Cryptosporidium spp. and Cystoisospora belli are monoxenic protozoa that have been recognized as the causative agents of chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals, especially HIV-infected subjects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of these intestinal protozoa in HIV-positive patients in the Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro region of Brazil and to correlate the presence of these infections with clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data of the patients. Oocysts were detected in stool samples of 10 (16.9%) of the 59 patients studied, while Cryptosporidium spp. were present in 10.1% (6/59) and C. belli in 6.7% (4/59). The frequency of these parasites was higher among patients with diarrheic syndrome and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts < 200 cells/mm 3 , demonstrating the opportunistic characteristic of these infections. A significant association was observed between the lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy and the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and/or C. belli. Parasitism with Cryptosporidium spp. was more frequent in February and April, the months following the period of high rainfall. The same was not observed for C. belli. Genetic characterization of two isolates led to the identification of Cryptosporidium parvum, one of the main species associated with the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis."
885,0.005,1.0000,"Since the description of a new renal syndrome in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the middle 1980s, much has been learned regarding the association of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and renal disease. The HIV-associated renal diseases represent a spectrum of clinical and histopathologic conditions. In this review, epidemiologic and clinical aspects of HIV-associated renal diseases are presented. Particular attention is placed on the pathologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in HIV-associated focal glomerulosclerosis, immune complex-mediated disease, and thrombotic microangiopathies. Pharmaceutical treatment options, including the use of glucocorticoids, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and highly active antiretroviral therapy, are discussed. The therapeutic option of renal transplantation is presented, with insight into new clinical and basic research supporting a possible role of immunosuppressive therapy in this already immunocompromised patient population."
2604,0.005,1.0000,"It has become clear that the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome follows continuous replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a decrease in immune capability, most obviously a decline in the number of CD4 lymphocytes. An understanding of key elements in the infectious life cycle of HIV has led to the development of potent antiretroviral drugs selectively targeting unique reverse transcriptase and protease enzymes of the virus. Completed clinical trials have shown that antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection, begun early, reduces viral replication and reverses the decline in CD4 lymphocyte numbers. Recent studies of combination therapies have shown that decreases in plasma HIV viremia to low levels and sustained increases in CD4 cell numbers are associated with longer survival. Potent combination regimens including protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors suppress detectable viral replication and have demonstrated clinical benefits in patients with advanced disease. Progress in antiretroviral therapy and methods to monitor responses to treatment are providing new hope in the treatment of HIV infection."
1788,0.005,1.0000,"Two major groups of renal complications in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease are a spectrum of disorders that result in potentially reversible acute renal failure, primarily acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), predominantly focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Fluid-electrolyte and acid-base derangements frequently encountered in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are major risk factors for the development of acute renal failure (ARF). HIVAN is an unusual form of poorly responsive glomerular disease characterized by nephrotic syndrome, FSGS, and a rapid fulminant progression to ESRD. ARF syndromes encountered in HIV patients are diverse in nature; many are similar to that in non-HIV subjects, whereas some are more common and unique. In general, HIV disease patients with ARF are younger and much sicker. Although ATN secondary to ischemic and toxic injuries is the commonest ARF syndrome, urinary obstruction is a rare cause of severe renal failure. In many AIDS patients afflicted with complicated infections and multi-organ failure, ATN is a terminal event, whereas in others treated aggressively, ARF is associated with good prognosis. In our large comparative study of severe ARF, recovery of renal function and mortality were determined by patient's general hemodynamic status, and not by the presence or absence of HIV infection. The prognosis of hemolytic uremic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura syndromes often observed in HIV patients is much worse than in non-HIV patients. The syndrome of crystalluria-induced ARF is common, and protease inhibitor induced disease is confined to HIV patients."
8865,0.005,1.0000,"The deleterious effect of HIV on the immune system begins at the time of infection. At seroconversion the virologic and immunologic factors that ultimately will dictate the rate of disease progression are believed to be already in place. The concept developed in this paper implies that, to impact significantly on the progression of disease, anti-HIV therapies should be initiated as early as possible in asymptomatic individuals. Published results have shown that combination drug therapies are potent in reducing HIV-1 RNA load in plasma in asymptomatic individuals, and that some HIV-1 immune-based therapies have a positive impact on immunological markers of disease progression, including HIV-1 cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and CD4 percent. The strategy discussed is to test a combination of antiretroviral therapy with HIV-1 immune-based therapy, such as the inactivated HIV-1 immunogen preparation, in asymptomatic individuals. The goal of this combination approach is to overcome the limitations of each therapy alone. Preliminary data suggest that antiretroviral therapy and the HIV-1 Immunogen can be combined with no noticeable interference and/or added toxicity in a broad range of HIV-1-infected individuals. Combining both therapies may enhance and expand the impact on key surrogate markers of disease progression, although they likely achieve this impact through different mechanisms. Thus, the primary question remains: Can these effects be synergistic?"
8489,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this retrospective study was the identification of clinically useful viral determinants for the prediction of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance and sustained virological response in hepatitis B virus/human immunodeficiency virus (HBV-/HIV)-coinfected patients receiving HBV-active combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Quantification of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA before and after initiation of HBV-active cART in a cohort of 59 HIV-/HBV-coinfected patients was performed. Calculations of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used for the identification of predictors of HBsAg seroclearance for HBeAg-positive [HBeAg(+); n = 36] and HBeAg-negative [HBeAg(-);n = 23] patients. HBeAg(+) patients with an HBsAg on-treatment decline ‚â• 1 log IU/mL per year achieved higher HBsAg loss rates (P = 0.0294), whereas the quantification of HBeAg had no predictive value for HBsAg seroclearance. Among HBeAg(-) patients, a pretreatment baseline cut-off level of HBsAg ‚â§ 100 IU/mL was highly predictive for HBsAg seroclearance. No significant influence of the HBV genotype on HBsAg seroclearance was observed among the entire cohort. Quantitative determination of HBsAg provides a clinically useful viral parameter for the prediction of HBsAg seroclearance both in HBeAg(+) and HBeAg(-) HIV-/HBV-coinfected patients receiving HBV-active cART."
9717,0.005,1.0000,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can improve immune system function through suppression of HIV-1 replication. However, paradoxical immune response may develop in some patients as a result of effective therapy followed by immune restoration. The phenomena is known as IRS, immune reconstitution syndrome/immune recovery syndrome. IRS can develop within weeks to months after cART is commenced and the time is related to the type of the disease. There are but scant reports concerning IRS-NHL (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) in HIV-1 positive subjects. We observed 4 (33%) cases of IRS-NHL out of 12 patients in whom NHL was diagnosed. As a result of potent cART they reached viral suppression in a mean time of 15 weeks followed by a rise in CD4(+) T cells within 16.5 weeks. The diagnosis of NHL was established at a mean time of 36 weeks after cART was introduced and 20 weeks after the CD4 T cell increase was achieved. This may indicate that the immune reconstitution as a result of cART was a predisposing factor for the development of NHL in our patients. There was prompt progression of the disease and the outcome was fatal in all cases. IRS-NHL should be suspected in any case of lymphadenopathy, generalized or limited to the abdomen or periphery, which develops after immune recovery due to potent cART within a few months."
6537,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is regarded as sole marker of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Bangladesh and most other developing countries. However, some HBV-negative subjects may harbor HBV DNA and transfusion of their blood may cause HBV infection in recipients. HBV DNA was checked in 20 patients with cryptogenic liver cirrhosis, 10 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma without any known etiology, and 10 apparently healthy subjects with elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). HBV DNA was detected in 8 of 20 patients with cryptogenic liver cirrhosis, 1 of 10 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and 2 of 10 apparent healthy subjects with elevated ALT. However, all of them were negative for HBsAg in the sera. This study indicates that some additional mechanisms should be developed for detection of HBsAg-negative HBV-infected subjects for efficient control and management of HBV infection in Bangladesh."
2950,0.005,1.0000,"The effect of coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) on immune restoration in 39 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients during treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) was prospectively evaluated. After 48 weeks of treatment, HCV-coinfected patients had lower increases in CD4% (P = .05), total CD4+ (P = .01), and na√Øve CD4+ (P = .06) T cells than did single-infected subjects. Higher baseline na√Øve CD4+ T-cell levels were associated with better CD4+ (P = .05) and na√Øve CD4+ (P < .001) T-cell recovery. After a 4-year follow up, the differences disappeared (median CD4+ increase: 291 and 306 cells for HCV-positive and HCV-negative patients, respectively, P = .9). No significant differences were seen in memory CD4+ T cells (P = .30), and CD8+ cells expressing CD38 (P = .10) and CD28 (P = .73). These results suggest that, independently of other factors, infection with HCV blunts early CD4+ T-cell recovery in HIV-infected patients treated with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, as good control of viral replication is maintained, satisfactory long-term immune restoration can nonetheless be achieved."
529,0.005,1.0000,"It is known that the 5%-10% of adults infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) develop a chronic infection and that HBV infection acquired at birth by an hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)/hepatitis B ""e"" antigen (HBeAg)-positive mother almost invariably leads to chronic infection. Little information is, however, available about the risk of HBV infection acquired in childhood becoming chronic. We have, therefore, studied the chronicity rate of HBV infection in the families of 60 consecutive HBsAg-positive chronic carrier children. Of parents 81.5% and 78.6% of children showed serological evidence of past or ongoing HBV infection. The chronicity rate was significantly higher among children (73.4%) than parents (35.6%). Such a high chronicity rate in these children was not correlated with vertical transmission, since this was reported in only 1.7% of them. It is noteworthy that the chronicity rate of HBV infection was not significantly different between children of HBsAg-positive mothers and those in whom infection must have been horizontally transmitted because their mothers were HBsAg-negative. Although the families studied represent a selected sample and the role of genetic factors could not be excluded, our results seem to show that the most important factor in determining the outcome of infection is the acquisition of hepatitis B during childhood."
7752,0.005,1.0000,"We investigated the expression of Pre-S2 antigen (Ag) and antibody (Ab) in sera quantitatively using ELISA. Four patients with acute hepatitis B and 87 chronic HBV carriers were included in this study. We also investigated the expression of Pre-S2Ag in the liver tissues obtained from 26 chronic HBV carriers by direct fluorescent antibody method. There was a significant correlation between Pre-S2Ag titers and HBsAg titers in sera. Pre-S2Ag titers were higher in sera positive for HBeAg, HBV-related DNA polymerase or HBV-DNA than in sera negative for those markers. The ratio of Pre-S2Ag titers to HBsAg titers, however, was constant irrespective of virus replicative markers. Pre-S2Ag in the liver had almost same intracellular localization with HBsAg in the liver. It was suggested that Pre-S2Ag was expressed with an intimate relation to the expression of HBsAg and was not useful as a virus replicative marker. Pre-S2Ag titers/HBsAg titers tended to be high in patients with chronic active hepatitis and high serum GPT levels compared to patients with chronic inactive hepatitis. This may be explained by the release of Pre-S2Ag in the liver. In addition, all patients positive for Pre-S2Ag on the membrane of hepatocytes had chronic active hepatitis. The overproduction of Pre-S2-containing surface proteins in the liver may have some implication related to cell injury via the immune response to Pre-S2Ag etc. Pre-S2Ab was detected only in few cases of chronic HBV infected patients. The lack of immune response to Pre-S2 region may play a role in the persistence of HBV infection."
582,0.005,1.0000,"The current study investigated the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection on the rate of change of antiretroviral drugs after the initiation of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). The data on 1425 HIV-positive patients with recorded serology for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were retrospectively analysed. The estimated rate of treatment change was slightly higher in the HBsAg-positive group (0.57 per year) compared with the HBsAg-negative group (0.50 per year). Although this difference was insignificant in multivariable modelling, the confidence intervals of the estimates barely included unity. Antiretroviral drug family, calendar period, prior exposure to antiretrovirals and the diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were independently associated with the number of drug alterations. A slight impact of co-infection on the frequency of treatment change after the beginning of HAART cannot be excluded. However, the paucity of studies on this issue necessitates the conduct of further research."
1632,0.005,1.0000,"The association of viremia, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and hepatocyte inflammatory activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients was studied. Serum samples from 114 HCC patients undergoing surgery were assayed for hepatitis B, C, and D viral nucleic acids by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to surgery. Of these patients, 65 had HBV infection alone, 15 had HCV infection alone, 4 had HDV infection, 20 had HBV and HCV superinfection, 1 had triple viral infection, and 9 were negative for HBV and HCV infections. The prevalence of active viral replication was significantly higher in HCV than in HBV (92% versus 70%; P = 0.006) patients, and significantly higher mean serum ALT levels were also noted in the HCV group than in the HBV group (P = 0.02). The incidence of marked ALT elevation (>200 U/l) was highest in the HCV (27%) and the HDV (25%) groups. Patients in the HCV group were 10 years older than those in the HBV group. Viral superinfection did not accelerate the development of HCC. Viral replication persisted in a significant portion of HCC patients and a higher prevalence of hepatic inflammation was noted in patients with HCV- and, possibly, HDV-related HCC."
4550,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1-associated dementia (HIV-D) remains a significant consequence of HIV-1 infection and AIDS. Since the clinical introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of HIV-D has decreased, yet the prevalence has increased as patients are living longer under treatment. Additionally, a less severe form of HIV-D, minor cognitive motor disorder, has become an increasing issue. Two different models have been proposed for virus entry in the central nervous system (CNS) in HIV-D. In the 'Trojan horse' model, the virus enters the CNS early carried by macrophages and infects resident glia; later in the course of infection, virus replication is activated and additional monocyte/macrophages are recruited into the CNS via cytokine/chemokine networks and endothelial-cell-leukocyte interactions at the blood-brain barrier. In the 'late invasion' model, an inherently invasive activated monocyte subset is expanded from bone marrow as a result of immune dysregulation in the periphery in the setting of AIDS. In this review we discuss these two separate, although not mutually exclusive, means for virus entry and persistence in the CNS. Additionally, we explore mechanisms for neuronal injury and apoptosis, including the role of virus, viral and host proteins, oxidative stress and products of infected or uninfected activated microglia and astrocytes. Potential therapeutic strategies are also briefly discussed."
140,0.005,1.0000,"A population-based survey was carried out in the Kagera region of the United Republic of Tanzania in 1987 to determine the magnitude of HIV-1 infection and to study associated risk factors. The region was divided into one urban and three rural zones. A multistage cluster sampling technique was adopted. Antibodies to HIV-1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by Western blot analysis. A total of 2,475 adults (aged 15-54 years) and 1,961 children (aged 0-14 years) was studied. The overall prevalence of HIV-1 infection among adults was 9.6%, with a higher prevalence in the urban zone (24.2%) than in the three rural zones (10.0, 4.5 and 0.4%, respectively). The corresponding figures for children were 1.3% overall: 3.9% in the urban area and for the rural areas 1.2, 0.8 and 0.0%, respectively. The age-specific seroprevalence for adults was highest in the age group 25-34 years. The age-standardized sex-specific prevalence was higher among women than men in the urban zone, while it was the same in the rural zones. Change of sexual partners among adults was associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 seropositivity. Travelling outside the region but within the country was also found to be associated with increased risk of HIV-1 infection but only in the rural population."
5369,0.005,1.0000,"HBsAg point mutations within the major hydrophilic region (MHR) have frequently been reported to be associated with diagnostic failure, vaccine escape and immunotherapy escape. However, the prevalence of escape mutations in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients has not been systematically studied in patients from southern China within the past decade. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of escape mutations within the MHR of hepatitis B virus in patients in Dongguan, southern China. Between June 2015 and May 2016, 391 patients who were chronically infected with HBV were enrolled in the study, including 240 patients with the genotype B strain and 151 with the genotype C strain. The most frequent mutated position was s126 (4.3%), followed by s100 (3.3%), s101 (2.8%), s133 (2.8%), s145 (2.3%), s120 (2.0%) and s129 (1.8%). Furthermore, the mutations sY100C, sQ101R/K, sS114A, sP120T, sT/I126A/N/S, sQ129R, sM133L/T/S and sG145R/A were prevalent in at least one genotype, with a frequency higher than 1%, which indicated that these mutations were relatively common. In addition, sQ101K/R was found only in genotype C isolates (P < 0.05), and sT126A was only discovered in genotype B isolates (P = 0.047), indicating that such mutations were genotype-associated mutations. Notably, combinations of escape mutations within the MHR were also frequently discovered in genotypes B (5.0%) and C (6.6%), with no significant difference (P = 0.498). These results indicated that we should increase the surveillance HBsAg mutations among HBV-infected patients in China."
4681,0.005,1.0000,"This report describes a cross-sectional survey of the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) in a rural Egyptian community in the Nile Delta. One half of the village households were systematically selected and examined by questionnaire and testing sera for anti-HCV and HCV RNA. Blood samples were obtained from 3, 888 (75.4%) of 5,156 residents >/=5 years of age; an additional 111 samples were obtained from children younger than 5 years. Overall, 973 (24.3%) of 3,999 residents were anti-HCV-positive, and the age- and gender-adjusted seroprevalence was 23.7%. Anti-HCV prevalence increased sharply with age, from 9.3% in those 20 years of age and younger to >50% in those older than 35 years. Currently or previously married individuals were more likely to be seropositive than those never married, controlling for age (Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.6). Of the 905 anti-HCV-positive samples tested, 65% were also positive for HCV RNA. Active schistosomal infection was not associated with anti-HCV status; however, history of antischistosomal injection therapy (reported by 19% of anti-HCV positives) was a risk for anti-HCV (age-adjusted risk ratio = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.2, 1.5). This study, the largest community-based survey to date, supports earlier reports of high levels of anti-HCV among adults in rural areas of Egypt, although many of those who are seropositive will not have active liver disease. The large reservoir of HCV infection in the community provides an opportunity to investigate risk factors for transmission, the natural history of infection and effectiveness of preventive methodologies, and raises concern about the prospect of an increasing incidence of chronic liver disease in the coming decades."
7324,0.005,1.0000,"The northern treeshrew (Tupaia belangeri) has been reported to be an effective candidate for animal infection model with hepatitis B virus (HBV). The objective of our study was to analyze the growth characteristics of HBV in tupaia hepatocytes and the host response to HBV infection. We established primary tupaia hepatocytes (3-6-week old tupaia) and infected them with HBV genotypes A, B and C, and all the genotypes proliferated as well as those in human primary hepatocytes (>10(5) copies/ml in culture supernatant). We next generated a chimeric mouse with tupaia liver by transplantation of tupaia primary hepatocytes to urokinase-type plasminogen activator cDNA (cDNA-uPA)/severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice and the replacement ratio with tupaia hepatocytes was found to be more than 95%. Infection of chimeric mice with HBV (genotypes B, C, and D) resulted in HBV-DNA level of 10(4)-10(6) copies/ml after 8 weeks of infection, which were almost similar to that in humanized chimeric mouse. In contrast, serum HBV level in adult tupaia (1-year-old tupaia) was quite low (<10(3) copies/ml). Understanding the differences in the response to HBV infection in primary tupaia hepatocytes, chimeric mouse, and adult tupaia will contribute to elucidating the mechanism of persistent HBV infection and viral eradication. Thus, T. belangeri was found to be efficient for studying the host response to HBV infection, thereby providing novel insight into the pathogenesis of HBV. "
8971,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B infection (HBV) is a major health problem worldwide. The prognosis is grave for patients with HBV-related decompensated liver cirrhosis (LC). We evaluated the effectiveness and the determinants of early mortality of lamivudine treatment in patients with HBV-related decompensated LC. Thirty patients with HBV-related decompensated LC and active viral replication were treated with lamivudine 100 mg daily for a median duration of 9 months. Among these patients, five patients died within 3 months. Two patients were lost to follow-up at week 8 and 9. One patient was treated for <6 months. Twenty-two patients were treated over 6 months. Univariate analysis revealed that the total bilirubin (P = 0.008), prothrombin time (P = 0.004), Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (P = 0.005), the model of efd-stage liver disease score (P = 0.004) and stage III hepatic encephalopathy (P = 0.001) were predictive factors of early mortality. Multivariate analysis revealed that the independent factor associated with early mortality was stage III encephalopathy. Among 22 patients, liver function improved markedly after lamivudine therapy. Of the nine hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients, three had HBeAg seroconversion. Two patients had YMDD mutant and virological breakthrough at 41 and 46 weeks. One of the two had hepatocellular carcinoma and died of hepatic failure at week 125; the other received adefovir and is doing well. Lamivudine appeared to have benefits in viral suppression and significant improvement in liver function in patients with HBV-related decompensated LC. As noted in prior studies, poor baseline liver function is associated with a poor prognosis in Asian patients with decompensated HBV cirrhosis treated with lamivudine."

HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc as HBV markers and anti-HCV (ELISA, Ortho) as an HCV marker were tested. Positive rates of HBsAg and anti HCV among blood donors were 7.1% and 3.1% respectively, and there was no significant difference among age groups. Donors negative for all viral markers accounted for 21.4%. Of acute hepatitis cases, 18 (23.1%) cases were hepatitis A and 8 (10.3%) cases were hepatitis B, one case of which was considered to be double infection. Acute exacerbation cases of HBV carriers were 16 (20.5%), of which 6 cases were positive for HCV antibody. Those diagnosed non-A, non-B hepatitis were 37 (47.4%), of which 3 cases where positive for HCV antibody. Blood samples from all of acute hepatitis cases were obtained within 1 week after onset of the disease, thus, it was not possible to accurately assess prevalence of hepatitis C. Positive rates on HBsAg among chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were 25.4%, 32.8% and 35.5% respectively, while those for HCV antibody were 16.3%, 43.1% and 35.5% respectively. Positive rates of HBsAg and HCV antibody for overall chronic liver diseases were 31.1% and 32.6%, and 14 (10.6%) were positive for both markers."
5108,0.005,1.0000,"High prevalence of tobacco use and low success in quitting remain significant problems for reducing disease burden among HIV-infected persons. This study's purpose was to examine participant responsiveness and tobacco dependence treatment adherence and their influences on tobacco abstinence among HIV-infected patients. This non-randomized study included HIV-infected smokers 18 years of age or older, who smoked at least 5 cigarettes per day, and had an interest in quitting smoking in the next 30 days. HIV-infected smokers (n = 247) received a 12-week tobacco dependence treatment intervention that included pharmacotherapy and telephone counseling. Younger age and non-White race were associated with lower adherence to pharmacotherapy. Younger age, non-White race, and increased monthly binge drinking were associated with lower adherence to telephone counseling. High participant responsiveness was associated with adherence to pharmacotherapy, counseling, and abstinence. Development and testing of interventions to improve adherence to evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment is warranted."
4511,0.005,1.0000,"The evolutionary rate of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is considered to be very low, in strong contrast to the related human retrovirus HIV. However, current estimates of the HTLV-1 rate rely on the anthropological calibration of phylogenies using assumed dates of human migration events. To obtain an independent rate estimate, we analyzed two variable regions of the HTLV-1 genome (LTR and env) from eight infected families. Remarkable genetic stability was observed, as only two mutations in LTR (756 bp) and three mutations in env (522 bp) occurred within the 16 vertical transmission chains, including one ambiguous position in each region. The evolutionary rate in HTLV-1 was then calculated using a maximum-likelihood approach that used the highest and lowest possible times of HTLV-1 shared ancestry, given the known transmission histories. The rates for the LTR and env regions were 9.58 x 10(-8)-1.25 x 10(-5) and 7.84 x 10(-7) -2.33 x 10(-5)nucleotide substitutions per site per year, respectively. A more precise estimate was obtained for the combined LTR-env data set, which was 7.06 x 10(-7)-1.38 x 10(-5)substitutions per site per year. We also note an interesting correlation between the occurrence of mutations in HTLV-1 and the age of the individual infected."
3810,0.005,1.0000,"Within human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients, there are those who have been infected for more than 10 years with a CD4+ cell count of >500 cells microl(-1) and who remain asymptomatic without antiretroviral therapy; these patients are designated long-term non-progressors (LTNPs). In a set of 16 LTNPs, viral dating, DNA viral load, quasispecies heterogeneity and antibody (Ab) titres against gp160 and beta2 microglobulin (beta2m) were determined. Plasma viral RNA and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell numbers were estimated in more than three samples per patient. Host genetic characteristics, such as Delta32-CCR5 genotype and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype and supertypes, and clinical-epidemiological factors were evaluated. Dating of global populations and of DNA and RNA viral quasispecies identified two subsets of patients: one displaying only ancestral sequences and the other displaying predominantly modern sequences. The ancestral patients displayed a significant reduction in RNA and DNA viral loads, quasispecies heterogeneity, CD8+ cell number, anti-gp160 Ab titres and beta2m level, and they were also associated with better use of safe-sex practices and higher presence of the HLA sB58 supertype than the modern subset. Viral dating has therefore permitted the segregation of LTNPs into two subsets that show very different virological, immunological, host and clinical-epidemiological characteristics. Moreover, whereas the modern subset displayed low levels of virus replication, the ancestral group displayed not only a very limited virus replication, often to undetectable levels, but also very slow or arrested viral evolution, maintaining the close relationship of the viral population to the transmitted virus."
6055,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes complex metabolic changes in infected CD4(+) T cells that lead to cell cycle arrest and cell death by necrosis. To study the viral functions responsible for deleterious effects on the host cell, we quantitated the course of HIV type 1 infection in tissue cultures by using flow cytometry for a virally encoded marker protein, heat-stable antigen (HSA). We found that HSA appeared on the surface of the target cells in two phases: passive acquisition due to association and fusion of virions with target cells, followed by active protein expression from transcription of the integrated provirus. The latter event was necessary for decreased target cell viability. We developed a general mathematical model of viral dynamics in vitro in terms of three effective time-dependent rates: those of cell proliferation, infection, and death. Using this model we show that the predominant contribution to the depletion of viable target cells results from direct cell death rather than cell cycle blockade. This allows us to derive accurate bounds on the time-dependent death rates of infected cells. We infer that the death rate of HIV-infected cells is 80 times greater than that of uninfected cells and that the elimination of the vpr protein reduces the death rate by half. Our approach provides a general method for estimating time-dependent death rates that can be applied to study the dynamics of other viruses."
2080,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) possesses the ability to establish a complete infection in nondividing host cells. The capacity of HIV-1 to infect nondividing cells probably contributes significantly to its pathology in vivo, as reflected by infection of peripheral T lymphocytes, tissue macrophages, and microglial cells. However, the in vitro demonstration of the establishment of stable HIV-1 infection in quiescent T cells remains controversial. We have developed a primary T-cell model of acute HIV-1 infection of quiescent CD4 lymphocytes that demonstrates the development of a complete, reverse-transcribed form of virus that is stable for over 10 days in culture. To ensure that our primary cell culture was representative of a quiescent population, the CD4 lymphocyte targets were monitored for membrane expression of activation antigens and for shifts in cell cycle from G0/G1 to S/G2 phase. The presence of viral DNA fragments reflecting progressive reverse transcription was determined by PCR analysis. HIV entered primary CD4 cells rapidly, but viral DNA accumulated slowly in the resting cell cultures. DNA species containing regions of full-length reverse transcription were not detected until 3 to 5 days after infection. In parallel with the appearance of complete viral DNA, spliced RNA transcripts, predominantly of the nef species, were detected by reverse transcriptase PCR amplification. When infected CD4 cells were sorted on the basis of cell cycle analysis of DNA content, the accumulation of a complete viral DNA form was found to occur in both the purified G0/G1-phase cell subset and the cell fraction enriched for the minor S-phase subset. In contrast, spliced viral RNA products could be detected only in the enriched S-phase cell fraction. These results demonstrate that HIV-1 can infect and establish a complete, stable form of viral DNA in primary CD4 lymphocytes in vitro but is blocked from transcription in the absence of cell activation. The findings are consistent with in vivo data from HIV-infected individuals that show the existence of viral DNA predominantly as a stable, extrachromosomal form in T cells of the peripheral circulation."
4134,0.005,1.0000,"The state of activation of the immune system may be an important factor which renders a host more receptive to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and more vulnerable to its effects. To explore this issue with a practical in vivo model, we developed a modified protocol of HIV infection in hu-PBL-SCID mice. First, we assessed the time course of activation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hu-PBL) in the peritoneal cavity of SCID mice. At 2 to 24 h after the intraperitoneal injection into SCID mice, there was a clear-cut increase in the percentage of hu-PBL expressing early activation markers (CD69), concomitant with the release of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and the soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and with the accumulation of mRNAs for a number of human cytokines. At 2 weeks, virtually all of the hu-PBL expressed the memory phenotype (CD45RO) and HLA-DR antigens as well. Cells collected from the SCID mouse peritoneum at 2 and 24 h after transplantation were fully susceptible to in vitro infection with HIV type 1 (HIV-1) in the absence of either IL-2 or mitogens. The injection of HIV into hu-PBL-SCID mice at 2 h after reconstitution resulted in a generalized and productive HIV infection of the xenochimeras. This early HIV-1 infection resulted in a dramatic depletion of human CD4+ cells and in decreased levels of sICAM-1 (in the peritoneal lavage fluid) as well as of sIL-2R and immunoglobulins M and A (in the serum). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or reverse transcriptase PCR analysis showed higher levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 in the HIV-infected animals than in control hu-PBL-SCID mice, while gamma interferon levels in the two groups were comparable. When we compared the current model of HIV-1 infection at 2 weeks after the intraperitoneal injection of the hu-PBL in the SCID mice with the model described here, we found that the majority of immune dysfunctions induced in the 2-h infection of the xenochimeras are not inducible in the 2-week infection. This supports the concept that the state of activation of human cells at the moment of the in vivo infection with HIV-1 is a crucial factor in determining the immune derangement observed in AIDS patients. These results show that some immunological dysfunctions induced by HIV infection in AIDS patients can be mimicked in this xenochimeric model. Thus, the hu-PBL-SCID mouse model may be useful in exploring, in vivo, the relevance of hu-PBL activation and differentiation in HIV-1 infection and for testing therapeutic intervention directed towards either the virus or the immune system."
2111,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of liver cell injury and viral clearance in HCV infection. Because HCV does not efficiently infect human cells in vitro and primary infected hepatocytes cannot be used as stimulator/target cells for CTL analysis, development of efficient systems to activate and expand CTL in vitro, reproducing antigen presentation to CTL occurring during natural infection, is mandatory to study CTL activity and to define the hierarchy of immunodominance of CTL epitopes. To achieve this goal, 5 different defective adenoviruses carrying structural and nonstructural HCV genes (core, core-E1-E2, E2, NS3-NS4A, NS3-NS5A) were used to induce the endogenous synthesis of HCV proteins in human adherent mononuclear cells in vitro and to allow their entry into the HLA class I cytosolic pathway of antigen processing. The cytolytic activity of peripheral blood lympho-mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HLA-A2(+) HCV-infected patients stimulated with recombinant adenovirus-infected cells was tested against target cells either pulsed with a panel of synthetic peptides containing the HLA-A2 binding motif or infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying HCV genes. Our study defines a reproducible system to stimulate and expand HCV-specific CTL in vitro that mimics the conditions of antigen encounter in vivo. By this approach, we have identified several HLA-A2-restricted epitopes that should correspond to immunodominant HCV sequences recognized by CTL during natural infection. Therefore, these amino acid sequences represent ideal candidates for the design of therapeutic vaccines for chronic HCV infection."
6372,0.005,1.0000,"This study examines the risk of developing cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis as a function of the duration and degree of CD4+ lymphocyte depletion. A retrospective analysis of 135 persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was performed. Kaplan-Meier estimates for the percentage of patients developing CMV retinitis during the 27-month study period were calculated. Twenty-six patients were diagnosed as having CMV retinitis. In 14 of these patients, T cell phenotyping was done within the 3 months preceding diagnosis. The mean CD4+ lymphocyte count for these patients was 15.6 cells/mm3 (range, 2-33/mm3). At 27 months, the percentage of patients developing CMV retinitis with baseline CD4+ lymphocyte counts of 0-50, 51-100, and 101-250 cells/mm3 was 41.9%, 26.3%, and 14.7%, respectively (log-rank test, p = 0.003). The odds ratio for developing CMV retinitis for those with baseline CD4+ lymphocyte counts of 0-50 cells/mm3 compared with those with CD4+ lymphocyte counts of 101-250 cells/mm3 was 4.62 (p = 0.002). Twenty-four patients had CD4+ lymphocyte counts of < or = 50 cells/mm3 for an average of 13.1 months prior to diagnosis. Twenty-two patients had an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness diagnosed for an average of 18.0 months prior to the onset of retinitis. CMV retinitis is most likely to develop in patients with AIDS when the CD4+ lymphocyte count is < or = 50 cells/mm3."
3464,0.005,1.0000,"Despite substantial benefits of HAART treatment of HIV-infected patients, cumulative long-term toxicity, including drug-induced hepatotoxicity, has emerged as an important complication. Thus, to examine the prevalence and risk of developing severe hepatic injury during HAART, we conducted a retrospective study in a cohort of 364 HIV-infected patients treated with HAART between January 1998 and May 2006, for whom data on alanine aminotransferase activity were available both before and during HAART. HCV co-infection was recorded in 35.4% of the series, but was found not to influence either the efficacy of HAART or survival (P>0.05). Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in a total of 24 patients (6.6%). Multivariate logistic regression defined HCV co-infection (OR 16.6, 95% CI 3.8-46.0, P<0.0001), and the use of SQV/RTV and d4T (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2-8.16, P=0.02, and OR 7.1, 95% CI 1.0-54.5, P=0.05, respectively) as independent risk factors for aggravation of hepatitis. In addition, there was a significant increase in the probability of developing liver damage over years of treatment (Log rank, P<0.01). Conversely, the probability of developing hepatotoxicity was not associated with an increase in the CD4 cell count to values greater than 350/microL (Log rank, P=0.59). In conclusion, in the setting of chronic viral hepatitis, hepatotoxicity during HAART may be attributed to the cumulative toxicity of drugs that induce mitochondrial toxicity, along with particular PIs and/or NNRTIs. Furthermore, our data suggest prudent use of D-drugs, still common in resource-limited countries, in HCV co-infected patients."
1948,0.005,1.0000,Minnesota is currently home to the tenth largest African population and the second largest East African population in the United States. HIV is increasingly being diagnosed in African-born persons in Minnesota. A retrospective survey was conducted on all African-born patients in our HIV clinic between January 1994 and June 2005. We identified 237 patients who were African-born and HIV-positive. They constituted 12% of patients attending the clinic within the study timeframe. There was no significant difference in the ages of the African-born and non-African patients in the HIV clinic. African-born patients were more likely to be women compared with non-African patients (p < 0.001). Forty-three percent of the African-born patients presented with AIDS as defined by CD4(+) T cell counts less than 200 cells per milliliter compared to 33% of antiretroviral na√Øve non-African HIV patients in the clinic (p < 0.001). Most patients were infected through heterosexual contact and only 4% were diagnosed as a result of routine testing. Seven known HIV subtypes and four unique recombinant forms were identified. The most common opportunistic infection was pulmonary tuberculosis. African immigrants with HIV appear to: (1) access care at later stages of HIV disease than other patients in our clinic; (2) are often infected with non-B subtypes; (3) do not routinely get tested for HIV. Increased awareness to this growing trend is needed for health care providers and public health officials to tailor educational programs and prevention efforts for African immigrants in the United States.
6302,0.005,1.0000,"In order to study the effect of increased CD4 cell counts on the biology of hepatitis C virus (HCV), we analyzed the genetic variability of HCV generated over 8 y in eight human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and HCV co-infected patients. This was a retrospective study in which HIV patients were selected who had profound immune impairment evident over four years and were co-infected with HCV genotype 1 and who then went on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). These patients achieved different degrees of immune reconstitution, measured as increased CD4 cell counts during a 4- to 8-y period, following initiation of HAART. HCV genetic variability was determined by measuring the genetic diversity (Hamming distance, HD), and complexity (number of viral variants) in plasma samples collected at yearly intervals just before and after the initiation of HAART. The parameters were assessed by molecular cloning and sequencing of a 575-bp fragment including the HCV envelope 1 and envelope 2 genes (E1/E2), containing the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1). significantly increased HVR1 genetic diversity was observed in analyzed samples where the patients' CD4 cell counts were > or =100 compared with CD4 cell counts <100. A significant increase in genetic diversity in HVR1 was detected in co-infected patients whose CD4 cell counts increased from <100 to >400 over a period of more than 4 y of HAART therapy. This was in contrast to a minimal increase in HCV genetic diversity of HVR1 occurring in patients whose CD4 cell counts failed to rise much over 200 over 7 y of follow up. Insertion and deletion of HCV genomic fragments in the E1/E2 region was documented in one patient who developed fulminant hepatitis C."
2347,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C is frequent and aggressive among HIV-positive patients; evaluation for anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific therapy is mandatory, but it has many limitations, due to efficacy, tolerability but also applicability. The objective of our retrospective analysis was to evaluate the eligibility and feasibility of anti-HCV therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients followed at the II Department of Infectious Diseases, L. Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy, from 2000 to March 2010. In our database, 545 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were present, representing 40% of our whole HIV population, and 421 included in the analysis. One hundred twenty-four patients were excluded because of loss to follow-up (81) or deceased (43). Forty-eight patients spontaneously cleared HCV during follow-up (11%). Ninety-nine patients received anti-HCV therapy (26%), while the majority was excluded for several reasons (mainly concomitant diseases and low CD4(+) cell count). Globally, we found that in at least one third of untreated patients modifiable barriers to treatment were present. The access to therapy was significantly associated with the absence of history of intravenous drug use (p=0.01), a higher CD4(+) cells count at nadir (p=0.01), the presence of more than 6 HAART regimens (p=0.04), higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (p<0.0001), HCV genotype 2 or 3 (p=0.005). In a multivariate analysis, the same factors remained significantly associated with anti-HCV therapy. In conclusion, the feasibility of anti-HCV therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, in our highly specialized center, is approximately 26%. Relative contraindications, such as substance abuses, mild and controlled concomitant conditions, and low compliance are common and modifiable in order to reconsider patients as suitable for therapy."
5528,0.005,1.0000,"To report long-term data on safety and effectiveness of antiretroviral regimens, including nevirapine. HIV-1-infected patients who received nevirapine-based approaches for at least 4 years were identified in the databases of five centers and included in a retrospective cohort study. Data collected included plasma HIV-RNA (viral load) and CD4+ T-cell counts, lipid and liver function tests, at baseline, 2-year and > 4-year time points. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection, adverse events, and reasons for using nevirapine were also recorded. Two hundred and twenty-nine patients (139 males/90 females) were included. The mean age was 37 years (range 20-59). Most patients (n = 124; 54%) were former intravenous drug users. One hundred and thirty-five of the patients (59%) were coinfected with HCV. Median time on nevirapine was 72.6 months. The main reasons for nevirapine use included: second- or third-line therapy (39%), simplification of therapy (29%), first-line therapy (18%) and efavirenz intolerance (9%). LDL cholesterol and triglycerides decreased during the >4-year follow-up (135 mg/dl to 109 mg/dl, p = 0.04; and 216 mg/dl to 153 mg/dl, p<0.01, respectively), and HDL cholesterol increased from 48 mg/dl at baseline to 62 mg/dl (p<0.01). Liver enzymes remained without significant changes during follow-up. The reported follow-up pattern of laboratory tests was also found in the subset of HCV-coinfected patients, where men and women were compared and patients with a CD4+ cell count cut-off value of 250/mm(3) were stratified. Mean CD4+ T-cell counts increased from 439/mm(3) at baseline to 628/mm(3) at the last available visit (p<0.001). Ninety-four per cent (172 out of 184) of patients who remained on nevirapine-based therapy at last visit maintained viral load values below the limit of detection (<50 copies/ml). Throughout the follow-up nevirapine was stopped or withdrawn in 43 patients due to virological failure (n = 17), toxicity (n = 5), therapy interruption (n = 3), death (n = 2), dyslipidemia (n = 1), simplification (n = 1) or unknown reasons (n = 14). Adverse events were reported in 40 patients but none was directly attributed to nevirapine. Nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy provides sustained immunological and virological effectiveness over a more than 4-year treatment period as well as a beneficial lipid metabolic profile and a favorable safety profile, even in HCV-coinfected patients and women with CD4+ cell counts above 250/mm(3). The study data support a nevirapine-based approach as a suitable long-term strategy in the HIV-1-infected population."
4921,0.005,1.0000,"The antiretroviral drug combination emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF/FTC) taken as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV infection, yet it also requires adherence and potentially decreases condom use. This study sought to examine these issues among a key population at risk of HIV infection, substance-using men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted semi-structured interviews with an ethnically diverse sample of 30 young (aged 20-35) MSM prescribed PrEP within a large integrated healthcare system in San Francisco, who had reported recent drug use or hazardous drinking and one or more missed doses of PrEP. We explored participants' risk perception and sexual risk behavior, drug and alcohol use, and PrEP adherence in the context of substance use. Interviews were transcribed and coded using a directed content analysis approach to identify key categories and commonalities, and differences across participants. Salient subcategories included positive psychological effects of being on PrEP (e.g., decreased anxiety, feelings of empowerment), social effects (e.g., reduced HIV stigma), and reduction in overall perceptions of HIV risk. While overall reported use of condoms went down and many reported a brief period of increased condomless sex following PrEP initiation, others continued condom use with most of their sexual partners. Contextual factors influencing their decision to engage in condomless sex included how well they knew the partner and whether the partner was on PrEP or HIV antiretroviral treatment. Factors associated with poor adherence included disruptions in daily routine and use of alcohol and methamphetamine. PrEP-prescribing clinicians should support their patients in making informed decisions about condom use and identifying strategies to maximize adherence in the context of substance use."
2419,0.005,1.0000,"Before December 1997, in Esp√≠rito Santo, Brazil, combination antiretroviral therapy was used without routine virologic or immunologic monitoring. To examine consequences of therapy in this setting, clinical information, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels, CD4 cell counts, and protease and reverse transcriptase sequences were determined for consecutive HIV-1-infected outpatients. Of 48 treatment-naive individuals, 11 were started on therapy for HIV-related symptoms; however, 44 (92%) had an RNA level >20,000 copies/mL, a CD4 cell count <500/mm3, or symptoms. Eighteen (51%) of 35 patients on therapy had an RNA level >20,000 copies/mL. Nucleoside-resistance mutations were observed in 21 (68%) of 31 nucleoside-experienced subjects. Protease mutations necessary for high-level protease inhibitor (PI) resistance were present together with permissive mutations in 3 of 10 PI-experienced patients. Inability to identify high-risk individuals and to detect virologic failure may limit the effectiveness of antiretroviral drug programs and may promote the spread of drug resistance where virologic and immunologic monitoring are not available."

Opportunistic infections should always be considered in the evaluation of symptomatic patients with advanced HIV/AIDS, although the overall incidence of these infections has decreased. Primary care of HIV infection includes the early detection of some complications through screening at-risk and symptomatic patients with routine laboratory monitoring (e.g., comprehensive metabolic and lipid panels) and validated tools (e.g., the HIV Dementia Scale). Treatment of many chronic complications is similar for patients with HIV infection and those without infection; however, combination antiretroviral therapy has shown benefit for some conditions, such as HIV-associated nephropathy. For other complications, such as cardiovascular disease and lipoatrophy, management may include switching antiretroviral regimens to reduce exposure to HIV medications known to cause toxicity."
5265,0.005,1.0000,"Although coinfection with hepatitis C (HCV) is an established risk factor for hepatotoxicity in HIV-positive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), specific variables that may be predictive of severe hepatotoxicity among co-infected patients receiving cART remain poorly defined. A retrospective cohort study of HIV/HCV coinfected adults from two HIV treatment centers covering the period between December 1998 and December 2003 was conducted to address this question. The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) during follow-up and the primary predictors of interest were specific antiretrovirals. One hundred five coinfected patients receiving cART for a median of 70 months (interquartile range [IQR], 37, 83) were included in the analysis. Twenty-three (22%) patients developed a grade 3 or 4 increase in serum ALT at least once in follow-up. In univariate analysis, current receipt of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (odds ratio [OR] 3.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-8.34, p = 0.03), baseline ALT (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p = 0.004), and current use of boosting ritonavir (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.16-7.00, p = 0.02) were significantly associated with a grade 3 or 4 increase in serum ALT, although most patients receiving boosting ritonavir were on lopinavir/ritonavir based regimens. Patients receiving LPV/r had been previously exposed to significantly more antiretrovirals (p < 0.0001), protease inhibitors (p < 0.0001), and nucleoside analogues (p = 0.0009) compared to the rest of the cohort.

4012,0.005,1.0000,"HIV is a pandemic disease, and many cellular and systemic factors are known to alter its infectivity and replication. Earlier studies had suggested that anemia is common in HIV-infected patients; however, higher iron was also observed in AIDS patients prior to the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Therefore, the relationship between iron and viral infection is not well delineated. To address this issue, we altered the levels of cellular iron in primary CD4(+) T cells and showed that higher iron is associated with increased HIV infection and replication. In addition, HIV infection alone leads to increased cellular iron, and several ART drugs increase cellular iron independent of HIV infection. Finally, HIV infection is associated with increased serum iron in HIV-positive patients regardless of treatment with ART. These results establish a relationship between iron and HIV infection and suggest that iron homeostasis may be a viable therapeutic target for HIV. "
8869,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has become widely available in China during the past seven years. However, many patients still initiate treatment at very late stages. To understand the distribution of baseline CD4 and factors associated with late antiretroviral therapy (ART) access, the National Free ART Database was retrospectively reviewed and a total of 49,321 HIV/AIDS patients were identified in this study based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) age ‚â•18; (2) initiated HAART between 1 July, 2006 and 31 December, 2009; (3) have recorded baseline CD4 cell count. This study showed that although both the median and mean baseline CD4 increased consistently over the study period, there were still about 30% of HIV/AIDS patients accessing ART at a very late stage (CD4 ‚â§ 50 ¬µl) in 2009. Risk factors for late ART access included being male, single, having a short time interval between HIV diagnosis and treatment, and being infected through heterosexual contact. Being infected through injection drug use and homosexual contact were protective. Transmission route and marriage status showed different effects in a gender stratified analysis. A strengthened HIV testing and screening program is the key to improving the accessibility of ART and populations that are vulnerable to sexual transmission of HIV should be the primary target of the program."
1939,0.005,1.0000,"Improving health literacy is a necessary intervention for people with chronic health conditions to ensure adherence with long or life therapies and increase participation in self-care. While adherence is a multifactorial process, increasing health literacy among HIV-infected patients at all stages of living with HIV has been shown to improve treatment outcomes. In the era of rapid scale up of HIV care and treatment, little has been done to evaluate the utility of information, education, and communication (IEC) materials for increasing patient health literacy and how patients perceive such materials. Four patient-oriented print IEC brochures in Kiswahili were designed to be read at the clinic waiting areas and also carried home by patients to supplement the knowledge received from routine counselling during clinic visits. Brochures detail antiretroviral therapy and address common myths, side effects, types and management of opportunistic infections, and prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV. We conducted focus group discussions with HIV-infected patients to explore patient perceptions of IEC materials in the urban congested HIV care setting of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Groups of participants were recruited from eight public PEPFAR-supported HIV care and treatment centres in the city (N = 50). In this paper we present the results of those focus group discussions and introduce the print IEC materials as a pilot intervention in a Kiswahili-speaking setting where a need for additional health literacy exists. Further evaluation of these materials will follow as the data becomes available."
291,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B and C virus infections are relatively common among patients with end-stage kidney disease on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients. These conditions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality after kidney transplant. Careful management of the transplant candidate by viral replication assessment and liver biopsy allows to achieve excellent kidney transplant results in these patients, also thanks to the antiviral therapies available today including pretransplant interferon for hepatitis C and nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors for hepatitis B.         Until recently, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was an absolute contraindication to solid organ transplantation. At the end of the 1990s, it became clear that HIV infection, once a fatal disease, could be effectively turned into a chronic condition by the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy. As a result, a growing number of HIV patients develop HIV-associated end-stage renal disease. For this reason we have to reconsider kidney transplant as a possible treatment option. During the last decade, the results of many studies have shown that transplantation can be safe and effective in these patients, as long as HIV infection is effectively controlled by antiretroviral therapy."
4697,0.005,1.0000,"Body composition in HIV-infected individuals is subject to many influences. We conducted a pilot 6-month randomized trial of 68 women living with AIDS (WLA) from rural India. High protein intervention combined with education and supportive care delivered by HIV-trained village women (activated social health activist [Asha] life [AL]) was compared to standard protein with usual care delivered by village community assistants (usual care [UC]). Measurements included CD4 counts, ART adherence, socio-demographics, disease characteristics (questionnaires); and anthropometry (bioimpedance analyzer). Repeated measures analysis of variance modeled associations. AL significantly gained in BMI, muscle mass, fat mass, ART adherence, and CD4 counts compared to UC, with higher weight and muscle mass gains among ART adherent (‚â•66%) participants who had healthier immunity (CD4 ‚â•450). BMI of WLA improved through high protein supplementation combined with education and supportive care. Future research is needed to determine which intervention aspect was most responsible."
5702,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection affects body composition, but their relationship has not been studied in pregnant women. We conducted a cross-sectional study among 1669 women receiving antenatal care between 22 and 35 wk of gestation in Harare, Zimbabwe. The role of HIV-1 status and viral load, malaria and elevated serum alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin (ACT, an acute phase protein) in weight, body mass index (BMI), arm circumference (AC), triceps skinfold thickness (TSF), and arm muscle (AMA) and fat (AFA) area were assessed using multiple linear regression analysis. The mean (range) age was 24.4 (14-45) y and gestational age 29 (22-35) wk. HIV infection was present in 31.5% of the women, malaria parasitemia in 0.4% and 11.4% had serum ACT >0.4 g/L. There was no difference in any anthropometric variable between HIV-infected and uninfected women. However, women with viral loads (genome equivalents/mL) between 4 and 5 and >5 log(10) had 1.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.3, 2.3] and 2.5 (95% CI: 0.1, 5.1) kg lower weights compared with uninfected women; this was explained by losses of both AFA and AMA. Malaria parasitemia was associated with 6 cm(2) (95% CI: 0.4; 11.8) or 25% lower AMA. Elevated serum ACT was a negative predictor of all anthropometric variables, i.e., levels between 0.3 and 0.4, 0.4 and 0.5 and >0.5 g/L were associated with 1, 2 and 6 kg lower mean body weights, respectively. Despite the limitations of a cross-sectional design, we conclude that arm fat and muscle areas, reflecting body fat and lean body mass, seem to be unaffected in the majority of HIV-infected pregnant women, but decline with increasing viral loads. The effects of viral load are not explained by elevated serum ACT, which is a strong independent predictor of all anthropometric variables."
5323,0.005,1.0000,"In epidemiologic studies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at higher risk of incident diabetes mellitus compared with women with similar treatment histories. We used metabolomics to determine whether a sex difference in plasma amino acids, acylcarnitines, and organic acids predictive of diabetes and impaired energy metabolism is present in HIV-infected persons on long-term ART.We enrolled 70 HIV-infected adults (43% women) on efavirenz, tenofovir, and emtricitabine (Atripla) with HIV-1 RNA <50‚Ääcopies/mL for over 2 years. Half of the HIV-infected subjects were obese, and these were matched with 30 obese HIV-negative controls. All subjects had no history of diabetes, statin use, or heavy alcohol use. Fasting insulin sensitivity was measured using homeostatic model assessment 2 (HOMA2), and adipose tissue was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to quantitate fasting plasma branched chain and aromatic amino acids predictive of incident diabetes, and C3 and C5 acylcarnitinines and organic acids indicative of impaired energy metabolism.HIV-infected women had more baseline risk factors for insulin resistance: women were older (46 vs 44 years) and had a longer ART duration (8.4 vs 5.1 years, P‚Ää<‚Ää0.05 for both) compared with men but had similar CD4+ count (median 701‚Ääcells/ŒºL), smoking and hepatic C prevalence, and body mass index (BMI) (median 30.3‚Ääkg/m). However, women had higher insulin sensitivity compared with men (P‚Ää<‚Ää0.01), and lower plasma levels of isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine (P‚Ää<‚Ää0.01 for all), and lower C3 and C5 acylcarnitines (P‚Ää<‚Ää0.01 for all), in multivariable regression models after adjusting for DEXA fat mass index, age, race, CD4+ count, smoking, and ART duration. In the obese HIV-infected subjects and HIV-negative controls, the relationship of sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status.HIV-infected women on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART had superior glucose tolerance and lower plasma metabolites associated with the development of diabetes compared with men with similar metabolic disease risk profiles. The relationship between sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status among obese subjects, suggesting the observed sex-differences may not be specific to HIV infection.

8754,0.005,1.0000,"We examined 28 children with HIV-1 infection who were not responding to existing antiviral regimens and were enrolled into clinical trials conducted at the National Cancer Institute to receive salvage therapy. In 3 of the 28 patients (10.7%), the Q151M complex amino acid substitutions were identified. The three patients had received nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) monotherapy and/or combination regimens with multiple NRTIs for 4.3-8.6 years prior to the study. Recombinant infectious clones generated by incorporating the RT-encoding region of HIV-1 isolated from patients' plasma samples were highly resistant to zidovudine, didanosine and stavudine, while they were moderately resistant to lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TDF-containing regimens reduced HIV-1 viremia in two of the three children carrying the Q151M complex. These data suggest that the Q151M could be prevalent in pediatric patients with long-term NRTI monotherapy and/or dual NRTI regimens and that HAART regimens containing TDF may be meritorious in such patients."
1832,0.005,1.0000,"To assess the prevalence of mutations associated with drug resistance in antiretroviral-naive patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, genotypic resistance testing was conducted among drug-naive HIV-1 patients attending the University Malaya Medical Center (UMMC) between July 2003 and June 2004. Reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes of plasma virions were sequenced from 100 individuals. The majority of the patients were recently diagnosed. Codons 20-255 of the RT and 1-96 of the protease gene were examined for major and minor mutations associated with antiretroviral resistance reported by the International AIDS Society- USA (IAS-USA) Drug Resistance Mutations Group. The prevalence of patients with at least one major mutation conferring drug resistance was 1%, with only one patient having a Y181C amino acid substitution in the RT gene that confers high-level resistance to nevirapine and delavirdine. Minor mutations were detected in high prevalence in the protease gene. Amino acid substitutions I13V, E35D, and M36I were associated with CRF01_AE while L63P, V77I, and I93L were associated with subtype B. Baseline prevalence of major mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs was low among antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 patients, suggesting that routine drug resistance testing may be unnecessary for all individuals newly diagnosed with HIV or all patients beginning antiretroviral therapy."

To assess its replicative and disease-inducing properties in vivo, HIV(NL-DT5R) was inoculated into pig-tailed macaques. HIV(NL-DT5R) generated plasma viremia in all five of the monkeys and elicited humoral responses against all of the HIV-1 structural proteins but did not cause CD4(+) T-lymphocyte depletion or clinical disease. Additional adaptation will be required to optimize infectivity in vivo."
126,0.005,1.0000,"Although more than one in two HIV-infected persons may develop central fat accumulation soon after commencing antiretroviral therapy, the association between antiretroviral therapy and body fat changes has not been consistent across primary epidemiological studies. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analyses to estimate the pooled effects of antiretroviral therapy on different measures of body fat, and to examine factors that potentially modify these effects. We searched for studies that compared body mass index, waist circumference, combined overweight/obesity, and central obesity between HIV-infected adults naive and exposed to antiretroviral therapy. Random-effects subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to identify potential effect-modifiers of the pooled associations. Sixty studies, comprising data on 53,199 HIV-infected participants, were eligible for the meta-analyses. Antiretroviral therapy was associated with increased body mass index (SMD: 0.17 kg/m2; 95% CI: 0.07-0.26), waist circumference (SMD: 0.20 cm; 95% CI: 0.07-0.33), overweight/obesity (borderline significance: OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.99-1.86), and abdominal obesity (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.16-1.90). In addition, antiretroviral therapy was associated with significant increases in body mass index, overweight/obesity, and central obesity among patients with CD4 counts < 350 cells/mm3, but not among patients with higher CD4 counts (Pinteraction < 0.05 for all). Overall, exposure to antiretroviral therapy was associated with increased risks of generalized and central obesity, and risks may be exacerbated by lower CD4 counts. These findings suggest that weight management and obesity prevention programs may be worth considering as part of routine HIV care."
5871,0.005,1.0000,"Tat expression is required for efficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcription. In the present study, we generated a series of 293 cell lines that contained a provirus with a tat gene deletion (Deltatat). Cell lines that contained Deltatat and stably transfected vectors containing either wild-type tat or a number of tat mutants were obtained so that the abilities of these tat genes to stimulate HIV-1 gene expression and reverse transcription could be compared. tat genes with mutations in the amino terminus did not stimulate either viral gene expression or HIV-1 reverse transcription. In contrast, tat mutants in the activation, core, and basic domains of Tat did not stimulate HIV-1 gene expression but markedly stimulated HIV-1 reverse transcription. No differences in the levels of virion genomic RNA or tRNA3Lys were seen in the HIV-1 Deltatat viruses complemented with either mutant or wild-type tat. Finally, overexpression of the Tat-associated kinases CDK7 and CDK9, which are involved in Tat activation of HIV-1 transcription, was not able to complement the reverse transcription defects associated with the lack of a functional tat gene. These results indicate that the mechanism by which tat modulates HIV-1 reverse transcription is distinct from its ability to activate HIV-1 gene expression."
4573,0.005,1.0000,"Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) used for the treatment of HIV-1 inhibit the replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which may contribute to severe mitochondrial toxicity including lipodystrophy, through the inhibition of polymerase gamma (POLG). Polymorphisms of POLG could explain the variation in mitochondrial toxicity in HIV-1-infected patients. We explored the relationship between selected polymorphisms of POLG and lipodystrophy related to NRTIs. We studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at three amino acid residues (R1142, E1143 and R1146) and the CAG repeats of POLG in a case-control study including HIV-1 treated patients with lipodystrophy (n=69) and 2 controls (without lipodystrophy) per case matched by age, race and sex (n=138). Compared with matched controls, the polymorphisms in E1143 were significantly more frequent in case patients with lipodystrophy (aOR=4.7; p=0.048), and this was associated with a significant decrease of mtDNA in PBMC. In addition, among the parameters tested, the conditional logistic regression showed that the lipodystrophy has a strong link with E1143 polymorphisms, associated with D4T treatment (aOR=9.29, p=0.002). In conclusion, patients harbouring the changes of E1143 in the catalytic site of POLG exhibit a 4-fold increased risk to develop lipodystrophy than HIV-1 treated patients who do not have changes in E1143 and this risk can increase if the patient presenting the SNP received D4T. These could be due to decreased content of mtDNA in PBMC in these patients. Therefore, the toxicity of NRTIs leading to lipodystrophy in some HIV-1 infected patients could be explained in part by the occurrence of POLG polymorphisms."
7523,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected males have poor treatment outcomes after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to HIV-infected women. Dietary factors might mediate the association between sex and disease progression. However, the gender difference in diet among HIV-infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa is largely unknown. The objective of this study was to examine differences in dietary intake among HIV-infected men and women. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of dietary questionnaire data from 2038 adults initiating ART in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to assess whether nutrient adequacy differed by sex. We dichotomized participants' nutrient intakes by whether recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) were met and estimated the relative risk (RR) of meeting RDAs in males using binomial regression models. We also estimated the mean difference in intake of foods and food groups by gender. We found poorer dietary practices among men compared to women. Males were less likely to meet the RDAs for micronutrients critical for slowing disease progression among HIV patients: niacin (RR = 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27 to 0.55), riboflavin (RR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.91), vitamin C (RR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.00), and zinc (RR = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.24). Intake of thiamine, pantothenate, vitamins B6, B12, and E did not vary by gender. Males were less likely to eat cereals (mean difference [servings per day] = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.44 to 0.001) and vegetables (mean difference = -0.47, 95% CI: -0.86 to -0.07) in their diet, but more likely to have meat (mean difference = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.21). We conclude that male HIV patients have poorer dietary practices than females, and this may contribute to faster progression of the disease in males. "
1455,0.005,1.0000,"With the advent of the combination antiretroviral therapy era (cART), the development of AIDS has been largely limited in the USA. Unfortunately, despite the development of efficacious treatments, HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) can still develop, and as many HIV-1 positive individuals age, the prevalence of HAND is likely to rise because HAND manifests in the brain with very low levels of virus. However, the mechanism producing this viral disorder is still debated. Interestingly, HIV-1 infection exposes neurons to proteins including Tat, Nef, and Vpr which can drastically alter mitochondrial properties. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been posited to be a cornerstone of the development of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we investigated mitochondria in an animal model of HAND. Using an HIV-1 transgenic rat model expressing seven of the nine HIV-1 viral proteins, mitochondrial functional and proteomic analysis were performed on a subset of mitochondria that are particularly sensitive to cellular changes, the neuronal synaptic mitochondria. Quantitative mass spectroscopic studies followed by statistical analysis revealed extensive proteome alteration in this model paralleling mitochondrial abnormalities identified in HIV-1 animal models and HIV-1-infected humans. Novel mitochondrial protein changes were discovered in the electron transport chain (ETC), the glycolytic pathways, mitochondrial trafficking proteins, and proteins involved in various energy pathways, and these findings correlated well with the function of the mitochondria as assessed by a mitochondrial coupling and flux assay. By targeting these proteins and proteins upstream in the same pathway, we may be able to limit the development of HAND."
1018,0.005,1.0000,"The role of viral co-infections and paraproteins in the development of hematological malignancies (HMs) in HIV remains unclear. Using our large database of HIV+ patients, we investigated whether co-infection and paraproteinemia increase the risk of HM. Data on demographics, hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infections, paraproteinemia, HIV characteristics, and biopsy proven malignant hematological disorders for HIV+ patients were collected over a 10-year period in a large urban hospital setting. We identified 10,293 HIV+ patients who were followed for a median duration of 53 months. Of the 10,293 patients with HIV, 229 (2.2 %) were diagnosed with a HM. Over 85¬†% of patients in both groups were tested; no significant difference in the prevalence of chronic HBV or HCV was noted between the HM positive (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ229) and HM negative (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ9992) patients. The serum protein electrophoresis test was performed for 1371 of the 10,221 patients. HM positive patients, compared to HM negative, were more likely to be tested for paraproteins (OR 3.3, 95¬†% CI 2.5-4.4) and more likely to have a discrete paraprotein band (OR 3.3, 95¬†% CI 1.2-8.9). Discrete paraproteins exclusively correlated with the development of plasma cell malignancies. Faint or oligoclonal protein bands were seen in high grade B cell lymphomas but did not show a significant correlation with HM development. Chronic hepatitis B or C infections did not correlate with the development of HM in HIV; however, viral influence on host gene transformation may have been impacted by anti-viral therapy limiting the duration of high viremic states.

5489,0.005,1.0000,"In West and West Central Africa, multiple subtypes, circulating recombinant forms (CRF), and high proportions of unique recombinant forms (URF) are documented. The predominance of recombinants strongly suggests that dual infections occur frequently. In the present study, we adapted the multi-region hybridization assay (MHA), previously developed to identify dual infections in geographic regions where few HIV-1 variants circulate, to identify HIV-1 variants and dual infections. We designed clade-specific probes in three genomic regions (gag p17, vpu, nef) to detect eight different variants that are common in this part of Africa (A, B/D, C, F, G, CRF02_AG, CRF06_cpx, CRF22_01A1). The assay was validated with 163 samples representing the corresponding HIV-1 variants. Depending on the genomic regions, the global sensitivity of the assay ranged from 86% to 94%, and the global specificity was between 85% and 96%. The assay was then applied on 156 antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from Cameroon. The MHA assay identified 79%, 85% and 90% of the strains in nef, gag and vpu regions, respectively. The subtype/CRF distribution and the proportion of inter-region recombinants obtained by the new MHA assay were in accordance with known subtype/CRF distribution in Cameroon. Moreover, the MHA assay identified 35 (22.4%) patients as dually infected, from which 20 were reactive in more than one region and/or with concordant multigenomic recombination pattern. Despite the high genetic diversity, we successfully developed an hybridization assay allowing identification of eight common HIV-1 variants circulating in West and West Central Africa. We documented high rates of dual infection in a low-risk population group, illustrating that the global evolution of HIV diversity is driven by dual infections. This assay could become a useful screening tool for the global surveillance and monitoring of inter-subtype/CRF dual infections in West and West Central Africa."
6893,0.005,1.0000,"Lamivudine is a major drug approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Emergence of drug-resistant mutants with amino acid substitutions in the YMDD motif is a well-documented problem during long-term lamivudine therapy. Here we report a novel lamivudine-resistant strain of HBV with an intact YMDD motif, which included an amino acid substitution, rtA181T, in the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of HBV polymerase. The substitution also induced a unique amino acid substitution (W172L) in the overlapping hepatitis B surface (HBs) protein. The YMDD mutant strains were not detected even by using the sensitive peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR clamping method. The detected nucleotide substitution was accompanied by the emergence of an additional nucleotide substitution that induced amino acid change (S331C) in the spacer domain. The rtA181T mutant strain displayed a threefold decrease in susceptibility to lamivudine in in vitro experiments in comparison with the wild type. In vivo analysis using human hepatocyte-chimeric mice confirmed the resistance of this mutant strain to lamivudine. We developed a method to detect this novel rtA181T mutation and a previously reported rtA181T mutation with the HBs stop codon using restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR and identified one patient with the latter pattern among 40 patients with lamivudine resistance. In conclusion, although the incidence is not high, we have to be careful regarding the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutant strains with intact YMDD motif."
2152,0.005,1.0000,"The dynamics of the spread of individual subtypes of type 1 HIV (HIV-1), circulating in the Novosibirsk region during the epidemic rise of HIV infection was under study. The epidemic of HIV-1 in Novosibirsk has a pattern similar to that in Russia as a whole. At the initial stage of epidemics multiple sources of virus determine the heterogeneity of the isolated subtypes of HIV-1. Then the parenteral route of HIV transmission, connected with the intravenous use of narcotic drugs, becomes dominant. Recently the spread of HIV-1 from the group of intravenous drug users to other groups of the population has been observed. In the circulation of HIV-1 among drug users the leading role was shown to belong to subtype A, which ensures its rapid spread and dominating role in the epidemic process. Further spread of the HIV-1 epidemic is expected to proceed in parallel to the spread of viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases and drug addiction. Thus, HIV-1, subtype A, may be assumed to be dominant in the Novosibirsk region in the nearest future."
8588,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection frequently causes chronic hepatitis and lack of virus clearance in these patients. In addition, many patients infected by HCV also present with hypergammaglobulinemia in the early stage of chronic infection. These observations raise a possible viral superantigen effect induced by HCV, because viral superantigen found in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or in replication of defective murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is associated with T-cell dysfunction and polyclonal activation of B cells. The possibility was investigated of whether HCV encodes any superantigen by analyzing the usage of T-cell receptor (TCR) from the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Two groups, one with hypergammaglobulinemia and the other without hypergammaglobulinemia, were studied for the usage of TCR beta chain by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. It was found that all genes of V beta variable chain were used in the PBL of these patients. Furthermore, there was no significant difference of the TCR expression pattern between these two groups, nor a complete deletion of a particular T-cell subset in either group. These results do not provide evidence for HCV superantigen, but indicate that the TCR usage in the patients was neither defective nor biased."
5582,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can manipulate the microRNA (miRNA) regulatory networks in infected cells to create a permissive environment for viral replication, cellular injury, disease onset, and its progression. The aim of the present study was to understand the miRNA networks and their target genes in the liver of hepatitis B patients involved in HBV replication, liver injury, and liver fibrosis. We investigated differentially expressed miRNAs by microarray in liver biopsy samples from different stages of HBV infection and liver disease (immune-tolerant [n‚Äâ=‚Äâ8], acute viral hepatitis [n‚Äâ=‚Äâ8], no fibrosis [n‚Äâ=‚Äâ16], early [F1+F2, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ19] or late [F3+F4, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ14] fibrosis, and healthy controls [n‚Äâ=‚Äâ7]). miRNA expression levels were analyzed by unsupervised principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering. Analysis of miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks identified 17 miRNAs and 18 target gene interactions with four distinct nodes, each representing a stage-specific gene regulation during disease progression. The immune-tolerant group showed elevated miR-199a-5p, miR-221-3p, and Let-7a-3p levels, which could target genes involved in innate immune response and viral replication. In the acute viral hepatitis group, miR-125b-5p and miR-3613-3p were up, whereas miR-940 was down, which might affect cell proliferation through the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway. In early fibrosis, miR-34b-3p, miR-1224-3p, and miR-1227-3p were up, while miR-499a-5p was down, which together possibly mediate chronic inflammation. In advanced fibrosis, miR-1, miR-10b-5p, miR-96-5p, miR-133b, and miR-671-5p were up, while miR-20b-5p and miR-455-3p were down, possibly allowing chronic disease progression. Interestingly, only 8 of 17 liver-specific miRNAs exhibited a similar expression pattern in patient sera."
1220,0.005,1.0000,"Occult hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a new entity that should be considered when diagnosing patients with abnormal liver functions of unknown origin. This work was carried out to evaluate T-helper 1/T-helper 2 (Th1/Th2) cytokine profiles in patients with occult HCV infection versus chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection, also to investigate any association between theses cytokines and liver histological features in both groups. Serum levels of Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IFN-gamma) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) were measured in 35 patients with occult HCV infection compared to 50 patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and 30 healthy controls. We have found that Th1 cytokines were significantly increased in patients with CHC infection than in both occult HCV infection and control groups (p less than 0.001). On the other hand, serum IL-4 levels were higher in occult HCV infection than in CHC and control groups (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, serum IL-10 levels were higher in both patient groups vs control group (pless than 0.001), with no significant difference between CHC and occult HCV groups. Finally, only serum IL-10 levels were significantly higher among patients with high activity (A2-A3) than those with low activity (A0-A1) in both CHC and occult HCV groups (p=0.038, p=0.025, respectively). Patients with occult HCV infection exhibited a distinct immunoregulatory cytokine pattern that is shifted towards the Th2 arm. "

Surveillance databases including persons reported to the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene with HIV, HBV, and HCV by 31 December 2010 and not known to be dead as of 1 January 2000, were matched with 2000-2011 vital statistics mortality data. Of 140 606 persons reported with HIV, 4% were co-infected with HBV only, 15% were co-infected with HCV only, and 1% were co-infected with HBV and HCV. In all groups, 70-80% were male. The most common race/ethnicity and HIV transmission risk groups were non-Hispanic blacks and men who have sex with men (MSM) for HIV/HBV infection, and non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and injection drug users for HIV/HCV and HIV/HBV/HCV infections. The overall age-adjusted 2000-2011 mortality was higher in co-infected than HIV mono-infected individuals. Use of population-based surveillance data provided a comprehensive characterization of HIV co-infection with HBV and HCV. Our findings emphasize the importance of targeting HIV and viral hepatitis testing and prevention efforts to populations at risk for co-infection, and of integrating HIV and viral hepatitis care and testing services."

3845,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with the successful eradication of infection. However, patients often have difficulty adhering to HCV treatment because of factors such as the psychiatric side effects of regimens and social disadvantage. Commonly, health professionals including specialist physicians, nurses, social workers and psychologists work together under a multidisciplinary model of shared-care to support patients' adherence to HCV treatment. In some HCV treatment clinics, shared-care is not always available, or only partially implemented and this has implications for patient adherence. To explore the facilitators of adherence, an interview-based study was conducted in 2012 with a purposive sample of Australian physicians and nurses (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ20). The findings reveal that when comprehensive shared-care was limited or unavailable, physicians and nurses filled in the gaps by assuming roles outside of their expertise to help patients adhere to HCV treatment. Physicians and nurses applied instrumental support strategies based on psychosocial interventions, namely patient advocacy, pragmatic problem-solving, treatment engagement and emotional support. These strategies were provided by dedicated physicians and nurses to address shortfalls in multidisciplinary shared-care. Although these interventions were reported to assist adherence, there is an increased risk of complications when physicians and nurses move beyond the bounds of their disciplinary training, for example, to assess and manage patients' psychiatric side effects or advocate on their behalf for social services. Future research should measure the effectiveness of instrumental support strategies on HCV treatment adherence, and explore the costs associated with physicians and nurses providing instrumental support in the absence of comprehensive multidisciplinary shared-care."
6264,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among injecting drug users (IDUs) is a major public health concern. It is important to know the current burden of HCV infection among IDUs for targeted public health interventions in this high risk population. We systematically reviewed the published literature on prevalence of HCV infections among IDUs between January 1989 and April 2014. Sixty studies met the inclusion criteria for the review and subsequent analysis. Among the selected studies 26,311 IDUs were assessed for HCV infection of which 16,231 were positive, giving an overall prevalence of 61.7% (95% Confidence Interval [95% CI] 61.1-62.3%). Of the selected studies, 21 were from Asia, 20 from Europe, 13 from Americas, 5 from Australia and one from Africa. Combined regional estimates of HCV prevalence among IDUs showed that Africa has the highest mean prevalence of HCV among IDUs (97.3%, 95% CI 95.5-98.4%), however, this estimate was based only on one study from Mauritius. Europe has the second highest mean prevalence (65.9%, 95% CI 64.9-66.9%) followed by Australia (56.5%, 95% CI 53.8-59.2%). Our review suggests that the prevalence of HCV among IDUs is significantly high. There are very limited data from African nations. More comprehensive understanding of HCV epidemiology among IDUs including the risk behaviours are needed for this high risk group. "

Their prevalence and distribution patterns continue to vary across geographical locations with high prevalence being detected among high risk populations. To determine the prevalence of HBV and HCV among HIV-1 infected individuals, blood samples were collected from consenting study subjects visiting comprehensive HIV clinics in Nairobi during the period between October and December 2009."

The HCV prevalence was 1.6% (95% confidence interval: 0.6-3.6) and a history of sexually transmitted infections was independently associated with this infection. HCV RNA (corresponding to genotype 1; subtypes 1a and 1b) was detected in five/seven anti-HCV-positive samples. Although the study population reported a high rate (47.3%) of sharps and needle accidents, HCV infection was not more frequent in recyclable waste collectors than in the general Brazilian population.

1737,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are major causes of acute and chronic liver disease worldwide. Chronic infection with these viruses often leads to chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis or primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Both HBV and HCV are bloodborne viruses; however, HBV is transmitted efficiently by both percutaneous and mucosal exposures, and HCV is transmitted predominantly by percutaneous exposures. Because the relative importance of various modes of transmission of these viruses differs by country, the choice of specific prevention and control strategies depends primarily on the epidemiology of infection in a particular country. Comprehensive hepatitis B prevention strategies should include (1) prevention of perinatal HBV transmission, (2) hepatitis B vaccination at critical ages to interrupt transmission and (3) prevention of nosocomial HBV transmission. The prevention of hepatitis C is problematic because a vaccine to prevent HCV infection is not expected to be developed in the foreseeable future. From a global perspective, the greatest impact on the disease burden associated with HCV infection will most likely be achieved by focusing efforts on primary prevention strategies to reduce or eliminate the risk for transmission from nosocomial exposures (e.g. blood transfusion, unsafe injection practices) and high-risk practices (e.g. injecting drug use)."
5056,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are among the most frequent viral infections in humans, and represent a major global public health problem, especially in Asia. HBV- and HCV-related chronic hepatitis is the main causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of liver that are responsible for a high rate of morbidity and mortality. The study was done to analyze the prevalence of HBV and HCV among the people of Mymensingh City, Bangladesh. This cross sectional data was collected from the blood transfusion department of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital and descriptive analysis was performed. Out of 2015 participants, 126 were HBsAg positive and 45% were found HCV positive cases. Based on the results, it concludes that similar prevalence of HBV and HCV infections were seen in Bangladesh as other Asian countries."
4291,0.005,1.0000,"This paper describes a comprehensive study of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genotype sensitivity of the transcription-mediated amplification (TMA)-based HIV-1/HCV assay, developed and manufactured by Gen-Probe Incorporated (San Diego, CA) for screening human plasma specimens in blood bank settings. The TMA HIV-1/HCV assay is a qualitative, in vitro nucleic acid testing system used for initial screening. HIV-1 and HCV discriminatory assays are used to distinguish between HIV-1 and HCV infection or co-infection. In this study, multiple unique specimens representing HCV genotypes 1-6 were tested at various dilutions. The results show that the TMA HIV-1/HCV assay and the TMA HCV discriminatory assay have similar HCV genotype sensitivity, as both assays detected all six genotypes at 100 copies/ml and nearly all replicates tested at 30 copies/ml. Similarly, numerous unique specimens representing HIV-1 group M subtypes (A-G), HIV-1 group N, and group O specimens were tested at various dilutions. The TMA HIV-1/HCV assay and the TMA HIV-1 discriminatory assay were found to have similar HIV-1 subtype sensitivity; all variants at 100 copies/ml and nearly all at 30 copies/ml were detected. These results indicate that the TMA assays meet the sensitivity requirements for blood screening in blood banks worldwide."
4611,0.005,1.0000,"In the United States, transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) from health care exposures has been considered uncommon. However, a review of outbreak information revealed 33 outbreaks in nonhospital health care settings in the past decade: 12 in outpatient clinics, 6 in hemodialysis centers, and 15 in long-term care facilities, resulting in 448 persons acquiring HBV or HCV infection. In each setting, the putative mechanism of infection was patient-to-patient transmission through failure of health care personnel to adhere to fundamental principles of infection control and aseptic technique (for example, reuse of syringes or lancing devices). Difficult to detect and investigate, these recognized outbreaks indicate a wider and growing problem as health care is increasingly provided in outpatient settings in which infection control training and oversight may be inadequate. A comprehensive approach involving better viral hepatitis surveillance and case investigation, health care provider education and training, professional oversight, licensing, and public awareness is needed to ensure that patients are always afforded basic levels of protection against viral hepatitis transmission."
9604,0.005,1.0000,"To study the prevalence, intensity, and quality of pain in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and to evaluate factors influencing the different components of pain, a self-administered multidimensional pain questionnaire (Italian Pain Questionnaire [IPQ]) was administered to 153 HIV patients admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases of a teaching hospital over a 7-month period. Ninety-three (60.8%) patients experienced pain for a total of 131 pain sites. The intensity and the nonsensorial components of pain were greater in ward patients compared to outpatients. In 70% of pain syndromes it was not possible to define the etiology at the time of the visit. Pain was observed more frequently in intravenous drug users (IDUs) (72.9%) compared to patients with other HIV modalities of transmission (50.6%) (p = 0.008). The mean value of sensory class was greater in patients who were not IDUs. Within IDUs group there was a predominance of descriptors of the affective class over the sensory class. The prevalence of pain is high in HIV-infected individuals. The different components of pain are influenced by the modality of transmission and the setting of care. The assessment of scores of different components of pain could help to select and monitor appropriate interventions in pain control."
1793,0.005,1.0000,"Hematologic manifestations in perinatally human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected children have not been widely described in literature. Knowledge of the spontaneous evolution of this disease is essential for achieving optimum care of patients. We analyzed the main hematologic manifestations developed in the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy period of 1217 children, collected from the Italian Register for HIV infection. In 111 patients, the hematologic sign was the first clinical manifestation. Among anemic and neutropenic patients, the fraction of patients in clinical class C was significantly higher than the corresponding fraction in class B (76%, P<0.001 and 74%, P<0.01), and significantly lower in thrombocytopenic patients (42%, P<0.001). The overall progression from class B to C was overlapping to the control group; when separated, however, anemic patients progressed faster (P<0.0001), whereas thrombocytopenic patients had a slower progression, similar to the nonhematologic patients in class A. Anemic patients had a worse prognosis than the control group (P<0.0001), similar to the nonhematologic patients in class C. Finally, the negative prognostic value of anemia was independent from the immunologic condition. Anemia was associated with greater mortality risks. Thrombocytopenia appeared, paradoxically, to be a positive prognostic factor within class B. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification presently defines hematologic patients as a single entity; a finer distinction could improve its relevance for the rational design of prevention and therapy."
1702,0.005,1.0000,"The efficacy of two-class versus three-class antiretroviral salvage treatment was analyzed retrospectively in 63 HIV-infected patients in whom highly active antiretroviral therapy failed. Twenty-eight patients (group A) received two-class therapy, and 35 patients (group B) received three-class therapy. After 3 months of treatment, a significantly greater proportion of patients in group B (23/35, 65.7%) than in group A (8/28, 28.5%) showed a > or = 1 log10 decrease in the plasma HIV RNA level (P = 0.0034). However, after 9-12 months, 12 of 23 (52.1%) group B responders showed viral load rebound. The results were partially explained by the finding that, at baseline, the great majority (21/27, 77.7%) of group A patients showed mutations conferring resistance to all drugs administered, whereas in group B patients' susceptibility to at least two drug classes was retained. However, after 9-12 months of therapy, most (18/20, 90%) of the short-term responders in group B showed emergence of additional mutations that hampered long-term response."
2026,0.005,1.0000,"We estimate how the effect of antiretroviral treatment depends on the time from HIV-infection to initiation of treatment, using observational data. A major challenge in making inferences from such observational data arises from biases associated with the nonrandom assignment of treatment, for example bias induced by dependence of time of initiation on disease status. To address this concern, we develop a new class of Structural Nested Mean Models (SNMMs) to estimate the impact of time of initiation of treatment after infection on an outcome measured a fixed duration after initiation, compared to the effect of not initiating treatment. This leads to a SNMM that models the effect of multiple dosages of treatment on a time-dependent outcome, in contrast to most existing SNNMs, which focus on the effect of one dosage of treatment on an outcome measured at the end of the study. Our identifying assumption is that there are no unmeasured confounders. We illustrate our methods using the observational Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP) Core01 database on HIV. The current standard of care in HIV-infected patients is Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Treatment (HAART); however, the optimal time to start HAART has not yet been identified. The new class of SNNMs allows estimation of the dependence of the effect of 1 year of HAART on the time between estimated date of infection and treatment initiation, and on patient characteristics. Results of fitting this model imply that early use of HAART substantially improves immune reconstitution in the early and acute phase of HIV-infection."
886,0.005,1.0000,"The possession of some HLA class I molecules is associated with delayed progression to AIDS. The mechanism behind this beneficial effect is unclear. We tested the idea that cytotoxic T-cell responses restricted by advantageous HLA class I molecules impose stronger selection pressures than those restricted by other HLA class I alleles. As a measure of the selection pressure imposed by HLA class I alleles, we determined the extent of HLA class I-associated epitope variation in a cohort of European human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals (n=84). We validated our findings in a second, distinct cohort of African patients (n=516). We found that key HIV epitopes restricted by advantageous HLA molecules (B27, B57, and B51 in European patients and B5703, B5801, and B8101 in African patients) were more frequently mutated in individuals bearing the restricting HLA than in those who lacked the restricting HLA class I molecule. HLA alleles associated with clinical benefit restricted certain epitopes for which the consensus peptides were frequently recognized by the immune response despite the circulating virus's being highly polymorphic. We found a significant inverse correlation between the HLA-associated hazard of disease progression and the mean HLA-associated prevalence of mutations within epitopes (P=0.028; R2=0.34). We conclude that beneficial HLA class I alleles impose strong selection at key epitopes. This is revealed by the frequent association between effective T-cell responses and circulating viral escape mutants and the rarity of these variants in patients who lack these favorable HLA class I molecules, suggesting a significant pressure to revert."
8460,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has become the standard of care for patients with HIV infection in South Africa and has led to the reduction in AIDS related morbidity and mortality. In developing countries, the nucleosides reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) class are widely used because of their low production costs. However patients treated with NRTIs develop varying degree of toxicity after long-term therapy. For this study patients are administered with a triple therapy of two NRTIs and one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)."
9649,0.005,1.0000,"Functional retroviral integrase protein is thought to be essential for productive viral replication. Yet, previous studies differed on the extent to which integrase mutant viruses expressed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genes from unintegrated DNA. Although one reason for this difference was that class II integrase mutations pleiotropically affected the viral life cycle, another reason apparently depended on the identity of the infected cell. Here, we analyzed integrase mutant viral infectivities in a variety of cell types. Single-round infectivity of class I integration-specific mutant HIV-1 ranged from <0.03 to 0.3% of that of the wild type (WT) across four different T-cell lines. Based on this approximately 10-fold influence of cell type on mutant gene expression, we examined class I and class II mutant replication kinetics in seven different cell lines and two primary cell types. Unexpectedly, some cell lines supported productive class I mutant viral replication under conditions that restricted class II mutant growth. Cells were defined as permissive, semipermissive, or nonpermissive based on their ability to support the continual passage of class I integration-defective HIV-1. Mutant infectivity in semipermissive and permissive cells as quantified by 50% tissue culture infectious doses, however, was only 0.0006 to 0.005% of that of WT. Since the frequencies of mutant DNA recombination in these lines ranged from 0.023 to <0.093% of the WT, we conclude that productive replication in the absence of integrase function most likely required the illegitimate integration of HIV-1 into host chromosomes by cellular DNA recombination enzymes."
5309,0.005,1.0000,"The importance of HLA class I-restricted CD8 T-cell responses in the control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is generally accepted. While several studies have shown an association of certain HLA class I alleles with slower disease progression, it is not fully established whether this effect is mediated by HIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses restricted by these alleles. In order to study the influence of the HLA class I alleles on the HIV-specific CD8 T-cell response and on viral control, we have assessed HIV-specific epitope recognition, plasma viral load, and expression of HLA class I alleles in a cohort of HIV-seropositive bar workers. Possession of the HLA class I alleles B5801, B8101, and B0702 was associated with a low median viral load and simultaneously with a broader median recognition of Gag epitopes compared to all other HLA alleles (twofold increase) (P = 0.0035). We further found an inverse linear relationship between the number of Gag epitopes recognized and the plasma viral load (R = -0.36; P = 0.0016). Particularly, recognition of multiple epitopes within two regions of Gag (amino acids [aa] 1 to 75 and aa 248 to 500) was associated with the maintenance of a low steady-state viremia, even years after acute infection."
6026,0.005,1.0000,"Having noted the good clinical status of some HIV patients who were referred for but refused surgery, we undertook surgery with the aim of determining outcome, risk-to-benefit ratio and, if possible, the effect of surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on the progression of their HIV disease. Antiretroviral drugs (ARVD) were not available to these patients. The records of 49 patients, 17 males and 32 females, aged between 17 and 67 years, undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass over a nine-year period, were reviewed. Forty-eight of these underwent cardiac surgery and one aortic dissection repair. Four HIV-infected patients underwent surgery with good early outcome. Thereafter an absolute CD4 cell count greater than 400/microl (normal 550*1 955/microl) and the absence of the stigmata of AIDS in patients fulfilling the normal criteria for surgery allowed cardiac surgery using CPB. Fifty operations were performed. Three patients with CD4 counts of 37, 868 and 1 245/microl died early, giving a 30-day mortality of 6% for 50 procedures. Six patients with active infective endocarditis (IE) underwent emergency surgery. Three of these, one with a pre- and two with only post-operative counts all below 250/microl, died within three months. Sixteen complications occurred in the remaining 46 patients (34.7%). Pre-operative CD4 cell counts taken in 42 patients averaged 685/microl. Pre- and post-operative counts known in eight showed variations, as did repeated counts in those awaiting surgery. Forty-one patients left hospital in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, five in class II and one in class III. Prior to surgery, the majority (38) were in class III and seven were in class IV. Follow up ranging from two to 70 months averaged 23.1 months. Eight late deaths occurred, three related to AIDS. We found surgery to be worthwhile in selected HIV-infected patients. Early outcome paralleled that in the uninfected, giving a low risk-to-benefit ratio. Emergency surgery in those with active infective endocarditis and marked immune compromise met with high mortality. It is essential in our population to test and stage all patients for HIV. We could not show that CPB accelerated progression to AIDS. This experience and the present availability of ARVDs would enable us to review our selection criteria for surgery."
2612,0.005,1.0000,"We performed this study to evaluate prevalence and clinical course of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive and anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive renal transplant recipients. HBsAg positivity was 13.7 and anti-HCV positivity 12.8%. Before transplantation, the HBsAg positivity was observed in in 83.5% of the patients, and 16.4% of the patients acquired HBsAg after renal transplantation. In the HCV group, anti-HCV positivity was observed in 47.1% before transplantation, and 19.6% acquired anti-HCV after renal transplantation. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and in the HCV groups was not different (25.7 vs. 25.5%). Among those with chronic hepatitis in the HBV group, 4 cases progressed to fulminant hepatic failure, 1 case progressed to the end-stage liver cirrhosis, and 1 case to hepatocellular carcinoma. However, in the HCV group, no case showed progression of chronic hepatitis. The overall mortality in the HBV and HCV groups was 25.3 and 7.8%, respectively (p = 0.001). Among 20 fatal cases in the HBV group 9, cases were liver disease related, but no liver disease related death occurred in the HCV group. In conclusion, HCV as well as HBV infections are quite prevalent and important causes of posttransplant chronic hepatitis, and the clinical course of anti-HCV-positive recipients is less aggressive than that of HBsAg-positive recipients."
3287,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence rates of hepatitis-B surface antigen (HGsAg) and its homologous antibody (anti-HBs) were determined in 62 patients in a leprosarium (42 tuberculoid and 20 lepromatous) and in 40 adults living near the locality. The exposure rate (HBsAg + anti-HBs) was high in both controls and patients, 72.5% and 70.9% respectively, The frequency of HBsAg was significantly higher in patients with lepromatous leprosy (40%) compared with controls (10%) (chi 2 = 5.7 p less than 0.025) but there was no difference in the prevalence rate of HBsAg between patients with lepromatous leprosy (40%) compared with those with tuberculoid leprosy (23.8%) (chi 2 = 1.7 p greater than 0.1). The exposure rate was higher in the lepromatous group (80%) compared with the tuberculoid group (59.5%) but the difference was not significant (chi 2 = 2.87 p greater than 0.05). It is concluded that the high rate of infection in patients with leprosy if not due to a peculiar genetic defect but the result of living in an environment where the virus is highly endemic. The observed significance increase in carriage of HBsAg in lepromatous leprosy is probably due to depressed cellular immune function characteristic of this group of patients. The slightly increased exposure rate to HBV of lepromatous versus the tuberculoid type of leprosy is probably due to increased opportunity for infections from repeated and prolonged stay in hospital."

In the basal sample only 2 and 8 patients in Group I were HBV-DNAp and HBV-DNA positive, respectively, and became negative during the follow-up. In contrast all patients in Group II remained positive to both HBV-markers. After a one-month follow-up 100% of the patients in Group II were positive for pHSA-R and HBeAg, in contrast to 25% among those with a favorable outcome in Group I (p less than 0.005). Meanwhile, only 6 out of 17 patients in Group III remained positive for pHSA-R. A significant decrease in pHSA-R and HBsAg concentrations was observed in patients from Group I (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.05, respectively) 15 days after the onset of the disease, while concentrations of both parameters did not vary in Group II. A significant decrease in HBsAg and pHSA-R concentrations was found in patients from Group III after 15 days (p less than 0.05) and one month follow-up (p less than 0.05), respectively. As a result, pHSA-R and HBeAg are the best prognostic indicators in acute hepatitis B. A decrease in HBsAg and pHSA-R concentrations two weeks after the onset may have predictive value."

However, there is no information about anti-HBc levels in the natural history of CHB. This study aimed to define anti-HBc levels of different phases in the natural history of CHB. Two hundred eleven treatment-naive CHB patients were included in the study. They were classified into 4 phases: immune tolerance (IT) phase (n = 39), immune clearance (IC) phase (n = 48), low or no-replicative (LR) phase (n = 55), and HBeAg-negative hepatitis (ENH, n = 69). Fifty patients who were HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive were also recruited as past HBV infection (PBI) control group. Anti-HBc levels were measured by a newly developed double-sandwich immunoassay. Correlation of anti-HBc levels with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and other HBV-related markers within each phase was performed. Serum anti-HBc levels were statistically significant between patients in different phases of CHB (P < 0.001). The median anti-HBc levels were: IT (3.17 log 10 IU/mL), IC (4.39 log 10 IU/mL), LR (3.29 log 10 IU/mL), ENH (4.12 log 10 IU/mL), and PBI (0.61 log 10 IU/mL). There existed a strong correlation in IC (r = 0.489, P < 0.001), a poor correlation in ENH (r = 0.275, P = 0.042), and no correlation in patients with ALT reached 5 times upper limit of normal (r = 0.120, P = 0.616). Anti-HBc levels show significant differences during the natural course of CHB. These results may provide some potentially useful insights into hepatitis B pathogenesis and immune activation against hepatitis B virus."

In five patients serum alpha 2-PAG levels were similar to those in the control group. On the other hand, eight (100%) chronic persistent HBV patients showed high levels of alpha 2-PAG (P less than 0.05) during the study period, and these levels correlated well with inflammatory activity and failure of HBsAg elimination. There were no significant differences in alpha 2-PAG values between asymptomatic HBsAg carriers and controls. Serial analysis of alpha 2-PAG, in correlation with viral markers, biochemical parameters, and histological data, would contribute to the ability to predict the final outcome of HBV infection."
1820,0.005,1.0000,"One key step of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the integration of its viral cDNA. This process is mediated through complex networks of host-virus interactions that alter several normal cell functions of the host. To study the complexity of disturbances in cell gene expression networks by HIV-1 integration, we constructed a network of human macrophage genes located close to chromatin regions rich in proviruses. To perform the network analysis, we selected 28 genes previously identified as the target of cDNA integration and their transcriptional profiles were obtained from GEO Profiles (NCBI). A total of 2770 interactions among the 28 genes located around the HIV-1 proviruses in human macrophages formed a highly dense main network connected to five sub-networks. The overall network was significantly enriched by genes associated with signal transduction, cellular communication and regulatory processes. To simulate the effects of HIV-1 integration in infected macrophages, five genes with the most number of interaction in the normal network were turned off by putting in zero the correspondent expression values. The HIV-1 infected network showed changes in its topology and alteration in the macrophage functions reflected in a re-programming of biosynthetic and general metabolic process. Understanding the complex virus-host interactions that occur during HIV-1 integration, may provided valuable genomic information to develop new antiviral treatments focusing on the management of some specific gene expression networks associated with viral integration. This is the first gene network which describes the human macrophages genes interactions related with HIV-1 integration."

Thirty-nine children born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers were evaluated by the three techniques. The children were then followed to at least 18 months of age. The p24 antigen was measured in plasma and HIV proviral DNA was determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after amplification by PCR. Prime pairs from three different regions of the proviral genome were used for the PCR tests. We found that in the first evaluation, 15 (100%) of the children who later developed clinical symptoms were positive by PCR analysis, 14 (93.3%) by the initial VC assay and only 8 (53.3%) by the p24 antigen assay. In conclusion, PCR and VC assays were found to have higher sensitivity than the p24 antigen assay for the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection. In addition, p24 antigenaemia was shown to be useful in predicting the onset of the disease. This study shows that the PCR test represents a more reliable and faster alternative to viral culture for the diagnosis of pediatric HIV infection."
2199,0.005,1.0000,"The study aimed to investigate the association of prevalent genotypes in China (HBV/C and HBV/B) with HBV drug-resistant mutations. A total of 13,847 nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)-treated patients with chronic HBV infection from North China were enrolled. HBV genotypes and resistant mutations were determined by direct sequencing and confirmed by clonal sequencing if necessary. HBV/B, HBV/C, and HBV/D occupied 14.3%, 84.9%, and 0.8% across the study population, respectively. NA usage had no significant difference between HBV/B- and HBV/C-infected patients. Lamivudine-resistant mutations were more frequently detected in HBV/C-infected patients, compared with HBV/B-infected patients (31.67% vs. 25.26%, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). Adefovir- and entecavir-resistant mutation detection rates were similar, but the mutational pattern was different between the two genotypes. For adefovir-resistant mutations, HBV/C-infected patients had a higher detection rate of rtA181‚ÄâV (HBV/C 5.29% vs. HBV/B 1.36%, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01) and a lower detection rate of rtN236T (2.70% vs. 6.54%, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). For entecavir-resistant mutations, HBV/C-infected patients had a higher detection rate of rtM204‚ÄâV/I+T184 substitution or S202G/C (3.66% vs. 2.16%, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01) and a lower detection rate of rtM204‚ÄâV/I+M250‚ÄâV/I/L substitution (0.67% vs. 1.46%, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). Multidrug-resistant mutations (defined as coexistence of mutation to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues) were detected in 104 patients. HBV/C-infected patients had a higher detection rate of multidrug-resistant mutation than HBV/B-infected patients (0.83% vs. 0.35%, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). The study for the first time clarified that HBV/C-infected patients had a higher risk to develop multidrug-resistant mutations, compared with HBV/B-infected patients; and HBV/C- and HBV/B-infected patients had different inclinations in the ETV-resistant mutational pattern."
8456,0.005,1.0000,"High rates of mutation and recombination help human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to evade the immune system and develop resistance to antiretroviral therapy. Macrophages and T-cells are the natural target cells of HIV-1 infection. A consensus has not been reached as to whether HIV replication results in differential recombination between primary T-cells and macrophages. Here, we used HIV with silent mutation markers along with next generation sequencing to compare the mutation and the recombination rates of HIV directly in T lymphocytes and macrophages. We observed a more than four-fold higher recombination rate of HIV in macrophages compared to T-cells (p < 0.001) and demonstrated that this difference is not due to different reliance on C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) co-receptors between T-cells and macrophages. We also found that the pattern of recombination across the HIV genome (hot and cold spots) remains constant between T-cells and macrophages despite a three-fold increase in the overall recombination rate. This indicates that the difference in rates is a general feature of HIV DNA synthesis during macrophage infection. In contrast to HIV recombination, we found that T-cells have a 30% higher mutation rate than macrophages (p < 0.001) and that the mutational profile is similar between these cell types. Unexpectedly, we found no association between mutation and recombination in macrophages, in contrast to T-cells. Our data highlights some of the fundamental difference of HIV recombination and mutation amongst these two major target cells of infection. Understanding these differences will provide invaluable insights toward HIV evolution and how the virus evades immune surveillance and anti-retroviral therapeutics. "

The results from the Sentinel Surveillance System show a seroprevalence of 1.3% HIV1 among pregnant women, 2.5% in people attending STD clinic and 3.5% in tuberculosis patients. The World Health Organization projection model was used to make a short term projection of HIV infection and AIDS cases. Results show that the number estimated of HIV infected populations varies between 24 to 45,000 people by the year 1995. Results show also an estimated 8,500 cumulative AIDS cases. Even in a low prevalence country as Cameroon the impact of the HIV epidemic is important and will result in a burden for the health care system."
8663,0.005,1.0000,"In untreated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, most viral genomes in resting CD4(+) T cells are not integrated into host chromosomes. This unintegrated virus provides an inducible latent reservoir because cellular activation permits integration, virus gene expression, and virus production. It remains controversial whether HIV-1 is stable in this preintegration state. Here, we monitored the fate of HIV-1 in resting CD4(+) cells by using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter virus carrying an X4 envelope. After virus entry into resting CD4(+) T cells, both rescuable virus gene expression, visualized with GFP, and rescuable virion production, assessed by p24 release, decayed with a half-life of 2 days. In these cells, reverse transcription goes to completion over 2 to 3 days, and 50% of the viruses that have entered undergo functional decay before reverse transcription is complete. We distinguished two distinct but closely related factors contributing to loss of rescuable virus. First, some host cells undergo virus-induced apoptosis upon viral entry, thereby reducing the amount of rescuable virus. Second, decay processes directly affecting the virus both before and after the completion of reverse transcription contribute to the loss of rescuable virus. The functional half-life of full-length, integration-competent reverse transcripts is only 1 day. We propose that rapid intracellular decay processes compete with early steps in viral replication in infected CD4(+) T cells. Decay processes dominate in resting CD4(+) T cells as a result of the slow kinetics of reverse transcription and blocks at subsequent steps. Therefore, the reservoir of unintegrated HIV-1 in recently infected resting CD4(+) T cells is highly labile."
3119,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the central nervous system (CNS) results in neuronal damage and apoptosis, and both in vitro models and pathological studies suggest that a variety of neurotoxins released by HIV-infected and -activated macrophages/microglia selectively damage susceptible subsets of neurons. Confirmation of in vitro findings of mechanisms of neurodegeneration and neuronal cell dysfunction in vivo has been approached through detailed pathological analysis of regional structural damage, immunohistochemical detection of selected antigens in damaged cells, and, more recently, analysis of gene expression in whole tissue blocks or pooled populations (hundreds/thousands) of microdissected cells. Recently developed techniques of gene expression analysis through antisense mRNA amplification (aRNA) at the single-cell level may offer the potential to study pathways of neuronal cell death and to determine patterns of coordinated gene expression that may more specifically identify susceptible neuronal subclasses in vivo. Utilizing this unique technique, the authors have demonstrated, for the first time, RNA amplification and gene expression profiling in individual deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-reactive neurons microdissected from fixed, archival human brain tissue. RNA amplification was successful in >80% of TUNEL-positive neurons, and quantitative aRNA/cDNA hybridization slot-blot analysis demonstrated similar levels of actin RNA but significant differences in caspase-2 RNA expression between TUNEL-reactive and -nonreactive neurons. Reliable quantitative comparisons were achieved with modest numbers of sampled neurons (approximately 10). These studies suggest that analysis of coordinated gene expression in individual damaged neurons in vivo can be reliably used to identify neuronal subclasses that express certain susceptibility- or survival-promoting genes that may be targeted for more specific neuroprotective strategies against HIV."
3134,0.005,1.0000,"As a result of shared modes of transmission, chronic hepatitis C infection is common in HIV-infected patients, particularly among those who have used injection drugs as well as men who have sex with men (MSMs). In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, HCV infection has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Over the last decade, treatment with peginterferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) has been recommended for coinfected patients who are at the greatest risk for liver disease; however, the effectiveness of HCV treatment in this population has been disappointing. Challenges to the use of HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, patients with HIV/HCV coinfection include the potential for interactions between different drugs, addition of drug toxicities, and the need for therapy with PEG-IFN. Despite these challenges, limited data indicate that telaprevir and boceprevir given in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV increase the rate of viral suppression in coinfected patients with manageable toxicity and drug-drug interaction profile. Accordingly, these agents may be recommended for HCV treatment in carefully selected HIV-infected persons."
7650,0.005,1.0000,"Non-A, non-B hepatitis viruses have been implicated as the etiological agent(s) in up to 60% of patients with fulminant hepatitis. These agents are reported to induce a higher mortality than other causes of fulminant hepatitis. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) at present constitute the major identifiable non-A, non-B hepatitis agents. Of these, HEV has been established as the sole cause of epidemic hepatitis in Afro-Asian countries, and fulminant hepatitis has been recorded during such epidemics. However, in sporadic cases, the etiological role of HEV in fulminant hepatitis has remained uncertain. The role of HCV in acute liver disease and fulminant hepatitis remains unclear. The present study was undertaken to investigate the association of HEV and HCV in patients with fulminant hepatitis by direct detection of the viral genome using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum samples from 50 serologically identified non-A, non-B fulminant hepatitis cases negative for cryptic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection examined via PCR were tested for HEV and HCV RNA using RT-PCR. For HEV primers from the nonstructural region (ORF-1) were used, and for HCV primers from the highly conserved 5' untranslated regions were used. The products were analysed using agarose gel electrophoresis and confirmed by hybridisation with radiolabelled internal oligonucleotide probes. HEV was detected in 31 (62%) of the 50 fulminant non-A, non-B hepatitis cases. In 18 (36%) cases, HCV RNA was detected. In 11 (22%) of the HCV cases, the HEV genome was also amplified. In 20 (40%) cases, HEV was detected alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
6247,0.005,1.0000,"The need for antiretroviral therapy coupled with treatment of chronic co-morbidities places HIV-infected patients at risk for polypharmacy. However, few studies have described overall pill burden among HIV-infected patients. HIV-infected outpatients of the UNC Infectious Diseases Clinic were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Subjects were contacted prior to a scheduled appointment and asked to bring all their medications to the visit. Daily total pill burden and medication type were recorded. 151 subjects were recruited: 76% male, 58% African American, 97% receiving antiretrovirals (ARVs). Median age was 48 (IRQ: 42-54) years. The median number of medications per subject was 8 (IQR: 6-11), and the median individual daily pill burden was 8 pills (IQR: 5-15): 3 pills (range: 2-5) for ARVs and 6 (range: 3-12.5) pills for non-ARVs. Duration of ART (per 2 years increase) and more than 3 co-morbidities was significantly associated with high pill burden (over 10 pills per day) with adjusted OR of 2.09 (95% CI, 1.14-3.84) and 8.04 (95% CI, 2.30-28.15), respectively. As patients with HIV age, strategies to reduce pill burden and number of medications will become increasingly critical to maintaining adherence, preventing medication errors, and serious drug-drug interactions."
749,0.005,1.0000,"To date, no studies have provided data on hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevalence among asymptomatic, healthy human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I) positive carriers. This sero- and molecular epidemiology study was performed on patients in the Northeast of Iran, which is an endemic area for HTLV-I infection. A total of 109 sera were collected from HTLV-I positive healthy carriers who were admitted to Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad City. All were tested for HBV serology and subsequently, real time PCR was carried out on the samples, regardless of the results of the serology. Standard PCR and direct sequencing were applied on positive samples. All cases were negative for HBsAg, Anti-HBc, and anti-HBs were positive in 34 (31.1%), and 35 (32%) individuals, respectively. There were 19 (17.4%) cases that were positive only for anti-HBs, and they had already received HBV vaccine. 16 (15%) were positive for both anti-HBs and anti-HBc, indicating a past-resolved HBV infection. 18 (16.5%) were isolated as anti-HBc, and 56 (51.3%) were negative for all HBV serological markers. Only one subject (0.9%) had detectable HBV DNA (2153‚Äâcopy/ml), and assigned as being an occult HBV infection. The low prevalence of HBsAg, despite the high percentage of anti-HBc positive cases, might be related to the suppression effect of HTLV-I on surface protein expression. The low prevalence of HBV infection among HTLV-I positive healthy carriers from an endemic region, indicates that the epidemiology of HTLV-I and HBV coinfection is related to the endemicity of HBV in that region, rather than HTLV-I endemicity."
468,0.005,1.0000,"To characterize, over time, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) virus-load change in clinically stable patients, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 RNA levels were measured in serial CSF samples and in plasma samples obtained, during periods of 20 days-6 years, from 17 HIV-infected individuals not receiving antiretroviral treatment. Longitudinal trends were analyzed by linear regression and restricted maximum-likelihood techniques. CSF HIV-1 RNA levels varied within a restricted range (+/-0.5 log(10) copies/mL) around each subject-specific mean. Although 16 of the 17 subjects had CSF slopes not significantly different from zero, slopes that were more positive were associated with lower CD4 counts. In an individual patient, a CSF virus-load change >0.5 log(10) copies/mL may be clinically significant. Furthermore, our data suggest that, if the CSF virus load reflects the size of the reservoir of infected cells in the central nervous system, this reservoir may increase in those individuals with advanced immunosuppression but is stable, over several years, in patients without AIDS."
1378,0.005,1.0000,"We have previously succeeded in infecting normal human hepatocyte primary cultures with hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, infection was subject to individual variations even in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which appeared to increase the amounts of viral DNA associated with the cells. In this study, we have defined conditions which enhance hepatitis B virus penetration into the cells, and we show that, under these conditions, infection of hepatocytes is always possible, regardless of their individual origin. We have found that addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the cultures maintained in the presence of 2% DMSO at the time of infection markedly increased the infection process and made it highly reproducible. Moreover, both the tissue and species specificity were preserved. This increased HBV infection was correlated to increased amount of internalized HBV DNA and to enhanced attachment of the virions. From these results it may be assumed that PEG could favor a better interaction between virions and cells, resulting in an activated internalization of bound viral particles. Data also show that adult human hepatocyte primary cultures, which are not equally susceptible to HBV infection, are consistently capable of viral replication when the viral genome has entered the cells. This suggests that the main limitation of the in vitro HBV infection lies in the ability of human hepatocytes to specifically bind the viral particles."
7485,0.005,1.0000,"Injection drug users (IDUs) are at risk for infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Information on time trends in prevalence of these viruses among IDUs and in behaviors influencing their transmission can help define the status of these epidemics and of public health efforts to control them. We conducted a secondary data analysis combining cross-sectional data from IDUs aged 18-30 years enrolled in four Seattle-area studies from 1994 to 2004. Participants in all four studies were tested for antibody to HIV (anti-HIV), hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), and HCV (anti-HCV), and completed behavioral risk assessments. Logistic regression was used to investigate trends in prevalence over time after controlling for sociodemographic, drug use, and sexual behavior variables. Between 1994 and 2004, anti-HBc prevalence declined from 43 to 15% (p < 0.001), anti-HCV prevalence fell from 68 to 32% (p < 0.001) and anti-HIV prevalence remained constant at 2-3%. Declines in anti-HBc and anti-HCV prevalence were observed within the individual studies, although not all these declines were statistically significant. The declines in anti-HBc and anti-HCV prevalence remained significant after control for confounding. Although we did not observe coincident declines in injection equipment sharing practices, there were increases in self-reported needle-exchange use, condom use, and hepatitis B vaccination. We conclude that there has been a substantial and sustained reduction in prevalence rates for HBV and HCV infection among young Seattle IDUs, while HIV rates have remained low and stable."
3397,0.005,1.0000,"Highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proven remarkably effective for prolonging the life of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, while most HAART agents are safe, many have the potential to cause liver toxicity. Physicians must therefore consider the possibility of drug-induced liver injury in the management of HIV-infected patients, especially those with certain risk factors such as coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), female gender, alcohol abuse, older age, or obesity. Understanding how, when, and why drug-related liver damage occurs is key to managing these patients safely and effectively. Knowledge of HAART-related liver effects will help ensure that patients receive the most benefit with the least toxicity from any given drug regimen. As more information about the mechanisms of drug related liver injury is known, clinicians will be better able to tailor therapies to suit individual situations, resulting in greater patient safety and outcomes."
9450,0.005,1.0000,"We assessed the intralaboratory reproducibility of a system for sequencing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) by using replicate subanalyses of 46 plasma samples collected from HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral-experienced patients in order to determine the relative contributions of the different procedural steps to final sequence variability. Complete sequence concordance between duplicates of each sample was 99.4%. Complete and partial mismatches occurred scattered throughout the PR-RT genome segment at >300 positions. Approximately 75% of the discordances involved mixtures, some of which appeared at key resistance sites. Most differences were the result of the first-round RT-PCR procedure. Inter-rater concordance for sequence analysis and assembly was >99.9%. There was no observed correlation between the number or frequency of mismatches and plasma viral loads. A separate longitudinal analysis of a single routine control sample sequenced 103 times over 9 months consistently gave highly reproducible sequences (median percentage of nucleotide discordances, 0.04%; range, 0 to 0.2%). Finally, sequence data from 168 sequential samples collected from 22 patients with long-term, predominantly wild type HIV showed that intrapatient nucleotide concordance with individual index sequences ranged from 96.5 to 100%. Together, these results confirm that sequence-based genotyping can be a precise and reliable tool for monitoring HIV drug resistance, and they suggest that efforts to reduce variability should focus on the first RT-PCR step. Consequently, the data suggest that the composition of external quality assessment panels should be based on clinical HIV isolates rather than DNA clones."

Genotypic resistance testing was conducted among HIV-1 infected children who experienced virological failure with antiretroviral therapy (ART) using NNRTI-based regimens. Patterns of resistance mutations were studied and options for a second regimen were determined. There were 21 patients with a median (IQR) age of 4.1 (1.9-7.7) years. Sixteen patients were males. The median CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA at the time of virological failure were 647 cells/mm3 and 5.3 log copies/ml, respectively. The prevalences of patients with > or =1 major mutation conferring resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs were 52% and 43%, respectively. Thymidine analoque mutations, M184V/I, and Q151M were observed in 38%, 33%, and 5%. The patterns of resistance mutations suggest that 48% of patients need a protease inhibitor-based regimen for the second regimen and didanosine+lamivudine is the most required nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone."
231,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatologists are frequently asked to evaluate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with abnormal liver enzymes and to assess the causal role of medications, such as antiretroviral drugs. Recently, the use of HIV-1 specific non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV), has been associated with severe hepatic injury. We prospectively studied the incidence of severe hepatotoxicity (grade 3 or 4 change in alanine or aspartate transaminase levels) among 568 patients receiving NNRTI-containing antiretroviral therapy, including 312 and 256 patients prescribed EFV and NVP, respectively. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) were detected in 43% and 7.7% of patients, respectively. Severe hepatotoxicity was observed in 15.6% of patients prescribed NVP and 8.0% of those prescribed EFV, but only 32% of NVP and 50% of EFV-associated episodes were detected during the first 12-weeks of therapy. The risk was significantly greater among persons with chronic viral hepatitis (69% of cases) and those prescribed concurrent protease inhibitors (PIs) (82% of cases). Nonetheless, 84% of patients with chronic HCV or HBV did not experience severe hepatotoxicity. Severe hepatotoxicity occurs throughout the course of NNRTI therapy and is more common among patients prescribed nevirapine, those coinfected with HCV or HBV, and those coadministered protease inhibitors."

Patients were stratified by ART drug [ATV/rtv, lopinavir (LPV/rtv), efavirenz (EFV), nevirapine (NVP), and other PIs], HCV genotype (1/4 and 2/3), and IL28B genotype (CC and non-CC). The Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-squared test were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Multivariate analysis consisted of a stepwise linear regression analysis. Six hundred and forty-nine HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were included. HCV genotype 1/4 patients who received ATV had higher HCV RNA levels [6.57 (5.9-6.8) log IU/ml] than those who received LPV [6.1 (5.5-6.5) log IU/ml], EFV [6.1 (5.6-6.4) log IU/ml], NVP [5.8 (5.5-5.9) log IU/ml], or other PIs [6.1 (5.7-6.4) log IU/ml] (p=0.014). This association held for the IL28B genotype (CC versus non-CC). The association was not found in patients carrying HCV genotypes 2/3. The linear regression model identified the IL28B genotype and ATV use as independent factors associated with HCV RNA levels. ATV-based therapy may be associated with a higher HCV RNA viral load in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients."

HIV-1 phylogenetic diversity and ARV resistance mutations associated with protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) were assessed among 48 ARV-experienced patients from Goiania/Goias, central west Brazil. The gp41 resistance mutations to the fusion inhibitor (T-20) were analyzed among multidrug-resistant (MDR) patients. PR, partial RT, and gp41 genes were amplified and sequenced from plasma RNA. HIV-1 subtype was assigned by phylogenetic analysis. ARV mutations in PR/RT were analyzed by the Stanford Database. T-20 resistance mutations in gp41 were identified by Stanford, the Los Alamos Database, and other sources. Subtype B represented 79.2% (38/48), subtype F1 4.2% (2/48), subtype C 2.1% (1/48), F1(PR)/B(RT) 8.3% (4/48), and B(PR)/F1(RT) 6.3% (3/48). Secondary drug resistance was observed in 79% (38/48): NRTI resistance (n = 1), NNRTI resistance (n = 1), PI + NRTI or NRTI + NNRTI resistance (n = 20), and PI + NRTI +NNRTI resistance, considered MDR (n = 16). Almost half of the MDR patients had viral loads below 10,000 copies/ml. The gp41 sequences from 14 MDR revealed one F1(PR)/B(RT)/F1(ENV) recombinant and 13 subtype B(PR)/B(RT)/B(ENV) isolates. G36E, N42T, and N43S T-20 resistance mutations were observed in three MDR patients, two of them previously treated with T-20 and the other who had never used T-20. Our data among ARV-experienced patients showed a high proportion of drug-resistance mutations and MDR.

666,0.005,1.0000,"El Salvador harbours one of the largest Central American human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics, but few studies have analysed it in depth. Here, we describe the presence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and HIV variants in the HIV-infected adult population in El Salvador. Dried blood spots from 119 HIV-infected antiretroviral-naive adults attended in El Salvador were collected in 2011. The TDR was assessed according to the list recommended by the WHO. HIV-1 variants were described using phylogeny. Pol sequences could be amplified in 88 patients (50.6% men), with a mean age of 35 years. Almost all (96.7%) were infected with HIV through sexual practice and 58.7% were recently diagnosed. The mean CD4(+) count was 474 cells/mm(3) and 43.1% and 15.5% of patients showed moderate (<500 CD4 cells) or severe (<200) immune suppression, respectively. HIV-1 viral load was >100 000 copies/mL in 24.7% of patients and <2000 copies/mL in 9.1%. Five samples (5.7%) harboured any TDR mutation: 2.3% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), and 1.4% for protease inhibitor (PI). All showed only one TDR single-class resistance mutation: M184I (two cases) for NRTI, K101E and K103N for NNRTI and L23I for PI. All viruses excepting one (URF_BG) belonged to subtype B. No phylogenetic TDR networks were found. In conclusion, we report a TDR prevalence of 5.7% in El Salvador, lower than in other Central American studies. Periodical studies are essential to monitor and prevent TDR emergence in low-income and middle-income regions. Also, more efforts are needed to promote early diagnosis and prevention of infection in El Salvador."

Currently there is interest in the midterm outcomes of HCV patients with concomitant hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among OLT recipients. We therefore retrospectively analyzed our database of patients who underwent OLT for HCV-HBV-related cirrhosis. Between April 1992 and December 2008, 350 patients underwent OLT, including 20 (5.7%) transplanted for HBV-HCV cirrhosis. We assessed patient and graft survivals at 1 and 5 years, as well as the progression of fibrosis. Protocol liver biopsies were available yearly after OLT. The survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier approach and chronic hepatitis evaluated according to the Ishak scoring system. At a median follow-up of 68.4 +/- 53 months, the 1- and 5-year patient and graft survival rates were 80% and 70%, respectively. The 5-year fibrosis progression rate was 0.17 +/- 0.08 units of fibrosis. The only patient who developed histologic cirrhosis within 10 years of follow-up showed a lamivudine-resistant HBV recurrence. Patients transplanted for HBV-HCV coinfection showed a lower fibrosis progression rate compared with HCV monoinfected subjects."

SNP at CTLA-4 +49 was also suggested to be associated with the individual difference in the clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, their influence on the incidence of post-LT HBV reinfection was not clear. With the increasing knowledge of costimulatory mechanisms on LT and host immune response, we designed this study to investigate the relationship between different alleles as well as genotypes at these two locations and HBV reinfection after LT."
6653,0.005,1.0000,"In South Africa, where it is estimated that more people have HIV than anywhere else in the world, HIV/AIDS and psychological disorder co-morbidity have been shown both to exacerbate the late diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and to affect adherence to ARVs. Targeted, affordable and evidence-based strategies to reach these populations are essential. Against this backdrop, a pilot project and situational assessment aimed at determining the context of psychological care and HIV treatment services in South Africa was undertaken. The situational analysis consisted of individual interviews, a patient survey, and a retrospective medical record data review. Training and mentorship were conducted from 2011 to 2013 by the Foundation for Professional Development (FPD) in five anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinics in the Tshwane-Metsweding area. Data were both descriptively and inferentially analysed. Outcomes indicate that the general structure of HIV services is well organised and well run in the sampled clinics. However, mental healthcare and HIV services need to be integrated further. There is also a need to develop and pilot-test appropriate materials and models for the delivery of mental healthcare within the parameters of affordability, acceptability and availability further, and to advocate the advancement of mental health and HIV treatment and policy integration."
2926,0.005,1.0000,"Several noninvasive blood biomarkers have been established for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but their clinical performance remains inconclusive. Here, we compared the diagnostic performance of these biomarkers and developed a novel algorithm for assessing liver fibrosis. Six hundred and sixteen chronically HBV-infected and treatment-na√Øve patients who underwent liver biopsy were enrolled and randomly divided into training (N=410) and internal validation cohorts (N=206). One hundred and fifty-nine patients from another centre were recruited as an external validation cohort. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyse the performance of the gamma-glutamyltransferase-to-platelet ratio (GPR), red cell volume distribution width-to-platelet ratio (RPR), FIB-4 index, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and HBV DNA level against liver histology, and a novel algorithm was developed using the recursive partitioning and regression tree (RPART) method. In the training cohort, the area under the ROC curve of FIB-4 was significantly higher than that of APRI (P=.038) but was comparable to those of GPR, RPR and HBV DNA; however, the performance of the biomarkers was similar among the validation cohort. The established RPR-HBV DNA algorithm performed better in the training cohort than any individual blood biomarker, and the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 63%, 90%, 72% and 80%, respectively. In the internal and external validation cohorts, the performance of the algorithm in assessing liver fibrosis was also superior to that of other biomarkers. These results suggest that the established RPR-HBV DNA algorithm might improve the diagnostic accuracy of liver fibrosis in treatment-na√Øve patients with chronic HBV infection, although additional studies are warranted to confirm these findings."

3338,0.005,1.0000,"We assessed the factors that influenced improvement or progression in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who were receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). This was a retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected patients receiving cART in Taizhou, Zhejiang, China, 2009-2015. Liver fibrosis was assessed by Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score. Improvement of liver fibrosis was defined as having > 30% decrease in FIB-4 from baseline, whereas progression of liver fibrosis was defined as having > 30% increase in FIB-4 score from baseline. A total of 955 HIV-infected patients were included. Of these, 808 (84.6%) were HIV-monoinfection, 125 (13.1%) were HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection and 29 (3.0%) were HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. The median duration of treatment was 15 months. After treatment, 37.1% participants had > 30% decreases in FIB-4 index, 14.8% had > 30% increases in FIB-4 index, while the remaining 48.2% had stabilized FIB-4 index. In multivariate analysis, improvement of liver fibrosis was negatively associated with an older age, but was positively associated with baseline FIB-4 index and > 30% increases in CD4 cell count after ART. Progression of liver fibrosis was positively associated with an older age, but was negatively associated with gender and HIV transmission mode (male homosexual vs. male heterosexual, female heterosexual vs. male heterosexual), and baseline FIB-4 index. Our findings indicate that improvement of liver fibrosis could be achieved by early initiation of ART through better CD4 cell recovery. Liver fibrosis and hepatotoxicity associated with ART should be monitored as early as possible and throughout till the end of treatment, with special attention to the elderly and heterosexual men."
1555,0.005,1.0000,"Drug resistance mutations in the Pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) are one of the critical factors associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure in HIV-1 patients. The issue of resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) in HIV infection has not been adequately addressed in the Indian subcontinent. We compared HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) gene sequences to identify mutations present in HIV-1 patients who were ART non-responders, ART responders and drug naive. Genotypic drug resistance testing was performed by sequencing a 655-bp region of the RT gene from 102 HIV-1 patients, consisting of 30 ART-non-responding, 35 ART-responding and 37 drug-naive patients. The Stanford HIV Resistance Database (HIVDBv 6.2), IAS-USA mutation list, ANRS_09/2012 algorithm, and Rega v8.02 algorithm were used to interpret the pattern of drug resistance. The majority of the sequences (96 %) belonged to subtype C, and a few of them (3.9 %) to subtype A1. The frequency of drug resistance mutations observed in ART-non-responding, ART-responding and drug-naive patients was 40.1 %, 10.7 % and 20.58 %, respectively. It was observed that in non-responders, multiple mutations were present in the same patient, while in responders, a single mutation was found. Some of the drug-naive patients had more than one mutation. Thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs), however, were found in non-responders and naive patients but not in responders. Although drug resistance mutations were widely distributed among ART non-responders, the presence of resistance mutations in the viruses of drug-naive patients poses a big concern in the absence of a genotyping resistance test."

In addition we assessed the prevalence of non-B subtypes based on phylogenetic analysis of the pol gene. Plasma samples from 104 newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive patients were obtained in the year 2000. The entire protease gene and 320 amino acids of the reverse transcriptase gene were genotyped. Sequences were obtained from 97 patients. No subjects displayed primary resistance mutations in the protease gene, whereas all carried 1 or more secondary mutations. Resistance mutations in the RT-gene associated with NRTI-resistance were found in 1 patient, who was infected with zidovudine resistant HIV-1 harbouring the M41L mutation in combination with T215S and L210S. The T215S mutation has been showed to be associated with reversion of zidovudine resistance. The T215S mutation was found in 1 additional patient. The subtype distribution was subtype B 59%, C 18%, A 8%, CRF02_AG 5%, CRF01_AE 4%, D 3% and G 2%. We found 2 patients (2%) with mutations associated with resistance in the RT-gene and none in the protease gene indicating a low prevalence of resistant HIV-1 in Denmark in the year 2000."

307,0.005,1.0000,"In this observational single-center cohort study outside the clinical trial setting, outcome and predictors of virologic failure of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) containing a protease inhibitor were evaluated in human immunodeficiency (HIV)-infected persons. The study population consisted of 807 protease inhibitor-naive HIV-seropositive patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy with reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors (indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir) between January 1997 and January 1999. Demographic variable, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+ T-cell count, adverse drug reactions, and adherence to HAART were assessed. Virologic treatment response was defined as a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA load from baseline to below 500 copies per milliliter after 12 months of therapy. Levels of HIV-1 RNA were undetectable in 43% of patients at 12 months. Factors associated with failure to suppress viral load included age 40 years or younger, baseline CD4+ T cell count less than 200 x 10(6) per liter baseline viral load greater than 4.3 log(10) per milliliter, and non-adherence to HAART. After adjustment by logistic regression, non-adherence was the only statistically significant variable associated with virologic failure (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.67). Unselected patients in whom protease inhibitor is started in a usual clinical setting achieve viral suppression less frequently than do patients in controlled clinical trials. Failure to adherence to HAART was the strongest predictor of virologic failure."
1215,0.005,1.0000,"We analyzed the first 96 patients tested for HIV resistance to antiretroviral therapy in three Brazilian states. The HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) were sequenced by using the ABI ViroSeq system. The drugs previously used for each patient were recorded and correlated with the mutations found in the samples. Viral load (VL) and CD4 count were also recorded. Only one patient had the wild type sequence. The most prevalent mutations were: 184V (59%), 41L (47.9%), 63P (53%), 215Y (50%), 36I (46%), 10I (35%), 67N (42%), 77I (37%), 90M (36%) and 210W (33%). A positive correlation between the number of previously used ARVs and the number of mutations was observed (p<0.05). Associations between mutations and ARV drugs were identified at positions 69, 118, 184 and 215 with previous exposure to NRTI, mutations at positions 98, 100, 103, 181 and 190 with previous NNRTI use and at positions 10, 20, 30, 46, 53, 54, 71, 73, 82, 84, 88 and 90 with previous PI therapy (p<0.05). Previous exposure to ARV drugs was associated with previous genotypic resistance to specific drugs, leading to treatment failure in HIV patients. Genotypic resistance was clearly associated with virological and immunological failure."
408,0.005,1.0000,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a slow, progressive, degenerative disease of the human immune system, ultimately leading to premature death of the patient. This disease is primarily caused by human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). The major targets of HIV infection are blood cells, namely lymphocytes and macrophages. While the immune response fails to eliminate the infected cells, the virus continues to spread. The purpose of HIV gene therapy is to provide ""anti-HIV"" genes to cells that are susceptible to HIV infection. Anti-HIV genes may be designed to express RNAs or proteins that interfere with the function of viral or cellular RNA(s)/protein(s), thereby inhibiting virus replication. Whereas interfering proteins may be cytotoxic and/or immunogenic, interfering RNAs are not. Interfering protein-based strategies requiring inducible gene expression (under the control of HIV regulatory proteins) can only be designed to block steps subsequent to the viral regulatory protein production. In contrast, interfering RNAs can be produced in a constitutive manner, which further enhances their antiviral activity and allows one to design strategies to inhibit virus replication before viral regulatory protein production occurs. Thus, interfering RNAs are of particular interest and are the focus of this review. Genes expressing interfering RNAs were designed to inhibit syncytium formation to prevent the death of the gene-modified cells. Strategies may also be developed to prevent gene-modified cells from becoming infected by HIV or from supporting HIV replication. Genes expressing interfering RNAs have been designed to inhibit HIV-1 entry and to cleave the incoming virion RNA, thus blocking virus replication before provirus DNA synthesis can be completed. A number of genes were also designed to express interfering RNAs that inhibit HIV replication at a post-integration step, by inhibiting the function of HIV RNAs or proteins produced in the infected cell. Also in development are anti-HIV genes that produce RNAs that would not only inhibit HIV replication in the gene-modified cell, but also prevent HIV RNA packaging and/or reverse transcription such that the progeny virus produced would be non-infectious. Further refinements to these strategies may lead to the development of ""self-propagating"" anti-HIV genes. These genes would express interfering RNAs that not only inhibit virus replication in the cell and prevent HIV RNA packaging and/or reverse transcription in the progeny virus, but also make use of the HIV itself to deliver the anti-HIV gene(s) to other cells. Thus, more and more cells susceptible to HIV infection would become resistant. Such ""self-propagation"" of anti-HIV-1 genes would only occur in cells that are susceptible to HIV infection, and would continue to take place for as long as HIV exists in the body."
1573,0.005,1.0000,"We present the case of a 54-year-old man who developed progressive outer retinal necrosis (PORN) as an initial manifestation of HIV infection without any significant risk factors for infection with HIV. PORN is usually found as a manifestation of known AIDS late in the disease. Our patient presented with transient visual loss followed by decrease in visual acuity and facial rash. Subsequent investigation revealed anterior chamber tap positive for varicella zoster virus (VZV), as well as HIV positivity, with an initial CD4 count of 48 cells/¬µL. Systemic and intravitreal antivirals against VZV, and highly active antiretroviral therapy against HIV were started, which halted further progression of retinal necrosis. This case highlights the importance of suspecting PORN where there is a rapidly progressive retinitis, and also testing the patient for HIV, so appropriate treatment can be started. "
8083,0.005,1.0000,"Tonus was a pilot study in which previously untreated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients received the combination of abacavir, lamivudine, and tenofovir once a day. There was a high rate of early virological failure, and the M184V and K65R mutations were frequently detected at week 12 (W12). The objective of this study was to examine the selection dynamics of the K65R and M184V/I mutations. Bulk sequencing of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene was performed on plasma HIV-1 RNA at baseline, W4, and W12 for 21 patients with detectable viral loads. The RT genes from baseline, W4, and W12 plasma samples from five patients who developed both M184V and K65R but with different mutational patterns were also cloned and screened for the K65R mutation by selective real-time PCR. At baseline, bulk sequencing and clonal analysis showed only wild-type RT sequences. At W4, M184V/I was detected in 12/19 patients and K65K/R in 2 patients by bulk sequencing. At W12, M184V/I was found in 18/20 patient, together with the K65R in 13 patients. At W4, clonal analysis revealed the K65R mutation in 0.6 to 48% of clones in the five patients studied. At W12, the K65R mutation was found in 30 to 100% of clones. K65R and M184V/I seemed to arise in separate clones, followed by an enrichment of viruses containing both mutations. The clinical relevance of this independent evolution is unclear. M184V/I was selected more frequently than K65R at W4. However, K65R was also detected early using a clone-sensitive genotyping method. All three nucleoside analogs are known to select the K65R and/or M184V/I mutation. This convergent genetic pathway to resistance, associated with lower antiretroviral potency, may explain the high selection rate of these mutations in this trial."

Hence, genetic intervention strategies based on trans-dominant (td) variants of the HIV-1 PR might be an alternative to current pharmacological and gene therapy regimens for AIDS. CD4-positive human CEM-SS T-cell lines were generated which constitutively expressed HIV-1 td PR variants. HIV-1 infection experiments demonstrated severely reduced HIV-1 replication in these td PR CEM-SS cell lines compared with control T cells expressing wild-type PR. Furthermore, replication of an HIV-1 isolate bearing a PR inhibitor-resistant PR was blocked, showing that genetic intervention strategies based on td PRs can be effective against HIV-1 isolates containing PR inhibitor-resistant mutants."
7198,0.005,1.0000,"The protease (PR) from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is essential for viral replication: this aspartyl protease, active only as a dimer, is responsible for cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors (Gag and Gag-Pol), to release the functional mature proteins. In this work, we have studied the structure-function relationships of the HIV PR by combining a genetic test to detect proteolytic activity in Escherichia coli and a bacterial two-hybrid assay to analyze PR dimerization. We showed that a drug-resistant PR variant isolated from a patient receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy is impaired in its dimerization capability and, as a consequence, is proteolytically inactive. We further showed that the polypeptide regions adjacent to the PR coding sequence in the Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor, and in particular, the transframe polypeptide (TF), located at the N terminus of PR, can facilitate the dimerization of this variant PR and restore its enzymatic activity. We propose that the TF protein could help to compensate for folding and/or dimerization defects in PR arising from certain mutations within the PR coding sequence and might therefore function to buffer genetic variations in PR."

Recombinant SIV and HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus, type 1) proteases were purified from bacterial cell lysates by use of sequential steps of ammonium sulfate precipitation and size-exclusion and ion-exchange chromatography. The amino acid composition, amino-terminal sequence, and molecular weight (monomer) of the recombinant SIV-PR were in accord with that of the 99 amino acid polypeptide predicted from the SIVMac-PR nucleotide sequence. The active form of SIV-PR was shown to be dimeric by gel filtration chromatography. Inhibition by pepstatin A, time-dependent inactivation by 1,2-epoxy-3-(4-nitrophenoxy)propane, and pH rate profiles using oligopeptide substrates demonstrated that SIV-PR behaves as an aspartic protease. Recombinant HIV-1 Pr55gag precursor was processed in vitro by SIV-PR and HIV-1 PR with indistinguishable proteolytic patterns upon NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Oligopeptide substrates for HIV-1 PR were found to be suitable substrates for recombinant SIV-PR with the exception of a peptide containing the site identified for p66/p51 cleavage (Phe*Tyr) within HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Several synthetic peptide analogue inhibitors of HIV-1 PR were also potent inhibitors of SIV-PR, indicating that SIV infection in macaques and rhesus monkeys should be useful models for the preclinical evaluation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) therapeutics targeted towards the virally encoded HIV-1 protease."

Of the 110 strains, 85 were classified into six HIV-1 PR subtypes, A (n = 1), B (n = 1), F (n = 4), G (n = 7), H (n = 1), and J (n = 7), and a circulating recombinant form, CRF02-AG (n = 64). PR genes from the remaining 25 (23%) specimens were unclassifiable, whereas 2% (7 of 301) unclassifiable PR sequences were reported for a global collection. Two major PI resistance-associated mutations, 20M and 24I, were detected in strains from only two specimens, whereas secondary mutations were found in strains from all samples except one strain of subtype B and two strains of CRF02-AG. The secondary mutations showed the typical PI resistance-associated pattern for non-subtype B viruses in both classifiable and unclassifiable PR genes, with 36I being the predominant (99%) mutation, followed by 63P (18%), 20R (15%), 77I (13%), and 10I or 10V (11%). Of these mutations, dual and triple PI resistance-associated substitutions were found in 38% of all the Cameroonian strains. Compared with classifiable PR sequences, unclassifiable sequences had significantly more dual and triple substitutions (64% versus 30%; P = 0.004). Phenotypic and clinical evaluations are needed to estimate whether PI resistance during antiretroviral drug treatment occurs more rapidly in individuals infected with HIV-1 strains harboring multiple PI resistance-associated substitutions. This information may be important for determination of appropriate drug therapies for HIV-1-infected persons in Cameroon, where more than one-third of HIV-1 strains were found to carry dual and triple minor PI resistance-associated mutations."

This report describes the development and validation of a novel assay that offers a uniform method to measure susceptibility to all clinically approved HIV type 1 (HIV-1) drugs targeting reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR), integrase (IN), and viral entry. It is an assay in which the antiviral effect on infection within a single replication cycle is measured in triply transfected U87.CD4.CXCR4.CCR5 cells, based on homologous recombination between patient-derived amplicons and molecular proviral clones tagged with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene and from which certain viral genomic regions are removed. The deletions stretch from p17 codon 7 to PR codon 98 in pNL4.3-DeltagagPR-EGFP, from PR codons 1 to 99 in pNL4.3-DeltaPR-EGFP, from RT codons 1 to 560 in pNL4.3-DeltaRT-EGFP, from IN codons 1 to 288 in pNL4.3-DeltaIN-EGFP, and from gp120 codon 34 to gp41 codon 237 in pNL4.3-Deltaenv-EGFP. The optimized experimental conditions enable the investigation of patient samples regardless of viral subtype or coreceptor use. The extraction and amplification success rate for a set of clinical samples belonging to a broad range of HIV-1 group M genetic forms (A-J, CRF01-03, CRF05, and CRF12-13) and displaying a viral load range of 200 to >500,000 RNA copies/ml was 97%.

6100,0.005,1.0000,"It has been hypothesized that naturally occurring mutations in HBV may play a role in the pathogenesis of HBV-related disease. We determined the molecular characteristics of naturally occurring HBV isolates and performed a functional analysis of full-length hepatitis B virus quasispecies from a patient with chronic hepatitis B. The 10 HBV clones isolated were identified as HBV genotype B4 and subtype adw. In most clones, amino acid substitutions and nucleotide changes occurred in a specific region of the core protein, X protein and in the core promoter. In the core protein, cI3L, cL60M, and cI97L were detected in 8 of 10 clones and cP130T was detected in all 10 clones. In the X protein, xI127M was detected in 5 clones. In the basal core promoter, the A1762T/G1764A mutation was found only in 1 clone. An 11-bp nucleotide insertion between nucleotides 1772 and 1773, was found in 2 clones. Six clones that were replication-competent exhibited variation in the level of replicating capacity in vitro even though the average genetic distance between the HBV clones was only 0.5% (range: 0.3-0.7%). Among the replication-competent 6 clones, 5 clones showed higher replication competency compared with clone B9 (reference clone used in this study) in Huh7 cells. However, 4 clones showed lower replication competency compared with clone B9 in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the HBV virus exhibits genetic variation in the form of quasispecies with different mutation patterns, and these quasispecies may be recognized by distinct viral replication patterns even in patients with subtle genetic mutation."

Here, we describe a system to assess HIV-1 resistance to all drugs targeting the three viral enzymes as well as viral assembly using a single patient-derived, chimeric virus. Patient-derived p2-INT (gag-p2/NCp7/p1/p6/pol-PR/RT/IN) products were PCR amplified as a single fragment (3,428 bp) or two overlapping fragments (1,657 bp and 2,002 bp) and then recombined into a vector containing a near-full-length HIV-1 genome with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae uracil biosynthesis gene (URA3) replacing the 3,428 bp p2-INT segment (Dudley et al., Biotechniques 46:458-467, 2009). P2-INT-recombinant viruses were employed in drug susceptibility assays to test the activity of protease (PI), nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase (NRTI), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI), and integrase strand-transfer (INSTI) inhibitors. Using a single standardized test (ViralARTS HIV), this new technology permits the rapid and automated quantification of phenotypic resistance for all known and candidate antiretroviral drugs targeting all viral enzymes (PR, RT, including polymerase and RNase H activities, and IN), some of the current and potential assembly inhibitors, and any drug targeting Pol or Gag precursor cleavage sites (relevant for PI and maturation inhibitors) This novel assay may be instrumental (i) in the development and clinical assessment of novel ARV drugs and (ii) to monitor patients failing prior complex treatment regimens."

The Langerin protein, found at the surface of Langerhans cells, has an important protective role in HIV-1 infection. Differences in Langerin function due to host genetic factors could influence susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. To verify the frequency of mutations in the Langerin gene, 118 samples from HIV-1-infected women and 99 samples from HIV-1-uninfected individuals were selected for sequencing of the promoter and carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD)-encoding regions of the Langerin gene. Langerin promoter analysis revealed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one mutation in both studied groups, which created new binding sites for certain transcription factors, such as NFAT5, HOXB9.01 and STAT6.01, according to MatInspector software analysis. Three SNPs were observed in the CRD-encoding region in HIV-1-infected and uninfected individuals: p.K313I, c.941C>T and c.983C>T. This study shows that mutations in the Langerin gene are present in the analysed populations at different genotypic and allelic frequencies. Further studies should be conducted to verify the role of these mutations in HIV-1 susceptibility. "

Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed in order to detect factors associated with response to vaccination. 437 patients were assessed for hepatitis B, 627 patients for hepatitis A and 66 patients for S. pneumoniae serologic vaccine responsiveness.

5317,0.005,1.0000,"The natural course of human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) infection varies considerably. The identification of laboratory disease markers has become critically important to patient management. This study, carried out on 37 patients with primary HIV-1 infection (PHI), shows that, along with plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ T cell counts, evaluation of plasma levels of some immune activation markers (sCD30, TNF-alpha, and sTNFR-I) may help to identify patients at risk of a more rapid disease progression, suggesting that immune activation is among the factors who determine the rate of disease progression. Early combination antiviral therapy significantly decreased levels of virus load and of immune activation markers, suggesting that it may reduce the extent of immune activation through the suppression of HIV-1 replication. Among others, sCD30 could be a more sensitive marker of immune activation, and it might be also useful in the monitoring of the response to antiviral therapy."

Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the impact of transmission category on time to HAART initiation, viral suppression (defined by first HIV-1 RNA viral load measurement <500 copies/ml after HAART), and survival from AIDS. Of 4643 patients, 73% were men and 56% were injecting drug users (IDUs). A statistically significant interaction was found between transmission category and previous non-HAART antiretroviral treatment (ART) (p < 0.05). Among ART naive patients, IDUs had a 33% lower risk of initiating HAART compared to men who have sex with men (MSM) [HR 0.67 (95% CI 0.57-0.79)]. No differences by transmission categories were seen among patients with prior non-HAART ART. IDUs had poorer viral load (VL) suppression than MSM [HR 0.86 (95% CI 0.74-0.99)] adjusting by baseline VL, AIDS diagnosis, and prior ART. Mortality from AIDS was two and a half times higher in IDUs than MSM [HR 2.51 (95% CI 1.03-6.1)]. Among patients who access the hospital network, IDUs have a lower uptake of HAART, have worse virological suppression, and have higher mortality after AIDS diagnosis. There is a need to extend the programs in order to enhance access and adherence of IDUs to HAART and consider the treatment of drug addiction as an integral part of the treatment for HIV infection."
8653,0.005,1.0000,"The evaluation of new cases of HIV infection is relatively common in Spain, where several thousands of patients with new infections are diagnosed each year. Eighty per cent of them have a chronic HIV infection at the first clinical evaluation, which is symptomatic (late presenters) in up to 30% of patients. The initial evaluation of HIV infection is not only directed at determining the clinical, virological (plasma HIV RNA viral load, resistance test and viral tropism) and immunological (CD4+ T-cell cell count) situation of the patients, but must also address the study of their co-infections (hepatitis, tuberculosis) and comorbidities (cardiovascular, hepatic, renal and bone) and the risk of HIV transmission. This is needed in order to decide, whether or not to start antiretroviral treatment, and with which combined antiretroviral treatment to start with, the prophylaxis of opportunistic infections, and the treatment of coinfections and comorbidities. The past and current medical history, the physical examination and laboratory tests will help us decide if the patient is to receive therapeutic intervention. The level of CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes is the best marker to suggest when to start combined antiretroviral treatment, indicating whether or not to start prophylaxis against opportunistic infections (if patients have a CD4+ T-cell count below 200 cells/mm(3)), and in advanced patients should make us suspect the presence of active opportunistic diseases in symptomatic cases. The management of patients with HIV infection must also include appropriate health education on the modes of transmission and prevention of HIV infection, and also to explain its natural history and how it can be modified with proper antiretroviral treatment, as well as to promote a healthy life. No less important is the psychological support, as these patients must learn to live with a chronic infection, which managed properly can ensure a very good long-term prognosis and quality of life."
3703,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are associated with persistent immune killing of infected hepatocytes. Hepatocytes constitute a largely self-renewing population. Thus, immune killing may exert selective pressure on the population, leading it to evolve in order to survive. A gradual course of hepatocyte evolution toward an HBV-resistant state is suggested by the substantial decline in the fraction of infected hepatocytes that occurs during the course of chronic infections. Consistent with hepatocyte evolution, clones of >1,000 hepatocytes develop postinfection in the noncirrhotic livers of chimpanzees chronically infected with HBV and of woodchucks infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (W. S. Mason, A. R. Jilbert, and J. Summers, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102:1139-1144, 2005; W. S. Mason et al., J. Virol. 83:8396-8408, 2009). The present study was carried out to determine (i) if extensive clonal expansion of hepatocytes also occurred in human HBV carriers, particularly in the noncirrhotic liver, and (ii) if clonal expansion included normal-appearing hepatocytes, not just hepatocytes that appear premalignant. Host DNA extracted from fragments of noncancerous liver, collected during surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), was analyzed by inverse PCR for randomly integrated HBV DNA as a marker of expanding hepatocyte lineages. This analysis detected extensive clonal expansion of hepatocytes, as previously found in chronically infected chimpanzees and woodchucks. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and DNA was extracted from the adjacent section for inverse PCR to detect integrated HBV DNA. This analysis revealed that clonal expansion can occur among normal-appearing human hepatocytes."
4250,0.005,1.0000,"Although there is discordance between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) blood plasma and seminal plasma viral loads (VL), little is known about the dynamics of VL rebound in these compartments upon discontinuation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Therefore, we sought to examine the relationship between blood and semen VL rebound after discontinuation of HAART. Participants in this substudy were men enrolled from two centers of a multicenter, placebo-controlled randomized trial of HIV therapeutic vaccination using ALVAC with or without Remune. With at least 2 years of sustained virologic suppression and following a 20-week vaccination course, subjects underwent structured HAART interruption. Fourteen men provided semen samples. Seven to 12 weeks after HAART interruption, all 14 men had detectable blood VLs whereas 8 of 14 had detectable seminal VLs. There was a significant correlation between blood and seminal VLs (Spearman r=0.58, p=0.03) at the time of semen collection. An earlier time to detectable blood VL after HAART interruption was associated with higher seminal VL (Spearman r=-0.64, p=0.02). These findings support the compartmentalization of HIV and underscore the importance of understanding the genital tract as an HIV reservoir in the quest to minimize HIV transmission."
3864,0.005,1.0000,"Laboratory evaluation of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) may involve detection of antibodies to HIV-1, direct detection of HIV-1 itself, and measurement of an individual's immunologic status at the time of presentation. The ELISA is currently the preferred initial screening test, although a variety of other rapid immunoassays have also been developed. Methods defining the antigenic specificity of the antibody response, such as the western blot, have become standard confirmatory tests in this setting. CD4+ cell enumeration and the HIV-1 antigen capture assay are useful in predicting the course of HIV-1 infection and in monitoring antiretroviral therapies. Newer techniques of HIV-1 co-cultivation permit the characterization of viral isolates and the stratification of patients and facilitate monitoring of the effects of antiretroviral agents. The polymerase chain reaction is of value in identifying HIV-1 infection in individuals with inconclusive serologic results. Judicious use of other laboratory tests, including surrogate markers such as beta 2-microglobulin, also provides prognostic information potentially useful in clinical management of HIV-1-infected patients."

The heterozygous genotype 6/5 showed a significant increased risk of HIV-1 infection (OR 3.03, 95% CI 0.99-9.33, p 0.046). Moreover, after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-1-seropositive individuals carrying the 6/5, 7/5 and 7/7 genotypes and alleles 5, 6 and 7 showed good CD4(+) T-cell recovery. In addition, individuals with the 7/5, 6/6 and 7/7 genotypes showed a significant decrease in viral load during the treatment period as compared with baseline (p < 0.05). Interestingly, we found that alleles 4 and 6 were associated with protection against AIDS progression.

2665,0.005,1.0000,"Jet injectors may transmit blood-borne infections, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To evaluate the safety of an anticontaminant disposable device which protects the jet injector apparatus, 22,714 healthy subjects were intradermally inoculated (38,162 inoculations) with a variety of vaccines. All the subjects were systematically followed-up clinically and epidemiologically for 6-18 months after inoculation; blood samples from 1619 subjects, before and 60-75 days after inoculation, were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV. Before vaccination 212 (13.09%) subjects were positive: 204 positive for HBV markers and eight for the HCV marker. None of the subjects were positive for the anti-HIV marker. During the clinico-epidemiological surveillance and the laboratory investigations mentioned above no clinical viral hepatitis B or C case and no seroconversion to positivity for HBV or HCV markers among the susceptible persons in the group were reported. Considering that in similar situations there is a theoretical risk of transmission as high as 1 per 388 to 1 per 3367 injections and that in our case 38,162 inoculations were performed in 22,714 subjects with the same Dermojet protected by the same type of anticontaminant disposable device, no contamination risk being reported, the conclusion can be reached that jet injectors can be safely used in the medical practice if they are protected by the sterile anticontaminant disposable device."

To determine the prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including gonorrhoea, Chlamydia, herpes simplex type 2 and syphilis among FSWs. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 278 FSWs in Shiraz, by using respondent-driven sampling, from June to March 2010. The recruitment chain started with 14 seeds, and FSWs were tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex type 2, gonorrhoea and Chlamydia. HIV prevalence was 4.7% (13/278); the most prevalent STI was herpes simplex type 2, 9.7% (27/278), followed by Chlamydia 9% (25/278), gonorrhoea 1.4% (4/278) and syphilis (0/278). The FSWs reported drug use (69.9%) of which 16.4% had history of injecting drug use. Unprotected sex in the past month was reported by 24.4% of FSWs. Urgent education and risk reduction programmes are needed in this population. "
3889,0.005,1.0000,"No evidence-based interventions (EBIs) have been designed for implementation during the critical period when HIV-infected prisoners are being transitioned from prison to the community. We therefore conducted formative research aimed at systematically selecting and adapting an EBI that integrates HIV risk reduction and adherence to antiretroviral therapy to implement among HIV-infected prisoners transitioning back to the community. Our formative research involved a critical examination of established EBIs and associated published reports complemented by data elicited through structured interviews with key stakeholders in community and correctional settings and members of the target population. Between September 2006 and February 2007, structured one-on-one interviews were conducted with key stakeholders in the target organizations (n = 19) and with members of the target population (n = 26) in Hartford and New Haven, Connecticut. Based on the formative research, we abbreviated and adapted the Holistic Health Recovery Program targeting people living with HIV (HHRP+), an EBI, to consist of four 45-minute sessions that cover a range of prespecified topics so that participants may individually apply intervention content as needed to their own HIV risk profile and antiretroviral adherence issues. The EBI was adapted so that it could be provided in an individual or group format and delivered in either consecutive or weekly sessions and so that it could be provided within the prison system and delivered just prior to release, or in a community-based setting where it could be delivered immediately after release. This study provides a comprehensive exemplar of the process of selecting and adapting an EBI taking into account both empirical evidence and input from target organization stakeholders and target population members in real-world settings where high-risk populations are concentrated."
1361,0.005,1.0000,"A prospective study of 149 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seroconverters was conducted to describe trends and correlates of HIV-1 load after seroconversion and over time. HIV-1 load was quantified from frozen sera by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. High early virus load was associated with lower CD4 cell counts and male sex but not with age at seroconversion or injection drug use. Early virus load predicted progression to clinical AIDS and AIDS/<200 CD4 cells/microL. Virus load exhibited a decline of 52% by 18 months after seroconversion then increased 23% annually (95% confidence interval, 13%-33%). Men and those developing AIDS during follow-up had higher virus loads over the course of disease. Persons who developed AIDS had a steeper virus load slope than those who were AIDS-free (P=.01). In long-term follow-up, virus load exhibited a gradual and sustained increase over time. Virus load and annual increase are strong predictors of disease progression."

Participants were 73 men and women with HIV infection drawn from a larger sample of 186 clinical trial patients. Based on inclusion criteria, parent trial participants taking antiretroviral therapies, and those with complete data on self-reported measures of adherence were considered eligible for the present study. Overall, 26% of participants were found to be nonadherent, which was defined as one or more missed doses of treatment in the prior 4-day period. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine associations of sociodemographic and psychosocial variables with adherence to antiretroviral regimen. Results indicated that heterosexual participants (p < 0.01) and participants of Latino ethnicity (p < 0.05) were significantly more likely to report missed medications. Perceived satisfaction with support from a partner was associated with taking antiretroviral therapy as prescribed, whereas satisfaction with support from friends and from family was not significantly related to adherence. Examination of coping strategies showed that participants reporting drug and alcohol use (p <.05) to cope with HIV-related stress were more likely to be nonadherent. These findings call for adherence interventions designed to address barriers and strengths, such as community norms or traditional cultural values, specific to certain populations. Furthermore, couple-based approaches enlisting partner support may help persons living with HIV to adhere to antiretroviral regimens."

All AIDS patients and 68% (101/149) of the homosexual males were HIV seropositive upon entering the study. Of those 48 (32%) homosexuals who were HIV negative at the onset, three seroconverted during the two year observation period. Retrospective studies of the HIV(-) subjects' sequentially stored serum samples demonstrated an early transient appearance of gag encoded p24 antigen (Ag) which preceded their production of NA and specific anti-p24 Ab. Following their seroconversion, no more circulating p24 Ag could be detected. Among the 101 HIV positive homosexuals, 16% rapidly progressed to AIDS and seven of these 16 (44%) subjects eventually died during the two year observation period. In this group of individuals with poor prognosis, presence of NA and anti-p24 Ab commenced at the onset reaching peak levels just prior to developing AIDS and began to decline as the clinical course worsened. Their circulating level of p24 Ag remained undetectable as long as there was quantifiable NA and anti-p24 Ab in their sera. Reappearance of circulatory p24 Ag, on the other hand, was associated with high risk for progression to AIDS.2+hus, while only 11"

Initial evaluation of these parameters was conducted in the western countries where accessible ARVs, circulating HIV subtypes and mode of transmission are different from the situation in Nigeria. This study appraised these parameters, and efficacy of generic ARVs. Consenting 106 HIV infected ARV na√Øve patients were enrolled. CD4 T lymphocyte and plasma HIV RNA levels were determined at interval for 24 months. Ninety eight (92.5%) of the patients who completed the follow up in strict adherence to therapy guideline were included in the analysis. Baseline median CD4 T lymphocyte increased from 114 (Range: 6-330) to highest 357 (Range: 15-1036) cells/ Œº L at 18 months of therapy, while baseline median plasma viral RNA declined from 4.6 (Range: 2.6-6.0) Log10 copies/mL to undetectable level within three months of therapy. Significant CD4 T-cell restoration and plasma viral RNA decline in the study population demonstrate efficacy of the generic HAART. The importance of combined use of both parameters for evaluation of immunologic and virologic responses to ART was confirmed. "
2215,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) early gene product Nef is a multifunctional protein that alters numerous pathways of T-cell function, including endocytosis, signal transduction, vesicular trafficking, and immune modulation, and is a major determinant of pathogenesis. Individual Nef functions include PAK-2 activation, CD4 downregulation, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I downregulation, and enhancement of viral particle infectivity. How Nef accomplishes its multiple tasks presents a difficult problem of mechanistic analysis because of the complications associated with multiple, overlapping functional domains in the context of significant sequence variability. To address these issues we determined the conservation of each Nef residue based on 1,643 subtype B Nef sequences. Mutational analysis based on conservative substitutions and Nef sequence data allowed us to search for amino acids on the surface of Nef that are specifically required for PAK-2 activation. We found residues 85, 89, and 191 to be highly significant determinants for Nef's PAK-2 activation function but functionally unlinked to CD4 and MHC class I downregulation or enhancement of infectivity. These residues are not conserved across HIV-1 subtypes but are confined to separate sets of surface elements within a subtype. Thus, L85/H89/F191 and F85/F89/R191 are dominant in subtype B and subtype E or C, respectively. Our results provide support for developing subtype-specific interventions in HIV-1 disease."

The aim of this study presents the most extensive HIV-1 molecular epidemiology investigation in Hebei province in China thus far. We have carried out the most extensive systematic cross-sectional study based on newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive individuals in 2013, and characterized the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequences in the whole of Hebei. Nine HIV-1 genotypes based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequence were identified among 610 newly diagnosed na√Øve individuals. The four main genotypes were circulating recombinant form (CRF)01_AE (53.4%), CRF07_BC (23.4%), subtype B (15.9%), and unique recombinant forms URFs (4.9%). Within 1 year, three new genotypes (subtype A1, CRF55_01B, CRF65_cpx), unknown before in Hebei, were first found among men who have sex with men (MSM). All nine genotypes were identified in the sexually contracted HIV-1 population. Among 30 URFs, six recombinant patterns were revealed, including CRF01_AE/BC (40.0%), CRF01_AE/B (23.3%), B/C (16.7%), CRF01_AE/C (13.3%), CRF01_AE/B/A2 (3.3%) and CRF01_AE/BC/A2 (3.3%), plus two potential CRFs. This study elucidated the complicated characteristics of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology in a low HIV-1 prevalence northern province of China and revealed the high level of HIV-1 genetic diversity. All nine HIV-1 genotypes circulating in Hebei have spread out of their initial risk groups into the general population through sexual contact, especially through MSM. This highlights the urgency of HIV prevention and control in China."
6034,0.005,1.0000,"Major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are part of the cellular immune response to persistent virus infections. Candidate vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) should elicit broad cross-reactive immunity to confer protection against different strains of HIV-1. As it is likely that candidate vaccines will include the envelope gene product Env, we determined the proportion of CTL clones which recognized variable and conserved determinants in three env variants during natural infection. Limiting dilution analysis was used to characterize numerous short-term CTL clones derived from peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected subjects, using split-well analysis to assay cytotoxicity against target cells expressing gp160env of HIV-1 strains IIIB, MN, and RF. In 9 of 12 HIV-1-infected subjects, at the clonal level most env-specific CTL recognized determinant(s) within one env variant but not in the other variants. In some subjects, CTL recognized multiple nonconserved determinants in different variants. The pattern of recognition of different env variants was relatively stable over time. In most of the patients studied, the proportion of CTL which showed cross-recognition of conserved determinants shared among the three strains was low. Two novel CTL epitopes within gp41 were identified by using 15-mer peptides of the HIV-SF2 sequence. When specific peptide was used to stimulate CTL precursors in vitro, the frequency of peptide-specific CTL precursors was very high, but the CTL elicited by this stimulation were highly strain specific. We conclude that the use of a single HIV env variant to detect CTL activity can underestimate the magnitude and complexity of the env-specific CTL response. The low prevalence of CTL clones which show cross-recognition of conserved determinants may have implications for immunization strategies based solely on env; to elicit broadly cross-reactive CTL other, more conserved viral antigens are likely to be needed in addition to env. Because of its capacity to distinguish CTL responses against different virus strains, limiting dilution analysis is particularly appropriate to quantitate the immune responses generated by candidate env-based vaccines."
8908,0.005,1.0000,"Following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration into host cell DNA, the viral promoter can become transcriptionally silent in the absence of appropriate signals and factors. HIV-1 gene expression is dependent on regulatory elements contained within the long terminal repeat (LTR) that drive the synthesis of viral RNAs and proteins through interaction with multiple host and viral factors. Previous studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and Sp site III (3T, C-to-T change at position 3, and 5T, C-to-T change at position 5 of the binding site, respectively, when compared to the consensus B sequence) that are low affinity binding sites and correlate with more advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. Stably transfected cell lines containing the wild type, 3T, 5T, and 3T5T LTRs were developed utilizing bone marrow progenitor, T, and monocytic cell lines to explore the LTR phenotypes associated with these genotypic changes from an integrated chromatin-based microenvironment. Results suggest that in nonexpressing cell clones LTR-driven gene expression occurs in a SNP-specific manner in response to LTR activation or treatment with trichostatin A treatment, indicating a possible cell type and SNP-specific mechanism behind the epigenetic control of LTR activation.

2341,0.005,1.0000,"It is becoming increasingly important to identify and to study human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) with evidence of epidemic spread, since mosaic strains arise frequently, especially in populations where multiple subtypes cocirculate. We describe the almost complete nucleotide sequence of 3 subtype C and D recombinant viruses, selected from a pool of 13 D(gag)-D/C/D(env) perinatally infected infants from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. All three genomes had cross-over points with approximately the same genomic localization. The subtype C-like sequences were located within pol, vif, vpr, vpu, the first exons of rev and tat, V3, and the U3-R regions of the LTR. Phylogenetic analyses of the full-length genomic sequences from these viruses showed the formation of a distinct subcluster on the HIV-1 subtype D branch. The pattern of recombination of genomes belonging to this new CRF, named CRF10_CD, might have resulted from independent recombination events occurring at high frequency or from a single source that originated earlier in this population. Future surveys will be needed to determine the potential of this CRF for epidemic spread."
2295,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered to be the most important target for the diagnosis and immune prophylaxis of HBV infection. HBsAg-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are extensively used for studying the complex structure of the HBsAg, mapping the neutralizing epitopes and development of HBV diagnostic tests. However, the efficiency of anti-HBV binding strongly depends on the epitope structure and MAb capability to recognize different HBV variants. In the current study, 9 MAbs against yeast-expressed HBsAg of ayw2 serotype were generated and 7 of them were shown to recognize a linear epitope comprising amino acid (aa) residues 119-GPCRTCT-125 within the main antigenic ""a"" determinant of HBsAg. One MAb of the highest affinity (clone HB1) was selected for detailed cross-reactivity studies, generation of recombinant single-chain antibody (scFv) and molecular modelling of antibody-epitope interaction. The importance of each aa residue within the identified MAb epitope was determined by alanine substitution study that revealed aa residues C(121), T(123), C(124) and T(125) as essential for binding. These aa residues are highly conserved among HBV variants. In contrast, alanine substitution of G119, P120 and R122 had no or minor influence on the reactivity with the MAb. Certain aa residues at position 122 (either R or K) define different HBV serotypes (either d or y), therefore, the affinity of the MAb HB1 for the epitope with R122K substitution was determined to evaluate its diagnostic potential. The MAb recognized both epitope variants with high affinity. Sequence alignment of the MAb epitope within different HBV strains demonstrated that the shortest peptide recognized by the MAb 121-CR(K)TCT-125 is identical among different human HBV genotypes (HBV A-F, H) and monkey HBV species (HBVCP, HBVGO, HBVGB, WMHBV). In line with these data, the MAb HB1 was cross-reactive in Western blot with a large panel of antigens derived from different HBV genotypes. Recombinant scFv consisting of immunoglobulin VH and VL regions joined by a 20 aa-long linker was generated by cloning the respective cDNA sequences from hybridoma HB1. The recombinant scFv generated in Escherichia coli recognized the same epitope as the parental MAb HB1. Cloning of HB1 VH and VL regions allowed determination of their primary structure and subsequent computer modeling of antibody-epitope interaction. The generated molecular models of HB1 variable region with its target peptides were in accordance with experimental data showing the importance of certain aa residues in antibody binding. In conclusion, the current study describes new HBsAg-specific antibodies with HBV-neutralizing potency and a broad cross-reactivity against different HBV strains. The generated MAb HB1 will be of great value in diagnostic and research settings, while the recombinant HB1-derived scFv represents a promising ""building block"" for producing anti-HBV tools with a potential biopharmaceutical application.

5703,0.005,1.0000,"With ongoing earlier enrollment on and rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cameroon, there are increasing risks of transmitted HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) at population levels. We, therefore, evaluated the threshold of HIVDR in a population initiating ART, to inform on the effectiveness of first-line regimens, considering HIV-1 diversity, plasma viral load (PVL), and CD4-based disease progression. A total of 53 adults [median (interquartile range, IQR) CD4: 162 cell/mm(3) (48-284); median (IQR) PVL: 5.34 log10 RNA (4.17-6.42) copies/ml] initiating ART in 2014 at the Yaound√© Central Hospital were enrolled for HIV-1 protease-reverse transcriptase sequencing. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were interpreted using the 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) list versus the Stanford HIVdb algorithm version 7.0. Level of DRMs was low (3.77%) versus moderate (7.55%), respectively, following the WHO list (T69D, K103N) versus Stanford HIVdb (T69D, A98G, K103N, K238T), respectively. Prevailing clade was CRF02_AG (71.70%). Based on Stanford HIVdb, a slightly higher proportion of patients with DRMs were found among ones infected with CRF02_AG than in those non-CRF02_AG infected (7.89% vs. 6.67%, p = 1.000), with lower PVL (7.69% <5.5 vs. 0% ‚â•5.5 log10 RNA copies/ml, p = .488) and with higher CD4 counts (9.52% CD4 ‚â•200 vs. 3.33% CD4 <200 cells/mm(3), p = .749). Thresholds of DRMs suggest that standard first-line regimens currently used in Cameroon may remain effective at population levels, despite scale-up of ART in the country, pending adherence, and closed virological monitoring. With an intent-to-diagnose approach, the discrepant levels of DRMs support using Stanford HIVdb to evaluate initial ART, while revising the WHO list for surveillance."

Causes (including HIV symptoms, quality of life, depression, herbal treatment and alcohol use) for discontinuing ART follow-up in predominantly rural resource-limited settings are not well understood. This is a prospective study of the treatment-na√Øve patients recruited from three (one urban, one-semi-urban and one rural) public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal from October 2007 to February 2008. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of loss to follow-up or all caused attrition from an ART programme within a cohort followed up for over 12 months. A total of 735 patients (217 men and 518 women) prior to initiating ART completed a baseline questionnaire and 6- and 12-months' follow-up. At 12-months follow-up 557 (75.9%) individuals continued active ART, 177 (24.1%) were all cause attrition, there were 82 deaths (13.8%), 58 (7.9%) transfers, 7 (1.0%) refused participation, 8 (1.1%) were not yet on ART and 22 (3.0%) could not be traced. Death by 12-months of follow-up was associated with lower CD4 cell counts (risk ratio, RR=2.05, confidence intervals, CI=1.20-3.49) and higher depression levels (RR=1.05, CI=1.01-1.09) at baseline assessment. The high early mortality rates indicate that patients are enrolling into ART programmes with far too advanced immunodeficiency; median CD4 cell counts 119 (IQR=59-163). Causes of late access to the ART programme, such as delays in health care access (delayed health care seeking), health system delays, or inappropriate treatment criteria, need to be addressed. Differences in health status (lower CD4 cell counts and higher depression scores) should be taken into account when initiating patients on ART. Treating depression at ART initiation is recommended to improve treatment outcome."
5675,0.005,1.0000,"Arginase I (Arg I) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are important in regulating immune functions through their metabolites. Previous studies have revealed that the expression of Arg I is increased and the expression of iNOS is reduced in the serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)‚Äëinfected patients. As one of the most important immune organs and HIV replication sites, whether similar changes are present in the lymph nodes following HIV infection remains to be elucidated. To investigate this, the present study collected lymph node and blood specimens from 52 HIV‚Äëinfected patients to measure the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS by immunohistochemistry and fluoresence‚Äëbased flow cytometry. Compared with control subjects without HIV infection, the patients with HIV had significantly higher expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and higher frequencies of Arg I+ CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the blood and lymph nodes, and these results were contrary the those of iNOS in the corresponding compartments. The expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and blood were negatively associated with peripheral CD4+ T cell count and positively associated with viral load. However, the expression levels of iNOS in the lymph nodes and blood were positively associated with peripheral CD4+ T cell count and negatively associated with viral load. These results showed that alterations in the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in the peripheral T cells and peripheral nodes of HIV infected patients are associated with disease progression in these patients. These results indicate a potential to therapeutic strategy for delaying disease progression through regulating and manipulating the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in patients infected with HIV."
8624,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of our study was to determine a minimum threshold CD4 count for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation in HIV-infected patients. A schema using longitudinal data from a clinical cohort was designed. The presenting CD4 counts of asymptomatic HIV-infected patients in Hong Kong were evaluated in relation to their progression to AIDS within 1 year of diagnosis of HIV infection. A graph was generated to depict the changes in the percentage of cumulative AIDS diagnoses for every 10 cell/microL increase in presenting CD4 count. Of 181 patients, 24 had developed AIDS within 1 year of diagnosis of HIV infection. Setting the CD4 count threshold at 150 cells/microL gave a good balance between the number of preventable AIDS-defining events and the number of non-AIDS patients initiating HAART. No extra AIDS-defining events occurred when the CD4 count threshold was reduced from 200 to 150 cells/microL, despite the addition of 13 more patients. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, presenting CD4 count was a significant predictor for AIDS occurrence. The relative hazard for AIDS occurrence of patients with presenting CD4 counts <or=150 cells/microL was 27-fold greater. We suggest a CD4 count of 150 cells/microL as the minimum threshold for HAART initiation in a cohort of Chinese HIV-infected patients. At this level, 20.8% of the AIDS-defining events could be prevented. While a cut-off of 200 cells/microL remains a standard for considering HAART initiation, the minimum threshold signifies a critical moment for timely intervention to be introduced."
4576,0.005,1.0000,"In 2004, Cambodia, a low-income country, undertook a rapid scale-up of free antiretroviral therapy (ART) through the public sector in order to respond to the need for treatment for those living with HIV/AIDS. A cohort of patients initiating ART in a provincial national hospital was set up at the beginning of the program to monitor the impact of treatment on patients. Patients provided information on behaviors through face-to-face interviews. Medical data were obtained from clinical files. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 21-Items Short Form (MOS SF-21). Patients were interviewed when initiating ART and followed up at 3 months, 6 months, and each consecutive 6 months thereafter. From March 2005 through January 2008, the cohort included 549 patients followed for a total of 645 person-years. The 4.0% of patients lost to follow-up were considered dead in the analysis. Incidence of mortality was 9.1 per 100 person-years, which is comparable to international standards. HRQOL subscale scores increased dramatically in the first year after initiating ART. The mean of overall HRQOL score rose from 63.0 at baseline to 81.1 at 1 year and 89.9 at 30 months of follow-up (chi(2) for trends p < 0.001). Simultaneously, the proportion of patients with full-time employment increased from 48.8% to 95.7%.We conclude that the rapid scaling-up of ART delivery in a resource poor Asian setting dramatically improved the survival and well-being of its beneficiaries, who in turn resumed productive lives within their communities."
7846,0.005,1.0000,"The rapidity of HIV-RNA suppression after initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) may impact immune reconstitution in developing countries, where patients initiate cART at low CD4 T cell counts. One hundred and thirty-five HIV-1 Mozambican adults initiating cART were prospectively followed over 16 months within a larger observational study. Plasma HIV-RNA, CD4 counts, and CD8 T cell activation were monitored at the pre-cART visit and at 4, 10, and 16 months during cART. Of the 89 patients with available HIV-RNA data at pre-cART and 4 and 10 months post-cART, 68% (60/89) suppressed HIV-RNA at 4 months and were defined as ""early virological controllers""(EC). Twenty of the 29 remaining patients who did not control HIV-RNA at 4 months did so at 10 months and were classified as ""late virological controllers""(LC). Nine (10%) patients did not control HIV-RNA at either time point. Both initiating an EFV-containing cART regimen and having pre-cART tuberculosis were significantly associated with early HIV-RNA suppression if locked into a multivariate model [EFV OR: 13.6 (95% CI 1.7; 108.1) p = 0.014) tuberculosis OR: 11.0 (95% CI 1.4; 87.9) p = 0.024]. EC demonstrated significantly lower median activated CD8 T cells at 4, 10, and 16 months post-cART than did LC. Approximately 63% (12/19) of LC experienced reappearance of detectable HIV-RNA at 6 months postcontrol as compared to 15% (2/60) of EC (p = 0.001). This study suggests that rapid suppression of HIV-RNA may lead to a lower rate of reappearance of HIV-RNA, which could impact CD8 T cell activation levels in patients initiating cART at low CD4 counts."
3057,0.005,1.0000,"The woodchuck together with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) is an excellent model to study the pathogenesis of hepadnaviral infections. Chronic WHV infection causes severe liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma in woodchucks. The mechanism of viral clearance is not fully understood, interferons seem to play a major role in down-regulating viral replication prior to elimination of infected hepatocytes. We investigated on the pattern of cytokine and T-cell-marker expression in livers of woodchucks chronically infected with WHV. RNase-protection-assay (RPA) was used to determine mRNA of woodchuck specific genes (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-15, CD3, CD4, CD8). Serial liver biopsies were performed daily or weekly in eight chronic WHV-carrier woodchucks. Cytokine/T-cell-marker expression differed significantly between the time points up to +/-50% within each woodchuck. The different expression patterns of cytokines or T-cell-markers did not correlate to the (weak) fluctuations in the viremia but may explain the observed fluctuations in the WHV/HBV-load in chronically infected individuals. Furthermore, we observed associations between cytokine and T-cell-marker expression. The marginal fluctuations in viremia during the chronic infection may indicate, that, once the chronic hepadnaviral infection is established, cytokines/interferons expressed endogenously (i.e. not vector-borne or injected) play only a minor role."

SECOND-LINE study participants were assessed at baseline for HIV-1 subtype, demographics, HIV-1 history, ART exposure, viral load (VL), CD4(+) count, and genotypic ART resistance. We used backward stepwise multivariate regression (MVR) to assess associations between baseline variables and presence of ‚â•3 N(t)RTI mutations, ‚â•1 NNRTI mutation, ‚â•3 thymidine analog-N(t)RTI [ta-N(t)RTI] mutations (TAMs), the K65/K70 mutation, and predicted etravirine (ETV)/rilpivirine (RPV) activity.

867,0.005,1.0000,"The extent of zoonotic infections in rural Sierra Leone, where both feral and pet sooty mangabeys harbor divergent members of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2)-sooty mangabey simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVsm) family, was tested in blood samples collected from 9,309 human subjects in 1993. Using HIV-1- and HIV-2-specific enzyme immunoassays and confirmatory Western blot analysis to test for antibodies to SIVsm-related lentiviruses, we found only nine subjects (0.096%) who tested positive for HIV: seven tested positive for HIV-1 and two tested positive for HIV-2. Compared with other rural West African communities, Sierra Leone displayed the lowest seroprevalence (0.021%) of HIV-2 infection yet reported, much lower than the previously reported seroprevalence in SIVsm-infected feral and household pet sooty mangabeys. Heteroduplex analysis demonstrated that two of the newly found HIV-1 strains belonged to subtype A, the most common HIV-1 subtype in Africa, but this is the first report of subtype A in Sierra Leone. The two HIV-2-infected individuals harbored two distinct HIV-2 strains, designated 93SL1 and 93SL2. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that HIV-2 93SL1 is a member of HIV-2 subtype A, the first strain of this HIV-2 subtype found in Sierra Leone. In contrast, HIV-2 93SL2 belongs to none of the five previously characterized HIV-2 subtypes (A to E) but is a new subtype, herein designated F, having the most divergent transmembrane sequences yet reported for HIV-2. The fact that both of the two most divergent HIV-2 subtypes known, E and F, are rare and found as single occurrences in persons from Sierra Leone may be related to the fact that this small region of West Africa also contains free-living and household pet sooty mangabeys with highly divergent variants of SIVsm. This finding provides support for the hypotheses that new HIV-2 subtypes result from independent cross-species transmission of SIVsm to the human population and that these single-occurrence transmission events had not spread widely into the population by 1993."
254,0.005,1.0000,"Although herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is not regarded as an opportunistic infection, the occurrence of HSE in immunocompromised patients has been documented and the suggestion made that unusual clinical and neuropathologic features characterize the disorder in this population. To further characterize HSE as it affects the immunodeficient, the authors reviewed the clinical and pathological findings in three immunocompromised patients with autopsy-proven HSE. Two patients had cancer (one with lymphoma and another with glioblastoma multiforme), one was known to be human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1)-seropositive and a second was suspected of harboring underlying HIV-1 infection. Two were receiving dexamethasone at onset of HSE. All had fever, mental status changes and new, focal neurological deficits or worsening of established deficits. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis was absent or minimal and head computerized tomographic (CT) scans, performed in all cases, were unrevealing. No patient was clinically suspected of having HSE, only one received acyclovir (for concurrent mucocutaneous herpes) and HSE played a major role in all deaths. Autopsy revealed an unusual form of HSE characterized by a noninflammatory, pseudoischemic histological presentation and the unexpected persistence of viral antigens in abundance despite survival beyond the clinical stage during which inflammatory responses usually peak and productive brain infection wanes. The incidence of HSE in the immunocompromised may be underestimated. Preexistent neurological disease, a noninflammatory CSF profile and negative CT scan may confound the diagnosis in this population, a typical clinical presentation notwithstanding. Increased clinical suspicion, the use of magnetic resonance imaging and polymerase chain reaction analysis of CSF for herpes simplex virus nucleic acid sequences may permit more rapid diagnosis and treatment. The absence of inflammatory infiltrates in some fatal cases of HSE suggests that an intact immune response is not requisite to the devastating neurological injury characteristic of this disorder."
3916,0.005,1.0000,"Numerous African primates are infected with simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). It is now well established that the clade of SIVs infecting west-central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) represent the progenitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), whereas HIV-2 results from different cross-species transmissions of SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys). We present here the first molecular epidemiological survey of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVwrc) in wild-living western red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus badius badius) which are frequently hunted by the human population and represent a favourite prey of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). We collected faecal samples (n=88) and we assessed individual discrimination by microsatellite analyses and visual observation. We tested the inferred 53 adult individuals belonging to two neighbouring habituated groups for presence of SIVwrc infection by viral RNA (vRNA) detection. We amplified viral polymerase (pol) (650 bp) and/or envelope (env) (570 bp) sequences in 14 individuals, resulting in a minimal prevalence of 26% among the individuals sampled, possibly reaching 50% when considering the relatively low sensitivity of viral RNA detection in faecal samples. With a few exceptions, phylogenetic analysis of pol and env sequences revealed a low degree of intragroup genetic diversity and a general viral clustering related to the social group of origin. However, we found a higher intergroup diversity. Behavioural and demographic data collected previously from these communities indicate that red colobus monkeys live in promiscuous multi-male societies, where females leave their natal group at the sub-adult stage of their lives and where extra-group copulations or male immigration have been rarely observed. The phylogenetic data we obtained seem to reflect these behavioural characteristics. Overall, our results indicate that wild-living red colobus represent a substantial reservoir of SIVwrc. Moreover, because of their frequent association with other monkey species, the predation pressure exerted by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and by poachers around and inside the park, simian to simian and simian to human SIVwrc cross-species transmission cannot be excluded."
8125,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) increases the risk of tuberculosis (TB), and HIV TB coinfection is associated with higher mortality. This study aimed to characterize patients coinfected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV in a reference centre for cases involving complications or drug resistance in TB. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a Hospital for Tropical Diseases in the state of Goi√°s, Midwestern Brazil. Patients' medical records were reviewed between January 2008 and December 2009. Sixty-one cases of TB/HIV coinfection were evaluated, and 54 HIV-seronegative TB cases were selected as controls. The prevalence of TB HIV coinfected patients in 2008/2009 was 23%. Coinfection was more prevalent in men (75.4%), with a mean age of 37.1 years. Pulmonary disease (50.8%) was the most frequent clinical form of TB in coinfected patients, followed by disseminated disease (32.8%). Anaemia, malnutrition and low levels of CD4 T lymphocytes were found in about 80% of coinfected patients. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were the most common radiographic finding in coinfected patients (51.8%), and pulmonary cavitation was the rarest event (5.4%). The mortality rate was 2.8 times higher in the TB HIV coinfected group (39.3%) than in TB patients without HIV (18.5%). Actions targeting the TB HIV-coinfected population, based on national and international recommendations, are necessary to improve prognosis and outcomes in TB and HIV infection in the institution."

In Thailand as part of a sentinel surveillance system, we collected data prospectively about pulmonary TB cases treated in public clinics. A subset of HIV-infected TB patients identified through this system had additional data collected for a research study. We conducted multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with MDR-TB. Of 10,428 TB patients, 2,376 (23%) were HIV-infected; 145 (1%) had MDR-TB. Of the MDR-TB cases, 52 (37%) were HIV-infected. Independent risk factors for MDR-TB included age 18-29 years old, male sex, and previous TB treatment, but not HIV infection. Among new patients, having an injection drug use history was a risk factor for MDR-TB. Of 539 HIV-infected TB patients in the research study, MDR-TB was diagnosed in 19 (4%); the only significant risk factors were previous TB treatment and previous hepatitis. In Thailand, HIV is common among MDR-TB patients, but is not an independent risk factor for MDR-TB. Populations at high risk for HIV-young adults, men, injection drug users - should be prioritized for drug susceptibility testing."
4563,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection alters the epidemiology of mycobacterial infections. In the industrialised world, this has led to an increase in severe illness associated with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and, in the developing world, to doubling of tuberculosis cases in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The interaction with Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs when the CD4 count is relatively high (> 200) and tuberculosis (TB) is now the commonest presenting AIDS defining disease in Africa. In international public health terms the interaction between TB and HIV infection has led to the World Health Organisation declaring TB to be a global emergency. Both TB and HIV are diseases of poverty and the key to the reduction of incidence of both diseases is the improvement of socio-economic conditions. Other control methods are case finding and treatment, chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccination. Finding active (sputum positive) case of tuberculosis and treating them is the function of TB control programmes in all countries, but poor adherence to medication has lead to low cure rates and increasing development of drug resistance. Resources are needed to improve adherence to medication and for research to improve diagnostic methods and treatment."

9224,0.005,1.0000,"The impact of hepatitis C virus infection (HCI), the most common bloodborne virus infection in the USA, on outcome of active tuberculosis (TB) treatment is largely unknown. We aimed to describe characteristics of TB patients with hepatitis C virus infection (TB-HCI) in King County, Washington, including TB treatment duration and outcome. We reviewed 1510 records of patients treated for active TB at the Public Health - Seattle & King County Tuberculosis Control Program between 2000 and 2010, and identified 53 with HCI. Advanced age, being born in the USA, HIV infection, homelessness and injection drug use were independently associated with HCI in TB cases. Independent factors associated with increased treatment duration included HIV infection, excess alcohol use, extrapulmonary TB, and any drug-resistant TB disease. Our findings suggest that TB-HCI patients can be successfully treated for active TB without extending treatment duration."
406,0.005,1.0000,"Increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) associated with HIV-1 infection is primarily attributed to deficient T helper (Th)1 immune responses, but most people with active TB have robust Th1 responses, indicating that these are not sufficient to protect against disease. Recent findings suggest that favourable outcomes following Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection arise from finely balanced inflammatory and regulatory pathways, achieving pathogen control without immunopathology. We hypothesised that HIV-1 and antiretroviral therapy (ART) exert widespread changes to cell mediated immunity, which may compromise the optimal host protective response to TB and provide novel insights into the correlates of immune protection and pathogenesis. We sought to define these effects in patients with active TB by transcriptional profiling of tuberculin skin tests (TST) to make comprehensive molecular level assessments of in vivo human immune responses at the site of a standardised mycobacterial challenge. We showed that the TST transcriptome accurately reflects the molecular pathology at the site of human pulmonary TB, and used this approach to investigate immune dysregulation in HIV-1/TB co-infected patients with distinct clinical phenotypes associated with TST reactivity or anergy and unmasking TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after initiation of ART. HIV-1 infected patients with positive TSTs exhibited preserved Th1 responses but deficient immunoregulatory IL10-inducible responses. Those with clinically negative TSTs revealed profound anergy of innate as well as adaptive immune responses, except for preservation of type 1 interferon activity, implicated in impaired anti-mycobacterial immunity. Patients with unmasking TB IRIS showed recovery of Th1 immunity to normal levels, but exaggerated Th2-associated responses specifically. These mechanisms of immune dysregulation were localised to the tissue microenvironment and not evident in peripheral blood. TST molecular profiling categorised different mechanisms of immunological dysfunction in HIV-1 infection beyond the effects on CD4 T cells, each associated with increased risk of TB disease and amenable to host-directed therapies.

The most common chest x-ray abnormality was a reticulonodular pattern or bilateral infiltrates (n=26). Serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were elevated in 17 (85%) of 20 of patients tested (mean value, 2208 U/L). Mean O(2) saturation and PO(2) were 89% and 64 mm Hg, respectively. A majority (24 patients [62%]) received both antituberculous and anti-PCP therapy (17 with steroids), and 22 improved. All ten patients who received no treatment for PCP improved and were discharged from the hospital, whereas 4 (80%) of the 5 persons who received no antituberculous treatment had a poor outcome (P<.001; OR=43).

3817,0.005,1.0000,"We conducted a survival analysis with competing risks to estimate the mortality rate and predictive factors for immunodeficiency-related death in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) in northeast Brazil. A cohort with 2372 PLWH was enrolled between July 2007 and June 2010 and monitored until 31 December 2012 at two healthcare centres. The event of interest was immunodeficiency-related death, which was defined based on the Coding Causes of Death in HIV Protocol (CoDe). The predictor variables were: sociodemographic characteristics, illicit drugs, tobacco, alcohol, nutritional status, antiretroviral therapy, anaemia and CD4 cell count at baseline; and treatment or chemoprophylaxis for tuberculosis (TB) during follow-up. We used Fine & Gray's model for the survival analyses with competing risks, since we had regarded immunodeficiency-unrelated deaths as a competing event, and we estimated the adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratios (SHRs). In 10 012¬∑6 person-years of observation there were 3¬∑1 deaths/100 person-years (2¬∑3 immunodeficiency-related and 0¬∑8 immunodeficiency-unrelated). TB (SHR 4¬∑01), anaemia (SHR 3¬∑58), CD4 <200 cells/mm3 (SHR 3¬∑33) and being unemployed (SHR 1¬∑56) were risk factors for immunodeficiency-related death. This study discloses a 13% coverage by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in our state and adds that anaemia at baseline or the incidence of TB may increase the specific risk of dying from HIV-immunodeficiency, regardless of HAART and CD4."
1762,0.005,1.0000,"Transcription of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is governed by the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). By using HIV-1 LTR-directed reporter gene systems, we found that the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin inhibits Tat-mediated transactivation of HIV-1 LTR. The 293.27.2 cells that carry a stably transfected HIV-1 LTR-directed lacZ gene expression vector (pNAZ) were used. Inhibitions of LTR were observed at camptothecin concentrations (IC50 about 0.03 microM, which was an order of magnitude lower than for Ro 24-7429), which had minor effects on cell survival, expression of the cellular gene gro, or Rous sarcoma virus-directed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression. Inhibition was also seen with RPMI 8402, which is a human CD4-positive lymphocyte line transiently transfected with a HIV-1 LTR-directed (CAT) gene. Experiments with HIV-1 LTR mutants suggest that transactivation response sequence but not NF-kappa B is responsible for the inhibition by camptothecin. The target for camptothecin may be a cellular factor that is important for the activation of HIV-1 LTR by Tat and thus may offer a potential target for therapy of HIV-1 infection."
590,0.005,1.0000,"Pentoxifylline (Trental), used routinely for the treatment of intermittent claudication, has been shown previously to decrease the levels of tumor necrosis factors-alpha (TNF-alpha) RNA in cancer patients and to lead to a general improvement of well being. Increased TNF-alpha levels have been observed not only in cancer patients but also in cachectic patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and TNF-alpha is known to increase the expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) via activating its long terminal repeat (LTR). Moreover, TNF-alpha decreases the therapeutic efficacy of zidovudine (AZT). Here we show a significant decrease in HIV-1 replication by pentoxifylline in infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The reduction was proportional to the downregulation of expression of a reporter gene, the bacterial gene for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, linked to the HIV-1 LTR in human monocytoid cells. We conclude that patients with AIDS may benefit from pentoxifylline treatment because of its blockage of TNF-alpha-mediated HIV-1 upregulation, from increased efficacy of AZT, and also from improvement in TNF-alpha-induced cachexia."

Of the 505 studied patients, four (0.79%) were positive for anti-HTLV1/2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with HTLV1 infection confirmed by line immunoassay (LIA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all of the ELISA-positive samples. No cases of HTLV2 infection were observed. The prevalence of HTLV1/HIV1 coinfection was 0.79% (4/505; 95% CI: 0.25-2.16). All the coinfected patients reported sexual risk behaviors and only one reported intravenous drug use. Sequencing of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) region and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the four HTLV1 isolates belonged to the Transcontinental a subgroup of the Cosmopolitan (1a) subtype, the most frequent subgroup detected in Brazil.

The aim of the study was to assess the impact of the international unit standard for measuring HCV RNA in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Twenty-seven na√Øve patients infected chronically by HCV were treated with ribavirin plus PEG-interferon-alfa-2b for 48 weeks. SVR was obtained for 16 patients (the other were non-responders). For HCV RNA quantitation, four assays were undertaken: Versant HCV RNA 3.0 (Bayer), Real time PCR (TaqMan, Roche), LCx HCV RNA (Abbott), and Cobas Amplicor-Monitor v2 (Roche). Considering a 2-log decline at Week 12 after the beginning of therapy, discordant results were found with the four HCV RNA methods in predicting SVR or non-response. At Week 4 and Week 12, significant differences were observed between Versant HCV RNA 3.0 versus PCR HCV Taqman, Versant HCV RNA 3.0 versus LCx HCV RNA, Cobas Monitor Amplicor HCV 2.0 versus LCx HCV RNA, and Cobas Monitor Amplicor HCV 2.0 versus PCR HCV Taqman (P < 0.001). The HCV RNA cutoff, given a 100% negative predictive value at Week 4 and Week 12, differed with the assays used to quantify HCV RNA, despite the use of the IU/ml units. Eighty-nine percent of serum values for HCV RNA were concordant by the IU standard. All assays, however, failed to detect HCV RNA in some cases. Despite the use of the IU standard HCV-infected patients might be monitored with only one assay."
9536,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a lentivirus that causes persistent infection resulting in the demise of immune regulatory cells, and ensuing diseases associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although current therapeutic modalities have had a significant impact on mortality rates, novel therapies are constantly needed to prevent the emergence of resistant viral variants that escape the effects of antivirals. RNA Interference (RNAi) is a promising therapeutic modality for the inhibition of HIV-1 RNAs. Traditionally, RNAi effector sequences include expressed short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Recently, expressed long hairpin RNAs (lhRNAs) have been used with the aim of generating multiple independent siRNAs, which simultaneously target different susceptible sites on HIV-1. Here, modified lhRNAs expressed from U6 RNA Pol III promoters were targeted to sites within the first transcribed sequences of the HIV-1 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) region. Both Tat-dependent and independent suppressive efficacy was demonstrated against subtype B and C reporter sequences; however, lhRNAs complementary to the TAR stem-loop were refractory to silencing. None of the lhRNAs induced an unwanted interferon response as measured by interferon beta levels. Silencing by the lhRNAs was not equal across the extent of its cognate sequence, with the greatest efficacy observed for sequences located at the base of the stem. Nevertheless, direct antireplicative activity was seen when targeting lhRNAs to a subtype B HIV clone pNL4-3 Luc and a subtype C wild-type HIV-1 strain, FV5. These data highlight distinct target loci within the 5' LTR of HIV-1 that are susceptible to lhRNA targeting, and may prove to have an important advantage over other RNAi target sites within HIV-1. Although lhRNAs themselves require further manipulation to improve their overall efficacy in generating multiple functioning siRNAs, they may prove useful in any combinatorial-based approach to treating HIV-1 infection."
1408,0.005,1.0000,"RNA virus population dynamics are complex, and sophisticated approaches are needed in many cases for therapeutic intervention. One such approach, termed lethal mutagenesis, is directed at targeting the virus population structure for extinction or error catastrophe. Previous studies have demonstrated the concept of this approach with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by use of chemical mutagens [i.e., 5-azacytidine (5-AZC)] as well as by host factors with mutagenic properties (i.e., APOBEC3G). In this study, these two unrelated mutagenic agents were used concomitantly to investigate the interplay of these distinct mutagenic mechanisms. Specifically, an HIV-1 was produced from APOBEC3G (A3G)-expressing cells and used to infect permissive target cells treated with 5-AZC. Reduced viral infectivity and increased viral mutagenesis were observed with both the viral mutagen (i.e., G-to-C mutations) and the host restriction factor (i.e., G-to-A mutations); however, when combined, they had complex interactions. Intriguingly, nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that concomitant HIV-1 exposure to both 5-AZC and A3G resulted in an increase in G-to-A viral mutagenesis at the expense of G-to-C mutagenesis. A3G catalytic activity was required for the diminution in G-to-C mutagenesis. Taken together, our findings provide the first demonstration for potentiation of the mutagenic effect of a cytosine analog by A3G expression, resulting in concomitant HIV-1 lethal mutagenesis."
1168,0.005,1.0000,"This study was aimed to evaluate TT virus prevalence in subjects with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in patients affected by hepatitis of unknown origin (non-A-non-E hepatitis) and in healthy subjects who had not been exposed to HBV, HCV and HIV. A total of 317 subjects were tested; 40 were HBsAg asymptomatic carriers, 57 subjects were anti-HCV positive (45 without chronic hepatitis and 12 with HCV-related chronic hepatitis), and 27 had chronic non-A-non-E hepatitis. Fifty-seven subjects were intravenous drug users (IVDUs) (52 with HCV or/and HIV infections), seven patients underwent a liver transplant for fulminant hepatitis and 137 were healthy subjects from the general population. Overall, TTV-DNA was detected in 62 subjects (19.6%): in 17.9% of the HBsAg carriers, in 14% of the anti-HCV-positive patients (in 8.3% and in 15.5% of patients with and without chronic hepatitis, respectively), in 22.2% of non-A-non-E hepatitis patients, in 22.8% of IVDUs, in 57.1% of fulminant hepatitis patients. TTV-DNA was also found in 20.4% healthy subjects. The prevalence in the different subgroups was not statistically different. The genotypes were identified in 40 of the 62 (64.5%) TTV-DNA positive samples: genotype 1a in 17.5%, 1b in 27.5%, genotype 2 in 27.5%, genotype 3 in 15.0%, genotype 4 in 5.0% and genotype 5 in 7.5%; the genotype distribution in the subsets of patients was not significantly different. In conclusion, this study showed that TTV infection is common in Italy; it is widespread throughout the entire population and five genotypes are present in Sardinia. Our results further dismiss the role of TTV as cofactor in influencing the clinical course of infections with other hepatitis viruses as well as the role of HIV in enhancing TTV transmission and replication."
9721,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence, genotypes, coinfection and putative core gene sequence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) were investigated in the inshore area of the Yangtze River, where hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is thought to be very common. Most patients with liver diseases were infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), but the incidence of anti-HCV was very low, being 3.4% in patients with acute hepatitis, and approximately 7% in those with chronic liver diseases. The rate of coinfection with HBV and HCV in patients with HCC was 4.5%, which was similar to that in Shanghai (5.6%), but lower than that in Yangzhou (31.2%), Beijing (26.8%) and Zhejiang (28.6%). Of 124 patients with non-A, non-B (NANB) liver disease, 15 (12.1%) were positive for anti-HCV. HCV genotype analysis in 41 HCV-RNA-positive patients with liver diseases showed that genotype II was dominant (85.4%), followed by genotype III (7.3%) and II+III (7.3%). No genotype I or IV was found. The genome sequences of the HCV putative core gene from two patients with chronic hepatitis were more closely similar to those of previous isolates from Japan and China, than to that of an American isolate. These results suggest that HCV infection is not an important etiological factor for liver diseases, and that the HCV isolates in China are from the same subgroup as those in Japan."
9162,0.005,1.0000,"We present health and demographic surveillance system data to assess associations with health care utilization and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) service receipt in a high HIV prevalence area of western Kenya. Eighty-six percent of 15,302 residents indicated a facility/clinician for routine medical services; 60% reported active (within the past year) attendance. Only 34% reported a previous HIV test, and self-reported HIV prevalence was 6%. Active attendees lived only slightly closer to their reported service site (2.8 versus 3.1 km; P < 0.001) compared with inactive attendees. Multivariate analysis showed that younger respondents (< 30 years of age) and active and inactive attendees were more likely to report an HIV test compared with non-attendees; men were less likely to report HIV testing. Despite traveling farther for HIV services (median distance = 4.4 km), 77% of those disclosing HIV infection reported HIV care enrollment. Men and younger respondents were less likely to enroll in HIV care. Socioeconomic status was not associated with HIV service use. Distance did not appear to be the major barrier to service receipt. The health and demographic surveillance system data identified patterns of service use that are useful for future program planning."
6473,0.005,1.0000,"Starting from the observation that a number of consecutive patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) resulted positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies on routine testing, we set up a survey for HCV contact prevalence in all patients with lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) followed in our institution. We searched for HCV antibodies by a third-generation ELISA technique, followed by a confirmation test (RIBA III); serum viral RNA and HCV genotype were investigated by a RT-PCR technique. We screened a total of 315 patients suffering from B-NHL (91), multiple myeloma (56), MGUS (48), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (57), Waldentrom's macroglobulinemia (13), Hodgkin's disease (HD)(43), and T-NHL (9). While only 1 of 52 patients with a non-B-LPD (HD or T-NHL) had signs of HCV contact (i.e., 1.9%, which is in the range of the normal population in the South of Italy), 59 of 263 patients with a B-LPD (22.4%) had HCV antibodies or RNA, or both, with no major differences among the various types of disorders, except for WM, in which the rate was higher (61.5%). The same prevalence was found for patients tested at diagnosis or during the follow-up, and in transfused or never-transfused patients. Only a few patients were aware of having a liver disease; one-half of HCV-positive patients never had transaminase increase. A review of data from Central and Northern Italy is included, showing similar findings; a report from Japan has confirmed such an association, while limited surveys in England have not revealed any correlation. These findings may have important biological and clinical implications."
1717,0.005,1.0000,"Albania is a Mediterranean country, still with a high endemicity level of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The chronic hepatitis B profile was characterized in this geographical area and used as a model to investigate the impact of endemicity level on the prevalence of the two major forms of chronic hepatitis B (HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B). A cross-sectional study was conducted among 62 chronic hepatitis B patients consecutively admitted to the most important tertiary health care center for the diagnosis and treatment of liver disease in Albania. HBV-DNA was measured with an in-house PCR with a sensitivity of 10(4) copies/ml which uses primers encompassing the pre-core/core region. PCR products were subjected to sequencing and oligohybridization assay. Of the 62 patients, 75.8% had HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B. Genotype D was found in all 39 patients with detectable HBV viremia, for whom the heterogeneity of the region modulating HBeAg expression was assessed. Basic core promoter (BCP) mutations (1762/1764) were observed more often in anti-HBe-positive and older patients. In more than 90% of the HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients with detectable viremia, HBV that carries the G to A pre-core mutation at nucleotide 1896 was found. Patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B were younger than HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients, and for symptomatic and asymptomatic liver-disease patients, the age of peak prevalence was at least 10 years lower for HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients. In conclusion, the virological and clinical pattern of chronic hepatitis B in Albania is similar to that observed in other Mediterranean countries; it seems to be independent of the HBV endemicity level."
7979,0.005,1.0000,"The significance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes for the heterogeneity of chronic HBV infection and severity of liver disease is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and virologic characteristics of HBV genotypes in China and possible association with the diversity of liver disease. The study includes 1096 chronic HBV carriers from nine provinces in China. We collected clinical and laboratory data and analysed the HBV strains in sera by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and nucleotide sequencing techniques. The most common HBV genotypes were B (41%) and C (53%), while genotypes A and D were also found. A North-South divide was identified in genotype B and C distribution - genotype C was predominant in northern China, while genotype B was more prevalent in southern provinces. Patients with genotype B were younger than those with genotype C, and had a lower prevalence of HBeAg - 65%vs 72%, respectively (P = 0.03). However, the severity of liver disease did not differ significantly between patients infected with genotype B or C - neither when comparing liver function tests (1024 patients), nor hepatic inflammation and fibrosis (264 patients). Amongst 47 patients with genotype D (by PCR-RFLP), 37 (79%) were infected with a new subtype (designated Dc), having a recombination fragment from genotype C precore/core region. This is the first large-scale HBV genotype study from China and convincing documentation of the North-to-South gradient of genotypes C vs B in this country. HBV DNA recombination over the surface and precore/core genes increases the diversity of HBV strains and may have diagnostic and clinical implications."

They were tested for serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), GBV-C/HGV RNA, anti-envelope protein 2 antibody (anti-E2) and TTV DNA. Direct sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed on 58 isolates for TTV genotype determination. The prevalence of TTV DNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA, anti-E2 and over all GBV-C/HGV exposure was 24.9, 3.4, 8.2 and 11.1%, respectively. Using uni- and multi-variate analyses, male gender and TTV viremia were associated significantly with raised ALT values. Sixty-nine percent of TTV isolates were deduced to be TTV genotype 1 and they had significantly lower mean age than genotype non-1 isolates. In the population, raised ALT may be related to male gender and be attributable to TTV infection but not to GBV-C/HGV among individuals with no evidence of current HBV and HCV infection. TTV genotype 1 is the most prevalent genotype and associated with younger age."

All newly diagnosed patients for HIV-infection from 2004 to 2013 at a reference medical care area in Northwest of Spain were identified. Epidemiological, virological, immunological, and clinical data, as well as HIV genotype and drug resistance information were recorded. A total of 565 newly HIV-diagnosed patients were identified. The number of new cases increased in the last 5 years (66‚Äâcases/year). Overall, 53.1% had a median CD4 counts‚Äâ<‚Äâ350‚Äâcells/¬µl and 33.6% had an AIDS defining criteria. Non-B variants were found in 34.4% of patients being subtype F (25.8%) the most common non-B subtype. The rate of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) over the study period was 3.7%, but a decreased to 2.6% was observed in the last 5 years. The most prevalent TDR mutations were: T215 revertants (1.5%), K219QENR (1.2%), for NRTIs; K103N (1.9%), for NNRTIs; L90M (0.3%), for PIs. Overall, 73.2% of patients started antiretroviral treatment and 9.9% of patients died during follow-up. The number of newly HIV diagnosed patients increased since year 2009. There is a high prevalence of late diagnosis (53%) and 33% had an AIDS defining criteria. Interestingly, the most prevalent non-B subtype in our population was F (25.8%). These findings support the need to facilitate the access for HIV testing to reduce the rate of late HIV diagnosis, improve the clinical outcome and prevent HIV transmission."

During a 13 months period 1977-1978 a total of 129 cases of acute viral hepatitis type B occurred among patients who were admitted with hepatitis to Roslagstull, Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Less than 1% progressed to chronicity. Prevalence of Delta superinfection was studied among 60 patients with chronic hepatitis B. Nineteen (32%) were anti-delta positive. The majority of the positive patients were either non-European immigrants or addicts, both 9/19 (47%). Infections with the delta agent was found to have occurred in Stockholm already in the early 1970s. Rate of HBeAg clearance during chronic HBV was studied among 36 HBeAg positive patients. Seroconversion to anti-HBe was noted in 17 patients (47%), whereas HBeAg persisted in 19 during a mean follow-up period of 53 months. The spontaneous annual HBeAg seroconversion rate was 11%. HBeAg clearance occurred as frequently among homosexual men as among patients in other categories. However, 12/14 homosexual men were HBeAg positive after 2 years follow-up, compared with 1/13 drug addicts. Thus, homosexual men seemed to require a longer time for HBeAg seroconversion than i.v. drug addicts. HBV-DNA in serum, a strong indicator of viral particles and infectivity was analysed among patients with HBeAg seroconversion, initial HBeAg negativity and/or delta superinfection. HBV-DNA was found in 75-80% of our HBeAg positive patients. A correlation between chronic liver disease and presence of HBV-DNA in serum was also found. Thus, HBV DNA was found in 63% of patients with CAH or CAH/CI as compared with only 39% of patients with CPH. Delta infected patients had HBV-DNA more often than those without hepatitis D infection. Seven delta infected, anti-HBe positive, patients were still HBV-DNA positive five to eight years later. Therefore delta infected anti-HBe positive patients can be infectious for prolonged periods. Histological outcome. 63% (12/19) anti-delta positive patients were classified as CAH with or without cirrhosis as against 39% (16/41) of the anti-delta negative patients. Eleven of 15 homosexual men (73%) had histological findings classified as CAH or CAH/CI. None of them were superinfected with HDV. Thus homosexual men developed severe hepatic lesions without being delta infected. In contrast 78% (7/9) i.v. drug addicts with CAH were delta infected. A numerical scoring system was applied and compared with conventional morphological classification of liver histology to assess the histological outcome of 42 patients with repetitive liver biopsies."
8899,0.005,1.0000,"Medication adherence is important for the success of nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC) treatment for chronic hepatitis B. The aims of this study were to determine adherence to NUCs and factors associated with NUC adherence and to correlate NUC adherence with the occurrence of virological breakthroughs in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving NUC were asked to complete a survey every 3 months. Adherence was also assessed by healthcare providers in the clinic. Adherence rate was defined as the per cent of days the patients took their hepatitis B virus medications during the last 30 days. A total of 111 patients were studied. The mean age was 47.7 years, 73.9% were men, 57.7% were Asian, 42.3% had postgraduate education and 80% had private insurance. Sixty-nine (74.1%) patients reported 100% adherence in the survey, while 78 (83.9%) reported 100% adherence to their healthcare providers. Patients with 100% adherence based on the survey were older (P = 0.02), more likely to be men (P = 0.006), and had higher annual household income (P = 0.04) than those with <100% adherence. In the 80 patients who completed three surveys, viral breakthrough was observed in 1/46 (2.2%) with 100% adherence on all three surveys, 1/18 (5.6%) with <100% adherence on one survey and 3/16 (18.8%) with <100% adherence on ‚â•2 surveys, (P = 0.06). In conclusion, adherence to NUC therapy in our patients with chronic hepatitis B was high but self-reporting of adherence to healthcare providers may be inflated. Patients with chronic hepatitis B with better adherence to NUC therapy had a trend towards a lower rate of viral breakthroughs."
1645,0.005,1.0000,"Repeated exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does not always result in seroconversion. Modifications in coreceptors for HIV entrance to target cells are one of the factors that block the infection. We studied the frequency of Delta-32 mutation in ccr5 gene in Medellin, Colombia. Two hundred and eighteen individuals distributed in three different groups were analyzed for Delta-32 mutation in ccr5 gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR): 29 HIV seropositive (SP), 39 exposed seronegative (ESN) and 150 individuals as a general population sample (GPS). The frequency of the Delta-32 mutant allele was 3.8% for ESN, 2.7% for GPS and 1.7% for SP. Only one homozygous mutant genotype (Delta-32/Delta-32) was found among the ESN (2.6%). The heterozygous genotype (ccr5/Delta-32) was found in eight GPS (5.3%), in one SP (3.4%) and in one ESN (2.6%). The differences in the allelic and genotypic frequencies among the three groups were not statistically significant. A comparison between the expected and the observed genotypic frequencies showed that these frequencies were significantly different for the ESN group, which indirectly suggests a protective effect of the mutant genotype (Delta-32/Delta-32). Since this mutant genotype explained the resistance of infection in only one of our ESN persons, different mechanisms of protection must be playing a more important role in this population."

In multivariate analysis, HIV infection was independently associated with crack use and with being gay or bisexual. In New York City, HIV prevention for drug users has focused on syringe access, safe injection, and drug user treatment, but further progress in HIV control will require strategies to address sexual health among people who use drugs.

We established the use of tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) for detecting IL28B rs8099917 genotype (T>G) in 56 Chinese chronic hepatitis C patients infected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1. The new assay showed 98.2% specificity, and was confirmed by direct sequencing. Among the 56 samples, TT genotype and TG genotype accounted for 80.4% (45/56) and 19.6% (11/56), respectively. GG genotype was not found. The proportion of responders in TT group was higher than that in TG group (68.9% vs. 27.3%, p=0.029). For HCV clinical decision-making, using the new assay, rs8099917 genotyping could provide similar information to rs12979860 genotyping due to a strong association between the two SNPs in Chinese patients. The assay system in this study can be implemented using basic laboratory equipments, making it convenient for clinical and research purposes."

However, development of ARV resistance in these children is a major public health problem due to lack of availability of and access to new drugs. This study was conducted in order to identify circulating HIV subtypes and recombinant forms and evaluate the drug resistance mutation patterns in 18 HIV-1 infected children failing ARV treatment in Kelantan, Malaysia. Genotyping for codon 1-99 of protease (PR) and 1-250 of reverse transcriptase (RT) were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing. Subsequently, these were phylogenetically analyzed to determine the subtypes. CRF33_01B (44.4%) was found to be the predominant HIV subtype, followed by B (27.8%), CRF15_01B (16.7%) and CRF01_AE (11.1%) subtypes. The most prevalent RT mutations were T215F/V/Y (66.7%), D67G/N (55.6%), K219Q/E/R (44.4%), M184V/I (38.9%), K70R/E (27.8%) and M41L (27.8%), associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) resistance; and K103N (55.6%), G190A (33.3%), and K101P/E/H (27.8%) associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) resistance. The results showed a possible emergence of CRF33_01B as current predominant subtypes/circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), and a high frequency of primary mutations among HIV-1 infected children after failure of ARV therapy in Kelantan, Malaysia."
5109,0.005,1.0000,"The dynamics of emerging nucleoside and nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance in hepatitis B virus (HBV) are not well understood because standard dideoxynucleotide direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing assays detect drug-resistance mutations only after they have become dominant. To obtain insight into NRTI resistance, we used a new sequencing technology to characterize the spectrum of low-prevalence NRTI-resistance mutations in HBV obtained from 20 plasma samples from 11 NRTI-treated patients and 17 plasma samples from 17 NRTI-naive patients, by using standard direct PCR sequencing and ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS). UDPS detected drug-resistance mutations that were not detected by PCR in 10 samples from 5 NRTI-treated patients, including the lamivudine-resistance mutation V173L (in 5 samples), the entecavir-resistance mutations T184S (in 2 samples) and S202G (in 1 sample), the adefovir-resistance mutation N236T (in 1 sample), and the lamivudine and adefovir-resistance mutations V173L, L180M, A181T, and M204V (in 1 sample). G-to-A hypermutation mediated by the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like family of cytidine deaminases was estimated to be present in 0.6% of reverse-transcriptase genes. Genotype A coinfection was detected by UDPS in each of 3 patients in whom genotype G virus was detected by direct PCR sequencing. UDPS detected low-prevalence HBV variants with NRTI-resistance mutations, G-to-A hypermutation, and low-level dual genotype infection with a sensitivity not previously possible."

These patients received T20 plus an antiretroviral regimen and were followed-up over a period of 40-72 weeks. In one non-responder patient, N43D substitution was detected at 12 weeks of treatment, in association with a value of T20-IC50 of 10 microg/ml (10-fold increase). Double mutations N42T + N43D were observed in plasma RNA at 32 weeks and remained detectable up to 16 weeks after the withdrawal of the drug. The S138A substitution in HR2 was observed in plasma RNA at 32 weeks, and both in plasma RNA and in PI DNA at 40 weeks, associated with an increase of the T20-IC50 to 25 microg/ml (25-fold increase). Mutations V101G and E137K, not reported previously, were also observed in the HR2 region. Whether these new substitutions play a role in T20 resistance needs to be examined. In three temporary responders, coinciding with viral load rebound, G36D, and N42T substitutions were observed at 12, 24, and 40 weeks. G36D mutation was associated with a value of T20-IC50 of 5 microg/ml. The HR2 S138A mutation was detected after the detection of HR1 substitutions and was associated with an increase in the level of T20-IC50 to 125 microg/ml (125-fold increase) All these data reinforce the role of gp41 amino acids 36-45 and the potential influence of the HR2 S138A mutation in the genotypic/phenotypic resistance to T20."

Later in the time course, productive HIV-1 infection broke through at high initial infective doses. However, at initial multiplicities of infection equal to or smaller than 0.1, HIV-1 production was not detectable during the 5 weeks of observation.

3566,0.005,1.0000,"In 1994, the US Public Health Service published guidelines for the use of zidovudine to decrease the risk of perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1995, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the US Public Health Service recommended documented, routine HIV education and testing with consent for all pregnant women in the United States. Widespread incorporation of these guidelines into clinical practice has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the rate of perinatal HIV transmission and has contributed to more than a 75% decrease in reported cases of pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) since 1992. Substantial advances have been made in the treatment and monitoring of HIV infection; combination antiretroviral regimens that maximally suppress virus replication are now available. These regimens are recommended for pregnant and nonpregnant individuals who require treatment. Risk factors associated with perinatal HIV transmission are now better understood, and recent results from trials to decrease the rate of mother-to-child HIV transmission have contributed new strategies with established efficacy. However, perinatal HIV transmission still occurs; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 300 to 400 infected infants are born annually. Full implementation of recommendations for universal, routine prenatal HIV testing and evaluation of missed prevention opportunities will be critical to further decrease the incidence of pediatric HIV infection in the United States. This technical report summarizes recent advances in the prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV relevant to screening of pregnant women and their infants."
8093,0.005,1.0000,"We have been studying the role of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) as a potential cofactor in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related disease. The clinical relevance of HCMV is highlighted by the fact that it is a principal viral pathogen in patients with AIDS and is known to infect the same cells as HIV. In this study, we focused on the molecular interactions between HIV and HCMV in human fibroblasts and in the human glioblastoma/astrocytoma-derived cell line U373 MG, cells which can be productively infected by both viruses. Because these cells are CD4-, we used HIV pseudotyped with a murine amphotropic retrovirus as described previously (D. H. Spector, E. Wade, D. A. Wright, V. Koval, C. Clark, D. Jaquish, and S. A. Spector, J. Virol. 64:2298-2308, 1990). Initial studies showed that when cells were preinfected with HIV (Ampho-1B) for 5 days and then superinfected with HCMV, HIV antigen production dropped significantly in the coinfected cells but continued to rise in cells infected with HIV (Ampho-1B) alone. HCMV production, however, was unaffected by the presence of HIV. Further analysis showed that HIV steady-state RNA levels and gag and env protein production were also inhibited in the presence of HCMV. The transcriptional inhibition of HIV was particularly surprising in view of the previous results of several other laboratories as well as our own that HCMV infection stimulates HIV long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (LTR-CAT) expression in transient expression assays. To investigate this further, we transfected the HIV LTR-CAT construct into either uninfected cells or cells which had been preinfected with HIV. The cells were infected with HCMV 24 h posttransfection and assayed for CAT gene expression at 48 h after HCMV infection. Although there was some stimulation of the LTR-CAT in cells that were dually infected by HIV and HCMV, it was 16-fold less than that in the cells infected only with HCMV. This suggests that in the presence of the HIV infection, the stimulation of the HIV LTR-CAT gene by HCMV is significantly reduced. Experiments with UV-irradiated HCMV and the HCMV DNA polymerase inhibitor ganciclovir showed that HCMV transcription is necessary for the reduction in HIV production to occur; however, replication of the HCMV genome or any events which take place after DNA replication are not necessary. These results, coupled with the observation that inhibition is usually first seen between 8 and 24 h after HCMV infection, suggest that an HCMV early protein is involved in repression of HIV."
5770,0.005,1.0000,"The first HIV-infected patients were treated in 1986, however, at that time medicines inhibiting HIV replication were not available. Solely the complications of AIDS and opportunistic infections could be treated. The HIV replication inhibition capacity of antiretroviral nucleoside and ribavirin were tested in Hungary in 1987, an early date even in international practice. The first nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), azidothymidine, presently called zidovudine (ZDV), was introduced in 1989. By giving patients the appropriate dosage of this, the progression of the disease could be delayed by approximately 6 months to one year. In 1991, the application of two new NRTI was commenced, namely zalcitabine (DDC) and didanosine (DDI). These medicines were applied partly in case of ZDV intolerance and as a part of the sequential monotherapy. In 1994 and 1995 two new NRTI's were introduce, namely stavudine (d4T) and lamivudine (3 TC). At that same time, to obtain a more effective replication inhibition method, a double NRTI combination became part of the therapeutic protocol. The year 1996 resulted in significant changes. At the beginning of the year, two compounds belonging to two new therapeutic procedures. These are saquinavir (SQV) and delavirdine (DLV) belonging to the groups of protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase, respectively. The so-called virus cocktails and the effective active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were applied and, later, to monitor the efficiency of the treatment, the opportunity was provided to measure the copy number of HIV-RNS. The treatment of the HIV disease entails a number of unanswered questions. The maximum result that can be achieved by using today's therapeutic methods is to prolong that particular phase of the HIV disease, which secures the patient a fairly good quality of life. The new combination of the antiretroviral compounds produced by the pharmaceutical industry provides better changes to prolong said period by years, sometimes decades. However, the real solutions to the problem are only theoretically known treatment procedures (gene therapy, cytokins) today."
753,0.005,1.0000,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) was first isolated in 1987 from a cat with an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-like disease. Since then, FIV has been subject of intensive research. Perturbation in cytokine production observed in human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) is paralleled in the FIV-infected cat. Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is a type 1 lymphokine that exert protective effects during infection through upregulation of cellular immunity and phagocytic functions. The present study was carried out to examine the expression of IFN-gamma in a feline T-lymphoid cell line (Fel-039) infected with FIV as well as the viral replication in these cells after addition of recombinant-type feline IFN (rIFn). We found a marked inhibition of IFN-gamma release in Fel-039 cells infected with FIV which might be pivotal for high viral replication. Infection of Fel-039 cells with FIV resulted in an increase of the reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in the culture supernatant. When the cells were cultured in the presence of rIFN a significant dose-dependent inhibition of RT activity of FIV was detected without cytotoxicity. On the basis of these in vitro results, we suggest that IFN therapies aimed at restoring depleted level of this important cytokine in FIV infected T-cells make this compound a promising candidate for development of suitable drugs for AIDS treatment."
6694,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family of enveloped DNA viruses. It was previously shown that HBV can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activate the IRE1-XBP1 pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR), through the expression of the viral regulatory protein X (HBx). However, it remained obscure whether or not this activation had any functional consequences on the target genes of the UPR pathway. Of these targets, the ER degradation-enhancing, mannosidase-like proteins (EDEMs) are thought to play an important role in relieving the ER stress during UPR, by recognizing terminally misfolded glycoproteins and delivering them to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In this study, we investigated the role of EDEMs in the HBV life-cycle. We found that synthesis of EDEMs (EDEM1 and its homologues, EDEM2 and EDEM3) is significantly up-regulated in cells with persistent or transient HBV replication. Co-expression of the wild-type HBV envelope proteins with EDEM1 resulted in their massive degradation, a process reversed by EDEM1 silencing. Surprisingly, the autophagy/lysosomes, rather than the proteasome were involved in disposal of the HBV envelope proteins. Importantly, inhibition of the endogenous EDEM1 expression in HBV replicating cells significantly increased secretion of both, enveloped virus and subviral particles. This is the first report showing that HBV activates the ERAD pathway, which, in turn, reduces the amount of envelope proteins, possibly as a mechanism to control the level of virus particles in infected cells and facilitate the establishment of chronic infections."
3641,0.005,1.0000,"Latent and productive viral infections are at the extremes of the spectrum of virus-cell interactions that are thought to play a major role in the ability of such important human pathogens as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to elude host defenses and cause disease. The recent development of PCR-based methods to amplify target sequences in individual cells in routinely fixed tissues affords opportunities to directly examine the subtle and covert virus-cell relationships at the latent end of the spectrum that are inaccessible to analysis by conventional in situ hybridization techniques. We have now used PCR in situ with in situ hybridization to document latent and permissive HIV infection in routinely fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue. In one of the first specimens we examined, a tumor biopsy from an HIV-infected individual, we found many of the lymphocytes and lymphocytes infiltrating the tumor had HIV DNA that was detectable only by PCR in situ. The fraction of positive cells varied regionally, but there were foci where most of the cells contained HIV DNA. Most of these lymphocytes and macrophages are latently infected, as we could detect HIV RNA in fewer than one in a thousand of these cells. We also detected HIV RNA, surprisingly, in 6% of the tumor cells, where the number of copies of viral RNA per cell was equivalent to productively infected cell lines. The alternative states of HIV-gene expression and high local concentration of latently infected lymphocytes and monocytes revealed by these studies conceptually supports models of lentiviral pathogenesis that attribute persistence to the reservoir of latently infected cells and disease to the consequences of viral-gene expression in this population. The magnitude of infection of lymphocytes documented in this report is also consistent with the emerging view that HIV infection per se could contribute substantially to depletion of immune cells in AIDS."
469,0.005,1.0000,"The implementation of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening tests has significantly enhanced blood transfusion safety. However, the transmission of HBsAg-negative blood components can still occur in the acute phase of infection during the seronegative window period or during chronic stages of infection such as occult hepatitis virus B infection (OBI). OBI, characterized by the presence of HBV infection without detectable HBsAg, is capable to elude the routine detection with HBV serologic markers and harbor a potential risk of HBV transmission through blood transfusion or organ transplantation. Here, we test the hypothesis that OBI patients have a differentially expressed profile of microRNA (miRNA) in serum, and this unique serum miRNA signature can serve as a biomarker to detect OBI. Employing TaqMan probe-based quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we assessed the expression level of miRNAs in serum samples. To control for miRNA quantitation, we added an exogenous plant miRNA, MIR156a, into the samples before RNA extraction and used it as an internal control. After screening 13 previously identified HBV-specific serum miRNAs, we obtained four miRNAs, let-7c, miR-23b, miR-122, and miR-150, which are differentially expressed in OBI sera compared to healthy control sera. This 4-serum miRNA signature shows a high level of accuracy in discriminating both OBI (AUC¬†=¬†0.999) and HBV (AUC¬†=¬†0.989) cases from the non-infected controls. Cluster analysis also demonstrates that this 4-miRNA signature can clearly separate OBI patients from the control group. Our results demonstrate for the first time that a profile of serum miRNAs can serve as a sensitive and accurate biomarker for OBI detection."
1772,0.005,1.0000,"Tat is a protein that dramatically increases the expression of all genes expressed from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat through interaction with a cis-acting target sequence referred to as TAR (for trans-acting responsive region). The tat gene is divided into two coding exons which, when translated, result in the synthesis of an 86-amino-acid protein. However, the 72-amino-acid segment encoded by the first coding exon of tat is sufficient to encode a fully active Tat protein in known assays. We examined expression of the env gene from an LTR that lacks TAR (designated dTAR-env). Surprisingly, only the full-length Tat peptide trans activated expression of the env gene from dTAR-env. Comparison of RNA and protein expression of the env gene in the presence of Tat indicated that the mechanism of trans activation is posttranscriptional rather than transcriptional. To test whether the TAR-independent Tat function is specific to the HIV-1 env gene, we analyzed expression of heterologous genes from the long terminal repeat lacking TAR. These heterologous genes were not trans activated by Tat in the absence of a TAR element, which suggests that the second-exon peptide of Tat has a sequence-specific role in TAR-independent trans activation of the HIV-1 env gene. Analysis of a mutant in the 5' end of the env gene was used to identify a cis-acting sequence required for Tat responsiveness."
1681,0.005,1.0000,"Enfuvirtide is the first of a new class of antiretroviral drugs that inhibits HIV entry. It is a 36 amino acid synthetic peptide that mimics the HR2 region of the HIV-1 gp41, preventing the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Up to now, enfuvirtide was designed based on the HIV-1 B-subtype gp41, and resistance mutations to the fusion inhibitor have been investigated primarily in individuals infected with this subtype. To fill the gap, we analyzed the full length gp41 protein sequence of HIV-1 non-B strains from individuals receiving enfuvirtide-containing regimens. No primary resistance to the enfuvirtide binding domain (36-45 residues) was found. Resistance mutations were detected at follow-up visits and were comparable to those described among B-subtype HIV-1-infected patients; no sequence changes were detected in crucial HR1/HR2 gp41 sites such as the cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope, cysteine loop, ectodomain, and 5-helix interaction and binding region."
6353,0.005,1.0000,"Because immunologic classification of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) might be more relevant than genotypic classification for designing polyvalent vaccines, studies were undertaken to determine whether immunologically defined groups of HIV (""immunotypes"") could be identified. For these experiments, the V3 region of the 120-kDa envelope glycoprotein (gp120) was chosen for study. Although antibodies (Abs) to V3 may not play a major protective role in preventing HIV infection, identification of a limited number of immunologically defined structures in this extremely variable region would set a precedent supporting the hypothesis that, despite its diversity, the HIV family, like the V3 region, might be divisible into immunotypes. Consequently, the immunochemical reactivities of 1,176 combinations of human anti-V3 monoclonal Abs (MAbs) and V3 peptides, derived from viruses of several clades, were studied. Extensive cross-clade reactivity was observed. The patterns of reactivities of 21 MAbs with 50 peptides from clades A through H were then analyzed by a multivariate statistical technique. To test the validity of the mathematical approach, a cluster analysis of the 21 MAbs was performed. Five groups were identified, and these MAb clusters corresponded to classifications of these same MAbs based on the epitopes which they recognize. The concordance between the MAb clusters identified by mathematical analysis and by their specificities supports the validity of the mathematical approach. Therefore, the same mathematical technique was used to identify clusters within the 50 peptides. Seven groups of peptides, each containing peptides from more than one clade, were defined. Inspection of the amino acid sequences of the peptides in each of the mathematically defined peptide clusters revealed unique ""signature sequences"" that suggest structural motifs characteristic of each V3-based immunotype. The results suggest that cluster analysis of immunologic data can define immunotypes of HIV. These immunotypes are distinct from genotypic classifications. The methods described pave the way for identification of immunotypes defined by immunochemical and neutralization data generated with anti-HIV Env MAbs and intact, viable HIV virions."
8854,0.005,1.0000,"Although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been a major global health problem for almost 3 decades, with the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996 and effective prophylaxis and management of opportunistic infections, mortality from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has decreased markedly. In developed countries, this condition is now being treated as a chronic condition. As a result, rates of morbidity and mortality from other medical conditions leading to end-stage liver, kidney, and heart disease are steadily increasing in individuals with HIV. Because the definitive treatment for end-stage organ failure is transplantation, the demand for it has increased among HIV-infected patients. For these reasons, many transplant centers have eliminated HIV infection as a contraindication to transplantation, as a result of better patient management and demand."
3250,0.005,1.0000,"The transmission of infectious diseases, mainly hepatitis B, non-A non-B and HIV infection, was the major complication of replacement therapy in hemophiliacs before the introduction of virus inactivated concentrates. The clinical relevance of transfusion associated infections in 43 hemophiliacs treated with different coagulation preparations during an observation period from 1978 to 1986, is discussed. Up to 1981, 38 hemophiliacs have shown hepatitis B seroconversion; 20 of them had a permanent increase in ALT levels. Only two among the five seronegative hemophiliacs showed an immune response to vaccination against hepatitis B. During the observation period 13 hemophiliacs contracted clinical non-A non-B hepatitis. Ten hemophiliacs have been HIV infected. Both hepatitis B and HIV infection occurred more frequently in hemophiliacs treated with foreign concentrates. One patient died of liver cirrhosis, another of AIDS. Since 1986. Swiss hemophiliacs have only been treated with virus inactivated concentrates: therefore no further HIV infections or hepatitis have been observed. Different methods of virus inactivation and factor VIIC purification are discussed. Since factor VIII yield is very low in the ultrapure and virusfree concentrates, a worldwide shortage of factor VIII concentrates is going on. It remains to be expected whether the availability of recombinant factor VIIIC will resolve these problems in the near future."
1928,0.005,1.0000,"The primary causes of morbidity and mortality in persons infected with the human immunodoficiency virus are oportunistic infections. Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) induces progressive quantitative and qualitative defects in CD4 (T helper) lymphocytes. Macrophage and monocyte function may also be impaired as a result of HIV infection. Consequently, patients in the later stages of HIV infection (ARC and AIDS) frequently experiency infections against which either cellular od humoral immunity, or both, are important. A large number of viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa are capable of infecting persons with ARC or AIDS. Much of recent research efforts has been targeted at new techniques to diagnose, treat and to prevent certain opportunistic infections. Treatment is often long and ardous for both patient and physician. This review provides a practical introduction to the treatment and prevention (primary prophylaxis, secondary prophylaxis, supression, or maintenance therapy) of the most common opportunistic infections associated with HIV."
3476,0.005,1.0000,"Enfuvirtide (ENF) prevents the entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) into cells by binding to the HR-1 region of the viral envelope (Env) protein gp41 subunit. Resistance to ENF arises via mutations in the drug binding site in HR-1. In addition, HR-2 mutations are commonly observed in ENF-resistant Env proteins, though their role remains unclear. We explored the mechanistic basis for clinical resistance to ENF and the role of HR-2 mutations. Using panels of ENF resistance-associated mutants for two patients, we found that mutations in HR-1 slowed the fusion kinetics and that mutations in HR-2 restored fusion rates. We assessed the differences in the rates of fusion of these mutants from a temperature-arrested state and observed similar trends, suggesting that the step of delay occurs after coreceptor engagement. Sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies was unchanged by the HR-1 and HR-2 mutants in each panel. Since this result was in contrast to those of a previous in vitro analysis where enhanced sensitivity to neutralization was demonstrated for heterologous Envs with ENF resistance-associated HR-1 changes, we examined the context dependence of HR-1 and HR-2 mutations by transferring the mutations seen in one patient into the Env context of another. These studies revealed that some, but not all, HR-1 mutations, when placed out of context (i.e., in a patient Env where they did not originally arise), enhance sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. However, in most cases, HR-1 mutations in ENF-treated patients evolve in a manner that preserves pretreatment neutralization sensitivity so as to evade the pressures of the immune system."
1330,0.005,1.0000,"Tenofovir is a nucleotide acting both as an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency (HIV) reverse transcriptase and as a competitor for hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA-directed DNA polymerase. Approved worldwide in 2001, tenofovir is used as a component of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients with HIV infection. Since 2008, it has also been indicated for treatment of chronic HBV infection or HIV/HBV co-infection. The aim of the treatment consists in suppressing viral replication, thus reducing hepatic complications and improving patient survival. Furthermore, tenofovir could represent an effective therapeutic option in lamivudine-resistant HBV patients. Tenofovir is eliminated unchanged through urine via glomerular filtration (80%) and proximal tubular secretion (20%). Thus, alterations in renal clearance may interfere with tenofovir pharmacokinetics and systemic drug concentrations, modifying the therapeutic response. Hence, a renal overload of tenofovir in patients with a pre-existing kidney impairment could result in a worsening of renal function. Following a brief introduction on HBV infection and its therapeutic options, we review the latest evidence, to our knowledge, on renal toxicity of tenofovir in HBV patients and on drug management."
4193,0.005,1.0000,"The most common first-line, highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) received by individuals infected with HIV-1 in Cameroon is the combination therapy Triomune, comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI). To examine the efficacy of these drugs in Cameroon, where diverse non-B HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses predominate, the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral sequences in patient plasma were analyzed for the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance. Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-na√Øve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-na√Øve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-na√Øve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon."
7202,0.005,1.0000,"Directly addressing HIV medication adherence and substance use together is ideal in light of the research on the complex connections between these two behaviors. This paper describes the development of a pilot program in which a combined motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy intervention was used to increase adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and reduce substance use in HIV-infected adults. The main goals of the pilot study were (1) to confirm the ability to recruit HIV-positive substance users taking HAART; (2) to demonstrate the ability to retain participants over the course of an eight-session intervention; and (3) to examine changes in substance use and HAART adherence from pretreatment to posttreatment. Twelve HIV-positive adults with a substance use disorder participated in an 8-week intervention, which consisted of weekly individual sessions with a trained therapist. Results showed that despite the small sample size, there was a significant reduction in substance use from pretreatment to posttreatment. No statistically significant differences were found for changes in HIV medication adherence, but the trends suggest the potential for positive results with a larger sample. Retention for all eight sessions of the treatment was 73.3%. Eighty percent completed the 3-month follow-up assessment. Participants reported high therapeutic alliance reflecting comfort with their therapists and in the treatment. Overall, the pilot demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the treatment. Furthermore, results suggest that this may, in fact, be an effective intervention to reduce substance use and improve HIV medication adherence."
8586,0.005,1.0000,"We studied the relation between the occurrence of adverse reactions to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) prophylaxis and the subsequent course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a cohort of homosexual men. Adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ were associated with a more rapid progression to AIDS (P < .001) and death (P < .001) and with a more rapid decline in CD4+ cell counts (P = .001). The median time to progression to AIDS was 14.9 months in subjects with adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ and 32.5 months in those without adverse reactions. After exclusion of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis from the case definition of AIDS, the differences in the rate of progression to AIDS between subjects with and without adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ were still highly significant (P = .004). A low CD4+ cell count at baseline and the use of antiretroviral agents before the start of prophylaxis were predictors of adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ but did not account for the difference in progression to AIDS between subjects with and without adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ. In a univariate analysis, the relative hazard of adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ for progression to AIDS was 2.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-4.28); in a multivariate analysis, it was 2.21 (95% CI, 1.29-3.81). The relative hazards of adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ for progression to AIDS with the exclusion of PCP and toxoplasmosis, CD4+ cell counts of <50/mm3, and death were 2.16 (95% CI, 1.25-3.72), 2.37 (95% CI, 1.36-4.12), and 3.21 (95% CI, 1.80-5.72), respectively. It is unclear whether adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ induce or merely predict progression of HIV disease."
2138,0.005,1.0000,"Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are a special group with growing interest. In order to study the epidemiological data of HIV+ patients on RRT in Spain, we collected individual information from 2004-2011 (period of use of highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART] in the Autonomous Communities of Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, Catalonia, Valencia, Castilla la Mancha, Castilla Le√≥n, Galicia, Madrid, La Rioja and the Basque Country, comprising 85% of the Spanish population. A total of 271 incident and 209 prevalent patients were analysed. They were compared with the remaining patients on RRT during the same period. The annual incidence was 0.8 patients per one million inhabitants, with a significant increase during the follow-up period. The proportion of prevalent HIV+ patients was 5.1 per 1,000 patients on RRT (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4-5.8. Although glomerular diseases constituted the majority of cases (42%), diabetic nephropathy was the cause in 14% of patients. The nation-wide totals for these percentages were 13 and 25%, respectively. Compared to the total of patients in treatment, the risk of death was significantly higher in the HIV+ group: hazard ratio (HR) adjusted for age, sex and diabetes was 2.26 (95% CI 1.74 - 2.91). Hepatitis C coinfection increased the risk of death in the HIV+ group (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.10 - 2.85). The probability of kidney transplantation in HIV+ was only 17% after 7 years, comparing with total RTT patients (HR 0.15; 95% CI: 0.10-0.24). Despite the use of HAART, the incidence of HIV+ patients on dialysis has increased; their mortality still exceeds non-HIV patients, and they have a very low rate of transplantation. It is necessary to further our knowledge of this disease in order to improve results. "
4542,0.005,1.0000,"One hundred sequences of HIV-1 protease with the two flanking cleavage sites from 10 antiretroviral drug-treated Thai patients were examined for residue variability and for mutations at positions associated with the resistance to protease inhibitors. Seven patients were infected with CRF01_AE, two with subtype B, and one with a strain that did not belong to any of the currently identified subtypes or recombinant forms. A total of 46 out of the 99 positions (46%) in HIV-1 protease showed at least one amino acid change as compared with the HXB2 subtype B protease. Interestingly, 35% of these mutations were at positions associated with resistance to the PIs. The observation indicated that the viral protease is flexible in tolerating some degree of amino acid substitutions even in the critical regions under the selective pressure driven by antiretroviral drugs. The PR/RT cleavage site revealed conservation of the HXB2 sequence. Nevertheless, the p6*/PR cleavage site displayed variability, notably in the p6* region."
9016,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) gene sequences obtained during antiretroviral resistance testing with a commercial genotyping assay (Tru Gene; Bayer Corp.) were analyzed to assess the utility of these data for detecting and characterizing non-subtype-B HIV-1 strains. A total of 125 viral sequences obtained from patients believed to have acquired their HIV-1 infection in Africa were analyzed, of which 121 were determined to belong to non-B subtypes. Utilizing Tru Gene sequence data alone, 92 (76%) of these viruses could be subtyped by conventional phylogenetic analysis. The addition of supplemental RT sequence data enabled a further 28 (23.1%) viruses to be classified, while one (0.9%) sample could not be classified conclusively. Two internet-accessible databases that generate HIV-1 subtypes from PR and RT sequences (HIV-SEQ and Geno 2 Pheno) were also evaluated, and both achieved 88% concordance (106/120) with phylogenetic analysis. Non-subtype-B and B-subtype HIV-1 sequences could be readily discriminated by tallying silent polymorphisms listed on the Tru Gene research report. The mean number of silent polymorphisms in the non-B HIV-1 sequences identified in this study was 58.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.1 to 75.5), compared with 20.7 (95% CI, 9.9 to 31.5) for the four subtype B viruses in the study cohort and 118 case-matched B-subtype controls. Sequence data generated in the Tru Gene HIV-1 genotyping assay could, therefore, provide a ready means of tracking the prevalence and identity of non-B subtypes in HIV-1-infected populations undergoing routine antiretroviral resistance testing."
199,0.005,1.0000,"The term 'genotyping' describes the genetic characterization of a genome. The genotype analysis is performed to identify mutations that differentiate one individual or strain from another. The mutations may confer resistance to specific antiviral drugs or they may simply allow classification of a strain as to 'type' and 'subtype'. There are four human viruses for which genotype information is clinically useful. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are being treated with antiretroviral drugs and resistance after prolonged treatment is common. Since HBV cannot be cultured, the only method of detecting resistance-conferring mutations in the genome is a genotypic analysis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be cured by treatment with the combination of interferon and ribavirin but certain strains of virus are more resistant to treatment than others. The current recommendations are that all HCV type 1 infections be treated for 12 months whereas other types may be successfully treated in 6 months. Since interferon treatment may have significant side effects, the determination of HCV genotype is an important aspect of this therapeutic regimen. Treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease with nucleoside analogues occasionally results in resistant virus with mutations in the phosphotransferase gene (UL97) and/or the DNA polymerase gene (UL54) that can be tested with phenotypic or genotypic assays. Since CMV grows very slowly, it may be more clinically useful to perform a rapid genotypic assay although only the UL97 gene can be efficiently genotyped. Finally, the virus for which genotyping has become the standard of care, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can now be genotyped routinely by many clinical virology labs experienced with molecular amplification methods and automated DNA sequencing technology. All currently-available antiretroviral drugs are directed against either the protease or reverse transcriptase genes of HIV-1 and the mutations within these genes that confer resistance have been well described. Sequence-based genotyping methods are not necessarily the best approach for routine genotyping of these four viruses, but sequencing is the gold standard from which other methods are developed and against which they are compared."
1148,0.005,1.0000,"Novel derivatives of the potent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor TSAO-T have been designed, synthesized and tested for their in vitro antiretroviral activity against HIV. These TSAO-T derivatives have been designed as potential bidentate inhibitors of HIV-1 RT, which combine in their structure the functionality of a non-nucleoside RT inhibitor (TSAO-T) and a bivalent ion-chelating moiety (a beta-diketone moiety) linked through an appropriate spacer to the N-3 of thymine of TSAO-T. Some of the new compounds have an anti-HIV-1 activity comparable to that of the parent compound TSAO-T, but display a markedly increased antiviral selectivity. There was a clear relationship between antiviral activity and the length of the spacer group that links the TSAO molecule with the chelating moiety. A shorter spacer invariably resulted in increased antiviral potency. None of the TSAO-T derivatives were endowed with anti-HIV-2 activity."
4731,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy has greatly reduced AIDS-related morbidity and mortality; however, its widespread use has been associated with a marked rise in the frequency of cardiovascular diseases in patients with HIV. Moreover, HIV infection is associated with accelerated coronary atherosclerosis and vasculopathy, although the mechanisms underlying these findings have not been determined. We describe the case of a 45-year-old woman with HIV/HCV coinfection, irritable bowel syndrome, and accelerated progression of coronary atherosclerosis after execution of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this case, the rapidity of progression of atherosclerosis seems linked principally to chronic inflammation and excess immune activation that can depend by a concourse of factors (chronic C hepatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, PCI execution) not directly associated with traditional risk factors. Caregivers following HIV-infected patients should be aware of the increased risk of accelerated atherogenesis in these subjects, principally in case of presence of causes of intense immune activation."
3939,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reverse transcriptase (RT) is encoded by the polymerase gene in the reverse transcriptase region, which overlaps with the S gene. The association between mutations of HBV RT and the pathobiological features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain to be elucidated. The present study aimed to examine mutations in this region of the HBV genome and its clinical significance. Briefly, HBV total DNA was extracted from 84 pairs of HCC tumor tissue and corresponding adjacent non‚Äëtumor tissue samples. The RT/S regions (nt130‚Äë1161) were amplified and sequenced using the Sanger method, and associations between RT mutations and the clinical characteristics of patients with HCC were analyzed. Finally, 27 and 29 mutations with frequencies >5% were identified in the RT and S regions, respectively. The rtF221Y variation and a tumor size >8¬†cm were found to be independent risk factors for the postoperative recurrence of HCC, with hazard ratios of 2.345 (95% CI, 1.391‚Äë3.953; P=0.001) and 1.838 (95% CI, 1.069‚Äë3.161; P=0.028), respectively. rtF221Y was also an independent risk factor for poor overall survival rates (HR=2.557; 95% CI, 1.344‚Äë4.866; P=0.004). The mutation of R122¬†K in the HBV S protein was closely associated with tumor recurrence (P<0.001). As a result, rtF221Y was identified as a risk factor for poor prognosis and may be a potential viral marker for predicting prognosis in HCC."
1200,0.005,1.0000,"Since the first case of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was reported in 1981, AIDS, as the global disease affecting 33.2 million people in 2007, has always been an unsolved problem worldwide. Reverse transcriptase (RT) is a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and thereby has been the prime drugs target for antiretroviral (ARV) therapy against AIDS. To date, two classes of RT inhibitors (RTIs), e.g., nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and a lot of compounds tested as RTIs have been described. To our knowledge, bis(heteroaryl)piperazines (BHAPs) have been considered as one class of promising NNRTIs, such as structurally and chemically related NNRTI delavirdine, which was approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in 1997. In this mini-review, we make attempts to report the progress of synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of BHAPs, in the meantime, the synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 replication by combining delavirdine with other HIV-1 inhibitors is also discussed. It will pave the way for the design and development of BHAPs as anti-HIV-1 agents in AIDS chemotherapy in the future."
8377,0.005,1.0000,"The addition of adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) to ongoing lamivudine therapy is effective against lamivudine-resistant virus in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We studied 39 patients who received ADV added to lamivudine for breakthrough hepatitis. We determined early viral changes (12 weeks) in YMDD mutants (rtM204I [YIDD sequence], rtM204V [YVDD]) and rtL180M in all 39 patients as well as amino acid changes in the polymerase reverse transcriptase (rt) region and precore/core promoter mutations in 15 patients who received long-term treatment (more than 1 year). Changes in rtM204I and rtL180M viral loads were greater than that of the rtM204V, albeit statistically insignificant. Moreover, the greatest change in viral load was seen for rtM204I without hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). The precore mutant was replaced with wild-type virus in three of eight patients after 1 year of added ADV therapy. Compared to baseline with lamivudine therapy only, new amino acid mutations were seen in the rt region at baseline with ADV in seven patients. At 1 year after ADV coadministration, the YMDD motif was replaced with wild-type (rt204M) in two patients, in whom mutations were fewer and of a different type. We conclude that the rtM204I may be more sensitive to ADV in vivo. ADV tended to select wild-type virus from precore mutants. Moreover, viruses that were wild-type in the rt region reappeared after 1 year of ADV coadministration in some patients."
5049,0.005,1.0000,"In chimpanzees and in vitro cell culture studies, hepatitis C infection has been shown to suppress hepatitis B virus expression. In addition, hepatitis C infection can cause much more severe liver disease in patients chronically infected with hepatitis B virus. The aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C infection in asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B Hong Kong Chinese patients and the histological changes and hepatic expression of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. Five hundred and seventy-one Hong Kong Chinese asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B patients were studied. Only four (0.7%) were hepatitis C virus antibody positive; they were also all positive for hepatitis C viral RNA in serum by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Portal lymphoid aggregates and bile duct damage was noted in the liver sections of three of the four patients. Hepatic expression of hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in three patients; none had detectable hepatitis B core antigen. By branched DNA assay, serum hepatitis B DNA could not be detected in any of the four patients, but three had hepatitis C RNA. By in situ RT-PCR, hepatitis C RNA was detected in the cytoplasm of three of the four patients. These findings suggest that hepatitis C coinfection in asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B patients is uncommon in Hong Kong Chinese and active hepatitis B viral replication is absent in these patients."
1546,0.005,1.0000,"Genomic rearrangements in the 5' part of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) have been involved in multidrug resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTI). We carried out a retrospective, multicenter study to investigate the prevalence, variability, and phenotypic consequences of such rearrangements. Data concerning the HIV-1 RT genotype and the biological and clinical characteristics of NRTI-treated patients were collected from 10 virology laboratories. Sensitivities of the different HIV-1 variants to RT inhibitors were analyzed in a single-cycle recombinant virus assay. Fifty-two of 2,152 (2.4%) RT sequences had a rearrangement in the 5' part of the RT, with an extensive molecular variation. The number of codons inserted between positions 68 and 69 ranged from 1 (3 samples) or 2 (41 samples) to 5 and 11 in one case each. In four cases, codon 67 was deleted. High levels of phenotypic resistance to zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), abacavir (ABC), and didanosine (ddI) were found in 95, 92, 72, 62, and 15% of the 40 samples analyzed, respectively. Resistance to AZT, d4T, and ABC could be found in the absence of the T215Y/F mutations. Resistance to 3TC could develop in the absence of specific mutations. Low-level resistance to ddI was noticed in 40% of the patients. The deletions of codon 67 seemed to have little effect on NRTI sensitivity. Most of the rearrangements were shown to contribute to cross-resistance to NRTI. The results regarding susceptibility to ddI raise the question of the interpretation of the phenotypic data concerning this drug."
6955,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has fundamentally changed the clinical outcome of HIV infection and AIDS. However, the emergence of drug-resistant HIV variants is a barrier to successful use of HAART, with resistance to one drug often resulting in cross-resistance to many, if not all, others in the same class. The rise in the incidence of drug-resistant variants among newly infected patients also represents a formidable challenge for clinicians. Failure of the current HAART regimen due to drug resistance can severely limit second-line, third-line, and salvage treatment options. Although inadequate exposure of the virus to antiretroviral agents is a prime reason for the emergence of HIV drug-resistant variants, poor adherence to complicated regimens and variability in drug pharmacokinetics (PK), both within and between HIV-infected individuals, can also affect the overall efficacy of antiretroviral agents, promoting emergence of resistant HIV variants. Recent strategies to optimize antiretroviral drug regimens, including assessment of HIV genotype and/or phenotype, the use of protease inhibitor regimens that incorporate PK boosting, and scheduled treatment interruptions, have been explored. Additionally, several newer antiretroviral agents that produce rapid and sustained virologic and immunologic responses as well as novel resistance profiles (e.g. atazanavir and tenofovir) have become available. These characteristics thus increase the likelihood of durable viral suppression."
6508,0.005,1.0000,"Multiple nucleoside resistance involves specific genetic changes in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase gene, such as Q151M mutation and an insertion of two serine aminoacids at RT codon 69. Among 432 patients failing antiretroviral therapy, five (1.15%) harboured viruses with Q151M mutation into the RT gene and no viruses were identified harbouring insertion at codon 69. Also we have studied the long-term benefit of HIV genotypic testing with the failure to reach a viral load below 50 copies/ml within 1 year of antiretroviral therapy using as the primary end-point. A group of 64 HIV-positive antiretroviral multiexperienced patients were examined, all of them failing the current ART. HIV-RNA changed -0.8 log at month 4 and +0.1 log and -0.5 log at months 8 and 12, respectively. The proportion of patients with viral load below 50 copies/ml was 19.3, 32.8, and 28.1% at months 4, 8, and 12, respectively. In multidrug-experienced patients, genotype-guided therapy is not in fact able to achieve complete viral suppression in more than 30% of patients after 1 year of ART. The development of more precise resistance tests and interpretations are needed for better control of HIV replication. Other metabolic/pharmacokinetics factors of poor drug adherence should also be assessed."
7572,0.005,1.0000,"Psychiatric disorders are common among people living with HIV in Nigeria. Adherence is necessary to optimise the outcome of antiretroviral therapy. In this study, we aimed to identify associations between antiretroviral adherence, measured by one-week and one-month self-reported missed doses, and psychiatric illness in a cohort previously assessed for psychiatric disorders using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The study participants comprised 151 adults with major depression, anxiety or suicidal symptoms, and 302 matched-control participants. Two controls were randomly selected for each case within the same gender and education level. We compared participants with psychiatric disorders (WPDs) and no psychiatric disorders (NPDs) on selected demographic and clinical variables, in addition to adherence. Participants with one or more missed doses in the preceding month had twice the odds of having a major depressive episode as those with no missed doses during this period (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.03, 4.79). This association remained significant after adjusting for selected risk factors. There was no statistically significant difference between WPD and NPD groups on either one-week or one-month adherence, or on age, marital status, occupational class, HIV viral load at enrolment or current CD4 cell count. Among Nigerian adults with HIV, suboptimal antiretroviral adherence is associated with, and could be a sign of, depression. Routine self-report adherence assessments may potentially be utilised in identifying individuals at risk among this population."
8436,0.005,1.0000,"To clarify the relationship between aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) expression and early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence, this study detected AKR1B10 expression in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 110 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC underwent liver resection and analyzed its correlations with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of these patients. Detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, AKR1B10 mRNA expression showed significantly higher in HCC tissues than in adjacent non-tumor tissues, with a low level in normal liver tissues. Similar results was confirmed at the protein level using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. High AKR1B10 expression was negatively correlated with serum alpha-fetoprotein level and positively correlated with HBV-DNA level. Patients with high AKR1B10 expression had significantly higher disease-free survival than those with low expression within 2 years after liver resection. Multivariate analysis also confirmed high AKR1B10 expression to be a predictor of low risk of early HCC recurrence. In addition, high AKR1B10 expression was found to be a favorable factor of overall survival. These results suggest that AKR1B10 is involved in HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis, but its high expression could predict low risk of early tumor recurrence in patients with HBV-related HCC after liver resection."
3794,0.005,1.0000,"We examined the risk and determinants of developing severe liver toxicity in 108 HIV-infected patients showing adherence to nevirapine- and efavirenz-containing regimens. Between January 1997 and December 2000, 70 patients were treated with nevirapine- and 38 patients with efavirenz-containing regimens, for a median period of 127 days (interquartile range 65-240). Severe liver toxicity was defined as grade 3-4 elevations (>5 x upper limit of normal) of aminotransferases AST or ALT. A total of 22 (20%) patients showed severe liver toxicity, 17 of them were treated with nevirapine- and five with efavirenz-containing regimens (relative risk [RR]: 1.85, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 0.74-4.61; P=not significant). Multivariate analysis showed the association of severe liver toxicity with hepatitis C antibody positive (RR 7.64; 95% CI: 1.48-39.52; P=0.01), nevirapine- or efavirenz-containing regimens combined with a protease inhibitor (RR: 3.07, 95% CI: 1.01-9.32, P=0.04) and alcohol intake greater than 40 g per day (RR: 3.09, 95% CI: 1.27-7.54, P=0.01).

8284,0.005,1.0000,"Mutations in the basal core promoter (BCP) and precore (PC) regions are associated with persistent and intermittently high hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication in several patients. The variability in the functional domains of BCP and PC region of HBV and their association with disease progression and clinical outcome were assessed in Eastern India, an unique region where three HBV genotypes, A, D, and C are prevalent among the same ethnic group. PCR amplification and direct sequencing of BCP and PC region was done on sera obtained from 130 HBsAg positive subjects with different clinical presentations. Associations of the apparent risk factors with clinical advancement were evaluated by statistical methods including multiple logistic regression analyses (MLR). HBV genotype A was present in 33.08%, C in 25.38%, and D in 41.54% cases. Genotypes A and C were associated with higher rate of T1762/A1764 mutations than the most predominant genotype D. HBeAg negative state was associated with considerably higher rate of C1753 mutation. T1762/A1764 along with C1753 was common among cirrhosis and T1762/A1764 without C1753 was frequent among chronic liver disease cases. No significant association was found between A1896 point mutation and clinical status. Multivariate analysis revealed that T1762/A1764 double mutation, HBV/A, age ‚â•25 years, C1753 and A1899 were critical factors for clinical advancement while age ‚â•25 years and C1753 as significant predictor for cirrhosis in comparison with chronic liver disease. In conclusion, the analysis of the BCP variability may help in monitoring the progression towards advanced liver disease in Eastern Indian patients."
7566,0.005,1.0000,"Expression of HLA-B57 is associated with restricted replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the mechanism for its protective effect remains unknown. If this advantage depends upon CD8 T-cell recognition of B57-restricted epitopes, mother-to-child transmission of escape mutations within these epitopes could nullify its protective effect. However, if the B57 advantage is largely mediated by selection for fitness-attenuating viral mutations within B57-restricted epitopes, such as T242N in TW10-Gag, then the transmission of such mutations could facilitate viral control in the haploidentical infant. We assessed the consequences of B57-associated mutations on replication capacity, viral control, and clinical outcome after vertical transmission in 13 mother-child pairs. We found that expression of HLA-B57 was associated with exceptional control of HIV during infancy, even when mutations within TW10 and most other B57-restricted epitopes were transmitted, subverting the natural immunodominance of HLA-B57. In contrast, most B57-negative infants born to B57-positive mothers progressed rapidly to AIDS. The presence of T242N led to a reproducible reduction in viral fitness, as demonstrated by in vitro assays using NL4-3 constructs encoding p24 sequences from individual mothers and infants. Associated compensatory mutations within p24-Gag were observed to reverse this impairment and to influence the propensity of T242N to revert after transmission to B57-negative hosts. Moreover, primary failure to control viremia was observed in one infant to whom multiple compensatory mutations were transmitted along with T242N. These parallel in vivo and in vitro data suggest that HLA-B57 confers its advantage primarily by driving and maintaining a fitness-attenuating mutation in p24-Gag."
4120,0.005,1.0000,"CD8+ T lymphocytes of HIV-1 infected individuals produce a soluble factor that efficiently suppresses HIV-1 replication at the transcriptional level. We show here that the response of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) to mitogenic or Tat-mediated activation is sensitive to the suppressive action of a Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-transformed CD8+ T cell clone from an HIV-infected individual and supernatants from CD8+ T cells of HIV-1-infected asymptomatic subjects (CD4+ > 350/microliters). Mutagenesis of NF kappa B or Sp-1 elements within the LTR resulted in no change in the ability of CD8+ T cell supernatants to inhibit Tat- or mitogen-mediated LTR transcription. However, the response to HIV-1 Tat by a LTR in which the interleukin (IL)-2 homology NFAT-1 region was mutated resulted in almost complete elimination of suppression by CD8+ T cells. This was not observed when the NFAT-1 mutant LTR was activated by mitogen. We have previously shown that gene expression directed by the HIV-1 NF kappa B elements is inhibited by CD8+ cell-derived supernatants (Copeland et al., AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses, 1995;11:1321-1326). Taken together, these observations suggest that mitogenic activation, mediated primarily through the NF kappa B enhancer, is susceptible to CD8-mediated inhibition, however, inhibition of Tat-mediated activation may rely upon a different pathway that is NFAT-1 dependent."
3324,0.005,1.0000,"The role of the adenosine (ADO) pathway in human immunodeficiency virus type 1/simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1/SIV) infection remains unclear. We compared SIVsab-induced changes of markers related to ADO production (CD39 and CD73) and breakdown (CD26 and adenosine deaminase) on T cells from blood, lymph nodes, and intestine collected from pigtailed macaques (PTMs) and African green monkeys (AGMs) that experience different SIVsab infection outcomes. We also measured ADO and inosine (INO) levels in tissues by mass spectrometry. Finally, we assessed the suppressive effect of ADO on proinflammatory cytokine production after T cell receptor stimulation. The baseline level of both CD39 and CD73 coexpression on regulatory T cells and ADO levels were higher in AGMs than in PTMs. Conversely, high INO levels associated with dramatic increases in CD26 expression and adenosine deaminase activity were observed in PTMs during chronic SIV infection. Immune activation and inflammation markers in the gut and periphery inversely correlated with ADO and directly correlated with INO. Ex vivo administration of ADO significantly suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production by T cells in both species. In conclusion, the opposite dynamics of ADO pathway-related markers and contrasting ADO/INO levels in species with divergent proinflammatory responses to SIV infection support a key role of ADO in controlling immune activation/inflammation in nonprogressive SIV infections. Changes in ADO levels predominately occurred in the gut, suggesting that the ADO pathway may be involved in sparing natural hosts of SIVs from developing SIV-related gut dysfunction. Focusing studies of the ADO pathway on mucosal sites of viral replication is warranted."
5559,0.005,1.0000,"The relationship between 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5AS) and HLA class I antigen in the hepatocyte of patients with type B or type C chronic hepatitis with and without interferon (IFN) therapy was investigated. The expression of HLA class I antigen of hepatocytes of biopsied specimen and PBL HLA class I antigen expression showed relevancy. Then, the HLA antigen expression of peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) and the 2-5AS activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were analyzed. In patients with type B or type C hepatitis, the mean activity of PBMC 2-5AS was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. Also the HLA class I antigen expression of PBL was significantly intense in patients with type B or type C hepatitis compared with healthy controls. In the acute exacerbated phase of type B chronic hepatitis, the HLA class I antigen expression of PBL and 2-5AS activity of PBMC increased along with elevation of serum GPT and then decreased with the remission of serum GPT. These results suggest that endogenously produced IFN leads the lysis of hepatocyte infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) by cytotoxic T cells, and the restriction of HBV replication by activation of the 2-5A system simultaneously, and then leads the elimination of HBV. The activity of PBMC 2-5AS and the expression of PBL HLA class I antigen increased significantly during IFN therapy. In type B chronic hepatitis, the effective cases showed relatively high activity of serum 2-5AS compared with the non-effective cases. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in PBL HLA class I antigen expression between effective cases and non-effective cases. In type C chronic hepatitis, most patients with type III and type IV HCV genotype showed disappearance of HCV-RNA regardless of serum 2-5AS activity. In patients with type II HCV genotype, the serum 2-5AS activity was related to the anti-viral effect of IFN therapy."
9855,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can result in both hepatic and extrahepatic disease and endocrine dysfunction represents an important class of HCV-related extrahepatic disease. The most frequently occurring--and clinically important--of these endocrine disorders are thyroid disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this Review, we evaluate the evidence in support of a link between HCV infection and endocrine-system dysfunction, and discuss potential pathophysiological mechanisms. A meta-analysis of the literature has revealed significant associations between chronic HCV infection, thyroid autoimmunity and hypothyroidism. Furthermore, a high prevalence of thyroid cancer has been reported in HCV-positive patients. Several clinicoepidemiological studies have demonstrated that chronic HCV infection could lead to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, possibly as a result of HCV-induced metabolic disturbances. Some researchers have postulated that a type 1 T-helper -cell mediated immune response underpins the association of chronic HCV infection with endocrine disease. Indeed, the available data suggest that a common immunological, type 1 T-helper cell pattern of cytokine expression and activation (via interferon-gamma) could provide the pathophysiological basis for this association. Nonetheless, additional studies will be necessary to elucidate fully all the mechanisms involved in HCV-related endocrine dysfunction."
8611,0.005,1.0000,"Approximately 50% of late-stage HIV patients develop CXCR4-tropic (X4) virus in addition to CCR5-tropic (R5) virus. X4 emergence occurs with a sharp decline in CD4+ T cell counts and accelerated time to AIDS. Why this phenotypic switch to X4 occurs is not well understood. Previously, we used numerical simulations of a mathematical model to show that across much of parameter space a promising new class of antiretroviral treatments, CCR5 inhibitors, can accelerate X4 emergence and immunodeficiency. Here, we show that mathematical model to be a minimal activation-based HIV model that produces a spontaneous switch to X4 virus at a clinically-representative time point, while also matching in vivo data showing X4 and R5 coexisting and competing to infect memory CD4+ T cells. Our analysis shows that X4 avoids competitive exclusion from an initially fitter R5 virus due to X4v unique ability to productively infect nave CD4+ T cells. We further justify the generalized conditions under which this minimal model holds, implying that a phenotypic switch can even occur when the fraction of activated nave CD4+ T cells increases at a slower rate than the fraction of activated memory CD4+ T cells. We find that it is the ratio of the fractions of activated nave and memory CD4+ T cells that must increase above a threshold to produce a switch. This occurs as the concentration of CD4+ T cells drops beneath a threshold. Thus, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which increases CD4+ T cell counts and decreases cellular activation levels, inhibits X4 viral growth. However, we show here that even in the simplest dual-strain framework, competition between R5 and X4 viruses often results in accelerated X4 emergence in response to CCR5 inhibition, further highlighting the potential danger of anti-CCR5 monotherapy in multi-strain HIV infection."
5999,0.005,1.0000,"A recent addition to the lymphokine network is human IL-10 (hIL-10). This novel lymphokine has striking homology to BCRF1 protein, the product of a previously uncharacterized open-reading frame in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome. To date, IL-10 expression has been described in several T clones induced with anti-CD3 and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), in monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and in murine B-cell lymphomas. We sought to determine whether human B cells express hIL-10 and, if so, its relationship to EBV and to other B-cell lymphokines. We studied 21 EBV-positive B-cell lines derived from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and Burkitt's lymphoma (n = 6), American Burkitt's (n = 3), African Burkitt's (n = 5), and normal lymphoblastoid cell lines (n = 7), in comparison with seven EBV-negative cell lines. All cell lines were activated with the tumor promoters PMA and teleocidin and were studied by Northern blot analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). We demonstrated that EBV-positive cell lines derived from patients with American Burkitt's lymphoma, and especially those from patients with AIDS, constitutively express large quantities of hIL-10 by Northern blot analysis and ELISA (range, 3,101 to 25,915 pg/mL), and that both teleocidin and PMA induce hIL-10 in these cell lines. In contrast, six of seven EBV-negative cell lines did not express hIL-10 even by RT-PCR, and hIL-10 was not triggered by PMA or teleocidin. To assure that the 350 bp amplified by PCR was hIL-10 and not BCRF1, we used PCR primers, which do not amplify a fragment from plasmid templates containing BCRF1. Cloning and sequencing of the 350 bp product also demonstrated that B-cell IL-10 is identical to hIL-10 from the T-cell clone B21. Correlation of hIL-10 with other B-cell lymphokines secreted by these B-cell lines demonstrated that hIL-10 secretor cell lines also constitutively secrete or can be induced to secrete IL-6, although to a much lesser amount. Since both lymphokines influence B-cell growth and differentiation, we suggest that hIL-10 may contribute to the polyclonal B-cell activation and hyperglobulinemia seen in AIDS patients. Finally, several reports support the hypothesis that EBV is an important cofactor in the development of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-related B-cell lymphomas. Detection of large quantities of hIL-10 in B-cell lines derived from AIDS patients, the close association between EBV and hIL-10 shown in this report, and the ability of BCRF1 to capture hIL-10 activities, make hIL-10/BCRF1 an attractive candidate as a factor causing B-cell growth and immortalization in patients with AIDS and B-cell lymphomas."

Paired liver biopsies in twenty six HCV/HIV co-infected patients were compared to determine factors possibly associated with histological improvement. The patients were submitted to a liver biopsy before treatment for hepatitis C and 25 months after the end of treatment. Fragments of the liver biopsy obtained before and after treatment were compared regarding the following parameters: histological activity index (HAI) and degree of fibrosis (Knodell); intensity of collagen deposits (Sirius Red staining) and degree of stellate cell activation (alpha-smooth muscle actin labeling). The ratios of the post and pre-treatment variables were related through logistic regression to body mass index (BMI), alcohol ingestion, HCV genotype, HCV viremia, presence of hepatic iron and pre-treatment hepatic steatosis. A negative RNA test in the 24th week of treatment was associated with improvement in fibrosis, collagen deposits and stellate cell numbers. The other variables analyzed did not correlate to an improvement in hepatic histology after hepatitis C treatment. Reduction in HCV viremia during treatment may result in reduced hepatic fibrosis even in patients without a sustained virological response."

Nevertheless statins up-regulate low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, required for HCV cell entry, and the closely related scavenger receptors SRBI and CD36; moreover they reduce class II major histocompatibility complex expression on antigen presenting cell, modulating T-cell activation. In vivo LDL levels have been identified as prognostic indicator of sustained viral response to IFN in patients with HCV infection, suggesting that lipid-lowering agents might conversely favour HCV entry into the hepatocytes and translate into higher viral replication. We evaluated the effect of fluvastatin on HCV-RNA levels, CD36 expression and T-cell homeostasis in HCV-RNA positive patients. HCV-RNA was measured at baseline and after 4 weeks in 42 HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients, randomized to receive either fluvastatin 80 mg qd or no treatment. CD36 expression and markers of T-cell activation were evaluated by means of flow cytometry. Plasma interleukin (IL)-10, IFN-gamma and IL-7 were measured by ELISA. Serum cholesterol and LDL decreased significantly in the treatment group (P = 0.0001 and 0.01, respectively). Surprisingly a significant increase of HCV-RNA levels was seen after 4 weeks of fluvastatin (P = 0.03). The percentages of naive/activated/apoptotic cells and CD36 expression remained unchanged. Fluvastatin did not inhibit HCV-RNA replication in vivo; conversely we observed a significant increase of HCV-RNA levels. CD36 expression on monocytes were not up-regulated by statins as previously reported in vitro. The correlation between HCV infectivity, oxidized-LDL receptor and statins in HCV infection need further evaluation."
6494,0.005,1.0000,"We have established a line of malignantly transformed human B cells by infecting purified primary B lymphocytes with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This line, termed B-HIV1, may serve as a model system for a subset of AIDS-related B-cell lymphomas in which the transformed phenotype may be initiated and/or maintained through an HIV-1 gene product. The B-HIV1 line contains both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HIV-1 genomes. In addition, the c-myc gene is expressed at levels 10 to 20 times those in normal B cells. Similarly, EBV sequences, including those for the latent membrane protein (LMP), are expressed at greatly enhanced levels relative to expression in normal, EBV-immortalized B cells. The upregulation of c-myc and of EBV gene expression can both be produced by infection of susceptible B cells (not already harboring HIV) with exogenous HIV-1. The B-HIV1 line exhibits properties of malignantly transformed cells, in that it grows logarithmically in 1% serum, clones in soft agar, and produces invasive, malignant B-cell lymphomas in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. We have shown that HIV-1 has the ability to infect primary human B cells and to activate expression of EBV and c-myc. HIV activation of EBV has been documented previously in certain cell lines, here we note that such activation can occur in primary B cells and, under certain conditions, can result in outgrowth of immortalized cell lines. This phenomenon may contribute to the clinical manifestation of lymphadenopathy early after infection with HIV. In addition, we have demonstrated that HIV infection of primary B cells in vitro can result in appearance of a fully malignant phenotype. This phenotype is likely to be due, at least in part, to the activation of c-myc by HIV. Preliminary experiments indicate that Tat, the gene product of the transactivator of viral gene transcription tat, can upregulate c-myc transcription after addition to the culture media of certain B-cell lines. This raises the possibility that Tat can bind to target sequences in cellular RNA and enhance transcription as it does for HIV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
5104,0.005,1.0000,"Multiple inhibitory receptors may play a role in the weak or absent CD8+ T-cell response in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Yet few receptors have been characterized in detail and little is known about their complex regulation. In the present study, we investigated the role of the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-related receptor CD244 and of programmed death 1 (PD-1) in HBV infection in 15 acutely and 66 chronically infected patients as well as 9 resolvers and 21 healthy controls. The expression of CD244, PD-1, and T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) was analyzed in virus-specific CD8+ T-cells derived from peripheral blood or liver using major histocompatibility complex class I pentamers targeting immunodominant epitopes of HBV, Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV), or influenza virus (Flu). In chronic HBV infection, virus-specific CD8+ T-cells expressed higher levels of CD244 both in the peripheral blood and liver in comparison to the acute phase of infection or following resolution. CD244 was expressed at similarly high levels in EBV infection, but was low on Flu-specific CD8+ T-cells. In chronic HBV infection, high-level CD244 expression coincided with an increased expression of PD-1. The inhibition of the CD244 signaling pathway by antibodies directed against either CD244 or its ligand CD48 resulted in an increased virus-specific proliferation and cytotoxicity as measured by the expression of CD107a, interferon-Œ≥, and tumor necrosis factor-Œ± in CD8+ T-cells."

It is important to understand these behaviors in order to develop strategies oriented at decreasing unsafe sex practices. A random sample of 140 HIV-positive individuals was recruited from an HIV primary care clinic in Buenos Aires, Argentina, between August and September 2005. Participants responded survey questions regarding their sexual behaviors in the previous three months. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with inconsistent condom use during vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Of the 140 participants surveyed, 69% were male, the mean age was 38 years old, 29% reported having less than a high school education, and 84% reported having engaged in vaginal, anal, and/or oral sex in the past 3 months. Of 53 participants who reported engaging in anal sex, 60% were men who have sex with men, and 40% were heterosexuals. Inconsistent condom use was reported by 31% of participants engaging in anal sex, 39% of participants engaging in vaginal sex, and 71% of participants engaging in oral sex. When adjusting for other factors, participants reporting symptoms of depression were 5.2 times more likely to use condoms inconsistently during vaginal sex, and 4.3 times more likely to use condoms inconsistently during anal sex compared to participants reporting no depression symptoms. Providers should assess sexual risk practices of HIV-positive individuals reporting symptoms of depression, and provide counseling regarding the importance of consistent condom use to those patients who are engaging in unsafe sex practices."

IDUs (n = 773) in a community-based needle exchange programme (NEP) and two major drug treatment facilities in Sofia completed a structured interview and were tested for HIV, HBV, and HCV antibodies. While HCV prevalence in the sample was 73.9%, HBV and HIV prevalence was low -6% and 0.5%, respectively. Having more than 10 sexual partners, having sex with someone with hepatitis C or another IDU, and never using a condom with another IDU were common among those who were recruited through NEP. As 40% of the IDUs reported using NEP, it appears that needle exchange provides an opportunity to reach high-risk populations and prevent sexual transmission of blood-borne pathogens."
1803,0.005,1.0000,"Prevalence of and risk factors for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were determined among 252 homosexual men with no history of intravenous drug use (median age 33 years, range 18-77) treated at a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Rome. The overall prevalence of antibodies to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) was 50.8%, a rate nearly nine times as high as the 5.8% found recently in a national sample of young male adults, aged 18-26 years, and twice as high as the 22% found in heterosexuals attending the same clinic over the same period of time. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of anti-HBc positivity was independently associated with increasing age, five or more sexual partners in the previous year, positive HIV serology and positive syphilis serology. Lower level of schooling, lack of condom use, history of non-ulcerative STD, current or past history of genital herpes, and positive anti-HCV serology were not associated with anti-HBc positivity. These findings corroborate the importance of sexual transmission of HBV in homosexual men. Behavioural factors, such as multiple sexual partners, probably enhance the efficiency of this mode of HBV transmission."
1769,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B is one of the most important causes of chronic viral hepatitis world wide. Mutations in the precore region of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome are frequently found in hepatitis B envelope antigen-negative cases. Data from India on the HBV genotype-associated distribution of precore mutations are limited. Our objective in this study was to genotype and detect the precore mutant with a point mutation from G to A at nucleotide 1896 using ligase chain reaction (LCR) and direct sequencing. A total of 115 cases of chronic liver disease were screened. The cases were evaluated on the basis of history, clinical examination, liver function profile, and serological test for HBV infection, which includes HBsAg, anti HBcIgG, HBeAg using commercially available ELISA kits. The cases, which were HBeAg+, HBeAg-, and HBV DNA+, were subjected to LCR and confirmed by direct sequencing. Of 115 chronic liver disease cases, 50 (43.5%) cases were HBV DNA positive. All cases were subjected to LCR; 11 (22%) cases confirmed the presence of precore mutants, while the remaining 39 (78%) were classified as the wild form of the virus. HBV genotyping by direct sequencing revealed that genotype D was predominant in both wild and mutant forms of the virus. We conclude that the HBV genotype distribution was not significantly different between precore mutants and the wild form of the virus (P>0.05). North Indian patients with genotype D were more likely to have persistent HBV infection with precore mutants. HBV genotypes correlate with the clinical outcome of chronic HBV infection."

Despite the prevalence of HBV infection in Egypt, few studies have focused on sub-genotyping of the virus. Moreover, no studies are available regarding the mutational analysis of the preS1/preS2 region of the viral genome, or its impact on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in Egypt. In this study, we have analyzed the sub-genotypes and incidence of mutations in the preS1/preS2 region of HBV present in HBV-infected patients, from Mansoura city (located in the center of Nile Delta region of Egypt), via partial sequencing of this specific region. Moreover, we have investigated the impact of these mutations on HCC development by measuring serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level and abdominal ultrasound examination of the HBV-infected patients. According to our results, all samples were genotype D in which sub-genotype D1 was predominant. In addition, the results revealed mutations in the preS1/preS2 region, which could result in either immature preS1 protein or completely inhibit the translation of the preS2 protein. However, there was no incidence of HCC development in patients infected with mutated HBV in the preS1/preS2 region. In summary, for the first time our work has proved the predominance of sub-genotype D1 among HBV-infected Egyptian patients in Mansoura city, Nile Delta region, Egypt, and incidence of mutations in the preS1/preS2 region of HBV genome. This current study opens up research opportunities to discuss the impact of HBV mutations on the development of HCC in Egypt."

The factors driving different outcomes are not well understood, but there is increasing interest in an HLA class I effect. We therefore studied the influence of HLA class I on HBV in an African HIV-positive cohort. We demonstrated that virologic markers of HBV disease activity (hepatitis B e antigen status or HBV DNA level) are associated with HLA-A genotype. This finding supports the role of the CD8(+) T-cell response in HBV control, and potentially informs future therapeutic T-cell vaccine strategies. "
5229,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B was characterized by fluctuant immune response to infected hepatocytes resulting in hepatic inflammation and virus persistence. Recently, Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 have been demonstrated to play an essential role in balancing antiviral immunity and inflammation in the livers of acute hepatitis B patients, significantly influencing disease outcome. PD-1 up-regulation in peripheral T cells is associated with immune dysfunction in chronic hepatitis B patients. However, the effect of PD-1/PD-L1 on hepatic damage and chronic infective status is still unknown in patients with chronic HBV infection. Here, we report up-regulation of PD-1 and PD-L1 in liver biopsies from 32 chronic HBV patients compared to 4 healthy donors. PD-1/PD-L1 up-regulation was significantly associated with hepatic inflammation and ALT elevation. Moreover, appropriate up-regulation but not overexpression of PD-L1 in the active phase of chronic hepatitis B as well as lower expression of PD-L1 in the inactive phase in liver residential antigen presenting cells (including Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells) may contribute to viral inhibition. Our data suggest that the intrahepatic interaction of PD-1 and PD-L1 might play an important role in balancing the immune response to HBV and immune-mediated liver damage in chronic HBV infection."

6768,0.005,1.0000,"Cases of tuberculosis identified during 1992-1994 through an active tuberculosis surveillance network among six hospitals that serve New York City (the TBNetwork) were analyzed according to the occupational status of the patients. Clinical data were obtained by review of medical records, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was performed. No known nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred at these hospitals in the study period. Occupational status was known for 142 of 201 patients whose isolates were available for strain typing. Patients infected by organisms with a clustered strain typing pattern, as determined by RFLP analysis, were presumed to have recently acquired disease. RFLP typing revealed that isolates from 13 (65%) of 20 health care workers and 50 (41%) of 122 non-health care workers had a clustered RFLP pattern. The strains infecting eight (89%) of nine health care workers seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had a clustered RFLP pattern. Multivariate analysis of 75 patients with known HIV and occupational status revealed that HIV status (P = .03) and health care worker status (P = .02; RR = 2.77) were independent risk factors for a clustered RFLP strain. These findings suggest that many of the apparently sporadic cases of tuberculosis among health care workers may be due to unrecognized occupational transmission."
8574,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus infection affects approximately 10% of HIV-infected patients. There are an estimated 4 million patients with HIV/HBV coinfection. HIV infection has a deleterious effect on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B and increases the risk of progression to cirrhosis and terminal liver disease. Since the widespread use of highly active antiviral therapy (HAART), liver disease has emerged as one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive patients. Therefore, all patients with HIV/HBV coinfection should be evaluated for treatment of hepatitis B, independently of the CD4 lymphocyte count. Six drugs are currently authorized for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B: standard interferon-alpha (2a and 2b), pegylated interferon alpha-2a, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and telbivudine. Other drugs with activity against HBV, such as tenofovir and emtricitabine, are used for the treatment of HIV infection. In patients not requiring HAART, treatment of hepatitis B should preferably consist of drugs without activity against HIV, such as pegylated interferon or adefovir. In contrast, in patients requiring HAART, a combination of drugs with activity against both viruses should be used, such as lamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir, with the aim of achieving maximal viral suppression and avoiding the development of resistance. Patients with HIV/HBV coinfection require periodic clinical and virological monitoring. Patients with cirrhosis should undergo ultrasonography and alphafetoprotein determination every 6 months for the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma."

After cloning of full-length HBV genome, the effects of viral genotype, precore and BCP mutations singly or additively on the expression of viral DNA and antigens were investigated by mutagenesis and transfection assays in Huh7 cells. Significant findings included the following: (i) expression of intracellular core protein increased when precore or BCP mutation was introduced in genotype C strains; (ii) expression of intracellular surface protein was lower in genotype C precore wild-type strain compared with genotype B; (iii) precore mutation was associated with a lower extracellular expression level of HBV DNA; (iv) secretion of hepatitis B surface antigen in genotype C was lower than that in genotype B; and (v) secretion of HBeAg in genotype B was lower than that in genotype C. No additive effect was observed by combining precore and BCP mutations. Hence, HBV genotype and precore/BCP mutations correlate with intrahepatic expression of viral antigens in vitro."

The PNA probe used in the present study possessed 15 base sequences of the HIV-1 protease gene, and the 5' end of the probe was labelled with the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecule. The hybridized probe was detected by sequential reactions of the following antibodies and reagents: horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-FITC antibody, biotinylated tyramide (first amplification), HRP-labelled streptavidin, biotinylated tyramide (second amplification), and streptavidin-conjugated Alexa 488. The signal of Alexa 488 was finally detected by fluorescence microscopy. HIV-1-related dotted signals were clearly obtained in HIV-1 persistently infected cell lines, MOLT4-III(B) and ACH-2, and CD4-positive T lymphocytes from AIDS patients. For light microscopy, HRP-labelled streptavidin was reacted instead of streptavidin-conjugated Alexa 488 at the final treatment, followed by diaminobenzidine as chromogen. This method can detect HIV-1 in either blood smear samples or paraffin-embedded autopsy tissue and is useful as a sensitive non-radioactive method for in situ hybridization."

The authors recently developed a method to detect the HCV-RNA genome in plasma using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the present study, the specificity of this assay in detecting HCV infection was investigated. Freshly obtained 1 ml plasma specimens from 100 patients with various liver diseases and from 11 control subjects were studied. In patients with non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis-related liver diseases, HCV-RNA was detected in 2 out of 7 cases of acute hepatitis, in 29 out of 31 cases of chronic hepatitis, in 17 out of 21 cases of cirrhosis and in 2 out of 6 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. On the other hand, no HCV-RNA was detected in 15 cases of various types of alcoholic liver diseases, in 12 cases of hepatitis B related liver diseases, and in 11 controls. HCV-RNA was detected in 2 of 6 drinkers with chronic hepatitis. The prevalence of HCV-RNA was not closely related to a history of blood transfusions. These results suggest that our method for HCV-RNA is specific for HCV infection and HCV infection is the likely etiology of most chronic NANB hepatitis cases. The clinical usefulness of our method is illustrated by the fact that we were able to study 100 patients and needed only 1 ml plasma per HCV-RNA assay."

The feces samples of these patients were processed and analyzed according to the following methods: Lutz, formalin ethyl acetate, Baermann, Harada-Mori and agar plate culture. HIV-positive patients were more frequently infected by S. stercoralis (odds ratio= 5,.687). Among the methods used on fecal specimens, the larvae of S. stercoralis were most efficiently detected by the agar plate (69.7%) method, followed by the Baermann and the formalin ethyl acetate methods (48.5%) (P=0.01), Lutz (42.4%) (P=0.01), and Harada-Mori culture (24%) (P=0.001).

HIV-1 induces a condition resembling classical subcortical dementia, known as HAD. The immune mechanisms contributing to HAD have not been elucidated. Cytokine expression in CSF was determined by solid-phase protein array in 33 neurologically asymptomatic HIV-positive male patients and were compared to levels in non-HIV controls and patients with HAD. Neurological examinations and lumbar and venous punctures were conducted in all patients and controls. Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, and IL-10, were up-regulated in all treated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients independent of neurological status compared to controls. In contrast, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-1alpha, IL-15, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were highly expressed in patients with HAD compared to undemented HIV-positive patients. These results show that solid-phase protein array can detect immunological changes in patients infected with HIV. Cytokine expression levels differ in different disease stages and in patients on different treatment paradigms. Pending further validation on a larger number of patients, this method may be a useful tool in CSF diagnostics and the longitudinal evaluation of patient with HAD."
4806,0.005,1.0000,"Medication adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is currently a topic of major importance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome care. HAART has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV infection. Many people with HIV now live active and productive lives, with the disease itself having minimal impact on their lifespan. Unlike treatment for other chronic diseases, achieving the full benefit of HAART requires an extremely high level of adherence to potent antiretroviral combinations that is often difficult to achieve given the high pill burdens, drug interactions and adverse events associated with treatment. In this paper, the present knowledge regarding antiretroviral medication adherence is summarized with a focus on understanding the importance of adherence, the relationship between adherence and treatment response, the challenges and barriers facing patients trying to achieve optimal adherence, reasons for nonadherence, and the current directions and issues relevant to future adherence research."

No viral cDNA (either early or late transcripts) was detected by PCR in monocytes exposed to virus on the day of isolation. In contrast, in monocytes cultured for as little as 1 day, initiated and completed reverse transcripts were readily detectable within 24 h of infection with both HIV-1(Ba-L) and primary isolates. The levels of initiated, partially completed, and completed viral DNA copies found 24 h after infection increased progressively with time in culture before infection. Unlike quiescent T lymphocytes, there appeared to be no block or delay in the integration of viral DNA into the genome of susceptible cultured monocytes. With an Alu-PCR method designed to specifically detect proviral DNA being used, integration events were found within 24 h of infection in monocytes cultured for a day or more after isolation. No integration signal was found in freshly isolated monocytes up to 7 days following exposure to the virus. Cloning and sequencing of Alu-PCR-amplified DNA confirmed integration in HIV-1-infected cultured monocytes. Our finding that in vitro replication of HIV-1 is clearly blocked prior to the initiation of reverse transcription in freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes suggests that these cells may not be susceptible to infection in vivo. Further studies to clarify this possibility and the nature of the block to infection should provide useful information for treatment strategies against HIV-1."

However, the success of current HIV treatment programs depends not only on access to ART, but also on retention in care and good treatment adherence. This is necessary to achieve viral suppression, prevent virologic failure, and reduce viral transmission and HIV/AIDS-related deaths. Previous studies in Cameroon showed poor adherence, treatment interruption, and loss to follow-up among HIV+ subjects on ART, but the factors that influence ART adherence are not well known. In the current cross-sectional study, patient/self-reported questionnaires and pharmacy medication refill data were used to quantify ART adherence and determine the factors associated with increased risk of non-adherence among HIV-infected Cameroonians. We demonstrated that drug side-effects, low CD4 cell counts and higher viral loads are associated with increased risk of non-adherence, and compared to females, males were more likely to forego ART because of side effects (p<0.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that subjects with opportunistic infections (on antibiotics) had 2.42-times higher odds of having been non-adherent (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis controlling for ART regimen, age, gender, and education showed that subjects with opportunistic infections had 3.1-times higher odds of having been non-adherent (p<0.0003), with significantly longer periods of non-adherence, compared to subjects without opportunistic infections (p = 0.02). We further showed that compared to younger subjects (‚â§40 years), older subjects (>40 years) were less likely to be non-adherent (p<0.01) and had shorter non-adherent periods (p<0.0001). The presence of depression symptoms correlated with non-adherence to ART during antibiotic treatment (r = 0.53, p = 0.04), and was associated with lower CD4 cell counts (p = 0.04) and longer non-adherent periods (p = 0.04). Change in ART regimen was significantly associated with increased likelihood of non-adherence and increased duration of the non-adherence period. Addressing these underlying risk factors could improve ART adherence, retention in care and treatment outcomes for HIV/AIDS patients in Cameroon."

We also conducted a focus group of 12 of these interviewees. Availability of medication in health facilities did not automatically ensure access to those in need. A prerequisite for commencing on treatment was a positive documented HIV test result, but too few HIV testing centres, fear of family and community rejection and male domination in sexual and social decision-making prevented a number from coming forward to be tested. Once within the system of care, further barriers, such as rumours of bad side-effects, inconsistent information, high costs of drugs (at the time of the first interviews), ongoing costs of additional medical tests, overcrowded systems and overworked staff, all hindered access to receiving treatment. When taken, therapy brought side-effects, the most common being increased appetite and hunger. Yet, despite these barriers and challenges many of those on treatment reported good adherence. Immediate factors, such as seeing ill people becoming well; being supported by a friend or family member; and having a watch or clock to keep to a regular regime, were important. The increase in the number of people who were expected to die but were now looking well also shifted community attitudes. HIV/AIDS is beginning to move from a hidden terminal disease to a chronic condition that is treatable."
5232,0.005,1.0000,"India has approximately 5.2 million persons infected with HIV. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is being widely introduced in public clinics, many HIV-infected persons still seek care via the private sector. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2004 at six public and private sites to characterize the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of ART among patients with HIV receiving care in India. Of 1667 persons surveyed, 609 (36%) had heard of ART and 19% of these persons reported that ART could cure HIV. Twenty-four percent reported that they were currently taking ART, with 18% of these patients not actually on ART according to their provider. Major barriers to taking ART were cost (33%), lack of knowledge of ART (41%), and deferral by physician (30%). More than half of all public and private patients had not heard of CD4 (57%) or viral load testing (80%), and even fewer had received these tests (32% and 11%, respectively). Private clinic attendees were almost 4 times more likely to be on ART (35% versus 9%, p < 0.0001), more likely to be male, have a higher education, be partnered, have a higher income, and have had a CD4 or viral load (p < 0.0001). Overall, low levels of ART knowledge and access were observed among HIV infected patients, with access to ART being particularly low among patients attending public clinics. In order to make widespread dissemination of ART effective in India, further educational and programmatic efforts are likely needed to optimize access, treatment awareness, and compliance among patients with HIV."
1957,0.005,1.0000,"As the HIV epidemic threatens the social fabric of countries struggling with HIV prevalence rates as high as 10% to 30%, access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone is only the beginning of the clinical challenge. There is a need to identify adherence indicators that will ensure long-term treatment success. A cross-sectional review of 921 adult patients on ART for at least 1 year was conducted. Through an administered adherence survey, key indicators were found to be highly correlated with patient adherence. The adherence rate in this sample was 72% after being on treatment for an average of 15 months. This data suggest that having a high perceived quality of care and owning one's own home positively affected patients' adherence. Indicators such as alcohol use in the last month and a high level of depression negatively affected patients' adherence. Targeting specific indicators for specific interventions will guard against nonadherence, leading to treatment failure."
7398,0.005,1.0000,"Cytokine and immune activation marker levels in plasma are valuable measurements of immune status and treatment effects in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and AIDS. Five populations representing various stages of disease were studied: controls, 2 AIDS groups with <50/mm3 CD4 cells, and 2 groups of HIV-positive subjects-1 with stable CD4 T cells (median, 545/mm3) and 1 with >100/mm3 CD4 cell decline in 1 year. Relatively stable levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble TNF receptor (R)II, soluble interleukin-2R, neopterin, and beta2-microglobulin (beta2M) were documented over 5-8 weeks in patients with AIDS and for 1-4 years in the other groups. beta2M was generally the most stable marker. Interferon-gamma levels, however, fluctuated substantially. Individuals, whether normal or HIV-positive, maintain characteristic plasma levels of cytokines and immune activation markers. Thus, documented changes, in excess of the variability observed in this study, are likely to be significant indicators of change in disease status or effects of therapy."

The goal of this investigation was to assess the risk of postoperative complications in HIV+ patients after tooth extraction. The study was designed as a retrospective cohort study with a sample consisting of 145 males who underwent tooth extraction. The patients' medical and dental records were reviewed to identify HIV serostatus, to document the frequency and type of postoperative complications, and to collect data on potential confounding variables. Forty-four patients were identified as HIV+. The postoperative complication rate in HIV+ patients was 20.9% and for HIV-negative (HIV-) patients 2.9% (relative risk = 7.0, 95% confidence interval = 2.0-25.0, P = 0.001). Furthermore, as the manifestations of the symptoms of HIV infection became more severe, the postextraction complication rate also increased (P = 0.008). The results of this study suggest that HIV+ patients have an increased risk of postextraction complications and as the level of HIV disease increases, the risk of complications also increases. While the findings of this study are consistent with studies based on case series, prospective cohort studies are required to confirm the findings."
2515,0.005,1.0000,"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with various complications such as arthritis, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Hepatitis C is caused by chronic infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV), and eventually leads to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although an association between psoriasis and HCV has been reported, there have been no large case series to date. The aim of the present study was to outline the profiles of HCV-positive psoriatic patients. Patients with a diagnosis of psoriasis who visited Fukuoka University from 1991-2011 were sought in the database, and their medical records were manually checked for detailed information about serum liver enzymes, anti-HCV antibodies, medical history, and treatments and outcomes of both psoriasis and hepatitis. There were 54 (7.5%) anti-HCV antibody-positive patients among the 717 psoriatic patients detected. Male predominance (male/female ratio, 44:10) and late onset (median age, 55 years) were the characteristics of the 54 patients. HCV infection preceded the onset of psoriasis definitely in 80% and probably in 11%. Interferon therapy exacerbated 70% of pre-existing psoriasis cases, and induced de novo psoriasis in eight patients. Complication with diabetes mellitus was found in 35% of the patients. Our observations suggest that HCV infection can be an inducing factor for psoriasis. In hepatitis C patients, elevated tumor necrosis factor-Œ± is known to cause progression of hepatic disease and possibly induces psoriasis in patients with a certain predisposition."
5026,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is still the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis world wide. Recently, however, there has been quite dramatic improvement in the understanding of HBV associated liver disease and its treatment. It has become clear that high viral replication is a major risk factor for the development of both cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Early studies have shown lamivudine lowers the risk of HBV associated complications. There are currently three nucleos(t)ides licensed, in addition to interferon, and there are more drugs coming to the market soon. Interferon or its pegylated counterpart are still the only options for treatment with defined end points, while nucleos(t)ides therapy is used mostly for long term treatment. Combination therapies have not been shown to be superior to monotherapy in naive patients, however, the outcome depends on how the end point is defined. Interferon plus lamivudine achieves a higher viral suppression than either treatment alone, even though Hbe-seroconversion was not different after a one year treatment. HBV-genotypes emerge as relevant factors, with genotypes ""A"" and ""B"" responding relatively well to interferon, achieving up to 20% HBsAg clearance in the case of genotype ""A"". In addition to having a defined treatment duration, interferon has the advantage of lacking resistance selection, which is a major drawback for lamivudine and the other nucleos(t)ides. The emergence of resistance against adefovir and entecavir is somewhat slower in naive compared to lamivudine resistant patients. Adefovir has a low resistance profile with 3%, 9%, 18%, and 28% after 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, while entecavir has rarely produced resistance in naive patients for up to 3 years."
7937,0.005,1.0000,"Because of the probable role of HIV-infected monocyte/macrophages in the pathogenesis and progression of AIDS, it is essential that antiretroviral therapy address viral replication in cells of this lineage. Several dideoxynucleosides have been shown to have potent in vitro and, in the case of 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), in vivo activity against HIV. However, because these compounds must be phosphorylated (activated) in target cells, and because monocyte/macrophages may have levels of kinases that differ from those in lymphocytes, we investigated the capacity of these drugs to suppress HIV replication in monocyte/macrophages using HIV-1/HTLV-IIIBa-L (a monocytotropic isolate). In the present study, we observed that HTLV-IIIBa-L replication in fresh human peripheral blood monocyte/macrophages was suppressed by each of three dideoxynucleosides: 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), and 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine (ddA). Similar results were observed in 5-d-cultured monocyte/macrophages, although higher concentrations of the drugs were required. We then studied the metabolism of AZT and ddC in such cells. The phosphorylation of ddC to a triphosphate moiety was somewhat decreased in monocyte/macrophages as compared with H9 T cells. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of AZT in monocyte/macrophages was markedly decreased to 25% or less of the level in T cells. However, when we examined the level of the normal endogenous 2'-deoxynucleoside triphosphate pools, which compete with 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside triphosphate for viral reverse transcriptase, we found that the level of 2'-deoxycytidine-triphosphate (dCTP) was six- to eightfold reduced, and that of 2'-deoxythymidine-triphosphate (dTTP) was only a small fraction of that found in T cell lines. These results suggest that the ratio of dideoxynucleoside triphosphate to normal deoxynucleoside triphosphate is a crucial factor in determining the antiviral activity of dideoxynucleosides in HIV target cells, and that the lower levels of dTTP may account for the antiretroviral activity of AZT in the face of inefficient phosphorylation of this compound."

8597,0.005,1.0000,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection leads to AIDS in experimentally infected Rhesus macaques similarly to HIV-infected humans. In contrast, SIV infection of natural hosts is characterized by a down-regulation of innate acute responses to the virus within a few weeks of infection and results in limited pathology. Chloroquine (CQ) has been used in the treatment or prevention of malaria and has recently been shown to cause a decrease of immune activation and CD4 cell loss in HIV-infected individuals treated with antiretroviral therapy. Here, we treated Rhesus macaques with CQ during the acute phase of SIVmac251 infection with the intent to decrease viral-induced immune activation and possibly limit disease progression. Contrary to what was expected, CQ treatment resulted in a temporary increased expression of interferon (IFN)-stimulating genes and it worsened the recovery of CD4(+) T cells in the blood. Our findings confirm recent results observed in asymptomatic HIV-infected patients and suggest that CQ does not provide an obvious benefit in the absence of antiretroviral therapy."
3776,0.005,1.0000,"Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) are the main genes that control cell death in the immune system. Indeed, they are crucial for the regulation of T lymphocyte homeostasis because they can influence cell proliferation. A strong debate exists on the importance of Fas/FasL system during HIV infection, which is characterized by the loss of CD4+ T cells directly, or indirectly, caused by the virus. To investigate whether the genetic background of the host plays a role in the immunoreconstitution, we studied the influence of different Fas and FasL polymorphisms on CD4+ T lymphocyte count and plasma viral load following initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in drug-na√Øve HIV+ patients. We studied 131 individuals, who were compared to 136 healthy donors. Statistical analysis was performed by using Chi2 test, Fischer's Exact Test, and analysis for repeated measurements. The group of HIV+ patients had an unexpected lower frequency of FasLnt169 polymorphism (delT allele) than healthy controls (p = 0.039). We then observed no significant differences in the immune reconstitution, in terms of CD4+ T cell increase, when the influence of single alleles of the gene Fas or FasL was considered. However, the combination of some polymorphisms of Fas or FasL significantly influenced CD4+ T cell production and viral load decrease, showing that these genes can play a role in the immunoreconstitution triggered by antiretroviral therapy."
4421,0.005,1.0000,"It is estimated that approximately 3% of the world population are chronically infected with HCV, as the annual incidence of HCV infection is approximately 3-4 million people. Despite all efforts made to eradicate the HCV infection, after the standard therapy (PegIFN and ribavirin for 48 weeks) only 40-50% of the HCV infected individuals with genotype 1 achieve sustained virological response (SVR). Since our goal today is the eradication of HCV infection, our prior concern has become the identification of predictor factors concerning treatment response. Recent studies such as GWAS have been concerned with the genetic factors and the response to treatment. Recently all interest has been turned towards the demonstration of the host polymorphism located upstream of the IL-28B gene and which is associated with sustained virological response to treatment with pegylated interferon Alfa in combination with ribavirin. Although 2011 comes with the FDA approval of the new triple therapy associating telaprevir/ boceprevir to the standard therapy, a new ethical concern regarding the high costs of this treatment rises the problem of who is the first in line? This is just the beginning of a new quest to further investigate the relationship between the host's polymorphism of the IL-28 gene and the standard and triple therapy in HCV infected individuals in achieving SVR as well as who should receive standard or triple therapy. Determination of the IL-28 polymorphisms may be used together with clinical assessment in order to evaluate patients and to personalize their treatment. The purpose of this paper is to underline the main concerns regarding the goal and endpoints of the HCV therapy, and the relationship of IL-28 in achieving sustained virological response, as well as in pointing out the importance to determine prior to initiating treatment the polymorphism of IL-28 since it is a strong predictor. This is important because it will increase the chances to achieve SVR, it will be cost-effective and reduces adverse effects."
3380,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is characterized by high genetic diversity. Current antiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance genotyping assays have been designed on the basis of the most prevalent sequence patterns circulating in the United States and Europe, which belong to the B subtype. However, little is known about their performance on non-B subtype samples. In Argentina, circulating forms have been characterized as subtypes B, C, F, and B/F recombinant forms. Our aim was to analyze the association between the genetic diversity of HIV-1 forms circulating in Argentina and the lack of reactivity at codon 74 in an ARV drug resistance hybridization-based assay. Samples taken from 93 HIV-1-infected individuals of Buenos Aires, Argentina were studied. The reverse transcriptase (RT) region of HIV-1 was genotypically assessed by a line probe assay (INNO-LiPA HIV-1 RT; Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) and automatic sequencing (TruGene and OpenGene; Visible Genetics, Toronto, Canada). Phylogenetic and intersubtype recombination analyses were carried out, showing that 52 of 93 (55.9%) samples belonged to subtype B, whereas 41 of 93 (44.1%) showed a (5') F1/B (3') subtype recombinant genomic structure. For codon 74 in the LiPA test, 4 of 52 (7.7%) B-subtype samples were nonreactive, whereas 27 of 41 (65.9 %) F1/B recombinant samples showed a nonreacting result, indicating a significant difference in the subtype distribution of the nonreacting samples. The presence of a synonymous polymorphism at codon 72 of RT (AGA --> AGG) associated with the lack of reaction at codon 74 in LiPA, was more prevalent in F1/B subtype recombinant samples (p < 0.001). The present data indicate that HIV-1 genetic diversity is a major obstacle for ARV drug resistance hybridization-based assays."
2227,0.005,1.0000,"In patients living with HIV infection with hepatitis C (HCV) is common. HIV/HCV co-infection results in more rapid liver fibrosis progression than HCV alone and end-stage liver disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in co-infected patients. Historically, treatment outcomes with interferon based therapy in this group have been poor but with the advent of directly acting antiviral (DAA) drugs for HCV, rates of cure have improved dramatically. This article reviews recent evidence on the treatment of HCV in co-infected patients including the efficacy of new regimens and information on drug-drug interactions between DAAs and antiretroviral therapy. We also discuss the relationship between the pathogenesis of HIV and HCV infections, the treatment of acute hepatitis C and the current debate regarding the cost-effectiveness and affordability of DAAs.

2638,0.005,1.0000,"Due to shared routes of transmission, acute and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus is common among persons living with HIV infection in many regions of the world. In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, acute HCV infection has been increasingly recognized in HIV-infected persons, particularly men who have sex with men, and liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma, has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in those with chronic HCV infection, particularly older adults with long-standing coinfection. Over the past decade, the foundation for the management of acute and chronic HCV infection has been interferon alfa. However, due the high burden of treatment-related side effects and low likelihood of sustained virologic response, the impact of treatment with peginterferon/ribavirin on the burden of HCV disease in has been limited. However, the anticipated availability of safe, tolerable and highly efficacious interferon-free, oral HCV direct-acting antiviral combination therapies promise to dramatically change the management of acute and chronic HCV infection in HIV-infected persons. Preliminary data from studies of such oral DAA regimens in HIV/HCV coinfected patients suggest that coinfection with HIV will not impair HCV cure with these regimens. Indeed, in the coming era of high effective oral HCV DAA treatments, the only special feature concerning treatment of acute and chronic HCV infection in HIV-infected patients may be drug interactions between the antiretroviral drugs for HIV infection and direct-acting antiviral drugs for HCV infection."

In this study, we analysed the 8 key mutations in 442 serum samples collected from 310 non-HCC and 132 HCC patients to identify the combinations linked to HCC. After the patients were stratified according to the age groups and mutation combinations, clinical parameters were compared between the HCC and the non-HCC groups. Analyses were focused on patient ‚â•40¬†years of age infected by HBV genotype C with A1762T and G1764A mutations in the basal core promoter region (BCP double mutation). In patients with ‚â•6 mutations, the combination of [G1613A¬†+ C1653T¬†+ A1846T¬†+¬†G1896A] mutations was closely linked to HCC, whereas no specific single or double mutation combination was associated with HCC. In patients with ‚â§5 mutations, HBeAg and HBV DNA serum titres were lower in the HCC group than those in the non-HCC group.

The incidence of HZ in the pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era (17.21 per 100 PY) was significantly higher than that in the post-HAART era (5.05 per 100 PY) (P < 0.0001). In the first six months of enrollment, the incidence of HZ was significantly higher than that between six and 12 months both in the pre-HAART (27.65 per 100 PY versus 8.43 per 100 PY, P = 0.02) and post-HAART era (17.79 per 100 PY versus 3.39 per 100 PY, P < 0.0001). In multivariate analyses, only baseline CD4+ count remained a significant risk factor associated with HZ. HZ did not increase mortality rate either in the pre-HAART or post-HAART era, although the risk for HIV progression was significantly higher in patients with HZ (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.747, 95% confidence interval, 1.037-2.943). We conclude that the incidence of HZ was highest in the first six months of enrollment in patients at late stage of HIV infection, which did not increase with the introduction of HAART. Baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count was the most significant risk factor associated with development of HZ. HZ was associated with increased risk for HIV progression, but not mortality."

Viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples and the gag gene was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR. The PCR product was cloned and three clones from each patient were sequenced. All the sequences were aligned and compared with similar HIV-1 isolated from nontreated AIDS patients. Several kinds of changes were observed in the sequences including substitutions, frameshifts, and deletions. One patient showed a frameshift due to a missing G residue in the capsid-encoding region of the gene whereas another patient had virus with two different deletions. Such changes are probably due to combination therapy."

However, aging and the long term use of HIV medications have led to an increased incidence of chronic, non-HIV-related illnesses.

Out of an estimated 459,909 illegal immigrants in our country, 2,700 to 4,600 are probably infected with HIV; 1,800 to 3,220 know that they are infected, and 80% of the latter could receive antiretroviral treatment. The Royal Decree-Law is likely to cause many undesirable consequences in this population infected with HIV: increasing mortality, promoting the emergence of opportunistic diseases, increasing hospital admissions, increasing infections in the population (by HIV and other pathogens), or contributing to mother to child transmission of HIV. The expected increase in morbidity and mortality will be a greater cost in patient care, a cost which will be significantly higher in the more immunosuppressed patients. Therefore, the enforcement of the Royal Decree-Law will be much less cost-effective in the short term than was expected, and will negatively affect our country's public health, especially for those patients infected with HIV who will not be covered, thus increasing healthcare medium to long term costs, and moving away from the international health goals that were established."

HIV infected patients are living longer owing to advances in antiretroviral therapy and treatment of prophylaxis against opportunistic infections but because of their immunodeficiency they are at high risk of cancers, especially NHL. The natural history of cancers in patients with HIV infection differs from that of the general population. Unusual aspects of tumor localization, growth behaviour and therapeutical response, distinguish tumors in patients with from those without HIV infection. The pathologic and virological aspects of HIV-related tumors are peculiar and a pathological classification of HIV associated systemic lymphomas based on the morphological features of the two main types, i.e. blastic and anaplastic cell lymphomas has been formulated. The treatment of HIV-related neoplasms is controversial as it is not clear whether conventional therapy and in particular chemotherapy is able to modify the natural history of these malignancies in HIV setting. Moreover the treatment of HIV-related tumors presents several problems, due to the aggressive behaviours of tumors and because of immunosuppressive chemotherapy employed in patients with immunodeficiency."

Behavioral interventions that target high-risk behavior associated with HCV transmission and treatment with direct-acting antivirals may prevent further HCV infections. We predicted the effect of behavioral and treatment interventions on HCV incidence and prevalence among HIV-infected men who have sex with men up to 2030 using a HCV transmission model parameterized with data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. We assessed behavioral interventions associated with further increase, stabilization, and decrease in the size of the population with high-risk behavior. Treatment interventions included increase in treatment uptake and use of direct-acting antivirals. If we assumed that without behavioral interventions high-risk behavior spread further according to the trends observed over the last decade and that the treatment practice did not change, HCV incidence converged to 10.7/100 person-years. All assessed behavioral interventions alone resulted in reduced HCV transmissions. Stabilization of high-risk behavior combined with increased treatment uptake and the use of direct-acting antivirals reduced incidence by 77% (from 2.2 in 2015 to 0.5/100 person-years) and prevalence by 81% (from 4.8% in 2015 to 0.9%) over the next 15 years. Increasing treatment uptake was more effective than increasing treatment efficacy to reduce HCV incidence and prevalence. A decrease in high-risk behavior led to a rapid decline in HCV incidence, independent of treatment interventions."
5576,0.005,1.0000,"In order to define more accurately human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients at risk of developing toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE), we assessed the prognostic significance of the anti-Toxoplasma gondii immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoblot profile, in addition to AIDS stage, a CD4(+) cell count <50/mm(3), and an antibody titer > or =150 IU/ml, in patients with CD4 cell counts <200/mm(3) and seropositive for T. gondii. Baseline serum samples from 152 patients included in the placebo arm of the ANRS 005-ACTG 154 trial (pyrimethamine versus placebo) were used. The IgG immunoblot profile was determined using a Toxoplasma lysate and read using the Kodak Digital Science 1D image analysis software. Mean follow-up was 15.1 months, and the 1-year incidence of TE was 15.9%. The cumulative probability of TE varied according to the type and number of anti-T. gondii IgG bands and reached 65% at 12 months for patients with IgG bands of 25 and 22 kDa. In a Cox model adjusted for age, gender, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clinical stage, and CD4 and CD8 cell counts, the incidence of TE was higher when the IgG 22-kDa band (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.4; P < 0.001), the IgG 25-kDa band (HR = 4.7; P < 0.001), or the IgG 69-kDa band (HR = 3.4; P < 0.001) was present and was higher for patients at CDC stage C (HR = 4.9; P < 0.001). T. gondii antibody titer and CD4 cell count were not predictive of TE. Thus, detection of IgG bands of 25, 22, and/or 69 kDa may be helpful for deciding when primary prophylaxis for TE should be started or discontinued, especially in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy."

The LTNP were compared with patients in the early phase of infection and patients who had progressed to advanced immunodeficiency. Changes in CD8(+) subset distribution were observed mainly at acquisition of HIV-1 infection, whereas CD4(+) subset changes appeared during progression of HIV-1 infection. The decreasing levels of CD4(+) cells were characterized by an increasing frequency of cells expressing the activation markers HLA-Dr and CD45RO but not the CD28 surface antigen. The LTNP exhibited significant changes compared to HIV-negative patients in almost all markers. Compared to patients in the early phase of infection, the only difference was a relatively lower frequency of CD4(+) cells expressing CD26 among the LTNP. The results show that HIV-1-infected persons who have no signs of immunodeficiency despite many years of infection have an immunophenotypic pattern that is substantially different from that of noninfected persons. Despite the long duration of infection, the LTNP exhibit a pattern similar to that of newly infected persons, with the exception of lower expression of CD26 on CD4(+) cells."

Even in ARV treated individuals there is a concern that the prolonged survival of many HIV-1 carriers is likely to eventually result in an increased number of malignancies diagnosed. Malignancies that were found to have high incidence in HIV-infected individuals are Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The incidence of NHL has increased nearly 200 fold in HIV-positive patients, and accounts for a greater percentage of AIDS defining illness in the US and Europe since the advent of HAART therapy. These AIDS related lymphomas are distinct from their counterparts seen in HIV-1 seronegative patients. For example nearly half of all cases of ARL are associated with the presence of a gamma herpesvirus, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) or human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8)/ Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV). The pathogenesis of ARLs is complex. B-cell proliferation driven by chronic antigenemia resulting in the induction of polyclonal and ultimately monoclonal lymphoproliferation may occur in the setting of severe immunosuppression."
6495,0.005,1.0000,"Although myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are well known for their immunosuppressive function in several pathological conditions, the role of MDSCs in hepatitis B virus infection remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the frequency and function of MDSCs in the peripheral blood and liver of 91 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. A higher percentage of MDSCs, defined as CD14(+)HLA-DR(-/low), was detected in peripheral blood of CHB patients than that of the healthy controls. Moreover, high expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and secretion of IL-10 in this population were determined. The frequency of MDSCs was positively correlated with serum viral load, but it was negatively correlated with liver inflammatory injury. These cells were also abundant in liver tissue of CHB patients and were related to necroinflammatory activity. Furthermore, we found that these cells could suppress hepatitis B virus-specific CD8(+) T cell response, including reduced proliferation and IFN-Œ≥ production, and inhibit degranulation of CD8(+) T cells, including reduced production of granzyme B and perforin. Importantly, PD-1-induced IL-10 production by MDSCs was responsible for the suppressive activity. To our knowledge, for the first time our study proved that CD14(+)HLA-DR(-/low)PD-1(+) MDSCs in CHB patients contribute to an inadequate immune response against the virus and lead to chronic infection, which represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

4441,0.005,1.0000,"Coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with an accelerated course of HCV infection and a faster progression to severe liver disease. We have investigated whether the development of liver disease in coinfected patients is associated with specific chemokine and cytokine production. Four cohorts--HCV/HIV-coinfected patients, HCV-monoinfected patients, HIV-monoinfected patients, and healthy control subjects--were studied. Serum levels of the 10-kDa interferon- gamma -inducible protein (IP-10) were higher in all 3 groups of infected patients than in control subjects (P<.0001). HCV/HIV-coinfected patients had significantly higher IP-10 levels than monoinfected patients. In HCV-monoinfected patients, liver fibrosis scores and liver enzyme levels were positively correlated with IP-10 levels. Elevated IP-10 levels are associated with and may contribute to liver damage in both HCV-monoinfected and HCV/HIV-coinfected patients."
8157,0.005,1.0000,"In this study we investigated the distribution of the S6F1 antigen, an epitope of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen, on CD8+ T lymphocytes in a series of 15 HIV-1+ and 20 HIV-1- haemophiliac patients. MoAbs recognizing the S6F1 antigen have been claimed to distinguish between killer effectors (brightly S6F1+ stained) and suppressor cells (dimly S6F1+ stained) within the CD8+ lymphoid population. In addition, we tried to find a correlation between the spontaneous in vitro immunoglobulin synthesis from patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes and the pattern of S6F1 expression. Although the total number of double-positive CD8+/S6F1+ cells was similar in both HIV-1+ and HIV-1- haemophiliac patients, a significant increase in the CD8+/S6F1+ population bright versus dim was documented in HIV-1-infected with respect to HIV-1- haemophiliacs (bright/dim ratio 3.97 +/- 0.61 versus 0.75 +/- 0.1, respectively, P < 0.005). This finding was correlated to a significant increase in spontaneous in vitro immunoglobulin production in HIV-1+ subjects compared with control haemophiliacs (P < 0.005). Purified CD8+ lymphocytes from HIV-1+ subjects showed a reduced suppressor activity on mitogen-induced immunoglobulin production. Taken together, these data suggest that HIV-1 infection favours the generation of CD8+/S6F1+ bright cells with putative cytotoxic-associated function, leading to a progressive reduction in the number of CD8+/S6F1+ dim suppressor lymphocytes. This phenomenon may contribute to the polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia present in HIV-1+ haemophiliac patients."
3675,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is associated with a higher prevalence of insulin resistance compared to the general population. This finding is associated with hepatic steatosis, increased liver fibrosis and lower rates of sustained virological response to interferon based therapy. The relationship of insulin resistance and HCV genotype is controversial. Our aim was to compare the prevalence of insulin resistance between patients with HCV genotype 1 and 3. The association of insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis was also investigated."

We investigated one specific type of NKT cell, Valpha24/Vbeta11 double positive, in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Lower frequencies of this population were detected in the blood of HCV PCR-positive patients than in controls. Unlike Valpha24/Vbeta11 NKT cells found in blood, those in the liver appeared to be recently activated."
1724,0.005,1.0000,"In order to evaluate the potential risk of nelfinavir (NFV) accumulation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients with liver disease, we investigated the concentrations of NFV and M8, the active metabolite of NFV, in plasma HIV-positive (HIV+) patients coinfected with HCV. A total of 119 HIV+ subjects were included in our study: 67 HIV+ patients, 32 HIV+ and HCV-positive (HCV+) patients without cirrhosis, and 20 HIV+ and HCV+ patients with cirrhosis. Most of the enrolled patients (chronically treated) were taking NFV at the standard dosage of 1,250 mg twice a day. To assay plasma NFV and M8 concentrations, patients underwent serial plasma samplings during the dosing interval at steady state. Plasma NFV and M8 concentrations were measured simultaneously by a high-performance liquid chromatography method with UV detection. The HIV+ and HCV+ patients with and without cirrhosis had significantly lower NFV oral clearances than the HIV+ and HCV-negative individuals (28 and 58% lower, respectively; P < 0.05), which translated into higher areas under the concentration-time curves for cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. The NFV absorption rate was significantly lower in cirrhotic patients, resulting in a longer time to the maximum concentration in serum. The mean ratios of the M8 concentration/NFV concentration were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in HIV+ and HCV+ subjects with cirrhosis (0.06 +/- 0.074) than in the subjects in the other two groups. The mean ratios for M8 and NFV were not statistically different between HIV+ and HCV-negative patients (0.16 +/- 0.13) and HIV+ and HCV+ patients without cirrhosis (0.24 +/- 0.17), but the interpatient variability was high. Our results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of NFV and M8 are altered in HIV+ and HCV+ patients, especially those with liver cirrhosis. Therefore, there may be a role for therapeutic drug monitoring in individualizing the NFV dosage in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients."
1956,0.005,1.0000,"Accurate determination of plasma human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels is critical for the effective management of HIV-1 disease. The AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Test, a reverse transcription-PCR-based test for quantification of HIV-1 RNA in plasma, was developed when little sequence information on HIV-1 isolates from outside North America was available. It has since become apparent that many non-subtype B isolates, particularly subtypes A and E, are detected inefficiently by the test. We describe here the AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Test, version 1.5, an upgraded test developed to minimize subtype-related variation. We also developed a panel of HIV-1 standards containing 30 HIV-1 isolates of subtypes A through G. The virus particle concentration of each cultured viral stock was standardized by electron microscopic virus particle counting. We used this panel to determine the performance of the original AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Test and version 1.5 of the test with HIV-1 subtypes A through G. The original test underestimated the concentration of HIV-1 subtype A, E, F, and G RNA by 10-fold or more, whereas version of the 1.5 test yielded equivalent quantification of HIV-1 RNA regardless of the subtype. In light of the increasing intermixing of HIV-1 subtypes worldwide, standardization of PCR-based tests against well-characterized viral isolates representing the full range of HIV-1 diversity will be essential for the continued utility of these important clinical management tools."
9081,0.005,1.0000,"High level adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is required to achieve and maintain suppression of HIV replication. Although directly observed therapy (DOT) has been suggested as an intervention to improve adherence, there is a paucity of data describing the attitudes and beliefs regarding DOT for ART among HIV-infected individuals. This study was designed to evaluate the acceptability and psychometric properties of a survey instrument for use in assessing barriers and facilitators of adherence to ART DOT in prison. From July 1, 1999 to April 1, 2000, we piloted an interviewer-administered questionnaire to assess health beliefs and attitudes regarding HIV treatment among 65 HIV-infected prison inmates receiving one or more of their antiretrovirals via directly observed therapy (DOT). The first 24 participants were administered the questionnaire to determine the feasibility of surveying prisoners in a correctional setting. There were no adherence data collected on these participants. The remaining 41 participants had their adherence measured in addition to receiving the questionnaire. Thirty-one were included in the final analysis because 10 did not complete the study. Multiple antiretroviral adherence measures (electronic device medication monitoring [eDEM] caps, medication administration records [MARs], and pill counts) were assessed among a subset of the participants (n = 31) and correlated to the instrument response items. The median internal consistency reliability coefficient for the multi-item scales was 0.79. The strongest correlation between inmates' beliefs and their adherence was between ""positive beliefs about protease inhibitors"" and the MAR adherence measure (r = 0.72; p < 0.001). This study provides preliminary support for the psychometric properties of the survey in this correctional setting."
1938,0.005,1.0000,"We examined the ability of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) to infect in vitro, primary brain-derived human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) that constitute the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Immunofluorescence (IFA) and antigen capture assays failed to demonstrate p24 antigen from HIV inoculated endothelial cells and supernatants did not contain detectable levels of reverse transcriptase (RT). HIV could be rescued by cocultivation of infected HMEC with a susceptible T-lymphocyte line (CEM-SS), which were then shown to form syncytia and produce RT activity and p24 Ag (IFA, antigen captive assay). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was successfully used to amplify HIV-specific gag and env gene sequences from HMEC. CD4 expression was not identified on these cells by IFA. These results suggest that HIV infection of BBB endothelium occurs, but that viral replication is minimal. Infection of the BBB by HIV may give the virus a foothold in the CNS and suggests that the brain might be infected directly and may not be limited to just the passage of infected mononuclear cells."
6475,0.005,1.0000,"Health care workers are exposed daily to blood borne injury and infection with a high risk of hepatitis B or C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. In the 1980s, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a set of protocols and guidelines known as standard precautions (SP) to prevent accidental transmission of pathogens. The SP should be followed for each intervention or delivery of care in order to protect health care workers from risks associated with contact with blood and other biological liquids. A survey was conducted in a Western Algerian university hospital to assess nurses' adherence to SP practices. A questionnaire was administered to 450 nurses in the hospital workplace setting. A field survey was also conducted in order to take into account the means and support available to the nurses in these hospital departments, namely to determine availability of hand washing and drying facilities. A total of 133 nurses, 81 women and 52 men, participated in the survey. Personal and professional data, hand-washing frequency, glove wearing practices were collected as data. A large majority (95%) of nurses reported washing their hands after removing their gloves, and 69% of them reported washing their hands between two patients. Male nurses wear gloves more often than females (respectively 77% and 53%). Sharp instruments were correctly disposed of in a puncture-resistant container more of the time. Recapping needles has been reported by two-thirds of survey respondents. Lack of liquid soap and alcohol-based washing solution were noted as major deficiencies as well as the lack of means to properly dry hands in many health care wards. Lack of SP adherence is primarily due to the lack of awareness and knowledge as well as insufficient supply of equipment and materials for good hand hygiene maintenance. This study highlights the urgent need to implement a programme to improve SP adherence among nurses and to increase the supply of hand washing and drying materials. Greater adherence to SP practices will also reduce the risk of occupational exposure to blood borne injury and infection."
4991,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this article is to describe the psychosocial factors associated with alcohol and/or drug (AOD) use among HIV-infected individuals. Their attitudes toward AOD use are also examined. Three hundred and three HIV-infected adults completed a survey on AOD use while waiting for their appointment at the largest, HIV-outpatient clinic in the Gulf South. Logistic regression showed that associating with others who use drugs and hospitalization for a mental illness were associated with current AOD use. Variables derived from the AIDS Risk Reduction Model that integrates elements of the Health Belief Model, efficacy theory, and social network theory, indicated that 14% of the sample admitted to having an AOD problem. Twenty-six percent of the AOD users reported that they have little social support to help them stop their AOD use. A disturbing finding was that 24% of the AOD users have actively sought help or treatment for their AOD problem and have not been able to find help. These patients differ significantly from the AOD users who could find help in that they are primarily African-American and 46% have been hospitalized for a mental illness. Motivational strategies and mental health interventions are necessary, which provide peer counseling and social support, factors that have been found to greatly influence behavior change. The intervention may also need to include spiritual and humor components because the vast majority of AOD users are interested in treatment approaches that include these two elements."
4374,0.005,1.0000,"In order to analyze the nutritional status of HIV infected patients and the involvement of the tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and its soluble receptors (sTNFRI and sTNFRII) in such an status, forty HIV infected patients, with no associated systemic opportunist infections, were prospectively followed for eight months. From each patient the following were obtained: clinical history, dietetic survey, anthropometric measurements, CD4+ T lymphocyte/mm3 count, HIV load, and serum concentration of TNF and sTNFRI and sTNFRII. Patients showed a nutritional disorder which involved mainly the fat compartment (mean tricipital skin fold 9.8 +/- 4.2 mm, that is, 65.7 +/- 27.4% of the ideal fold), associated with a hypocaloric intake (mean daily intake 1,659.5 +/- 543.0 kcal), with normal proportions of the different organic principles. Serum concentrations of TNF (87.9 +/- 79.2 vs 8.7 +/- 6.1 pg/ml, p = 0.048) and its receptors, sTNFRI (6.1 +/- 2.6 vs 1.0 +/- 0.8 pg/ml, p < 0.001) and sTNFRII (41.9 +/- 18.6 vs 6.3 +/- 3.6 pg/ml, p < 0.001) were significantly higher than those detected in a sample of ten healthy controls. No correlation was found between nutritional alterations and concentrations of TNF or its receptors, viral load, and counts of CD4+ T lymphocytes/mm3. Seventeen patients completed the follow-up period. During this period, no significant modifications in the analyzed parameters were observed: tricipital skin fold, arm circumference, serum concentrations of albumin or transferrin, concentrations of tumoral necrosis factor or its receptor and caloric intake. The conclusion is that, despite the detected nutritional alterations in the nutritional status and those in the TNF/receptor system, our data no support and interrelationship between them."
8764,0.005,1.0000,"All classes of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy have been associated with asymptomatic elevations of alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) levels, and much less frequently with serious, and at times life threatening, clinical liver hepatotoxicity. The relationship between the risk of developing serious clinical liver injury and the rate and severity of elevated asymptomatic ALT/AST levels is poorly understood. Boehringer Ingelheim has recently completed the Viramune Hepatic Safety Project; its primary objective was to identify risk factors for antiretroviral-associated hepatotoxicity. Data from 1731 nevirapine-treated patients and 1912 control patients who took part in Boehringer Ingelheim-controlled clinical trials as well as 814 nevirapine-treated patients in uncontrolled trials were analyzed. Risk factors for asymptomatic ALT/AST elevations during nevirapine therapy included baseline elevations of ALT/AST levels > 2.5x upper limit of normal (RR = 4.3, p < .01) and co-infection with hepatitis B (RR = 2.3, p < .01) or hepatitis C (RR = 5.2, p < .01). An analysis of ALT/AST elevations > 5x ULN for patients stratified by baseline CD4 cell count demonstrated that men with > or = 400 CD4 cells/mm3 were at increased risk of asymptomatic transaminase elevations while taking nevirapine (RR = 1.6, p < .01). No consistent CD4 cell count cutoff could be identified in women that was associated with an increased risk of ALT/AST elevations. Analyses from five large observational cohorts (N = 8711) demonstrated no significant differences in the rate of serious hepatic events among antiretroviral regimens, including between the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nevirapine and efavirenz. Use of nevirapine was not associated with a significantly increased risk of clinical hepatotoxic events, including liver failure or liver related death, compared to therapy with other antiretroviral drugs."

We describe two patients of spontaneous fungal peritonitis where the isolate was Cryptococcus neoformans. Both cases suffered from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The clinical and laboratory profiles of both patients were similar to those of conventional spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We suggest that it would be prudent to heighten clinical suspicion for fungal peritonitis in such cases."
3490,0.005,1.0000,"Viral quasispecies analysis is important for basic and clinical research. This study was designed to detect hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome-wide mutation profiling with detailed variant composition in individual patients, especially quasispecies evolution correlating with liver disease progression. We characterized viral populations by massively parallel pyrosequencing at whole HBV genome level in 17 patients with advanced liver disease (ALD) and 30 chronic carriers (CC). An average sequencing coverage of 2047√ó and 687√ó in ALD and CC groups, respectively, were achieved. Deep sequencing data resolved the landscapes of HBV substitutions and a more complicated quasispecies composition than previously observed. The values of substitution frequencies in quasispecies were clustered as either more than 80% or less than 20%, forming a unique U-shaped distribution pattern in both clinical groups. Furthermore, quantitative comparison of mutation frequencies of each site between two groups resulted in a spectrum of substitutions associated with liver disease progression, and among which, C2288A/T, C2304A, and A/G2525C/T were novel candidates. Moreover, distinct deletion patterns in preS, X, and C regions were shown between the two groups. In conclusion, pyrosequencing of the whole HBV genome revealed a panorama of viral quasispecies composition, characteristics of substitution distribution, and mutations correlating to severe liver disease.

661,0.005,1.0000,"Seven hundred and four HIV-1/2-positive, antiretroviral therapy (ART) na√Øve patients were screened for HTLV-1 infection. Antibodies to HTLV-1 were found in 32/704 (4.5%) of the patients. Each co-infected individual was matched with two HIV mono-infected patients according to World Health Organization clinical stage, age +/-5 years and gender. Key clinical and laboratory characteristics were compared between the two groups. Mono-infected and co-infected patients displayed similar clinical characteristics. However, co-infected patients had higher absolute CD4+ T-cell counts (P = 0.001), higher percentage CD4+ T-cell counts (P < 0.001) and higher CD4/CD8 ratios (P < 0.001). Although HIV plasma RNA viral loads were inversely correlated with CD4+ T-cell-counts in mono-infected patients (P < 0.0001), a correlation was not found in co-infected individuals (P = 0.11). Patients with untreated HIV and HTLV-1 co-infection show a dissociation between immunological and HIV virological markers. Current recommendations for initiating ART and chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections in resource-poor settings rely on more readily available CD4+ T-cell counts without viral load parameters. These guidelines are not appropriate for co-infected individuals in whom high CD4+ T-cell counts persist despite high HIV viral load states. Thus, for co-infected patients, even in resource-poor settings, HIV viral loads are likely to contribute information crucial for the appropriate timing of ART introduction."
7526,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the esophagus has recently been implicated as a cause of giant esophageal ulcers in HIV-positive patients with odynophagia. The authors examined four patients in whom esophagograms (one single-contrast and three double-contrast studies) revealed giant, HIV-related ulcers indistinguishable from those of cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis. All four patients had severe odynophagia, one had an associated maculopapular rash, and two became HIV-positive at approximately the time of clinical presentation. In all patients, biopsy samples, brushings, and cultures obtained with endoscopy were negative for CMV or herpes simplex. One patient had positive brushings for candidiasis, but this may have resulted from fungal superinfection of the ulcer. Two patients were treated with orally administered steroids, and all four had swift clinical improvement; symptoms disappeared during an average period of 8.3 days from presentation. HIV-related esophageal ulcers should be distinguished from CMV ulcers, so that appropriate treatment can be initiated in these patients."

A 2-year prospective study used serial ELISA, two types of Western blot, immunologic profiles, HIV-1 culture, and analysis by polymerase chain reaction. Subjects were 20 ELISA-negative, Western blot indeterminate homosexual volunteers and 20 matched seronegative controls. Results showed that 19 of 20 study subjects completed a mean of 17.0 months of clinical and laboratory follow-up. Reactivities with p24 and/or with p55 were the two most commonly observed Western blot patterns, occurring in 70% of individuals. Specific Western blot reactivity was dependent upon the particular immunoblot preparation being used and varied considerably on a longitudinal basis. No individual pattern appeared predictive of an increased likelihood of subsequent seroconversion to HIV-1 relative to controls. By all other criteria including polymerase chain reaction analysis, samples from 17 of 19 individuals remained negative for HIV-1 at each time point. Two individuals evolved from an indeterminate to a positive Western blot and, simultaneously, from a negative to a positive polymerase chain reaction analysis, during follow-up. Our conclusions were as follows. ELISA-negative, Western blot-indeterminate individuals from a high-risk group show marked variability in immunoblot findings over time, and these patterns do not appear predictive of an increased likelihood of infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The overall HPV prevalence in HIV-infected men was 27.5% compared with 12.6% in controls (P < 0.01). Infections with high-risk and multiple HPV genotypes were present in both groups. Differences were not statistically significant. A multivariate logistic regression model showed a decreased HPV prevalence associated with use of a nucleoside and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor combination (P = 0.03). A trend was observed towards a higher HPV prevalence and a lower CD4 cell count. Further prospective studies are needed to determine the role of HPV DNA testing in urine in future screening programmes for anal cancer in men."
4949,0.005,1.0000,"Since the introduction of antiviral compounds such as lamivudine and famciclovir in the treatment schedules of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the accumulation of a variety of mutations in the HBV polymerase gene has been observed. The selection of these mutations is generally considered the cause of viral nonresponsiveness and treatment failure. Therefore, the detection of these mutations is of clinical importance. Previously genotyped HBV strains isolated from treated and untreated patients were amplified with primers specific for the HBV polymerase region from amino acids 465 to 562. Amplified products were cloned into plasmid vectors. The clones were used as reference strains. A set of 38 highly specific oligonucleotide probes covering three different codon positions, L528M, M552V/I, and V/L/M555I, were selected. These probes were applied as 19 different lines on a membrane strip. The strips were then hybridized with PCR fragments from the reference panel, revealing the amino acids at the three codon positions simultaneously for each clone. PCR products generated from two patients infected with HBV genotypes A and C, respectively, and treated with nucleoside analogs were analyzed on these strips. A gradual increase in genetic HBV polymerase complexity was observed in follow-up samples compared to that in pretreatment samples. Additional analysis of HBV polymerase DNA fragments in recombinant plasmid clones demonstrated the existence of (i) clones with double mutations, (ii) clones with single mutations at either codon 528, 552, or 555, and (iii) the simultaneous occurrence of two or more viral populations within one sample. This line probe assay detected the complex quasispecies nature of HBV and provided some insight into the dynamics of resistance mutations."

PCR amplification of the HIV-1 DNA is performed in the presence of an internal quantitation standard, and colorimetric detection of the amplified product is performed with microwell plates. The copies of HIV-1 DNA are normalized to total genomic DNA input. The assay has an analytical sensitivity of 10 input copies per amplification reaction and a three-log detection range. In an analysis of sequential samples from patients on combination therapy, HIV-1 DNA was quantifiable for all individuals tested, including those with undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA. In a separate study, a comparison of HIV-1 DNA levels was made with a group of long-term survivors and progressors. The mean HIV-1 DNA levels were lower in the long-term survivors than in the progressors (P, 0.04). The mean HIV-1 RNA levels were also lower, but the difference was not statistically significant (P, 0.164). A quantitative DNA assay will provide an additional tool to gain insight into the natural history of infection and the continued efficacy of potent antiretroviral therapies."
7876,0.005,1.0000,"A distinct clinical syndrome of cholestasis and hepatitis occurred during early infancy in seven infants with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection. In five infants hepatitis was the first manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection. The median age of onset of hepatitis was 7 months (range, 5 to 10 months). The mean total bilirubin concentration at presentation was 7.4 mg/dl (range, 3.9 to 11 mg/dl), the mean aspartate aminotransferase was 1512 IU/liter (range, 782 to 2960 IU/liter) and the mean alanine amino-transferase 512 IU/liter (range, 92 to 1247 IU/liter). The absolute CD4 count at the time of onset of hepatitis ranged from 191 to 2298 cells/mm3 (mean, 766 cells/mm3). Six of the seven children died within 12 weeks of onset of hepatitis, three as a result of complications of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and two died of complications secondary to cytomegalovirus. In only one infant was the cause of death the direct consequence of liver failure. The seventh infant died 17 months after the onset of hepatitis of dilated cardiomyopathy. No specific etiologic agent has been identified as the cause of cholestatic hepatitis in these infants.

The isolates were initially identified by the Vitek 2 yeast identification system, positive germ tube test, production of rough colonies and chlamydospores on Staib agar and by their inability to assimilate xylose, trehalose or methyl alpha-D-glucoside. The species identity of the isolates was subsequently confirmed by specific amplification of rDNA targeting the internally transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2), restriction endonuclease digestion of the amplified DNA and direct DNA sequencing of the ITS2. Using the E-test method, the MICs of C. dubliniensis test isolates were in the range 0.125-0.75 microg ml(-1) for fluconazole, 0.002-0.75 microg ml(-1) for itraconazole, 0.006-0.125 microg ml(-1) for ketoconazole, 0.002-0.5 microg ml(-1) for amphotericin B and 0.002-0.016 microg ml(-1) for voriconazole. Two of the isolates were resistant to 5-flucytosine (>32 microg ml(-1)), but none against fluconazole. The study reinforces the current view that C. dubliniensis has a much wider geographical and epidemiological distribution."
1916,0.005,1.0000,"Entecavir (ETV) is a potent antiviral nucleoside analogue that is used to treat hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that ETV is also active against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Unlike all approved nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase RT) inhibitors (NRTIs), ETV contains a 3'-hydroxyl group that allows further nucleotide incorporation events to occur. Thus, the mechanism of inhibition probably differs from classic chain termination. Here, we show that the incorporated ETV-monophosphate (MP) can interfere with three distinct stages of DNA synthesis. First, incorporation of the next nucleotide at position n + 1 following ETV-MP is compromised, although DNA synthesis eventually continues. Second, strong pausing at position n + 3 suggests a long range effect, referred to as ""delayed chain-termination."" Third, the incorporated ETV-MP can also act as a ""base pair confounder"" during synthesis of the second DNA strand, when the RT enzyme needs to pass the inhibitor in the template. Enzyme kinetics revealed that delayed chain termination is the dominant mechanism of action. High resolution foot-printing experiments suggest that the incorporated ETV-MP ""repels"" the 3'-end of the primer from the active site of HIV-1 RT, which, in turn, diminishes incorporation of the natural nucleotide substrate at position n + 4. Most importantly, delayed chain termination protects ETV-MP from phosphorolytic excision, which represents a major resistance mechanism for approved NRTIs. Collectively, these findings provide a rationale and important tools for the development of novel, more potent delayed chain terminators as anti-HIV agents."
5464,0.005,1.0000,"DNA sequences encoding the C2 to V3 region of envelope glycoprotein gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were amplified by PCR from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 24 of 25 HIV-1-seropositive patients from Cyprus. By using a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA), all amplified products were studied genetically and compared with 16 previously characterized HIV-1 strains belonging to subtypes A through F. HMA results revealed that HIV-1 gp120 sequences from 15 of our patients were of subtype B of HIV-1, whereas one isolate was of subtype C. However, gp120 sequences from eight patients had no obvious similarities to the known subtypes as defined by HMA. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of molecular clones confirmed the HMA results and placed the eight undefined HIV-1 isolates into three distinct genetic clusters. On the basis of branch topology and lengths of the phylogenetic tree, we conclude that one group consisting of three clones from two patients represents a new HIV-1 env subtype, which we have termed subtype I. The remaining two sequence clusters, consisting of five sequences from four patients and two sequences from two other patients, are distally related to subtypes A and F. These data demonstrate the extensive heterogeneity of HIV-1 in Cyprus, including the presence of new subtype."
2192,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are thought to play a major role in the immune response to HIV infection. The HIV-specific CTL response is much stronger than previously documented in an infectious disease, yet estimates of CTL frequency derived from limiting-dilution analysis (LDA) are relatively low and comparable to other viral infections. Here we show that individual CTL clones specific for peptides from HIV gag and pol gene products are present at high levels in the peripheral blood of three infected patients and that individual CTL clones may represent between 0.2% and 1% of T cells. Previous LDA in one donor had shown a frequency of CTL precursors of 1/8000, suggesting that LDA may underestimate CTL effector frequency. In some donors individual CTL clones persisted in vivo for at least 5 years. In contrast, in one patient there was a switch in CTL usage suggesting that different populations of CTLs can be recruited during infection. These data imply strong stimulation of CTLs, potentially leading some clones to exhaustion."
2401,0.005,1.0000,"nef alleles derived from a large number of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were analyzed to investigate the frequency of disrupted nef genes and to elucidate whether specific amino acid substitutions in Nef are associated with different stages of disease. We confirm that deletions or gross abnormalities in nef are rarely present. However, a comparison of Nef consensus sequences derived from 41 long-term nonprogressors and from 50 individuals with progressive HIV-1 infection revealed that specific variations are associated with different stages of infection. Five amino acid variations in Nef (T15, N51, H102, L170, and E182) were more frequently observed among nonprogressors, while nine features (an additional N-terminal PxxP motif, A15, R39, T51, T157, C163, N169, Q170, and M182) were more frequently found in progressors. Strong correlations between the frequency of these variations in Nef and both the CD4(+)-cell count and the viral load were observed. Moreover, analysis of sequential samples obtained from two progressors revealed that several variations in Nef, which were more commonly observed in patients with low CD4(+)-T-cell counts, were detected only during or after progression to immunodeficiency. Our results indicate that sequence variations in Nef are associated with different stages of HIV-1 infection and suggest a link between nef gene function and the immune status of the infected individual."
5326,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) carries virus-encoded and host-derived proteins. Recent advances in the functional characterization of host molecules inserted into mature virus particles have revealed that HIV-1 biology is influenced by the acquisition of host cell membrane components. The CD28/B7 receptor/ligand system is considered one of the fundamental elements of the normal immune response. Two major cell types that harbor HIV-1 in vivo, i.e., monocytes/macrophages and CD4+ T cells, express the costimulatory molecules CD80 (B7.1) and CD86 (B7.2). We investigated whether CD80 and CD86 are efficiently acquired by HIV-1, and if so, whether these host-encoded molecules can contribute to the virus life cycle. Here we provide the first evidence that the insertion of CD80 and CD86 into HIV-1 increases virus infectivity by facilitating the attachment and entry process due to interactions with their two natural ligands, CD28 and CTLA-4. Moreover, we demonstrate that NF-kappaB is induced by CD80- and CD86-bearing virions when they are combined with the engagement of the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex, an event that is inhibited upon surface expression of CTLA-4. Finally, both CD80 and CD86 were found to be efficiently incorporated into R5- and X4-tropic field strains of HIV-1 expanded in cytokine-treated macrophages. Thus, besides direct interactions between the virus envelope glycoproteins and cell surface constituents, such as CD4 and some specific chemokine coreceptors, HIV-1 may attach to target cells via interactions between cell-derived molecules incorporated into virions and their natural ligands. These findings support the theory that HIV-1-associated host proteins alter virus-host dynamics."
1488,0.005,1.0000,"We have used computer-assisted cytokine ELISA spot analysis to measure the frequencies, the type of cytokine, and the amount of cytokine produced by individual recall Ag-specific CD4 memory cells in freshly isolated blood. We studied the memory cells specific for tetanus toxoid and purified protein derivative in 18 healthy individuals and in 22 HIV-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In healthy individuals, the frequency, cytokine signature, and cytokine production per cell of these memory cells were stable over time. Although it is presently unclear whether the maintenance of the memory T cell pool depends upon Ag persistence, cross-reactive Ag stimulation, or cytokine-driven bystander stimulations and expansions, our data strongly argue for a stable memory cell pool in healthy individuals. In HIV patients, however, the frequency of these memory cells was a function of the viral load. The decreased numbers of functional memory cells in patients with high viral loads might provide one mechanism behind the immunodeficient state. Although the cytokine output per cell was unaffected in most patients (20 of 24), in some patients (4 of 24) it was >100-fold reduced, which might provide an additional mechanism to account for the reduced immunocompetence of these patients. The ability to visualize directly and quantify the cytokine produced by the low frequency memory cells in freshly isolated blood that have been physiologically stimulated by Ag should aid comprehensive studies of the Ag-specific memory cell pool in vivo, in health and disease."
2099,0.005,1.0000,"This work aims to elucidate the effects of age and HIV-1 infection on the frequency and function of T cell subsets in response to HIV-specific and non-specific stimuli. As compared with the younger AIDS group, the frequencies of naive and central memory T cells were significantly lower in aged AIDS patients. Although there was also a dramatic loss of classical CD4(+)FoxP3(+)CD25(+)Treg cells in this patient group, high frequencies of IL-10-producing CD4(+)FoxP3(-) T cells were observed. In our system, the increased production of IL-10 in aged AIDS patients was mainly derived from Env-specific CD4(+)FoxP3(-)CD152(+) T cells. Interestingly, while the blockade of IL-10 activity by monoclonal antibody clearly enhanced the release of IL-6 and IL-1Œ≤ by Env-stimulated PBMC cultures from aged AIDS patients, this monoclonal antibody enhanced in vitro HIV-1-replication. In conclusion, HIV infection and aging undoubtedly contribute synergistically to a complex immune dysfunction in T cell compartment of HAART-treated older HIV-infected individuals."

However, some contrasting evidence exists in the literature with regard to commonly reported risk factors. In this study, we investigated whether the known risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections have a stronger effect for either infection. This retrospective study included samples from 696 cats seropositive for FIV and 593 cats seropositive for FeLV from the United States and Canada. Data were collected during two cross sectional studies, where cats were tested using IDEXX FIV/FeLV ELISA kits. To compare the effect of known risk factors for FIV infection compared to FeLV, using a case-case study design, random intercept logistic regression models were fit including cats' age, sex, neuter status, outdoor exposure, health status and type of testing facility as independent variables. A random intercept for testing facility was included to account for clustering expected in testing practices at the individual clinics and shelters."
9345,0.005,1.0000,"Co-infection of HBV with HIV results in an accelerated course of HBV-associated chronic liver disease. Several studies have shown that viral mutations are related to disease progression in mono-infection with HBV. However, it is unclear whether HBV mutation patterns might differ between co-infected and mono-infected patients. To compare the frequencies and mutation patterns in the HBV genome between co-infection and mono-infection. Twenty-four treatment-na√Øve co-infected and 31 treatment-na√Øve mono-infected Thai patients were included. HBV mutations were characterized by whole genome sequencing of virus serum samples. The clinical features and frequency of known clinically significant mutations were compared between the two groups. No significant difference between the groups was found with respect to sex, age and HBeAg. However, HBV DNA levels were significantly higher in co-infected patients. The distribution of HBV genotypes was comparable between the two groups and restricted mostly to sub-genotypes C1 and B2. An isolate with recombinants of genotypes G/C1 was also identified in a patient with co-infection. There was no difference in the prevalence of mutations in the enhancer II/basal core promoter/precore region, pre-S/S and polymerase genes between the two groups. In conclusion, dual infections tend to engender increased HBV DNA levels. There was no major difference in the frequencies of common HBV mutations between co-infected and mono-infected patients. Thus, HBV mutations may not contribute to disease pathogenesis in Thai patients with co-infection."
2656,0.005,1.0000,"Postmortem cesarean sections are rare events, but modern technology is forcing society to explore the definition of viability and the legal rights of both mother and fetus that ultimately will affect the frequency and use of this rare operation. Since the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevalence rate and the number of critically ill obstetrical patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) continues to rise, it is reasonable to assume more patients and physicians may be confronted by issues concerning fetal and maternal rights and other considerations in perimortem delivery. A 33-year-old woman, at 27 weeks' gestation, with fulminant AIDS was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in respiratory distress. As her condition deteriorated the complex problem of caring for both mother and fetus emerged. A patient advisory panel explored the issues with the patient, her family, and her health care team. Eventually a peri/postmortem cesarean section was performed on the mother when she suffered an acute fatal cardiorespiratory arrest. With the prevalence of AIDS increasing and with most women not being tested prior to pregnancy, many obstetricians will be confronted with new medical and legal challenges. Establishing comprehensive medical management for the critically ill obstetrical patient and understanding the legal rights of both patients (mother and fetus) will help avoid conflicts and potentially improve survival."

In the present study we investigated the subclass distribution of IgG-anti-Fab autoantibodies, and whether anti-Fab antibodies of the IgA and IgM isotypes also are associated with the development of AIDS. Sera of HIV+ patients with AIDS had significantly higher IgA-anti-Fab activity than HIV+ patients with ARC (p < 0.02), HIV+ patients without AIDS/ARC (p < 0.0001), HIV-negative (HIV-) patients (p < 0.001), or healthy controls (p < 0.0001). An inverse association was found between IgA-anti-Fab activity and CD4+ cell counts (r = -0.396, p < 10(-6)). In contrast, no association of CD4+ cell counts was observed with IgM-anti-Fab. However, IgM-anti-Fab was significantly increased in patients with thrombocytopenia. We found a significant association between IgA-anti-Fab activity and serum neopterin concentrations (r = 0.310, p < 10(-5)). IgG-anti-Fab activity was detected mainly in the IgG3 fraction, although in HIV+ patients with AIDS/ARC various IgG subclasses were present. Affinity-purified anti-Fab antibodies isolated from sera of AIDS patients bound to rgp120-preincubated CD4+ cells of a healthy individual, supporting our hypothesis that anti-Fab antibodies and free circulating gp120 molecules are involved in the elimination of uninfected CD4+ cells. Removal of anti-Fab autoantibodies from the circulation by immune adsorbance might be a useful approach in the treatment of AIDS."

The aim of the present study was to determine the clinical and laboratory profiles of HIV-infected individuals referred to a clinic for patients with special needs between 2005 and 2012 by retrospectively analyzing their dental records. A total of 97 records of HIV patients referred to the School of Dentistry of Ribeir√£o Preto, Universidade de S√£o Paulo - USP, were analyzed. The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine the associations between mean CD4+ counts, mean viral load, and the presence of HIV-related oral lesions (HIV-OL). Most of the patients were male, and their mean age was 38.3 years. Eighty-nine (92%) patients were on regular ART, 77 (79.4%) had a CD4+ count higher than 200 cells/mm3, and 63 (64.9%) had an undetectable viral load. Twenty patients (20.6%) presented with some HIV-OL, including pseudomembranous and/or erythematous candidiasis and angular cheilitis, which were correlated with a low CD4+ count and with an undetectable viral load (p < 0.05). Among the branches of dentistry, periodontics, followed by surgery and restorative dentistry, was the most sought-after specialty, and no intercurrent events were observed during the dental treatment. It may be concluded that there are no restrictions on the dental treatment of patients on regular ART, It is important, though, that the treatment be based on local characteristics and on the prevention of oral diseases.

3966,0.005,1.0000,"Assiduous measures are taken to prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to infants; it is unclear whether the mothers receive appropriate care for their chronic HBV. We sought to assess the quality of HBV care in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers following pregnancy. HBsAg-positive women (n = 243) who had sought prenatal care at Massachusetts General Hospital were retrospectively identified and charts reviewed. The primary outcome was adherence to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines. Over one-third (37%) of women were first diagnosed with HBV infection at a prenatal visit. One-third (32%) did not undergo timely liver function test measurements. HBV DNA was never measured in 26% and was untimely in 34% of patients. One-third (34%) of the women were at high-risk for HCC based on AASLD criteria, yet only 33% of these women underwent timely imaging. Nearly half (49%) never saw a liver specialist for their HBV care. In multivariate analysis, women were 3.7 times more likely to have a timely ALT and 8.1 times more likely to have a timely HBV DNA if they were followed by a liver specialist (P = 0.001, <0.001). We demonstrate remarkably inadequate and discontinuous HBV care for chronically infected mothers following pregnancy. As HBV infection is already being identified prenatally, quality improvement measures encompassing obstetricians, primary care providers and hepatologists are needed to ensure that HBV-infected women are linked to care postpregnancy."

The anemia promptly remitted after immunoglobulin therapy in 3 of 4 treated patients. The presence of IgM to B19, the clinical circumstance in which anemia developed, and the marrow morphology were poor predictors of chronic B19 infection. DNA hybridization studies of sera from 191 HIV-infected and 117 HIV-seronegative homosexual males attending a clinic in the Seattle area revealed that 1 (0.5%) and 2 (2%) samples, respectively, from the 2 groups contained B19. However, when assayed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 5% of the serum samples from HIV-infected persons and 9% from uninfected persons contained B19, although each had an HCT of > or =40. The data argue that anemia results from chronic high-titer B19 infection. Although a negative PCR assay excludes this diagnosis, DNA hybridization may be the more specific serum test."
5402,0.005,1.0000,"Routine military screening identified human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in an asymptomatic dentist who had three prior negative antibody tests. A look-back investigation evaluated the provider and the practice and provided notification, counseling, and HIV testing for patients. Test results were linked to dental procedures categorized by levels of invasiveness. Of 1631 patients tested, all were negative for antibody to HIV. Analysis of 12,164 procedures on 876 patients determined 20.5% of patients had procedures from the highest stratum of invasiveness; 42% had only low-risk exposure. Stratification of the degree of invasive exposure and clinical evaluation of disease stage in the infected health care worker are important in look-back investigations. The early stage of disease in the provider, the adherence to infection control precautions, and the low percentage of invasive procedures may have contributed to the lack of transmission. These results are consistent with current assessment that risk of transmission of HIV during invasive medical procedures is low."
969,0.005,1.0000,"To reduce unnecessary exposure to treatment, physicians must decide at an early stage whether continuation of treatment has a reasonable chance of success for the individual patient. The objectives of our study were to evaluate the previously described quantitative hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) measurements vs quantitative hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA measurements for prediction of nonresponse and response in interferon (IFN)-alpha treated HBeAg positive chronic HBV patients. Serum HBV DNA and HBeAg levels were assessed at baseline and weeks 8 and 12. For each test (HBV DNA level at baseline, HBV DNA decrease between baseline and weeks 8 and 12, or the combination of these two, as well as HBeAg level at baseline, HBeAg decrease between baseline and weeks 8 and 12, and the combination of these two), we calculated the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity. Monitoring with quantitative HBV DNA levels (area under ROC 0.87) was superior to monitoring with quantitative HBeAg levels (0.76, P < 0.05). Step-wise logistic regression identified HBV DNA at baseline and decrease in HBV DNA from baseline to week 12, as independent predictors of response. The overall test performance of predicting nonresponse (predictive value 100%) was best for log HBV DNA testing at week 12 compared with testing at week 8 due to a better prediction of sustained response (46%vs 38%) and lower misidentification of nonresponse (39%vs 54%). This study showed that quantitative HBV DNA testing at baseline in combination with a decrease between baseline and week 12 has a high predictive value for identifying patients who have virtually no chance of reaching a sustained response with IFN therapy."

Patients coinfected with HIV and HBV may have hepatitis flares when lamivudine therapy is discontinued or when resistance of HBV to lamivudine emerges. This retrospective, descriptive study conducted in three tertiary care medical centers describes patients coinfected with HIV type 1 and HBV who presented with a spectrum of clinical and subclinical hepatitic responses to lamivudine withdrawal or resistance. One patient had fulminant hepatic failure and a second patient had subclinical hepatitis when lamivudine therapy was discontinued and a more efficacious antiretroviral regimen was substituted. Three patients had flares of hepatitis after 13 to 18 months of lamivudine therapy. Lamivudine withdrawal or emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutants in patients coinfected with HIV and HBV may result in severe hepatitis. Clinicians caring for patients with coinfection with HIV and HBV should be aware of the possibility that a hepatitis B flare may occur in previously asymptomatic carrier patients."

This cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey and oral screening (OS) included 100 subjects who were HIV positive. The OS was conducted by a dentist blinded to the subject's survey responses. Xerostomia was determined by asking the subjects a single question. Subjects with xerostomia were found to have increased caries activity and poorer QoL, especially in the psychological dimensions of the oral health impact profile. Age and duration of HIV infection were associated with xerostomia. Early diagnosis of xerostomia and intervention with preventive dental care would potentially reduce caries and improve QoL among patients infected with HIV-1. Ongoing chronic inflammation of salivary glands despite the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapy may play a role in the etiology of xerostomia in patients infected with HIV and requires further study."

Test results were available from 8485 (86.1%) of the 9860 women delivering at four public hospitals. The test results were linked to demographic and medical information available from routinely collected delivery records. Three specimens were HIV-positive, for a seroprevalence of 3.5 per 10,000. The seropositive women were all Latina. The prevalence of HIV among women delivering at all hospitals in Los Angeles County has been shown to be relatively low compared with that of other metropolitan areas with a high number of AIDS cases, such as New York city, but appears to be even lower among women delivering at public hospitals during this time period. This low prevalence is attributed to the predominance of Latinas, who may have lower levels of infection, among public hospital parturients. The relatively low prevalence of HIV among injection drug users in Los Angeles County may contribute to the overall lower prevalence among women in Los Angeles County compared with those in New York city. This study supplements county-specific data obtained from statewide blinded neonatal testing by providing details on HIV seroprevalence among the catchment populations of public hospitals in Los Angeles County."
5168,0.005,1.0000,"The present study examined the comparative efficacy of intervening at the caregiver/care-recipient dyadic level, versus the individual caregiver level, for caregivers and their care-recipients with HIV/AIDS. Participants were randomly assigned to a Dyad Intervention (DI), a Caregiver Intervention (CI) or Wait List Control group (WLC), and assessed by interview and self-administered scales immediately before treatment and eight weeks later. Participants in the intervention groups also completed a four-month follow-up assessment. Dependent variables included global distress, social adjustment, dyadic adjustment, subjective health status, HIV/AIDS knowledge and target problem ratings. Results showed that caregivers in the DI group showed greater improvement from pre- to post-treatment on global distress, dyadic adjustment and target problems than the CI and WLC caregivers. The CI and DI caregivers showed greater improvement than the WLC group on all dependent variables except social adjustment. Care-recipients in the DI group improved significantly from pre- to post-treatment on dyadic adjustment, social adjustment, knowledge, subjective health status and Target Problem 1, whereas the CI and WLC care-recipients failed to improve on any of these measures. The treatment gains made by the DI caregivers and care-recipients on most dependent variables were maintained at a four-month follow-up. Findings support a reciprocal determinism approach to the process of dyadic adjustment and suggest that intervening at the caregiver/care-recipient level may produce better outcomes for both the caregiver and care-recipient than intervening at the individual caregiver level."

After three weeks, TCC showed HIV integration in their DNA, as shown by polymerase chain reaction analysis and Southern blot technique. All the three HIV-infected TCC maintained their ability to recognize the specific antigen, even if their proliferative ability was reduced. The ability of the HIV-infected TCC to produce IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-gamma in response to phorbol myristate acetate plus anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody was decreased, whereas their ability to produce TNF-alpha was unaffected or even enhanced. Two out of the three HIV-infected TCC showed the ability to provide helper function for polyclonal immunoglobulin production when cocultured with autologous B cells in the absence of any stimulant. These data suggest that in vitro infection of normal human TCC may provide a useful model for the study of immunological alterations induced by HIV."

Using cell culture and animal models, we showed that HNF4alpha supports HBV replication in nonhepatic cells and HNF3beta inhibits HBV replication. However, the expression of HNF4alpha and HNF3beta in the liver tissue of chronic HBV-infected patients and the relationship between the levels of HNF4alpha and HNF3beta and HBV replication are unclear. In this study, liver biopsy specimens from 86 chronic HBV-infected patients were collected. The expression levels of HNF4alpha, HNF3beta, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) were detected by an immunohistochemical technique and the level of HBV DNA was checked by in situ hybridization with serial sections from liver biopsy tissue samples. We show here that samples with higher levels of HNF4alpha expression also have higher levels of HBsAg, HBcAg and HBV DNA. In contrast, in samples with higher levels of HNF3beta expression, levels of HBsAg, HBcAg and HBV DNA were lower. There was a positive correlation between HNF4alpha expression and HBV replication, and a negative correlation between HNF3beta expression and HBV replication, in the liver of chronic HBV-infected patients. This suggests that HNF4alpha and HNF3beta likely participate in HBV replication in patients with HBV infection, or that HBV replication may somehow influence the expression of HNF4alpha and HNF3beta in the liver."

Among the seropositives, all of five evaluable had been exposed to blood and four of five to needle-stick injuries. Our data suggest that HCV, in addition to hepatitis B virus, may constitute an occupational hazard for health care workers in Stockholm, even though the risk appears to be low, and personal risk factors such as intravenous drug abuse or blood transfusion could not be ruled out as sources of the infection."

Longitudinal data were collected on 202 HIV-infected women without AIDS who were receiving care at Kings County Hospital or SUNY Health Sciences Center, Brooklyn, New York. Internal consistency results showed acceptable reliability for the four multi-item MOS scales (role function, physical function, general health perceptions and mental health). Symptomatic patients and patients with lower Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ratings reported lower HRQOL than those who were asymptomatic or who had higher KPS scores. Patients who were older, unemployed or who had a history of injection drug use (IDU) also reported lower HRQOL than those who were younger, employed or who had no drug use history. Adjusted mean scores on the MOS role and physical functioning scales proved sensitive to differences in clinical status over time. The MOS SF-20 is a reliable and valid instrument of HRQOL for women with HIV infection. Its sensitivity to differences in clinical status over time suggest that it may be useful as an HRQOL indicator for HIV/AIDS clinical trials."
4437,0.005,1.0000,"Evaluation of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-specific T-helper immunity could contribute in optimizing anti-HCMV therapy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Testin the lymphoproliferative response (LPR) is the standard technique used to evaluate T-helper response, but its use in the routine diagnostic laboratory setting can be problematic. The most promising new alternative technique is the determination of HCMV-specific CD4(+) T-cell frequency by flow cytometry detection of intracellular cytokine production after short-term antigen-specific activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. HCMV-specific LPR and CD4(+) T-cell frequency were compared in a group of 78 blood samples from 65 HIV-infected patients. The results showed concordance in 80.7% of samples. In addition, comparative analysis of sequential blood samples from 13 HIV-infected patients showed that while in about half of patients the T-helper HCMV-specific immune response remained stable during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), in the other half declining levels of the HCMV-specific CD4(+)-mediated immune response were determined by either one or both assays. In conclusion, our data suggest that the determination of HCMV-specific CD4(+) T-cell frequency can be considered a valuable alternative to the LPR test for the detection of HCMV-specific T-helper response in HIV-infected patients. It could facilitate wider screening of anti-HCMV T-helper activity in HIV-infected patients, with potential benefits for clinicians in deciding strategies of discontinuation or maintenance of anti-HCMV therapy."
4620,0.005,1.0000,"We studied human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection incidence over time in a 16-center cohort of hemophiliacs in the United States and Europe and estimated the most likely date of seroconversion for all seropositive subjects. Five U.S. centers enrolled subjects independent of HIV-1 status, whereas 11 centers preferentially included seropositive subjects. We obtained unbiased estimates of HIV-1 infection incidence rates from the five centers and estimated dates of seroconversion from the distribution seen among seropositives from all centers. In the five-center cohort, infection incidence began in 1978, peaked in October 1982 at 22 infections per 100 person-years at risk, and declined to 4 per 100 person-years by July 1984. Few infections occurred after 1987, and by that time, 50% of the cohort had become infected. Median seroconversion dates for subgroups of all seropositives ranged from July 1980 to December 1983, depending on the dose and type of factor concentrate. Median dates in Europe ranged from September 1981 to March 1983 and reflected the use of products manufactured from American plasma. Infection incidence apparently peaked about the same time that public health interventions were introduced to reduce transmission. These interventions, including heat treatment of factor concentrates and deferral of high-risk donors, have prevented HIV-1 infection from becoming endemic among younger birth cohorts of persons with hemophilia."
9040,0.005,1.0000,"Invasive pneumococcal infection (IPI) is the most common serious bacterial infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children. Data from a population-based pediatric HIV surveillance project were used to determine the incidence of IPI in HIV-infected children and to conduct a case-control study assessing potential risk factors for IPI in HIV-infected children. There were 50 episodes of IPI and a cumulative incidence of 6.1 cases/100 patient-years through age 7 years. Children with IPI were more likely to have a prior AIDS diagnosis (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-15.1) and higher levels of IgG and IgM (P=.01) than were controls. In a separate case-control study, the manifestations of IPI in HIV-infected children were compared with those in HIV-negative controls. Focal complication rates in the 2 groups did not differ; however, HIV-infected children were less likely than controls to have leukocytosis (P<.001) and more likely to have isolates with penicillin resistance (P=.03)."
4346,0.005,1.0000,"In a program screening civilian applicants for U.S. military service for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, we studied the frequency of false positive diagnoses retrospectively among applicants seropositive for HIV in a subpopulation with a very low prevalence of infection. That subpopulation was defined as consisting of all applicants tested between October 16, 1985, and June 30, 1987, who were young (17 or 18 years of age) and resided in a rural county in a state with a low incidence of reported acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (n = 135,187). Serum specimens from 15 applicants positive for HIV in this low-prevalence subpopulation were retrieved from a serum bank and retested by two Western blot methods, radioimmunoprecipitation, and an immunoassay constructed from a molecularly cloned and expressed viral envelope polypeptide. Fourteen of the 15 samples were unequivocally positive on all retest assays, and 1 was negative. Thus, the measured rate of false positive diagnoses in this program was 1 in 135,187 persons tested. Factors important in achieving a low false positive rate were redundant, multistep testing algorithm, conservative criteria for interpreting Western blots, the requirement that a second, newly drawn serum specimen be tested for verification before a diagnosis of HIV was considered established, and tight quality control of laboratory testing procedures. We conclude that a screening program for HIV infection in a low-prevalence population can have an acceptably low false positive rate."
5876,0.005,1.0000,"Many physicians, dentists, and allied health personnel sustain occupational exposures to blood and other body fluids that increase their risk of contracting type B viral hepatitis. Overall, the risk of hepatitis B among persons employed in health-related fields is estimated to be approximately four times that in the general adult population. Studies on the incidence of infection and the prevalence of hepatitis B serologic markers have further defined risk in specific occupational categories and work activities. Physicians and dentists are five to ten times more likely than the general adult population to experience hepatitis B infection. Infection rates ten or more times above the average have often been characteristic of surgeons, patient care personnel in dialysis units and institutions for the mentally handicapped, and clinical laboratory workers having frequent contact with blood samples."

We compared clinicopathologic variables of patients who were treated in the pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and HAART eras and investigated whether exposure to antiretroviral agents with differing cerebrospinal fluid penetrations was associated with risk for PCL. All statistical tests were two-sided. Incidence of PCL was lower in the HAART era (1.2 cases per 1000 patient-years, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.8 to 1.9) than in the pre-HAART era (three cases per 1000 years, 95% CI = 2.1 to 4.0; P<.001), and overall survival was longer (median survival = 32 days, range = 5-315 days, versus 48 days, range = 15-1136 days; log rank P = .03). In the HAART era, fewer patients had prior acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining illnesses than in the pre-HAART era (64% versus 90%; P = .013), and patients were more likely to have the diagnosis of PCL confirmed histologically or by polymerase chain reaction (77% versus 26%; P<.001). Exposure to specific antiretroviral agents was not associated with risk for PCL."

8979,0.005,1.0000,"In comparison with other Canadian provinces and most Western countries, the province of Manitoba maintains a different vaccination policy for hepatitis B. This policy provides selective antenatal screening for hepatitis B in women and an inoculation program for hepatitis B vaccination for fourth-grade pupils. There has been increasing concern for this policy with regard to its influence on secular trends of acute hepatitis B incidence in Manitoba. This created a need to summarise the epidemiological characteristics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Manitoba and to allocate finances and human resources for future prevention programs. The Cadham Provincial Laboratory in Winnipeg, a Canadian Public Health Laboratory, is responsible for testing all specimens for diagnosis of various common infectious diseases in Manitoba. During the period from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 2003, a total of 285,946 clinical specimens were submitted to this laboratory, which confirmed 310 cases of acute HBV and 7,556 cases of chronic HBV infection. A total of 18,168 individuals were identified as having vaccine-induced immune status. The incidence rate of acute HBV infection has significantly decreased from 6.52/100,000 person-years in 1996 to 0.86/100,000 person-years in 2003. Annual prevalence rates of chronic HBV infection in Manitoba increased slightly from 42.96 cases/100,000 population in 1992 to 71.47 cases/100,000 population in 2003. Incidence rates were generally higher in men than in women at all age groups, with values of 2.65 and 1.65 per 100,000 population, respectively (chi-square=15.768, p value <0.001). The highest incidence rate for both males and females was observed in the age group 30-34 years. The North Eastman and Winnipeg Regional Health Authorities showed significantly higher incidence rates of acute hepatitis B compared with the other nine Regional Health Authorities. Selective hepatitis B vaccination programs for children in Manitoba had achieved the greatest success in the prevention of vertical and horizontal transmission. There is an urgent need to develop cost-effective harm-reduction strategies for hepatitis B prevention among adults (aged 30-34) and groups at risk in Manitoba."
343,0.005,1.0000,"Advances in antiretroviral therapy and treatment or prophylaxis against opportunistic infection have resulted in prolongation of the survival of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Previous research has demonstrated an association between AIDS and risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In addition to the approximately 3% of individuals found to have NHL at the time of AIDS onset, others continue to develop NHL following AIDS diagnosis. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute demonstrated a sharply increasing incidence of NHL among men in the age range 20-49 years since 1983 in the United States. Based on new data on the risk of NHL following AIDS diagnosis, on estimates of improved survival following AIDS diagnosis, and on projections of future AIDS incidence, we considered four sets of assumptions and estimated the number of AIDS-related NHL cases in 1992 to be between 2900 and 9800. Three of these projections were higher than the estimate of 4700 cases obtained by linear extrapolation of SEER incidence trends. These projections of AIDS-related NHL incidence suggest that between 8% and 27% of all NHL cases that occur in the United States in 1992 will arise as a consequence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), imposing a substantial health care burden. More research into the pathogenesis of lymphoma and new approaches to antiretroviral and antilymphoma therapy will be necessary to prevent and treat this formidable complication of infection with HIV."
705,0.005,1.0000,"This study investigated the number and range of surgical procedures performed in patients subsequently found to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. Procedures were included if they occurred during a period when the patients were likely to have been infected with HIV but unaware of their HIV status. A total of 28 operative procedures were documented in 19 (22 per cent) of 86 patients. Several operations were major and invasive. All patients had recognized risk factors for HIV infection but these had not been elicited in the surgical records. Women and patients who acquired their disease through heterosexual intercourse were more likely to have undergone surgery before a diagnosis of HIV than homosexual men. The incidence of surgical procedures in patients with HIV infection was significantly greater than in the general population of Leicestershire; however, many of these were minor and related to the management of complications associated with HIV. Surgeons are performing operations on patients who are unknowingly infected with HIV. The risk of transmission of HIV to surgeons is remote, but surgeons must be aware of risk factors for HIV infection."
4179,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) strains vary widely in their ability to grow in Old World monkey (OWM) cells. We previously evaluated several HIV-2 isolates for their sensitivity to cynomolgus monkey (CM) TRIM5alpha, an anti-HIV factor in OWM cells, and found that viruses carrying proline at the 120th position of the capsid protein were sensitive to CM TRIM5alpha, whereas those with either alanine or glutamine were resistant. In the study presented here, we tested these HIV-2 isolates for their sensitivity to rhesus monkey (Rh) TRIM5alpha and found that both CM TRIM5alpha-sensitive and -resistant viruses were restricted by Rh TRIM5alpha. The variable region 1 of the SPRY domain of Rh TRIM5alpha appeared to be the determinant of this difference. Furthermore, a mutagenesis study showed that three amino acid residues TFP at the 339th to 341st positions of Rh TRIM5alpha are important for restricting HIV-2 strains resistant to CM TRIM5alpha."

8433,0.005,1.0000,"In order to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in Royal Australian Navy personnel and to formulate policies for their education, screening and vaccination, a voluntary survey was undertaken. Seven hundred and forty-eight subjects completed a questionnaire that provided details of age, sex, rank, ethnic origin, service abroad, length of service, history of tattooing, liver disease and blood transfusions. Serum was assayed by radioimmunoassay for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (antiHBs) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (antiHBc). The presence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection was correlated with ""risk factors"" by means of the chi 2 test of independence. Fourteen (74%) of 19 personnel from the Pacific Islands, Asia and Africa who were excluded from analysis showed one-or-more such markers. The prevalence of any marker of hepatitis B virus infection was 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9%-5.9%). The individual markers HBsAg, antiHBs and antiHBc were found in 0.4% (95% CI, 0.1%-1.2%), 3.6% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.9%) and 3.9% (95% CI, 2.5%-5.3%) of subjects, respectively. The annual attack rate was estimated to be less than 1%. Factors which had a significant correlation with an increased prevalence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection included tattooing (especially if this had been performed in Asia), age, the duration of service and service abroad. Based on these data, and given the reduced cost of hepatitis B vaccines, vaccination now is considered worth while. A policy of vaccinating all personnel who may be required for service at sea, and others at risk, now is in effect. Educational programmes that are aimed at minimizing the risk of exposure to hepatitis B and other viral infections have been instituted."
4703,0.005,1.0000,"Injection drug use is a common route of infection for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the UK. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and force of infection for HBV among injecting drug users (IDUs) recruited from multiple community and drug agency settings in England and Wales between 1990 and 2004. Cross-sectional studies of IDUs in and out of contact with drug agencies were conducted throughout the 15-year period. Oral fluid samples were tested for antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between risk factors and anti-HBc positivity and force of infection models were explored. In total, 2527 injectors were recruited from community settings, and 29 386 from drug agencies. Anti-HBc prevalence was 31% (95% CI 30.7-31.8%). It declined in the early 1990s from around 50% in 1992 to 25% in 1999, after which it increased slightly. It was also higher in those who had injected for longer, older IDUs, those recruited in London and North West England, and those reporting having a previous voluntary confidential HIV test. The force of infection models suggested that the incidence of infection increased in 1999-2004 compared with 1993-1998, and was higher in new injectors compared with those injecting for > or =1 year. In conclusion, findings suggest ongoing HBV transmission in recent years despite an overall decline in prevalence in the early and mid-1990s, and highlight the importance of targeting vaccination programmes at new IDUs who have high incidence rates of infection."
6160,0.005,1.0000,"The role of beta-chemokines in controlling HIV replication in vivo is still controversial. Therefore, the association between HIV-1 plasma viral load and the capacity of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells to produce beta-chemokines was studied in 28 antiretroviral drug-na√Øve HIV-1-infected female sex workers in Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire. Percentages of beta-chemokine-positive T cells were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by flow cytometry after intracellular staining for RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, and MIP-1beta. HIV-1-infected subjects had higher percentages of MIP-1alpha- and MIP-1beta-positive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (p < 0.02) and of RANTES-positive CD8(+) T cells (p = 0.054) than uninfected controls. Percentages of RANTES- and MIP-1beta-positive CD8(+) T cells correlated directly with HIV-1 plasma viral load (p < 0.02). Percentages of beta-chemokine-positive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells correlated directly with percentages of HLA-DR-positive T cells (p < 0.02) and inversely (except RANTES in CD4(+) T cells) with absolute numbers of CD4(+) T cells (p < 0.05) in peripheral blood. These data indicate that increased percentages of beta-chemokine-producing T cells in HIV-1-infected subjects correlate with disease progression and are a sign of viremia-driven chronic T cell activation."

Of 385 subjects selected from 16 strata by sex, race (black or nonblack), and HIV/HTLV-II group (HIV positive [HIV(+)]/HTLV-II(+), HIV(+)/HTLV-II negative [HTLV-II(-)], HIV(-)/HTLV-II(+), and HIV(-)/HTLV-II(-)), 376 had HCV antibodies, of whom 305 had detectable HCV load. HCV RNA detection was unrelated to sex, race, and virus groups, but differed by study site. The mean HCV load was 5.4 log(10) IU/mL and was 0.24 log(10) higher in men than in women. Virus load increment with HIV or HTLV-II infection was higher among white subjects than among other subjects.

A total of 523 clinically diagnosed index chronic HBV infected cases and 172 asymptomatic patients (based on family screening) were enrolled with informed consent. Patients were stratified based on serology, imaging, pathology, and clinical data and grouped as chronic HBV and cirrhotic cohorts. Analysis for serum HBV DNA levels and HBV genotyping was performed, and was statistically co-related with disease severity. Males were more prone to chronic HBV infection. Majority of the patients who had Chronic HBV infection based on family screening were females (59.88%), majorly wives of index patients. Mean viral load in Chronic HBV patients was almost 4.5-folds higher than cirrhosis patients, and was significantly associated with e-antigen positive status(P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) in both groups. HBV genotype D was the most prevalent genotype (62.30%) in NEI. Mixed genotype infection of A‚Äâ+‚ÄâD was found from Assam, along with C‚Äâ+‚ÄâD cases (1.29%) cumulatively. There is a high prevalence of HBV genotype C (13.96%) in our studied cohort which was found to be associated with higher viral load(P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.018), e-antigen positivity(P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.043), and increased cirrhosis risk compared to Chronic HBV cases [OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.670]. Family contacts in NEI are prone to infection with HBV and development of Chronic HBV. Higher presence of e-positive cases and genotype C along with the mixed genotypes in NEI is unique and of significance with reference to predisposition to disease severity and even response to antiviral therapy."

In a series of 132 (65 anti-HIV positive) homosexual non-drug addicted men with chronic hepatitis B, the liver function was assessed with biochemical tests; the degree of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication was assessed with serum HBV DNA level and with immunoperoxidase staining of hepatitis B core (HBc) antigen on liver specimens; and the severity of liver lesions was assessed with an histology activity index. Anti-HIV-positive and anti-HIV-negative patients were not different for serum aspartate transaminase activity, bilirubin, prothrombin, and histology activity index. Anti-HIV-positive patients had lower serum alanine transaminase activity levels (P =.0001), lower serum albumin levels (P =.0009), and higher serum HBV DNA levels (P =.01). There was a higher prevalence of cirrhosis in anti-HIV-positive patients (P =.04).

This pilot prospective case-control study was designed to evaluate the combination of ZDV plus didanosine [ddI] compared with ZDV monotherapy as an initial therapeutic strategy. 'Control' patients (ZDV monotherapy) were matched with 'case' patients (ZDV plus ddI combination therapy) according to the presence or absence of AIDS-defining criteria at entry and CD4 cell count. The case patient group consisted of 35 consecutive HIV-1-infected individuals with < or = 300 CD4 cells/mm3, no previous experience of antiretroviral therapy and who accepted treatment with a combination of ZDV plus ddI. The control patient group consisted of 35 consecutive patients with similar characteristics, but who preferred to start treatment with ZDV alone. Control patients received 250 mg ZDV bid and case patients received ZDV at the same dose plus ddI (200 mg bid). Primary study endpoints were virological (serum HIV-1 RNA) and immunological (CD4 cell count) responses. Viral phenotype (syncytium-inducing (SI) or non-syncytium-inducing (NSI)), development of mutations at codons 215, 41 and 74 and clinical progression (new AIDS-defining event or death) were also assessed. Virological and CD4 cell count responses were significantly greater and more sustained in the group treated with ZDV plus ddI than in the control group, with peak responses of -1.2 +/- 0.7 log10 versus -0.3 +/- 0.4 log10 at 1 month (P = 0.0003) and 61 +/- 52 cells/mm3 versus 19 +/- 25 cells/mm3 at 2 months (P = 0.001), respectively.

4331,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) coinfect many individuals in North America and in parts of Africa. Infection with HIV is a leading risk factor for the development of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HIV infection of common or adjacent cells would stimulate replication and spread of KSHV. Infection of a primary effusion lymphoma cell line by vesicular stomatitis virus type G-pseudotyped HIV type 1 led to a rapid induction of lytic-phase KSHV replication. Induction of lytic KSHV replication by HIV required active replication of HIV. The addition of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine or the protease inhibitor indinavir to the culture prevented HIV spread and inhibited the associated induction of KSHV lytic replication. Lytic replication occurred in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected cells within the culture, and could be induced in uninfected cells via a soluble factor released from the HIV-infected cells. Transmission of infectious KSHV to an uninfected target cell was enhanced by HIV replication and was inhibited by antiretroviral drugs. These results may have implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of KS in individuals coinfected with KSHV and HIV."
4699,0.005,1.0000,"During the earlier years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, initial reports described sensorineural hearing loss in up to 49% of individuals with HIV/AIDS. During those years, patients commonly progressed to advanced stages of HIV disease and frequently had neurological complications. However, the abnormalities on pure-tone audiometry and brainstem-evoked responses outlined in small studies were not always consistently correlated with advanced stages of HIV/AIDS. Moreover, these studies could not exclude the confounding effect of concurrent opportunistic infections and syphilis. Additional reports also have indicated that some antiretroviral medications may be ototoxic; thus, it has been difficult to make conclusions regarding the cause of changes in hearing function in HIV-infected patients. More recently, accelerated aging has been suggested as a potential explanation for the disproportionate increase in complications of aging described in many HIV-infected patients; hence, accelerated aging-associated hearing loss may also be playing a role in these patients."

9347,0.005,1.0000,"Type and prevalence of zidovudine (ZDV) resistance mutations in HIV-1-infected children in clinically stable condition and on ZDV monotherapy were analyzed to evaluate the effect of switching to didanosine (ddI) monotherapy or to ZDV plus ddI on the pattern of mutations and on the clinical outcome. Monthly clinical and laboratory controls for HIV-1 infection status were performed; at enrollment and every 4 to 6 months after treatment randomization mutant proviral sequences were evaluated in all the children, whereas viral burden was performed only in a small subgroup of patients randomly selected in each of the three treatment groups. ZDV resistance-associated proviral DNA mutations were defined as low-level resistance (LLR) mutations or medium/high-level resistance (MHLR) mutations; clinical outcome was considered as stable or deteriorating. Results showed that at entry into the study the duration of ZDV therapy was significantly correlated with the presence of mutations, and that the level of resistance given by mutations was associated with the severity both of symptoms and immunodeficiency. After randomization to treatment, in patients with mutations that confer LLR a better clinical outcome with ddI monotherapy than with ZDV plus ddI and ZDV alone was observed in the subsequent 6 months, whereas in patients with mutations that confer MHLR no significant difference among the three treatment groups was found. Data showed also that levels of viral burden at the time of changing therapy are related to clinical outcome if measured by plasma viral load. These results suggest that genotypic resistance assays, together with viral load, may prove useful for rational treatment decisions both at the start of therapy and with failure."

The specificity in the diagnosis of HIV-infection is markedly increased with newer serological methods using recombinant peptides but did not improve sensitivity on African sera. Neopterin was determined as a sensitive indirect marker for the activation of T-cells and is therefore correlated with the susceptibility of HIV infection and with progression of disease. High seroprevalence rates for various infectious agents were determined and may explain the high rate of elevated neopterin levels in 80% of the Africans. Neopterin levels were even higher in HIV patients. Viral p24 antigen was found only in two persons, one of whom had no antibodies detectable."
33,0.005,1.0000,"We report on the frequency of genetic mutations associated with drug resistance in antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from Martinique (French West Indies), where zidovudine (ZDV) has been available since 1987 and where combination therapy developed simultaneously with its use in continental France. Genotypic resistance was studied in plasma HIV RNA from samples collected between 1988 and 1998 from 70 antiretroviral-naive study subjects, half presenting with either primary infection or documented seroconversion. A line probe assay (LIPA) was used to detect substitutions on the reverse transcriptase (RT) codons 41, 69, 70, 74, 184, and 215. Direct sequencing was used to complete the data for RT codons which were uninterpretable by LIPA. Of these patients, 17 harbored mutated viruses with one or more mutations in the RT gene codons analyzed. ZDV resistance mutations T215Y/F, M41L, and K70R were found in 2, 5, and 12 individuals, respectively. Mutant strains L74V (didanosine [ddI] and dideoxycytidine [ddC]) were detected in 3 patients and M184V (lamivudine/ddI/ddC) in 4 patients. However, pure mutant results at one or more codons of interest were observed in only 5 (7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-13%) patients, all involving ZDV resistance. One carried both mutations T215Y and M41L known to confer a high degree of phenotypic resistance to ZDV. Among a subgroup of 28 patients with a timepoint of infection after 1995, 24 [86%; approximately 95% CI, 73%-99%) presented with a wild-type pattern. The significance of the high prevalence of mixed patterns observed in drug-naive patients remains unclear. However, the frequency of primary mutant genotypes associated with high levels of drug resistance is low in Martinique and in this study we did not observe any currently increased tendency in this frequency."
3424,0.005,1.0000,"Chloroquine and its analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been shown to inhibit a variety of viral infections including influenza and adenovirus through blockade of viral entry via inhibition of endosomal acidification. We have extended these observations to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection utilizing primary T cells and monocytes, a T cell line (CEM), and a monocytic cell line (U-937). HCQ inhibited HIV-1 replication (> 75%), as measured by reverse transcriptase activity, in the primary T cells and monocytes as well as the T cell and monocytic cell lines. HCQ itself had no anti-reverse transcriptase activity and was not toxic to the cells at concentrations inhibitory to viral replication. Intracytoplasmic staining with an anti-p24 antibody, 24 h after infection, revealed the presence of intracytoplasmic virus, suggesting that the drug does not block viral entry. The production of steady-state HIV-1 mRNA was not affected by HCQ in that comparable levels of HIV-1 mRNA could be detected by Northern blot analysis and by in situ hybridization in both the HCQ-treated and untreated cells. However, HCQ does appear to affect production of infectious HIV-1 virions because viral isolates from HCQ-treated cells could not infect target CEM cells. These data suggest that HCQ may be useful adjunctive therapy in the treatment of HIV-1 infection."
4205,0.005,1.0000,Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the primary etiological agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This virus can be transmitted by blood or blood products. Homosexual males (HM) are regarded as one of the high-risk groups for AIDS. Lymphocytes obtained from HM were used for cocultivation with fresh HIV antibody negative lymphocytes. The presence of virus particles was monitored by reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. Three out of eleven donors were found to have reverse transcriptase activity. All three donors were also found to be HIV antibody positive. HIV DNA from infected cells was detected by dot blot hybridization. The number of genome per cell is low. The correlation between RT activity and the cytolytic effect of HIV will be discussed.
1493,0.005,1.0000,"In this update, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all patients infected by type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). The strength and grade of the recommendation vary depending on the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, the presence of opportunistic infections or comorbid conditions, age, and the efforts to prevent the transmission of HIV. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable plasma viral load (PVL). Initial ART should comprise three drugs, namely, two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and one drug from another family. Three of the recommended regimens, all of which have an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) as the third drug, are considered a preferred regimen; a further seven regimens, which are based on an INSTI, an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or a protease inhibitor boosted with ritonavir (PI/r), are considered alternatives. The reasons and criteria for switching ART are presented both for patients with an undetectable PVL and for patients who experience virological failure, in which case the rescue regimen should include three (or at least two) drugs that are fully active against HIV. The specific criteria for ART in special situations (acute infection, HIV-2 infection, pregnancy) and comorbid conditions (tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer) are updated.

8140,0.005,1.0000,"Three flavans, daphnodorins A, B and C isolated from Dahpne odora THUNB. were tested for their abilities to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1(IIIB)) replication in MT-4 cells. The effective concentrations (EC50) of daphnodorins A, B and C against HIV-1-induced cytolysis were 0.26 +/- 0.08, 1.8 +/- 0.6 and 3.6 +/- 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Also these three compounds showed inhibitory effects of p24 antigen in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. As compared with 2',3'-dideoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (DDC-TP), daphnodorin A and daphnodorin C had relatively weak inhibitory effects on the reverse transcriptase of HIV-1, while daphnodorin B did not show any inhibitory effect at concentrations up to 1000 micrograms/ml. These three compounds showed marked inhibitory effects on syncytium formation between HIV-1(IIIB)-infected and uninfected MOLT-4 (clone 8) cells at 3-30 micrograms/ml without inducing cytotoxicity. The concentrations of the compounds blocking syncytium formation were consistent with the effective concentrations (EC50) against HIV-induced cytolysis of MT-4 cells. These results, differing from reverse transcriptase inhibitors, suggest that the daphnodorins exert their anti-HIV-1 activity through inhibition of early events of viral replication including adsorption of the virions to the cells or the subsequent entry."
7745,0.005,1.0000,"Foscarnet is a broad-spectrum viral DNA polymerase inhibitor active in vitro and in vivo against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Strains of HIV-1 resistant to foscarnet were selected by in vitro passage in increasing concentrations of drug. Reduced susceptibility to foscarnet was evident at the levels of both HIV-1 replication and reverse transcriptase. Biologically cloned, foscarnet-resistant strains with distinct genotypes were hypersensitive to zidovudine, azidodeoxyuridine, nevirapine, and R82913 but had unchanged susceptibility to zalcitibine and didanosine. The reverse transcriptase of foscarnet-resistant strains had unique substitutions Glu89-Lys, Leu92-Ile, or Ser156-Ala, the third being associated with six polymorphic changes. Introduction of these mutations into wild-type HIV-1 by site-directed mutagenesis confirmed their role in foscarnet resistance. In the three-dimensional structure of the reverse transcriptase enzyme these amino acids are located close to the template strand of the template primer and far away from the putative pyrophosphate binding site, suggesting that the mechanism by which HIV-1 becomes resistant to foscarnet is indirect. Foscarnet resistance is thus likely to be mediated through an altered interaction of the mutant enzyme with the template strand of the template primer which distorts the geometry of the polymerase active site and thereby decreases foscarnet binding."
5998,0.005,1.0000,"To define factors predictive of failure to respond to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-infected subjects pretreated with zidovudine (ZDV), three groups of subjects shifted to double therapy with ZDV plus didanosine (ddI, n = 13), zalcitabine (ddC, n = 14), or lamivudine (3TC, n = 12) were retrospectively evaluated, with respect to addition of the second NRTI, at week 0 and week 24. Factors considered included duration of ZDV pretreatment, CD4+ cell counts, plasma HIV-1 RNA load, peripheral blood mononuclear cell HIV-1 DNA load, and HIV-1 DNA genotypic resistance to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. The three groups were well matched for baseline characteristics and did not differ significantly in virological and immunological response to the different combination treatments. Drug-specific resistance mutations were selected in more than half the cases by 3TC, but not by ddI and ddC. Low-level and substantial genotypic resistance to ZDV was detected 13 (33.3%) and in 19 (48.7%) patients at baseline, respectively, and evolved through week 24 in several patients. When subjects were divided into responders and nonresponders to the second nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor on the basis of a decrease of more than 0.5 log10 (n = 15) or less than 0.5 log10 (n = 21) in HIV-1 RNA, respectively, baseline genotypic ZDV resistance was the only independent predictor of failure in a logistic regression model (P = 0.003 or P = 0.024, depending on whether low-level resistance was considered or not, respectively). Thus, selection of ZDV resistance mutations may impair subsequent use of different nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor compounds."
9883,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in humans is strongly linked to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Activation of growth-regulatory genes may play a crucial role in carcinogenesis. Proto-oncogene expression has been shown to be higher in HCC tissue with integrated HBV DNA than in the normal liver. Earlier, we showed that the 3' end of the HBV major surface gene (S) (426-855 nucleotides of the S region) is a transactivator of the X promoter-enhancer regulatory element in co-transfection experiments. This region expresses a truncated carboxy terminal S protein extending from amino acid residues 102 to 226. In this study, the truncated S protein (trc-S) was examined for its enhancing activity on several viral and cellular regulatory elements. The results indicate that trc-S activates rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (LTR), human T-lymphotropic virus 2 LTR, human immunodeficiency virus 1 LTR, and the c-jun and c-fos promoters. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays carried out to investigate its DNA-binding properties established that trc-S binds to HBV X promoter and oligonucleotides representing binding sites for the AP1 and TFIID transcription factors. The specificity of this interaction was confirmed by using competition experiments and supershift assays. These experiments suggest that trc-S is a transactivator of several cellular and viral promoters and that this activity is mediated by direct interaction with DNA."
664,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation from resolved infection is a serious problem which can frequently lead to severe hepatitis. Generally, it occurs several months after the start of immunosuppressive therapy; however, it sometimes occurs a few years later, even after cessation of therapy. Here we report a patient with de novo HBV infection who had received corticosteroid therapy for pemphigus vulgaris for 6¬†years. Full-genome HBV sequence analysis using serial serum samples revealed that the patient was infected with HBV subgenotype C2, which had the G1896R mixed mutation in the precore region. Interestingly, it had the immune escape mutations P120A and G145R in the S gene. Because both hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAb) were positive at the onset of the de novo infection, it was considered that HBV with these mutations escaped from neutralization by the pre-existing HBsAbs. This case indicates that HBV reactivation with an immune escape mutant can occur long after immunosuppressive therapy. "
3687,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment of 171 patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) 10 mg over 48 weeks resulted in significant histological, virological, serological, and biochemical improvement compared with placebo. The long-term efficacy and safety of ADV in a subset of these patients was investigated for up to 5 years. Sixty-five patients given ADV 10 mg in year 1 elected to continue in a long-term safety and efficacy study (LTSES). At enrollment, the 65 LTSES patients were a median 34 years old, 83% male, 74% Asian, 23% Caucasian, median baseline serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA 8.45 log(10) copies/mL, and median baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 2.0 x upper limit of normal. At 5 years on study, the median changes from baseline in serum HBV DNA and ALT for the 41 patients still on ADV were 4.05 log(10) copies/mL and -50 U/L, respectively. HBeAg loss and seroconversion were observed in 58% and 48% of patients by end of study, respectively. Fifteen patients had baseline and end of follow-up liver biopsies; improvements in necroinflammation and fibrosis were seen in 67% and 60% of these patients, respectively. Adefovir resistance mutations A181V or N236T developed in 13 LTSES patients; the first observation was at study week 195. There were no serious adverse events related to ADV."
8096,0.005,1.0000,"Foscarnet was administered by continuous intravenous infusion in 15 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in an open, uncontrolled study. Mean steady state serum concentrations of foscarnet was 261 mumol/l. Treatment was given for 6-21 days, median 14 days, being interrupted prematurely due to renal function impairment in seven patients, and due to other reasons in three patients. Foscarnet therapy was accompanied by improvement of some, probably cytomegalovirus (CMV) related, symptoms but did not otherwise affect the clinical condition of the patients. The occurrence of positive CMV cultures decreased significantly during therapy. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) detection by culture was positive in 70-80% of cultures and was unaffected by foscarnet treatment. Eight patients had detectable, free HIV antigen in serum before therapy, and in five of these HIV antigen disappeared during therapy, but reappeared 4-23 weeks after therapy. No patient lost HIV antigen, except during foscarnet therapy. No patient became HIV antigen positive during foscarnet therapy. Immunological parameters did not change during or after foscarnet therapy. Renal function impairment was seen in 9 patients (95% confidence limits, 32-84%), apparently due to reversible tubular damage. At follow-up, serum creatine was normal in all surviving patients. Concomitant medication may have contributed to the renal side-effects. Severe renal function impairment, i.e. serum creatinine above 0.25 mumol/l, was only seen in patients who at the start of foscarnet therapy were chronically affected by their disease. Thus, foscarnet reduces HIV antigen production in AIDS patients. Renal function impairment limits foscarnet use in AIDS patients, but in individuals with less severe manifestations of HIV infection, this side effect may be less frequent."
9902,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) p24 antigen, a putative marker of virus load, was assayed in 79 blood and 83 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 90 HIV-1-seropositive individuals with or without dementia. Twenty-eight subjects had no evidence of neuropsychological impairment, 17 had mild impairment without objective evidence of dementia, and 45 were demented. HIV-1 p24 antigen was detected more frequently in CSF samples from demented (19/40) than normal (1/26) or mildly impaired (1/17) subjects and in 67% of individuals with significant dementia (MSK stages 2-4). p24 Antigen was detected less frequently in CSF from demented subjects on antiretroviral drugs than untreated demented individuals. Overall, the sensitivity of the antigen capture assay in CSF among demented individuals was 47.5%; the specificity, 95.0%; positive predictive value, 90.4%; negative predictive value, 66.1%; and the efficiency, 72.2%. A direct relationship was also noted between the degree of cognitive impairment and blood p24 antigen detection frequency and antigen concentration. CD4+ blood lymphocyte counts were lower for demented individuals, and HIV-1 p24 antigen was detected more frequently and p24 antigen concentration was higher in blood and CSF from individuals with low CD4+ blood lymphocyte counts. beta 2-Microglobulin levels were higher in CSF from demented subjects and correlated directly with CSF p24 antigen concentration. However, in contrast to CD4+ blood lymphocyte counts and beta 2-microglobulin levels, only p24 antigen concentration correlated with dementia severity. Therefore, p24 antigen can be a useful marker for dementia related to HIV-1 infection."
6215,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA has been localized in antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) from patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). DCs from patients with CHC also exhibit impaired functional capacities. However, HCV RNA in DCs and functional impairment of DCs in CHC might be independent or interrelated events. Moreover, the impact of antiviral therapy on the functions of DCs in CHC is not well documented. In order to address these issues, we took advantage of antiviral therapy in these patients. Ten patients with CHC, expressing HCV RNA in circulating DCs, became negative for HCV RNA in circulating DCs after therapy with interferon-alpha and ribavirin for 4 weeks. The functions of DCs from HCV RNA+ patients (isolated before antiviral therapy) and HCV RNA- patients (isolated 4 weeks after antiviral therapy) were compared in allogenic mixed leucocyte reactions. In comparison to circulating DCs from normal control subjects, DCs from HCV RNA+ patients had a significantly decreased capacity to stimulate allogenic T lymphocytes (P < 0.01) and produce interleukin-12 (P < 0.05). However, the allostimulatory capacity of circulating DCs from HCV RNA- patients was several-fold higher compared to that of HCV RNA+ DCs from the same patient. DC from HCV RNA- patients also produced significantly higher levels of interleukin-12 compared to HCV RNA+ DCs from the same patient (P < 0.01). Taken together, this study is the first to provide experimental evidence regarding the impact of HCV RNA and antiviral therapy on the function of DCs in patients with CHC."
8562,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment with interferon-alpha leads to cessation of viral replication in 30-40% of patients with chronic hepatitis B. Preliminary data suggest that therapeutic vaccination in patients with chronic HBV infection may be beneficial. The present trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of combination therapy of interferon-alpha with HBsAg vaccination in patients who previously failed to respond to interferon-alpha alone. Eighteen patients positive for HBsAg and HBeAg were included. Mean ALT was 81+/-23 units/liter and 7 (39%) patients had HBV-DNA levels >2000 pg/ml. Patients received 5 million IU interferon-alpha 2b (Intron A) thrice weekly for six months and recombinant HBsAg (Gen H-B-Vax) at the beginning and 4 and 12 weeks after initiation of interferon therapy. No serious side effects were seen during the trial period. Loss of HBeAg was seen in 39% (7/18), HBV DNA was undetectable in 50% (9/18), and ALT was normal in 56% 10/18) of patients six months after completion of therapy. Simultaneous administration of interferon-a and HBsAg vaccination in patients previously not responding to interferon alone appears to be safe, well-tolerated, and it achieved response rates similar to or even higher than interferon in treatment naive patients. This combination therapy seems to offer a new and promising approach for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection."
2630,0.005,1.0000,"In the five-year period between 1989 and 1993, 87 needlestick accidents occurred among healthcare workers at our hospital. Thirty-seven (43%) of these needlestick accidents involved blood contaminated with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and two of them (5.4%) led to the occurrence of hepatitis C infection. Case 1 was a 43-year-old nurse who was accidentally injured by a needle contaminated with blood from a patient who had cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma due to hepatitis C. Acute hepatitis C occurred after five weeks and HCV RNA was positive after eight weeks. Case 2 was a 33-year-old nurse who was injured by a needle contaminated with blood from a patient who had chronic hepatitis C. Liver function was normal at 11 days after the accident. However, hepatitis C was diagnosed 21 months later after she had successfully given birth to her baby. The nucleotide sequence of the HCV E2/NS1 region was determined in the two patients and the needlestick victims, and phylogenetic trees were constructed by molecular evolutionary analysis. On the basis of these trees, transmission of HCV could be confirmed in both cases. This method of analysis may be useful for confirming the transmission of HCV even long after the event."

To this end, HIV- and herpes virus-specific cellular immune responses were measured longitudinally in 10 seroconverters with long-term follow-up including 55 months of successful suppression of viral load by HAART. HIV- and CMV-specific CD4+ T cells producing interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) or interleukin-2 (IL-2) were analysed as well as proliferative capacity. EBV-specific CD4+ T cells were determined using a 12-day ex vivo assay. Initiation of HAART resulted in a transient increase of HIV-specific IL-2(+)IFNgamma(+)CD4(+) T cells and, to a lesser extent, IL-2(+)CD4(+) T cells. Long-term HAART resulted in an increase in HIV-, CMV- and EBV-specific CD4+ T-cell proliferative capacity. The increase in HIV- and herpes-virus-specific CD4+ T-cell proliferative capacity after 55 months of HAART suggests that the improved proliferative response is not specific for HIV, but reflects a more general improvement of antiviral immune responses, which is induced by HAART."

9618,0.005,1.0000,"Certain immunological parameters (i.e. low CD4+ T cell numbers, high serum soluble CD8) have been described as prognostic factors for the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to later clinical stages. In the present study we have found in one hundred HIV-infected Spanish patients (81% drug abusers, 7% homosexuals, 6% heterosexuals, and 6% other or unknown risk groups) that CD11b+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells are increased in those with persistent lymphadenopathy as compared to other clinical stages (asymptomatic, AIDS-related complex and AIDS). Serum IgA was significantly increased in AIDS patients, and in patients at any other clinical stage who had concomitant infections (mainly mycobacterial and fungal). CD11b (an integrin with complement receptor functions) may thus be of clinical interest for the staging of HIV-infected patients, and reflect stage-selective immunological changes in mononuclear cell biology during HIV infection. High IgA on the other hand, would be a marker of concomitant infection as well as of disease progression. The results concern mostly drug addicts (the main risk group in Spain), but may apply to the other risk groups because no significant differences were detected between drug addicts (n = 81) and non-drug addicts (n = 19) for the studied variables (p greater than 0.05)."
72,0.005,1.0000,"Serum levels of interleukin-7 (IL-7), a non-redundant cytokine that plays a crucial role in lymphopoiesis, are known to be elevated in HIV-1-infected subjects. To examine further the association between levels of IL-7, CD4+ cell counts and viraemia, we analysed these parameters in a large cohort of HIV-1 patients along with serum levels of 90K, a marker of disease severity but with no established involvement in lymphopoiesis. While IL-7 levels were only found to correlate with CD4+ cell counts, 90K levels presented strong correlations with both CD4+ cell numbers and with plasma viral loads (VLs). These correlations were maintained in patients naive to treatment with antiretrovirals (n = 38) but were abolished when the analysis was restricted to the group receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART, n = 82). Moreover, although 90K levels were significantly reduced in patients on HAART, IL-7 levels continued to be elevated despite successful treatment. The influence of HAART on the variations in these serum parameters was further assessed in a longitudinal study on 32 subjects. The HAART-induced decrease in VLs and increase in CD4+ counts were found to correlate with a reduced serum level of 90K and IL-7, respectively. Nevertheless, following a median period of 33 months of immunological and virological successful HAART, serum levels of IL-7 continued to be significantly elevated compared with those detected in healthy controls. These findings suggest that immunotherapy with IL-7, aimed to replenish T-cell stock in HAART-treated subjects, may have a limited impact on the process of immune reconstitution."

After 24 hours of activation of mononuclear cells with plasmas it was demonstrated that as compared with control groups, in of plasmas of patients with highly active antiviral therapy increasing of number of CD4+ T-cells and decreasing of CD8+ T-cells is observed. The plasmas of patients with highly active antiviral therapy activate in most instances CD4+ T-cells whereas plasmas of patients without treatment--CD8+ T-cells. The results of detection of cytokines in blood indicate that in patients without treatment inflammatory potential is increased as compared with group of highly active antiviral therapy. The data concerning accumulation of interleukin-1Œ≤ under cultivation of mononuclear cells with plasmas indicates at its role in preservation of vitality of natural killers. The analysis of immunomodulatory activity of plasma of patients infected with human HIV virus can be recommended as an additional technique of evaluation of functioning of immune system."

1977,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to investigate whether the restored immune functions of vertically human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children who were severely immunodeficient before the initiation of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) are comparable to those of untreated slow progressors. We therefore assessed T cell proliferation and cytokine [interferon (IFN)-Œ≥, interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13] secretions after mitogen, recall antigens and HIV-1-specific stimulation in 12 untreated slow progressors, 16 untreated progressors and 18 treated patients. Treated children were profoundly immunodeficient before the initiation of HAART and had long-lasting suppression of viral replication on treatment. We demonstrated that slow progressors are characterized not only by the preservation of HIV-1-specific lymphoproliferative responses but also by the fact that these responses are clearly T helper type 1 (Th1)-polarized. Children on HAART had proliferative responses to HIV-1 p24 antigen, purified protein derivative (PPD) and tetanus antigen similar to slow progressors and higher than those of progressors. However, in contrast to slow progressors, most treated children exhibited a release of Th2 cytokines accompanying the IFN-Œ≥ secretion in response to the HIV-1 p24 antigen. Moreover, despite higher proliferative responses to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) than the two groups of untreated children, treated children had lower levels of IFN-Œ≥ secretion in response to PHA than slow progressors. These data show that in severely immunodeficient vertically HIV-infected children, a long-lasting HAART allows recovering lymphoproliferative responses similar to untreated slow progressors. However, alterations in IFN-Œ≥ secretion in response to the mitogen PHA persisted, and their cytokine release after HIV-specific stimulation was biased towards a Th2 response."

The major histocompatibility complex class I allele group human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*57 is overrepresented in this population. Mutations in HLA-B*57-restricted epitopes have been observed in ES, but their significance has remained unclear. Here we investigate the extent and impact of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations in HLA-B*57+ ES. We provide the first direct evidence that most ES experience chronic low level viremia. Sequencing revealed a striking discordance between the genotypes of plasma virus and archived provirus in resting CD4+ T cells. Mutations in HLA-B*57-restricted Gag epitopes were present in all viruses from plasma but were rare in proviruses, suggesting powerful selective pressure acting at these epitopes. Surprisingly, strong CD8+ T cell interferon-gamma responses were detected against some mutant epitopes found in plasma virus, suggesting the development of de novo responses to viral variants. In some individuals, relative CD8+ T cell interleukin-2 responses showed better correlation with the selection observed in vivo. Thus, analysis of low level viremia reveals an unexpectedly high level of CTL escape mutations reflecting selective pressure acting at HLA-B*57-restricted epitopes in ES. Continued viral suppression probably reflects CTL responses against unmutated epitopes and residual or de novo responses against epitopes with escape mutations."

Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the correlates of prevalent disability in adults ‚â•50 years with HIV infection. A cross-sectional study of 184 HIV-infected adults receiving ambulatory care in an HIV clinic of a tertiary care, university-affiliated hospital in Mexico City was conducted. Disability for instrumental (IADL) and basic activities of daily living (ADL) was established. Sociodemographic factors, clinical variables, current CD4(+) cell count, and HIV viral load (VL) were tested as potential determinants of disability. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the correlates of both types of disability. The mean age was 59.3 years. All participants were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Of participants 17.9% had disability for IADL and 26.1% for ADL. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that being older; having a lower CD4(+) cell count, and having a detectable HIV VL were independently associated with both types of disability. In addition, educational level was also independently associated with ADL disability. Age, educational level, low CD4(+) cell count, and detectable HIV VL were independently associated with disability. Whether effective and timely antiretroviral therapy will reduce the risk of disability in HIV-infected elderly patients needs to be evaluated. "
2781,0.005,1.0000,Little is known about HIV-1 drug resistance (HIVDR) in people failing first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in Vietnam. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and determine correlates of acquiring genotypic HIVDR among Vietnamese adults (age ‚â• 18) who met the immunological or clinical criteria of first-line HAART failure according to the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO).
1937,0.005,1.0000,"Lesotho, a small, mountainous country completely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa, has a population of approximately 2 million persons with an estimated gross national income of $1,280 per capita; 73% of the population resides in rural areas (1). Lesotho has a generalized human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic (2). In 2014, the prevalence of HIV infection among persons aged 15-49 years was 24.6%, with an incidence of 1.9 new infections per 100 person-years of exposure (3). As the leading cause of premature death, HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) has contributed to Lesotho's reporting the shortest life expectancy at birth among 195 countries and territories (4). In 2015, antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage among HIV-positive persons in Lesotho was estimated to be 42% (5). In April 2016, Lesotho became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to adopt the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for universal initiation of antiretroviral therapy for all HIV-positive persons, regardless of CD4 count (known as the ""Test and Start"" program or approach), with nationwide implementation occurring in June 2016 (6,7). Before implementation of Test and Start, many persons living with HIV infection in Lesotho were not eligible to initiate treatment until their CD4 count was <500 cells/mm"
3028,0.005,1.0000,"Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the risk of drug-sensitive HIV transmission but may increase the transmission of drug-resistant HIV. We used a mathematical model to estimate the long-term population-level benefits of ART and determine the scenarios under which earlier ART (treatment at 1 year post-infection, on average) could decrease simultaneously both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence (new infections). We constructed an infection-age-structured mathematical model that tracked the transmission rates over the course of infection and modelled the patients' life expectancy as a function of ART initiation timing. We fitted this model to the annual AIDS incidence and death data directly, and to resistance data and demographic data indirectly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco. Using counterfactual scenarios, we assessed the impact on total and drug-resistant HIV incidence of ART initiation timing, frequency of acquired drug resistance, and second-line drug effectiveness (defined as the combination of resistance monitoring, biomedical drug efficacy and adherence). Earlier ART initiation could decrease the number of both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence when second-line drug effectiveness is sufficiently high (greater than 80%), but increase the proportion of new infections that are drug resistant. Thus, resistance may paradoxically appear to be increasing while actually decreasing."
4420,0.005,1.0000,"The central nervous system (CNS) was studied in 252 HIV-infected patients from the States of Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo in Brazil, the regions with the highest incidence of AIDS in the country. We compared the frequency and morphology of opportunistic infections and CNS changes caused by the HIV, with those described in other series and briefly analysed the risk factors involved in our cases. There were CNS lesions in 230 cases (91.3%), 30 (11.9%) with multiple infections and/or tumours. Most infections were opportunistic (65.4%), including 15.4% viral and 50% bacterial, fungal or protozoal infections. The most frequent was toxoplasmosis (34.1%), followed by cryptococcosis (13.5%), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (7.9%) and nodular encephalitis (6.7%). Primary lymphomas were observed in 4% of the cases and HIV encephalitis or leukoencephalopathy in 10.7%. Other opportunistic and HIV associated lesions were present in a limited number of cases and there were also vascular and non-specific lesions. Our study confirms the high frequency of CNS lesions in HIV infected patients. They are morphologically similar to those previously described. However, the higher incidence of toxoplasmosis and cryptococcosis, a lower incidence of viral opportunistic and HIV-associated lesions, and the presence of rarer lesions such as histoplasmosis and chagasic encephalitis, differ from other series, and may reflect geographical and/or socio-economic factors."
233,0.005,1.0000,"Pneumocystis pneumonia is a potentially life-threatening pulmonary infection that occurs in immunocompromised individuals and HIV-infected patients with a low CD4 cell count. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been used as the first-line agent for treatment, but mutations within dihydropteroate synthase gene render potential resistance to sulfamide. Despite advances of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), Pneumocystis pneumonia continues to occur in HIV-infected patients with late presentation for cART or virological and immunological failure after receiving cART. Areas covered: This review summarizes the diagnosis and first-line and alternative treatment and prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-infected patients. Articles for this review were identified through searching PubMed. Search terms included: 'Pneumocystis pneumonia', 'Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia', 'Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia', 'trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'primaquine', 'trimetrexate', 'dapsone', 'pentamidine', 'atovaquone', 'echinocandins', 'human immunodeficiency virus infection', 'acquired immunodeficiency syndrome', 'resistance to sulfamide' and combinations of these terms. We limited the search to English language papers that were published between 1981 and March 2017. We screened all identified articles and cross-referenced studies from retrieved articles. Expert commentary: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole will continue to be the first-line agent for Pneumocystis pneumonia given its cost, availability of both oral and parenteral formulations, and effectiveness or efficacy in both treatment and prophylaxis. Whether resistance due to mutations within dihydropteroate synthase gene compromises treatment effectiveness remains controversial. Continued search for effective alternatives with better safety profiles for Pneumocystis pneumonia is warranted."
5297,0.005,1.0000,"The presence of immunoreactivity to the neuronal phosphoprotein B-50 and the peptides bombesin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, galanin, neurotensin, neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, substance P, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide was examined in biopsy specimens from the duodenum and rectum of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and HIV-seronegative male homosexual patients. The distribution of B-50 and the peptides was correlated with HIV serology, number of CD4+ lymphocytes, and the presence of HIV in biopsy culture. There was a very low incidence of enteric pathogens in both groups of patients. It was found that HIV-seropositive patients had a greater incidence of abnormal patterns of immunoreactivity (reduced intensity and/or density of innervation) in enteric nerves and enteroendocrine cells than HIV-seronegative patients. A reduction of substance P immunoreactivity was significantly correlated with reduced CD4+ lymphocyte count and HIV status; a similar trend was also seen for somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. Using B-50 as a marker, it was found that both groups of patients had altered patterns of immunoreactivity in rectal nerves. The findings of this study suggest that some of the clinical symptoms associated with HIV infection may be caused by a specific HIV enteropathy that influences enteric nerve and/or enteroendocrine cell function by altering the density of peptide immunoreactivity."
8223,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of the two year (2003-2005) study was to study the HIV prevalence among high risk behavior groups of persons with Herpes Zoster infection. For this purpose we have investigated the high risk group patients: 1257 prisoners (1st group), 1543 IDUs (2nd group) and 1350 persons including: homosexuals, persons with history of frequent unprotected sex and persons with hepatitis B and C (3rd group). We revealed the persons with current or previous history of Herpes Zoster, and studied HIV prevalence among them. Besides, we have studied the immune status of revealed HIV positive persons, relationship between disease (Herpes Zoster) severity and CD4 count. Herpes Zoster infection was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, anamnesis and by detection of VZV specific IgM and IgG by ELISA. HIV infection was diagnosed by ELISA method and was confirmed by Western Blot. CD4 count was detected by immunophenotyping technique and was analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. The total prevalence of HIV infection among high risk behavior group persons with Herpes Zoster infection was 18,9% (31 HIV cases out of 164). The disease (Herpes Zoster) severity and duration was associated with decreased rate of cellular immunity, CD4 count. Herpes Zoster has a positive predictive value for HIV infection, predominantly recurrent Herpes Zoster. Herpes Zoster should be recognized as a marker condition indicating the necessity of screening for HIV, especially in Georgia, the region where the problem of IDU exists."
3284,0.005,1.0000,"Improvements in HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been accompanied by increasing recognition of the importance of adherence to treatment regimens for maximizing patient benefits while minimizing the emergence of drug-resistant virus. Whether clinicians should screen patients for adherence and only administer therapy to those believed likely to adhere has not been resolved. We first examine the implications of data drawn from a recent study reporting physicians' ability to predict whether patients will adhere to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or not. We then extend previously developed mathematical models of ART to include screening for adherence and focus on resulting drug resistance as well as on HIV and AIDS incidence at the population level. We show that although screening for adherence is likely to reduce the level of drug resistance compared with a policy of treating all HIV patients with HAART, rates of new HIV infections and AIDS cases in the population would likely increase unless screening accuracy is extremely (perhaps implausibly) high."
2231,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been associated with increased rates of single- and multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis in the New York City area. In order to examine the relationship of HIV infection to drug-resistant tuberculosis in other selected regions of the United States, we established a registry of cases of culture-proven tuberculosis. Data were collected from sites participating in an NIH-funded, community-based HIV clinical trials group. All cases of tuberculosis, regardless of HIV status, which occurred between January 1992 and June 1994 were recorded. Overall, 1,373 cases of tuberculosis were evaluated, including 425 from the New York City area, and 948 from seven other metropolitan areas. The overall prevalence of resistance to one or more drugs was 20.4%, and 5.6% of isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (MDR). In the New York City area, HIV-infected patients were significantly more likely than persons not known to be HIV-infected, to have resistance to at least one drug (37% versus 19%) and MDR (19% versus 6%). In other geographic areas, overall drug resistance was 16%, and only 2.2% of isolates were MDR. In multiple logistic regression analyses, HIV infection was shown to be a risk factor for drug-resistant tuberculosis, independent of geographic location, history of prior therapy, age, and race. We concluded that HIV infection is associated with increased rates of resistance to antituberculosis drugs in both the New York City area and other geographic areas. MDR tuberculosis is occurring predominantly in the New York City area and is highly correlated with HIV infection."
7682,0.005,1.0000,"Attempts to address the significant impact of HAART on medical variables on the Malaysian HIV/AIDS population have yet to be evaluated. This study aims to analyze the proportions of AIDS-defining illnesses (ADIs) before and after HAART. A retrospective study was carried out on 128 new cases of HIV infected patients who first commenced HAART in 2004 at the national HIV reference center. Before commencement of HAART, 76 clinical episodes of ADIs were recorded in 52 patients. Most common being pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (28.9%), PCP (27.6%) and disseminated and extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (11.8%). During HAART, 8 clinical episodes of ADIs were documented in 7 patients with a median time of onset of 10 weeks after initiation of HAART (range, 4-36 weeks). The median CD4 count at the time of the commencement of HAART for these patients was 11 cells/mm(3). ADIs reported include PCP (2 episodes), disseminated and extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2 episodes), extrapulmonary cryptococcosis (1 episode), esophageal candidiasis (1 episode), recurrent pneumonia (1 episode) and disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis (1 episode). Three (37.5%) of these occurred despite a reduction of viral load by at least 2 log(10) and an increased in the CD4 cell count. In conclusion, ADIs can still present after the initiation of successful HAART especially in those with CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm(3). In Malaysia, ADIs are the major causes of HIV/AIDS associated morbidity and mortality, thus increased awareness on the management of these illnesses is warranted especially in the months following HAART."
6191,0.005,1.0000,"In a retrospective study of 476 surgical orthopedic trauma patients, we compared postoperative infection rates between individuals seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and with no associated clinical symptoms with HIV-seronegative patients. Overall, the surgical postoperative infection rate was 16.7% in seropositive patients and 5.4% in the seronegative group (Chi-square, p = 0.035). When open fractures were considered separately, the seropositive group had a 55.6% infection rate compared with 11.3% in the seronegative group (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.004). Similarly, seropositive patients also had significantly increased rates of postoperative non-wound infections and complications (Chi-square p < 0.001). Asymptomatic HIV-seropositive orthopedic trauma patients are at significantly higher risk for postoperative infections than their seronegative counterparts. For HIV-seropositive patients with open fractures, this risk is especially pronounced."
9636,0.005,1.0000,"The post-transplant immune responses, viremia, and allograft histology after living donor liver transplantation were studied in 39 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected recipients. The recipients were classified into the following groups according to a hierarchical clustering of their preoperative CD8CD45 T-cell isoforms: group I, naive-dominant; group II, effector memory-dominant; and group III, effector-dominant. Plasma HCV-RNA rapidly increased and then peaked as an initial burst around postoperative day (POD) 25 in group I, on POD 40 in group II, and on POD 55 in group III. The initial burst of viremia was suppressed by the high expression of CD8+CD28-CD27- subsets. The progression of fibrosis > or =F2 was significantly more frequent for those patients with the highest viremia levels. Moreover, the initial T-cell immune response became less important throughout time, and new immune responses emerged after 2 months that modified the host-virus interaction. It is suggested that the interferon (IFN)-alpha/ribavirin therapy starting 2 months may be an effective option and now is undertaken."
9531,0.005,1.0000,"We assessed the impact of an efavirenz-containing regimen versus a protease inhibitor-containing regimen on quality of life, emotional status, and adherence of HIV-1-infected patients. In addition, we sought to define the adverse events associated with these treatments, with a special focus on central nervous system disorders in the efavirenz treatment group. This prospective, randomized, two-arm, controlled study included 100 patients for whom initial treatment with a protease inhibitor-containing regimen failed. Patients were randomized to start treatment with two nucleoside retrotranscriptase inhibitors plus efavirenz (group 1; 51 patients) or two nucleoside retrotranscriptase inhibitors plus one or more new protease inhibitors (group 2; 49 patients). Quality of life was assessed by a five-point item adapted from the HIV questionnaire of the Medical Outcomes Study, emotional status was evaluated by the Profile of Mood State questionnaire, and patients self-reported adherence. Data were analyzed by both an as-treated method and an intention-to-treat-last observation carried forward method. Patients in group 1 reported the following findings at week 4: dizziness (66%), abnormal dreaming (48%), light-headedness (37%), and difficulty sleeping (35%). At week 24, dizziness (13%; p <.001), abnormal dreaming (18%; p =.002), light-headedness (13%; p =.01), difficulty sleeping (7%; p =.001), and nervousness (13%; p =.01) decreased in these patients. Irritability, abnormal dreaming, and nervousness persisted at week 48 in 13%, 10%, and 8% of group 1 patients, respectively. Patients in group 2 reported the following findings at week 4: light-headedness (8%), dizziness (5%), difficulty sleeping (4%), nervousness (4%), and headaches (3%). Patients in group 2 reported the following findings at week 48: difficulty sleeping (4%), nervousness (3%), headaches (3%), and light-headedness (2%). In group 1, quality of life (p <.001) and emotional status (week 48; p =.004) improved, both of which were better than those in group 2 (p =.001). Both groups maintained high levels of medication adherence, and no significant differences in the number of patients who had viral loads of <200 copies/mL at week 48 were found (78% of group 1 patients vs. 85% of group 2 patients; p = not significant). At week 48, the mean CD4 cell count +/- SD was 497 +/- 224/mm3 in group 1 and 539 +/- 298/mm3 in group 2 (p = not significant). Despite similar immunologic and virologic outcomes, a second-line efavirenz-containing regimen improved quality of life of HIV-1-infected patients compared with a second-line protease inhibitor-containing regimen. However, close follow-up of patients receiving treatment with efavirenz-based regimens is recommended, especially for those with previous emotional disturbances due to central nervous system disorders in the short term and those with persistence of a low percentage of these disorders in the long term."
6397,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatotoxicity due to antituberculosis drugs limits treatment in patients coinfected with HIV and tuberculosis. We conducted a case-control study to identify risk factors for hepatotoxicity among patients coinfected with tuberculosis and HIV in two hospitals in Recife, Pernambuco State, Brazil. The sample consisted of 57 patients (36.5% of the total) who developed hepatotoxicity and a control group of 99 patients (63.5% of the total), who did not present this effect. Hepatotoxicity consisted of jaundice or a high concentration of AST/ALT or total bilirubinemia. Multivariate logistic regression showed that a T CD4+ count of < 200 cells/mm(3) increased the risk of hepatotoxicity by a factor of 1.233 (p < 0.001) and that coinfection with hepatitis B or C virus increased this risk by a factor of 18.187 (p = 0.029). Discharge occurred among 66.1% of the case group (p = 0.026). The absence of hepatotoxicity was a protective factor against death (OR = 0.42; 95%CI: 0.20-0.91). Coinfection with the B and C hepatitis virus and a T CD4+ cell count below 200 cells/mm(3) were independent risk factors for hepatotoxicity in these patients."
8731,0.005,1.0000,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural cellular mechanism to silence gene expression and is predominantly mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs) that target messenger RNA. Viruses can manipulate the cellular processes necessary for their replication by targeting the host RNAi machinery. This study explores the effect of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) transactivating protein Tax on the RNAi pathway in the context of a chromosomally integrated viral long terminal repeat (LTR) using a CD4(+) T-cell line, Jurkat. Transcription factor profiling of the HTLV-1 LTR stably integrated T-cell clone transfected with Tax demonstrates increased activation of substrates and factors associated with chromatin remodeling complexes. Using a miRNA microarray and bioinformatics experimental approach, Tax was also shown to downregulate the expression of miRNAs associated with the translational regulation of factors required for chromatin remodeling. These observations were validated with selected miRNAs and an HTLV-1 infected T cells line, MT-2. miR-149 and miR-873 were found to be capable of directly targeting p300 and p/CAF, chromatin remodeling factors known to play critical role in HTLV-1 pathogenesis. Overall, these results are first in line establishing HTLV-1/Tax-miRNA-chromatin concept and open new avenues toward understanding retroviral latency and/or replication in a given cell type."
687,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of the study was to determine the predisposing factors and incidence of toxicity among AIDS patients treated with a nevirapine (NVP)-based regimen in clinical practice. A retrospective cohort study of representative samples of AIDS patients treated with a NVP-based regimen was performed. A total of 206 adult HIV/AIDS cases with median age (IQR) 33 years (range, 29-38 years), 51% male, treated between January 2004-December 2005, were included. Most (92.2%) of the patients were na√Øve to antiretroviral drug. The incidence of NVP toxicity was 1.09/100 person-months. The median onset time was 4 weeks post NVP initiation (2.57 weeks for skin toxicity and 12.43 weeks for hepatic toxicity). History of drug allergy and NVP toxicity were significantly associated (p = 0.006), as were sulfamethoxazole allergy and toxicity (p = 0.015). Regarding concomitant medication, concurrent anti-tuberculosis drugs significantly increased the risk of NVP associated liver toxicity (p = 0.001). Therefore, it is important to monitor adverse events from NVP, including liver function tests among HIV/AIDS patients with history of drug allergy, especially against sulfamethoxazole, and those concurrently treated with antituberculosis drugs."

In this study involving subjects from eastern Turkey, the frequencies of HLA-B35, HLA-CW4, HLA-DQ2, and HLA-DQ8 were markedly higher in the chronic HBV group than those in the spontaneously recovered group; the frequencies of HLA-A11 and HLA-A24 in the nonresponsive HBV vaccine group were markedly higher than those in the responsive HBV vaccine group; and the frequency of HLA-CW6 in the nonresponsive HBV vaccine group was significantly lower than in the responsive group. A complete understanding of HLA types associated with the progression to chronic HBV infection and their effects within the cell at the molecular level will be an important contribution in the development of new HBV vaccines and new treatment strategies for chronic HBV infection."
5223,0.005,1.0000,Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection for whom prior treatment of HCV with interferon-ribavirin has failed may require subsequent treatment with new HCV protease inhibitors (PIs). We evaluated the diversity of HCV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) in 26 HCV- and HIV-coinfected patients receiving stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) who were treated with interferon-ribavirin. Plasma HCV RNA clonal analysis was performed. There was greater baseline NS3 diversity in patients with nonresponse or relapse than in those with sustained virologic response. Interferon-ribavirin treatment did not result in significant changes in HCV protease gene diversity or significant HCV PI resistance mutations. The effect of prior interferon-ribavirin treatment on HCV NS3 will likely not impact HCV PI efficacy in HIV-coinfected patients receiving ART.
8537,0.005,1.0000,"It is estimated that, in the United States and Europe, 15-30% of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Among these patients, approximately 80% are intravenous drug users (IVDU), 71% are hemophiliacs, and around 20% are homosexual/bi-sexual men. HIV infection accelerates the natural history of HCV infection. On the contrary, highly active antiretroviral therapy reduces the rate of mortality due to liver disease by immune restoration. Since having HIV implies being at risk also for HCV as both infections can be acquired in similar ways, all individuals with the former should be screened for the latter. Loss of antibodies against HCV in HIV-seropositive IVDU has been shown. Thus, quantitative tests determining HCV-RNA levels in blood are currently being employed for diagnosis confirmation in case of an obvious ''risk group''. Since HIV can progress more rapidly than HCV, it may be preferable to treat HIV first. The 2007 recommendations from HCV-HIV International Panel indicate current treatment of HCV in coinfected patients with pegylated formulation of interferon at standard doses plus weight based ribavirin. The treatment duration should be evaluated on the basis of HCV genotype. Liver transplantation is a most debated issue when dealing with HCV/HIV coinfected subjects. Mortality among HIV-infected liver transplant recipients is similar to that of age and race-matched HIV-negative controls. The present concise review attempts to highlight on the current clinical situation on HIV/HCV coinfection."
5277,0.005,1.0000,"Background. Aboriginal Canadians face many lifestyle risk factors for hepatitis C exposure. Methods. An analysis of Ottawa Hospital Viral Hepatitis Clinic (Ottawa, Canada) patients between January 2000 and August 2013 was performed. HCV infection risk factors and HCV treatment outcomes were assessed. Socioeconomic status markers were based on area-level indicators linked to postal codes using administrative databases. Results. 55 (2.8%) Aboriginal and 1923 (97.2%) non-Aboriginal patients were evaluated. Aboriginals were younger (45.6 versus 49.6 years, p < 0.01). The distribution of gender (63.6% versus 68.3% male), HIV coinfection (9.1% versus 8.1%), advanced fibrosis stage (29.2% versus 28.0%), and SVR (56.3% versus 58.9%) was similar between groups. Aboriginals had a higher number of HCV risk factors, (mean 4.2 versus 3.1, p < 0.001) with an odds ratio of 2.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.4-4.4) for having 4+ risk factors. This was not explained after adjustment for income, social deprivation, and poor housing. Aboriginal status was not related to SVR. Aboriginals interrupted therapy more often due to loss to follow-up, poor adherence, and substance abuse (25.0% versus 4.6%). Conclusion. Aboriginal Canadians have higher levels of HCV risk factors, even when adjusting for socioeconomic markers. Despite facing greater barriers to care, SVR rates were comparable with non-Aboriginals. "
1767,0.005,1.0000,"A new RNA virus, designated GBV-C/hepatitis G virus (HGV) has been identified recently. To evaluate the prevalence of GBV-C/HGV infection among Egyptians, five groups were enrolled in this study: group I, healthy blood donors (82); group II, health care personnel (30); group III, chronic non-B non-C hepatitis patients (63); group IV, chronic hepatitis C patients (100); group V, renal dialysis patients (79). GBV-C/HGV-RNA was detected by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers derived from 5'-non coding region of GBV-C/HGV. GBV-C/HGV-RNA was detected in 57 of 354 tested sera with an overall prevalence of 16.1%. Meanwhile, isolated GBV-C/HGV infection was detected in 16/57 (28.1%), GBV-C/HGV coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 37/57 (64.9%) and with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 4/57 (7.6%) of cases. The highest prevalence was encountered among dialysis patients reaching 30% followed by chronic hepatitis C (14%), blood donors (12.2%), chronic non-B non-C hepatitis (11.1%), whereas the lowest prevalence rate of 6.6% was detected among health care personnel. Nucleotide sequence analysis in three Egyptians confirmed that these PCR products were derived from GBV-C/HGV genome and all isolates classified into US/European type (type 2) of GBV-C/HGV genotypes. The risk factors of all cases were non-transfusion parenteral exposure, e.g. reusing syringes, dental treatment, surgery, invasive medical maneuvers, with an exception of renal dialysis patients who have had repeated blood transfusion. It is concluded that there is a relatively high prevalence of GBV-C/HGV-RNA among different Egyptian groups compared to international figures. The main risk factors were direct percutaneous exposure rather than blood transfusion. The Egyptian GBV-C/HGV isolates are very similar to the American isolate PNF 2161."

Mutations in the pol gene of HBV, either from selection of primary or secondary resistance mutations, typically result in changes in the overlapping hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Recent studies have conferred a new acronym to these HBV pol/S gene overlap mutants: ADAPVEMs, for antiviral drug-associated potential vaccine-escape mutants. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence and pattern of ADAPVEMs in Turkish patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB)."
3792,0.005,1.0000,"To define the extent of sequence conservation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) in vivo, the first 320 amino acids of RT obtained from 2,236 plasma-derived samples from a well-defined cohort of 1,704 HIV-1-infected individuals (457 drug na√Øve and 1,247 drug treated) were analyzed and examined in structural terms. In na√Øve patients, 233 out of these 320 residues (73%) were conserved (<1% variability). The majority of invariant amino acids clustered into defined regions comprising between 5 and 29 consecutive residues. Of the nine longest invariant regions identified, some contained residues and domains critical for enzyme stability and function. In patients treated with RT inhibitors, despite profound drug pressure and the appearance of mutations primarily associated with resistance, 202 amino acids (63%) remained highly conserved and appeared mostly distributed in regions of variable length. This finding suggests that participation of consecutive residues in structural domains is strictly required for cooperative functions and sustainability of HIV-1 RT activity. Besides confirming the conservation of amino acids that are already known to be important for catalytic activity, stability of the heterodimer interface, and/or primer/template binding, the other 62 new invariable residues are now identified and mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. This new knowledge could be of help in the structure-based design of novel resistance-evading drugs."
2866,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate cellular factors involved in HIV-1 chronic infection, three cell lines chronically infected with the same HIV-1 viral isolate (s61) were studied by cDNA microarray analysis. Two T cell lines, H61 and M61, showed the characteristics of a persistent infection whereas U61 cell line displayed a latent infection pattern. Analysis of genes with altered expression in the three cell lines revealed evidence of apoptosis control by up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes. In addition, cell cycle control was affected in the two persistent T cell lines particularly through the down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A/p21). Moreover, each cell line showed specific characteristics, like in M61 cells, genes related with cellular activation and with cell migration and motility. In U61 cells, genes associated with immune response were activated. Genes with altered expression in our experiments, and not previously related with HIV such as ANXA 1 or CFLAR were detected and validated. This work revealed that different cell mechanism such as control of apoptosis and cell cycle are important for ""in vitro"" HIV-1 chronic infections, and discovered new genes previously not related with HIV-1 replication."
8572,0.005,1.0000,"HIV infection is the major public health, social and economic problem in Georgia. The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of ARV treatment system in Georgia. Study included 1052 people living with HIV/AIDS in Georgia registered at Infectious Disease, AIDS and Clinical Immunology Research Center since 2004. To ensure universal access to ARV therapy all HIV/AIDS individuals included in the study were investigated by special algorithm, all identified patients requiring ARV therapy were offered treatment and monitored during therapy on treatment effectiveness and side effects. Detection of HIV antibodies was performed by ELISA with further confirmation by Western Blot Assay. HIV-1 RNA in plasma was measured by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction. For determination of percentages and absolute count of T lymphocyte subpopulations single-platform immunophenotyping technique using the Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer was applied. For resistance testing TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit with the OpenGene DNA Sequencing System (Siemens) was used. Treatment was offered to 595 HIV/AIDS patients. 594 patients started treatment, 1 patient refused. Out of treated 594 HIV/AIDS patients 22 patients discontinued, 111 patients died and 461 patients are currently on ARV treatment. Out of treated patients 406 adults and 21 children are receiving first-line treatment, 31 adults and 2 children are on second-line treatment and 1 adult is receiving salvage regimen. Treatment failure was defined in 55 cases. Among them immunological failure was observed in 7 cases, clinical failure in 1 case and virologic failure in 47 cases. Prevalence of drug resistance among virologic failure cases accounted for 72% and inadequate adherence for 28% cases. Majority of death cases among ARV treated patients was due to non-AIDS related or incurable conditions, while deaths due to AIDS related conditions mainly were associated to the delayed referral of patients in already advanced stage of disease. It's worth to mention that highest number of death cases was due to liver failure in HIV/HCV and/or HBV co-infected patients."
5987,0.005,1.0000,"Polymorphisms in CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), the major coreceptor of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), have a major influence on HIV-1 transmission and disease progression. The effects of these polymorphisms may, in part, account for the differential pathogenesis of HIV-1 (immunosuppression) and SIV (natural resistance) in humans and non-human primates, respectively. Thus, understanding the genetic basis underlying species-specific responses to HIV-1 and SIV could reveal new anti-HIV-1 therapeutic strategies for humans. To this end, we compared CCR5 structure/evolution and regulation among humans, apes, Old World Monkeys, and New World Monkeys. The evolution of the CCR5 cis-regulatory region versus the open reading frame as well as among different domains of the open reading frame differed from one another. CCR5 cis-regulatory region sequence variation in humans was substantially higher than anticipated. Based on this variation, CCR5 haplotypes could be organized into seven evolutionarily distinct human haplogroups (HH) that we designated HHA, -B, -C, -D, -E, -F, and -G. HHA haplotypes were defined as ancestral to all other haplotypes by comparison to the CCR5 haplotypes of non-human primates. Different human and non-human primate CCR5 haplotypes were associated with differential transcriptional regulation, and various polymorphisms resulted in modified DNA-nuclear protein interactions, including altered binding of members of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors. We identified novel CCR5 untranslated mRNA sequences that were conserved in human and non-human primates. In some primates, mutations at exon-intron boundaries caused loss of expression of selected CCR5 mRNA isoforms or production of novel mRNA isoforms. Collectively, these findings suggest that the response to HIV-1 and SIV infection in primates may have been driven, in part, by evolution of the elements controlling CCR5 transcription and translation."
4633,0.005,1.0000,"GV-TH-01, a Phase 1 open-label trial of a DNA prime‚ÄîModified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) boost vaccine (GOVX-B11), was undertaken in HIV infected participants on antiretroviral treatment (ART) to evaluate safety and vaccine-elicited T cell responses, and explore the ability of elicited CD8+ T cells to control viral rebound during analytical treatment interruption (TI). Nine men who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 18 months of seroconversion and had sustained plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for at least 6 months were enrolled. Median age was 38 years, median pre-ART HIV-1 RNA was 140,000 copies/ml and mean baseline CD4 count was 755/Œºl. Two DNA, followed by 2 MVA, inoculations were given 8 weeks apart. Eight subjects completed all vaccinations and TI. Clinical and laboratory adverse events were generally mild, with no serious or grade 4 events. Only reactogenicity events were considered related to study drug. No treatment emergent viral resistance was seen. The vaccinations did not reduce viral reservoirs and virus re-emerged in all participants during TI, with a median time to re-emergence of 4 weeks. Eight of 9 participants had CD8+ T cells that could be stimulated by vaccine-matched Gag peptides prior to vaccination. Vaccinations boosted these responses as well as eliciting previously undetected CD8+ responses. Elicited T cells did not display signs of exhaustion. During TI, temporal patterns of viral re-emergence and Gag-specific CD8+ T cell expansion suggested that vaccine-specific CD8+ T cells had been stimulated by re-emergent virus in only 2 of 8 participants. In these 2, transient decreases in viremia were associated with Gag selection in known CD8+ T cell epitopes. We hypothesize that escape mutations, already archived in the viral reservoir, plus a poor ability of CD8+ T cells to traffic to and control virus at sites of re-emergence, limited the therapeutic efficacy of the DNA/MVA vaccine."
7373,0.005,1.0000,"The dynamics of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcription was analyzed in vitro and in vivo by using a specific molecular approach which allows accurate quantitation of the different classes of viral mRNAs. Unspliced (US) and multiply spliced (MS) HIV-1 transcripts were assayed by competitive reverse transcription (cRT)-PCR, using a single competitor RNA bearing in tandem internally deleted sequences of both template species. Acute HIV-1 infection of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes/macrophages cells, and the A3.01 T-lymphocyte-derived cell line was studied; both classes of HIV-1 mRNAs increased exponentially (r2 > 0.98) at days 1 to 3 and 1 to 4 postinfection in HIV(IIIB)-infected A3.01 cells and PBMCs, respectively, whereas monocytes/macrophages infected with monocytotropic HIV(BaL) exhibited a linear (r2 = 0.81 to 0.94) accumulation of US and MS transcripts. Following induction of chronically infected ACH-2 cells, MS transcripts increased 2 h postinduction and peaked at 5 h (doubling time, 58 min), while at 24 h, US mRNAs increased 3,053-fold compared with basal time (doubling time, 137 min). To address the biopathological significance of HIV-1 expression pattern during infection progression, pilot cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were carried out with samples from untreated and treated HIV-1-infected patients. In almost all untreated (recently infected, long-term nonprogressor, and progressor) patients, MS transcript levels followed the general trend of systemic HIV-1 activity. In patients under treatment with powerful antiretroviral compounds, viral MS transcripts rapidly fell to undetectable levels, indicating that in vivo, levels of MS mRNAs in PBMCs are closely associated with the number of newly infected cells and suggesting a new role for the quantitative analysis of HIV-1 transcription in infected patients."
6426,0.005,1.0000,"Europe is currently observing a significant rise in non-B subtypes. Consequently, the effect of genetic variability on therapy response or genotypic resistance interpretation algorithms is an emerging concern. The purpose of this study is to investigate the amino acid substitutions selected under drug pressure in the protease of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes B and G, and determine if there are any significant differences. We investigated therapy-related and subtype-related substitutions in the protease, considering subtype, overall protease inhibitor treatment and individual drug exposure. Many mutations were significantly related to protease inhibitor (PI) therapy, with mutations exclusive to subtype B or subtype G. Some mutations are at positions related to resistance in both subtypes, but the amino acid substitution is different. Other mutations were significantly associated with subtype and PI selective pressure (p<0.05), pointing towards a differential selective pressure in both subtypes. We confirmed previous reports on the subtype-dependent selection of D30N and 89I, and identified a new mutation with such differential selective pressure: 37D was preferentially selected by lopinavir in subtype B. Other novel mutations found under therapy pressure were 13A, 35N, K55R, I66F, I72L/T, T74S, 82M and 89I/V. Our study indicates that even though in general, drug selective pressure and resistance pathways are relatively similar between subtypes B and G, some differences do occur, leading to subtype-dependent substitutions."
3150,0.005,1.0000,"In a qualitative study, 20 HIV-infected Australian gay men were interviewed about their decision not to access antiretroviral drug therapy. The main reasons given for the decision were fear of side effects; fear of long-term damage to body organs; the inconvenience of the treatment regimens; belief that the regimen's demands would be a threat to morale; and belief that there was no reason to start therapy in the absence of AIDS-related symptoms. Actions taken by the men to monitor and maintain their health included seeing a doctor regularly; having regular T-cell and viral load tests; and trying to maintain a positive outlook by not letting HIV/AIDS 'take over' their lives. Almost half the men considered they had been subjected to unreasonable pressure to access therapy and there was considerable pride at having resisted this pressure. The findings suggest that the men disagreed with the biomedical model for managing HIV/AIDS only on the question of if and when to access therapy. They also suggest that underlying the men's dissent from the biomedical model was a different mode of thinking than is required by the model: while the model demands thinking that is abstract, the men focused strongly on factors close to the 'here and now' of immediate experience. The practical implications of the findings are explored."
7059,0.005,1.0000,"The majority of the HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) testing studies have focused on subtype B virus. The predominance of subtype C in the Indian subcontinent along with greater access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) necessitates studies on HIVDR genotyping. We determined the prevalence of mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) from plasma of 40 antiretroviral drug-naive study participants in Indian HIV-1 pol gene sequences. Of these, 36 sequences belonged to subtype C, two to subtype A1, and two were subtype A1C recombinants. The heterosexual route was the most common route of transmission. Drug resistance-associated mutations were observed in 10% (4/40) of the study participants. The resistance mutation observed in the protease gene was V82A, whereas in the RT gene, M41L, D67N, M184V, and A98G were documented. This is the first study reporting major protease mutations by genotyping in ART-naive individuals from western India."
2003,0.005,1.0000,"The ability of HIV-1 to evolve resistance to antiretroviral drugs leads to treatment failure. By nucleotide sequencing of HIV-1 subtype B isolates, amino acids responsible for drug resistance have been identified. Less information is available, however, on the extent and distribution of these amino acids in HIV-1 nonsubtype B viruses circulating mainly in developing countries. More HIV-infected patients in the developing world are now using antiretroviral drugs, and hence there is a need to monitor drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 non-subtype B viruses. This study examines the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in 28 antiretroviral drug-naive HIV-1-infected Zambians. HIV-1 proviral DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The region encompassing gag p17 to env C2-V3-C3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing. Sequence analyses for drug resistance-associated mutations in th e protease and reverse transcriptase genes, and HIV-1 subtyping, were done. Overall, 92.8% of the generated sequences were HIV-1 subtype C. The generated sequences revealed only secondary associated, but no primary, drug-resistance mutations The most frequent secondary mutations in the protease and RT genes were, respectively, I93L(91.7%), L89M (79.2%), M3611V (79%, 4.2%), and R211K (70.8%), S48T (62.5%). The atypical residues M41N (3.6%) and D67A (3.6%) were detected in the RT gene. This study reveals many naturally occurring polymorphisms in HIV-1 subtype C isolates from antiretroviral drug-naive individuals. Such polymorphisms could lead to rapid treatment failure and development of drug-resistant HIV-1 mutants in individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy."
3507,0.005,1.0000,"The number of people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) reached to almost 40¬†million, half of which are under antiretroviral treatment (ART). Although the introduction of this therapy significantly improved the life span and quality of PLWHA, metabolic complications of these people remains to be an important issue. These metabolic complications include hyperlipidemia, abnormal fat redistribution and diabetes mellitus, which are defined as lipodystrophy syndrome. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a neuropeptide secreted from intestinal L cells and recently developed GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) stimulate insulin secretion, improve weight control and reduce cardiovascular outcomes. This class of drugs may be a valuable medication in the treatment of HIV-associated metabolic adverse effects and extend the life expectancy of patients infected with HIV. "
5487,0.005,1.0000,"Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) receive numerous medications from multiple providers. As a result, it is important that medication usage is properly documented in each patient's medical record. Lack of adequate documentation may confound a provider's assessment of drug efficacy, potentially leading to an increased incidence of drug interactions and adverse effects. The objective of this study was to determine if discrepancies exist between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record by healthcare providers. Data were obtained using structured telephone surveys and medical chart review. Study participants were recruited from the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center AIDS Clinic. Results obtained for 41 patients demonstrated discrepancies between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record ranging from 9 to 92 percent, depending on the class of drug. The largest differences were observed with the ""as-needed"" class of drugs: benzodiazepines (92 percent), morphine (60 percent), and codeine (56 percent). Differences were also noted for scheduled medications: ketoconazole (54 percent), clotrimazole (45 percent), acyclovir (38 percent), zidovudine (15 percent), and pentamidine (9 percent). These observed discrepancies reaffirm the need for accurate exchange of information between provider and patient to promote the most effective, rational, and safe drug therapy. Careful reviews of medication usage at each visit and use of pharmacy-based medication profiles are potential mechanisms to improve documentation of medication usage in HIV-infected patients."
4002,0.005,1.0000,"Despite widely available and effective treatments, there are racial/ethnic disparities in HIV-related mortality rates. The reason for inadequate HIV/AIDS management among minority populations is not fully understood, however recent research indicates that patients rate the quality of their health care higher if they are racially/ethnically concordant with their providers. As trust plays prominently on health care ratings, we examined whether racial/ethnicity concordance was associated with two dimensions of trust, trust in the provider and mistrust in the health care system, in 380 HIV infected people New York City. In this sample, concordance was associated with lower mistrust in the health care system, but not with trust in provider. We conclude that in this patient population and within the health care system available to them, racial/ethnic concordance might be more important for helping patients to understand and navigate the health care system rather than in interpersonal relationships with a single provider."
3911,0.005,1.0000,"The simultaneous presence of multiple HIV-1 subtypes has become common in communities with the growth of the pandemic. As a consequence, the potentiality for an increased frequency of HIV-1 mixed infections caused by viruses of distinct subtypes could be expected. Thus, there is a need to estimate the prevalence and geographic distribution of infections caused by viruses of a singular subtype as well as coinfections caused by two or more HIV-1 strains of distinct subtypes. To address this need, we have developed a genetic method based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to screen for these two types of infections within infected populations. In this assay, restriction enzymes may be used to predict the phylogroup of HIV-1 infected samples. A 297 bp pol fragment spanning the entire viral protease gene and a 311 bp fragment of the p24 gag region are used for this analysis. The viral regions are amplified by nested PCR using DNA templates from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or virus culture. Classification of HIV-1 strains to well defined subtypes B, D, F, and A/C is done by sequential endonuclease restriction analysis of a PCR amplified-protease gene followed by analysis of the p24 gag region. The electrophoretic migration patterns visualized by ethidium bromide staining or by radiolabeled probes are then determined on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. In infections caused by viruses of a singular subtype, a single restriction pattern is detected, whereas in multiple infections caused by two or more viral strains of different subtypes, the combination of different digestion patterns are observed in infected individuals. Using this methodology we have screened for genetic variations in HIV-1 proviral DNA from thirty-three Brazilian samples. Our RFLP procedure classified thirty-two samples as single infections caused by viruses of subtypes B (31) and F (1), and one sample as dual infection caused by distinct viral strains. Subsequent sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the viral protease gene in lymphocytes of all these patients confirmed our RFLP findings in single infections, and demonstrated the existence of two distinct HIV-1 strains of subtypes F and D in a patient which lymphocytes showed the simultaneous presence of two different digestion patterns. As up to now, single infections caused by subtype D variants were not identified in Brazil, our data provide the first evidence of subtype D HIV-1 in this country. Because sequencing of HIV proviral DNA is not particularly practical for large-scale molecular epidemiological studies, the protease/gag-based RFLP screening method will be useful to predict the phylogroup of HIV-1, and to identify multiple infections caused by HIV-1 strains of distinct subtypes. We believe that this information is crucial for both evaluation of the HIV-1/AIDS pandemic and intervention strategies."
2217,0.005,1.0000,"A variety of HIV-induced lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) have been described, including HIV encephalitis, HIV leukoencephalopathy, axonal damage, and diffuse poliodystrophy with neuronal loss of variable severity resulting, at least partly, from an apoptotic process. However, no correlation could be established between these changes and HIV dementia (HIVD). From our study of HIV infected patients, it appeared that neuronal apoptosis is probably not related to a single cause. Microglial and glial activation, directly or indirectly related to HIV infection, plays a major role in neuronal apoptosis possibly through the mediation of oxidative stress. In our patients with full-blown AIDS, this mechanism predominated in the basal ganglia and correlated well with HIVD. Axonal damage, either secondary to microglial activation, or to systemic factors also contributes to neuronal apoptosis. Although massive neuronal loss may be responsible for HIVD in occasional cases, we conclude that neuronal apoptosis is a late event and does not represent the main pathological substrate of HIVD. The dementia more likely reflects a specific neuronal dysfunction resulting from the combined effects of several mechanisms, some of which may be reversible. Introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy dramatically improved patient survival, however, its impact on the incidence and course of HIVD remains debatable. In our series, the incidence of HIVE has dramatically decreased since the introduction of multitherapies, but a number of cases remain whose cognitive disorders persist, despite HAART. The poor CNS penetration of many antiretroviral agents is a possible explanation, but irreversible ""burnt out"" HIV-induced CNS changes may also be responsible."
619,0.005,1.0000,"The introduction of enfuvirtide (FUZEON) represents an important advance in the treatment of therapy-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection. However, parenteral self-administration, and the advanced disease and antiretroviral experience of patients currently most needing enfuvirtide introduce unique usage considerations. Enfuvirtide has been shown to provide clinically relevant improvements in CD4 cell counts and reductions in HIV viraemia across all subgroups of treatment-experienced patients studied, including those taking few or no other active drugs. However, optimal outcome results from initiation when the CD4 cell count is above 100 x 10(6) cells/l and viraemia below 1 x 10(5) copies/ml, as part of a newly constructed third or fourth antiretroviral regimen in combination with one or two other antiretrovirals to which the virus remains sensitive. Resistance testing should be used where available to guide background drug selection. Where insufficient options for an effective background exist, enfuvirtide should still be considered and treatment undertaken with the aim of achieving an immunological or clinical response, despite the unlikelihood of a sustained virological outcome. Similarly, where there is no viable alternative treatment, enfuvirtide should be continued following virological failure wherever ongoing immunological or clinical benefit is discerned. Injection site reactions (ISRs) are common on enfuvirtide and will affect almost all patients. ISRs are manageable and seldom activity- or treatment-limiting. Bacterial pneumonia and systemic hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported uncommonly. A structured series of patient visits with a healthcare professional provides an atmosphere of ongoing training and support that may prevent 'injection fatigue', maintain adherence and minimise the incidence of ISRs. An initial investment in establishing such procedures can be expected to yield significant returns in patient confidence and benefit on enfuvirtide."
1449,0.005,1.0000,"Pulmonary infections are a very common complication in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. These infections may be severe enough to initiate the admission of these patients to intensive care units (ICU). Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is the most frequent cause of ICU admission because of acute respiratory failure. Mortality of ICU-admitted patients with this infection has changed with time. Initial reports confirmed a high mortality (80% to 90%). After 1985, the mortality rate decreased (50%). Factors such as the use of corticosteroids, better patient care, and a better knowledge of the disease probably explain this change. In recent years (1990 to 1995), mortality has worsened again, perhaps, because ICU facilities were offered more liberally to patients failing aggressive conventional treatment, including adjuvant therapy with corticosteroids. However, for those patients able to be discharged, the prognosis is not worse than expected according to the stage of their human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection and immunologic status. Consequently, at least a limited period of ICU care and some respiratory support (either continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation) should be considered and offered to all HIV-1-infected patients with PCP and respiratory failure. Cytomegalovirus may be another cause of severe pulmonary infection in AIDS patients. This infection is difficult to diagnose; hence, it should be suspected when patients with PCP do not progress appropriately, or when no responsible pulmonary pathogen is found. When associated with PCP, mortality is very high. Disseminated tuberculosis is another potential cause of severe respiratory failure and respiratory secretions should be routinely examined for acid-fast bacilli in AIDS patients with pulmonary infiltrates. Finally, bacterial pneumonia (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) may also be the etiological agents of severe acute respiratory failure. Empiric antibacterial treatment to cover these microorganisms should be given when a bacterial agent is suspected."

A cohort study was performed among HIV-infected women who delivered in a single tertiary centre in Barcelona, Spain, from January 2006 to December 2011. Consecutive singleton pregnancies delivered beyond 22 weeks of pregnancy were included. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) was defined as a birth weight below the 10th customised centile for gestational age and IUGR babies were compared to non-IUGR newborns. Intrauterine Doppler findings were described among IUGR foetuses. Baseline characteristics, HIV infection data and perinatal outcome were compared between groups. The results were adjusted for potential confounders. A total of 156 singleton pregnancies were included. IUGR occurred in 23.4 % of cases (38/156). In two-thirds of the cases detected before birth, Doppler abnormalities compatible with placental insufficiency were observed. IUGR pregnancies presented a worse perinatal outcome, mainly due to a higher risk of iatrogenic preterm delivery [adjusted odds ratio 6.9, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.4-33.5]. IUGR foetuses also had a higher risk of emergent Caesarean section and neonatal intensive care unit admission. No cases of intrauterine foetal death occurred. A high rate of IUGR was observed among HIV pregnancies, and it was associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, mainly iatrogenic preterm and very preterm birth due to placental insufficiency. Our results support that ultrasound detection and follow-up of IUGR foetuses should be part of routine antenatal care in this high-risk population to improve antenatal management."

Multiple mechanisms, both specific and nonspecific to HIV, underlie a significant prevalence. Although best-practice diagnostic testing remains unclear, the risks associated with diabetes in the setting of HIV are well characterized, ranging from organ-specific damage to socioeconomic decline. As population-specific treatment data are limited, current guidelines serve as a basis for ongoing management. "

Current - but not past - substance abuse adversely affects engagement in care, acceptance of antiretroviral therapy, adherence with therapy, and long-term persistence in care. Substance abuse treatment appears to facilitate engagement in HIV care, and access to evidence-based treatment for substance abuse is central to addressing the HIV epidemic. Strategies that show promise for HIV-infected substance abusers include integrated treatment models, directly observed therapy, and incentive-based interventions."
8118,0.005,1.0000,"Invasive pneumococcal disease (PD) occurs frequently among HIV-infected patients, but it is unclear whether its manifestations and outcome are different compared to those observed among patients without HIV-1 infection. Because the immune reconstitution that accompanies antiretroviral therapy may change some of these features and because most cases of HIV- 1 infection occur in resource-poor settings of the world where access to antiretroviral agents is limited, we compared PD among patients with and without HIV-1 infection in a North American population before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The records of all pneumococcal cultures processed at this medical center over a period of 20 months were used to identify patients with invasive PD. Hospital records were reviewed for 103 of these patients (52 with and 51 without HIV-1 infection) and demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and microbiologic information was abstracted and subsequently analyzed. Despite similarities in presenting signs and symptoms, we found a higher incidence of bacteremia but a more favorable outcome with less frequent requirements for intubation and admission to intensive care units and better survival among individuals with HIV infection. Factors such as less advanced age, the presence of fewer comorbid conditions, or a less florid inflammatory response among HIV-infected individuals may account for differences in outcome of invasive PD."

All HIV-positive mothers were placed on HAART for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. All exposed babies received single dose nevirapine within 72 h of birth and zidovudine syrup for 6 weeks. The babies were then tested for viral DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at 6 and 12 weeks of age.

It is unclear what constitutes well-being using a combined biomedical and psychosocial approach for patients with antiretroviral therapy (ART) access. This study aimed to determine the variance within the visual analogue scale (VAS) measure of health status using the existing five dimensions of the EuroQOL-5D, to identify which domains have the greatest effect on self-reported health status and to identify associations with the VAS using both biomedical and psychosocial factors among HIV outpatients. Consecutive patients in five UK clinics were recruited to a cross-sectional survey, n=778 (86% response rate). Patients self-completed validated measures, with treatment variables extracted from file. On the EuroQOL-5D, nearly one-third (28.1%) had mobility problems, one-fifth (18.7%) self-care problems, one-third (37.4%) difficulty in performing usual tasks and one-half (44.4%) reported pain/discomfort. In the regression model to determine associations with self-reported health status (VAS score), neither CD4 count nor ART status was associated with the outcome. However, in addition to four dimensions of the EuroQOL-5D, poorer health status was associated with worse physical symptom burden, treatment optimism and psychological symptoms. There is a relatively high prevalence of psychological morbidity and poor physical function, and these burdens of disease are associated with worse self-reported health status. As HIV management focuses on treatment for extended survival and a chronic model of disease, clinical attention to physical and psychological dimensions of patient care are essential to achieve optimal well-being."
7230,0.005,1.0000,"Like tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease is associated with poverty and social inequalities, conditions that hamper the delivery of care. Like tuberculosis, treatment of HIV infection requires multidrug regimens, and the causative agent acquires drug resistance, which can be transmitted to others. A pilot project in rural Haiti introduced DOT-HAART (directly observed therapy with highly active antiretroviral therapy) for the care of patients with advanced acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A similar DOT-HAART effort was launched in Boston for patients with drug-resistant HIV disease who had experienced failure of unsupervised therapy. In both settings, community health promoters or accompagnateurs provide more than DOT: they offer psychosocial support and link patients to clinical staff and available resources. DOT-HAART in these 2 settings presents both challenges and opportunities. These models of care can be applied to other poverty-stricken populations in resource-poor settings."
9443,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) policy for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has historically been based on clinical indications, such as opportunistic infections and CD4 cell counts. Studies suggest that CD4 counts early in HIV infection do not predict relevant public health outcomes such as disease progression, mortality, and HIV transmission in people living with HIV. CD4 counts also vary widely within individuals and among populations, leading to imprecise measurements and arbitrary ART initiation. To capture the clinical and preventive benefits of treatment, the global HIV response now focuses on increasing HIV diagnosis and ART coverage. CD4 counts for ART initiation were necessary when medications were expensive and had severe side effects, and when the impact of early ART initiation was unclear. However, current evidence suggests that although CD4 counts may still play a role in guiding clinical care to start prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, CD4 counts should cease to be required for ART initiation."

For the next 8‚ÄÖdays, he had intermittent fever up to 103¬∞F (39.4¬∞C) with relative bradycardia although he showed clinical improvement. There was no laboratory or imaging findings suggestive of another infectious source and drug fever was suspected. The antibiotics were stopped and after 48‚ÄÖhours no fever was observed until the day of discharge. Piperacillin/tazobactam can induce fever in patients with cystic fibrosis and in patients with other conditions. Drug fever may be more prevalent in patients with HIV infection. It has no characteristic pattern and may not be associated with eosinophilia. "
924,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) occurs both free and in association with IgG in the circulation of individuals infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). We determined free and IgG-bound HBeAg forms separately in the serum of humans and a chimpanzee acutely infected with HBV. In a patient with laboratory acquired HBV infection, the proportion of free HBeAg gradually decreased from 89% to 23%. A similar shift from free to IgG-bound form of HBeAg was invariably observed in 5 additional patients with acute Type B hepatitis. In a chimpanzee that had been experimentally inoculated with HBV, free HBeAg appeared first, then gradually and completely shifted to the IgG-bound form. Finally, IgG-bound HBeAg disappeared, and antibody to HBeAg was detectable in the serum. The determination of both free and IgG-bound forms of HBeAg may provide valuable information, because their ratio reflects the stage and prognosis of acute HBV infection."
3760,0.005,1.0000,"Liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease is complicated by HBV recurrence and, consequently, poor patient and graft survival. Patients transplanted for hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-related cirrhosis are reported to have a diminished incidence of HBV recurrence and improved graft survival. However, only a few reported HDV-infected patients had active HBV replicative disease before liver transplantation. In our experience, we transplanted two HDV-infected patients, both of whom had active HBV replication before liver transplantation. In one patient, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) recurred four months after transplantation. Two months later, Hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) and HBV-DNA became positive, and the patient died of fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. In the other patient, HBV persisted after transplantation, and 2 months later the patient required retransplantation for fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. With the second graft, the patient remained free of HBV infection for 1 year. Thereafter, the patient experienced HBV recurrence with active replication and died of fulminant hepatitis B and delta recurrence. In the first case and in the second graft of the second case, hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) immunoprophylaxis was administered in an attempt to prevent recurrence of HBV. The literature suggests that an HDV infection inhibits the replication of HBV and therefore plays a role in preventing the recurrence of HBV and improving survival. Our experience with two patients suggests that HDV infection, in the presence of active HBV replication, may not play a protective role."
2991,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-related stigma remains a persistent global health concern among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWA) in developing nations. The literature is lacking in studies about healthcare students' perceptions of PLWA. This study is the first effort to understand stigmatizing attitudes toward HIV-positive patients by healthcare students in Mwanza, Tanzania, not just those who will be directly treating patients but also those who will be indirectly involved through nonclinical roles, such as handling patient specimens and private health information. A total of 208 students were drawn from Clinical Medicine, Laboratory Sciences, Health Records and Information Management, and Community Health classes at the Tandabui Institute of Health Sciences and Technology for a voluntary survey that assessed stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. Students generally obtained high scores on the overall survey instrument, pointing to low stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA and an overall willingness to treat PLWA with the same standard of care as other patients. However, there are gaps in knowledge that exist among students, such as a comprehensive understanding of all routes of HIV infection. The study also suggests that students who interact with patients as part of their training are less likely to exhibit stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. A comprehensive course in HIV infection, one that includes classroom sessions focused on the epidemiology and routes of transmission as well as clinical opportunities to directly interact with PLWA-perhaps through teaching sessions led by PLWA-may allow for significant reductions in stigma toward such patients and improve clinical outcomes for PLWA around the world."
2,0.005,1.0000,"Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), a proteinase which activates plasminogen by cleaving at -CPGR(arrow downward)V-, was shown to cleave the V3 loop in recombinant gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IIIB and MN strains, as well as a synthetic, cyclized peptide representing the clade B consensus sequence of V3. Proteolysis occurred at the homologous -GPGR(arrow downward)A-, an important neutralizing determinant of HIV-1. It required soluble CD4 and was prevented by inhibitors of uPA but not by inhibitors of likely contaminating plasma proteinases. It was accelerated by heparin, a known cofactor for plasminogen activation. In immune capture experiments, tight binding of uPA to viral particles, which did not depend on CD4, was also demonstrated. Active site-directed inhibitors or uPA diminished this binding, as did a neutralizing antibody to V3. Addition of exogenous uPA to the laboratory-adapted IIIB strain of HIV-1, the macrophage-tropic field strains JR-CSF and SF-162, or a fresh patient isolate of indeterminate tropism, followed by infection of macrophages with the various treated viruses, resulted in severalfold increases in subsequent viral replication, as judged by yields of reverse transcriptase activity and p24 antigen, as well as incorporation, as judged by PCR in situ. These responses were reversible by inhibitors or antibodies targeting the proteinase active site or the V3 loop. We propose that uPA, a transcriptionally regulated proteinase which is upregulated when macrophages are HIV infected, can be bound and utilized by the virus to aid in fusion and may be an endogenous component that is critical to the infection of macrophages by HIV-1."

The findings in these patients were compared to a control group of 30 individuals who were immune to the HBV (anti-HBs antibody positive), but required hepatic replacement for other reasons. Eight of the forty-five (18%) HBsAg-positive patients have no serologic evidence of HBV reinfection after transplantation. All 37 remaining patients are reinfected; 21 (47%) developed chronic active hepatitis and/or cirrhosis, 3 (7%) developed submassive necrosis, and 6 (14%) developed chronic lobular hepatitis. One patient lost her graft to chronic rejection, despite reinfection with the B virus. Four other patients (9%) developed a chronic carrier state. No long-term follow-up biopsies were available in the remaining two patients. The histologic features associated with dysfunction related to recurrent HBV infection evolved from an acute to chronic phase and were similar to hepatitis B seen in nonallografted livers. Furthermore HBV-related lesions could be separated from rejection using routine histology alone. The only exception to this conclusion was the occurrence of a peculiar HBV-related lesion in two recipients, described herein. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of viral antigens in almost all cases. Hepatic inflammation also was commonly present during HBV disease and consisted mostly of accessory cells and T lymphocytes. Analysis of the effect of major histocompatibility complex matching revealed no clear association between the number of class I or II matches or mismatches and the development, or pattern, of active hepatitis in the allograft. Peculiar pathologic alterations in several of the biopsies and failed allografts after HBV reinfection suggests that, under special circumstances, the B virus may be cytopathic."

There are conflicting data on the effect of HCV on the risk of HIV progression and CD4 response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Long-term prospective cohort studies are clearly required to resolve these issues. The optimal management of the co-infected patient is also unclear. For the co-infected patient, the optimal HAART regimen for best immune CD4 recovery and least adverse reactions remains unclear. Unfortunately, current HCV treatment is associated with significant side effects and a considerable proportion of HIV co-infected patients are poor candidates for HCV treatment. Better and more effective treatment for HCV (preferably not based on interferon) is urgently required for this group of patients. Patients with good CD4 cell count and with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 are likely to have a reasonable response to treatment."

With the recent advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), those infected with HIV are now living longer and dying from illnesses other than acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although studies prior to the HAART era suggested poor outcomes might occur with transplantation in those infected with HIV, more recent studies have demonstrated results comparable to those of recipients without HIV infection. A number of issues persist regarding ethics, patient selection, post-operative management, and drug interactions between antiretroviral and immunosuppression agents. In this review, kidney, liver, and heart transplantation in the HIV-positive population were analyzed using data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/ Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients."
2232,0.005,1.0000,"We report a case of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in a 32-year-old man infected with human immunodeficiency virus and Leishmania guyanensis. Three months after initiation of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), the patient had disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis and started anti-leishmanial therapy. The patient's leishmaniasis manifestations during HAART ranged form an anergic response (46 CD4+ T cells/microL) to a disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis (112 CD4+ T cells/microL). Eight weeks later (168 CD4+ T cells/microL, skin biopsy specimens showed inflammatory infiltrates with no detectable amastigotes. The patient then became comatose. Prednisone therapy (60 mg/day) was initiated with a significant improvement within 48 hours. Three months later (CD4+ T cell count = 184 cell/microL), localized, classic, cutaneous leishmaniasis developed in the patient and anti-leishmanial treatment was re-introduced. On that occasion, frequency of T regulatory cells was 1.82% of all CD4+ cells. Our data suggest a pivotal role for CD4+ T cells in the onset of IRIS and lesion ulceration and their association with a low frequency of T regulatory cells."
5273,0.005,1.0000,"An 18 year-old heterosexual man was hospitalized because of fever, chills, a sore throat, and a dry cough for 8 days. He had had sexual intercourse with a new partner within the 4 months prior to admission. At admission, the patient presented a clinical picture compatible with hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). The presence of hemophagocytosis was subsequently determined pathologically from bone marrow and lymph node specimens. An exhaustive diagnostic work-up failed to reveal any causative etiology, the symptoms improving after 2 doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, given at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg each, the 2 doses being administered 1 week apart. Three months subsequent to the patient's initial presentation, acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was diagnosed, and the patient received highly active antiretrovirus therapy (HAART) from the time of diagnosis. The patient remained well for the following 2 years. HPS in the advanced stages of HIV infection has previously been described, but HPS during seroconversion of an acute form of the infection is rare. We most definitely suggest, however, that acute HIV infection be included in the list of potential causes of HPS. IVIG therapy appears to be an appropriate therapeutic modality, and HAART also is effective, for prevention of recurrence of HPS in a patient with acute HIV infection."
7321,0.005,1.0000,"Incidence of brain infections in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive patients is reduced after the availability of current high active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2) is an infrequent cause of encephalitis in HIV patients despite it is frequently involved in sexual transmitted infections. Here, we report a case of HSV-2 encephalitis occurring in a patient without full suppression of HIV replication within the brain. A 38 year-old HIV infected man was admitted to our department because of recurrent generalized seizure and fever during the previous 24 hours. Eight months before our observation the patient was switched from a protease inhibitor based regimen to a rilpivirine-based regimen without any evidence of HIV-RNA replication in the plasma. When the patient was admitted in our hospital, he was febrile and moderately confused, no deficit of cranial nerves was reported, motility was conserved, but he was unable to walk. Laboratory examinations performed at admission demonstrated an increase of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein and cells with lymphocyte prevalence, and normal CSF glucose. HSV-2-DNA and HIV-RNA were present within CSF at admission. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance imaging of the brain revealed lesions of the medial part of both temporal lobes including hippocampus without any sign of bleeding. A 21-day course of acyclovir therapy was administered with consistent improvement of clinical findings and disappearance of HSV-2-DNA within CSF. After the episode, HAART was switched to a regimen with high CSF penetrability containing abacavir, lamivudine, darunavir and ritonavir. Twelve months after HSV-2 encephalitis neurologic evaluation was normal, but symptoms of depression were reported, HIV-RNA remained undetectable both in the plasma and CSF, and CD4+ lymphocytes were above 500/ŒºL. No opportunistic infection was reported. Patients switched to regimen well tolerated such those containing rilpivirine, that have poor drug concentration within CSF could be considered at risk for opportunistic infection of the brain. Further larger investigation needs to confirm this finding. "
5159,0.005,1.0000,"Although the clinical benefits of antiviral treatment in the management of membranous nephropathy (MN) in patients with chronic hepatitis¬†B virus (HBV) infection have been suggested, it should be evaluated more carefully. In this report, we present two cases with quiescent HBV who were administered lamivudine for either the initial treatment of MN or to control the reactivation of HBV during treatment with corticosteroids. No clinical benefit of lamivudine as an initial treatment was observed in one patient, which obliged us to commence administration of prednisolone (PSL). On the other hand, lamivudine seemed to play a pivotal role in the remission of an acute exacerbation of hepatitis¬†B during treatment with PSL and mizoribine in the other patient. These two patients seemed to tolerate administration of PSL with or without an immunosuppressive agent well, since gradual and prompt improvements of nephrotic status were confirmed within a few months, thus suggesting the potential benefit of steroid treatment. There is little consensus regarding the optimal choice of steroids and immunosuppressants for the treatment of MN with chronic HBV infection, due to the potential for stimulation of viral replication and precipitation of hepatic flares. Our observations, however, suggest that treatment with PSL still should be reserved for quiescent HBV carriers with MN. Further studies will be required to determine the optimal timing and appropriate duration of antiviral treatment in such patients requiring long-term immunosuppression."

Both HIV clade C (HIV-C) and HIV clade B (HIV-B) can cause cognitive impairment, but it is unclear if these clades are characterized by similar patterns of brain dysfunction. We examined brain volumetrics and neuropsychological performance among highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-na√Øve HIV-B and HIV-C participants. Thirty-four HAART-na√Øve HIV-infected (HIV+) participants [17 HIV-B (USA); 17 HIV-C (South Africa)] and 34 age- and education-matched HIV-uninfected (HIV‚àí) participants were evaluated. All participants underwent similar laboratory, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging studies. Brain volume measures were assessed within the caudate, putamen, amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus, corpus callosum, and cortical (gray and white matter) structures. A linear model that included HIV status, region, and their interaction assessed the effects of the virus on brain volumetrics. HIV‚àí and HIV+ individuals were similar in age. On laboratory examination, HIV-C participants had lower CD4 cell counts and higher plasma HIV viral loads than HIV-B individuals. In general, HIV+ participants performed significantly worse on neuropsychological measures of processing speed and memory and had significantly smaller relative volumetrics within the thalamus, hippocampus, corpus callosum, and cortical gray and white matter compared to the respective HIV‚àí controls. Both HIV-B and HIV-C are associated with similar volumetric declines when compared to matched HIV‚àí controls. HIV-B and HIV-C were associated with significant reductions in brain volumetrics and poorer neuropsychological performance; however, no specific effect of HIV clade subtype was evident. These findings suggest that HIV-B and HIV-C both detrimentally affect brain integrity."
1439,0.005,1.0000,"Pulmonary infections and dysfunction are frequent outcomes during the development of immunodeficiency associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, and obtaining a better understanding of the immunologic changes that occur in lungs following HIV-1 infection will provide a foundation for the development of further intervention strategies. We sought here to identify changes in the pulmonary immune environment that arise during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques, which serves as an excellent model system for HIV-1 infection and disease. To examine the gene expression profiles of macaque lung tissues following infection with the pathogenic SIV/DeltaB670 isolate, we performed cDNA microarray hybridizations with lung total RNAs using two commercially available cDNA arrays and a custom-fabricated, immunologically focused macaque cDNA microarray. In situ hybridization and real-time RT-PCR were performed to provide additional analyses of gene expression. Among the genes exhibiting the highest level of induction in lung tissues were the IFN-gamma-inducible chemokines, CXCL10/IP-10 and CXCL9/Mig. In situ hybridization and real-time RT-PCR strongly supported these findings. Correlation analyses revealed that the levels of expression of IFN-gamma, CXCL9/Mig, and CXCL10/IP-10 mRNAs were all strongly positively correlated, and that CXCL10/IP-10 mRNA and Pneumocystis carinii rRNA were positively correlated. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that inflammatory chemokines are among the most differentially expressed mRNAs in macaque lung tissues during systemic SIV infection of rhesus macaques, and provide insight into the complicated events occurring in the lung tissues during HIV-1 infection in humans."
6138,0.005,1.0000,"The rate at which immunodeficiency develops in untreated human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1)-infected persons might be increasing or decreasing over time because of viral evolution or other factors. Beginning in 1984, Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study investigators recruited HIV-1-seronegative homosexual/bisexual men from four US metropolitan areas and examined them semiannually for HIV-1 seroconversion. To assess possible secular changes in the natural history of HIV-1 infection, the authors examined CD4+ lymphocyte data from 354 men who seroconverted between 1984 and 1991. To control for measurement differences among centers and over time, the authors adjusted CD4+ lymphocyte values to those of persistently seronegative participants. CD4+ lymphocyte percentage measurements at the first seropositive visit formed a U-shaped pattern, with the lowest values observed in 1988 and 1989. The authors observed no consistent secular pattern of CD4+ percentages at later visit dates, except that mean CD4+ percentages were consistently lowest in men who seroconverted in 1988. In a proportional hazards model, the time to the adjusted CD4+ lymphocyte count of < 500 cells/mm3 was not associated with the secular time of seroconversion (relative hazard = 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.97-1.13). The authors' data do not suggest a major change in the natural history of HIV-1 infection of this population."
20,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the success of combined antiretroviral therapy in controlling viral replication in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, commonly referred to as neuroAIDS, remain a frequent and poorly understood complication. Infection of CD8(+) lymphocyte-depleted rhesus macaques with the SIVmac251 viral swarm is a well-established rapid disease model of neuroAIDS that has provided critical insight into HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder onset and progression. However, no studies so far have characterized in depth the relationship between intra-host viral evolution and pathogenesis in this model. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) env gp120 sequences were obtained from six infected animals. Sequences were sampled longitudinally from several lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, including individual lobes within the brain at necropsy, for four macaques; two animals were sacrificed at 21 days post-infection (p.i.) to evaluate early viral seeding of the brain. Bayesian phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses of the sequence data were used to ascertain viral population dynamics and gene flow between peripheral and brain tissues, respectively. A steady increase in viral effective population size, with a peak occurring at ~50-80 days p.i., was observed across all longitudinally monitored macaques. Phylogeographic analysis indicated continual viral seeding of the brain from several peripheral tissues throughout infection, with the last migration event before terminal illness occurring in all macaques from cells within the bone marrow. The results strongly supported the role of infected bone marrow cells in HIV/SIV neuropathogenesis. In addition, our work demonstrated the applicability of Bayesian phylogeography to intra-host studies in order to assess the interplay between viral evolution and pathogenesis. "

The average length of follow-up was 2.1 years among 1,110 children. Among the 924 susceptible children who were followed up, 10.6% had seroconversions for HBV markers, none of which was associated with clinical illness; the annual incidence of HBV infections was 5.0%. Among the 98 children who experienced HBV infections during the study, 23% became HBsAg carriers, and HBsAg persistence was age-related, with most carriers being among the youngest children infected. In contrast, among the children with HBV markers at the time of enrollment, 118 (49.2%) were HBsAg-positive and 86% were still positive on follow-up. The incidence of HBV infections was significantly associated with the frequency of previous injections."

Generalised seizures were seen in 84%, partial with secondary generalisation in 10% and partial in 6%. Associated conditions included cerebral toxoplasmosis (22%), cryptococcal meningitis (8%), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (6%), cytomegalovirus encephalitis (6%), central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (2%), and other causes (14%) including pre-HIV epilepsy. No associated condition was identified in 42% of patients of whom 18% were receiving foscarnet therapy at the time of seizure, compared with 4% of control patients (p < 0.001). Concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid √¢2-microglobulin and neopterin, markers that have been associated with HIV-1 involvement of the CNS, were elevated in 12/12 and 13/13 patients, respectively, of the group with no identifiable cause for their seizure. We conclude that seizures occur principally in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, with opportunistic infections of the CNS the predominant underlying condition. In the group with no identifiable cause foscarnet therapy and subclinical HIV-1 involvement of the CNS may be factors responsible for seizure activity."
2533,0.005,1.0000,"R7V is a seven-aminoacid peptide epitope derived from cellular beta-2 microglobulin, present on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virion surface in patients with HIV infection. Antibodies against R7V peptide have the property of neutralizing all strains of HIV, unrelated to genotype, phenotype, or geographical origin of the virus, even in the presence of anti-retroviral drug resistance. Patients that mount an anti-R7V antibody response have been shown to be slow or non-progressors and this epitope has been considered for vaccine and/or therapeutic uses. In this study, HIV-infected patients under highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, were evaluated for the presence of anti-R7V antibodies. Thirty-three HIV positive patients and 10 healthy controls were enrolled to the study. For HIV-infected patients, determination of viral load and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts were performed by a commercial real-time PCR assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Anti-R7V antibodies were detected from serum samples by a commercial ELISA (Anti-R7V ELISA, Ivagen, France) test. Three HIV infected patients (3/33, 9.1%) displayed anti-R7V antibodies whereas the remaining 30 (90.9%) patients and all controls were interpreted as negative. No statistically significant difference was detected for HIV-RNA levels and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts between anti-R7V positive and negative patients (p= 0.871 and p= 0.287, respectively). These results indicate the presence of anti-R7V antibodies in our study population with HIV infection. No correlation with the presence of anti-R7V and disease progression were displayed in this study. Clinical impact of anti-R7V antibody assays for the management of HIV-infected patients will be revealed in the near future with the help of advanced studies."
3089,0.005,1.0000,"B cell subpopulations, as defined by double-labelling techniques with CD5 and CD19 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), were serially studied in 335 HIV-1 seropositive patients. At the time of the first consultation, no important modifications in either CD5+ or CD5- subpopulations were observed, whatever the stage of the disease. However, in 18 out of the 335 patients (5.37%), a sharp increase in B cells exceeding 20% and 300/mm3 was observed. This increase in B cells was mainly accounted for CD5-CD19+ B cell subpopulations and was associated with: (i) evolution of the disease, since only four patients presented it at their first consultation (one lymphadenopathy-associated syndrome (LAS) and three AIDS); (ii) advanced stages of disease since, at the time of B cell augmentation, two patients were staged as LAS, four as ARC and 12 as AIDS; (iii) a high incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) since three out of the 18 patients presented a histologically confirmed NHL and three others a clinical pattern compatible with this diagnosis. However, in three patients with B hyperlymphocytosis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement revealed the existence of a polyclonal expansion of B cells. These results justify inclusion of a pan-B cell marker in routine phenotypic studies of HIV-infected individuals, as well as the search for NHL among patients presenting this abnormality."

We developed an internally controlled quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to measure HIV-2 viral load and determined levels of plasma virus in a cohort of registered commercial sex workers in Dakar, Senegal. The assay has a lower limit of detection of 100 copies/mL and is linear over 4 logs. HIV-2 viral RNA was detectable in 56% of all samples tested; the median load was 141 copies/mL. Levels of viral RNA in the plasma were inversely related to CD4+ cell counts. HIV-2 and HIV-1 viral loads were compared among the seroincident women in the cohort; the median viral load was 30x lower in the HIV-2-infected women (P<.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test), irrespective of the length of time infected.

This study sought to identify independent risk factors involved in development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly in patients with chronic HBV infection who have normal ALT values. Data from 381 consecutive hepatitis B patients were analyzed with average ALT integration values < or = 40 IU/L and follow-up periods of > 3 years. Integration values were calculated from biochemical tests, and serological markers associated with the cumulative incidence of HCC were analyzed. HCC developed in 17 of the 381 patients (4.5%) during the follow-up period. Male sex (hazard ratio, 6.011 [95% confidence interval: 1.353-26.710], P = 0.018), high HBV-DNA levels (> or = 5.0 log copies/ml; 5.125 [1.880-13.973], P = 0.001), low platelet counts (< 15.0 x 10(4)/mm(3); 4.803 [1.690-13.647], P = 0.003), and low total cholesterol levels (< 130 mg/dl; 5.983 [1.558-22.979], P = 0.009) were significantly associated with greater incidence of HCC development. High HBV-DNA levels and low platelet counts are associated with the development of HCC in patients infected with hepatitis B who have normal ALT values. Therefore, maintenance of low HBV-DNA levels is important for the prevention of HCC in patients with low platelet counts, particularly in patients whose ALT values fall within the current normal range."

Multiple sites are frequently involved, and concomitant skin infection with the same organism is common, especially with Mycobacterium haemophilum. The incidence of atypical mycobacterial skeletal infection in HIV-infected individuals was significantly higher than in the general county hospital district patient population, whereas the frequency of Myobacterium tuberculosis skeletal infection did not differ significantly between the two populations. The clinician therefore should maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical mycobacteria in a patient presenting with skeletal infection in the setting of a markedly depressed CD4 count."
2784,0.005,1.0000,"By April 1995, 302 cases of vertically acquired HIV infection had been reported through the British Paediatric Association Surveillance Unit. Over 50% of these children had developed an AIDS indicator disease, including nine malignancies (seven cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and two of Kaposi's sarcoma). There were two other malignancies that were not AIDS indicator diseases. In children less than 5 years of age the incidence of NHL was approximately 2500 times greater than expected in the UK child population. Three children presented with NHL as their AIDS indicator disease and four developed NHL at a median of 14 (range 10-19) months after the initial diagnosis of AIDS. Six of the seven children died at a median of 6.5 (range 2-14) months after the diagnosis of NHL. The seventh child responded to treatment and is alive nearly four years later. Histology was available in five cases, of which four were of B cell and one of T cell origin. Epstein-Barr virus was detected in all three patients with NHL where it was sought; all had B cell lymphomas. Although comparatively rare, malignancies occur in children infected with HIV and may be the presenting illness. Paediatricians now need to consider HIV infection as a predisposing cause of childhood cancer, especially NHL."
6959,0.005,1.0000,"To determine if the early immunological and virological events of HIV infection are unique in a setting with limited access to health care and HIV-1 subtype C infection, we undertook a prospective cohort study to characterize the early natural history of HIV viral load and CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts in individuals with recent HIV seroconversion in India. CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts were prospectively measured for up to 720 days in 46 antiviral drug-naive persons with very early HIV infection, documented by HIV antibody seroconversion. HIV viral RNA levels were measured subsequently on reposited plasma samples from these same time points. The median viral load ""set point"" for Indian seroconverters was 28,729 RNA copies/ml. The median CD4(+) cell count following acute primary HIV infection was 644 cells/mm(3). Over the first 2 years since primary infection, the annual rate of increase in HIV viral load was +8274 RNA copies/ml/year and the annual decline in CD4 cell count was -120 cells/year. Although the viral ""set point"" was similar, the median trajectory of increasing viral load in Indian seroconverters was greater than what has been reported in untreated HIV seroconverters in the United States. These data suggest that the more rapid HIV disease progression described in resource-poor settings may be due to very early virological and host events following primary HIV infection. A rapid increase in viral load within the first 2 years after primary infection may have to be considered when applying treatment guidelines for antiretroviral therapy and opportunistic infection prophylaxis."
7906,0.005,1.0000,"Of 1,801 Chinese subjects, age 1 to 90 years, screened for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody (HBsAg, anti-HBs) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), 214 (11.9%) had an isolated, positive anti-HBc result; anti-HBc was reproducibly present in the initial sera in only 66% and persisted after an interval of 2 weeks to 3 months in only 73%. There was a strong correlation between the rates of reproducibility and persistence of isolated anti-HBc and the initial anti-HBc titers. Thirty-two subjects with persistent, isolated anti-HBc received four doses of hepatitis B vaccine (5 micrograms, HEVAC B) at 0, 1, 2 and 12 months: 56% developed a primary anti-HBs response in response to hepatitis B vaccine, 16% developed an anamnestic or secondary anti-HBs response, and 28% were undetectable for anti-HBs even after four doses of vaccine. The low rates of reproducibility and persistence of anti-HBc together with the high rate of primary anti-HBs response to hepatitis B vaccine in subjects with isolated anti-HBc raise doubts as to the reliability of anti-HBc (Corzyme, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill.) as a single screening test for hepatitis B infection prior to vaccination and suggests that subjects with isolated anti-HBc, in particular those with low anti-HBc titers, be included in vaccination programs."
4981,0.005,1.0000,"Previous studies characterized the third variable (V3) loop of the envelope gp120 as the principal neutralizing determinant for laboratory T-cell-line-adapted (TCLA) strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, primary viruses isolated from infected individuals are more refractory to neutralization than TCLA strains, suggesting that qualitatively different neutralizing antibodies may be involved. In this study, we investigated whether the V3 loop constitutes a linear target epitope for antibodies neutralizing primary isolates. By using peptides representative of the V3 regions of various primary isolates, an early, relatively specific and persistent antibody response was detected in sera from HIV-infected patients. To assess the relationship between these antibodies and neutralization, the same peptides were used in competition and depletion experiments. Addition of homologous V3 peptides led to a competitive inhibition in the neutralization of the TCLA strain HIVMN/MT-4 but had no effect on the neutralization of the autologous primary isolate. Similarly, the removal of antibodies that bind to linear V3 epitopes resulted in a loss of HIVMN/MT-4 neutralization, whereas no decrease in the autologous neutralization was measured. The different roles of V3-specific antibodies according to the virus considered were thereby brought to light. This confirmed the involvement of V3 antibodies in the neutralization of a TCLA strain but emphasized a more pronounced contribution of either conformational epitopes or epitopes outside the V3 loop as targets for antibodies neutralizing primary HIV-1 isolates. This result underlines the need to focus on new vaccinal immunogens with epitopes able to induce broadly reactive and efficient antibodies that neutralize a wide range of primary HIV-1 isolates."
9151,0.005,1.0000,"The neutralizing Ab response after primary HIV-1 infection is delayed relative to the virus-specific CD8(+) T cell response and the initial decline in plasma viremia. Because nearly all HIV-1 infections result in AIDS, it would be instructive to study cases where neutralizing Ab production commenced sooner. This was done in subject AC10, an individual treated during early infection and in whom a rapid autologous neutralizing Ab response was detected after therapy cessation as rebound viremia declined and remained below 1000 RNA copies/ml of blood for over 2.5 years. This subject's Abs were capable of reducing the infectivity of his rebound virus by >4 logs in vitro at a time when rebound viremia was down-regulated and virus-specific CD8(+) T cells were minimal, suggesting that neutralizing Abs played an important role in the early control of viremia. The rebound virus did not exhibit an unusual phenotype that might explain its high sensitivity to neutralization by autologous sera. Neutralization escape occurred within 75 days and was proceeded by neutralizing Ab production to the escape variant and subsequent escape. Notably, escape was not associated with a significant rise in plasma viremia, perhaps due to increasing CD8(+) T cell responses. Sequence analysis of gp160 revealed a growing number of mutations over time, suggesting ongoing viral evolution in the face of potent antiviral immune responses. We postulate that an early effective neutralizing Ab response can provide long-term clinical benefits despite neutralization escape."
1353,0.005,1.0000,"A 29-year-old Ghanaian woman who developed AIDS while being HIV-antibody seronegative was investigated during a collaborative study aimed at the identification of viral causes of a HIV-seronegative AIDS syndrome in West Africa. Plasma was screened with a panel of EIA tests for antibodies to HIV and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Retroviral infection was investigated by detection of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in plasma, viral RNA amplification and quantification, and virus isolation. Positive amplification products were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were carried out. Most EIA tests were unable to demonstrate the presence of anti-HIV anti-bodies, whereas confirmatory assays yielded inconclusive results. Retroviral infection was documented by detection of RT activity, HIV-1-specific genomic amplification and virus isolation. This virus was HIV-1 subtype A with an unusual six amino acid insertion in the gp120 V4 loop and with the nef gene of subtype G. The patient's plasma did not react with either autologous or heterologous viral lysates or HIV-1 peptides, whereas antibodies to other viral antigens were present. In conclusion, the Ghanaian patient exhibited a rare subtype A/G recombinant HIV-1 infection with a near absence of a HIV-specific humoral response. The lack of detectable antibody response might be due to either a highly pathogenic, rapidly fatal, HIV-1 infection preventing the development of the typical humoral immune response or to a host-related dysfunction of the immune system. Direct antigenemia or genomic detection of the virus should be undertaken when clinical or biological data suggests an HIV infection in the absence of serological evidence."
9613,0.005,1.0000,"Vertical transmission of Hepatitis B virus HBV can result in a state of chronic HBV infection and its complications. HBV vaccination with or without hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) prevents transmission of overt infection to the babies. However, whether it also prevents occult HBV infection in babies is not known. Consecutive pregnant women of any gestation found to be HBsAg positive were followed till delivery, and their babies were included in the study. Immediately after delivery, babies were randomized to receive either HBIG or placebo in addition to recombinant HBV vaccine (at 0, 6, 10 and 14 weeks). The primary end-point of the study, assessed at 18 weeks of age, was remaining free of any HBV infection (either overt or occult) plus the development of adequate immune response to vaccine. The babies were further followed up for a median of 2 years of age to determine their eventual outcome. Risk factors for HBV transmission and for poor immune response in babies were studied. Of the 283 eligible babies, 259 were included in the trial and randomized to receive either HBIG (n=128) or placebo (n=131) in addition to recombinant HBV vaccine. Of the 222 of 259 (86%) babies who completed 18 weeks of follow-up, only 62/222 (28%) reached primary end-point. Of the remaining, 6/222 (3%) developed overt HBV infection, 142/222 (64%) developed occult HBV infection, and 12/222 (5%) had no HBV infection but had poor immune response. All 6 overt infections occurred in the placebo group (P=0.030), while occult HBV infections were more common in the HBIG group (76/106 [72%] vs. 66/116 [57%]; P=0.025). This may be due to the immune pressure of HBIG. There was no significant difference between the two groups in frequency of babies developing poor immune response or those achieving primary end-point. The final outcome of these babies at 24 months of age was as follows: overt HBV infection 4%, occult HBV infection 42%, no HBV infection but poor immune response 8% and no HBV infection with good immune response 28%. Women who were anti-HBe positive were a low-risk group, and their babies were most likely to remain free of HBV infection (occult or overt) and had good immune response to the vaccine. Maternal HBeAg-positive status and negativity for anti-HBe predicted not only overt but also any infection (both overt and occult) in babies. In addition, high maternal HBV DNA and treatment with vaccine alone were significant factors for overt HBV infection in babies. The current practice of administration of vaccine with HBIG at birth to babies born of HBsAg-positive mothers is not effective in preventing occult HBV infection in babies, which may be up to 40%. Because the most important risk factors for mother-to-baby transmission of HBV infection are the replicative status and high HBV DNA level in mothers; it will be worthwhile investigating the role of antivirals and HBIG administration during pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HBV infection."
6859,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended in HIV-infected patients. Achieving seroprotection rates (anti-HBs ‚â• 10I U/L) comparable to the general population remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to analyze the proportion of responders among patients infected with HIV receiving primary HBV vaccination and identify factors associated with seroprotection rates. We analyzed the response to vaccination (antiHBs titers) in 474 HIV-infected patients receiving ‚â• 1 doses of vaccine between 1994 and 2009. Factors associated with response to vaccination were analyzed using a logistic regression model. Considering the first vaccine courses administered, a response rate of 60.3% (286/474) was obtained. Eighty-seven patients began a second course, responding in 58.6% of cases. Regardless of the number of doses, schedules, and whether or not they completed the course, the response rates were 71.1% (337/474). After adjustment for year of reception of the first dose, responders were less likely to have a higher baseline HIV 1-RNA viral load (OR: 0.78 95% CI: 0.68-0.91) and more likely to have a CD4 count ‚â• 350 cells/ŒºL (OR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.03-3.62). Patients receiving less than three doses of vaccine (OR: 0.31 95% CI 0.15-0.61) or three doses of the rapidly accelerated schedule (OR: 0.35 95% CI 0.15-0.81) had a lower probability of response in comparison with those receiving three doses of an accelerated schedule. In patients diagnosed with HIV, HBV vaccination before evolution to greater immunosuppression (CD4 < 350 cells/ŒºL) or delaying vaccination until the CD4 count is higher could provide better seroprotection rates. The rapidly accelerated vaccination schedule should be used with caution, due to its lower effectiveness. If seroprotection is not achieved after the first course, revaccination seems to be effective in increasing the proportion of responders."

8542,0.005,1.0000,"Hemodialysis patients are at an increased risk of acquiring hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, the prevalence of hepatitis viral infection and its genotype distribution among hemodialysis patients in Indonesia are unclear. In order to investigate these issues and the possibility of nosocomial transmission, 161 hemodialysis patients and 35 staff members at one of the hemodialysis unit in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, were tested for serological and virological markers of both viruses. HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected in 18 patients (11.2%) and in two staff members (5.7%). Anti-HCV was detected in 130 patients (80.7%) but not in any staff members. Occult HBV and HCV infection were detected in 21 (14.7%) and 4 (12.9%) patients, respectively. The overall prevalence rates of HBV and HCV infection among patients were 24.2% and 83.2%, respectively. HCV infection was independently associated with hemodialysis duration and the number of blood transfusions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 23 of 39 tested HBV strains (59%) were genotype B, 11 (28.2%) were genotype C, and 5 (12.8%) were genotype A. HCV genotype 1a was dominant (95%) among 100 tested HCV strains. Nosocomial transmission was suspected because the genotype distribution differed from that of the general population in Indonesia, and because the viral genomes of several strains were identical. These findings suggest that HBV and HCV infection is common among hemodialysis patients in Yogyakarta, and probably occurs through nosocomial infection. Implementation of strict infection-control programs is necessary in hemodialysis units in Indonesia."

To minimize the number of horizontal transmissions, we determined the prevalence of HBV genotypes among children in northern Thailand. From a survey of 1,231 schoolchildren in Chiang Mai during 1998 to 2000, 55 (4.5%) were found positive for HBsAg. Fifty-three HBsAg-positive samples were available for this study. These came from 28 girls (52.8%) and 25 boys (47.2%), age 5-16 years, with a mean age of 12.8 (+/-2.6) years. The laboratory method was based on a multiplex-PCR for the detection of 6 HBV genotypes (A-F). Among 53 HBsAg positive cases, 48 (90.6%) were genotype C, followed by 4 cases of genotype B (7.5%), and 1 case (1.9%) with mixed infection with genotypes B and C. The high prevalence of HBV genotype C follow by genotype B is similar to that found among blood donors in northern Thailand and the nationwide epidemiological survey conducted in 2004. Perinatal transmission may play an important role in the spread of the virus in this area, as in other Asian countries, where genotypes C and B are highly prevalent."

6006,0.005,1.0000,"Malaysia is a medium endemic country for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection but little is known about HBV strains circulating in Malaysian blood donors. Viral load, HBsAg concentrations and nested PCR products from 84 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) positive samples were analysed in detail. Median viral load was 3050 IU/mL and median HBsAg 1150 IU/mL. Fifty-six full genome, 20 pre-S/S, 1 S gene and six basic core promoter/precore-only sequences were obtained. Genotypes B and C were present at a ratio of 2:1, and two genotype D samples were obtained, both from donors of Indian background. Phylogenetically, genotype B was more diverse with subgenotypes B2-5, B7 and B8 present, while most genotype C strains were from subgenotype C1. Genotypes B and C were equally frequent in ethnic Malays, but 80% of strains from Chinese were genotype B. HBsAg concentrations were higher in genotype C than in genotype B, in Chinese than Malays and in donors under the age of 30. HBV vaccine escape substitutions (P120S/T, I126N and G145G) were present in six strains. In the large surface protein, immuno-inactive regions were more mutated than CD8 epitopes and the major hydrophilic region. Strains of genotype B or from ethnic Malays had higher genetic diversity than strains of genotype C or from Chinese donors. Hence HBV strains circulating in Malaysia are phylogenetically diverse reflecting the ethnic mix of its population. Ethnic Malays carry lower HBsAg levels and higher genetic diversity of the surface antigen, possibly resulting in more effective immune control of the infection."

Herein, we report the main clinical and virological features of cases reported in Spain. All individuals with HTLV-1 infection recorded at the national registry since 1989 were examined. Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the long terminal repeat (LTR) region. A total of 229 HTLV-1 cases had been reported up to December 2012. The mean age was 41 years old and 61% were female. Their country of origin was Latin America in 59%, Africa in 15%, and Spain in 20%. Transmission had occurred following sexual contact in 41%, parenteral exposure in 12%, and vertically in 9%. HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) was diagnosed in 27 cases and adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in 17 subjects. HTLV-1 subtype could be obtained for 45 patients; all but one belonged to the Cosmopolitan subtype a. One Nigerian pregnant woman harbored HTLV-1 subtype b. Within the Cosmopolitan subtype a, two individuals (from Bolivia and Peru, respectively) belonged to the Japanese subgroup B, another two (from Senegal and Mauritania) to the North African subgroup D, and 39 to the Transcontinental subgroup A. Of note, one divergent HTLV-1 strain from an Ethiopian branched off from all five known Cosmopolitan subtype 1a subgroups. Divergent HTLV-1 strains have been introduced and currently circulate in Spain. The relatively large proportion of symptomatic cases (19%) suggests that HTLV-1 infection is underdiagnosed in Spain."
3632,0.005,1.0000,"We studied the distribution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA in CCR5-positive and -negative peripheral blood lymphocyte populations in HIV-1-infected individuals. While HIV-1 DNA in the CCR5-positive population showed no correlation with CD4 count, the increase of total HIV-1 DNA with lower CD4 count was mainly contributed by the increase of HIV-1 DNA in the CCR5-negative population. This might indicate the change in coreceptor usage from CCR5 to CXCR4 in later stages of disease progression. However, some of the samples with a high viral DNA load in the CCR5-negative population did not have any characteristic of the V3 loop sequence that is compatible with CXCR4 usage or the syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype. We also did not find any known characteristic change predictive of the SI phenotype in V1 and V2 sequences. Our findings showed that there might be a shift in target cell populations during disease progression, and this shift was not necessarily associated with the genetic changes characteristic of CXCR4 usage."
5642,0.005,1.0000,"Immune activation is a major characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and a strong prognostic factor for HIV-1 disease progression. The underlying mechanisms leading to immune activation in viremic HIV-1 infection, however, are not fully understood. Here we show that, following the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the immediate decline of immune activation is closely associated with the reduction of HIV-1 viremia, which suggests a direct contribution of HIV-1 itself to immune activation. To propose a mechanism, we demonstrate that the single-stranded RNA of HIV-1 encodes multiple uridine-rich Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) ligands that induce strong MyD88-dependent plasmacytoid dendritic cell and monocyte activation, as well as accessory cell-dependent T-cell activation. HIV-1-encoded TLR ligands may, therefore, directly contribute to the immune activation observed during viremic HIV-1 infection. These data provide an initial rationale for inhibiting the TLR pathway to directly reduce the chronic immune activation induced by HIV-1 and the associated immune pathogenesis."

This increase can only be partly explained by a higher migratory flow and might reflect a delayed access to health facilities and to antiretroviral therapy in migrants. We performed a survey for the year 2003 of HIV-infected immigrants to Italy from countries outside the European Union to verify which factors might influence a lack of access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Italian centers of infectious diseases were requested to send sociodemographic and clinical data of HIV-infected immigrant patients. A total of 553 HIV-infected immigrants (49.9% women) were evaluated, representing 6.5% of all HIV-infected patients from these centers. The mean duration of residency in Italy was 6.6 +/- 5.0 years. The country of origin was Africa (64.5%), North and South America (24.2%), Eastern Europe (7.0%), and Asia (3.8%). A total of 407 of 553 patients (73.6%) were taking antiretroviral drugs at the time of screening. Females presented a younger age (p = 0.001), a lower frequency of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stage B/C (p = 0.008) and a more frequent heterosexual exposure to HIV (p < 0.001), while no differences were observed for time of first positive serology (p = 0.7). CD4 cell count (p = 0.9) and log plasma HIV-RNA (p = 0.1). Characteristics of HAART patients were compared to those of nontreated patients, despite a CD4 cell count less than 350 cells/mm(3).

313,0.005,1.0000,"CD4(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for the maintenance of the immune system's equilibrium, by dampening the activation of potential auto-reactive T cells and avoiding excessive immune activation. To correctly perform their function, Tregs must be maintained at the right proportion with respect to effector T cells. Since this equilibrium is frequently disrupted in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), we hypothesize that its deregulation could hamper immune reconstitution in patients with poor CD4(+) T cell recovery under highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We analysed Tregs percentages amongst CD4(+) T cells in 53 HIV-infected patients under HAART, with suppression of viral replication and distinct levels of immune reconstitution. As controls, 51 healthy individuals were also analysed. We observed that amongst the patients with Nadir values (the lowest CD4(+) T cell counts achieved) <200 cells/¬µL, the individuals with high Tregs percentages (‚â•10% of total CD4(+) T cells) had the worse CD4(+) T cell reconstitution. In accordance, the well-described direct correlation between the Nadir value and CD4(+) T cell reconstitution is clearly more evident in individuals with high Tregs proportions. Furthermore, we observed a strong negative correlation between Tregs percentages and CD4(+) T cell recovery among immunological non-responder HIV(+) individuals. All together, this work shows that high Tregs frequency is an important factor associated with sub-optimal CD4(+) T cell recovery. This is particularly relevant for immunological non-responders with low Nadir values. Our results suggest that the Tregs proportion might be of clinical relevance to define cut-offs for HAART initiation."

Forty-four hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated by TACE using epirubicin plus mitomycin C were studied. Serum HBV DNA (n=17) and HCV RNA (n=27) levels were measured 1 day before and 3 months after TACE. Plasma concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents were determined at 1 hour and 72 hours after TACE. A total of 29 patients (n=13 for chronic hepatitis Band n=16 for chronic hepatitis C) showed significant changes of the viral loads after TACE. Patients with increased viral loads after TACE were older (p=0.041), had higher incidence of pre-TACE white blood cell counts being less than normal limit (p=0.023), and had higher plasma mitomycin C concentrations (p=0.039) than those in patients with decreased viral loads. Analysis by multiple logistic regressions using age, decreased or normal pre-TACE white blood cell counts, mitomycin C concentrations >3.95 ng/mL adopted by receiver operating characteristic curve (p=0.037), and epirubicin concentrations have shown that decreased pre-TACE white blood cell counts was the only significant factor associated with increased viral loads after TACE (p=0.048). In conclusion, patients with decreased pre-TACE white blood cell counts have a potential risk for the reactivation of the replication of HBV or HCV after TACE."

Over a 1-year period, the HIV-related headache occurred in 2.8% of total admissions to the HIV service as opposed to 0.2% of admissions to the neurology service. The affected patients had advanced HIV infection (CD4+ cell count = 58.9 +/- 80.3; normal, > 500 x 10(-6)/l). The headache had features similar to those ascribed to HIV aseptic meningitis and was not related to the presence of AIDS dementia complex or its subsequent development over a 6-month follow-up. We propose that this is a distinct clinical entity related to HIV infection that is similar, if not identical, to HIV aseptic meningitis except for the lack of a CSF pleocytosis, probably reflecting the lymphocyte depletion that is characteristic of the more advanced state of HIV infection."
1801,0.005,1.0000,"Previous studies proposed a dynamic, steady-state relationship between HIV-mediated cell killing and T-cell proliferation, whereby highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) blocks viral replication and tips the balance toward CD4(+) cell repopulation. In this report, we have analyzed blood and lymph node tissues obtained concurrently from HIV-infected patients before and after initiation of HAART. Activated T cells were significantly more frequent in lymph node tissue compared with blood at both time points. Ten weeks after HAART, the absolute number of lymphocytes per excised lymph node decreased, whereas the number of lymphocytes in the blood tended to increase. The relative proportions of lymphoid subsets were not significantly changed in tissue or blood by HAART. The expression levels of mRNA for several proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha) were lower after HAART. After therapy, the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 -- adhesion molecules known to mediate lymphocyte sequestration in lymphoid tissue -- was also dramatically reduced. These data provide evidence suggesting that initial increases in blood CD4(+) cell counts on HAART are due to redistribution and that this redistribution is mediated by resolution of the immune activation that had sequestered T cells within lymphoid tissues."

As expected based on the structure of the drug, it bound competitively with another two-metal binding inhibitor (Kd [binding constant], 6 +/- 4 nM). In a number of different cellular assays, GSK364735 inhibited HIV replication with potency at nanomolar concentrations (e.g., in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and MT-4 cells, 50% effective concentrations were 1.2 +/- 0.4 and 5 +/- 1 nM, respectively), with selectivity indexes of antiviral activity versus in-assay cytotoxicity of at least 2,200. When human serum was added, the antiviral potency decreased (e.g., a 35-fold decrease in the presence of 100% human serum was calculated by extrapolation from the results of the MT-4 cell assay). In cellular assays, GSK364735 blocked viral DNA integration, with a concomitant increase in two-long-terminal-repeat circles. As expected, this integrase inhibitor was equally active against wild-type viruses and mutant viruses resistant to approved drugs targeting either reverse transcriptase or protease. In contrast, some but not all viruses resistant to other integrase inhibitors were resistant to GSK364735. When virus was passaged in the presence of the inhibitor, we identified resistance mutations within the integrase active site that were the same as or similar to mutations arising in response to other two-metal binding inhibitors. Finally, either additive or synergistic effects were observed when GSK364735 was tested in combination with approved antiretrovirals (i.e., no antagonistic effects were seen). Thus, based on all the data, GSK364735 exerted potent antiviral activity through the inhibition of viral DNA integration by interacting at the two-metal binding site within the catalytic center of HIV integrase."
2910,0.005,1.0000,"The antiviral effect of the CH(2)Cl(2)/MeOH-soluble fraction from the alga Dictyota menstrualis on HIV-1 replication was evaluated in vitro. The antiretroviral activity was attributed to two diterpenes: (6R)-6-hydroxydichotoma-3,14-diene-1,17-dial, named Da-1, and (6R)-6-acetoxi-dichotoma-3,14-diene-1,17-dial, named AcDa-1. Da-1 or AcDa-1 were added to the culture medium of HIV-1-infected PM-1 cells at different times post-infection or during virus adsorption/penetration. The results indicated that the compounds affected an early step of the virus replicative cycle. Virus binding and entry into the host cells were evaluated in the presence of each diterpene, but no inhibitory effect was observed. To evaluate provirus DNA synthesis/integration into the host genome, the viral protease coding sequence was amplified from total cellular DNA. Proviral DNA was not detected in infected cells incubated with the diterpenes. To investigate the effect of the diterpenes on the reverse transcription of the viral genomic RNA, the recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) was assayed in vitro in the presence of each diterpene. Da-1 and AcDa-1 inhibited the RNA-dependent DNA-polymerase activity of HIV-1 RT in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our results demonstrate that both diterpenes inhibit HIV-1 RT and consequently virus replication."
9579,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and human T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infections have complex effects on adaptive immunity, with specific tropism for, but contrasting effects on, CD4 T lymphocytes: depletion with HIV-1, proliferation with HTLV-1. Impaired T lymphocyte function occurs early in HIV-1 infection but opportunistic infections (OIs) rarely occur in the absence of CD4 lymphopenia. In the unusual case where a HIV-1 infected individual with a high CD4 count presents with recurrent OIs, a clinician is faced with the possibility of a second underlying comorbidity. We present a case of pseudo-adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfection where the individual fulfilled Shimoyama criteria for chronic ATLL and had pulmonary Mycobacterium kansasii, despite a high CD4 lymphocyte count. However, there was no evidence of clonal T-cell proliferation by T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies nor of monoclonal HTLV-1 integration by high-throughput sequencing. Mutually beneficial interplay between HIV-1 and HTLV-1, maintaining high level HIV-1 and HTLV-1 viremia and proliferation of poorly functional CD4 cells despite chronicity of infection is a postulated mechanism. Despite good microbiological response to antimycobacterial therapy, the patient remained systemically unwell with refractory anemia. Subsequent initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy led to paradoxical resolution of CD4 T lymphocytosis as well as HIV-1 viral suppression and decreased HTLV-1 proviral load. This is proposed to be the result of attenuation of immune activation post-HIV virological control. This case illustrates the importance of screening for HTLV-1 in HIV-1 patients with appropriate clinical presentation and epidemiological risk factors and explores mechanisms for the complex interactions on HIV-1/HTLV-1 adaptive immunity."
3763,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to assess the analytical and clinical relevance of minority variants using a new pyrosequencing (PSQ) assay and to detect minor variants with frequencies below the current 20% clinical setting limit. A PSQ approach for detecting and quantifying mutations was developed for the analysis of 14 codons of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) gene below the limit of conventional sequencing. Ten patients who experienced virological failure (VF) after a first-line regimen of lamivudine, tenofovir, and either efavirenz, nevirapine, or etravirine, as well as 10 controls patients without VF, were included in this retrospective study. Baseline plasma and plasma from the time of VF were assessed using Sanger sequencing and PSQ methods. The analytical sensitivity for the detection of minor sequence variants is 5%. At baseline, no minority variant was detected in 10/10 patient controls using both the Sanger sequencing and PSQ assays, whereas, two patients who failed therapy had baseline non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations that were not detected by the standard genotyping. At the time of VF, standard genotyping detected mutations in four out of the 10 VF patients, whereas, PSQ detected mutations in five out of the 10 VF patients. Clinically, minority mutations at a 10% level of detection can be assessed efficiently by pyrosequencing and used as a suitable predictor of the evolution of viral populations. These traits allow for a better interpretation of data analysis, which can help clinicians in providing a suitable treatment for HIV."
803,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp120 induces multiple cellular signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) pathway. The role of the PI3-kinase pathway in HIV-1 replication is not understood. Here we examined whether HIV-1 gp120 upregulates the PI3-kinase pathway and whether PI3-kinase activity plays a role in virus replication in primary human CD4(+) T cells and macrophages. Soluble and virion-associated HIV-1 gp120 induced calcium mobilization and phosphorylation of the PI3-kinase downstream effectors PKB/Akt and p70 S6 kinase. gp120-induced PI3-kinase activity and calcium mobilization were inhibited by pertussis toxin and blocking antibodies directed against CCR5 and CXCR4, suggesting that the signaling is mediated through the chemokine receptor. The PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 inhibited infection of CD4(+) T cells and macrophages with X4 and R5 HIV-1-pseudotyped viruses at concentrations that did not induce cell toxicity or downregulate HIV-1 coreceptor expression. When gp120-induced signaling was bypassed with the vesicular stomatitis virus G envelope protein, infection was still sensitive to PI3-kinase inhibition, suggesting that basal PI3-kinase activity is required for infection. LY294002 inhibited HIV-1 infection when added after viral entry and did not affect formation of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase products R/U5 and long terminal repeat/Gag in the presence of the inhibitor. However, when the inhibitor was added after viral integration had occurred, no inhibition of HIV infection was observed. Our studies show that inhibition of the PI3-kinase signaling pathway suppresses virus infection post-viral entry and post-reverse transcription but prior to HIV gene expression. This type of host-virus interaction has implications for anti-HIV therapeutics that target cellular signaling machinery."
2398,0.005,1.0000,"In the current study we investigated the prevalence of the TNF-Œ± 238G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the TNF-Œ± gene in the development of lipodystrophy among HIV-1 infected individuals who had been receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the immunodeficiency clinics of the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) at Pune, India. We assessed the association of this SNP with the development of lipoatrophy/dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in these patients and measured carotid intima thickening which is a surrogate marker for chronic cardiac morbidity. Our results show that the incidence of the TNF-Œ± 238G/A SNP is ~ two fold higher in patients with lipodystrophy as compared to those without lipodystrophy. Patients with lipodystrophy demonstrated a higher likelihood of the development of metabolic syndrome as evident by increased insulin sensitivity and increased percentage (%) Œ≤ cell function. Further, a significant increase in left carotid intima thickness was observed in patients with lipodystrophy. Our study validates the association of the TNF-Œ± 238G/A SNP allelic variant with the development of HIV- lipodystrophy via the modulation of TNF-Œ± production, which contributes to dyslipidemia, increased lipolysis, increased insulin resistance, altered differentiation of adipocytes and increased carotid intima thickness. The contribution of genetic determinants such as the TNF-Œ± 238G/A SNP to lipodystrophy, may provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie this disease condition and may be useful in the future for personalized therapy. Additionally, these findings will be useful in monitoring chronic cardiac morbidities among HIV infected individuals who express this SNP. "

2514,0.005,1.0000,"Previous studies have highlighted disparities in care and outcomes in HIV-positive prisoners compared to HIV-positive individuals in the population. We audited clinical outcomes of HIV-positive prisoners accessing care in 2011. Public Health England were notified of 161 prisoners with HIV in the time period studied. Audit proformas were sent to clinics reporting prisoners to the genitourinary medicine clinic activity dataset in 2011. Thirty-two clinics responded. Data for 151 HIV-positive prisoners were reported by 12 clinics, with the other clinics not reporting any prisoners. Outcomes were compared to a previous audit, British HIV Association (BHIVA) and the National AIDS Trust guidelines. Initial CD4 counts were available for 101 patients, of which 42/101 had CD4 <350‚Äâcells/mm(3). At reception, viral load data were available for 95 patients, of which 74 were on antiretroviral therapy. Of these, 50/74 (68%) had VL <40 copies/ml. Fifty-one per cent of those on highly active antiretroviral therapy were seen in a specialist clinic less than four weeks after reception. Urgency of referral to a specialist HIV clinic was not related to CD4 or viral load. Twenty-two per cent had hepatitis C co-infection. Clinical outcomes have improved since the last audit but further opportunities exist to optimise care in prisons. "

This was a cross-sectional study. Two hundred twenty-seven HIV-infected patients were evaluated during a single outpatient visit to the General Clinical Research Center of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Usual dietary intake and physical activity habits were evaluated; the Mediterranean Diet Score (MedDietScore) was calculated. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, computed tomographic findings, anthropometrics, and data from the study interviews and questionnaires were used for the assessment of body composition using specific criteria. A complete metabolic profile was available for all subjects. In the entire study sample, a weak inverse association was found between insulin resistance, estimated using the homeostasis model assessment, and MedDietScore (standardized beta = -0.15, P = .03). Interaction models revealed that this was largely driven by an inverse association in patients with FR (standardized beta = -0.13, P = .02). Moreover, MedDietScore was positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (standardized beta = 0.15, P = .01) and marginally negatively associated with circulating triglyceride levels (standardized beta = -0.16, P = .13) in this group of patients. Adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern was favorably related to cardiovascular risk factors in HIV-positive patients with FR. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm our data in different populations and to explore the underlying mechanisms."
5025,0.005,1.0000,"Exenatide is an incretin mimetic indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, metformin, or metformin plus a sulfonylurea or thiazolidinedione. Exenatide lowers postprandial blood glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and increasing satiety. Therapy with exenatide often results in weight loss, which further assists in decreasing insulin resistance. This feature makes the drug an attractive therapeutic option for obese patients. We report the successful off-label use of exenatide in an obese, 40-year-old man with type 1 diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who had gastrointestinal intolerance to pramlintide. The patient had experienced a dramatic weight gain secondary to his antiretroviral drugs. This weight gain led to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes; thus he had characteristics of both types 1 and 2 diabetes, or double diabetes. Before the start of exenatide therapy, he weighed 123 kg, had a body mass index of 42.3 kg/m(2), and had a suboptimal hemoglobin A(1c) value of 8.7%. After 11 months of therapy, the patient lost 24 kg (19.5% of his body weight) and achieved a hemoglobin A(1c) value of 7.3%. His basal insulin requirement was reduced by 25%, and his use of short-acting insulin before breakfast and before dinner was discontinued. In addition, the patient's quality of life substantially improved, as he was able to return to work and exercise after being nearly incapacitated by his weight. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of the use of exenatide in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Given this experience, exenatide may prove to be a useful alternative in selected patients with type 1 diabetes."
4403,0.005,1.0000,"The successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a combination of potent antiretroviral agents, including protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, has impacted positively on morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. Over time, HAART has been associated with a number of metabolic and anthropometric abnormalities, including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance as well as subcutaneous fat loss and abdominal obesity, potentially contributing to cardiovascular risk. Recent studies have more firmly established that both HIV infection and HAART might increase the risk of clinical cardiovascular events. Furthermore, whereas HIV/HAART is associated with multiple aspects of endocrine dysfunction, there has been less focus on bone disease, although some studies indicate a higher prevalence of osteoporosis among HIV-positive subjects compared to HIV-negative controls. The relationship between bone and fat metabolism under HIV-positive conditions deserves further attention, and available data suggest the possibility of an intriguing connection. In the future, an increasing population of aging HIV-positive patients with a spectrum of antiretroviral therapies and accumulation of endocrine abnormalities and conventional cardiovascular risk factors will present preventive and therapeutic challenges to our health-care system."
9815,0.005,1.0000,"The major causative agent for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 is a predominant subtype of HIV which counts on human cellular mechanism virtually in every aspect of its life cycle. Binding of viral envelope glycoprotein-gp120 with human cell surface CD4 receptor triggers the early infection stage of HIV-1. This study focuses on the interaction interface between these two proteins that play a crucial role for viral infectivity. The CD4-gp120 interaction interface has been studied through a comprehensive protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) analysis and highlighted as a useful step towards identifying potential therapeutic drug targets against HIV-1 infection. We prioritized gp41, Nef and Tat proteins of HIV-1 as valuable drug targets at early stage of viral infection. Lack of crystal structure has made it difficult to understand the biological implication of these proteins during disease progression. Here, computational protein modeling techniques and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to generate three-dimensional models of these targets. Besides, molecular docking was initiated to determine the desirability of these target proteins for already available HIV-1 specific drugs which indicates the usefulness of these protein structures to identify an effective drug combination therapy against AIDS."

Among 1,910 Onchocerca volvulus carriers in a hyperendemic focus, 73 (3.8%) were concurrently infected with HIV and 20 (7.2%) of 276 persons without microfilariae (mf) were HIV-seropositive. A stratified analysis showed no epidemiologic association between onchocerciasis and HIV infection. Consistently, a microfilaria density of 11.9 mf/mg of skin in HIV-positive subjects and 17.7 mf/mg in HIV-negatives ones was observed. During mass treatment of onchocerciasis with a single dose of 150 micrograms/kg of ivermectin, no difference of the efficacy was detected between persons with or without HIV and side effects in the two groups were similar. Even in HIV-positive persons with a reduced ratio of CD4+:CD8+ cells and reduced numbers of CD4+ cells, a significant reduction of their microfilaria density was observed after treatment with ivermectin. Thus, in HIV-endemic areas, the usual dose of ivermectin can be administered during mass treatment."

Compared with the controls, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was reduced in all groups (P < 0.01). Plasma triglyceride was increased in patients taking protease inhibitors (P < 0.05). VLDL and IDL apoB fractional catabolic rate (FCR) was lower in all treatment groups (P < 0.05) compared with controls. Trunk fat, VLDL apoB absolute secretion rate, and insulin resistance were not different between groups. Peripheral fat was lower in the treated patients (P < 0.05) and correlated with duration of therapy (r = -0.55; P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between peripheral fat and VLDL apoB FCR (P = 0.002) and IDL apoB FCR (P = 0.002) and a negative correlation with VLDL apoB pool size, VLDL cholesterol, and triglyceride (P < 0.03; P < 0.01; P < 0.002). These results suggest that mild dyslipidemia resulting from antiretroviral therapy is caused by a decrease in VLDL and IDL apoB FCR, which is associated with a loss of peripheral fat."
2498,0.005,1.0000,"The spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has gradually decreased in Italy in the last 5 decades as shown by the steady reduction in the incidence rates of acute hepatitis B, from 10/100000 inhabitants in 1984 to 0.85/100000 in 2012, and by the reduced prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive cases among chronic hepatitis patients with different etiologies, from 60% in 1975 to about 10% in 2001. The prevalence of HBsAg chronic carriers in the general population also decreased from nearly 3% in the 1980s to 1% in 2010. Linked to HBV by its characteristics of defective virus, the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) has shown a similar epidemiological impact on the Italian population over time. The incidence of acute HDV infection decreased from 3.2/100000 inhabitants in 1987 to 0.8/100000 in 2010 and the prevalence of HDV infection in HBsAg chronic carriers decreased from 24% in 1990 to 8.5% in 2006. Before the beneficial effects of HBV mass vaccination introduced in 1991, the decreased endemicity of HBV and HDV infection in Italy paralleled the improvement in screening blood donations, the higher standard of living and impressive reduction in the birth rate associated with a marked reduction in the family size. A further contribution to the decline in HBV and HDV infections most probably came from the media campaigns to prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus infection by focusing the attention of the general population on the same routes of transmission of viral infections such as unsafe sexual intercourse and parenteral exposures of different kinds.

Using the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and Outpatient Registry, we identified 9160 patients with chronic HBV infection between 1997 and 2008, of whom 327 had chronic HDV infection and 323 had acute HDV infection. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for these patients compared with the general population. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was greatly increased in patients with HBV and HDV (SIR = 137.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 62.19 to 261.51). The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients with HBV and HDV was increased (SIR = 6.11, 95% CI = 2.77 to 11.65) when patients with chronic HBV infection alone were used as the reference population. Similar results were observed for patients with chronic HDV infection (SIR = 99.26, 95% CI = 42.39 to 196.55). Our findings indicate that HDV is a strong risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma."

Adult patients with Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive were evaluated for the presence of HDV using anti HDV-IgG and HDV RNA by RT-PCR. Routine laboratory investigations, genotypes and subtypes for both HBV and HDV, abdominal sonography, and transient elastography (TE) were done. Liver biopsy was performed only in whenever indicated. One hundred and twenty-one treatment-na√Øve chronic HBV patients were included. Wild HBV genotype-D2 was found in 98.2% and 81.9% were HBeAg negative. Prevalence of HDV was 8.3% by anti-HDV IgG and 9.9% by RT-PCR. Wild HDV genotype-IIb was reported in 83.3%. HDV infection was more common in males, 90.9% of delta patients were HBeAg negative. Compared to the mono-infected HBV, concomitant HBV/HDV infection was not associated with more derangment in ALT nor advanced stage of fibrosis. 66.7% of HDV patients had significantly lower HBV-DNA level compared to the non-delta patients (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). HDV is not uncommon in Egypt. HBV genotype-D was associated with HDV genotype-IIb.

In the mid-eighties, an outbreak of HDV fulminant hepatitis (FH) in the Central African Republic (CAR) killed 88% of patients hospitalized in Bangui. We evaluated infections with HBV and HDV among students and pregnant women, 25 years after the fulminant hepatitis (FH) outbreak to determine (i) the prevalence of HBV and HDV infection in this population, (ii) the clinical risk factors for HBV and/or HDV infections, and (iii) to characterize and compare the strains from the FH outbreak in the 1980s to the 2010 HBV-HDV strains. We performed a cross sectional study with historical comparison on FH-stored samples (n = 179) from 159 patients and dried blood-spots from volunteer students and pregnant women groups (n = 2172). We analyzed risk factors potentially associated with HBV and HDV. Previous HBV infection (presence of anti-HBc) occurred in 345/1290 students (26.7%) and 186/870 pregnant women (21.4%)(p = 0.005), including 110 students (8.8%) and 71 pregnant women (8.2%), who were also HBsAg-positive (p = 0.824). HDV infection occurred more frequently in pregnant women (n = 13; 18.8%) than students (n = 6; 5.4%) (p = 0.010). Infection in childhood was probably the main HBV risk factor. The risk factors for HDV infection were age (p = 0.040), transfusion (p = 0.039), and a tendency for tattooing (p = 0.055) and absence of condom use (p = 0.049). HBV-E and HDV-1 were highly prevalent during both the FH outbreak and the 2010 screening project. For historical samples, due to storage conditions and despite several attempts, we could only obtain partial HDV amplification representing 25% of the full-length genome. The HDV-1 mid-eighties FH-strains did not form a specific clade and were affiliated to two different HDV-1 African subgenotypes, one of which also includes the 2010 HDV-1 strains. In the Central African Republic, these findings indicate a high prevalence of previous and current HBV-E and HDV-1 infections both in the mid-eighties fulminant hepatitis outbreak and among asymptomatic young adults in 2010, and reinforce the need for universal HBV vaccination and the prevention of HDV transmission among HBsAg-positive patients through blood or sexual routes."

This study aimed to estimate incidence rates of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and its major subtypes in a nationwide cohort of parous women and to assess their associations with chronic HBV infection. We conducted a cohort study including 1,782,401 pregnant Taiwanese women whose HBV serostatus was obtained from the National Hepatitis B Vaccination Registry. Newly diagnosed ICCs and NHLs were ascertained through data linkage with the National Cancer Registry. Risks of ICC and NHL were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. After a mean of 6.91 years of follow-up, there were 18 cases of ICC and 192 cases of NHL, including 99 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Incidence rates of ICC were 0.09 and 0.43 per 100,000 person-years, respectively, among women who were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-seronegative and HBsAg-seropositive, showing an age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR(adj) ) (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 4.80 (1.88-12.20). The incidence rates of NHL overall for HBsAg-seronegative and HBsAg-seropositive women were 1.23 and 3.18 per 100,000 person-years, respectively, with an HR(adj) (95% CI) of 2.63 (1.95-3.54).

A complete analysis of neoplasms and opportunistic infections from this material as well as a discussion of pathologic features that may be associated only with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is presented and compared with national data. Among the neoplasms nodular Kaposi's sarcoma was present post-mortem in only 15.8% of cases as compared with a national autopsy incidence of approximately 50%. This figure was highly significant (Z = -5.439 where significance occurs at more than +/- 1.96) and indicates that the Chicago AIDS population is distinct from the national AIDS population in terms of Kaposi's sarcoma. There were no parallel differences in possible cofactors to account for this lower incidence in Chicago. Inflammatory Kaposi's sarcoma was present in 3 cases but did not approach the near 100% figure reported by others. A discussion of this entity and possible reasons for confusion in its diagnosis are discussed. Chicago continues to have a low incidence of AIDS for a large metropolitan area (308 cases/million population) and a continuing low incidence of nodular Kaposi's sarcoma reported clinically. We hypothesize that either some as yet unidentified agent, not generally present in the Chicago population at risk for AIDS, is responsible for the initiation of Kaposi's sarcoma or that the particular HIV-1 isolate in Chicago is not associated with this malignancy."

After specificity and sensitivity testing, three new rapid diagnostic test kits were tested in parallel with six commonly used diagnostic test kits. The Determine HIV-1/2 test had fewer indeterminate or equivocal results than the Capillus HIV-1/HIV-2 or HIV Blot 2.2 tests. However, the Determine HIV-1/2 test yielded one false-positive result when compared with the Serodia HIV, HIV Blot 2.2, and microparticle enzyme immunoassay (IMx) HIV tests. The Serodia HBsAg test yielded more false-negative results when compared with the Determine HBsAg diagnostic test kit. The results of the syphilis diagnostic tests evaluated in this clinical trial consistently agreed with those of the rapid plasma reagin test for syphilis. The Determine Syphilis Treponema pallidum (TP) test had three false-positive results compared with the Serodia TP and the Serodia TP x particle agglutination (PA) tests, which had two false-positive results that were confirmed as negative by an ELISA. Application of these serologic tests within this comparative evaluation framework, using the World Health Organization alternative testing strategies, proved to be an effective way to determine serostatus related to HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis."
6110,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated the association between two antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence measurements--the medication possession ratio (MPR) and patient self-report--and detectable HIV viremia in the setting of rapid service scale-up in Lusaka, Zambia. Drug adherence and outcomes were assessed in a subset of patients suspected of treatment failure based on discordant clinical and immunologic responses to ART. A total of 913 patients were included in this analysis, with a median time of 744 days (Q1, Q3: 511, 919 days) from ART initiation to viral load (VL) measurement. On aggregate over the period of follow-up, 531 (58%) had optimal adherence (MPR > or =95%), 306 (34%) had suboptimal adherence (MPR 80-94%), and 76 (8%) had poor adherence (MPR <80%). Of the 913 patients, 238 (26%) had VL > or =400 copies/ml when tested. When compared to individuals with optimal adherence, there was increasing risk for virologic failure in those with suboptimal adherence [adjusted relative risk (ARR): 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, 1.6] and those with poor adherence (ARR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.4) based on MPR. During the antiretroviral treatment course, 676 patients (74%) reported no missed doses. The proportion of patients with virologic failure did not differ significantly among those reporting any missed dose from those reporting perfect adherence (26% vs. 26%, p = 0.97). Among patients with suspected treatment failure, a lower MPR was associated with higher rates of detectable viremia. However, the suboptimal sensitivity and specificity of MPR limit its utility as a sole predictor of virologic failure."
6532,0.005,1.0000,"This study describes the social networks of secondary school students in Moshi Municipality, and their association with self-rated risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 300 students aged 15-24 years in 5 secondary schools in Moshi, Tanzania. Bonding networks were defined as social groupings of students participating in activities within the school, while bridging networks were groups that included students participating in social groupings from outside of the school environs. A structured questionnaire was used to ask about participation in bonding and bridging social networks and self-rated HIV risk behavior. More participants participated in bonding networks (72%) than in bridging networks (29%). Participation in bridging networks was greater among females (25%) than males (12%, p<.005). Of 300 participants, 88 (29%) were sexually experienced, and of these 62 (70%) considered themselves to be at low risk of HIV infection. Factors associated with self-rated risk of HIV included: type of school (p<.003), family structure (p<.008), being sexually experienced (p<.004), having had sex in the past three months (p<.009), having an extra sexual partner (p<.054) and non-condom use in last sexual intercourse (p<.001), but not the presence or type of social capital. The study found no association between bonding and bridging social networks on self-rated risk of HIV among study participants. However, sexually experienced participants rated themselves at low risk of HIV infection despite practicing unsafe sex. Efforts to raise adolescents' self-awareness of risk of HIV infection through life skills education and HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome risk reduction strategies may be beneficial to students in this at-risk group."
1290,0.005,1.0000,"RANTES has been found to suppress human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. To further elucidate the role of this chemokine in HIV-1 infection, RANTES levels were analyzed in serum and platelet-free plasma (PFP) in 53 HIV-1-infected patients and 20 controls. RANTES levels were significantly elevated in both serum and PFP in all clinical stages of HIV-1 infection, with the highest levels in CDC groups A and B. In longitudinal testing, the progressors were characterized by a pronounced decline in serum levels over time; the nonprogressors, however, had only a slight reduction or an increase in RANTES levels. During 16 weeks of indinavir therapy, there was an increase in circulating RANTES levels and enhanced release of RANTES from stimulated CD8+ lymphocytes. The decline in RANTES levels along with disease progression is compatible with RANTES having a beneficial role in HIV-1-infected patients. The increase in RANTES levels during protease inhibitor-containing regimens may represent a previously unrecognized immunologic effect of such therapy."
7995,0.005,1.0000,"The first use of lentiviral vectors in humans involved transduction of mature T-cells with an human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived env antisense (envAS) vector to protect cells from HIV infection. In that study, only a minority of the patient T-cell population could be gene-modified, raising the question of whether the altered cells could affect replicating HIV populations. We investigated this using humanized NOD/SCID IL-2Rgamma(null) (hNSG) mice reconstituted with approximately 4-11% envAS-modified human T-cells. Mice were challenged with HIV-1(NL4-3), which has an env perfectly complementary to envAS, or with HIV-1(BaL), which has a divergent env. No differences were seen in viral titer between mice that received envAS-modified cells and control mice that did not. Using 454/Roche pyrosequencing, we analyzed the mutational spectrum in HIV populations in serum-from 33 mice we recovered 84,074 total reads comprising 31,290 unique sequence variants. We found enrichment of A-to-G transitions and deletions in envAS-treated mice, paralleling a previous tissue culture study where most target cells contained envAS, even though minority of cells were envAS-modified here. Unexpectedly, this enrichment was only detected after the challenge with HIV-1(BaL), where the viral genome would form an imperfect duplex with envAS, and not HIV-1(NL4-3), where a perfectly matched duplex would form."
8344,0.005,1.0000,"Hematologic abnormalities occur in the majority of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Infection of the hematopoietic progenitor cells has been proposed as a potential explanation. In this study, different bone marrow cell populations, including the CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, were purified by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) and analyzed for the presence of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. A group of 14 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) was studied (11 with peripheral blood cytopenias). The CD4+ helper cells in the bone marrow were found positive for HIV-1 DNA in all patients. In contrast, CD34+ progenitor cells were positive in only one patient. Two monocyte samples and two samples of CD4-/CD34- lymphocytes/blasts (mainly B and CD8 lymphocytes) were positive. Proviral DNA could not be detected in granulocytes. FACS analysis showed that the percentage of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells was not altered in the bone marrow of AIDS patients in comparison with the HIV-1 seronegative controls. In contrast, the number of CD4+ lymphocytes was markedly reduced in the bone marrow of AIDS patients. These results show that the hematologic abnormalities in AIDS patients are neither explained by direct infection of the hematopoietic progenitor cells with HIV-1 nor by a depletion of progenitor cells."
8336,0.005,1.0000,"Altered T cell adherence after human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection may contribute to viral pathogenesis in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. To address this hypothesis, we assessed mechanisms of T cell adherence to extracellular matrix proteins in vitro. We found that after HIV-1 infection, both chronically infected H9 CD4+ T cells and acutely infected primary peripheral blood lymphocytes acquired the ability to adhere to the extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin, to a lesser extent to type IV collagen and laminin, but not to type I collagen. H9 cells chronically infected with two of the three HIV-1 strains studied showed approximately a sevenfold increase in attachment to fibronectin, while the same cells infected with the human retrovirus HIV-2 did not. Adhesion was accompanied by changes in morphology, including marked spreading and increased filopodia. These alterations were not blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7, which did inhibit TPA-induced T cell attachment to fibronectin. Monoclonal antibodies against both the alpha 5 and the beta 1 subunits of the classical fibronectin receptor as well as an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide inhibited attachment, whereas anti-alpha 4 monoclonal antibodies and the CS1 peptide did not. Binding to collagen IV was also inhibited by the anti-beta 1 monoclonal antibody, but not the other antibodies. Cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and analyzed by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-beta 1 integrin antibody showed a 2.5-fold increase in integrin synthesis in infected cells compared to uninfected controls. This increase in synthesis was associated with an increase in cell surface expression of both alpha 5 and beta 1 integrins by FACS (registered trademark of Becton Dickinson for a fluorescence-activated cell sorter) analysis. Enhanced expression of integrins such as alpha 5 beta 1 may cause T cell adherence to a variety of tissues, where released viral gene products may induce some of the tissue-specific manifestations of HIV-1 infection."

7317,0.005,1.0000,"The accessibility of high active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for local human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients is improving in Rwanda. It is well known that this therapy is associated with serious adverse effects, such as metabolic and morphologic changes. One of the recommended preventive modalities for these complications is participation in physical activity. The current study aims to determine the anthropometric profile and physical activity levels among people living with HIV and receiving HAART in Kigali, Rwanda. The study was a cross-sectional, descriptive quantitative survey. The participant's levels of physical activity participation and their association with anthropometric profiles were measured, using a structured self-administered questionnaire for 407 clients passing through the clinics. Of the participants, approximately 70% were inactive and in addition, 40% were obese and 43% overweight. Obesity was found to be strongly associated with inactivity. Lack of motivation, and time as well as fear of worsening the disease were found to be barriers to participation in physical activity."
1931,0.005,1.0000,"The factors that predispose patients undergoing liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV) disease to severe recurrence of infection are unclear. In this study we examined the effect of pretransplantation infection with HBV and precore variant strains of HBV on posttransplantation outcome and allograft histology in 24 patients who survived more than 3 months after liver transplantation. Based on pretransplantation serum HBV DNA status as detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing, the 24 patients could be assigned to three groups. In group 1 there were 4 patients HBV DNA-negative before transplantation and none of these patients suffered recurrence of infection posttransplantation. In group 2, of 10 patients with pretransplantation infection with wild-type virus, 7 became reinfected, and 1 of these developed HBV-related graft failure. In group 3, 9 of 10 patients infected with precore mutant HBV strains became reinfected. However, in contrast to the patients in group 2, 7 patients in group 3 developed HBV-related graft loss, and 5 of these patients had fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (FCH). These results indicate that infection with precore mutant strains of HBV predisposes a patient to early graft loss following transplantation."
4724,0.005,1.0000,"Knowledge about epidemiological distribution patterns of HIV infection in different geographic regions is relevant to understand the dynamics of the disease in Brazil. This study aims to characterize the epidemiological and clinical profile of HIV-infected patients from Southwestern Goias State, from 2005 to 2015. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect clinical-epidemiological, virological, and immunological data from the medical records of all HIV-infected patients (n=539) who were followed at the regional reference center of Jatai, Goias State, Brazil, from 2005 to 2015. We detected the prevalence of male patients and the heterosexual route of transmission, as well as an expressive number of young women infected with HIV. The HIV infection was more prevalent in reproductive ages (55.3%). Most patients presented clinical manifestations related to HIV infection at the time of diagnosis. Twenty-four patients presented coinfection with hepatitis C virus, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, leprosy or Chagas disease. Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii was the most common opportunistic infection, followed by neurotoxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and neurocryptococcosis. Combined antiretroviral therapy improved CD4+ T-cell counts: the mean CD4+ T-cell counts after treatment was twice as high as those found at the first medical appointment; and highly active antiretroviral therapy promoted viral suppression in a significant number of patients. Considering the increasing distribution of HIV infection to the interior of Brazil, this descriptive study outlines the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of HIV infection in Southwestern Goias and contributes to develop local prevention strategies and public service plans."
719,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is responsible for 4. 5% of AIDS cases in Portugal. Six HIV-2 subtypes have been described so far, subtype A being proposed as more pathogenic than the rest. The relationship between the clinical status and levels of both cellular and plasma HIV-2 viraemia is not well known, nor their modifications under antiretroviral therapy. Thirty-two consecutive HIV-2 infected persons (17 men, 15 women) attending two different hospitals in Lisbon in 1997 were enrolled prospectively in the study. All but 4 individuals most likely acquired the infection through heterosexual contact. More than half of the study population was of African origin, mainly from Guinea-Bissau. Eleven (34.4%) patients had developed clinical manifestations included within the B or C groups of the CDC classification system for HIV infection, with the rest being asymptomatic. Half of the population was undergoing antiretroviral treatment at the time of the study. HIV-2 subtypes were investigated using a new Nef-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method that allows differentiation of the main two variants, A and B. Plasma viral load was quantified using a new quantitative competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QcRT-PCR) procedure as well as the Amp-RT assay. Virus isolation was attempted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. All but one person carried HIV-2 subtype A. Plasma viraemia examined by QcRT-PCR was measurable in 15 (50%) of 30 subjects, yielding in all instances values below 20,000 HIV-2 RNA copies per ml. Plasma RT activity could be detected in only 10 (33%) of 30 subjects, a rate much lower than that seen in HIV-1 infection. Virus was isolated from 16 (53.3%) of 30 patients. A significant correlation was found between CD4+ counts, clinical status, rate of virus isolation, and plasma viral load by both QcRT-PCR and Amp-RT. In conclusion, HIV-2 subtype A is the predominant variant circulating in Portugal among both natives and immigrants. A lower cellular and plasma viral load with respect to HIV-1 was seen in persons without immunosuppression, from whom the rate of virus recovery was extremely low."
8543,0.005,1.0000,"Liver disease in patients coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) has received increasing attention in recent years. Steatosis is accepted as an important contributor to liver disease in patients with HCV, but despite coinfected patients having several reasons to have steatosis, the prevalence and significance of such changes has received scant attention. We examined steatosis in an unselected cohort of coinfected patients and compared its prevalence and predictors with findings in monoinfected patients, where these relationships have been established. We studied 92 coinfected and 372 monoinfected patients undergoing staging liver biopsy. Baseline characteristics of the two groups differed significantly, pointing at different contributors to steatosis in each. Histological inflammation and fibrosis were very similar in the two groups, but steatosis was less in coinfected patients. Steatosis had a univariate association with fibrosis in both groups, but retained a multivariate association only in monoinfected patients. Other multivariate predictors of steatosis in monoinfected patients were the accepted variables of elevated body mass index, male sex, and genotype 3a infection, as well as age. In coinfected patients, however, age was the only multivariate predictor. Undetectable HIV viral load was associated with steatosis in coinfected patients in univariate analysis, but highly active antiretroviral therapy or its individual components could not be initially linked to steatosis. In conclusion, steatosis is less common in HIV/HCV coinfected patients than similar HCV monoinfected patients, and predictors of steatosis differ between the two groups."
4856,0.005,1.0000,"In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-1 infection frequently occurs in the context of other coinfecting pathogens, most importantly, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and malaria parasites. The consequences are often devastating, resulting in enhanced morbidity and mortality. Due to the large number of confounding factors influencing pathogenesis in coinfected people, we sought to develop a nonhuman primate model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-malaria coinfection. In sub-Saharan Africa, Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria parasite and is responsible for most malaria-induced deaths. The simian malaria parasite Plasmodium fragile can induce clinical symptoms, including cerebral malaria in rhesus macaques, that resemble those of P. falciparum infection in humans. Thus, based on the well-characterized rhesus macaque model of SIV infection, this study reports the development of a novel rhesus macaque SIV-P. fragile coinfection model to study human HIV-P. falciparum coinfection. Using this model, we show that coinfection is associated with an increased, although transient, risk of both HIV and malaria transmission. Specifically, SIV-P. fragile coinfected macaques experienced an increase in SIV viremia that was temporarily associated with an increase in potential SIV target cells and systemic immune activation during acute parasitemia. Conversely, primary parasitemia in SIV-P. fragile coinfected animals resulted in higher gametocytemia that subsequently translated into higher oocyst development in mosquitoes. To our knowledge, this is the first animal model able to recapitulate the increased transmission risk of both HIV and malaria in coinfected humans. Therefore, this model could serve as an essential tool to elucidate distinct immunological, virological, and/or parasitological parameters underlying disease exacerbation in HIV-malaria coinfected people."
6431,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B infection is one of the infectious diseases quite common in Turkey and around the world. Hepatitis B virus infection is a significant health problem which may cause chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. With the introduction of Hepatitis B vaccine, a significant progress has been made in the prevention of HBV infections. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the characteristics of the individuals included in the risk group who admitted to our vaccination clinic, as well as their immune responses following the vaccination. Among the patients admitted to the vaccination clinic of our hospital between January 2003-December 2005 and that were included in the risk group (patients who have family members with chronic Hepatitis B infection, healthcare workers, hemodialysis patients etc.), those who were included in the vaccination program by examining the results of HBs Ag, anti-HBc and anti-HBs were evaluated in terms of their characteristics (age, gender, smoking etc.) and results of Anti-HBs score. A total of 958 people were included in the vaccination program. Upon evaluation in terms of risk factors, presence of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection in the family was found to be 80.6% (772/958), being healthcare worker was 9.2% (88/958), HCV positivity and chronic liver disease was 3.0% (29/958), being a hemodialysis patient was 2.8% (27/958), and being an oncology patient was 2.1% (20/958). Post-vaccination immune response could be evaluated in 69.8% (669/958) of patients and no responsiveness to vaccine was detected only in 8.1% (54/669) of them. Of the non-responders, 64.8% (35/54) were hemodialysis and oncology patients. Anti-HBs positivity rate following hepatitis B vaccination program was found compatible with the results of previous studies. With this vaccine of considerably high effectiveness, immunization of the entire community including primarily the risk groups should be targeted."

9090,0.005,1.0000,"A synthetic peptide, RPI 312, that specifically inhibits the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) showed a potent inhibition on virus production, maturation, and infectivity. Treatment with this agent prevented the cleavage of Gag protein at the site between p17 and p24 in HIV-1 chronically infected MOLT-4 cells as well as in the released virus. Passage of HIV-1 in the presence of gradually increasing concentrations of this protease inhibitor resulted in emergence of a variant that could evade the drug effects. In the resistant variant the maturation of Gag proteins appeared normal, but its infectivity was reduced compared with that of the parent virus. The nucleotides coding the amino acids at and around the cleavage site between Gag proteins p17 and p24 were not changed. One point mutation (A-->G) at site 2082 of the pol gene that resulted in one amino acid change at site 84 of the protease from isoleucine to valine (I-84-->V) could be detected in the resistant variant. An HIV-1 infectious DNA clone with the I-84-->V mutation also showed reduced sensitivity to this protease inhibitor. The findings that the resistant variant had lower infectivity and was still affected by higher doses of the drug support the speculation that resistance to protease inhibitors may not be as problematic as other drug resistance."
2062,0.005,1.0000,"The role of the thymus in HIV-1 pathogenesis remains unclear. We developed an assay to quantify the number of recent thymic emigrants in blood based on the detection of a major excisional DNA byproduct (termed alpha1 circle) of T cell receptor rearrangement. By studying 532 normal individuals, we found that alpha1 circle numbers in blood remain high for the first 10-15 yr of life, a sharp drop is seen in the late teen years, and a gradual decline occurs thereafter. Compared with age-matched uninfected control individuals, alpha1 circle numbers in HIV-1-infected adults were significantly reduced; however, there were many individuals with normal alpha1 circle numbers. In 74 individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, we found no appreciable effect on alpha1 circle numbers in those whose baseline values were already within the normal range, but significant increases were observed in those with a preexisting impairment. The increases in alpha1 circle numbers were, however, numerically insufficient to account for the rise in levels of naive T lymphocytes. Overall, it is difficult to invoke thymic regenerative failure as a generalized mechanism for CD4 lymphocyte depletion in HIV-1 infection, as alpha1 circle numbers are normal in a substantial subset of HIV-1-infected individuals."

The association of HPV16 and 18 variant lineages with race, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, CD4+ T-cell count, HIV-RNA level, time-to-clearance of HPV infection and presence of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) among women in the Women's Interagency HIV Study was studied. Subjects were followed semi-annually with Pap smear and cervicovaginal lavage (CVL). HPV DNA was detected in CVLs using MY09/11 L1 PCR assay. Specimens positive for HPV16/18 underwent E6 PCR and sequencing to determine the variant present. Specimens from 195 HPV16- and 162 HPV18-positive women were classified into variant lineages based on sequencing results. African variants of HPV16 and HPV18 were significantly more prevalent among African-Americans than among Caucasians [42 versus 14 % (P=0.001) and 60 versus 13 % (P<0.001), respectively]. However, it was not possible to detect associations between the HPV16 or 18 variant lineages and other factors studied. African variants of HPV16/18 were more common in women of African descent living outside Africa, which could reflect mixing behaviours and/or immunogenetic factors. However, in a large population of HIV-infected women, the variant of HPV16 or 18 was unrelated to persistence of infection or presence of SIL. If non-European variants are more oncogenic, the effect may involve a late stage in cervical tumorigenesis."

The antiviral activity was determined in the tetracycline-responsive HepAD38 and HepAD79 cells, which are stably transfected with either a cDNA copy of the wild-type pregenomic RNA or with cDNA containing the M550V mutation. As expected, lamivudine was much less ( approximately 200-fold) effective at inhibiting replication of the M550V mutant virus than the wild-type virus. In contrast, adefovir, tenofovir, lobucavir, L-FMAU, DXG and DAPD proved almost equally effective against both viruses. A second objective of this study was to directly compare the antiviral potency of the anti-HBV agents in HepG2 2.2.15 cells (which are routinely used for anti-HBV drug-screening purposes) with that in HepAD38 cells. HepAD38 cells produce much larger quantities of HBV than HepG2 2.2.15 cells, and thus allow drug screening in a multiwell plate format. All compounds were found to be almost equally effective at inhibiting HBV replication in HepAD38 cells (as in HepG2 2.2.15 cells), except for penciclovir, which was clearly less effective in HepAD38 cells."
7231,0.005,1.0000,"Recent genome-wide association studies report that the SNP rs8099917, located 8.9 kb upstream of the start codon of IL28B, is associated with both disease chronicity and therapeutic response to pegIFN-Œ± and RBV in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. To determine the effect of rs8099917 variation on the response of HCV to therapy, we genotyped this variant in a cohort of 160 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients in our clinic unit who received combined peg-IFN-Œ±/RBV therapy. The rs8099917 T/G or G/G genotypes were observed in 56 patients (35%). Treatment failure occurred in 80% of G-allele carriers versus 48% of non-carriers (P<0.0001). This result reveals that the G allele was strongly associated with treatment failure in this patient cohort. Importantly, a highly significant association was found between the G-allele and response to therapy in HCV genotype 1-infected patients (P<0.0001) but not in HCV genotype 3-infected patients. Multivariate analysis (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval; P value) indicated that the rs8099917 TT genotype was a strong predictor of treatment success (5.83; 1.26-26.92; P = 0.021), independent of baseline plasma HCV-RNA load less than 500 000 IU/ml (4.85; 1.18-19.95; P = 0.025) and absence of advanced liver fibrosis (5.24; 1.20-22.91; P = 0.025). These results reveal the high prevalence of the rs8099917 G allele in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients as well as its strong association with treatment failure in HCV genotype 1-infected patients. rs8099917 SNP genotyping may be a valid pre-treatment predictor of which patients are likely to respond to treatment in this group of difficult-to-treat HCV/HIV-infected patients."
3078,0.005,1.0000,"To examine whether recent intravenous use of cocaine might be associated with increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection, the authors studied 2,597 active intravenous drug users: 2,399 with recent cocaine injection and 198 with recent injection of heroin or other drugs but not cocaine. These subjects were adult residents of Baltimore City and the surrounding Maryland counties, recruited via outreach into the community between February 1988 and March 1989. In contrast to the first report on the cocaine-HIV association, the present study sample was not recruited solely from drug treatment programs. In the present study, estimated HIV seroprevalence was 26.4% for recent cocaine injectors as compared with 10.6% among all other recent intravenous drug users; the relative odds estimate was 3.03. In the untreated segment of the sample, HIV seroprevalence was 26.0% for recent cocaine injectors as compared with 8.9% among others (relative odds (RO) = 3.61). The estimated degree of association did not change appreciably when multiple logistic regression was used to hold constant potentially confounding and/or mediating variables such as receptive anal intercourse, number of sex partners, and use of injection equipment obtained at shooting galleries (RO = 2.64). Augmenting these cross-sectional data, preliminary prospective data showed excess risk of HIV seroconversion among recent cocaine injectors (estimated relative risk = 2.11). While other research has examined the cocaine-HIV association, the present study differs in that it has allowed a test for whether the association was a spurious artifact of studying drug users recruited solely from drug treatment programs, a broad array of alternative determinants of HIV infection have been held constant, and the association has been examined with seroconversion data. The results lend support to the abiding concern about the risk of HIV infection among cocaine users."
6350,0.005,1.0000,"Using a hepatitis B virus (HBV) transgenic mouse model, we previously showed that a single dose of double-stranded adeno-associated virus (dsAAV) vector serotype 8 carrying a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) effectively reduces HBV replication and gene expression, but the effect gradually decreases with time. In this report, we compared the anti-HBV RNA interference (RNAi) effect of dsAAV8 with those of dsAAV7 and dsAAV9, two other hepatotropic AAV vectors, and examined whether the sequential use of these heterologous AAV vectors could prolong the anti-HBV effect. Our results showed that shRNA delivered by each of the three dsAAV vectors profoundly reduced the serum HBV titer and liver HBV mRNA and DNA levels in the transgenic mice for up to 22 weeks, with dsAAV8 having the greatest inhibitory effect, followed by dsAAV9 and dsAAV7. The potency of dsAAV8 correlated with the presence of higher levels of vector DNA and anti-HBV shRNA in the liver. An in vivo cross-administration experiment showed that preexisting anti-AAV8 antibody completely blocked the anti-HBV RNAi effect of dsAAV8, but had no effect on the potency of dsAAV7 and dsAAV9. Moreover, we demonstrated that a longer anti-HBV effect could be achieved by the sequential use of dsAAV8 and dsAAV9. These results indicate that effective and persistent HBV suppression might be achieved by a combination of the power of RNAi silencing effect and multiple treatments with different AAV serotypes.Molecular Therapy (2009) 17 2, 352-359 doi:10.1038/mt.2008.245."
6709,0.005,1.0000,"The national blood transfusion policies have been changed significantly in recent years in Turkey. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and HIV in blood donors at the Red Crescent Center in Istanbul and to evaluate the effect of changes in the national blood transfusion policies on the prevalence of these infections. The screening results of 72695 blood donations at the Red Crescent Center in Istanbul between January and December 2007 were evaluated retrospectively. HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV-1/2 were screened by microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) method. Samples found to be positive for anti-HIV 1/2 and anti-HCV were confirmed by Inno-Lia HCV Ab III and Inno-Lia HIV I/II Score, respectively. The seropositivity rates for HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV-1/2 were determined as 1.76%, 0.07%, and 0.008%, respectively. Compared to the previously published data from Red Crescent Centers in Turkey, it was found that HBV and HCV seroprevalances decreased and HIV seroprevalance increased in recent years. In conclusion, we believe that the drop in HBV and HCV prevalence rates are likely multifactorial and may have resulted from more diligent donor questioning upon screening, a higher level of public awareness on viral hepatitis as well as the expansion of HBV vaccination coverage in Turkey. Another factor to contribute to the decreased prevalence of HCV stems from the use of more sensitive confirmation testing on all reactive results, thereby eliminating a fair amount of false positive cases. Despite similar transmission routes, the increase in HIV prevalence in contrast to HBV and HCV may be linked to the increase in AIDS cases in Turkey in recent years."
1322,0.005,1.0000,"An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to clear infection. As HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus, a role for TLR7 in the immune response against HCV is possible, and early clinical studies have demonstrated an antiviral effect of TLR7 stimulation. We tested the hypothesis that genetic variations of TLR7 are associated with chronic HCV-infection and outcome of therapy. The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7 variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to patients with other chronic liver diseases and to healthy controls (P < 0.05). In contrast, c.2403 G>A was less prevalent in male patients with chronic HCV-infection (P < 0.05). No association was observed for the third variant, c.1-120T>G. Haplotype analysis confirmed the differential distribution of TLR7 variants between the groups. Within the group of female patients with chronic HCV-infection, c.32T was predictive of an unfavourable outcome of interferon-alpha therapy (P < 0.05). This study reports the association of TLR7 variants with chronic HCV-infection and with the response to interferon-alpha therapy in patients with chronic HCV-infection. Our results suggest that variations of TLR7 impair the immune response to HCV and imply a gender-specific effect of this X-chromosomal variation."
4228,0.005,1.0000,"The present study sought to extend prior work, showing an association between self-reported distress tolerance and self-reported antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence, by conducting a multimethod test of the association between distress tolerance and objective measures of ART adherence among a sample of 140 individuals (23.6% female) with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Findings indicated that, after accounting for negative affectivity and ART side-effect severity, distress tolerance was significantly associated with pill count adherence as well as viral load. Specifically, a differential association was observed whereby self-reported distress tolerance was associated with pill count adherence, whereas behavioral distress tolerance was associated with viral load. Importantly, no associations were observed between either measure of distress tolerance and CD4 count. Findings are discussed in terms of the importance of both behavioral and perceived distress tolerance assessment among patients with HIV as well as potential clinical implications related to the integration of distress tolerance-focused treatments into existing interventions for individuals with HIV."
2607,0.005,1.0000,"The study examined the relationship between coping and psychosocial variables (psychological stress symptoms, locus of control, emotional repression, and social support) among 108 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The authors administered several tests, including one that measures fighting spirit and degree of hopelessness, to assess each patient's individual coping style. The patients who were adjusting well to their HIV-positive status tended to have a higher level of fighting spirit and lower degree of hopelessness than those patients who were not adjusting well to their HIV-positive status. A coping style based on incapacity to face and confront HIV infection was associated with symptoms of psychological stress, repression of anger, external locus of control, and low social support in the latter group. These patients showed symptoms indicating maladjustment to HIV infection (43% of the sample) and differed from the ""noncases"" (the well-adjusted patients) in that the former group reported inadequate coping responses (lower fighting spirit and higher hopelessness, fatalistic attitude, and anxious preoccupation) and poorer social support, and had a greater tendency to repress anger and express sadness. The data support the hypothesis that coping with HIV infection is a complex phenomenon involving multiple and interacting variables. Interventions aimed at improving the coping style for many HIV patients are needed."

A retrospective study of participants consecutively recruited at the UCSD HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program examined effects of combined ART and SGAs on body mass index (BMI), nonfasting serum lipids, diabetes mellitus (DM) incidence, and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Metabolic outcome variables and covariates were compared using t-tests, Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests. Linear and logistic multivariable models explored metabolic outcomes for participants taking (SGA+) or not taking (SGA-) concomitant SGAs, after controlling for demographic and HIV disease- and ART-related covariates. Of 2229 HIV-infected participants, 12% (N=258) were treated with SGAs. In multivariable models adjusted for relevant covariates, the SGA+ group had significantly higher mean triglycerides, significantly higher odds of DM, significantly higher MAPs and marginally higher BMI. The use of SGAs in HIV-infected adults taking ART was independently associated with worse indicators of MetS and cardiovascular risk. Aggressive monitoring for the metabolic complications from concurrent SGA and ART is indicated in all patients receiving these medication combinations. "
9140,0.005,1.0000,"Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) remains a significant HIV-associated opportunistic infection in Southeast Asia and Africa, with a high burden of disease and a high mortality rate despite the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We retrospectively examined the utility of cryptococcal antigen screening to identify risk for CM among 211 Thai women initiating ART. Antigenemia prevalence was 11% (n = 9) among 84 women with a CD4 count <100 cells/mm(3). Screening identified all women who later developed CM. Cryptococcal antigen titers decreased over time with ART. Our study confirmed findings from previous studies in Thailand and South Africa and provided novel observational data regarding the course of cryptococcal antigenemia in patients initiating ART and the poor efficacy of low-dose fluconazole prophylaxis in preventing CM among patients with antigenemia."
5477,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to determine hepatitis co-infection in a cohort of HIV infected patients at their inclusion in the Senegalese Initiative of ART Access. B, C, and D Hepatitis viruses serological markers were checked retrospectively on 363 stored plasma. For HBV, the Abbott laboratories equipment IMx was used to detect HBs Ag and anti Core Ab on negative HBs Ag samples. For HDV, anti Delta Ab was performed using the Abbott Murex Kit on all HBs Ag positive samples. For HCV, anti HCV Ab was detected by IMx as double screening test and confirmed by INNO-LIA(TM) HCV Core of Innogenetics laboratories. The statistical analysis was done with STATA V8. The study population was composed of 164 men and 199 women aged between 16 and 66 years. The immune and virological markers averages at their enrollment were 154 cell/mm(3) for TLCD4+ (n = 355 patients) and 4.9 log for viral load (n = 277 patients). HBs Ag was found in 61 patients or 16.8% and the prevalence of anti-HBc Ab was 83.2% (252/295). 2 patients or 3% on HBs Ag positive sample presents HBV/HDV co-infection Ab anti HCV was detects in 6 patients or 1.6% after confirmation and 2 patients had triple infection with HBV. These results showed that the prevalence of HBV and HCV in the population of persons living with HIV/AIDS in Senegal is similar to that found in the general population. Our data indicated that hepatitis pathology in the PLwHIV was essentially due to HBV. Further studies are needed to diagnose occult hepatitis in order to set up therapeutic strategies taking into account co-infections by hepatitis viruses in the ART programmes."
7387,0.005,1.0000,"Oral manifestations in HIV infections are numerous and some of these are acknowledged as being of great importance in the early diagnosis of the disease. Many HIV-associated oral infections occur early in HIV disease, not infrequently as the presenting sign or symptom. Thus, early detection of the associated oral opportunistic infections should, in many cases, result in earlier diagnosis of HIV infection. Cytology, a simple, painless, and inexpensive method, has become a preferred method and was used in our study for early diagnosis of certain lesions. To determine the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy on incidence rate of opportunistic infections among HIV-positive adults in a teaching hospital in India, a prospective study was conducted and the required sample size was 40. Study participants were selected randomly from the outpatient department of an HIV clinic who were currently on for antiretroviral therapy (ART). Data on age, gender, form of contagion, antiretroviral therapy at the time of review, number of CD4 lymphocytes per milliliter, and viral load were collected. Oral cytologic investigation was carried out and then stained for histopathological examination. A total of 40 individuals were examined and the incidence of opportunistic infections was 66.7% in individuals with CD4 counts less than 200, 55.6% in individuals with CD4 counts of 200 to 499, and 40.0% in individuals with CD4 counts more than 500. The incidence of opportunistic infection was higher in individuals with low CD4 counts in spite of being on ART."
1096,0.005,1.0000,"U.S. AIDS rates have declined among same population groups; however, African-Americans and other ethnic minorities have experienced the least amount of decline. As a result medical and public health authorities are tasked with developing strategies to help eliminate the disparity in HIV/AIDS incidence rate and clinical outcomes. Thus, in 1999, the National Minority AIDS Education and Training Center (NMAETC) was developed to facilitate training, clinical consultation and technical assistance to clinicians that provide care to HIV-infected minority patients. Its initial activities were designed solely to increase providers' clinical capacity to use state-of-art anti-retroviral therapies to treat and manage the disease. However, through focused discussions with target providers and a survey of medical care service sites, the NMAETC confirms that provider' training and assistance needs extend into non-medical domains."
4663,0.005,1.0000,"Most studies of the medical costs of HIV infection focus on the terminal stage of this chronic illness when the patients have developed AIDS or severe HIV disease and in-patient care dominates. Data are also needed on the medical costs during the prolonged phase of HIV infection preceding severe terminal illness and the effects it may have on the provision of outpatient care. The study population was derived from a cohort study of factory workers and their spouses in Tanzania. Morbidity and outpatient health services utilization are estimated for 1832 adults who on average had been enrolled for two years and utilized the study clinic. Among those who had been enrolled at least 2 years, 50 cases (HIV+ since enrollment) and 150 control (HIV- until last visit) were selected, matched by age, sex and income level to estimate expenditure on drugs by HIV status. There was an increase in morbidity during HIV infection: the incidence of clinical diagnoses was 30% higher among HIV-positive than among HIV-negative adults (p < 0.001). HIV-infected adults also made more frequent use of the outpatient services (23% higher utilization). Estimates of essential drug costs among the subsample showed a 15% increase for HIV infected adults compared to HIV-negative adults, caused by higher use of antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs. The overall increase in morbidity, outpatient care services utilization and essential drug use due to HIV infection was limited, as HIV prevalence in this adult population was 11%. For example, the net proportion of all illness episodes attributable to HIV infection was 3.2%. Possible biases are discussed and suggest that our findings are a minimum estimate of the effect of adult HIV infection on outpatient care costs. There is a need for more studies in different settings to assess the impact of HIV infection on outpatient care in developing countries."
2104,0.005,1.0000,"Barriers to retention in HIV care are detrimental to patients' progress along the HIV continuum of care. Previous literature has focused on individual, client-level barriers, and interventions to address them. In contrast, less work has examined the role of system-level barriers on HIV care outcomes. This study seeks to understand how individual and systemic barriers individually are associated with clinic appointment attendance and virologic suppression in HIV-infected patients attending the largest HIV clinic in Miami-Dade, FL. In addition, we examined the synergistic effects of these barriers as potential syndemic factors on these health outcomes. Barriers to clinic attendance were determined in a face-to-face study interview with 444 HIV-infected outpatients (187 regular attenders, 191 irregular attenders, and 66 nonattenders) identified from electronic medical records. Compared with the other attendance groups, nonattenders had higher viral loads, were less likely to be virologically suppressed, had lower CD4 counts, had higher depressive symptoms, life chaos, lower quality of life, and higher rates of food insecurity, and recent drug use. Additionally, nonattenders compared with regular attenders had lower physician relationship ratings, had lower medical information clarity and more often reported transportation as a barrier to clinic attendance. When viewed as a syndemic, compared with patients not reporting any barriers, patients with 3 or more individual-level barriers were more likely to have a detectable viral load (odds ratio = 3.60, 95% CI: 1.71 to 7.61). Our findings suggest that patients presenting to the clinic with multiple barriers should be prioritized for assistance and future interventions to improve retention in care. Interventions should address multiple individual and system-level barriers simultaneously with particular attention to addressing depressive symptoms, organizational skills, relationship with the physician, and HIV-related health education.

1095,0.005,1.0000,"Cross-sectional studies to date that examine psychosocial correlates of antiretroviral adherence have insufficiently addressed the challenges of long-term adherence. This longitudinal study examined mental health, substance abuse, and psychosocial predictors of long-term adherence to antiretroviral medications and medical appointments among HIV-seropositive mothers recruited from an infectious disease clinic of a large urban medical center. Individual interviews were conducted at baseline and two follow-up points, 8 to 18 months after enrollment. Based on a model of health behavior, we examined psychiatric and psychosocial predictors of adherence to antiretroviral medications and medical appointments over time. Presence of a psychiatric disorder, negative stressful life events, more household members, and parenting stress were significantly associated with both missed pills and missed medical appointments at follow-up. Baseline substance abuse was associated with missed pills at follow-up and lack of disclosure to family members at baseline was associated with missed medical appointments at follow-up. These findings suggest that interventions that integrate mental health, substance abuse and medical care may be important to improving the medical adherence and health of HIV-seropositive women, particularly in multistressed populations with substantial caregiving and other life demands."
3340,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study is to investigate adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who are homeless or unstably housed. We evaluated homeless or unstably housed PLWHA (n=644) in three US cities were enrolled in the Housing and Health Study. Using baseline data and controlling for gender, race, age, and education, we examined associations between self-reported two- and Seven-day adherence and access to healthcare, mental health, substance use, and attitudes toward HIV medical therapy. Of the 644 participants, 358 (55%) were currently on HAART. For two-day adherence, 280 (78%) reported missing no prescribed doses (100% adherence), and for seven-day adherence, 291 (81%) reported > or =90% adherence. Logistic regression analyses indicated being younger, not having health insurance, and drug use were associated with missing > or =1 dose over the past two days. Scoring lower on SF-36 mental component summary scale and having greater risk of depression (CES-D) and stress (Perceived Stress Scale) were associated with poorer adherence for both two- and seven-day outcomes. Negative attitudes toward HIV treatment were also associated with lower adherence. Adherence to HIV medications in this population is similar to other groups. Coexisting problems of access to healthcare, higher risk of mental health problems, along with poorer attitudes toward treatment are associated with increased likelihood of missing doses. Comprehensive models of HIV care that include a continuum of medical and social services are essential for treating this population."

The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns of precore and core promoter mutations and their relationship to HBeAg expression in Korean patients. Four hundred seventy-five Korean patients with chronic HBV infection between February 1995 and December 2003 were enrolled in this study. There were 236 HBeAg-positive and 239 HBeAg-negative patients. Blood samples were tested for HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe), liver function tests, and serum HBV DNA. Mutations in the precore and core promoter regions were determined by direct sequencing. In the core promoter region, the C1740, C1753, T1762/A1764, and T1766 mutations were associated with HBeAg escape (all; P < 0.05). In the precore region, a higher frequency of the C1802, A1828, T1846, A1850, C1858, T1862, and A1896 mutations was found in HBeAg-negative patients (all; P < 0.05). In particular, the A1896 mutation was associated with high serum levels of ALT and HBV DNA in HBeAg-negative patients (P = 0.014 and 0.026, respectively). Mutations around the Kozak sequence (nucleotides 1809-1812) were found in 6.7% of patients and were not associated with undetectable HBeAg (P = 0.13). In Korean patients, various mutations in the precore and core promoter regions were associated with HBeAg escape and amelioration of hepatic inflammation in HBeAg- negative patients. Only the A1896 mutation contributed to HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B."

(a) uVL group: 15 children with VL below 400 copies/mL; (b) dVL group: 17 children with higher VL. The uVL group showed higher memory (CD4+CD45RO+) T cells than did dVL group, and higher number of memory activated CD4+CD45RO+HLA-DR+ than did control group (healthy age-matched uninfected children), whereas CD4+CD45RA(hi)+CD62L+ was similar. However, TCR rearrangement excision circles (TRECs) were higher in uVL group than in dVL group. uVL Group showed CD8+CD45RO+ and CD8+CD45RO+CD38- higher number than the control group, but lower than the dVL group. The percentage of CD8+CD45RA(hi)+CD62L+, CD8+CD45RA+, CD8+CD62L-, and CD8+CD28+ was higher in uVL group than in dVL group, and lower than in control group. The uVL group showed higher number of activated (HLA-DR+CD38+, HLA-DR+, HLA-DR+CD38-) CD4+ T cells and lower percentages of CD4+HLA-DR-CD38+ than dVL group. In activated CD8- T cell, the uVL group had lower CD8+HLA-DR+CD38+, CD8+HLA-DR+, and CD8+CD38+ than the dVL group. Preeffector (CD8+CD57-CD28- and CD8+CD45RA-CD62L-) T cells were lower in the uVL group than in dVL group. In the effector (CD8+CD57+, CD8+CD57+CD28-, and CD8+CD45RA+CD62L-) T cells, HIV-infected-children had higher values than control group. HIV-infected-children who respond to HAART had TRECs reconstitution, decreased immune activation, and lower effector CD8+ T cells. Moreover, successful HAART allow the increment of activated CD4+ T cells."
8150,0.005,1.0000,"Patients in whom virologic suppression is achieved with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) retain long-lived cellular reservoirs of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1); this retention is an obstacle to sustained control of infection. To assess the impact that initiating treatment during primary HIV-1 infection has on this cell population, we analyzed the decay kinetics of HIV-1 DNA and of infectivity associated with cells activated ex vivo in 27 patients who initiated therapy before or <6 months after seroconversion and in whom viremia was suppressed to <50 copies/mL. The clearance rates of cellular reservoirs could not be distinguished by these techniques (median half-life, 20 weeks) during the first year of HAART. The clearance of HIV-1 DNA slowed significantly during the subsequent 3 years of treatment (median half-life, 70 weeks), consistent with heterogeneous cellular reservoirs being present. Total cell-associated infectivity (CAI) after 1 year of treatment was undetectable (<0.07 infectious units/million cells [IUPM]) in most patients initiating treatment during primary infection either before (9/9) or <6 months after (6/8) seroconversion. In contrast, all 17 control patients who initiated HAART during chronic infection retained detectable CAI after 3-6 years of treatment (median reservoir size, 1.1 IUPM; P<.0005). These results suggest that treatment <6 months after seroconversion may facilitate long-term control of cellular reservoirs that maintain HIV-1 infection during treatment."
6706,0.005,1.0000,"The pathophysiology of insulin resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS) is not fully clarified. We investigated 18 men with HALS and 18 HIV-positive males without lipodystrophy (control subjects). Duration and modality of antiretroviral therapy were similar between study groups. A hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp showed an impaired glucose disposal rate (GDR) in HALS patients (5.6 v 8.3 mg glucose/min. kg(FFM), P =.0006). As demonstrated by indirect calorimetry, HALS patients showed an impaired nonoxidative glucose metabolism (NOGM, 2.2 v 4.2, P =.006), whereas levels of basal and insulin-stimulated oxidative glucose metabolism (OGM) (2.4 v 2.3, P =.55, and 3.3 v 4.0, P =.064, respectively) were not significantly different between groups. Despite comparable total fat masses, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans showed that the percentage of limb fat (ie, peripheral-fat-mass/[peripheral-fat-mass + trunk-fat-mass]. 100%) was reduced in HALS patients (36% v 46%, P =.0002). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that percentage of limb fat explained 53% of the variability of GDR and 45% of the variability of NOGM in HALS patients. In HALS patients, leg fat mass correlated positively with NOGM (r =.51, P <.05), whereas abdominal fat mass and NOGM did not correlate (P =.91). Analyzing the relationship between first phase insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, 6 HALS patients compared with none of the control subjects exhibited impaired insulin secretion (P <.05). Our data suggest that fat redistribution independently of antiretroviral therapy is highly related to insulin resistance in HALS patients. Furthermore, in HALS patients, impaired glucose metabolism most likely relates to decreased NOGM and to defects in beta-cell function."

Eighty-nine patients with cryptococcal meningitis (median age, 34 years; range, 11-63 years; 56 males) were identified from 406 patients for whom a clinical diagnosis of meningitis had been made. All patients tested were positive for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus. Cryptococcal meningitis was the first AIDS-defining illness in 88% of patients. Typical presentations were headache, mental impairment, and meningism (median duration, 14 days; range, 1-180 days). The median CD4+ cell count was 70/microL (range, 0-651/microL). The cumulative median survival from the time of diagnosis was 14 days (range, 0-233 days); 22% of patients survived for >30 days. Independent indicators of a good prognosis were not identified. This study provides a unique basis for the development of novel management strategies for patients with cryptococcal meningitis who reside in resource-poor countries."
3666,0.005,1.0000,"Active TB in HIV-1-infected subjects is associated with increased HIV-1-related immunodeficiency and mortality. We assessed plasma viral load in HIV-1-infected patients with pulmonary TB (HIV/TB) and non-TB symptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (HIV). HIV-1 load was higher in HIV/TB compared with HIV at higher CD4 counts (> 500/microl) (P < 0.01), but not at lower CD4 counts (< 500/microl). We also evaluated the status of HIV-1 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum from HIV/TB and CD4-matched healthy HIV-infected patients (HIV/C) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction over a range of CD4 (> 900/microl to < 200/microl). HIV-1 RNA in serum and PBMC correlated to one another, and both were markedly higher in HIV/TB compared with HIV/C with higher CD4 counts. Also, during a longitudinal study of anti-tuberculous chemoprophylaxis in HIV-1-infected patients, 10 subjects who developed TB had serologies before, at the time, and after the diagnosis of TB. These HIV/TB patients had an increase in viral load (average 2.5-fold) at the time of diagnosis of TB (P < 0.05). Overall, these data indicate that the transcriptional activity of HIV-1 is enhanced in HIV-1-infected patients with active TB, especially during early HIV-1 disease. As TB often is an early HIV-1 opportunistic infection, it may particularly favour early viral replication and dissemination, and therefore contribute to progression of HIV-1 disease."
5829,0.005,1.0000,"To examine intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates and diagnoses of patients with HIV infection, and to determine the outcomes of different critical illnesses, we analyzed data derived from the 63 patients who were admitted to an ICU from among the 1,130 adults with HIV infection who did not have AIDS at the time of enrollment in a multicenter prospective study. Patients were admitted and treated according to the judgment of their physicians. During 4,298 patient-years of follow-up for the entire cohort, there were 1,320 hospital admissions, of which 68 (5%) included admission to an ICU. Twenty-five (40%) of the patients admitted to the ICU died during that admission. Twenty-four patients (38%) were admitted with a principal diagnosis of lung disease; 11 had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), one of whom was coinfected with Aspergillus fumigatus and Legionella pneumophilia, and six of them (55%) died. Four had bacterial pneumonia, two had pulmonary edema caused by renal failure, and one each had pulmonary tuberculosis, pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma, pneumothorax, adult respiratory distress syndrome, severe pulmonary fibrosis, cytomegalovirus pneumonitis, and metastatic adenocarcinoma to the lungs. Eleven of these 14 patients (79%) died. Thirty-nine patients had 44 admissions for nonpulmonary diagnoses, including gastrointestinal disorders (14 admissions), cardiovascular disorders (nine), sepsis syndrome (six), neurologic disorders (four), monitoring and ICU nursing care during or after a procedure (four), metabolic disorders (three), trauma (two), drug overdose (one), and unknown reasons (one). Nine (23%) of these patients died. Twenty-eight patients underwent mechanical ventilation, and 16 (57%) died. Seven (25%) had PCP (five died), seven had other primary pulmonary diseases (six died), and 14 were placed on mechanical ventilation for nonpulmonary disorders (five died). Survival did not correlate with CD4 count determined within 6 mo of admission to the ICU. In conclusion, the range of indications for critical care in patients with HIV infection is diverse. PCP accounted for only 16% of the ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilation for PCP and other pulmonary disorders was associated with a high mortality rate. In contrast, mechanical ventilation for nonpulmonary disorders, and admission to the ICU for nonpulmonary diagnoses was associated with a more favorable outcome."

4229,0.005,1.0000,"Reactivation of hepatitis B is characterized by a sudden increase in hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication in a patient with prior evidence of resolved or inactive HBV infection. Although HBV reactivation can occur spontaneously, it usually occurs after chemotherapy, immunosuppression (organ transplantation) or an alteration in immune function (therapy for autoimmune disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection). The clinical presentation cases can vary, ranging from a subclinical, asymptomatic course to severe acute hepatitis and even death. Although reactivation of HBV is mainly found in HBsAg-positive patients, it can be observed in serologically recovered anti-hepatitis B core antibody (HBc)-positive, HBsAg-negative patients. Serum HBV DNA typically increases during immune suppression, followed by a disease flare and HBV DNA clearance following immune restoration after immune suppression is stopped. In organ transplant recipients, without immune reconstitution, high HBV DNA levels can lead to fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis related to the direct cytopathic effect of HBV. Several randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown that reactivation can be prevented by lamivudine prophylaxis. Screening for HBsAg and anti-HBc should be performed before beginning immunosuppressive treatment and routine prophylaxis is recommended in HBsAg-positive patients. The optimal duration of prophylaxis remains to be determined. In anti-HBc-positive patients with or without anti-hepatitis B surface antigen, alanine transaminase and HBV DNA levels should be closely monitored and antiviral therapy should be started when HBV reactivation is confirmed. The use of new more potent nucleos(t)ides analogues with lower resistance rates would seem to be logical; however, experience with these drugs in the prophylaxis and treatment of severe HBV reactivation is limited."
5500,0.005,1.0000,"Significant decrease in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vertical transmission has been observed worldwide in centers where interventions such as antiretroviral therapy (ART), elective cesarean section, and avoidance of breastfeeding have been implemented. This prospective cohort study aimed to assess the determinants of and the temporal trends in HIV-1 vertical transmission in the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte, Brazil from January 1998 to December 2005. The rate of HIV-1 vertical transmission decreased from 20% in 1998 to 3% in 2005. This decline was associated with increased use of more complex ART regimens during pregnancy. Multivariate analysis restricted to clinical variables demonstrated that non ART, neonatal respiratory distress/sepsis and breastfeeding were independently associated with HIV-1 vertical transmission. When laboratory parameters were included in the model, high maternal viral load and non maternal ART were associated with HIV-1 vertical transmission. The results from this study confirm the impact of ART in the reduction of HIV-1 vertical transmission and indicate the need for improvement in the care and monitoring of mother and infant pairs affected by HIV-1."
4953,0.005,1.0000,"Darunavir boosted by low-dose ritonavir (DRV/r), at a daily dose of 600/100 mg twice a day (bid), has been shown to be superior to alternative highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens for the management of treatment-experienced, HIV-infected adults in the phase IIb POWER trials and the phase III TITAN trial. Economic analyses of different types that have been performed for several countries to investigate the cost effectiveness and budgetary impact of DRV/r 600/100 mg bid for treatment-experienced people living with HIV (PLHIV) based on the clinical data gathered in the POWER and TITAN trials are reviewed for consistency and their value to different decision-makers is assessed. Cost-utility analyses for the USA and several European countries indicate that DRV/r-based HAART is cost effective compared with other standard of care protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens in PLHIV with evidence of PI resistance. For all of these countries, the estimated cost-utility ratio is well below typical benchmark values and these ratios are robust, as demonstrated by one-way sensitivity and variability analyses and multi-way probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Studies using other metrics including the average 1-year drug cost per patient with a plasma HIV-RNA level less than 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks, the incremental drug cost per additional patient with a plasma HIV-RNA level less than 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks, the total (antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral) costs during the first year of treatment, and the total healthcare budget impact during the first 5 years of treatment provided further evidence of the positive economic outcomes with the use of DRV/r in treatment-experienced PLHIV. Different measures of economic outcomes are useful for different types of decision-makers and different types of decisions. In general, the results of these different types of analyses will be consistent with each other. For darunavir, the economic analyses reviewed in this paper demonstrate that the use of DRV/r 600/100 mg bid in the management of HIV-infected, treatment-experienced adults who have failed at least one of the other currently available PIs is cost effective and may be cost saving."
5107,0.005,1.0000,"Cryptosporidium spp. are a major cause of diarrheal disease in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient individuals. They also cause waterborne disease in both the United States and United Kingdom. Studies on the mechanisms of immunity to cryptosporidiosis indicate the importance of the T-cell response. The spectrum and severity of disease in immunocompromised individuals with cryptosporidiosis reflect this importance since the most severe disease is seen in individuals with defects in the T-cell response. The most commonly studied group is that of patients with AIDS. These patients suffer from more severe and prolonged gastrointestinal disease that can be fatal; in addition, body systems other than the gastrointestinal tract may be affected. The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy does appear to be having a beneficial effect on recovery from cryptosporidiosis and on the frequency of infection in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients. Other diseases that are associated with increased risk of severe cryptosporidiosis, such as primary immunodeficiencies, most notably severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, are also predominantly associated with T-cell defects. Of the remaining groups, children with acute leukemia seem to be most at risk from cryptosporidiosis. There is less evidence of severe complications in patients with other malignant diseases or in those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy."
2524,0.005,1.0000,"Aberrant activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) with excessive production of interferon alpha (IFNŒ±) represents one of the hallmarks of immune activation during chronic phase of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A number of studies have shown that disruption of mucosal integrity in the gut is a cause of persistent immune activation. However, little is known about the role that pDCs play in this process, and our current understanding comes from the simian immunodeficiency virus macaque model. Thus, in the present study we sought to investigate the frequency and function of pDCs in peripheral blood and gut samples from HIV-infected individuals before and 6 months after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We show that circulating pDCs were depleted in ART-naive HIV+ patients, and upregulated the gut-homing receptor CD103 compared with uninfected controls. By converse, pDCs accumulated in the terminal ileum of ART-naive HIV individuals compared with controls. Baseline levels of IFNŒ± production and markers of immune activation in gut samples of ART-naive HIV subjects were elevated. All these parameters declined after 6 months of ART. Our results suggest that in chronic HIV infection, pDCs migrate from peripheral blood to the gut-associated lymphatic tissue, where they may contribute to immune activation. "
840,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Both advanced solid tumors and HCV have previously been associated with memory B-cell dysfunction. In this study, we sought to dissect the effect of viral infection, cirrhosis, and liver cancer on memory B-cell frequency and function in the spectrum of HCV disease. Peripheral blood from healthy donors, HCV-infected patients with F1-F2 liver fibrosis, HCV-infected patients with cirrhosis, patients with HCV-related HCC, and non-HCV-infected cirrhotics were assessed for B-cell phenotype by flow cytometry. Isolated B cells were stimulated with anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)40 antibodies and Toll-like receptor (TLR)9 agonist for assessment of costimulation marker expression, cytokine production, immunoglobulin (Ig) production, and CD4(+) T-cell allostimulatory capacity. CD27(+) memory B cells and, more specifically, CD27(+) IgM(+) B cells were markedly less frequent in cirrhotic patients independent of HCV infection. Circulating B cells in cirrhotics were hyporesponsive to CD40/TLR9 activation, as characterized by CD70 up-regulation, tumor necrosis factor beta secretion, IgG production, and T-cell allostimulation. Last, blockade of TLR4 and TLR9 signaling abrogated the activation of healthy donor B cells by cirrhotic plasma, suggesting a role for bacterial translocation in driving B-cell changes in cirrhosis."

This study compares detection rates, genotype distribution and viral loads of different enteric viral agents in HIV-1 seropositive (n = 200) and HIV-1 seronegative (n = 125) children hospitalized with DD in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Except for group A rotavirus (RVA), which were detected through enzyme immunoassay, the other enteric viruses (norovirus [NoV], astrovirus [HAstV], adenovirus [HAdV] and bocavirus [HBoV]) were detected through PCR or RT-PCR. A quantitative PCR was performed for RVA, NoV, HAstV, HAdV and HBoV. Infections with NoV (19% vs. 9.6%; p<0.001), HBoV (14% vs. 7.2%; p = 0.042) and HAdV (30.5% vs. 14.4%; p<0.001) were significantly more frequent among HIV-1 seropositive children. RVA was significantly less frequent among HIV-1 seropositive patients (6.5% vs. 20%; p<0.001). Similarly, frequency of infection with HAstV was lower among HIV-1 seropositive children (5.5% vs. 12.8%; p = 0.018). Among HIV-1 seropositive children 33 (16.5%) had co-infections, including three enteric viruses, such as NoV, HBoV and HAdV (n = 2) and NoV, HAstV and HAdV (n = 2). The frequency of infection with more than one virus was 17 (13.6%) in the HIV-1 negative group, triple infection (NoV + HAstV + HBoV) being observed in only one patient. The median viral load of HAstV in feces was significantly higher among HIV-1 positive children compared to HIV-1 negative children. Concerning children infected with RVA, NoV, HBoV and HAdV, no statistically significant differences were observed in the medians of viral loads in feces, comparing HIV-1 seropositive and HIV-1 seronegative children. Similar detection rates were observed for RVA, HAstV and HAdV, whilst NoV and HBoV were significantly more prevalent among children with CD4+ T lymphocyte count below 200 cells/mm3. Enteric viruses should be considered an important cause of DD in HIV-1 seropositive children, along with pathogens more classically associated with intestinal infections in immunocompromised hosts."
5425,0.005,1.0000,"In the 1990s, HIV has replaced syphilis as the ""great masquerader."" Virtually every level of the neuraxis may be affected in a patient with HIV infection. The superimposition of multiple levels of neuropathology further complicate the bedside neurologic diagnosis of an AIDS patient. This article has reviewed the variety of forms of peripheral neuropathy that may be associated with HIV infection and its treatment. Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy may be produced in patients with HIV infection by neurotoxic drugs (e.g., vincristine, INH, ddC, or ddI) or by vitamin B12 deficiency or may develop in the later stages of HIV infection without identifiable cause. GBS and CIDP occur with increased frequency in early HIV infection owing to presumed autoimmunity, and these IDPs respond to plasmapheresis or prednisone, similar to HIV-seronegative patients. A limited distribution of mononeuropathy simplex or multiplex occurs in patients with CD4 counts greater than 200; the neuropathy will usually spontaneously improve in these patients. Widespread mononeuropathy multiplex may occur in patients with AIDS and CD4 counts less than 50 and is then usually caused by CMV infections; those neuropathies are usually progressive unless antiviral treatment is given. Progressive polyradiculopathy usually occurs in patients with AIDS and low CD4 counts. If the cerebrospinal fluid has a polymorphonuclear pleocytosis, CMV infection is almost always present, and progression is expected unless ganciclovir therapy is promptly started. Finally, mild autonomic neuropathy is commonly present in HIV-infected patients. Protocols for the evaluation and therapy of cranial and peripheral neuropathies are presented (Figs. 6 and 7). It is unfortunate but likely that increasing numbers of ""neuro-AIDS"" patients will be encountered, not only in urban medical centers but also in general community practice. The pace at which research in the field of HIV research has proceeded is unprecedented. It is, therefore, important that neurologists stay at the forefront of investigation and clinical care of these complex disorders."

The human chimeric mice were inoculated with HIV-1(CC1) 3 weeks after the transplantation and sacrificed 2 weeks later. Virus infection was determined by coculture of splenocytes with fresh human PBLs and also by detection of HIV- specific DNA sequences using the polymerase chain reaction. No evidence of infection was observed in mice treated with R-95288 (100 mg/kg/day) using intraperitoneal delivery by osmotic minipumps starting 1 day before virus challenge. In contrast, virus infection was observed in over 80% of the saline-treated control mice. In addition, partial inhibition of HIV-1 infection was obtained in mice treated subcutaneously with R-95288 (100 mg/kg/day). Toxicity towards the engrafted human cells was not observed by flow cytometric analysis. Moreover, R-95288 failed to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation (CC50 > 400 microg/ml), while 90% inhibition of HIV-1 replication was achieved at 3.1 microg/ml in vitro. These results suggest the ability of R-95288 to protect the human chimeric mice against HIV-1 infection."
6453,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the effectiveness of currently available human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) therapies, a continuing need exists for new drugs to treat HIV-1 infection. We investigated the mechanism by which 3-O-[3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl]-betulinic acid (DSB) inhibits HIV-1 replication. DSB functions at a late stage of the virus life cycle but does not inhibit the HIV-1 protease in vitro or interfere with virus assembly or release. DSB specifically delays the cleavage of Gag between the capsid (CA) and p2, resulting in delayed formation of the mature viral core and reduced HIV-1 infectivity. Replication of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) was resistant to DSB; however, a chimeric SIV carrying CA-p2 sequences from HIV-1 was inhibited by the drug, indicating that susceptibility to DSB maps to the CA-p2 region of the HIV-1 Gag protein. A single point mutation at the CA-p2 cleavage site of HIV-1 conferred strong resistance to DSB, confirming the target of the drug. HIV-1 strains that are resistant to a variety of protease inhibitors were sensitive to DSB. These findings indicate that DSB specifically protects the CA-p2 cleavage site from processing by the viral protease during virion maturation, thereby revealing a novel mechanism for pharmacologic inhibition of HIV-1 replication."

Genotyping of the 5'UTR revealed genotypes 1a (n = 10), 1b (n = 13), 2a (n = 3), 2b (n = 4), 2NC (n = 3), 3a (n = 10), and two mixed infections (1a + 1b and 3a + 2). Five of 33 patients showed a change from one HCV genotype to another. The core genotyping assay showed 8 of 45 mixed infections: 6/8 1a + 1b and 2/8 3a + 2. Sequencing of core polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products showed that mixed infection 1a + 1b could be explained by nonspecific annealing of the 1b primer to type 1a sequence. By designing new primers whose sequence was more specific to HCV types 1a and 1b, we could confirm 1a + 1b mixed infection in only one of six cases. Serotyping assay showed for 17 of 21 anti-HIV negative patients a concordance with the 5'UTR genotype; however, only 6 of 19 anti-HIV positive patients showed detectable serological reactivity. In summary, we have observed a similar HCV genotype distribution between our haemophilic group and the French anti-HCV positive patients. The study demonstrates the difficulties of assessing with the presently available genotyping and serotyping assays the real prevalence of mixed infections in multiply transfused patients."

One sample each year from the date of HCV infection to 1994 was analysed for genotype, virus load and nucleotide sequence of the two genetic loci. Both patients were infected with HCV genotype 1 throughout the study period. The virus load profiles were similar except that the profile for the HIV infected patient was displaced 4 years earlier relative to the other patient. Mean divergence of the quasispecies at both the 5'UTR and NS4 loci was higher in the HIV coinfected patient. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that evolution of the 5'UTR was host independent, whereas the NS4 region containing a CD8 restricted CTL epitope evolved in a host specific fashion."

He was found to be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at his health care check in December 2005. After one month, he had an elevated aminotransferase level with hepatitis B e antigen and a high level of serum HBV DNA. He was diagnosed as having acute hepatitis B. On HBV genotype, he had genotype H by the direct sequence method, and he was given a 100 mg of lamivudine daily. However, his acute hepatitis tended to go toward prolonged infection. After two months, he was treated with interferon daily for 28 days. He had negative HBsAg in August 2006. Genotype H, the newest type of hepatitis B, could be the type which shows a poor response to lamivudine.

Seventy-four sequences extending from hypervariable regions V4 through V5 from nine patients yielded a mean intrapatient nucleotide distance of 5.5%, while a mean of 4.2% was observed in 39 sequences of the V3 loop (six patients). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that sequences of six Edinburgh patients were particularly closely related and those from a patient infected in the United States were very distinct. The mean nucleotide distance among these six was 8.3%, while the mean distance from the U.S.-derived sequences was 25.5% in the V4-V5 region. The rate of sequence change across this patient group has been estimated to be 0.4% per year in the V4-V5 region and 0.5% per year in the V3 region, with at least a twofold range across patients.

Despite two stop codons in the precore region characteristic of HBV/G, all patients were positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in serum. When 10 HBV clones were propagated from one patient, and sequenced within precore region and a section of the core gene, 6 clones were HBV/G while 2 were genotype A (HBV/A); a recombination between HBV/G and HBV/A occurred in the remaining 2 clones. Mixed infection of HBV/G and HBV/A, as well as the recombination, was demonstrated in the sequence of preS1 and preS2 regions also. Coinfection with HBV/G and HBV/A was demonstrated in the other three patients, and their recombination in two patients. Ten HBV clones were propagated from one patient at two time points separated by 1 year. Clones of HBV/A, HBV/G and their recombination were found in 9 : 1 : 0 when the patient was positive for HBeAg, while the proportion shifted to 0 : 8 : 2 after the patient seroconverted to anti-HBe. In conclusion, HBV/G is frequently found as a coinfection with HBV/A. This coinfection would explain the presence of HBeAg in individuals infected with HBV/G. Along with seroconversion to anti-HBe, HBV/G would be selected accompanied by the recombination with HBV/A. Further studies should be performed to confirm these findings."

Yet, there is a similar rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) after peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin combination therapy in these patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients and a high hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance rate. The durability of hepatitis C and B clearance in coinfected patients was investigated in a 5-year follow-up study. Patients with active HCV genotype 1, both HBV-coinfected (n = 97) and HBV-monoinfected (n = 110), underwent 48-week combination therapy with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin. In patients with active HCV genotype 2 or 3, both HBV-coinfected (n = 64) and monoinfected (n = 50) patients underwent 24-week combination therapy. A total of 295 (91.9%) patients completed treatment and 24 weeks posttreatment follow-up; 264 (89.5%) patients agreed to receive additional follow-up for up to 5 years after the end of treatment.

This quality improvement project aimed to develop and test a nurse-driven evidence-based pathway that supports the care of patients receiving hepatitis C medication therapy in a tertiary, academic hepatology practice. All adult patients, 18 years and older, who were started on HCV treatment from January 20 to February 15, 2011, were included in the testing of a nurse-driven HCV pathway for the first 12 weeks of treatment. The majority of the patients treated were male (71.8% prepathway and 83.3% postpathway), of White ethnic background (61.5% prepathway and 58.3% postpathway), genotype 1 (69% prepathway and 91.7% postpathway), and had comorbid conditions classified as ""other"" (38.5% prepathway and 33.3% postpathway). As for treatment status, the majority of the patients were ""treatment naive"" in prepathway or had never received prior HCV treatment (59.0%) or ""had recurrent HCV after liver transplantation"" (41.7%).

9325,0.005,1.0000,"The major group of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains that comprise the current global pandemic have diversified during their worldwide spread into at least 10 distinct subtypes, or clades. Subtype C predominates in sub-Saharan Africa and is responsible for the majority of worldwide HIV-1 infections, subtype B predominates in North America and Europe, and subtype E is prevalent in Southeast Asia. Significant amino acid variations have been observed among the clade-specific Tat proteins. For the present study, we examined clade-specific interactions between Tat, transactivation-responsive (TAR) element, and P-TEFb proteins and how these interactions may modulate the efficiency of HIV-1 transcription. Clade-specific Tat proteins significantly modified viral gene expression. Tat proteins derived from HIV-1 clades C and E were strong transactivators of long terminal repeat (LTR) activity; Tat E also had a longer half-life than the other Tat proteins and interacted more efficiently with the stem-loop TAR element. Chimeric Tat proteins harboring the Tat E activation domain were strong transactivators of LTR expression. While Tat B, C, and E were able to rescue a Tat-defective HIV-1 proviral clone, Tat E was significantly more efficient at rescue than Tat C, possibly due to the relative stability of the Tat protein. Swapping the activation domains of Tat B, C, and E identified the cyclin T1 association domain as a critical determinant of the transactivation efficiency and of Tat-defective HIV-1 provirus rescue."
258,0.005,1.0000,"Several members of the seven-transmembrane chemokine receptor family have been shown to serve, with CD4, as coreceptors for entry by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). While coreceptor usage by HIV-1 primary isolates has been studied by several groups, there is only limited information available concerning coreceptor usage by primary HIV-2 isolates. In this study, we have analyzed coreceptor usage of 15 primary HIV-2 isolates, using lymphocytes from a donor with nonfunctional CCR5 (CCR5 -/-; homozygous 32-bp deletion). Based on the infections of PBMCs, seven of these primary isolates had an absolute requirement for CCR5 expression, whereas the remaining eight exhibited a broader coreceptor usage. All CCR5-requiring isolates were non-syncytium inducing, whereas isolates utilizing multiple coreceptors were syncytium inducing. Blocking experiments using known ligands for chemokine receptors provided indirect evidence for additional coreceptor utilization by primary HIV-2 isolates. Analysis of GHOST4 cell lines expressing various chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR4, BONZO, and BOB) further defined specific coreceptor usage of primary HIV-2 isolates. The receptors used included CXCR4, CCR1-5, and the recently described receptors BONZO and BOB. However, the efficiency at which the coreceptors were utilized varied greatly among the various isolates. Analysis of V3 envelope sequences revealed no specific motif that correlated with coreceptor usage. Our data demonstrate that primary HIV-2 isolates are capable of using a broad range of coreceptors for productive infection in vitro. Additionally, our data suggest that expanded coreceptor usage by HIV-2 may correlate with disease progression."
3442,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates can be distinguished by their chemokine coreceptor usage. Non-syncytium-inducing (NSI), macrophage-tropic viruses utilize CCR5 and are called R5 viruses; syncytium-inducing (SI) isolates use CXCR4 and are known as X4 viruses. R5 and X4 HIV isolates are both transmitted but, in most cases, R5 viruses predominate in the blood prior to the development of AIDS-related pathogenesis. The reason for the selective growth of the R5 strain is not known, but could reflect a replication advantage of R5 viruses over X4 viruses in CD4+ cells. To explore this possibility, eight phenotypically distinct viruses were used to infect CD4+ cells and cellular proliferation and activation were evaluated. In unstimulated CD4+ cells, R5 virus isolates increased the level of cell activation compared with X4 virus isolates and uninfected control cells. In CD4+ cells that were stimulated with interleukin 2, both R5 and X4 viruses were found to decrease the level of cell proliferation and reduce the majority of the activation markers studied when compared with uninfected control CD4+ cells from the same donors. However, although equal amounts of CD4+ cells were infected, R5 virus-infected CD4+ cells showed a two- to fourfold increase in cellular proliferation over X4 viruses, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation (P=0.001) and nuclear expression of Ki67 (P=0.001). In addition, a larger proportion of CD4+ T cells infected with R5 viruses had significantly higher levels of activation-marker expression (e.g. CD25, CD71 and HLA-DR) than CD4+ T lymphocytes infected with X4 viruses (P<0.02). Taken together, these results indicate that CD4+ cells infected with R5 virus isolates may have a selective advantage over X4 virus-infected CD4+ T cells for survival and, hence, virus spread."

CXCR-4 (fusin) was the first identified, and it serves as co-receptor for T-cell-line tropic (T-tropic) HIV-1 isolates. To determine the expression of CXCR-4 in the brain, a major target of HIV pathology, we used immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction with CXCR-4-specific antibodies and probes. We found that CXCR-4 was expressed in several cell types in brain, but notably in neurons and microglia, a finding that was replicated in tissue culture. The study of the expression of CXCR-4 in the brain, which may be one of many chemokine receptors in the central nervous system, may provide further insight into the interactions between brain cells, pathogens, and the immune system, and help understand the pathogenesis of HIV dementia."

Cells from infected gibbon apes demonstrated a group-specific response toward whole virus preparations from three divergent HIV-1 isolates (HTLV-IIIB, HTLV-IIIRF, HTLV-IIIMN). Consistent responses were also detected against purified HIV-1 Ag, i.e., native gp120 envelope glycoprotein, recombinant gp160 glycoprotein, a synthetic peptide (peptide 7) representing a highly conserved region of gp120, and purified native core protein p24. In addition, lymphocytes from infected gibbon apes displayed a specific, MHC-restricted, cytotoxic activity against autologous cells expressing HIV-1 envelope or gag proteins. The specific T cell reactivity toward HIV-1 proteins observed in infected gibbons contrasts with findings in HIV-1 infected humans, and may help to explain the apparent discrepancy in the natural history of the infection between the two species."

Cystamine suppressed HIV-1 expression in CBMDM and lymphocytes in a concentration-dependent fashion as determined by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. This inhibitory effect of cystamine occurred with all five HIV-1 strains (both laboratory adopted and fresh isolates) tested in the study. The addition of cystamine to cultures of HIV-1 chronically infected CBMDM also suppressed 80% to 90% of RT activity in comparison with untreated controls. Cystamine also decreased HIV-1 protein expression in CBMDM as determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay. The inhibitory effects of cystamine on HIV-1 did not appear to be caused by toxicity to CBMDM or lymphocytes because there was no change in cell viability or cellular DNA synthesis as evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion and [3H]-thymidine incorporation at doses of cystamine that inhibit the virus. HIV-1 infected CBMDM or lymphocyte cultures (without cystamine treatment) demonstrated giant syncytium formation or cytopathic effect (CPE), respectively, whereas cystamine-treated cultures lacked the giant syncytia or CPE induced by HIV-1 infection. Thus, these observations indicate that cystamine may have the potential to limit HIV-1 replication in monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes in vivo and may represent a potentially useful compound in the treatment of pediatric HIV-1 infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."
8686,0.005,1.0000,"Isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) derived from the central nervous system (CNS) display properties distinctive from blood-derived isolates, including a high incidence of macrophage tropism in CNS isolates. Macrophage tropism is a result, in part, of DNA sequence variation in the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gene, but evidence also exists suggesting differences in the long terminal repeat (LTR) may contribute to differential gene expression. To investigate the nature of HIV-1 LTR sequence variation in the brain, we have sequenced bases -374 to +43 of the LTR from the brains of four HIV-1-infected patients. A total of 56 clones were derived from either both gray and white matter (three brains) or white matter alone (one brain), and these sequences were compared to 17 published sequences derived from multiple sources. A total of five LTR quasispecies were found. Overall, there was a significant amount of sequence variation both within and between brains, comparable to that seen in quasispecies of the envelope glycoprotein derived from blood or brain. The vast majority of the variation was seen in regions upstream from the two NF-kappa B sites. Compared to the blood-derived, T cell-tropic IIIB LTR, a majority of clones from two or more of the brains shared 11 unique substitutions in transcription factor binding sites, of which eight were shared with the CNS-derived clones JR-CSF and JR-FL and altered the NF-AT and LEF-1 transcription factor binding sites. These findings correlate with published functional studies showing CNS-derived HIV-1 LTRs are distinct from the blood-derived IIIB LTR, and represent a starting point for future studies designed to determine which LTR sequence variations are associated with cell-specific differences in gene expression in the CNS."
7565,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most dangerous malignancies with an increasing incidence and a high mortality rate, represents a major international health problem. HCC progression is known to involve genome-wide alteration of epigenetic modifications, leading to aberrant gene expression patterns. The activity of CYP2C19, an important member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, was reported to be compromised in HCC, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To understand whether epigenetic modification in HCC is associated with a change in CYP2C19 activity, we evaluated the expression levels of CYP2C19 and its transcription factors by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using mRNA extracted from both primary hepatocytes and paired tumor versus nontumor liver tissues of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). DNA methylation was examined by bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Our results indicated that CYP2C19 could be regulated by e-box methylation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Decreased CYP2C19 expression in tumorous tissues of HBV-infected patients with HCC was highly correlated with suppressed expression and promoter hypermethylation of CAR. Our study demonstrates that aberrant CAR methylation is involved in CYP2C19 regulation in HBV-related HCC and may play a role in liver tumorigenesis."
7673,0.005,1.0000,"The development of AIDS in HIV-1-infected humans is associated with profound changes in the expression patterns of lymphocyte phenotypic markers associated with increased immune activation and with decreased recall immune responses. In assessing these immunologic changes in an animal model, we characterized the expression patterns of immune activation markers on lymphocyte subsets during the acute, chronic, and end stages of HIV-2 infection in baboons. Using flow cytometry, we identified 21 human-specific monoclonal antibodies that were cross-reactive with baboon lymphocytes; however, expression of only 2 of these markers was altered significantly after HIV-2 infection. We found an increase in baboon class II antigen (as measured by anti-HLA-DR) in the CD4(+) T cell subset within 8 weeks of infection (p = 0.045). Moreover, after 1 year of infection, CD11b was downregulated on CD8(+) T lymphocytes (p = 0.027). This downregulation of CD11b was consistently observed in all of the groups of baboons that were chronically infected with three different HIV-2 isolates. In addition, we found substantial downregulation of the interleukin 2 receptor (CD25) and upregulation of class II antigen on CD8(+) lymphocytes in a baboon with an AIDS-like disease. These and other phenotypic markers of immune activation may facilitate characterization of the immunopathogenesis of AIDS in nonhuman primate animal models."
8796,0.005,1.0000,"Notch1 plays an important role in the regulation of immune responses and epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT). Previous studies have observed inflammatory cell infiltration and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the renal biopsies from patients with HBV-associated glomerulonephritis (HBV-GN). We hypothesized that Notch1 may be involved in the progression of HBV-GN. In this study, we evaluated the distribution of Notch1 in patients with HBV-GN. Our results showed that Notch1 was mainly distributed in renal tubules and the interstitial area, and the expression levels of Notch1 had a positive correlation with the renal tubular pathology. In this respect, we used human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) as target cells, which were transiently transfected with the hepatitis B virus X (HBx) gene using a eukaryotic vector. HBx expression resulted in significantly increased detection of Notch1, alpha-smooth muscle actin (Œ±-SMA), major histocompatibility complex-II (MHC-II), CD40 and interleukin-4 (IL-4). At the same time, E-cadherin and interferon-Œ≥ (IFN-Œ≥) expression levels were significantly inhibited. These HBx-induced phenotypes were exacerbated by upregulation of Notch1. Knock-down of Notch1 by specific shRNA caused decreases of Œ±-SMA, MHC-II, CD40 and IL-4, and increases of E-cadherin and IFN-Œ≥. These findings suggest that Notch1 is significantly associated with renal tubular and interstitial lesions. Notch1 can mediate HBx-induced EMT of HK-2 cells, promote HBx-induced increases in immune molecule expression and exacerbation of cytokine disorders, which may contribute to the progression of HBV-GN. Inhibitors of Notch1 signalling may be useful as new therapeutics for the treatment of HBV-GN."
9059,0.005,1.0000,"To enhance immunity induced by DNA vaccination against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), we evaluated the efficacy of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), an adjuvant of bacterial origin. BALB/c mice were intramuscularly injected with immunogenic DNA, encoding the env and rev genes of the HIV-1(IIIB) strain, formulated with MPL dissolved in different vehicles (MPL in stable emulsion and MPL in aqueous formulation). The sera from mice immunized with the two preparations of MPL revealed 2(6) to 2(9) times higher HIV-1-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers than the sera from mice immunized without MPL. In virus neutralization tests for HIV-1(IIIB), by p24 assay and antifusion assay of infected MOLT-4 cells, MPL tends to elicit antibody more protective than antibody elicited without adjuvant. MPL also elicited stronger delayed-type hypersensitivity and cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte activity against HIV-1(IIIB) compared to DNA alone. HIV-1-specific IgG subclass analysis showed that MPL tends to facilitate IgG2a production, suggesting enhancement of a predominant T-helper-type-1 response, and this enhancement may help to facilitate protective-antibody induction. Furthermore, a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay was employed to determine whether MPL affected the gene expression process. Interestingly, both MPL preparations reduced CAT activity in the muscle injected with CAT expression vector but increased anti-CAT antibody production. These results indicate that MPL acts as an effective adjuvant for immunogenic DNA injection despite reduced expression of encoding protein in muscle. We conclude that MPL has a strong adjuvant effect on DNA vaccination against HIV-1."
3194,0.005,1.0000,"Two hundred and two homosexual men enrolled in a prospective cohort study of AIDS risk were assessed for differences in the occurrence and progression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection with respect to cigarette smoking. Among subjects who were initially seronegative, smokers were more likely than nonsmokers to become HIV-1 seropositive (p = 0.03). After seroconversion, serum beta 2-microglobulin and CD4+ lymphocyte levels were elevated in cigarette smokers relative to nonsmokers (p = 0.02 for both comparisons), but both of these differences disappeared within 2 years. There was no detectable difference in the risk of AIDS or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with respect to smoking. Our data suggest that cigarette smoking may alter the immune response to HIV-1 infection, but it appears to have no marked effect on clinical outcome. They also suggest that cigarette smoking may be a surrogate marker for continued high-risk sexual behavior in homosexual men."
9032,0.005,1.0000,"The humoral immune response of the human host against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins comprises virus-neutralizing antibodies (NAs), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediating (ADCC) antibodies, and infection-enhancing antibodies (IEAs). Because of their potential significance for the outcome of infection with this virus, we have studied the relative prevalence of NAs, ADCC antibodies, and IEAs in the sera of patients infected with HIV. Our results demonstrate that while >or=60% of serum samples are positive for NAs or ADCC antibodies, 72% of these serum samples mediate the enhancement of infection in the presence of complement. In patients with low CD4 counts, NA and ADCC antibody levels tend to decrease, while IEA levels increase. A significant positive correlation was found only between the presence of ADCC antibodies and the presence of antibodies that neutralized HIV-1 in the presence of complement. These results show that the anti-HIV-1 humoral immune response consists of a mixture of antibodies that may inhibit or enhance HIV infection and whose ratios may vary in different stages of the infection."
8310,0.005,1.0000,"Polymorphism in the HLA region of a chromosome is the major source of host genetic variability in HIV-1 outcome, but there is limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of protective class I alleles such as HLA-B57, -B27, and -B51. Taking advantage of a unique cohort infected with clade B' HIV-1 through contaminated blood, in which many variables such as the length of infection, the infecting viral strain, and host genetic background are controlled, we performed a comprehensive study to understand HLA-B51-associated HIV-1 control. We focused on the T cell responses against three dominant HLA-B51-restricted epitopes: Gag327-345(NI9) NANPDCKTI, Pol743-751(LI9) LPPVVAKEI, and Pol283-289(TI8) TAFTIPSI. Mutations in all three dominant epitopes were significantly associated with HLA-B51 in the cohort. A clear hierarchy in selection of epitope mutations was observed through epitope sequencing. L743I in position 1 of epitope LI9 was seen in most B51(+) individuals, followed by V289X in position 8 of the TI8, and then, A328S, in position 2 of the NI9 epitope, was also seen in some B51(+) individuals. Good control of viral load and higher CD4(+) counts were significantly associated with at least one detectable T cell response to unmutated epitopes, whereas lower CD4(+) counts and higher viral loads were observed in patients who had developed escape mutations in all three epitopes or who lacked T cell responses specific to these epitope(s). We propose that patients with HLA-B51 benefit from having multiple layers of effective defense against the development of immune escape mutations."
3031,0.005,1.0000,"Anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) therapy leads to the emergence of mutant viral strains during the treatment of chronic hepatitis B with nucleos(t)ides analogues. The existence of HBV variants with primary antiviral resistance may be important for treatment choice. We studied two patients with chronic HBV infection by sequencing the HBV polymerase gene. They had adefovir- and tenofovir-related mutations in the viral polymerase, although they had never been treated. These mutations were rtV214A/rtN238T in one patient and rtA194T in the other. Thus, mutations in untreated patients deserve cautious surveillance. These data indicate that mutations that can theoretically confer adefovir or tenofovir resistance may emerge in treatment-naive patients."
996,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B continues to be a global problem, with an estimated 240 million cases according to the World Health Organization. Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are currently several US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for treating chronic hepatitis B, with Lamivudine (LAM) being the first oral agent made available. The major problem with LAM is significantly decreased effectiveness over time due to the development of anti-HBV resistance that can lead to virologic and biochemical breakthrough as well as hepatitis B flare, progression of liver disease, and decompensation of pre-existing cirrhosis. Despite its high anti-HBV resistant rate, LAM remains widely used in underdeveloped countries due to its wide availability and low cost compared to other antiviral medications, including those that are more effective. Therefore, it is still clinically important to learn how to prevent and treat LAM resistant strains of HBV. Several regimens with the other available antiviral agents have been studied, including switching to monotherapy with either Adefovir, Entecavir, or Tenofovir, adding Adefovir to LAM, and switching to a combination of Adefovir and Entecavir. This review article will examine molecular mechanisms and diagnosis of LAM anti-HBV resistance, risks for and approaches to reduce LAM anti-HBV resistance, and currently available rescue therapy regimens for LAM resistance.

6910,0.005,1.0000,"HBeAg seropositivity is a marker for active viral replication. In the natural history of chronic hepatitis B infection, HBeAg marks the first two of the four phases, namely the immune tolerant phase and the immune clearance phase, and is associated with highly replicative activity of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Most HBV consensus reports and guidelines recommend antiviral therapy if the immune clearance phase is prolonged and if there is evidence of significant necroinflammation and fibrosis. Two main types of antiviral agents have been approved for treating patients in the immune clearance phase: interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs). The endpoints of therapy are viral suppression with HBeAg seroconversion, undetectable serum HBV DNA, normalization of serum alanine transaminase and improvement in the histological necroinflammatory and fibrosis scores. The ultimate goal of therapy is to obtain clinical benefit for the patient by reducing complications including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The choice between interferon-based immune modulators or NUCs that target the HBV DNA polymerase must be carefully weighed on an individual basis. Therapy with NUCs is often preferred by doctors and patients because it is easy to administer, with predictable efficacy and minimal side-effects. In specific patient subgroups such as those with decompensated disease, poor predictors of response or lack of response to interferon-based therapy and/or significant comorbidities that cannot tolerate interferon-induced side effects, NUCs therapy is the obvious choice. Entecavir and tenofovir are the treatments of choice because their efficacy and safety profile are better than lamivudine, adefovir and telbivudine. More importantly, there is a minimal risk of drug resistance during long-term therapy with these agents."
5841,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) continues to be an important public health problem worldwide, including in the United States. An algorithm for managing CHB was developed by a panel of United States hepatologists in 2004 and subsequently updated in 2006 and 2008. Since 2008, additional data on long-term safety and efficacy of licensed therapies have become available and have better defined therapeutic options for CHB. The evidence indicates that potent antiviral therapy can lead to regression of extensive fibrosis or even cirrhosis, thus potentially altering the natural history of CHB. In addition, appropriate choice of antiviral agent can minimize the risk of resistance. This updated algorithm for managing CHB is based primarily on evidence from the scientific literature. Where data were lacking, the panel relied on clinical experience and consensus expert opinion. The primary aim of antiviral therapy for CHB is durable suppression of serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA to low or undetectable levels. CHB patients who have HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL, elevated alanine aminotransferase level, and any degree of fibrosis should receive antiviral therapy regardless of their hepatitis B e antigen status. CHB patients with HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL and elevated alanine aminotransferase level but no evidence of fibrosis may also be considered for antiviral therapy. Approved antiviral therapies for CHB are interferon alfa-2b, peginterferon alfa-2a, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir, although the preferred first-line treatment choices are peginterferon alfa-2a, entecavir, and tenofovir. In determining choice of therapy, considerations include efficacy, safety, rate of resistance, method of administration, duration, and cost. "

7144,0.005,1.0000,"This article summarizes the current state of antiviral therapy of hepatitis B with special attention given to areas that remain controversial or poorly defined. Strict adherence to liver association practice guidelines may result in missed opportunities to treat patients with significant underlying liver disease. In particular, recommended ALT thresholds may not appropriately reflect disease activity or degree of fibrosis. There is growing evidence that an alternative treatment paradigm for preventing late-stage disease complications may be indicated in highly viremic patients with early life exposure to hepatitis B. Pegylated interferon therapy is often a better choice for young to middle-aged patients with genotype A and B because of the higher rate of HBeAg seroconversion and a greater chance for HBsAg seroconversion in both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients as compared to nucleoside analogs. Nucleoside analog monotherapy is the current standard of care for many patients. However, long-term monotherapy results in resistance to a variable degree and sequential monotherapy may result in multi-drug resistant virus. Which patients would specifically benefit from early combination therapy also remains poorly defined. The rapidity and robustness of the suppression of HBV DNA while on a nucleoside analog should be monitored relatively early during treatment because it affects treatment outcome and the rate of resistance. While great progress has been made in treating hepatitis B, many important issues require further study."
6067,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with adverse liver outcomes. The clinical impact of previous HBV infection on liver disease in HCV infection is unknown. We aimed at determining any association of previous HBV infection with liver outcomes using antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb) positivity as a marker of exposure. The Scottish Hepatitis C Clinical Database containing data for all patients attending HCV clinics in participating health boards was linked to the HBV diagnostic registry and mortality data from Information Services Division, Scotland. Survival analyses with competing risks were constructed for time from the first appointment to decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related mortality. Records of 8513 chronic HCV patients were included in the analyses (87 HBcAb positive and HBV surface antigen [HBsAg] positive, 1577 HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative, and 6849 HBcAb negative). Multivariate cause-specific proportional hazards models showed previous HBV infection (HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative) significantly increased the risks of decompensated cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01-1.65) and HCC (HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.09-2.49), but not liver-related death (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.80-1.30). This is the largest study to date showing an association between previous HBV infection and certain adverse liver outcomes in HCV infection. Our analyses add significantly to evidence which suggests that HBV infection adversely affects liver health despite apparent clearance. This has important implications for HBV vaccination policy and indications for prioritization of HCV therapy."
7681,0.005,1.0000,"Lamivudine (LAM) resistance now poses a major problem in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We retrospectively collected clinical data on chronic HBV-infected patients who had developed LAM resistance under de novo LAM monotherapy and subsequently took nucleos(t)ide analogs as rescue strategy in our hospital. From initiation of rescue therapies to January 2012, incidence of antiviral drug resistance was 23.67%, 18%, 6.94% and 0% (P=0.007) in the group of switching to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) monotherapy, switching to entecavir (ETV) monotherapy, adding on ADV and switching to combination of ADV and ETV. At month 12, the median levels of serum HBV DNA were respectively 9300IU/mL, 4648IU/mL, 2054IU/mL and 100IU/mL (P<0.001), and the cumulative rates of serum ALT normalization were respectively 75%, 84%, 93% and 100% (P=0.003). Additionally, the strategy of switching to ADV monotherapy induced more single rtA181T mutations. In conclusion, switching to ADV monotherapy has been widely used in real-world clinical practice in China, however, due to the high incidence of drug resistance, switching to neither ADV nor ETV monotherapy is optimal when LAM resistance occurs; combination of ADV and ETV is most effective, whereas the strategy of adding on ADV is rational for most of LAM-resistant Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B."

Clinical studies have been performed to determine the efficacy of different specimens and diagnostic systems for the provision of clinically useful information. Our approach has been to provide medical care on an outpatient basis using less invasive diagnostic systems that do not require direct physician participation. Direct laboratory examination of a single specimen submitted to microbiology often yielded presumptive or final diagnoses that were directly communicated to the physician. The evolution of PCP diagnosis in AIDS patients is described. Our current procedure of examining mucolysed, concentrated induced sputum stained with a rapid Giemsatype stain, Diff-Quik (Baxter/Scientific Products, McGaw, IL), has a sensitivity for P carinii detection of 74% to 77%. We have found that the use of commercially available immunofluorescence staining diminishes screening time and increases the sensitivity of P carinii detection in mucolysed concentrated induced sputum. We also describe the appearance of bacterial, fungal, and parasitic agents seen on direct examination and the usefulness of antigen detection, serology, and various microbiologic culture systems for diagnosing infections caused by these organisms."

2810,0.005,1.0000,"Several reports show that the prevalence of HBV (hepatitis B virus) carriers in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infected populations is significantly higher than in HIV seronegative individuals, independent of the risk group for HIV, that is, homosexuals or drug abusers. In this context, evaluation of the simultaneous presence of HBV and HIV in PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) is of particular interest for at least 2 reasons: 1) the possible reciprocal influence of the 2 viruses when they infect the same cell; 2) the possibility that HIV-induced hematological disorders could indirectly influence the settling of HBV in blood cell populations. We report data on the frequency of PCR positivity for HBV DNA in PBMCs from 62 HIV infected patients, rigorously selected by risk group, that is, intravenous use of heroin for at least 3 years and syringe promiscuity. Sixty-seven HIV negative individuals who never used any drug formed the control group. The analysis of the cases positive for HBV DNA in PBMCs showed that: 1) the overall prevalence of PCR positivity found in HIV infected patients was significantly lower than that registered in the control group; 2) PCR positivity among the subjects who were HBsAg negative and anti-HBV positive was extremely low in the HIV infected patients (3.7%) but quite frequent in the HIV negative subjects (37.0%). The results support the hypothesis that, unlike the HIV negative individuals, our HIV infected patients exhibited HBV DNA in PBMCS almost exclusively when they presented with active HBV replication."

In order to describe the prevalence of HBV and HCV infection, and to determine HCV genotypes in the population, serum samples were collected from 107 intravenous drug users during 2005-2006. Fifty-seven percent (n = 61) were HCV RNA positive and 51% (n = 55) were HBV DNA positive. Co-infection of HBV and HCV were found in 23% (n = 25).

Moreover, mixed infections of genotypes 1b and 2a/2c were found in 5% (n = 3). When the number of patients with HCV genotype 1b compared with that of patients with genotype 2a/2c, HBV DNA titer was not significantly different by independent t-test (t = -0.881, P = 0.392 > 0.05) between the two patient groups. These results suggest that the prevalence of HBV and HCV infection among intravenous drug users is high showing over 50% in Korea and a strategic prevention program should be performed in this group to prevent further infection into local community."

The HIV-1 env subtypes were determined for 141 samples, of which 40 were from female patients and 101 were from male patients; 13 samples were from children. Forty-seven patients were infected by homosexual or bisexual contact, 46 were infected through heterosexual contact, 21 were infected from injecting drug use (IDU), 13 were infected by vertical transmission, 8 were infected from nosocomial exposure, and 6 were infected by other modes of transmission, including exposure to blood products, ritualistic practices, and two cases of intrafamilial transmission. Five subtypes were detected; B (n = 104), A (n = 5), C (n = 17), E (CRF01_AE; n = 13), and G (n = 2). Subtype B predominated in HIV-1 acquired homosexually (94% of cases) and by IDU (100%), whereas non-subtype B infections were mostly seen in heterosexually (57%) or vertically (22%) acquired HIV-1 infections and were usually imported from Africa and Asia. Subtype B strains of group M viruses predominate in Australia in HIV-1 transmitted by homosexual or bisexual contact and IDU.

Genotyping targeted 225 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the exons, 5' untranslated region (UTR) and 3' UTR sequences of 27 immune-related candidate genes encoding interleukin family of cytokines. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the association of type-specific HPV clearance adjusting for time-varying CD4+ T-cell count and low-risk (LR-HPV) HPV co-infections. HR-HPV clearance rates were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with five SNPs (rs228942, rs419598, rs315950, rs7737000, and rs9292618) mapped to coding and regulatory regions in three genes (IL2RB, IL1RN, and IL7R).

7608,0.005,1.0000,"The fourth conserved region (C4) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) surface glycoprotein has been shown to participate in CD4 binding and to influence viral tropism (A. Cordonnier, L. Montagnier, and M. Emerman, Nature [London] 340:571-574, 1989). To define the role of the corresponding region of HIV-2, we introduce single amino acid changes into the C4 sequence of HIV-2ROD. The effects of these mutations on glycoprotein function and on virus infectivity have been examined. We have shown that the tryptophan residue at position 428 is necessary primarily for CD4 binding. The isoleucine residue at position 421 is necessary for the establishment of productive infection in the promonocytic cell line U937, while it is dispensable to some extent for infection of primary T lymphocytes or the lymphocytic cell line SUP-T1. This replication defect correlated with the failure of the Ile-421-to-Thr (Ile-421-->Thr) mutant glycoprotein to form syncytia in U937 cells. DNA analysis of revertant viruses revealed that a strong selective pressure was exerted on residue 421 of the surface glycoprotein to allow HIV-2 infection of U937 cells. These results demonstrate that this region of HIV-2 plays an important role in determining fusion efficiency in a cell-dependent manner and consequently can influence viral tropism."

The objective of this study was to estimate the burden of liver disease and evaluate determinants of liver fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity among HIV/HCV coinfected patients receiving ART. We studied 112 randomly selected and 98 referred HCV-infected patients undergoing care in the Johns Hopkins University HIV clinic. Liver disease was characterized clinically and histologically. Of the 210 individuals studied--64% of whom had received ART within 2 years of liver disease assessment--33% had no fibrosis (F0), and 26% had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (> or =F3). The median necroinflammatory activity score was 3 (range, 0-9 of 18). ART was not associated with fibrosis; however, significantly less hepatic necroinflammatory activity was observed among persons who had received highly active antiretroviral therapy longer (P = .02) and more effectively (defined by HIV RNA suppression; P < .01). Twelve percent of individuals had previous ART-associated liver enzyme elevations (grades 3-4), but liver fibrosis was not more severe if the liver enzyme elevation resolved. On the other hand, liver fibrosis was more severe in persons with persistent liver enzyme elevations (grades 1-4). In conclusion, despite widespread exposure to ART and documented instances of ART-related hepatitis, we found no evidence that ART caused serious histological liver disease. Recognition of bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis in some but not most patients underscores the importance of identifying and treating liver disease in HIV/HCV coinfected persons."
4636,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading cause of liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) play an important role in the regulation of immune response against infectious organisms, including HBV. Recently, several genome-wide association (GWAS) studies have shown that genetic variations in HLA genes influence disease progression in HBV infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of HLA genetic polymorphisms and their possible role in HBV infection in Saudi Arabian patients. Variations in HLA genes were screened in 1672 subjects who were divided according to their clinical status into six categories as follows; clearance group, inactive carriers, active carriers, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and uninfected healthy controls. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belonged to HLA-DQ region (rs2856718, rs7453920 and rs9275572) and two SNPs belonged to HLA-DP (rs3077 and rs9277535) were studied. The SNPs were genotyped by PCR-based DNA sequencing (rs2856718) and allele specific TaqMan genotyping assays (rs3077, rs7453920, rs9277535 and rs9275572). The results showed that rs2856718, rs3077, rs9277535 and rs9275572 were associated with HBV infection (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.0003, OR‚Ää=‚Ää1.351, CI‚Ää=‚Ää1.147-1.591; p‚Ää=‚Ää0.041, OR‚Ää=‚Ää1.20, CI‚Ää=‚Ää1.007-1.43; p‚Ää=‚Ää0.045, OR‚Ää=‚Ää1.198, CI‚Ää=‚Ää1.004-1.43 and p‚Ää=‚Ää0.0018, OR‚Ää=‚Ää0.776, CI‚Ää=‚Ää0.662-0.910, respectively). However, allele frequency of rs2856718, rs7453920 and rs9275572 were found more in chronically infected patients when compared to clearance group infection (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.0001, OR‚Ää=‚Ää1.462, CI‚Ää=‚Ää1.204-1.776; p‚Ää=‚Ää0.0178, OR‚Ää=‚Ää1.267, CI‚Ää=‚Ää1.042-1.540 and p‚Ää=‚Ää0.010, OR‚Ää=‚Ää0.776, CI‚Ää=‚Ää0.639-0.942, respectively). No association was found when polymorphisms in HLA genes were compared in active carriers versus cirrhosis/HCC patients. In conclusion, these results suggest that variations in HLA genes could affect susceptibility to and clearance of HBV infection in Saudi Arabian patients. "
9387,0.005,1.0000,"Measurement of quality of life is crucial to assess the full impact of antiretroviral therapy on patient morbidity. No quality of life instruments have been validated in an Asian HIV-infected patient population, but it is important to do so given the increasing involvement of the region in clinical trials. We set out to validate the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) in HIV infected patients in Singapore. Clinically stable outpatients were asked to complete the 30-item MOS-HIV (English or Chinese translation). Patients were also asked about the frequency of selected disease symptoms, and clinical and demographic data were recorded from the case sheet. 163 patients (90% Chinese, 96% male, mean age 38 years, mean CD4 count 159 cells/mm(3)) participated in the study and completed the questionnaire to a satisfactory standard. The questionnaire showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >0.7 in all cases). There were significant differences in quality of life scores between Centers for Disease Control disease stages, and significant correlations with CD4 count and symptom score, confirming the discriminant validity of the MOS-HIV. Factor analysis revealed two components corresponding to physical and mental health which were similar to those of studies in Western countries except that pain was more closely related to mental than physical health. Linear regression analysis identified symptom burden as the major predictor of physical and mental health. We concluded that the MOS-HIV is a valid measure of quality of life in this HIV patient population in Singapore, and is therefore likely to be useful in future clinical trials in the region. In the era of chronic HIV disease, close attention to symptoms (disease or drug-related) is warranted due to their major adverse influence on mental and physical aspects of quality of life."
4605,0.005,1.0000,"The role of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) during virus rebound in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy is poorly understood. Three patients in this study had NAbs to preexisting autologous HIV-1 and an episode of virus rebound after a prolonged period of virus suppression. To investigate the influence of NAbs on virus evolution, envelope genotypes of preexisting and rebound viruses were examined. Phylogenetic analysis of env (V1-V5) sequences indicated that rebound viruses had evolved from or preexisted in baseline populations. By use of envelope pseudotype viruses, rebound viruses were found to be significantly resistant to neutralization by autologous antibody in all 3 patients, indicating that rebound viruses were selected by NAbs. The site responsible for conferring neutralization resistance against autologous antibody was identified in the upstream C3 region in 2 of 3 patients."
2818,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatic steatosis is an emerging cause of morbidity in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced HIV patients. The influence of steatosis on fibrosis is poorly understood. We report two cases of rapid evolution of disseminated macrovacuolar steatofibrosis to cirrhosis. Both patients had no history of alcohol abuse, nor intravenous drug use and were tested negative for HCV (PCR RNA) and had no HBS antigen. Patient 1 had a past history of hypertrygliceridemia, but controlled with dietetic measures for 4 years prior to biopsy. The first hepatic biopsy showed a disseminated macrovacuolar steatosis (>80%). The patient had then cytolysis and an uncontrolled HIV viral load. The second biopsy was performed two years later, and HIV was controlled by a new line of ART. It showed a regression of the steatosis (10%) and a progression of the fibrosis with signs of cirrhosis. Patient 2 had a long history of HIV infection. He also had an uncontrolled dyslipidemia. The first biopsy was realised during a period of uncontrolled HIV infection and elevated liver enzymes. The biopsy showed a major macrovacuolar steatosis (>80%). The second biopsy was realised 6 years after and showed the same steatosis and signs of cirrhosis. The HIV infection was then under control. Observations reported here show a rapid evolution of liver steatosis to cirrhosis in HIV positive / HCV negative patients, despite the control of HIV infection. The implication of HAART remains unclear. In the era of HAART, liver steatosis can rapidly evoluate to cirrhosis without any risk factor except ART."
6992,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the influence of host genetics on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection, we examined 94 repeatedly exposed seronegative (ES) individuals for polymorphisms in multiple genes and compared the results with those for 316 HIV-1-seropositive and 425 HIV-1-seronegative individuals. The frequency of homozygous C-C chemokine receptor (CCR) 5- Delta 32 was higher in ES (3.2%) than in HIV-1-seropositive individuals (0.0%; P=.012). However, the CCR5-59029A, CCR2-64I, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1-3'A, RANTES (regulated on activation, normally T cell-expressed and -secreted)-403A, and RANTES-28G polymorphisms were not associated with resistance to HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, we identified novel variants in the DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin) repeat region and observed that heterozygous DC-SIGN reduced the risk of HIV-1 infection (3.2% in ES individuals vs. 0.0% in HIV-1-seropositive individuals; P=.011)."
9720,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of different genotypes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Ethiopia is not known. HCV genotypes influence the response to therapy with alpha-interferon alone or in combination with ribavirin. A cross sectional study was conducted on attendees of voluntary counseling and testing center. Serum samples from 1,954 (734 HIV positive and 1,220 HIV negative) individuals were screened for HCV antibody. Active HCV infection was confirmed by quantitative PCR in 18 of the 71 samples with anti-HCV antibodies. The HCV viral load ranged from 39,650 to 9,878,341 IU/ml (median 1,589,631 IU/ml) with no significant difference [œá(2)(17)‚Äâ= 18.00, P = 0.389] between persons positive or negative for HIV. The viral load of HCV was, however, higher in older study subjects (r = 0.80, P = 0.000). HCV genotypes were determined using the VERSANT HCV Genotype Assay (LiPA) and sequence analysis of the NS5b region of the HCV genome. Diverse HCV genotypes were found including genotypes 1, 2, 4, and 5. There was no difference in the distribution regarding the HIV status. As in other parts of the world, genotyping of HCV must be considered whenever HCV is incriminated as a cause of hepatitis."
9020,0.005,1.0000,"There is an increase in the cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity in individuals infected with HIV that may be due to inflammatory lipid modulation not captured by traditional lipid measures. The objective of this study was to perform advanced lipoprotein phenotyping inclusive of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol efflux capacity and lipoprotein particle concentration and size in a well-phenotyped group of 118 patients infected with HIV. We used simple and multivariable analyses to determine the associations between advanced lipoprotein parameters and known cardiometabolic risk factors. Participants were on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) and had benign traditional lipid panels [median total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides of 178‚Äâmg/dl, 108‚Äâmg/dl, 44‚Äâmg/dl, and 122.5‚Äâmg/dl, respectively]. However, advanced lipoprotein phenotyping demonstrated an elevation of LDL particle number (median of 1,233‚Äânmol/liter) and a decrease in LDL size (median of 20.4‚Äânm), along with a decrease in protective, large HDL particles (median of 3.15‚ÄâŒºmol/liter) and reduced HDL cholesterol efflux capacity in comparison to controls of other studies. HDL cholesterol efflux capacity was associated with HDL levels (Œ≤=0.395, p<0.001), small LDL particle concentration (Œ≤=-0.198, p=0.031), insulin sensitivity by the Matsuda index (Œ≤=0.218, p=0.029), and the Framingham Risk Score (Œ≤=-0.184, p=0.046). We demonstrate an atherogenic lipoprotein profile by NMR spectroscopy and HDL efflux measurement in a group of HIV-infected patients on stable ART with normal lipid panels."
7210,0.005,1.0000,"Cardiac disease is being recognized as a complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, as more effective therapy is producing longer survival in patients with HIV infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Cardiac disease may occur coincidentally in a patient with AIDS, as a complication of AIDS, as a result of therapy for AIDS, or even as a direct result of HIV infection of the heart. Congestive heart failure (CHF) carries a poor prognosis and is best treated with traditional therapy. All patients with HIV/AIDS should get a baseline echocardiogram and electrocardiogram (ECG), because many patients are asymptomatic. Patients with low CD4 counts, those receiving zidovudine, and intravenous drug users must be further evaluated. Most patients with symptomatic effusions have a potentially treatable cause (neoplasm or infection), and a full workup must be initiated; however, small asymptomatic effusions often can be observed and followed by serial echocardiography. Physicians should be more alert to cardiac involvement in patients with HIV. Earlier surveillance is warranted and may lead to earlier treatment and supportive care."
7393,0.005,1.0000,"The selenium concentration in the serum of 67 patients with HIV infection was measured to determine whether selenium deficiency occurred in the different stages of the disease. In the first stage of the study, patients were divided into four groups: symptom-free subjects, PGL (persistent generalized lymphadenopathy), ARC (AIDS related complex), and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Selenium concentrations were normal in HIV antibody positive symptom-free subjects (1.18 +/- 0.27 mumol/L) and lower than normal in the other three groups (p less than 0.001). There was a significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between selenium levels and values of hemoglobin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Selenium deficiency was in no case associated with a lack of zinc in serum (also determined in all patients). In the second stage of the study, 12 patients were treated for a period of two months with low doses of selenium to assess whether such supplementation was able to restore their impaired immunological and hematological functions. The therapy increased serum selenium concentrations (from 0.77 +/- 0.23 to 1.44 +/- 0.41 mumol/L) and symptomatic improvements were noted. However, no changes were observed in the immunological and hematological parameters."
5215,0.005,1.0000,"Human lymphoid cell lines were transfected with HIV-1-LTR-CAT DNA and permanently transformed cell lines were obtained. These transformed cell lines were treated with 0.01 mM H2O2 for 25 days and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activities of these cell lines were measured. The CAT activities of transformed cell lines were latent in normal culture conditions, but were activated by retreatment with 0.2 mM H2O2 for 1 h. On treatment with 0.05 mM H2O2 for 1 h, the CAT activity of these cell lines maintained in normal conditions remained latent, whereas cell lines pretreated with 0.01 mM H2O2 for 25 days were greatly activated by this treatment. Here, the HIV-1 promoter seemed latent in normal culture conditions, but it could be activated by a comparatively low concentration (0.05 mM) of H2O2 after treatment with a dilute H2O2 (0.01 mM) for about 1 month. Many patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) show a long latent period before development of AIDS. During this latent period, their infected cells may be subjected to oxidative stress due to metabolism and physical movement. The present results indicate that oxidative stress may cause activation of the HIV-1 promoter in patients with latent HIV-1."
3364,0.005,1.0000,"Neurodegeneration and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-associated dementia (HAD) are the major disease manifestations of HIV-1 colonization of the central nervous system (CNS). In the brain, HIV-1 replicates in microglial cells and infiltrating macrophages and it persists in a low-productive, noncytolytic state in astrocytes. Astrocytes play critical roles in the maintenance of the brain microenvironment, responses to injury, and in neuronal signal transmission, and disruption of these functions by HIV-1 could contribute to HAD. To better understand the potential effects of HIV-1 on astrocyte biology, the authors investigated changes in gene expression using an efficient and sensitive rapid subtraction hybridization approach, RaSH. Primary human astrocytes were isolated from abortus brain tissue, low-passage cells were infected with HIV-1 or mock infected, and total cellular RNAs were isolated at multiple time points over a period of 1 week. This approach is designed to identify gene products modulated early and late after HIV-1 infection and limits the cloning of genes displaying normal cell-cycle fluctuations in astrocytes. By subtracting temporal cDNAs derived from HIV-1-infected astrocytes from temporal cDNAs made from uninfected cells, 10 genes displaying reduced expression in infected cells, termed astrocyte suppressed genes (ASGs), were identified and their suppression was confirmed by Northern blot hybridization. Both known and novel ASGs, not reported in current DNA databases, that are down-regulated by HIV-1 infection are described. Northern blotting confirms suppression of the same panel of ASGs by treatment of astrocytes with recombinant HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120. These results extend our previous analysis of astrocyte genes induced or enhanced by HIV-1 infection and together they suggest that HIV-1 and viral proteins have profound effects on astrocyte physiology, which may influence their function in the CNS."
9104,0.005,1.0000,"Monocytes and brain macrophage-microglial cells are thought to play a crucial role in the neurologic dysfunction associated with HIV-1 disease. Since neopterin is produced by monocytes-macrophages, we asked whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neopterin levels increase before the onset of HIV-1 neurologic disease and whether they correlate with other CSF and peripheral blood immunologic parameters. In this study, CSF neopterin levels from 159 neurologically asymptomatic HIV-positive persons were found to increase as the blood CD4+ T-cell count decreased and as CSF IgG, IgG synthesis, IgG index, and beta 2-microglobulin increased. Neopterin levels in the CSF exceeded those in the serum in 32% of patients, while 25% had CSF levels > 13.5 nmol/liter. CSF neopterin levels vary with immune status, may reflect intrathecal production, and can be elevated in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients with normal neurologic examinations. Long-term follow-up of this patient population should be able to define the clinical correlation between CSF neopterin levels during the asymptomatic phase of HIV-1 disease and the risk of subsequent neurologic disease."
3362,0.005,1.0000,"Neurodegeneration and dementia are common complications of AIDS caused by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the central nervous system. HIV-1 target cells in the brain include microglia, infiltrating macrophages and astrocytes, but rarely neurons. Astrocytes play an important role in the maintenance of the synaptic micro-environment and in neuronal signal transmission. To investigate potential changes in cellular gene expression associated with HIV-1 infection of astrocytes, we employed an efficient and sensitive rapid subtraction hybridization approach, RaSH. Primary human astrocytes were isolated from abortus brain tissue and low-passage cells were infected with HIV-1. To identify genes that display both early and late expression modifications after HIV-1 infection and to avoid cloning genes displaying normal cell cycle fluctuations in astrocytes, RNAs were isolated and pooled from 6, 12, 24 h and 3 and 7 day uninfected and infected cells and used for RaSH. Temporal cDNA libraries were prepared from double-stranded cDNAs that were enzymatically digested into small fragments, ligated to adapters, PCR amplified, and hybridized by incubation of tester and driver PCR fragments. By subtracting temporal cDNAs derived from uninfected astrocytes from temporal cDNAs made from HIV-1 infected cells, genes displaying elevated expression in virus infected cells, termed astrocyte elevated genes (AEGs), were identified. Both known and novel AEGs, not reported in current DNA databases, are described that display early or late expression kinetics following HIV-1 infection or treatment with recombinant HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp120). For selected AEGs, expression of their protein products was also tested by Western blotting and found to display elevated expression following HIV-1 infection. The comparable pattern of regulation of the AEGs following HIV-1 infection or gp120 treatment suggest that HIV-1 exposure of astrocytes, even in the absence of productive infection, can induce changes in cellular gene expression."
252,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 infection is associated with B-cell abnormalities, such as hypergammaglobulinemia, poor immunization responses, and loss of serologic memory. To determine whether altered expression of chemokine receptors and their ligands may play a role in B-cell dysfunctions during HIV-1 infection, the expression of CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), CXCR5, and CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and their respective ligands on CD19(+) B cells were examined in HIV-1-infected patients and controls. We report a decreased CXCR5 expression on B cells from patients (P < .05), a phenomenon associated with a low CD4 T-cell count (< 350 cells/microL). Interestingly, an increased expression of CXC chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13), the ligand for CXCR5, was found in peripheral B cells from HIV-1-infected patients. Moreover, on B-cell activation in vitro, CXCL13 was secreted in culture. CXCL13(+) B cells were also found in the lymph nodes of HIV-1-infected patients, but not in control tissue. B-cell migration toward CXCL13, CXCL12, and CC chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21), ligands for CXCR5, CXCR4, and CCR7 was also evaluated. In patients with a low CD4 T-cell count, migration toward all ligands was increased. Our findings indicate that altered expression of the chemokine receptor-ligand pair, CXCR5/CXCL13, may participate in the establishment of B-cell dysfunctions during HIV-1 infection."
2587,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) activity has been suggested to correlate with protection from progression to AIDS. We have examined the relationship between HIV-specific CTL activity and maintenance of peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocyte counts and control of viral load in 17 long-term survivors (LTSs) of HIV-1 infection. Longitudinal analysis indicated that the LTS cohort demonstrated a decreased rate of CD4+ T cell loss (18 cells/mm3/year) compared with typical normal progressors (approximately 60 cells/mm3/year). The majority of the LTSs had detectable, variable, and in some individuals, quite high (>10(4) RNA copies/ml) plasma viral load during the study period. In a cross-sectional analysis, HIV-specific CTL activity to HIV Gag, Pol, and Env proteins was detectable in all 17 LTSs. Simultaneous analysis of HIV-1 Gag-Pol, and Env-specific CTLs and virus load in protease inhibitor-naive individuals showed a significant inverse correlation between Pol-specific CTL activity and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (p = 0.001). Furthermore, using a mixed linear effects model the combined effects of HIV-1 Pol- and Env-specific CTL activity on the viral load were significantly stronger than the effects of HIV-1 Pol-specific CTL activity alone on predicted virus load. These data suggest that the presence of HIV-1-specific CTL activity in HIV-1-infected long-term survivors is an important component in the effective control of HIV-1 replication."
1656,0.005,1.0000,"One thousand one hundred fifty-two HIV-1-positive patients were screened for HTLV-2 infection, and the AIDS-free coinfected individuals were consecutively included in a longitudinal study with the aim of investigating the role of HTLV-2 in the progression to AIDS and the development of specific neurologic diseases. Two matched HIV-1-positive/HTLV-2-negative controls for each coinfected individual were also enrolled in the study. HTLV-2 infection was found in 95 (8.2%) of the HIV-1-positive patients, 30 of whom were followed up for a median of 28.5 months. No significant differences were observed between them and the patients infected with HIV-1 alone in terms of the rate of decline in CD4 cell counts, progression to AIDS, or AIDS mortality, but they had an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (hazard ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-8.0; p =.009). One coinfected patient developed myelopathy during the follow-up. In the second part of the study, aimed at preliminarily assessing the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the incidence of peripheral neuropathy, we extended our observations to two groups of coinfected and singly infected individuals receiving HAART. An 80% decrease in incidence of peripheral neuropathy was observed among both groups without any significant difference between them. These results support the hypothesis that HTLV-2 plays a role in the development of neurologic abnormalities in HIV-1-infected patients and suggest that the immune reconstitution due to HAART may limit the activity of HTLV-2 as an opportunistic agent."
8629,0.005,1.0000,"We examined the prevalence of HIV, general medical, and psychiatric comorbidities by age based on a recent multisite cohort of HIV infected veterans receiving care: the Veterans with HIV/AIDS 3 Site Study (VACS 3). VACS 3 includes 881 adult patients with HIV infection enrolled between June 1999 and July 2000. Providers reported their patients' CDC-defined HIV comorbidities, general medical comorbidities (based on Duke and Charlson comorbidity scales), and psychiatric comorbidity. Mean age of participants was 49 years and 54% were African-American. The most common HIV comorbidities were oral candidiasis (21%), peripheral neuropathy (16%), and herpes zoster (16%). The most common general medical comorbidities included chemical hepatitis (53%), hypertension (24%), and hyperlipidemia (17%). The mean number of HIV and general medical comorbidities experienced by patients were respectively 1.1 and 1.4 (P < .001). Older (> or = 50 years) HIV-infected patients experienced a greater number of general medical comorbidities than those < 50 years (respectively 1.7 versus 1.2, P < .001). There was no significant difference in mean HIV comorbidity number by age. Based on patient report, 46% had significant depressive symptoms (> or = 10 on 10-item CES-D) and 21% reported at-risk drinking (> or = 8 on AUDIT). Providers reported 32% of patients had anxiety, 4% mania, 4% schizophrenia, and 11% cognitive impairment/dementia. General medical and psychiatric comorbidities constituted a higher disease burden for HIV-infected veterans than HIV comorbidities. Whether these comorbidities are due to antiretroviral drug toxicity or are age or lifestyle-associated conditions, the substantial prevalence of these ""non-HIV"" comorbidities suggest an important role for general medical and psychiatric management of HIV-infected patients."

Despite the lack of overt clinical disease, the asymptomatic phase is characterized by persistent immunologic impairment. In the peripheral blood obtained from cats experimentally infected with FIV-C for approximately 5 years, we identified a persistent inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio. We cloned and sequenced the FIV-C long terminal repeat containing the viral promoter from cells infected with the inoculating virus and from in vivo-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4 T cells isolated at multiple time points throughout the asymptomatic phase. Relative to the inoculating virus, viral sequences amplified from cells isolated from all of the infected animals demonstrated multiple single nucleotide mutations and a short deletion within the viral U3, R and U5 regions. A transcriptionally inactivating proviral mutation in the U3 promoter AP-1 site was identified at multiple time points from all of the infected animals but not within cell-associated viral RNA. In contrast, no mutations were identified within the sequence of the viral dUTPase gene amplified from PBMC isolated at approximately 5 years post-infection relative to the inoculating sequence. The possible implications of these mutations to viral pathogenesis are discussed. "
9892,0.005,1.0000,"There is increasing evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections with different genotypes and subgenotypes differ in response to treatment and long-term prognosis. The differences emerge from variability within the genomes that leads to structural deviations at the pregenomic level and to changes at the translational level. Naturally occurring HBV strains covering the four major genotypes A-D were obtained from 393 patients and part of the genome was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequenced, and analyzed for mutational differences in the precore and core promoter regions. The study confirmed that core promoter and precore mutations occur at key positions (A1762T, G1764A, G1896A, and G1899A), and that the proportions of strains with seroconvertion in patients differ between the four HBV genotypes. A rare double mutation (C1857T together with G1897A) was observed, and C1856T was found together with the emerging G1898A mutation, which itself was found to be more widespread geographically than previously described. We found a novel mutation (T1850C), never before observed in human HBV strains but known from woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV). A novel association of mutation C1773T with G1764T, C1766A, and G1757A was also found within a site already suggested to be a putative binding site for HNF-3. This novel association is proposed by us to be of importance for additional binding of HNH-2 to this site and is a better indicator of the emergence of the double mutation G1764T and C1766A than the G1757A mutation proposed previously."
8907,0.005,1.0000,"In the Mediterranean region almost all patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis are anti-HBV e antigen (anti-HBeAg)-positive and carriers of HBeAg-negative virus mutants. The six members of a family who acquired HBV infection were recently studied: two siblings developed cirrhosis with persistence of HBeAg positivity, whereas their parents and two more siblings cleared the virus. The two cirrhotic patients showed homozygosity for HLA class I by phenotype, which is a rare occurrence in the general population, while the other family members were heterozygous for HLA class I. The sequencing analyses of the entire viral DNAs isolated from both cirrhotic patients showed that the two viral genomes were almost identical and no mutation preventing HbeAg synthesis or viral gene expression was present. These findings might suggest that homozygosity for HLA class I molecules might be responsible for an insufficient response to the virus, favouring chronic outcome of the infection and the long-lasting persistence of HBV populations that produce HBeAg."
644,0.005,1.0000,"The nonstructural 5B (NS5B) protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity plays a pivotal role in viral replication. Therefore, monitoring of its naturally occurring mutations is very important for the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines. In the present study, mutations in the partial NS5B gene (492 bp) from 166 quasispecies of 15 genotype-1b (GT) treatment-na√Øve Korean chronic patients were determined and mutation patterns and frequencies mainly focusing on the T cell epitope regions were evaluated. The mutation frequency within the CD8+ T cell epitopes was significantly higher than those outside the CD8+ T cell epitopes. Of note, the mutation frequency within predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, a particular mutational hotspot in Korean patients was significantly higher than it was in patients from other areas, suggesting distinctive CD4+ T cell-mediated immune pressure against HCV infection in the Korean population. The mutation frequency in the NS5B region was positively correlated with patients with carrier-stage rather than progressive liver disease (chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Furthermore, the mutation frequency in four codons (Q309, A333, V338 and Q355) known to be related to the sustained virological response (SVR) and end-of treatment response (ETR) was also significantly higher in Korean patients than in patients from other areas. In conclusion, a high degree of mutation frequency in the HCV GT-1b NS5B region, particularly in the predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, was found in Korean patients, suggesting the presence of distinctive CD4+ T cell pressure in the Korean population. This provides a likely explanation of why relatively high levels of SVR after a combined therapy of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) in Korean chronic patients with GT-1b infections are observed.

5606,0.005,1.0000,"Molecular clones of HIV-1 were obtained from isolates cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and directly from uncultured PBMCs from a laboratory worker accidentally infected with the HIV-1 laboratory strain, HIV-1(HTLV-IIIB). Envelope sequences corresponding to the first 752 amino acids of HIV-1(HTLV-IIIB) clone BH10 were obtained from clones of cultured virus and sequenced. Three env clones obtained shortly after infection differed among themselves at only seven nucleotide positions, resulting in one amino acid substitution and one frameshift mutation. These envelope sequences were as similar to the envelope sequences of various IIIB clones as the latter were to each other. env divergence increased over the course of infection. However, the overall diversity in env clones obtained two or more years after infection was still comparable to that among IIIB env clones from the original IIIB culture. Multiple clones of partial env gene sequences containing the V3 loop were also obtained directly from uncultured PBMCs by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The env sequences of these clones were generally similar to those of the cultured viruses. Within the V3 region, the earliest isolates retained the sequence of the HXB2 clone from IIIB. Clones obtained later showed a progressive divergence in V3. An A-to-T substitution within the GPGRAF sequence at the tip of the V3 loop was observed within 1 year after infection, and this mutation predominated in all subsequent isolates. Antibodies against the V3 loops of IIIB and divergent 1987 and 1990 LW isolates appeared simultaneously in laboratory worker serum and persisted with no significant differences in titer. Furthermore, neutralization studies with autologous sequential sera suggested selection for the A-to-T change in V3 was not due to V3-directed antibodies. These results demonstrate a surprising homogeneity among env sequences of HIV-1 from an infected laboratory worker, perhaps because the initial infection originated from a relatively homogeneous population of tissue culture-adapted virus."

The 2.3 per cent positivity in the test group and the 8 per cent positivity in the control group did not suggest the involvement of hepatitis-B virus (HBV), as an influencing or associated agent. When 48 patients with glomerulonephropathies and 23 controls were screened for liver cell membrane (LMA) and renal cell membrane antibodies (RMA) by indirect immunofluorescent technique using isolated rat hepatocytes and renal cells, 79.2 per cent LMA positivity was seen in the HBsAg positive group and 41.7 per cent in the negative group and RMA positivity was 58 per cent in the positive group and 25 per cent in the negative group. Simultaneous positivity for both LMA and RMA was recorded in 50 per cent of the HBsAg positive patients and 15.7 per cent of the negative ones. The results suggest the possibility of an organ specific autoimmune trigger more frequently in HBV associated glomerulonephropathy."
4844,0.005,1.0000,"A major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 infection is the presence of a pool of long-lived, latently infected CD4+ memory T-cells. The search for treatments to re-activate latent HIV to aid in clearance is hindered by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that lead to transcriptional silencing of viral gene expression in host cells. Here we identify a previously unknown role for RUNX1 in HIV-1 transcriptional latency. The RUNX proteins, in combination with the co-factor CBF-Œ≤, are critical transcriptional regulators in T-cells. RUNX1 strongly modulates CD4 expression and contributes to CD4+ T-cell function. We show that RUNX1 can bind DNA sequences within the HIV-1 LTR and that this binding represses transcription. Using patient samples we show a negative correlation between RUNX1 expression and viral load. Furthermore, we find that pharmacologic inhibition of RUNX1 by a small molecule inhibitor, Ro5-3335, synergizes with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) to enhance the activation of latent HIV-1 in both cell lines and PBMCs from patients. Our findings indicate that RUNX1 and CBF-Œ≤ cooperate in cells to modulate HIV-1 replication, identifying for the first time RUNX1 as a cellular factor involved in HIV-1 latency. This work highlights the therapeutic potential of inhibitors of RUNX1 to re-activate virus and aid in clearance of HIV-1. "
5634,0.005,1.0000,"Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are among the most common genetic alterations found in many different human malignancies, including those of the colon, lung, and breast. Alterations in wild-type p53 lead to loss of the suppressor function and thus contribute to tumorigenesis. The potential role of p53 mutations in a sampling of B-cell lymphomas, the majority of which were associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), was investigated. Twenty-six biopsy specimens from immunocompromised patients, including allograft recipients and patients with AIDS, Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome, and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 infection, in comparison with three Burkitt lymphomas and four Burkitt lymphoma cell lines were analyzed. Mutation in p53 was detected in all four Burkitt lymphoma cell lines as well as the three Burkitt lymphoma biopsy specimens. In patients with AIDS, 5 of 10 lymphomas were EBV positive, and 1 had a mutation in p53. Mutation in p53 was not detected in 14 EBV-positive lymphomas which arose in transplant recipients. These data indicate that with the exception of Burkitt lymphomas, p53 mutations are not involved in the majority EBV-positive B-cell lymphomas which develop in immunocompromised patients."
8452,0.005,1.0000,"HIV/AIDS causes severe dysfunction of the immune system through CD4+ T cell depletion, leading to dysregulation of both the adaptive and innate immune arms. A primary target for viral infection is the gastrointestinal tract, which is a reservoir of CD4+ T cells. In addition to being a major immune hub, the human gastrointestinal tract harbors trillions of commensal microorganisms, the microbiota, which have recently been shown to play critical roles in health. Alterations in the composition and function of microbiota have been implicated in a variety of 'multi-factorial' disorders, including infectious, autoimmune, metabolic, and neoplastic disorders. It is widely accepted that, in addition to its direct role in altering the gastrointestinal CD4+ T cell compartment, HIV infection is characterized by gut microbiota compositional and functional changes. Herein, we review such alterations and discuss their potential local and systemic effects on the HIV-positive host, as well as potential roles of novel microbiota-targeting treatments in modulating HIV progression and associated adverse systemic manifestations."
4429,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is able to evade the host cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response through a variety of escape avenues. Epitopes that are presented to CTLs are first processed in the presenting cell in several steps, including proteasomal cleavage, transport to the endoplasmic reticulum, binding by the HLA molecule, and finally presentation to the T-cell receptor. An understanding of the potential of the virus to escape CTL responses can aid in designing an effective vaccine. To investigate such a potential, we analyzed HIV-1 gag from 468 HIV-1-positive Kenyan women by using several bioinformatic approaches that allowed the identification of positively selected amino acids in the HIV-1 gag region and study of the effects that these mutations could have on the various stages of antigen processing. Correlations between positively selected residues and mean CD4 counts also allowed study of the effect of mutation on HIV disease progression. A number of mutations that could create or destroy proteasomal cleavage sites or reduce binding affinity of the transport antigen processing protein, effectively hindering epitope presentation, were identified. Many mutations correlated with the presence of specific HLA alleles and with lower or higher CD4 counts. For instance, the mutation V190I in subtype A1-infected individuals is associated with HLA-B*5802 (P = 4.73 x 10(-4)), a rapid-progression allele according to other studies, and also to a decreased mean CD4 count (P = 0.019). Thus, V190I is a possible HLA escape mutant. This method classifies many positively selected mutations across the entire gag region according to their potential for immune escape and their effect on disease progression."

Lung biopsies from group A showed minimal thickening of the alveolar walls from oedema and slight mononuclear cell infiltration, while in group B alveolar wall thickening was more prominent with distinct mononuclear cell infiltration and evidence of diffuse alveolar damage and interstitial fibrosis. Infection with P. carinii cysts was heavy in 60%, moderate in 30% and mild in 10% in group A patients v. heavy in 0%, moderate in 14% and mild in 86% in group B patients. These findings appear to suggest that AIDS/PCP presents with a heavy parasite load but only minimal histopathological changes that are reversible and that atypical change as observed in PCP in other immune deficiencies are caused by previous or concomitant insults other than pneumocystosis. Milder propagation of P. carinii in HIV-negative patients may be because there is a lack of undamaged type I pneumocytes to which trophozoites probably need to be attached at a certain developmental stage."
9192,0.005,1.0000,"Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is a distinct variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma initially described in HIV-positive patients. Several studies have reported the occurrence of PBL in HIV-negative patients, but comparative data are lacking. The goal of this study was to compare the characteristics of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with PBL. A MEDLINE search was undertaken through August 2009 for cases of PBL in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. Cases were identified and clinicopathological data were gathered. œá(2) was used to compare categorical and t-test to compare continuous variables between groups. Calculated Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used for multivariate analysis. From 228 identified cases of PBL, 157 were HIV-positive and 71 HIV-negative. HIV-positive patients were younger, and more likely to be men, present with oral involvement, respond to chemotherapy, and express CD20, CD56, and EBV-encoded RNA than HIV-negative patients. In univariate analysis, age‚Äâ‚â•60, advanced stage, bone marrow involvement, no chemotherapy, Ki-67 expression >80%, and HIV-negative status were associated with worse overall survival. In multivariate analysis, advanced stage and no chemotherapy were independent adverse prognostic factors. In conclusion, HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with PBL have different clinicopathological characteristics, including a better response to chemotherapy and longer survival in HIV-positive patients."
679,0.005,1.0000,"A comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in persistently infected culture of T-lymphocytes by means of different morphological and immunomorphological methods: fluorescent antibody method (FAM), immune electron microscopy (IEM), negative staining, and ultrathin section technique, was carried out. The FAM was shown to detect virus antigen exclusively in the cytoplasm of large and multinuclear cells but not in the cytoplasm of small size cells. A marked cyclic pattern (3-passage interval) was established in expression of HIV antigen correlating with changes in the ratio of 3 types of cells in the culture and the intensity of HIV virions production detectable in electron microscopic preparations. The phenomenon of variability of HIV production associated with changes in the ratio of different cell types was used for selection of most productive cultures which were employed as the antigen for antibody determination in sera. The study showed good agreement in antibody detection by the FAM and immunoblotting method."
6108,0.005,1.0000,"The testes and prostates of 14 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) for whom autopsies were performed were examined for the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the pathologic alterations seen in AIDS. Histologically, the testes contained peritubular fibrosis and variable spermatogenic arrest, which were inconsistent with the young age of these patients. There were also numerous foci of germ cell degeneration and occasional germ cell loss. The Leydig cells were atrophic and decreased in number. The prostates contained increased numbers of concretions. Sections of testis and prostate were stained with an anti-HIV P17 monoclonal antibody with the use of the avidin-biotin technique. Small scattered foci of positive staining were identified in 8 of 14 testes (57%). They were located over one or several degenerating germ cells and the surrounding Sertoli cells. In addition, in 9 of 14 prostates (64%) there were a few minute foci of positive staining in several adjacent glandular epithelial cells. In one case the testis was positive and the prostate was negative, whereas in two cases the testes were negative and the prostate positive. In contrast, 22 testes and 22 prostates of control non-AIDS patients, read double-blind, were negative. The positive controls were HIV-infected tissue culture HUT 78 lymphoma cells in which there were many scattered positive cells. The results indicate the presence of focal HIV-associated protein in the testes and prostates of patients with AIDS, particularly within the foci of germ cell degeneration. The present observations are in accordance with previous research demonstrating the presence of HIV in the seminal fluid of patients with AIDS and appears to indicate the presence of an infection of the male genital tract by the HIV virus."
9481,0.005,1.0000,"We examined the association of primary or nonprimary sexual partner relationship status on sexual risk behaviors, including condom use, among Latina women who are at self-disclosed increased heterosexual risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Data were collected via structured interviews of 187 Puerto Rican women, aged 18-35, who attended a health clinic in the Bronx, New York. Approximately 13% of participants reported sexual activities with both primary and nonprimary sexual partners during the 6 months prior to the interview. Primary or nonprimary sexual partner status was associated with significant differences in frequency of condom use during anal sex and oral-penile sex, with more frequent condom use reported during these sexual activities with nonprimary sexual partners. Thus, potential contextual differences associated with primary or nonprimary relationship status may represent important factors to consider when designing interventions to facilitate HIV-protective behaviors among populations of urban women identified at increased heterosexual risk for HIV infection."

Because children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be immunosuppressed, immunization of these children with live virus vaccines is a potential problem. A retrospective survey was conducted by the New York City Department of Health, with consultation from the Centers for Disease Control, to evaluate the frequency of serious adverse events following receipt of live vaccines among children with HIV infection receiving pediatric care in New York City and New Jersey. Outpatient records of 319 children being cared for by 16 participating physicians were reviewed. Of the 319 charts, 221 (69%) contained vaccination histories. Perinatal transmission of HIV infection was suspected for 208 (94%) of the 221 cases and infection via transfusion for the remaining 13 (6%). Of the 221 for whom immunization histories were available, 180 (81%) had received at least one dose of live oral polio vaccine and 70 (32%) had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. There were 120 children for whom a temporal relationship between immunization and onset of symptoms of immunodeficiency could be seen; 46/120 had received at least one dose of oral polio vaccine and 23/45 had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine after onset of symptoms. Although follow-up of this population has been limited, there were no reports of serious adverse events such as typical or atypical measles, paralytic poliomyelitis, or aseptic meningitis in the month following vaccination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5779,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) is a sexually transmitted pathogen that can infect cells in the female reproductive tract (FRT). The mechanism of viral transmission within the FRT and the mode of viral spread to the periphery are not well understood. To characterize the frequency of potential targets of HIV infection within the FRT, we performed a systematic study of the expression of HIV receptors (CD4, galactosyl ceramide (GalCer)) and coreceptors (CXCR4 and CCR5) on epithelial cells and leucocytes from the ectocervix. The ectocervix is a likely first site of contact with HIV-1 following heterosexual transmission, and expression of these receptors is likely to correlate with susceptibility to viral infection. We obtained ectocervical tissue specimens from women undergoing hysterectomy, and compared expression of these receptors among patients who were classified as being in the proliferative or secretory phases of their menstrual cycle at the time of hysterectomy, as well as from postmenopausal tissues. Epithelial cells from tissues at early and mid-proliferative stages of the menstrual cycle express CD4, although by late proliferative and secretory phases, CD4 expression was absent or weak. In contrast, GalCer expression was uniform in all stages of the menstrual cycle. CXCR4 expression was not detected on ectocervical epithelial cells and positive staining was only evident on individual leucocytes. In contrast, CCR5 expression was detected on ectocervical epithelial cells from tissues at all stages of the menstrual cycle. Overall, our results suggest that HIV infection of cells in the ectocervix could most likely occur through GalCer and CCR5. These findings are important to define potential targets of HIV-1 infection within the FRT, and for the future design of approaches to reduce the susceptibility of women to infection by HIV-1."
6721,0.005,1.0000,"A prospective cohort study of 318 human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected and 309 seronegative pregnant women was carried out in Butare, Rwanda. Birth weight was significantly lower among singleton infants born alive to HIV-1-infected mothers compared with those born alive to seronegative mothers (2706 g vs. 2825 g; P = 0.002). Crown-to-heel length, head circumference, chest circumference and placental weight were also reduced. Maternal HIV-1 infection was significantly associated with intrauterine growth retardation but not with preterm birth. Differences in the body mass index and weight/head ratio suggest that the adverse impact on live born infants may have been most severe towards the end of pregnancy, resulting in a lean infant with a relatively large head. The higher frequency of intrauterine growth retardation could not be explained by potential confounding factors such as maternal cigarette smoking, history of sexually transmitted diseases or sociodemographic characteristics. The neonatal physical examination did not reveal any differences in clinical signs or symptoms within 48 hours of birth except for the presence of conjunctivitis which was more common among infants of HIV-1-infected mothers. The perinatal and neonatal mortality rates were not significantly affected by maternal HIV-1 status."

We therefore conducted a phase I, clinical safety trial of a dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination strategy as immunotherapy for HIV-1-positive individuals on ART. We studied 18 HIV-1-positive subjects on ART who underwent leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells for DC generation from monocytes cultured with cytokines. Mature DC were pulsed with three HIV-1 HLA*A0201 Gag, Env, and Pol peptides and one influenza A virus matrix protein peptide. The vaccine was administered to donors randomized to receive two vaccinations, either intravenously or subcutaneously. The primary end points were safety and tolerability of two doses of peptide-DC vaccine (3 million versus 10 million). Secondary end points included gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses and clinical correlates of an immune response to vaccination. Autologous DC-peptide vaccine was safe, well tolerated, and feasible for use in all participants. Adverse events were rare. Although the trial was not powered to assess an immunologic response, a significantly increased frequency of HIV-1 peptide-specific IFN-gamma-positive cells was observed 2 weeks following the second vaccine, with three individuals responding to all four peptides. DC vaccination was safe, was feasible, and showed promise of immunogenicity in ART-treated, HIV-1-positive individuals. Additional studies of DC immunization strategies for HIV-1 infection are warranted."

HIV and AIDS have a special impact on working-age populations, economic resources, certain illnesses, and health care facilities. Assessment of HIV serostatus of hospitalized patients is rarely performed, however, because of a reluctance to intrude on patient confidentiality, a perceived lack of benefit (no antiretroviral therapy is available), and societal denial. We evaluated the effect on health care of HIV testing of patients routinely admitted to medical wards in the 2 major city hospitals in Harare, Zimbabwe. Of 196 patients tested, 58% were HIV positive with strong associations with infectious diseases, and with youth and weight loss, but not with cardiac, pulmonary, endocrinologic, or renal diagnoses, and not with rural versus urban location, occupation, sex, mortality, or cost of hospitalization. The clinical estimate of patients' HIV serostatus was largely inaccurate. Mandatory HIV testing of all hospitalized patients would improve diagnosis of infectious diseases, clarify patient prognosis, allow for individual counseling with regard to HIV prevention, and focus national health efforts by providing alarming, realistic statistics."

Family nutritional support was proposed to patients with CD-4 cell count <200 /mm3 and/or developing a WHO stage III/IV or with body mass index <18.5 kg/m2 and receiving antiretroviral treatment. Follow-up of 62 patients receiving support was compared to 118 patients who had only received antiretroviral treatment the year before. Average body mass index, CD-4 cell count were 20.7 and 20.5, 217 and 191/mm3 respectively in supported and control groups (NS). Twenty-two (36%) and 56 (48%) were WHO stage III/IV (NS) respectively in supported and control groups. One patient who received support and twelve controls died (Mortality Ratio=0.19; p<0.05). Increase in CD-4 cell count was around 1.7 times higher (+ 114 vs. + 68 CD-4 cells/mm3 respectively in supported and control groups; p<0.05) and observance was improved in supported group (p<0.005). The evolutions of WHO stage and body mass index were not different but the study period was short. Family nutritional support for persons living with HIV initiating antiretroviral treatment in a developing country showed a positive impact after six months.

Participants will be HIV positive and ‚â• 21 years of age; surrogates will be ‚â• 18 years of age. Exclusion criteria are homicidality, suicidality, psychosis, and impaired cognitive functioning. We hypothesize that this intervention will enhance patient-centered communication with a surrogate decision-maker about end of life treatment preferences over time, enhance patient quality of life and decrease health care utilization. We further hypothesize that this intervention will decrease health disparities for Blacks in completion of advance directives.

4026,0.005,1.0000,"Objectives The longer survival of patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and the introduction of the highly active antiretroviral therapy have increased the number of chronic conditions; among these, cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study is to determine patient, disease, and factors associated with peripheral arterial disease in a population of patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Methods A prospective nested case-control study of a cohort of patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was conducted in a tertiary medical center in Mexico City. A sample size of 206 patients was calculated. Medical history, relevant laboratory data, peripheral arterial exam, and screening ankle-brachial index tests were obtained. Results The prevalence of abnormal ankle-brachial indexes was 20% (42 patients). Patient's mean age was 44 years‚Äâ¬±13. The majority (98.5%) were actively receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy; active smoking was reported in 55 (27%), arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus were found in 24 (12%) and 22 (11%) patients. Median time from the human immunodeficiency virus diagnosis was eight years (Interquartile range‚Äâ¬±11); the mean CD4 count was 481, with a mean viral load of 13,557 copies (SD‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ69025.27) and 1889.18 (SD‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ9052.77) for patients with normal and abnormal ankle-brachial index and a median of 40 (IQ‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ2). Viral load ( p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.04) and number of years with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.04) were significantly associated with abnormal ankle-brachial indexes. Conclusions Abnormal ankle-brachial index seems to be more frequent in Mexican patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when compared with the general population at the same age. The most important factors associated with arterial disease were the viral load and the number of years with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."

Increasingly, pharmacists are becoming involved in patient-care activities that place them at risk for HIV exposure. These activities include participation on cardiac resuscitation teams, monitoring concentrations of drugs in patient samples that they themselves may collect, administering intravenous drugs, and performing a wide variety of primary-care duties in such outpatient settings as anticoagulation, diabetes, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-oncology clinics. Pharmacists can protect themselves against HIV infection by following established infection control procedures; at the same time, they must exercise responsibility for the safety of their associates, of pharmacy technicians, students, and residents, and of other health-care workers. In many institutions this responsibility is shared with nurses. As educators, pharmacists must play a leading role in the dissemination of correct, up-to-date information about HIV infection, body substances precautions, and new product use and availability in both the hospital and the community. The expanded role of pharmacists places them at higher risk for HIV infection but also creates opportunities for them to exercise leadership in the fight against AIDS."

With the goal of targeting future cessation interventions, we sought to identify factors associated with smoking status, readiness and confidence in cessation, and success in quitting. As part of a larger study in New York City assessing predictors of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we enrolled HIV-infected subjects at least 35 years of age without known asthma or COPD. Current smokers received detailed tobacco history, and smoking status was assessed by chart review at 3 and 6 months post-enrollment. Two hundred subjects were enrolled (29% current smokers, 31.5% never smokers, 39.5% former smokers, mean age of 49, 84% male, 64% had AIDS, and 97% were receiving antiretroviral therapy). Current smokers had higher unemployment and increased rates of other substance use than former smokers or never smokers. In multivariate analysis, being unemployed and having used inhalant drugs were associated with current smoking. Substance abuse history was not correlated with readiness to quit or patient estimated cessation. Lower education was associated with decreased readiness to quit. Follow-up smoking status for baseline current smokers was available for 47/58 enrollees at 6 months; 4 (9%) stopped smoking completely, and 17 (36%) decreased the number of packs-per-day. Smoking and concomitant substance abuse is common in HIV, and special attention should be given to this issue, in addition to a patient's readiness to quit, when implementing tobacco cessation protocols, especially in busy urban HIV care centers."
5697,0.005,1.0000,"Dolutegravir, is a second generation integrase inhibitor that had recently received United States Food and Drug Administration and European Commission approval for the treatment of adult patients with HIV-1 infection. Dolutegravir provides distinct advantages compared with first generation integrase inhibitors. Unlike raltegravir, dolutegravir can be given once daily for patients who are antiretroviral treatment na√Øve. Once-a-day dolutegravir dosing also does not require a pharmacokinetic booster like elvitegravir which minimizes the drug-drug interaction potential of dolutegravir. In Phase III clinical trials, dolutegravir-containing regimens have demonstrated either non-inferiority or superiority to current first line agents such as raltegravir, darunavir/ritonavir, and efavirenz containing regimens. Moreover, dolutegravir may be effective for patients with a history of raltegravir and/or elvitegravir resistance. Dolutegravir will likely play a major role in the management of patients with HIV-1 infection, and will be aided when coformulation with abacavir/lamivudine as a single pill, once-daily regimen is available.

Considering the mechanism of action, it is expected that this drug will be effective only in a subpopulation of HIV-1-infected people, namely those harbouring the R5 virus. The favourable toxicity profile of the drug has been demonstrated in Phase III clinical trials in treatment-naive (MERIT) and treatment-experienced (MOTIVATE) patients. In the latter population, maraviroc showed a superior antiviral efficacy and immunological activity compared with optimized backbone therapy + placebo. However, in MERIT, a prospective double-blind, randomized trial in treatment-naive patients, maraviroc + zidovudine/lamivudine failed to prove non-inferiority to efavirenz + zidovudine/lamivudine as standard of care regimen in the 48 week intention-to-treat analysis. Using an assay with higher sensitivity for minority CXCR4-using (X4) HIV variants (the enhanced Trofile assay-Monogram), non-inferiority was reached for the maraviroc- versus efavirenz-based combination. These data indicate the important impact of the sensitivity of tropism testing on treatment outcome of maraviroc-containing regimens. This paper discusses both the prospective and retrospective analyses of the MERIT data and highlights the impact of these results on daily practice in HIV care."
9640,0.005,1.0000,"The treatment of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV)-infected individuals has been historically marked by low sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in comparison to those without HIV infection, resulting in the Food and Drug Administration labeling those coinfected as a ""special population with an unmet medical need."" We systematically reviewed the treatment of chronic HCV infection in those infected with HIV. We propose that with the advent of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, patients coinfected with HCV and HIV have similar SVR rates as HCV-monoinfected persons and that DAAs address an unmet medical need in this population. A review was performed using Medical Subject Heading terms within the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases to search for studies dated between January 2004 and July 2017. Keywords used in the study included ""hepatitis C,"" ""HIV,"" ""coinfection,"" and ""direct-acting antiviral."" SVR rates for those with HCV and HIV coinfection treated with interferon-based therapies were substantially lower that SVR rates of HCV-monoinfected individuals. The advent of DAA agents has resulted in similar SVR rates between monoinfected and coinfected individuals, with SVR >93%. These medications have been demonstrated to have improved safety, efficacy, and tolerability in comparison to interferon-based regimens."
2635,0.005,1.0000,"Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) defining diseases and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is thought to relate with increased acute toxicity of chemoradiotherapy (CRT).We investigated the effect of HIV status in the incidence of neutropenia associated with cisplatin-based CRT for CC and its impact in treatment completion.This is a single-center retrospective cohort study. Data collection was performed for all the consecutive stage Ib-IV CC women treated with cisplatin-based CRT from 2012 to 2016, and with known HIV status.Sixty-one patients were included, 6 were HIV+. HIV+ patients had a higher risk of neutropenia at any cycle during cisplatin CRT [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 7.3, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.02-52.3; P‚Ää=‚Ää.05]. Despite the absolute differences, mean neutrophil count was nonsignificantly lower in HIV+ women, both at baseline [4455/ŒºL (interquartile range, IQR: 1830-6689) vs 6340 (IQR: 1720-18,970) for HIV-, P‚Ää=‚Ää.98] and at the end of treatment [1752/ŒºL (IQR: 1100-2930) vs 3147/ŒºL (IQR: 920-18,390) in HIV-; P‚Ää=‚Ää.06]. Moreover, when considering the effect of time, CRT seems to induce a consistent drop of neutrophils in both groups (P‚Ää=‚Ää.229). No febrile neutropenia events occurred.In HIV+ women, there were more CT cycle delays (P‚Ää=‚Ää.013), patients were more prone to use granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; HIV+ 40.0% vs HIV- 4.0%; P‚Ää=‚Ää.04) and less likely to complete at least 5 cycles of cisplatin (P‚Ää=‚Ää.02). All patients received adequate dose of pelvic RT, regardless of HIV status.HIV+ patients have a significantly increased risk of neutropenia during CRT treatment for CC and are less likely to complete chemotherapy with cisplatin."
9352,0.005,1.0000,"The p6 domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is located at the C terminus of the Gag precursor protein Pr55(Gag). Previous studies indicated that p6 plays a critical role in HIV-1 particle budding from virus-expressing HeLa cells. In this study, we performed a detailed mutational analysis of the N terminus of p6 to map the sequences required for efficient virus release. We observed that the highly conserved P-T/S-A-P motif located near the N terminus of p6 is remarkably sensitive to change; even conservative mutations in this sequence imposed profound virus release defects in HeLa cells. In contrast, single and double amino acid substitutions outside the P-T/S-A-P motif had no significant effect on particle release. The introduction of stop codons one or two residues beyond the P-T/S-A-P motif markedly impaired virion release, whereas truncation four residues beyond P-T/S-A-P had no effect on particle production in HeLa cells. By examining the effects of p6 mutation in biological and biochemical analyses and by electron microscopy, we defined the role of p6 in particle release and virus replication in a panel of T-cell and adherent cell lines and in primary lymphocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. We demonstrated that the effects of p6 mutation on virus replication are markedly cell type dependent. Intriguingly, even in T-cell lines and primary lymphocytes in which p6 mutations block virus replication, these changes had little or no effect on particle release. However, p6-mutant particles produced in T-cell lines and primary lymphocytes exhibited a defect in virion-virion detachment, resulting in the production of tethered chains of virions. Virus release in monocyte-derived macrophages was markedly inhibited by p6 mutation. To examine further the cell type-specific virus release defect in HeLa versus T cells, transient heterokaryons were produced between HeLa cells and the Jurkat T-cell line. These heterokaryons display a T-cell-like phenotype with respect to the requirement for p6 in particle release. The results described here define the role of p6 in virus replication in a wide range of cell types and reveal a strong cell type-dependent requirement for p6 in virus particle budding."
1647,0.005,1.0000,"In this study, we sought to characterize the T lymphocyte recovery in vertically HIV-1-infected children who respond to long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A 3-year longitudinal retrospective study was used to perform a cross-sectional study of 32 children rated according to the time course of CD4(+) T cell percentages in response to antiretroviral therapy and CDC clinical classification: (1) long-term asymptomatic (LTA group): 8 children in A1 during the whole follow-up period; (2) responsive to HAART (Rec group): 13 children in C3 before HAART who achieved CD4(+) T cell counts of > 500 cells/mm(3) after 3 years of HAART; and (3) nonresponsive to HAART (Non-Rec group): 11 children in C3 during the whole follow-up period despite 3 years of HAART. We also studied 17 healthy age-matched uninfected children as controls. Lymphoproliferative responses (LPRs) were evaluated by incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine, identification of T cell subsets by three-color flow cytometry, and determination of thymic production of T cells by quantification of T cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECs). Interestingly, the Rec group showed an increase in percentage of CD4(+) T cells and a decrease in viral load, and recovered LPRs to mitogens and recall antigens, with values similar to those of the LTA group. Moreover, the Rec group produced similar percentages and absolute counts of naive (CD45RA(+)CD62L(+)) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and TRECs similar to those of the LTA group. In particular, the Rec group produced similar percentages of CD8(+)CD28(-)CD57(+) and CD8(+)CD28(-)CD57(-) T cell subsets compared with controls. Our data indicate that among children who have already progressed to AIDS and severe immunodeficiency but who respond to HAART, the immune system can recover and resemble those of nonprogressors or even uninfected children, in quantitative as well as in functional terms."
9877,0.005,1.0000,"Nitric oxide (NO), a recently discovered free radical, is overproduced in liver cirrhosis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) might increase NO levels via increased inducible NO synthase (iNOS). This work was carried out to study the effect of HCV-induced liver cirrhosis on NO levels among Egyptian patients. The study included 46 patients with liver cirrhosis, and 30 healthy individuals of matched age and sex. NO levels determined as the stable endproduct nitrate, showed a statistically significant increase among patients compared to the control group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, NO levels increased proportionally with the severity of liver cirrhosis as assessed by Child's classification (P < 0.05). Moreover, schistosomial infection enhanced NO levels in cirrhotic patients with HCV infection compared to non-bilharzial patients (P < 0.001). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and branched DNA assays were used for detection of HCV RNA positivity, and measurement of the virus load, respectively. Both showed a positive correlation with the NO levels (P < 0.001). At a nitrate cutoff value of 70 micromol/L, the sensitivity and specificity were 83.0% and 73.0%, respectively. Chi square analysis showed a significant correlation between ALT levels and both HCV RNA positivity by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (P < 0.02), and virus load (P<0.05). Interestingly enough, there was a significant positive correlation between HCV RNA and schistosomal antibody titer as measured by hemaglutination inhibition assay (HAI) (P < 0.05). The data presented in this report indicated an association between NO levels and the development and progression of liver cirrhosis. Furthermore, the findings obtained from this study demonstrated that schistomiasis is an important risk factor involved in enhancement of NO levels and virus replication. The latter may aggravate liver cell injury and hence the development of cirrhosis."
1264,0.005,1.0000,"A 5-month-old white girl having persistent oral candidiasis was brought to medical attention because of acute respiratory distress, pneumonia, and hypoxia that worsened despite supportive care and antibiotics. Bronchial lavage fluid yielded Pneumocystis carinii. The diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was suspected, although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot tests were both negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Immunologic evaluation included the following results: a low normal CD4/CD8 ratio 0.88, CD4 lymphocytes 493/microL, and elevated IgA 539 mg/dL and IgM 175 mg/dL with normal IgG 492 mg/dL. Lymphocyte stimulation study results were depressed. Lymphocytes sent for culture were subsequently positive for HIV. The mother was HIV antibody positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot but belonged to no high-risk group and was asymptomatic except for chronic diarrhea. The father was HIV antibody negative. The patient was treated with pentamidine and IV gamma-globulin with good clinical response and a rapid decrease of IgM and IgA toward normal values. Subsequent candidal pneumonia and candidal esophagitis were treated successfully with amphotericin B. The patient has received prophylactic IV gamma-globulin infusions for 6 months and remains HIV negative by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. This case of pediatric AIDS highlights the need to consider HIV infection in the differential diagnosis of any child with physical findings or illnesses suggestive of AIDS-related complex or AIDS, even when HIV serologic findings are negative and parents belong to no high-risk group. Parental testing for HIV antibody is suggested in such cases."
4674,0.005,1.0000,"Between March 1986 and September 1990, 67 of 243 cardiac transplant recipients in outpatient care at our clinic became hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) positive after operation. The HBsAg of 63 patients belonged to the subtype ay, suggesting a common source of infection. These 63 cases and 103 controls with negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) serology were studied in order to analyse the outbreak. The sources of infection were patients who were chronic HBsAg carriers. Infection was transmitted at the time of endomyocardial biopsy, if performed on the same day and in the same room after biopsy of an HBsAg positive patient. The most likely mode of HBV transmission was droplet contamination of instruments and/or medication vials used for subsequent patients. Performing biopsies on HBsAg positive and negative patients in separate rooms resulted in the termination of the outbreak."
8313,0.005,1.0000,"The inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) have been associated with increased human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) expression and enhanced lymphocyte adhesion to trophoblastic cells in experimental systems. To determine if there is a correlation between the expression of these cytokines and the levels of HIV transcripts in trophoblasts of term placentas from HIV-infected women, we studied the placentae of 30 HIV-positive and 13 control gravidae. Twenty-three of the HIV-positive women received zidovudine (ZDV) as prophylaxis against HIV vertical transmission; only one of the seven women who did not receive ZDV was a transmitter, for an overall vertical transmission rate of 3.8%. Cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the supernatants of trophoblastic cell cultures. Additionally, cytokine transcripts and HIV gag sequences were determined by a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay. In general, trophoblastic cells of HIV-positive placentas expressed significantly higher levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha than those of control placentas. All placentas from HIV-positive women expressed HIV gag transcripts at either a low (<156 copies per microg of total RNA) or a high (>156 copies per microg of total RNA) level. There was a statistically significant positive association between the basal level of TNF-alpha production and the level of HIV gag transcripts of HIV-positive placental trophoblastic cells. Nevertheless, these data, coupled with a low transmission rate, would indicate that some other factors, perhaps working in concert with cytokines, are necessary for vertical transmission of HIV from mother to infant."
9264,0.005,1.0000,"Although infrequent, kidney disease is a potentially serious co-morbidity among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The spectrum of renal impairment is very wide from clinically insignificant to end stage renal disease and often requires nephrologist's consultation. Therefore, we established combined renal and HIV care in the HIV Out-Patient Clinic in Warsaw. Medical records of patients consulted by nephrologist from March 2014 to March 2015 were included in analyses. Patients changing medication without consulting the physician or persistently not coming for follow-up visits were defined as non-compliant. In statistical analyses, non-parametric tests and logistic regression models were used as appropriate. In total, 100 patients were consulted by a nephrologist during the study period. All patients were white Europeans, 88 (88%) male, 42 (42%) infected through men having sex with men and 16 (16%) through intravenous drug users. Fifteen (15%) patients had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and 11 (11%) confirmed with positive HCV RNA. The most common reasons for referral were proteinuria and increased serum creatinine. In 6 out of 31 patients (19.3% of those referred for increased creatinine level) elevated serum creatinine was due to illegal substances or diet supplements use. Fifty-seven (57%) of patients were non-compliant. In univariate logistic regression models, all tested factors were non-significant. In most cases, patients were referred to nephrologist due to possible link between laboratory abnormalities and antiretroviral treatment. In one out of five cases, elevated creatinine level was linked with substance/dietary abuse. Poor compliance is an important problem in integrated nephrological care, however we were not able to identify any factors associated with non-compliance."
7851,0.005,1.0000,"A 33-year-old Hispanic woman with newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a CD4 T-lymphocyte count of 2, viral load of 730,000 copies/mL, candidal esophagitis, seizure disorder, a history of bacterial pneumonia, and recent weight loss was admitted with tonic clonic seizure. On admission, her vital signs were: pulse of 88, respiration rate of 18, temperature of 37.7 degrees C, and blood pressure of 126/76. Her only medication was phenytoin. On examination, the patient was found to have multiple umbilicated papules on her face, as well as painful, erythematous, large, punched-out ulcers on the nose, face, trunk, and extremities of 3 months' duration (Fig. 1). The borders of the ulcers were irregular, raised, boggy, and undermined, while the base contained hemorrhagic exudate partially covered with necrotic eschar. The largest ulcer on the left mandible was 4 cm in diameter. The oral cavity was clear. Because of her subtherapeutic phenytoin level, the medication dose was adjusted, and she was empirically treated with Unasyn for presumptive bacterial infection. Chest radiograph and head computed tomography (CT) scan were within normal limits. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear was negative. Serologic studies, including Histoplasma antibodies, toxoplasmosis immunoglobulin M (IgM), rapid plasma reagin (RPR), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies were all negative. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was within normal limits without the presence of cryptococcal antigen. Blood and cerebrospinal cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were all negative. Viral culture from one of the lesions was also negative. The analysis of her complete blood count showed: white blood count, 2300/microl; hemoglobin, 8.5 g/dL; hematocrit, 25.7%; and platelets, 114,000/microl. Two days after admission, the dermatology service was asked to evaluate the patient. Although the umbilicated papules on the patient's face resembled lesions of molluscum contagiosum, other infectious processes considered in the differential diagnosis included histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and Penicillium marnefei. In addition, the morphology of the ulcers, particularly that on the left mandible, resembled lesions of pyoderma gangrenosum. A skin biopsy was performed on an ulcer on the chest. Histopathologic examination revealed granulomatous dermatitis with multiple budding yeast forms, predominantly within histiocytes, with few organisms residing extracellularly. Methenamine silver stain confirmed the presence of 2-4 microm fungal spores suggestive of Histoplasma capsulatum (Fig. 2). Because of the patient's deteriorating condition, intravenous amphotericin B was initiated after tissue culture was obtained. Within the first week of treatment, the skin lesions started to resolve. Histoplasma capsulatum was later isolated by culture, confirming the diagnosis. The patient was continued on amphotericin B for a total of 10 weeks, and was started on lamivudine, stavudine, and nelfinavir for her HIV infection during hospitalization. After amphotericin B therapy, the patient was placed on life-long suppressive therapy with itraconazole. Follow-up at 9 months after the initial presentation revealed no evidence of relapse of histoplasmosis."
9747,0.005,1.0000,"HIV treatment requires lifelong adherence to medication regimens that comprise inconvenient scheduling, adverse side effects, and lifestyle changes. Antiretroviral adherence and treatment fatigue have been inextricably linked. Adherence in HIV-infected populations has been well investigated; however, little is known about treatment fatigue. This review examines the current state of the literature on treatment fatigue among HIV populations and provides an overview of its etiology and potential consequences. Standard systematic research methods were used to gather published papers on treatment fatigue and HIV. Five databases were searched using PRISMA criteria. Of 1557 studies identified, 21 met the following inclusion criteria: (a) study participants were HIV-infected; (b) participants were prescribed antiretroviral medication; (c) the article referenced treatment fatigue; (d) the article was published in a peer-reviewed journal; and (e) text was available in English. Only seven articles operationally defined treatment fatigue, with three themes emerging throughout the definitions: (1) pill burden; (2) loss of desire to adhere to the regimen; and (3) nonadherence to regimens as a consequence of treatment fatigue. Based on these studies, treatment fatigue may be defined as ""decreased desire and motivation to maintain vigilance in adhering to a treatment regimen among patients prescribed long-term protocols."" The cause and course of treatment fatigue appear to vary by developmental stage. To date, only structured treatment interruptions have been examined as an intervention to reduce treatment fatigue in children and adults. No behavioral interventions have been developed to reduce treatment fatigue. Further, only qualitative studies have examined treatment fatigue conceptually. Studies designed to systematically assess treatment fatigue are needed. Increased understanding of the course and duration of treatment fatigue is expected to improve adherence interventions, thereby improving clinical outcomes for individuals living with HIV. "
2303,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-2-specific T lymphocyte proliferative responses were determined in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-2-exposed uninfected individuals, HIV-2-infected individuals and HIV-negative controls in Guinea-Bissau. Increased HIV-2-specific T lymphocyte proliferative responses were detected in both groups compared to HIV-negative controls (healthy HIV-uninfected individuals without known exposure to an HIV-infected person); five out of 29 of the HIV-2-exposed uninfected and half (16 of 32) of the HIV-2-infected individuals had stimulation indexes >2, compared to one out of 49 of the HIV-negative controls (P = 0.003 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The exposed uninfected individuals had reactivity to a HIV-2 V3-peptide corresponding to amino acids 311-326 of the envelope glycoprotein, while the HIV-2-infected people reacted mainly to HIV-2 whole viral lysate. Thus, this study demonstrates a high degree of HIV-2-specific T helper cell activity, as measured by lymphocyte proliferation, in HIV-2-exposed uninfected individuals as well as in HIV-2-infected subjects. These immune responses could be important for resistance to the infection and for the control of established infection and, thus, play a role in the lower transmission and progression of HIV-2 compared to HIV-1."
5132,0.005,1.0000,"The extent of human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type II (HTLV-II) infection and its rate of spread have been difficult to determine owing to the serological cross-reactivity between HTLV-I and HTLV-II. The present study overcame this problem by directly detecting type-specific proviral sequences by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and liquid hybridization. Screening was performed on a cohort of primarily white intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs), and individuals of other behaviorally defined risk groups from the New York City area. Eleven percent (19 of 169) of the individuals in these high-risk groups were determined by PCR to have HTLV-II proviral infections. One of these patients displayed an exfoliative erythrodermatitis. Thirteen of the 19 subjects were positive in an HTLV-II enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The remaining six individuals, although negative in the HTLV-II ELISA, were confirmed as HTLV-II positive by analyzing their DNA with a second HTLV-II-specific primer detector system. Four additional individuals were reactive in the HTLV-II ELISA but were PCR-negative for HTLV-II. PCR analysis for HTLV-I revealed that all four were positive for that virus. Thirty-seven percent (seven of 19) of the HTLV-II PCR-positive subjects were also PCR-positive for HTLV-I, and 84% (16 of 19) of the HTLV-II positive individuals were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Six individuals were triply infected with HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and HIV-1."
3989,0.005,1.0000,"This study was conducted to better understand the prognostic factors influencing the disease progression and mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in a high-middle-income country. This registry-based retrospective cohort study was conducted in Tehran from April 2004 to March 2014. We enrolled 2473 HIV-infected patients who had a medical record in Behavioral Diseases Counseling Centers. The outcomes of interest were the estimation of time: (1) from HIV diagnosis to AIDS progression and (2) from AIDS to AIDS-related death. The 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year probability of disease progression from HIV diagnosis to AIDS was 45.0%, 69.9%, and 90.4%, and that of AIDS-related death was 17.2%, 30.3%, and 39.2%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that AIDS progression was significantly associated with male sex (P = 0.022), an increase in age (P = 0.001), low educational levels (P = 0.001), and a decreased level of CD4 cell count (P = 0.001). Furthermore, the AIDS-related mortality was significantly associated with male sex (P = 0.010), tuberculosis coinfection (P = 0.001), and antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.001). The results of this study indicated that progression to AIDS and AIDS-related death is affected by several modifiable and non-modifiable predictors. We indicated that a substantial proportion of the HIV-positive people were unaware of their status and were diagnosed very late. This hidden source of HIV infection had the opportunity to transmit the infection to other people. "
5142,0.005,1.0000,"We have investigated hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in systemic necrotizing vasculitis (SNV). Our approach included the detection of the viral surface antigen (HBsAg) with a radioimmunoassay employing monoclonal anti-HBs (m-RIA); in addition, HBV DNA was looked for in serum and peripheral mononuclear blood cells. Among 28 subjects with SNV, 12 were found to be positive for HBsAg with the conventional test (p-RIA) and 7 additional subjects had anti-HBc and/or anti-HBs. From the 16 HBsAg negative individuals, 9 had HBsAg epitopes identified in serum with the m-RIA test and 1 had a low amount of circulating viral DNA. In contrast, only 1 among 6 subjects with other systemic vasculitis showed a positive test for m-RIA and HBV DNA assays; this individual had acquired HIV infection through transfusions which were also probably the source of his HBV infection. HBV DNA sequences were identified in peripheral mononuclear blood cells of 9 from the 37 tested, including 2 individuals who were HBsAg positive only with m-RIA. Therefore, our study indicates a much higher rate of HBV infection in patients with polyarteritis nodosa than previously suspected."
2558,0.005,1.0000,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is implicated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related manifestations. Increased PAF synthesis has been recently detected in HIV-infected patients. In this study, we examined in naive HIV-infected patients the in vivo effects of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen, containing tenofovir-DF/emtricitabine/efavirenz, on PAF metabolism. The specific activities of PAF basic biosynthetic enzymes, PAF-cholinephosphotransferase (PAF-CPT) and lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase (lyso-PAF-AT), but also the ones of PAF-basic catabolic enzymes, PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) in leukocytes and platelets, and lipoprotein-associated-phospholipase-A(2) (LpPLA(2)) in plasma, were measured in blood samples of eight asymptomatic naive male HIV-infected patients just before and after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment. CD4 cell counts, viral load, and several biochemical markers were also measured in the same blood samples of these patients. The repeated measures ANOVA and the Pearson r criterion were used to study statistical differences and correlations-partial correlations, while linear mixed models were conducted in order to estimate association(s) between time-dependent changes in these factors. Before treatment, the activities of PAF-CPT in leukocytes and LpPLA(2) in plasma were found to be inversely correlated with CD4 cell counts and positively correlated with the viral load. After 6 months of treatment, the activities of basic PAF-biosynthetic enzymes, PAF-CPT and lyso-PAF-AT, were both reduced in leukocytes. At 6 months, PAF-AH activity was also reduced in these cells, while LpPLA(2) remained stable. The reduction of PAF-CPT occurred even from the first month, while there is a time-dependent correlation between the increase of CD4 and the decrease of both viral load and PAF-CPT of leukocytes during treatment. Apart from its classical antiretroviral activities the tenofovir-DF/emtricitabine/efavirenz regimen also exhibited favorable effects on PAF metabolism and therefore may also display beneficial effects in some HIV-related conditions, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), in which PAF is implicated."
4758,0.005,1.0000,"The effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the treatment of HIV infection is usually measured by survival, CD4 lymphocyte counts, HIV-1 RNA viral load testing, and the occurrence of opportunistic infections. This pilot study sought to measure the impact of HAART treatments on a wide range of clinical outcomes and psychological variables in a sample of patients with advanced HIV infection. Seventy patients with advanced AIDS who were protease inhibitor na√Øve were started on HAART regimens. Patients were admitted to an AIDS inpatient unit of a long-term care facility that provides treatment and palliative care. All patients were diagnosed with AIDS, had CD4 cell counts below 300/cc(3), and had a projected survival of greater than one month. Patients were started on triple-drug HAART regimens with daily medical supervision and observation. In addition to standard clinical and laboratory markers, a series of observer-rated and self-report instruments were used to measure various physical and psychological factors (e.g., pain and symptom distress, psychological well-being, depression). Data were collected at baseline and after 1 and 3 months of HAART therapy. As expected, the CD4 count increased and viral load levels decreased significantly over the 3-month study period. In addition, patients improved significantly in body weight, and serum albumin and ferritin levels. The only psychosocial measure that improved significantly with treatment was depression. Ratings of pain intensity, physical and psychological symptom distress, and overall quality of life did not change. Of the 70 patients studied, 84.3% were still alive after the 3-month study period. Of these, 6 (8.6%) were discharged to community. However, 17 surviving patients (24.3%) had HAART regimens discontinued due to drug intolerance and 11 patients (15.7%) expired during the study period. While these data are preliminary, HAART regimens appear to have positive effects on CD4 count, HIV viral load, and several other measures of physical well-being in patients with advanced AIDS. Despite these improvements, the benefits of treatment on pain and symptom distress, and psychological well-being were less clear. In addition, treatment failure (mortality and intolerance) were not uncommon in this sample (40%). Further research is clearly necessary to better understand the benefits of HAART therapy in patients with advanced HIV infection."
9088,0.005,1.0000,"A HeLa T4+ cell line persistently infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was used in an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) system to explore its potential suitability as an alternative source of viral antigen for confirmatory IFA in HIV serology. In a study of 121 serum samples chosen because they were reactive on repeat examination by enzyme immunoassay but nonspecific by IFA by using HIV-1-infected H9 cells (H9 IFA) or gave discrepant results by enzyme immunoassay and H9 IFA, the specificity and sensitivity of the HeLa T4+ IFA were comparable to those of Western blot (immunoblot), and identification of the true positive samples among these discrepant or nonspecific samples by HeLa T4+ IFA was approximately twice that by H9 IFA. The primary advantages of using the HeLa cell line rather than lymphoid cell lines in IFA are that cells can be grown as a monolayer and that the individual cells are much larger. The cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus are easily discernible; this allows specific and nonspecific staining to be distinguished. At least eight different nonspecific nuclear and cytoplasmic staining patterns were identified in this study by using T4+ cells."

We present here an analysis of patients recorded in the cohort database between 1st of January 2006 and 31st of December 2008. During that period, 11982 patients were under medical follow-up in Belgium. Sixty-one percent of the patients were male and the median age was 39.8 at the time of first recorded viral load. Among the patients whose nationality or probable mode of transmission was recorded, nearly half (48.0%) were Belgian and 38.3% originated from Sub-Saharan Africa; heterosexual contacts were reported in the majority of cases (56.0%) followed by homosexual contacts (35.3%). A total of 145 deaths were reported. Around three quarters of the patients were on ART. The median CD4 cell count rose from 470 cells/mm3 in 2006 to 501 cells/mm3 in 2008. This cohort enabled us to obtain comprehensive information on the numbers and characteristics of HIV-infected patients currently being followed up in Belgium, and on trends in antiretroviral therapy and biological results. This will serve for planning purposes, evaluation of access to care and as a source of information for further studies."
7769,0.005,1.0000,"In this report we evaluate the human immune response to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) following remote infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBsAg-reactive lymphocytes can be readily demonstrated in the peripheral blood of individuals with established immunity following infection with HBV. In vitro stimulation with small doses of plasma-derived HBsAg, yeast-derived HBsAg (S region) or pre-S2 peptide will induce specific IgG to HBsAg (anti-HBs) in the absence of a polyclonal increase in total IgG. The pre-S2 peptide will stimulate, in a T cell-dependent fashion, the in vitro production of anti-HBs with specificity for the S domain. This anti-HBs production is mediated by pre-S2-stimulated soluble T-cell factors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with established immunity proliferate to the yeast-derived HBsAg but not to the plasma-derived HBsAg or pre-S2 peptide. The chronic HBsAg carriers do not produce anti-HBs following stimulation with HBsAg regardless of the source or component of antigen used. Different study protocols failed to demonstrate HBsAg-specific responses in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of chronic carriers."
50,0.005,1.0000,"This study explores whether previous failures on antiretroviral drug regimens preclude the possibility of immune restoration. This was assessed by evaluating T cell subset changes in individuals who received a salvage regimen of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) after initially failing protease inhibitor monotherapy. Ten HIV-1-infected asymptomatic patients received a regimen of indinavir, zidovudine, and 3TC after failing saquinavir monotherapy. Changes in absolute numbers of naive, memory, and activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing a selection of CD45RA, CD62L, CD45RO, HLA-DR, and CD38 markers were monitored prospectively over 6 months. These measurements were correlated with plasma viral load along with alterations in a selected CD8+ V alpha/Vbeta T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Over 6 months there was a progressive increase in numbers of CD4+ memory (CD45RA-CD62L+) and naive (CD45RA+CD62L+) T cells, which displayed a modest inverse correlation with viral load. Two phases of CD8+ memory cell changes were identified, consisting of a transient increase in CD45RA+CD62L- numbers after 2 months and thereafter a progressive rise in CD45RA-CD62L+ cells until 6 months. A strong correlation existed between reduced viral load and loss of activated CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+ cell numbers. There was also a temporary broadening of the CD8+ V alpha/Vbeta TCR repertoire at 8 weeks, which became skewed after 6 months in parallel with reduced viral suppression. Closer analysis of naive and memory cell subset proportions in individual patients revealed that enlarged pools of naive subsets were evident in those patients with rebounds in viral load. Overall, drug-experienced patients responding to HAART displayed increased numbers of naive and memory CD4+ subsets, and reduced CD8+ cell activation with a loss of TCR skewing."
1712,0.005,1.0000,"Many B cell abnormalities have been reported in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, including changes in the expression of mu, gamma, and CD22 molecules on the cell surface. Phenotypic changes in these markers on B cells isolated from HIV-seropositive patients with high or low levels of plasma viremia were measured. The phenotypic changes in B cells isolated from such patients were compared with the markers on B cells isolated from HIV-seronegative individuals using three-color flow cytometry. HIV patients showed a reduction in the proportion of mature B cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with B cells isolated from HIV-seronegative individuals. An increase in the proportion of B cells expressing both mu and gamma molecules on the cell surface was also seen in association with high-HIV plasma viremia. A low plasma viral load was accompanied by a reduction in the proportion of B cells expressing both mu and gamma molecules to a level comparable to those seen in HIV-seronegative individuals. HIV-seropositive individuals demonstrated an increase in the proportion of committed B cells, as indicated by an increase in the proportion of B cells expressing gamma molecules. This observation may explain the poor humoral response of HIV seropositive patients to neo-antigens. Our results demonstrate that phenotypic changes indicative of in vivo B cell activation and an increase in immature cells are associated with HIV infection, particularly with a high plasma viral load. Phenotypic changes in B cell markers may correlate with functional deficits of B cells."
8027,0.005,1.0000,"Parasitic infections continue to take their toll on HIV positive patients by influencing the blood qualitatively and quantitatively. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in relation to anaemia and CD4 counts among HIV-infected patients in Benin City, Nigeria. Using a serial sampling method, a total of 2000 HIV-infected patients were recruited on their first visit prior to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital from August 2007 to August 2009. Stool and blood samples were collected from each patient. The stool samples were processed using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique to microscopically identify the oocysts of Cryptosporidium species, Isospora belli, Cyclospora species and spores of Microsporidium species while saline and iodine preparations were used for identifying the ova, cysts and parasites of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Taenia spp and other parasites. The blood specimens were equally analyzed using the flow cytometry for CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and autoanalyzer - sysmex kx - 21 for haemoglobin concentration. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 93.3% while 18% had parasitic infections. There was a significant relationship between CD4 count <200cells/microL and anaemia (P<0.0001). Cryptosporidium species (P= 0.005), A. lumbricoides (P=0.035), hookworm and Taenia species (P=0.014) were associated with anaemia. Anaemia was associated with CD4 count while Cryptosporidium species, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species were the intestinal parasitic agents associated with anaemia. In conclusion the prevalence of anaemia in HIV-infected patients is high low CD4 count is a significant risk factor of acquiring anaemia. Except for isosporiasis, cryptosporidiosis, A. lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species in HIV infected individuals are parasitic agents associated with anaemia. Routine screening for intestinal parasites and holistic management of anaemia is advocated."
15,0.005,1.0000,"The great variability of protein sequences from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) isolates represents a major obstacle to the development of an effective vaccine against this virus. The surface protein (Env), which is the predominant target of neutralizing antibodies, is particularly variable. Here we examine the impact of variability among different HIV-1 subtypes (clades) on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activities, the other major component of the antiviral immune response. CTLs are produced not only against Env but also against other structural proteins, as well as some regulatory proteins. The genetic subtypes of HIV-1 were determined for Env and Gag from several patients infected either in France or in Africa. The cross-reactivities of the CTLs were tested with target cells expressing selected proteins from HIV-1 isolates of clade A or B or from HIV type 2 isolates. All African patients were infected with viruses belonging to clade A for Env and for Gag, except for one patient who was infected with a clade A Env-clade G Gag recombinant virus. All patients infected in France were infected with clade B viruses. The CTL responses obtained from all the African and all the French individuals tested showed frequent cross-reactions with proteins of the heterologous clade. Epitopes conserved between the viruses of clades A and B appeared especially frequent in Gag p24, Gag p18, integrase, and the central region of Nef. Cross-reactivity also existed among Gag epitopes of clades A, B, and G, as shown by the results for the patient infected with the clade A Env-clade G Gag recombinant virus. These results show that CTLs raised against viral antigens from different clades are able to cross-react, emphasizing the possibility of obtaining cross-immunizations for this part of the immune response in vaccinated individuals."
2323,0.005,1.0000,"A defect in specific T cell immunity has long been assumed to be the central mechanism of persistent Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Recent studies on HBV transgenic mice have suggested, however, that functional deficit of dendritic cells (DC) was an underlying cause for the T cell dysfunction. The functions of monocyte-derived DC were determined by studying 75 subjects that included chronic hepatitis B patients with low or high HBV load; antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) positive individuals who had recovered completely from previous acute HBV infection; healthy donors who had received hepatitis B vaccination and were anti-HBs positive; and immunologically na√Øve to HBV or the vaccine individual. Impaired interactions between monocyte-derived DC and T cells were shown in chronic HBV infection patients, especially in those with active virus replication. The dysfunctions included: (i) failure of DC to increase human leukocyte antigen (HLA-II), B7 expression and interleukin-12 secretion in responses to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), (ii) defective induction of T cell proliferative response to HBsAg, (iii) failure to activate T cells to produce cytokines and (iv) deficit in the induction of antigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In vitro treatment of DC with tumour necrosis factor-alpha improved HLA-II and B7 expression, as well as Th cell and CTL responses. It is concluded that defective DC-T cell interactions may account for the specific T cell immune defects in chronic HBV infection. Immunotherapy that aims at restoring DC functions could offer a new opportunity for effectively managing persistent HBV infections."
8122,0.005,1.0000,"This research describes major stressors in the lives of women who have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Thirty-one HIV antibody positive (HIV+) women infected primarily through heterosexual contact participated in a two hour semi-structured interview detailing the circumstances, context, and consequences of all stressful life events and difficulties experienced within the preceding six months. Qualitative methods of data analyses were utilized (Miles & Huberman, 1984). HIV-related life events and difficulties were classified into primary and secondary stressors based on the stress process model (Pearlin et al., 1981). Problems arising directly from one's seropositivity were defined as primary stressors. Stressful life events and difficulties occurring in other role areas were defined as secondary stressors. Six categories of HIV-related stressors were identified and quantified. Primary stressors were health-related, and included both gynecological problems (e.g., amenorrhea) and general symptoms of HIV infection (e.g., fatigue). Secondary stressors related to child and family (e.g., future guardianship of children), marital/partner relations (e.g., disclosure of HIV+ status), occupation (e.g., arranging time-off for medical appointments), economic problems (e.g., insurance ""hassles""), and social network events (e.g., death of friends from AIDS). This research indicates that HIV-positive women are exposed to multiple stressors; some may be viewed as unique to women, whereas others may be considered common to both sexes. Identification of stressors has implications for the design of medical and psychiatric interventions for women."
4651,0.005,1.0000,"Nine children aged 18 months to 17 years (mean 5.7 years) with chronic hepatitis b virus infection and chronic active hepatitis were treated with 5 to 6 million units/m2 of body surface area of interferon -alpha 2b administered subcutaneously three times per week for 4 months (n = 1) or 6 months (n = 8). At 12 months after the start of therapy, six children less than 3 years of age responded to the treatment (three completely and three partially), whereas only one of three children older than 7 years of age responded. We conclude that IFN treatment may be effective in children with chronic HBV infection, especially when administered while they are young."
2154,0.005,1.0000,"The pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) associated dementia in adults involves neuronal loss from discrete areas of the neocortex and subcortical regions, but the mechanism for neuronal death is poorly understood. Gene-directed cell death resulting in apoptosis is thought to be a normal feature of neuronal development, but little is known about neuronal apoptosis in disease states. We investigated whether HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system is spatially associated with apoptosis of neurons. Using an in situ technique to identify newly cleaved 3'-OH ends of DNA as a marker for apoptosis, we demonstrate the presence of apoptotic neurons in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia of children that had HIV-1 encephalitis with progressive encephalopathy. Furthermore, an association was observed between the localization of apoptotic neurons and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates containing HIV-1 infected macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Apoptotic neurons and p24-positive macrophages were observed infrequently in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia in children with HIV-1 infection without encephalitis or clinical encephalopathy. In nine control (HIV-1 negative) brains, ranging from the first post-natal month of life to 16.5 years of age, infrequent neuronal apoptosis was observed in three cases. These findings suggest that neuronal apoptosis is unlikely to be associated with post-natal development except in early post-natal germinal matrix, and that it may instead represent the end result of specific pathological processes, such as HIV-1 encephalitis."
7341,0.005,1.0000,"Dried blood spot (DBS) is a reliable method of blood collection used for the diagnosis of several human diseases. DBS is particularly useful for diagnosing children and for the screening of high-risk populations especially in countries where health facilities are not readily accessible. This report describes a qualitative SYBR Green-based real-time multiplex RT-PCR for the simultaneous detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomes in DBS. Specific viral amplicons were identified in the same sample by their distinctive melting temperatures. The analysis of scalar concentrations of the reference samples indicated that this multiplex procedure detects at least 2500 copies/ml of HCV and 400 copies/ml of HIV-1. HIV-1 and HCV viral loads in 20 patients infected with HIV-1 and/or HCV and in 5 healthy blood donors were also tested, confirming the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. This method may represent a reliable alternative for the detection of HIV-1/HCV co-infection, in rapid and relatively inexpensive screening programmes."
6945,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the central nervous system is associated with microglia activation and neuronal apoptosis, alterations that are also caused by the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein 120 (gp120) alone. This study was undertaken to examine the onset of gp120 neurotoxicity, the type of cell death and which cells of the adult rat brain are more sensitive to the toxic action of gp120. Gp120 or vehicle were injected chronically (daily for 3 or 7 days) into the lateral ventricle. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed hypertensive areas in the cortical and hippocampal gray matter in gp120-treated rats 7-10 days after the first injection, suggesting vasogenic edema. This phenomenon was accompanied by an enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles. Immunohistochemical analyses were then carried out to examine the toxic effect of gp120 at a cellular level. Several markers of apoptosis, including activated caspase-3 were observed at both 3 and 7 days throughout brains of gp120-treated rats, especially in the cerebral cortex. In this area, most of the apoptotic cells exhibited a pyramidal shape and were Nissl positive, indicative of neurons. Few non-neuronal cells exhibited signs of apoptosis. The results of the present study support the notion that gp120 is neurotoxic in vivo and provide evidence that gp120 activates a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway."
9807,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is an important public health concern worldwide, especially in developing countries, causing waterborne outbreaks as well as sporadic autochthonous hepatitis. China is usually considered to be a HEV-endemic area, but the prevalence of HEV infection in children in mainland China remains unclear. Between May 2013 and July 2014, a cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence and potential risk factors associated with the acquisition of HEV infection by children in China. A total of 1,500 healthy children (range 1-18; 942 and 558 from urban and rural areas, respectively) were recruited to examine for the presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics from the examined children were obtained. The overall seroprevalence of HEV in the examined children was 14.93%. Of these, 174 (11.60%) were positive for only anti-HEV IgG antibodies, 50 (3.33%) were IgM positive and IgG negative, and 44 (2.93%) were positive for both anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies. Age, type of residence area, contact with pigs, and source of drinking water were found to be associated with HEV infection. These findings demonstrated the high prevalence of HEV and the considerable potential for the transmission of HEV infection in children in China."
8165,0.005,1.0000,"Over the last few years, a relative decline of the morbidity and mortality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in industrialised countries has been observed due to the use of a potent combined therapy known as high active antiretroviral therapies (HAARTs). It has led to a decrease of viral load and a quantitative and qualitative improvement of immune function in patients, especially CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, having as a consequence a decrease of infectious complications and a global clinical improvement. Besides the positive effects of HAARTs on immune and metabolic alterations during HIV infection, it has been reported that the commonly used drugs AZT, ddI, and ddC are toxic to hepatocytes. Recent reports continue to point to the mitochondria as targets for toxicity. The prevalence of these symptoms is continued during acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The effects of oxidative stress occurring as a consequence of mitochondrial toxicity may amplify some of the pathophysiological and phenotypic events during infection. Mitochondrial stabilisation and antioxidative strategies are possible new therapeutic aims since the antiretroviral treatment is prolonged with increased longevity from AIDS, which has become a more manageable chronic illness. The aim of the present review article is to summarize the current knowledge about mitochondrial dysfunction during HAART and its consequence for patients with chronic treatment. Oxidative stress may serve as one pathway for cellular damage in AIDS and its treatment. One important future goal is to prevent or attenuate the side effects of HAART so that improved disease management can be achieved."

Similar to previous reports of hyperthyroidism due to IRD, all of our patients experienced a rapid early recovery in total CD4 count, but developed symptoms of hyperthyroidism on average 3 years (38 months) after beginning cART, which represents a longer time frame than previously reported. Awareness and recognition of this potential complication of cART, which may occur years after treatment initiation, will allow patients with immune restorative hyperthyroidism to receive timely therapy and avoid the long-term complications associated with undiagnosed thyroid disease."
7191,0.005,1.0000,"In our HIV outpatient centre where over 1,200 patients are followed, maraviroc as an entry inhibitor was introduced in 2010. We aimed to assess the background, the therapeutic challenges and the prospective monitoring of all patients treated with a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including maraviroc. Sixty-six patients started a maraviroc-containing cART with a history of HIV infection lasting 13.9¬±10.7 years. This interim analysis presents patients who had at least 12 (mean 16.9¬±12.8) months of follow-up. One to 17 previous cART changes prompted the introduction of maraviroc in rescue regimens in the great majority of patients considered (53 of 66); in 13 cases, maraviroc was given to patients with advanced HIV disease and no immune recovery after 2-3 years of a virologically-effective cART. The most frequent companion antiretroviral agents were: darunavir/ritonavir (51 cases), raltegravir (49 subjects), and etravirine (36 cases). The most common underlying conditions were: AIDS (41 cases), liver cirrhosis (21), AIDS-related or other malignancies (20 cases), major cardiovascular events (18 cases), osteonecrosis and haemodialysis-treated kidney failure (3 cases each). A chronic HCV and HBV hepatitis were of concern in 25 and 13 patients. The addition of maraviroc added favourably to clinical-laboratory markers of HIV disease progression, and those of comorbid conditions. HIV viraemia became (or remained) undetectable in 55 patients of 66 (83.3%). An improvement in CD4+ count was observed in all 66 patients, based on a mean 24.9¬±19.2% increase versus baseline, paralleled by an improvement in mean absolute CD4+ count of 134.7¬±121.1 cells/ŒºL. A tendency towards an increased mean and peak CD4+ count was observed in the subgroup receiving a maraviroc-raltegravir-based cART. As no clinical-laboratory adverse events attributable to maraviroc occurred, nobody discontinued the study drug. Only mild-transient gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue and anorexia, were reported during maraviroc administration, but their relationship with the study drug was difficult to assess because of the multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. Our preliminary experience with maraviroc, even considering the limits of the proportionally reduced sample, the patients' salvage stage of advanced disease and the related-unrelated morbidities, underlines its excellent efficacy and safety profile."
1792,0.005,1.0000,"Interactions between combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and lung cancer treatment are emerging clinical concerns. Among the reasons for that, one can observe the longer survival of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients since introduction of CART and the epidemiologic rising of lung cancer, mainly adenocarcinomas, in this population. In addition, the higher relative risk of lung cancer in HIV-infected patients compared with general population has been recently demonstrated. Patients' demography and disease characteristics differ from the general lung cancer population, although most cases occur in patients with a smoking history: HIV-infected subjects are generally younger and diagnosis frequently made at locally advanced or metastatic stages. The choice of cytotoxic chemotherapy and antiretroviral therapy is essential in the context of lung cancer (1) to minimize potential interactions and life-threatening toxicities particularly through cytochrome P450 interaction, (2) to implement adequate prevention of foreseeable toxicity, and (3) to fully reinforce antineoplastic and antiretroviral efficacy. Pharmacokinetics data and clinical cases pinpoint to potential life-threatening interactions between protease inhibitors/ritonavir and taxanes, vinca alkaloids, as well as the anilinoquinazolines erlotinib and gefitinib and irinotecan. Optimal choice of chemotherapy and CART in HIV-infected patients with lung cancer is an individualized multidisciplinary decision, involving clinical and antiretroviral history, and predicting potential adverse events and interactions."
2134,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 RNA level in plasma was evaluated as a surrogate marker for disease progression in a clinical trial of advanced HIV-1 infection. Baseline HIV-1 RNA level was an independent predictor of disease progression (relative hazard [RH] for each doubling of HIV-1 RNA level, 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.54; P = .02), after adjusting for the week 4 change in HIV-1 RNA level, baseline CD4 cell count, syncytium-inducing phenotype, clinical status at study entry, and therapy randomization. A 50% reduction in HIV-1 RNA level was associated with a 27% decrease in the adjusted risk of disease progression during the study (RH, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52-1.02; P = .07).

8369,0.005,1.0000,"In the literature there is no agreement on the prevalence of chronic liver disease (CLD) and the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in diabetics. We undertook an epidemiological case-control study of the prevalence of CLD and HBV infection in 394 diabetics and 265 healthy subjects from Seriate and Como. The results did not show any significant differences between: 1) the prevalence of CLD in the diabetic population and in controls (4.8% vs 4.5%); 2) the prevalence of HBV infection in diabetics (HBsAg+: 8.3%; HBVAb+: 55.8%) and in controls (HBsAg+: 8.6%; HBVAb+: 54.7%); 3) the prevalence of HBV infection in diabetics with CLD (HBsAg+: 21%; HBVAb+: 52.6%) and in controls with CLD (HBsAg+: 16.6%; HBVAb+: 50%); 4) the prevalence of HBV infection in diabetics with and without CLD (HBsAg+: 21% vs 7.7%; HBVAb+: 52.6% vs 56%); 5) the prevalence of HBV infection in diabetics treated by injection and orally (HBsAg+: 6.9% vs 8.6%; HBVAb+: 58.3% vs 55.2%). The relative risk of CLD for the factor HBsAg+ was 3.2 in the diabetic population vs 1.4 in controls. In view of the presence of antidelta antibodies (HDVAb) in 25% of HBsAg+ diabetics with CLD and the lack of HBV markers in 26.3% of diabetics with CLD, we assume that other viruses (Delta, nonA-nonB) may play roles. Probably the interaction of all possible etiopathogenetic factors (alcohol, viruses, glycometabolic derangement) is determinant for CLD in diabetics."
2463,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C is found in approximately a third of patients infected with HIV. Therapy of hepatitis C in HIV patients is very important from several view points. First, hepatitis C in the setting of immunosuppression may progress faster, although recent data show that mortality from liver disease was decreased in highly active antiretroviral therapy. HIV/hepatitis C coinfection is associated with more frequent elevation in liver tests (drug-induced liver injury) during highly active antiretroviral therapy, and in some studies, hepatitis C has been associated with lower CD4+ recoveries. The therapeutic standard of care is a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin at a fixed dose, 800 mg/day, although higher ribavirin doses may further improve virologic outcomes. In patients that do not respond virologically, maintenance therapy with peginterferon monotherapy is a potential avenue to stem the advance of liver fibrosis, although controlled data in coinfected patients are needed to issue formal recommendations."
4102,0.005,1.0000,"Viral mutations have been implicated in alteration of the biological phenotype of hepatitis B virus (HBV). We recently cloned and sequenced the viral genome of an HBV strain associated with an outbreak of fulminant hepatitis (FH strain). The FH strain contained numerous mutations in all genomic regions and was functionally characterized by a more efficient encapsidation of pregenomic RNA leading to highly enhanced replication. To define the responsible mutation(s) for the enhanced replication, we introduced individual mutations of the FH strain into a wild-type construct by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of viral replication showed that two adjacent mutations in the HBV core promotor (C to T at nucleotide 1768 and T to A at nucleotide 1770) led to high level replication. Similar to the FH strain, this mutant displayed the phenotype of enhanced encapsidation of pregenomic RNA. Functional studies in an encapsidation assay demonstrated that the identified mutations resulted in a minor increase of pregenomic RNA transcription (two- to threefold) and a major transcription-independent enhancement (> 10-fold) of viral encapsidation. Our results demonstrate that the two adjacent mutations in the HBV core promotor region are responsible for the enhanced replication of the FH strain. These two mutations, outside the previously described encapsidation signal, core, and polymerase polypeptides, appeared to affect a novel genetic element involved in viral encapsidation."

We analyzed the HBV DNA pre-C region in five members of a Turkish family. The mother presented an anti-HBe (+) CAH-B and the four children different hepatitis B virus serological and clinical profiles. The pre-C region was analyzed by cloning after DNA amplification in sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A method for rapid screening of a large number of cloned polymerase chain reaction products was developed for the presence of the most frequent pre-C mutations (G to A substitution at nucleotide position 1896 and 1899). At least 60 independent clones were tested for each patient by selective oligonucleotide hybridization using non-mutated (M0), one (M1) and two (M2) point-mutated probes. Results were confirmed by sequencing. The mutation 1896 was present in 91% of DNA clones from the mother. The same mutation was also found in 85% of the clones in the youngest child (D), but in less than 10% of the clones from children A and C. Only the pre-C wild-type strain was observed in child B. X gene deletions (3 to 20 nt) were also present in some clones from the mother and children A, B and C.

892,0.005,1.0000,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) provokes a disease in cats characterized by histopathological lesions similar to those observed in AIDS patients. In order to determine whether endothelial cells from brain microvessels are involved in the central nervous system disease to the same extent as macrophages and microglia, cells were isolated from healthy cat brains, cultured and infected in vitro with the FIV Villefranche IFFA 1/88 strain. The isolated cells displayed typical endothelial cell ultrastructural features and were characterized further by von Willebrand factor-labelling and the binding of specific lectins such as Ulex europaeus lectin on their membrane. They were also able to take up acetylated low density lipoproteins. Two weeks after infection, significant amounts of FIV p24 antigen were detected by indirect immunofluorescence in syncytia and single cells. Concomitantly, the same antigen could be detected in the culture medium of the infected cells by an ELISA technique. Numerous viral particles as well as different steps in the process of viral budding were observed under transmission electron microscopy. The synthesis of FIV p24 antigens still occurred in cells in which replication was blocked in the G2 phase with taxol. Our results suggest the possibility of a productive infection of brain microvascular endothelial cells by FIV in vivo, which could lead to important perturbations in the functions of the blood-brain barrier."

We examined the distribution of CCR5delta32 in 47 children (age range, 1.5 to 19 years), of whom 43 were infected with HIV, by the perinatal route (n = 41) or by the intravenous route (n = 2). The infected patients were classified as rapid progressors (RP) (n = 7) (CDC category C3 or death by 2 years of age), non-rapid progressors (NRP) (n = 17) (survival for > or =8 years after infection), or intermediate (n = 19). CCR5delta32 heterozygosity was found in two HIV-infected children, both NRP. None of the subjects were homozygous for CCR5delta32, and the remaining children had no evidence of CCR5delta32. The presence of CCR5delta32 heterozygosity in 4.8% of this, predominantly non-Caucasian population is consistent with the published distribution of the mutation. The finding that CCR5delta32 was present only in NRP and not in any RP is in agreement with previous reports suggesting that heterozygosity for CCR5delta32 may confer limited protection from disease progression."

Using the lowest and highest infectious clones of HIV obtained by the plaque-cloning method, a clear consistent synergism of infectivity and cytopathic effects was detected when different cell lines were coinfected with a mixture of the two clones. These data suggest that the emergence of a highly infectious variant of HIV due to mutation may modify the infectivity of a minimally infectious latent variant with the final progression of HIV infection to overt AIDS."

The aim of this study was to monitor HBV markers, to analyse pre-core-/core-mutations as well as to identify the viral population causing reinfection after OLT, and to investigate the emergence or disappearance of these mutants in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Fifty-four pre-and posttransplant serum samples of 17 patients were analysed. All patients underwent OLT for HBV-related liver disease and had HBV-DNA before and after OLT. Total DNA was extracted from all sera and a 240 bp fragment comprising the pre-core region of HBV was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pre-core mutants of HBV were determined by direct sequencing of these PCR products and by sequencing of PCR clones. Eight of 17 patients were infected with pre-core wildtype HBV before OLT (group A). Seven of eight patients of group A were reinfected by pre-core wildtype HBV after OLT. In one of eight patients in addition to wildtype HBV a mutant strain (nt. 1899 G-->A) was detected. Nine of 17 patients were infected with pre-core mutant HBV before OLT (group B). Six of nine patients of group B were reinfected with the same mutant population; in one, an additional pre-core mutation emerged; two patients lost pre-core mutant HBV (nt. 1896 and 1899 G-->A). In one of the latter two, a pre-core start-codon mutant (nt. 1816 G-->T), not detectable before OLT, emerged, in the other a nt. 1897 G-->A stop-codon mutant persisted. Five patients of each group were followed-up for more than 24 (25 to 58) months on immunosuppressive therapy. In all five patients of group A, pre-core wildtype of HBV persisted during long-term follow up. Two of five patients of group B were infected stably with a stop-codon HBV-mutant nt. 1896. In three patients, the nt. 1896 stop-codon mutant disappeared during immunosuppressive therapy. However, in one of the latter three, an HBV stop-codon mutant nt. 1897 persisted. In conclusion, most patients who underwent OLT for HBV-related disease were reinfected with the same virus population that existed before OLT. In rare cases, new mutants emerged after OLT or preexisting mutants were lost. During long-term follow-up on immunosuppressive therapy, in the majority of patients pre-core mutants disappeared and wildtype HBV became the predominant virus strain."
4382,0.005,1.0000,"We have been investigating a long-term nonprogressor who was found to be human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositive in 1985 and has survived with stable CD4+ T-cell counts (>1,000 CD4 cells/microl) without any AIDS-related illness. We have previously reported that repeated attempts to measure HIV-1 RNA in the peripheral mononuclear cells obtained from this subject have invariably failed. In the present study, we have analyzed the molecular nature of the HIV-1 quasispecies infecting this patient by PCR amplification of two proviral regions, the 5' long terminal repeat (5'LTR)/gag leader and the nef gene, directly from fresh uncultured peripheral mononuclear cells, followed by length polymorphism analysis (with 1994, 1995, and 1996 samples) and sequencing (with a 1996 sample). Only proviral forms with nef deletions were revealed by length polymorphism analysis in samples from all three time points. Sequence analysis of the nef gene from the 1996 sample confirmed the presence of similar proviral quasispecies characterized by the presence of several deletions located in the nef-alone and the nef/U3 overlapping regions. Length polymorphism analysis of the 5'LTR/gag leader region suggested the existence of two major quasispecies populations, one characterized by the presence of forms carrying deletions in the U3 region and the other showing a completely intact, full-length 5'LTR. Evidence of the role of nef gene defects in long-term survival of HIV-1-infected patients has been provided so far in two independent investigations involving patients infected with HIV through blood transfusion. Here we show the existence of a similar condition in a subject who acquired HIV-1 seropositivity through the sexual route."
6357,0.005,1.0000,"To identify the influence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype on development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and clinical outcome in chronic HBV infection, 26 consecutive cirrhotic patients infected with HBV subtype adw were investigated prospectively. HBV serology was undertaken using subtype-specific antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigens. The HBV genotype was determined by sequencing directly the polymerase chain reaction products of the HBV S gene. When HCC occurred, patients underwent transcatheter arterial embolization therapy. If tumor necrosis was incomplete, additional embolization therapy was carried out after a 3- to 4-month interval. At a median follow-up of 14.1 years (range 2.2 to 31.7), HCC occurred in 9 (35%) of 26 patients. Nineteen patients were infected with genotype B and 7 with genotype C. Four of the 19 genotype B patients (21%) and 5 of the 7 genotype C patients (71%) developed HCC (P = 0.058). Patient age (<45 years or 45 < or = ) at diagnosis of cirrhosis was the only significant independent factor influencing liver carcinogenesis by multiple logistic regression analysis and Cox's regression analysis (P = 0.0069 and 0.029, respectively). When analysis was limited to the age of 45 years or more at the last visit, genotype was the only contributory factor to HCC development by univariate analysis (P = 0.038). Whereas genotype B patients responded well to embolization therapy and had no recurrence of HCC for a prolonged period of time, genotype C patients showed poor responses and died of hepatic failure due to rapid HCC progression despite embolization therapy. The cumulative incidence of survival was significantly higher in the genotype B group (P = 0.0049). The HBV genotype correlated with the development of HCC, response to embolization therapy, and recurrence of HCC. Determination of HBV genotype may be useful in predicting outcomes in HBV subtype adw-related cirrhosis."

The cumulative incidence of HCC was highest among patients infected with group B HCV-1b, wherein the risk of HCC significantly increased compared with that among patients infected with group A (hazard ratio, 4.95 [95% CI, 1.43-17.11]) after adjustment for age and histological stage. This HCV-1b grouping may be a useful marker for detecting the risk of development of HCC."
7649,0.005,1.0000,"To assess whether there is an additive effect between chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 400 consecutive cirrhotic patients were followed prospectively with periodic abdominal ultrasound examination and measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level every 4 months. During a follow-up of 1185 person-years, 80 (20%) patients developed HCC, with an annual incidence of 6.8%. The annual incidence was 2.0% in patients negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV), 6.6% in patients with HBsAg alone, 7.0% in patients with anti-HCV alone and 13.3% in patients co-infected with HBV and HCV. There was a positive linear trend in the annual incidence of HCC among patients without either marker, patients with single viral infection and patients with dual viral infection (P[for trend] < 0.0001). Cox's proportional hazard model indicated that HCV/HBV co-infection [hazard ratio (HR), 6.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.80-22.80], anti-HCV alone (HR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.07-13.07) and HBsAg alone (HR, 4.06; 95% CI, 1.23-13.34) were independently risk factors of HCC. In conclusion, there is an additive and independent effect modification of HCV and HBV infection on HCC development."
6681,0.005,1.0000,"It is still controversial whether viral hepatitis co-infection can influence antiretroviral plasma drug concentrations and whether drug concentrations are correlated with liver enzyme elevations during highly active antiretroviral therapy. An analysis of data from a cohort of 220 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients was conducted. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were performed to identify predictors of plasma drug concentrations. The association of transaminase elevation with higher plasma drug concentrations was explored following stratification of patients into HIV monoinfected and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infected groups. Hepatitis co-infections were independently correlated with drug concentrations above the therapeutic cut-offs at Week 1 (P=0.06), Week 4 (P=0.04) and Week 12 (P=0.005). The apparent effect was independent of the possible impact exerted by other variables such as demographics and medication adherence. The incidence of relevant hypertransaminasaemia was low. Patients with hepatitis co-infections had higher rates of transaminase elevation than monoinfected HIV patients; however, risk of transaminase elevation was not associated with drug concentrations. The presence of HCV and/or HBV co-infections correlated with higher plasma drug concentrations, although it did not appear to influence hepatotoxicity risk."
5745,0.005,1.0000,"We report a case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arising in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) in whom both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) serological tests were negative. A 72-year-old woman was found to have HCC 10 years after a diagnosis of PBC. All serological tests for HBV and HCV were negative. Preoperative liver biopsy findings suggested moderately differentiated HCC. Dynamic computed tomography (CT) showed hypervascular tumors in segments IV and VII. At laparotomy, a 30-mm tumor was palpated in segment VII and a wedge resection was performed. The second tumor, which measured 10 mm in diameter, was detected in segment IV by abdominal ultrasound, and microwave coagulation therapy was done. HCC arising in hepatitis virus marker-negative PBC is rare and past reports do not clarify whether HBV or HCV infections are associated with HCC."
8314,0.005,1.0000,"The importance of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) level as a surrogate marker for viral load and a predictor of treatment response remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum HBsAg correlates with serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA during peginterferon (PEG-IFN) Œ±-2a treatment (with or without thymosin Œ±-1) in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B patients and whether it can predict treatment response. Sera from 37 HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients receiving 48-weeks PEG-IFN Œ±-2a with (n = 20) or without (n = 17) an initial 12-weeks thymosin Œ±-1 were obtained at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, 36, 48 (end of treatment), 56, 72, 84, and 96 (end of follow-up). Taqman HBV DNA tests (Roche) and Architect HBsAg QT (Abbott) were performed. There was a moderate correlation between the HBsAg and HBV DNA levels (r = 0.452, P < 0.001). Median HBsAg levels at baseline and at week 96 were 6,218 IU/ml and 4,038 IU/ml, respectively. The mean HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were 7.48 log(10) IU/ml and 173 IU/L at baseline and 5.37 log(10) IU/ml and 102 IU/L at week 96, respectively. A decrease to <60% of baseline levels of HBsAg at week 12 was identified as an independent predictive factor for HBeAg seroconversion (OR = 45.7, P < 0.05) at week 96. Serum HBsAg levels may be helpful for predicting the response to PEG-IFN therapy in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients."
4498,0.005,1.0000,"Acute exercise is known to activate the immune system and thus could lead to increased human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication. We sought to determine whether a single acute bout of exercise, similar to what people experience when starting an intensive exercise program, has a detrimental effect on plasma HIV RNA levels. Twenty-five patients with HIV infection performed one 15-min bout of acute exercise. Absolute neutrophil counts, serum creatine phosphokinase, and 72-h urinary 3-methylhistidine (a marker of muscle protein breakdown) were measured before and after the exercise, along with plasma HIV RNA levels. There were increases in neutrophil counts (P < 0.06), serum creatine phosphokinase (P < 0. 01), and urinary 3-methylhistidine (P < 0.01) in response to exercise, indicating a mild acute-phase response with muscle proteolysis. However, mean HIV RNA, which was elevated at baseline in 22 of the 25 subjects (mean of 4 x 10(5) +/- 0.7 x 10(5) copies/ml), did not increase during the week after exercise (P = 0. 12). Small changes in RNA were seen in the three subjects with initially undetectable HIV RNA, but the significance of these changes is unclear. Acute exercise does not have a deleterious effect on HIV replication in adults with high viral loads. Because regular exercise training has not been shown to activate the acute-phase response, the lack of increased viral loads in response to an acute exercise intervention suggests that exercise training is safe in people with HIV infection."
7352,0.005,1.0000,"The simultaneous detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to hepatitis B surface (anti-HBs) is unusual in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but may be related with more advanced liver diseases. This retrospective long-term cohort study was aimed to investigate whether coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs may increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic HBV infection. A total of 1,042 non-HCC patients were recruited and followed up for a median 4.3 years (range 1.0-22 years). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for HCC development. The prevalence of coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs was 7.0% (73/1,042). In univariate analysis, the 5-, 10-, and 15-year cumulative incidences of HCC were significantly higher in coexistence group than in HBsAg only group (12.7%, 23.4%, 69.4% vs. 4.9%, 13%, 20.6%, respectively; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.008). In multivariate analysis, coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs [Hazard ratio (HR), 2.001; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.023-3.912; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.043] as well as male gender [HR, 1.898; 95% CI, 0.31-0.896; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.018], age over 40 years [HR, 14.56; 95% CI, 4.499-47.08; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0001], and cirrhosis [HR, 7.995; 95% CI, 4.756-13.439; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0001] was identified as the independent factor for HCC development. Also, the cumulative incidence of HCC increased in proportion to the number of the risk factors. In conclusion, coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs may increase independently the risk of HCC development in chronic HBV infection. Therefore, consideration of HCC development is required in patients with coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs."
68,0.005,1.0000,"The authors have successfully used combination ganciclovir and foscarnet chemotherapy to control viral replication following liver transplantation in a patient with severe recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The disease was characterized by extremely high viraemias, deteriorating liver function, and high levels of intra-hepatic hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Treatment resulted in a greater than 30-fold reduction in serum HBV DNA and HBsAg levels. Liver function tests returned to normal and the histological progression of the disease was arrested. Hepatic cytoplasmic HBsAg decreased substantially but there was little change in HBcAg, implicating HBsAg rather than HBcAg in the liver injury. Combination antiviral chemotherapy using agents such as ganciclovir and foscarnet may offer a new approach to the management of post-transplant recurrence of HBV."
2483,0.005,1.0000,"Thalassemia is a congenital hemolytic disease caused by defective globin synthesis treated by blood transfusion. Transfusion-transmitted infections still make a great challenge in the management of patients with thalassemia major. The most important worldwide transfusion-transmitted infections are hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV. The objective of this study is to update the prevalence of the three major transfusion-transmitted infections HCV, HBV and HIV among thalassemic patients followed up in the Hematology Department, Children Hospital, Cairo University. The study included 174 multitransfused thalassemic patients (162 major and 12 intermedia), registered at the Pediatric Hematology Clinic, Cairo University. Their age ranged from 2 to 27 years with a mean of 11.26 ¬± 5.4 years. Patients were subjected to full history taking, stressing on history of blood transfusions (onset, frequency and duration) at a single or multiple centers and abdominal examination. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count, aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase), ferritin and viral markers of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) and anti-HIV were assayed for all cases by a third-generation ELISA method. HCV PCR was performed for 75 cases. Of the 174 patients, none of them were HBsAg and anti-HIV positive. However, 90 patients were anti-HCV positive (51.7%). HCV PCR was positive in 56 patients (74.3%) of the 75 with positive antibody tested. HCV antibody positivity is statistically significant with age of the patient, serum ferritin and liver transaminases (P < 0.01). HCV-RNA by PCR positivity was significantly related to patients' age and serum ferritin (P < 0.05). Serum ferritin showed statistically significant positive correlation with liver transaminases. Despite the decrease in prevalence of HCV antibody in our patients from 71% in 1995 to 51.7% in our study, yet HCV infection still represents a major health problem for our thalassemic patients, which requires more attention and efforts to challenge. There is a dramatic decrease in the prevalence of HBV infection over the last decade, thanks to mass compulsory vaccination and blood screening. HIV infection does not represent a problem owing to very low population prevalence."

2318,0.005,1.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI) is defined as the presence of HBV DNA in the liver (with or without detectable HBV DNA in serum) for individuals testing HBV surface antigen negative. Until recently, the clinical effect of OBI was unclear on the progression of liver disease; on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma; and on the risk for reactivation or transmission of HBV infection. Several studies suggest a high prevalence of OBI among patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease, but its role in the progression to cirrhosis remains unclear. Although OBI has been well documented in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, especially among those coinfected with hepatitis C virus, further studies are needed to determine its current clinical impact in HIV setting."
2343,0.005,1.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in chronic hepatitis C patient. However, its significance and consequences are still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of occult HBV among HCV chronic carriers in France and to assess its impact on liver histology and response to antiviral therapy. To this end a cohort of 203 patients with chronic hepatitis C without hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has been examined. Serum HBV-DNA was detected using a highly sensitive PCR with primers located in the S and X genes. HBV viraemia levels were further determined by real-time PCR. Results showed that 47 of 203 (23%) patients had occult HBV infection with a low HBV load (10(2)-10(4) copies/ml) but significantly higher HCV-RNA titers (P < 0.05). No significant difference in age, gender, serum ALT level, HCV genotypes, and the presence of anti-HBc was observed between patients with or without HBV-DNA. When compared histologically, patients with occult HBV infection had higher activity (A2-A3 in 53% vs. 38%, P < 0.01) and more advanced fibrosis (60% vs. 33%, P < 0.001) than HBV-DNA negative cases. Sustained response to combination therapy against Chronic hepatitis C was achieved in 11 (28%) of 40 HBV-DNA positive cases, compared with 65 (45%) of the 144 HBV-DNA negative cases (P < 0.05). Among the 144 HBV-DNA negative HCV patients those with genotype 1 responded less frequently to therapy as compared to other genotypes infected patients (38% vs. 55%, P < 0.05). Surprisingly, when considering all patients studied, irrespective to the HBV-DNA status no significant difference was observed in response to combination therapy regarding HCV genotypes (39% vs. 44%, P > 0.05). In conclusion, HBV-DNA is found in 1/4 of French chronic hepatitis C patients regardless of the presence of anti-HBc. Such an occult HBV co-infection is associated with more severe liver disease, higher HCV viral load and decreased response to antiviral therapy irrespective of HCV genotypes."
2249,0.005,1.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus (OBI) in HIV-infected groups is still debated, as well as the associated risk-factors and clinical significance. In this paper, we examined a total of 405 HBsAg-negative/HIV-infected patients enrolled from January 2007 to December 2009. Overall, the prevalence of OBI was 5.9% (95% confidence interval (CI(‚Çâ‚ÇÖ%): 3.8-8.7%); it was more frequently associated with ""anti-HBc alone"" serological marker (11.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 3.7, CI(‚Çâ‚ÇÖ%): 1.4-9.8), although it was also detected in the absence of any HBV serological marker (4.9%; CI(‚Çâ‚ÇÖ%): 2.3-9.1%). A low prevalence of anti-HCV-positive patients with OBI was found (3.1%; CI(‚Çâ‚ÇÖ%): 0.6-8.7%). HIV RNA plasma levels or other immunological/clinical characteristics were not significantly associated with OBI. All but one occult HBV infections were sustained by genotype D viral strains. OBI is relatively frequent in HIV-infected patients, although it does not seem to exert a relevant clinical impact. Viral genotypes in occult HBV infections reflect those circulating in the Mediterranean area."
9895,0.005,1.0000,"Previous studies have suggested that hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants may account for the presence of HBV DNA in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative patients (occult HBV infection). However, it is not known how widespread these variants are and how they influence the course of liver disease. To determine the prevalence of variants within the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBsAg, we investigated 2,565 subjects, including subjects with chronic hepatitis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hemodialysis patients, and blood donors. Fifty-one of them had occult HBV infection. The entire S gene from 46 of these patients was sequenced from amplified serum HBV DNA. Forty-three percent (20 of 46) had mutations in the MHR of HBsAg. Thirty-two amino acid substitutions between positions 100-160 of the MHR of HBsAg were detected in 18 patients, and these ranged from 1 to 4 per patient. These changes involved 11 positions inside and 5 outside of the historical first and second loops of the ""a"" determinant, and included the following: Q101K, T115A, K122N, T123A, T126N, Q129N, G130R, T131I, M133T, F134L, C138Y, K141E, P142S, G145R, N146S, and C147F/R. Combinations of mutations were detected in 9 patients, and 7 of these have not been described before. Two further patients had insertion mutations immediately before the ""a"" determinant. Monoclonal antibody binding tests with the Royal Free hepatitis B surface (RFHBs) panel of antibodies revealed decreased immunoreactivity in 6 novel variants of HBsAg. The existence of patients with occult HBV infection caused by HBsAg variants, therefore, has implications for their possible transmission through sexual contact and by blood transfusion."

Two different HBV genotypes were identified in this patient. A search of the medical literature indicated this report is the first to describe a multiple silent HBV infection in an HIV/HCV-coinfected-patient. The elevated incidence of the anti-HBc alone pattern in HIV-positive patients and the increasing number of silent HBV infections detected in those patients demonstrate the need to carefully examine HIV-positive patients for occult HBV infection. In addition, it appears necessary to thoroughly study such patients in order to evaluate the impact of mixed HBV infection and triple HIV/HCV/HBV infection on morbidity."
6451,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the dynamics of the K103N mutation following the withdrawal of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), we selected the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected patients with the mutation at the time or after the failure of an NNRTI-containing regimen from an observational database. Of 62 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 39 continued antiretroviral treatment without NNRTIs (group A), whereas 23 discontinued all antiretrovirals after NNRTI failure (group B). A total of 149 tests were analysed, with a median (IQR) of two (2-3) tests/patient. The overgrowth of wild-type virus at position 103 was observed in 14 subjects in group A (36%) and nine in group B (39%). No significant trend was found in relation to the disappearance of K103N variants in either group, but patients tested while receiving antiretrovirals had a significantly higher probability of retaining the K103N mutation over 24 months than those tested during treatment interruption (P = 0.007). In conclusion, following NNRTI discontinuation, HIV variants carrying the K103N mutation are not overgrown for long by wild-type quasispecies at this position in the majority of patients, although treatment interruption favours their disappearance. This suggests that the K103N mutation per se has little impact on viral fitness in vivo."
6464,0.005,1.0000,We identified an unusual case of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in a patient (GM43) who exhibited a persistently low antibody response and undetectable viral load during a 5-year follow-up period. GM43 harbored HIV-1 circulating recombinant form 01_AE with gross deletions in the nef/long terminal repeat (LTR) region. The sizes of the deletions increased progressively from 84 to >400 bp during the 5-year period. GM43 appeared to have acquired defective variants from her husband. The genetic alterations in the nef/LTR region were remarkably similar to those that have been reported in slow progressors (such as the slow progressors in the Sydney Blood Bank Cohort). The present study is the first report of slow disease progression due to gross genetic alterations in the nef/LTR region in a person infected with an HIV-1 non-subtype B strain.
1286,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) introduced in association with the luciferase reporter gene into Jurkat T cells was strongly activated by a combination of human neutrophils and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Activation was not observed when normal neutrophils were replaced by neutrophils which lack a respiratory burst, ie, from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), was strongly inhibited by catalase, was potentiated by vanadate, was stimulated by relatively low concentrations of azide, and was inhibited by selective inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC). The PMA affected activation in three ways: (1) by directly activating the LTR in Jurkat LTRluc; (2) by inducing a respiratory burst in neutrophils with the formation of H2O2; and (3) by increasing the sensitivity of Jurkat LTRluc to the activating effect of H2O2. When PMA was replaced by opsonized zymosan as the neutrophil stimulus, activation of the LTR was low unless azide was added. Activation in the presence of azide was not seen when CGD neutrophils were used or when catalase was added, suggesting that azide acts by inhibiting the degradation of H2O2. These findings indicate that activation of the HIV-1 LTR in Jurkat T cells can be induced by H2O2 released by neutrophils, particularly when PKC is concomitantly activated."
1182,0.005,1.0000,"Lifelong ART is essential to reducing HIV mortality and ending the epidemic, however the interplay between socioeconomic position and long-term outcomes of HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown. Furthering the understanding of factors related to long-term ART outcomes in this important region will aid the successful scale-up of ART programs. We enrolled 559 HIV-infected Ugandan adults starting ART in 2004-2005 at the Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala, Uganda and followed them for 10 years. We documented baseline employment status, regular household income, education level, housing description, physical ability, and CD4 count. Viral load was measured every six months. Proportional hazard regression tested for associations between baseline characteristics and 1) mortality, 2) virologic failure, and 3) mortality or virologic failure as a composite outcome. Over ten years 23% (n = 127) of participants died, 6% (n = 31) were lost-to-follow-up and 23% (107/472) experienced virologic treatment failure. In Kaplan-Meier analysis we observed an association between employment and mortality, with the highest cumulative probability of death occurring in unemployed individuals. In univariate analysis unemployment and disease severity were associated with mortality, but in multivariable analysis the only association with mortality was disease severity. We observed an association between higher household income and an increased incidence of both virologic failure and the combined outcome, and an association between self-employment and lower incidence of virologic failure and the combined outcome when compared to unemployment. Formal education level and housing status were unrelated to outcomes. It is feasible to achieve good ten-year survival, retention-in-care, and viral suppression in a socioeconomically diverse population in a resource-limited setting. Unemployment appears to be related to adverse 10-year ART outcomes. A low level of formal education does not appear to be a barrier to successful long-term ART."
6386,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to evaluate quality of life (QOL) and analyze its determinants among Cambodian adults living with HIV/AIDS who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART). A cross-sectional study was conducted using convenience sampling to select 150 adults 18 years of age or older from the patient population at the HIV/AIDS care hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. QOL was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life HIV BREF; socio-demographic characteristics, time elapsed since HIV diagnosis, months on ART, CD4 cell count, family and community support, depression, and anxiety were included in the survey. Results of the multiple regression analysis indicate that positive predictors of QOL included being female, being less 40 years old, having a household monthly income greater than 300 USD, having an education beyond the secondary level, or being employed. However, time elapsed since HIV diagnosis and duration of ART were not significantly associated with QOL and CD4 cell count and the World Health Organization clinical stage had little association with QOL. Perceiving oneself as healthy and happy and reporting no depression or anxiety were associated with a positive QOL. These findings suggest the importance of group-specific interventions to improve the QOL for those people living with HIV/AIDS in Cambodia who are male, have a low household income or education level, are unemployed, or are anxious or depressed."
8034,0.005,1.0000,"Replication-competent HIV, as well as HIV-1 DNA, has been detected in CD4 T cells and in monocytes during antiretroviral therapy (ART), indicating that these cells could represent an important viral reservoir. We measured HIV-1 DNA in monocytes and CD4 T cells in patients undergoing transient therapy interruption (TTI), to establish the dynamic of HIV-1 DNA burden and to find possible correlations with immune restoration and re-establishment of virological control after ART resumption. In most patients CD4 depletion and viral load rebound followed TTI. Rapid resumption of virological and immunological control was achieved after ART reintroduction. After TTI, in most cases a transient increase of both monocyte and CD4 HIV-1 DNA burden was observed. After ART reintroduction, both CD4 T cell and monocyte HIV-1 DNA copy number decreased, reaching baseline levels at the end of observation. At this time monocyte HIV-1 DNA burden was always undetectable, while CD4 T cell HIV-1 DNA burden was lower than at baseline. As CD4 T cell HIV-1 DNA values are independently associated with CD4 depletion, the increase of HIV-1 DNA burden in these cells after TTI is presumably due to acute infection, causing cell death. This is also supported by the pattern of 2-LTR appearance in these cells after TTI. HIV-1 DNA burden in monocytes and CD4 T cells show high correlation, suggesting reciprocal re-feeding of two cell populations. Repopulation by HIV these cells after TTI is temporary, and no significant changes of HIV-1 DNA burden were observed after ART resumption respect to pre-TTI period."
652,0.005,1.0000,"Purpose Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a multicentric tumor caused by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Unmet needs include therapies that are oral, anthracycline sparing, and deliverable in resource-limited settings. We evaluated pomalidomide, an oral immune modulatory agent, in patients with symptomatic KS. Methods The primary objectives were to assess tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and activity. Initial dosage level was 5 mg once per day for 21 days per 28-day cycle, with a de-escalated level of 3 mg if not tolerable, and aspirin 81 mg once per day thromboprophylaxis. HIV-infected patients required controlled viremia with either persistent KS despite 3 months of antiretroviral therapy (ART) or progressive KS despite 2 months of ART. Evaluations included tumor response and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Results Twenty-two patients were treated; 15 (68%) were HIV infected, 17 (77%) had advanced (T1) disease, and 19 (86%) previous KS therapy excluding ART. All were treated with 5 mg because no dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Over 156 cycles, the grade 3/4 adverse events possibly attributable to therapy were neutropenia (23 cycles, 10 patients), infection (1 cycle), and edema (1 cycle). Sixteen patients responded (73%; 95% CI, 50% to 89%): nine of 15 HIV-infected patients (60%; 95% CI, 32% to 84%) and all seven HIV-uninfected patients (100%; 95% CI, 59% to 100%). Median time to response was 4 weeks (range, 4 to 36 weeks). HRQL showed no impairment during therapy and improved satisfaction with appearance at end therapy ( P = .03). Significant increases in CD4"
3555,0.005,1.0000,"Sooty mangabeys (SMs) naturally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) do not develop AIDS despite high levels of virus replication. At present, the mechanisms underlying this disease resistance are poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that SIV-infected SMs avoid immunodeficiency as a result of virus replication occurring in infected cells that live significantly longer than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected human cells. To this end, we treated six SIV-infected SMs with potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) and longitudinally measured the decline in plasma viremia. We applied the same mathematical models used in HIV-infected individuals and observed that SMs naturally infected with SIV also present a two-phase decay of viremia following ART, with the bulk (92 to 99%) of virus replication sustained by short-lived cells (average life span, 1.06 days), and only 1 to 8% occurring in longer-lived cells. In addition, we observed that ART had a limited impact on CD4(+) T cells and the prevailing level of T-cell activation and proliferation in SIV-infected SMs. Collectively, these results suggest that in SIV-infected SMs, similar to HIV type 1-infected humans, short-lived activated CD4(+) T cells, rather than macrophages, are the main source of virus production. These findings indicate that a short in vivo life span of infected cells is a common feature of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic primate lentivirus infections and support a model for AIDS pathogenesis whereby the direct killing of infected cells by HIV is not the main determinant of disease progression."
4661,0.005,1.0000,"HIV establishes reservoirs of infected cells that persist despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). In most patients, the virus begins to replicate soon after treatment interruption. However, a low frequency of infected cells at the time of treatment interruption has been associated with delayed viral rebound. Likewise, individuals who control the infection spontaneously, so-called HIV-1 controllers (HICs), carry particularly low levels of infected cells. It is unclear, however, whether and how this small number of infected cells contributes to durable viral control. Here we compared 38 HICs with 12 patients on effective combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) and found that the low frequency of infected cells in the former subjects was associated both with less efficient viral reactivation in resting CD4(+) T cells and with less efficient virion production ex vivo We also found that a potent HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell response was present only in those HICs whose CD4(+) T cells produced virus ex vivo Long-term spontaneous control of HIV infection in HICs thus appears to be sustained on the basis of the inefficient reactivation of viruses from a limited number of infected cells and the capacity of HICs to activate a potent HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell response to counteract efficient viral reactivation events."
7306,0.005,1.0000,"Increased apoptosis of lymphocytes represents a key event of immune destruction in HIV infection. In this study it was investigated at which stage of the disease and in which T lymphocyte subpopulation (CD4+ or CD8+) protection against apoptosis may be lost as measured by decreased CD28 expression. In 26 HIV-infected and 20 healthy children, as well as 10 infants exposed to HIV, expression of CD28 and the apoptosis-related marker CD95 was studied by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. According to established Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions, children were divided into three immunologic categories. In the CD8 population, patients in category 1 already showed a markedly decreased mean CD28 (36.2%+/-16.1 SD) and increased CD95 expression (48.8+/-24.1%), compared with the age-matched control group (67.7+/-14.4%, 15.8+/-8.9%). In the CD4 population, mean CD28 and CD95 expression was not altered in category 1 patients. Of the exposed children, the child with the lowest CD28 expression on CD8 cells was determined later to be infected with HIV. Significant immunophenotypical alterations are observed in early stage pediatric HIV infection, which may indicate an early loss of protection against apoptosis in the CD8+ T cell population."
8958,0.005,1.0000,"We investigated the frequency of HBsAg clearance and the possible role of viral superinfection in a long-term follow-up of 184 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Our subjects were 184 patients with chronic hepatitis B and the follow-up was 12-216 months (mean 66.2 +/- 53.7 months). The investigative methods used were: immunoenzymatic assays for HBV, HCV, HDV, and HIV markers; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HBV DNA; and liver biopsy and immunoperoxidase. During the follow-up, 20 of the 184 patients cleared serum HBsAg. A comparison of patients with persistent HBsAg(group I) and of those who cleared this marker (group II) showed a significant difference in mortality (P = 0.002) between the two groups and a tendency to a more severe exacerbation (flare) in group II (P = 0.07). Antibodies to hepatitis C and D virus as well as antibodies to HIV were equally distributed in both groups. Thirteen patients (7.9%) from group I, but none from group II, subsequently developed hepatocellular carcinoma. These results suggest that the frequency of spontaneous clearance of HBsAg during chronic HBV infection is low. No determinant factor for the clearance was found, including the presence of liver cirrhosis. Serum HBV DNA was undetectable by PCR after clearance in 16 out of 17 patients."
242,0.005,1.0000,"To assess the epidemiology of infection with the delta agent associated with hepatitis B virus, sera from 1314 carriers of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 687 patients with hepatitis B collected in 1978-1981 from different regions of Italy were tested for delta antigen and antibody to the antigen (anti-delta), and the characteristics of delta-positive patients were analyzed. Anti-delta was found in each center participating in the study, indicating that delta infection has spread throughout Italy. Its prevalence was higher in carriers in southern Italy and in those with chronic hepatitis. In northern Italy, delta infection predominated among southern emigrants in industrial towns but also among parenteral drug addicts with hepatitis B virus infection. The prevalence of delta markers was variable and generally low in acute hepatitis B, suggesting that in Italy self-limited forms of delta infection occur sporadically or by limited outbreaks. Delta infection appears to be endemic in southern Italy but a new epidemiologic event in northern Italy, where it was probably introduced by southern emigrants and is presently exceeding its ethnic confinement to spread selectively in communities of drug addicts. Presumably, the endemicity of delta is maintained by transmission of this agent from carrier to carrier of the HBsAg."
8326,0.005,1.0000,"Prevalence and risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were studied in 2,587 pregnant women from three rural Egyptian villages in the Nile Delta being admitted to a prospective cohort study of maternal-infant transmission; 408 (15.8%) had antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) and 279 (10.8%) also had HCV-RNA. Fewer than 1% gave a history of jaundice or liver disease. Risk factors for anti-HCV included increasing age, low socioeconomic status and a history of blood transfusion or injection therapy for schistosomiasis. Sub-analyses after stratification of subjects by village revealed risks associated with specific venues for medical care, having a previous delivery attended by a traditional birth assistant (TBA), receiving medical care in a temporary clinic located in a mosque, overnight admission to a private doctor's clinic, and circumcision by a TBA or a 'health barber'. Our results suggest HCV causes very little detected illness in young adult Egyptian women and some sources of HCV transmission in rural Egypt in the past were associated with the provision of medical care and varied by location. Prevention should be focused on providing appropriate resources and health education should be given to formal and informal health care providers and should be sufficiently broad to adjust for local variations in exposures."
2274,0.005,1.0000,"Injection drug use accounts for most of the incident infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and for at least one-third of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Coinfection with HCV and HIV presents complex and challenging medical conditions. Ensuring access to and maintaining care for HIV and HCV for drug users presents special challenges to the health care team that require a nonjudgmental attitude, experience, and patience. Care for HCV infection, however, can be used as an instrument to engage drug-using persons in ongoing primary care relationships. Common elements to both care for HCV infection and primary care for HIV infection are testing for and counseling about HCV and HIV, substance abuse and mental health services, social support, and subspecialty referral. These elements, in particular treatment for substance abuse, can be focal points for model care systems that provide integrative care for both HCV and HIV infections."

HCV is parenterally transmitted and has been found in every part of the world. This cross-sectional study was conducted to establish the awareness and attitude about HCV infections among 210 full-time and part-time nursing students of the Medical College in Bitola, Macedonia from May to June 2009. For this purpose we used a self-administered questionnaire which consisted of three parts. The first included demographic data, the second included questions about causes of infection, mode of transmission, symptoms, acute and chronic hepatitis, and prevention, and the third questions about students' attitude toward patients with suspect or confirmed HCV infection. Full-time students showed higher HCV awareness (84 %) than part-time students (69 %). 58 % of the full-time and 79 % of the part-time students said they would not avoid professional contact with suspect or HCV infected patients. Our study has shown that even though both groups of students have a sufficient knowledge about HCV to face future challenges, they need further education on the subject. Practical recommendations would help to reduce stigmatising behaviour still further."
9021,0.005,1.0000,"The production of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) has been reported as being significantly associated with the gene polymorphism in the leader sequence at positions +29. The current study aimed to evaluate the associations between the polymorphism and the clinical characteristics of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). A total of 422 (252 men; mean age: 49.7 +/- 11.2 years) Taiwanese CHC patients with liver biopsies were enrolled. The TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism at position +29 (T or C), hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genotypes, and serum HCV RNA levels of these patients were determined. Of the 422 patients, the frequency of the T allele was 45.4%. Based on univariate analyses, a significantly lesser proportion of patients with allele T had high viral loads than those who were without allele T (P = 0.026). The lesser HCV RNA levels and HCV genotype 1b infection were significantly associated with the inheritance of the T allele in female patients based on univariate (P = 0.012 and 0.007, respectively) and multivariate regression (odds ratio/95% confidence interval: 0.434/0.219-0.859 and 0.468/0.237-0.927, respectively) analyses. In male patients with or without inheritance of the T allele, the clinical characteristics were similar. In conclusion, the association between TGF-beta1 polymorphism and virologic characteristics of chronic HCV infection implicated a significant role of host genetic factors on the clinical features of CHC. Female patients who carry T allele at position +29 were predisposed to be associated with HCV genotype non-1b infection and lesser HCV viral load, which revealed the gender effect."

Retrospective analysis of laboratory records for HIV, HBV, and HCV patients presenting at the HIV outpatient clinic. Serological data including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B e-antibody (anti-HBe), antibodies to HIV and HCV, anti-toxoplasmosis IgG and IgM antibodies, and anti-syphilis antibodies (VDRL) were collected. We obtained data for 628 (218 HCV, 268 HBV, and 142 HIV) patients. Male-to-female ratios were 1:1 for HCV, 3:4 for HBV, and 5:3 for HIV. Age means (SD) were 54.24 (16.40), 44.53 (18.83), and 40.39 (15.92) years for HCV, HBV, and HIV, respectively. In HIV group, the prevalence of HBV and HCV coinfections was 8.5% and 2.8%, respectively. In HBV group, the prevalence of HCV and HIV coinfections was 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively. In HCV group, HIV or HBV coinfections occurred at the same frequency (1.4%). An absence of screening for coinfections was detected in 7.0-48.5% patients as per the group and the infectious agent; which represents an estimated proportion of 20 out of 1,000 patients with an undiagnosed coinfection. Despite a relatively low prevalence of coinfections, a significant proportion of cases remain undiagnosed because of a lack of systematic screening. J. Med.

7695,0.005,1.0000,"Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy is an important intervention to prevent the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV and to promote maternal health. Early initiation of ART is particularly important to achieve viral suppression rapidly before delivery. However, current approaches to start ART in pregnancy may be problematic in many settings, with referrals between antenatal care (ANC) and ART services, and delays for patient preparation before ART initiation. These steps contribute to a sizable proportion of women failing to receive adequate duration of ART before delivery, increasing the risk of MTCT. To address these limitations, we developed the rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy (RAP) programme. The programme featured the use of point-of-care CD4 testing to identify ART-eligible women with CD4 cell counts ‚â§ 350 cells/¬µl; immediate ART initiation in women on the same day that eligibility was determined, if possible; and intensive counselling and support for ART initiation during the first few weeks on ART. We implemented RAP in an antenatal clinic setting in Cape Town South Africa. Between February and August 2011, a total of 221 HIV-infected women were referred to the programme for CD4 cell count testing and 101 (46%) were eligible for ART. Of these, 98 women (97%) started therapy during pregnancy, 89 (91%) on the day of referral to the service. In-depth interviews suggested that although there were substantial challenges facing HIV-infected women initiating ART in pregnancy, the availability of immediate services and counselling support played an important role in addressing these. While further research is needed, this evaluation demonstrates that a novel service delivery approach may facilitate rapid ART initiation in pregnancy."
8039,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States. Effective treatments are available, however adherence to treatment is challenging. Modified directly observed therapy (mDOT) with weekly administration of pegylated interferon might improve adherence and outcomes for patients infected with chronic HCV. The purpose of this study was to compare two treatment protocols and examine predictors of sustained virologic response (SVR). This retrospective review compares HCV treatment outcomes in two outpatient clinics at an urban academic medical center. Gastroenterology fellows provided standard treatment (SC) in one clinic; a nurse practitioner administered weekly pegylated interferon injections weekly in a primary care clinic. All patients received oral ribavirin. Data was extracted from the medical records of all treated patients over a 5-year period. 155 treatment-na√Øve, chronically infected HCV patients were treated. Ninety-seven patients received mDOT treatment and 58 received standard care. Mean age was 46¬†years. Genotype 1 represented 59¬†% of the sample. The mDOT patients were significantly more likely to be younger (44 vs. 50¬†years), have a history of injection drug use (93.1 vs. 50.0¬†%), and be HIV-infected (13.5 vs. 2¬†%) compared to SC patients. The overall SVR rate was 45.2¬†% and did not differ between the groups in unadjusted analyses (p¬†=¬†0.95). Genotype was the only predictor of SVR.

A questionnaire was administered to 203 HIV-positive men attending the HIV outpatient clinic of a central London teaching hospital. The main outcome measures were patient characteristics, numbers of patients registered with a GP, numbers of patients with a GP aware of their diagnosis, contacts with the GP in the last year and level of interest and shared care. Eighty-five per cent of patients were registered with a GP of whom 67% knew of the diagnosis. Those diagnosed for more than 2 years were significantly more likely to have an informed GP. A total of 73% of those registered had visited their GP in the previous year although only 27% had visited for an HIV-related problem. Only 19% had a GP actively involved in their HIV care. In all 51% of the patients indicated an interest in having shared care between the clinic and their GP. A high proportion of HIV patients are registered with and attend a GP although they rarely consult for HIV-related problems. A significant proportion of patients expressed interest in having shared care suggesting that there is the potential for increased GP involvement in the care of patients with HIV infection."
